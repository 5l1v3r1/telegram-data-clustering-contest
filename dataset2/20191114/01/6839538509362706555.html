      <p>Sparkling waters, golden sands and not another soul in sight – SA has got some of the best beaches in the world. But we bet you haven’t seen all of these.</p>
      <p>The 5067km stretch sets the scene for an ever-changing landscape – from expanses of golden sand to wave-ravaged cliffs – historic towns and wildlife.</p>
      <p>And it’s probably fair to say not too many people have seen as much of it as Moana photographer Che Chorley.</p>
      <p>Having spent the best part of six months following much of SA’s scalloped landscape on his bike – starting from the Nullarbor and proceeding up and down several peninsulas to its southernmost point east of Port Macdonnell – he is perfectly positioned to chat about the state’s coastal highlights.</p>
      <p>“One of the motivating factors behind this journey was for me to get out there and show the world our coastline,” Chorley, a keen surfer, says.</p>
      <p>“The coastline of SA has always really been an inspiration for me as an artist and as a person. I just wanted to show it for what it is – which is raw, spectacular and pretty unique. It’s also alive and healthy – it’s an honour to live in such a part of the world.”</p>

      <p>Chorley’s odyssey formed the basis of a photographic exhibition and a book, <i>Land Sea You and Me</i> – which is basically his love letter to SA’s life aquatic.</p>
      <p>Leaving behind his partner Myf and daughter Juniper, the-then 33-year-old set off from Eucla in July 2016. Trying to stick as close to the coast as possible and camping along the way, the solo adventurer wound up in Nelson, just across the Victorian border, in December. He then jumped back on the bike the following February for a week’s lap of Kangaroo Island to complete the ride.</p>
      <p>Chorley, who has a studio at the Fleurieu Arthouse in McLaren Vale, says the idea of “immersing himself in the landscape” was inspired by famed SA painter Hans Heysen.</p>
      <p>“In 2014 I won a landscape prize – the Heysen Prize – and had to give a talk to the sponsors to say thanks, which meant I had to do some research on Hans Heysen. I found out he used to go bush with his family in his caravan for periods of time and I thought ‘that’s the dream of the artist, to really immerse yourself’.</p>
      <p>“So Myf and I sat down and tried to work out the way of immersing myself in the landscape for a good period of time. I love the marriage of photography and adventure so we came up with this concept of me riding the entire length of coastline.</p>
      <p>“And it was pretty magical mate, I won’t lie to you,” he laughs. “It was truly spectacular.</p>
      <p>“It was a pretty stunning realisation to finish a journey like that. One of the biggest enjoyments I got out of the journey was meeting people along the way ... plenty stopped to say g’day and they were generous in showing me their world and favourite beaches.”</p>

      <p>Chorley says his ride underscored how “very lucky” South Australians are to have a diverse mix of coastal destinations within relatively easy reach.</p>
      <p>There’s also much to like from a photographer’s perspective, he says, such as the “incredible light”, “world-class sunsets over the sea” – and the chance to watch the weather roll in.</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to go far out of Adelaide to find some pretty untouched places,” he says. “Our clean seas and beaches are something I take much pride in, and once again, it really becomes apparent how lucky we are whenever I travel.</p>
      <p>“The biodiversity of our coastline is unmatched and much remains to yet be discovered.”</p>
      <p>There’s also much peace to be found on an empty beach, he says.</p>
      <p>“Having the option to photograph the dynamic nature of our coast while being the only person around allows time for reflection,” Chorley says. “I had some wondrous moments at the end of the day, sitting on the cliff top just watching the waves and marine life, with not a soul in sight or sound.”</p>

      <h3>CHE’S TOP SEVEN WONDERS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Pearson Island, about 70km off the coast of Elliston</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not just a journey highlight but a life highlight. Marine Parks and National Parks were very supportive of my journey and they flew me out here on a helicopter. It’s extraordinary. I call it a land before time. I think it’s how so much of our coastline would have looked before European settlement. It’s a big island – it takes a few hours to walk across. There’s just flora and fauna everywhere ... it’s got its own species of wallaby that’s found nowhere else on Earth. Everywhere you step there are lizards, little penguins and two species of sea lions that inhabit the area. It’s completely void of people. There’s a weather station there and that’s it.</p>
      <p>There’s no rubbish, no footprints – it’s just extraordinary.</p>

        <b>Blowhole Beach, Deep Creek</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love it there. It’s a hard track to get down to. It’s 100m wide and there’s some jagged rocks off the point that make it feel like you’re in a pretty safe cove. And then you’ve got the beautiful Deep Creek landscape that comes right down to the beach. It’s a special spot.</p>

        <b>Western River Cove, Northern Kangaroo Island</b>
      </p>
      <p>A little hidden gem of a beach. I’d been on the bike all day and for the last six kilometres I was just riding down this dirt road. So I literally did the downhill, got there, parked my bike and hopped straight into the water and went for a swim. It was summer by this stage. A storm rolled in, there were dolphins surrounding me ... it was just one of those spectacular places. And there was no one around as well – it’s one of those special moments you have.</p>

        <b>Nora Creina, near Robe</b>
      </p>
      <p>A complete revelation. I had horrid weather but it’s a place I want to go back to. It doesn’t look like South Australia. It’s a big giant bay with some islands separating it, so you’re protected and the water colour is pretty spectacular, even on a shitty day. And there’s a holiday shack vibe to the place as well.</p>

        <b>Memory Cove, Port Lincoln National Park</b>
      </p>
      <p>You have to book through National Parks and then they give you a key to a gate. It’s a long ride in and there’s only about 10 campsites there maximum, maybe less. Once again, another revelation. It’s where the forest meets the sea. On both sides of the cove, you’ve got healthy remnant vegetation meeting white sand beach and water ... literally, I thought I was in a tropical paradise here – except it was freezing. And there are islands out to sea as well which always makes it seem more tropical.</p>

        <b>Port Willunga</b>
      </p>
      <p>My favourite place on Earth ... I’ve just had some beautiful memories there with my family. There are the caves cut out there so you can escape the heat. The water there is beautiful and you get to watch the weather roll in ... and it’s also a photographer’s paradise as well. The sun sets in the right spot, you’ve got plenty of foreground and the water colour ... it’s magic.</p>

        <b>Fowlers Bay</b>
      </p>
      <p>The westernmost community on the coast in SA. Does have a history due to the fact it was a cross-country telegraph station back in the day. Built alongside these extraordinary sand dunes that are slowly moving and engulfing the fishing village there. These dunes form the literal and metaphorical backdrop to this town. And every night as the sun sets you get to see the light plan on the sand dunes. It’s beautiful. There’s also a bunch of whales who call Fowlers Bay home as well during winter time. Every year they come in and nurse their calves there.</p>
