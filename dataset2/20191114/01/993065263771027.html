      <h1>Man hit by bat in sectarian attack in Ballymena</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">CLAIRE SIMPSON</a></address>
      <p>A MAN was hit by a bat in a sectarian attack in Ballymena.</p>
      <p>Police said the man was walking along Sentry Hill at around 11.30am on Tuesday November 5 when he was attacked by several masked men.</p>
      <p>One of the gang was waving a knife.</p>
      <p>The victim was punched and hit with a bat before he managed to escape.</p>
      <p>Police said they are treating the attack as sectarian.</p>
      <p>"We are treating this as a sectarian-motivated hate crime â€“ the victim was subjected to verbal sectarian abuse during the attack," a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"Hate crimes have no place in today's society and will simply not be tolerated.</p>
      <p>"While this man managed to escape with minor physical injuries, such as bruising and cuts, we could have been looking at a very different picture.</p>
      <p>"He has, understandably, been left badly shaken by a dreadful ordeal."</p>
      <p>Police appealed to anyone with information to contact them on 101.</p>
      <p>In May 2006, 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen died after he was kicked and beaten with a baseball bat in an alleyway in Ballymena.</p>
