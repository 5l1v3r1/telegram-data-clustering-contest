      <p>Junior dos Santos was forced out of a December bout due to a staph infection, but the UFC has apparently re-booked him for six weeks after that. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28073539/sources-junior-dos-santos-curtis-blaydes-set-jan-25">According to a report from ESPN</a>, JDS is set to meet Curtis Blaydes in the main event of UFC Raleigh on January 25th.</p>
      <p>The bout has been verbally agreed to but hasnâ€™t been completely finalized, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Dos Santos (21-6, 15-5 UFC) had a three-fight winning streak snapped by Francis Ngannou, who stopped the former champ in just 71 seconds in June.</p>
      <p>Blaydes (12-2, 1 NC, 7-2, 1 NC UFC) has won two fights in a row, most recently defeating Shamil Abdurakhimov via TKO in September. His only two losses in the UFC have come at the hands of the aforementioned Ngannou.</p>
      <p>Blaydes is currently ranked as the number three contender in the official UFC rankings. Dos Santos currently sits at four.</p>
      <p>UFC Raleigh will go down in the PNC Arena on January 25th.</p>
