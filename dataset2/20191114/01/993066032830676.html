      <p>The Bloody Sunday Trust has welcomed a decision by the loyalist Clyde Valley flute band not to take part in next month’s Lundy’s Day march through Derry.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/13/news/loyalist-band-will-not-take-part-in-derry-march-1763969/">As reported in yesterday's Irish News</a>, band members decided not to attend the December 7 Apprentice Boys march <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/08/14/news/unionist-leaders-meet-police-over-relief-of-derry-march-1684200/">following widespread condemnation</a> of their decision to wear pro-Parachute Regiment and pro-Soldier F insignia when they marched in Derry in August.</p>
      <p>The band has now submitted notification of plans to march in Larne on December 7 with specific notification that it will not parade in any other town on the day.</p>
      <p>Bloody Sunday Trust chairman, Tony Doherty welcomed the news.</p>

      <p>"The Bloody Sunday Trust welcomes the statement from the Apprentice Boys of Derry regarding the December parade and their commitment to keep working positively and in collaboration with others to promote respect for diversity within the city, region and beyond," he said.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to a peaceful and respectful event on 7th December.”</p>
      <p>Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse issued a statement calling on all those taking part in next months’ parade to “respect good relations” while in the city.</p>
      <p>SDLP leader Colum Eastwood paid tribute to those who worked to “repair relations in the city after the deep hurt caused over the summer”.</p>
      <p>Mr Eastwood said: “It was divisive and caused deep pain.</p>
      <p>“The thoughtful and considered response from the Apprentice Boys in the aftermath was welcome and demonstrated the spirit of compromise, accommodation and respect that has allowed the Derry Model of parading to endure.</p>
      <p>“The decision that the Clyde Valley band will not march during Lundy’s Day is another step on the road to healing this summer’s pain. It shows that those involved have reflected on what happened and we should give them credit for that.”</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin MP, Elisha McCallion said tolerance and respect was the way forward.</p>
      <p>“The successful parading atmosphere in the city over many years was brought about through dialogue and respect and it is essential that continues, particularly in light of recent events in the city.</p>
      <p>“I want to commend the Bloody Sunday families for the dignified and respectful manner in which they have approached this matter,” Ms McCallion said.</p>
