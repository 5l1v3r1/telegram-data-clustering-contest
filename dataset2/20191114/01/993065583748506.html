      <p>STRIKE action by the north's biggest nursing trade union has been set for December 18.</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/healthcarenews/2019/11/13/news/nurses-will-strike-on-december-18-rcn-confirms-1764884/">yesterday confirmed that its UK Council had approved the 12-hour action</a>, when thousands of staff are expected to take to the picket lines for the first time in the organisation's 103-year history.</p>
      <p>Industrial action short of strike will also take place during the first fortnight in December on a "phased" basis, when nurses will "decline" doing any tasks that are not "patient specific" such as paperwork, unpaid hours and answering telephones on hospital wards.</p>
      <p>The dispute centres on staffing and pay.</p>

      <p>The first phase will begin on December 3 and also includes:</p>
      <p>- no bank or overtime shifts on days of industrial action</p>
      <p>- not preparing or cleaning empty beds when a patient is discharged</p>
      <p>- not accompanying patients to tests and investigations unless there is an identified medical requirement</p>
      <p>- no administrative tasks apart from paperwork involving individual patient records</p>
      <p>- not collecting prescriptions or pharmacy in the community</p>
      <p>- not collecting or delivering blood samples in the community</p>
      <p>- not attending meetings including bed management or bed co-ordination meetings</p>
      <p>- not attending any regional or local meetings, conferences or non-mandatory training.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, RCN director Pat Cullen told The Irish News that an all-out strike looked likely for the new year but they were still willing to engage in "dialogue" with the Department of Health.</p>
      <p>However, following a union board meeting on Monday, the strike has now been brought forward to the week before Christmas.</p>
      <p>The December 18 action will be staged between 8am and 8pm but it remains unclear what patient services will be affected by the "withdrawal of labour" - with proposals to go before the RCN Council in London later this month.</p>
      <p>What the trade union describe as "targeted strike action" will take also place on several dates up to the first week in March 2020, during which time specific services will be affected on particular days.</p>
      <p>It is expected the RCN will follow the lead of their counterparts in the Republic, who staged a strike earlier this year that led to thousands of cancelled routine operations and procedures.</p>
      <p>Children's services and care for those will severe learning disabilities were "off the table" but A&amp;E units were hit.</p>
      <p>'Targeted' services by the Republic's Irish Nurses and Midwife Organisation trade union included operating theatres and outpatient treatment.</p>
      <p>Negotiations between the RCN and the Department of Health have been ongoing for over a year, but have been confined to the pay offer.</p>
      <p>"We have not found a room where discussions have commenced about safe staffing and how we're going to address the 3,000 vacancies - the talks haven't touched on this," Ms Cullen said last night.</p>

      <p>"If someone would tell us what table to get round we will do that, night or day we’ll make ourselves available."</p>
      <p>The union announced last week that 92 per cent of members balloted had voted to strike, while 96 had backed industrial action. The response rate to the ballot was 43 per cent.</p>
      <p>The nursing chief said her members are "very disappointed" about the lack of what she described as "meaningful engagement" with the department.</p>
      <p>"RCN Council has now approved a schedule of industrial action and strike action. Regrettably this will begin before the Christmas period. We are now putting plans in place to determine how this will be managed and delivered," Ms Cullen said.</p>
      <p>"While no nurse wants to take this action, unfortunately we have been left with no choice and we are now carrying out the instructions that our members have clearly voted for. We will have further details on the impact this will have upon services closer to the time."</p>
      <p>Two further dates of industrial action, short of strike action, will take place on December 10 and 11.</p>
      <p>A Department of Health spokesman said its position had not changed since last week and that it "remains focussed on finding a way forward".</p>
      <p>"In this context we are currently finalising a formal pay offer for 2019/20," he said.</p>
      <p>"This will be the best offer possible within the budget available, but the reality is that our ability to address pay issues is inevitably constrained at a time of intense budgetary pressures for health and social care services. These budgetary pressures are clear for all to see, and we have been highlighting these for some considerable time.</p>
      <p>"Despite claims to the contrary, there is no separate or untapped source of funding that we can access – nor can money simply be found in the budget. As with any other item of expenditure, pay costs come out of the one health budget, which is currently overcommitted. Every pound spent on one priority area is a pound not available for another."</p>
