      <p>IF THERE'S one time of year when the milk of human kindness can be aggressively sweetened with saccharine sentimentality, it's Christmas.</p>
      <p>Dame Emma Thompson and co-writer Bryony Kimmings merrily spoon in the sugar to their seasonal romantic comedy while Bridemaids director Paul Feig unwraps cliches to a soundtrack of George Michael's hits.</p>
      <p>His music is timeless and beautiful, providing gentle emotional crescendos on screen including a romantic ice skate to Praying For Time and a moment of self-preservation that echoes the lyrics of Heal The Pain.</p>
      <p>Alas, the narrative twist on which the film precariously hangs is glaringly obvious and – in retrospect – illogical.</p>
      <p>One intimate scene strains plausibility while another is a blatant cheat, presumably to throw us off the scent, and couldn't unfold as depicted.</p>
      <p>The film's emotionally scarred heroine, played with an elfish grin by Emilia Clarke, is thoroughly unlikeable and unsympathetic for the opening hour a la Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.</p>
      <p>Thompson and Kimmings set themselves the impossible task of redeeming her in time for a tinsel-bedazzled redemption set to the bouncy title track.</p>
      <p>"My God, I thought you were someone to rely on," laments George Michael in one of the verses. Regrettably, we could sing that back to the scriptwriters.</p>
      <p>Thirtysomething hot mess Kate (Clarke) ricochets between auditions for West End stage roles while fitfully holding down a job as a sales elf at the Yuletide Wonderful shop in Covent Garden.</p>
      <p>Her boss Santa (Michelle Yeoh) implores her to take pride in her work but Kate is blinkered to the destruction she leaves in her wake.</p>
      <p>Staring out of the shop's window one morning, she is irresistibly drawn to handsome stranger Tom (Henry Golding), who volunteers at a homeless shelter.</p>
      <p>He is selfless, sensitive and socially conscious – everything Kate is not – and shepherds her on a tour of historic back alleys to prove she spends too much time looking down or engrossed in a touchscreen.</p>
      <p>"Has anyone ever told you there's something slightly serial killery about you?" she awkwardly jests.</p>
      <p>Tom's wholesome, positive influence compels Kate to think of others. She engineers romance between Santa and a smitten Dutch customer (Peter Mygind) and slowly repairs fractured relationships with her browbeating Croatian mother (Thompson) and older sister (Lydia Leonard).</p>
      <p>Last Christmas cloys and contrives when it should charm and serenade with that gorgeous soundtrack, including an upbeat new George Michael track over the end credits.</p>
      <p>Clarke and Golding are an exceedingly attractive pairing and Yeoh is hysterical in a rare comic role, which she plays to the pantomime hilt.</p>
      <p>Feig's film, though, is a bauble – beautifully decorated and easy on the eye but hollow. Humbugs, anyone?</p>
