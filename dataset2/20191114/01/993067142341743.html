        <b>The Irish News, November 14 209: BT Rannafast Cup semi-final: St Patrick’s, Armagh 1-9 St Patrick’s, Dungannon 1-7 (After extra-time)</b>
      </p>
      <p>St Patrick’s, Armagh dethroned Rannafast Cup holders St Patrick’s, Dungannon in an enthralling semi-final in Ballygawley yesterday afternoon and it was two Errigal Ciaran clubmen that masterminded the Armagh success.</p>
      <p>John Devine and Davy Harte returned from Railway Cup duty to watch as Niall Patterson’s free, four minutes from the end, forced extra-time in a low-scoring, edge-of-the-seat tie between two well-drilled outfits.</p>
      <p>A goal from John Loughran put the Academy into a 1-2 to 0-1 lead, Armagh’s point scored by Ryan McShane.</p>
      <p>However, Sean McLaughlin hit the net for Armagh in the 23rd minute and only a point, 1-3 to 1-2, separated the sides at the break.</p>
      <p>Points from Aidan McGarrity and Kevin O’Gorman looked like squeezing the Academy through until Patterson’s late leveller.</p>
      <p>Patterson then floated over three frees in extra-time with wing-back Michael Carson another.</p>
      <p>The Academy could only manage two points – one each for Stefan Lavery and Ryan Devlin.</p>
      <p>Carson and Conor White stood out in the winners’ defence with Matthew Jones and Patterson’s frees also catching the eye. While Niall Dillon, Sean Molloy and McGarrity certainly didn’t deserve to lose out.</p>
      <p>Armagh: S McLaughlin (1-0), N Patterson (0-5), M Carson (0-1), R McShane (0-1), T Donnelly (0-1), T Murphy (0-1)</p>
      <p>Academy: J Loughran (1-0), A McGarrity (0-2), S Lavery (0-2), K O’Gorman (0-2), R Devlin (0-1).</p>
