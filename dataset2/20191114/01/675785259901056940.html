      <p>Three cows have miraculously survived being swept out to sea in a 'mini-tsunami' caused by Hurricane Dorian.</p>
      <p>The cattle were washed five miles out to sea when the hurricane resulted in flooding on Cedar Island, in North Carolina, in September.</p>
      <p>The animals were found on the Outer Banks, a group of islands off the coast of the US state, in between the mainland and the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>Cape Lookout National Seashore spokesman B.G. Horvat reportedly said the bovines were lucky to have avoided being dragged out into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
      <p>He added that if the cows could talk they would have a 'gripping story to share'.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/hurricane-dorian-cows.html?auth=login-email&amp;fbclid=IwAR0B6n3RXYW2rRg7Uuh3M_SpFJ3QnoFrQ-QDgXykAnGsc2dil2onrJZddA0&amp;login=email&amp;smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">New York Times</a> , Mr Horvat said: "It’s a tremendous story of how they made it.</p>
      <p>"If the cows could talk, imagine the story they can tell you of enduring that rush of water.</p>
      <p>"That must be incredible. Ever since they found each other, they have been hanging out together. They are just grazing on the North Core Island."</p>
      <p>The 'wall of water' was caused by a change in winds, blowing the overflow from bursting rivers onto the island.</p>

      <p>The authorities are waiting for the owner of the three cows to step forward and arrange for them to be transported from the North Core Island.</p>
      <p>The animals were washed away by an 8ft 'mini-tsunami', which killed at least 28 wild horses on Cedar Island.</p>
      <p>Nena Hancock, owner of the horses, said she would be happy to help get the cows back home safe.</p>
      <p>A huge herd of livestock graze on a 1,000-acre area of land on Cedar Island.</p>
