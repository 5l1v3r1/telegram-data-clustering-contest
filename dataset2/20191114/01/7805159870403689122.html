      <h1>GitHub will soon release an Android app with dark mode support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:37:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft’s GitHub, which is the largest repository of open-source software in the world, is finally getting its own mobile apps. The company made the announcement at the recent GitHub Universe event in San Francisco, detailing the capabilities of the upcoming app. As per a recent blog post from the company, the GitHub app will allow developers to review code and share feedback right on their phone. The company claims that the upcoming app will automatically adapt to all screen sized and it will even feature a native dark mode.</p>
      <p>Ever since Google rolled out Android 10, dark mode support is a must-have feature on any app. And while Google itself has released dark themes for most of its apps, third-party developers are lagging far behind. Even popular apps like <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whatsapp-dark-mode-force-enable-developer-options/">still haven’t received</a> a dark theme yet, so it’s great to see dark mode support on the upcoming GitHub apps. As of now, the GitHub app is only available for iOS users in beta. If you’re on Android, you can join the waitlist by following <a href="https://github.com/mobile/beta?platforms=android">this link</a> and you’ll receive a notification whenever the app is available for download.</p>
      <p>Along with the new mobile app, GitHub made a number of announcements at the recent event. These include new streamlined notifications, better code navigation, a code search tool, code review assignments, scheduled reminders, and more. Follow the link below for a more detailed overview of everything new coming to GitHub.</p>
