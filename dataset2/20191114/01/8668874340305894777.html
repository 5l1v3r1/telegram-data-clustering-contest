      <h1>Warren Gatland explains why he said England had already played their final against the All Blacks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:59:37+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:59</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Departing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach Warren Gatland has opened up on everything from the decision to drop Brian O’Driscoll from the 2013 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> decider, his time coaching Wales, the Lions in 2021 and how the media has played a part in his career in a candid sit down interview with <i>Off the Ball</i> to promote his new book <i>Pride and Passion.</i></p>
      <p>Gatland explained in-depth his recent comments about <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> having already played their ‘final’ against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a>, drawing on his previous experience where he had seen first hand how powerful an emotionally charged performance can be.</p>

      <p>“At the very elite level of sport, it is the emotion that counts. And sometimes when you have a great performance and you are emotionally charged right on the edge, it is difficult to repeat that,” he told <i>Off the Ball</i>.</p>
      <p>“When I look back at my time coaching, there are two examples that really strike out for me.</p>
      <p>“One was in London coaching Wasps, and we played <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> in the last round. Martin Johnson’s last game and Neil Back’s last game at Welford Road. I completely underestimated the emotion of that.”</p>
      <p>“They beat us 45-24 or something like that. Then in the final, I didn’t think they could bring the same level of emotion so we put 40-points on them in the final.</p>
      <p>“It was the same scenario with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> in the second test in 2013. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/james-horwill/">James Horwill</a>, tears running down his eyes, the effort and energy they put into that, I didn’t think they could bring the same the following week.</p>
      <p>Gatland talked about his decision to drop Brian O’Driscoll for that decisive third test in that series, explaining how putting up O’Driscoll for media duties early in the week was a ‘mistake’.</p>
      <p>“The biggest mistake we made was on the Sunday after the second test we put Brian up for media.</p>
      <p>“That was a huge mistake because everyone just assumed with Sam Warburton getting injured that Brian was going to play and going to be captain the following week.</p>
      <p>“So we made the decision and I said to the other coaches ‘there could be a big falling out over this’. I didn’t realise quite the extent.</p>
      <p>The blowback brought Gatland to shed a tear following the series win, where he drank a solitary beer inside the changing rooms while the team celebrated on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“One of the hardest things as a coach, sometimes you have got to make, what you believe is the right calls and the tough calls. I could have made a soft decision, and the soft decision would have been to put Brian on the bench.</p>
