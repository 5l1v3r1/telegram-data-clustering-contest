      <p>BROADCASTER Piers Morgan has told Co Tyrone drugs mule Michaella McCollum to "stop whining" and give money from her book sales to anti-drug charities.</p>
      <p>Ms McCollum said she did not expect to make more than £2,000 from her memoir about her time in a Peruvian jail for drugs smuggling and she hoped others would learn from her mistake.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-two appeared on Good Morning Britain yesterday to publicise her book You'll Never See Daylight Again.</p>
      <p>She claimed the media had portrayed her in an "un-nice" manner and her private life should not have been reported on during her trial and conviction.</p>
      <p>Mr Morgan questioned how she thought the media should have portrayed her.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how to break this to you but when you are a £1.5 million cocaine smuggler that is not very nice. Do you know the damage that does?" he said.</p>
      <p>The former Mirror editor said her book should act as a "force for a good message" without the "whining and profiteering" and advised her to give the money from the book sales to charity.</p>
      <p>"You got the coverage you deserved," he added.</p>
      <p>Ms McCollum, from Dungannon, was one half of what became known as the 'Peru Two' - two young women who were caught smuggling cocaine worth £1.5m from a Peru airport in 2013.</p>
      <p>She and Scottish accomplice Melissa Reid served time in jail in Lima following their conviction for attempting to smuggle 11kg of cocaine to Spain.</p>
      <p>Ms McCollum was released in 2016.</p>
      <p>She said she was offered £5,000 to transport the drugs after she was approached at a party.</p>
      <p>"I didn't think much about.. I was 20 so I did know a bit," she said.</p>
      <p>"I just wasn't thinking... I look back now and think 'how could I not have realised what I was doing?'.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know I was going to Peru, I didn't know how much drugs it was... I wasn't really told much about anything."</p>
