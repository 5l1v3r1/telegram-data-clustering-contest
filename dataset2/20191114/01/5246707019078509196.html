      <p>After announcing a 20th December release date for season one <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/10/netflixs_the_witcher_series_secures_december_release_date_new_trailer_revealed">earlier this month</a>, Netflix has now confirmed its upcoming live-action adaptation of <i>The Witcher</i> will receive a second season.</p>
      <p>This announcement was made by the showrunner Lauren Hissrich, who took to Twitter yesterday to share the good news:</p>
      <blockquote>Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri will be back for more adventures... in Season Two.</blockquote>
      <p>The second season will <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-witcher-renewed-season-2-netflix-1203403503/">reportedly</a> be comprised of eight episodes and is targeting a 2021 release date.</p>
      <p>It wouldn't be the first time Netflix has jumped the gun like this, with its <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania_iii_draculas_curse">Castlevania</a></b> series being <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/06/netflix_has_already_renewed_castlevania_for_a_third_season_says_belmont_voice_actor">renewed</a> for a third season before the second one had even been aired.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, that unlike Castlevania series which was based on the popular video games of the same name, The Witcher Netflix adaptation draws on Andrzej Sapkowski's best-selling fantasy novels, rather than <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></b>, or any of CD Projekt Red's previous games.</p>
