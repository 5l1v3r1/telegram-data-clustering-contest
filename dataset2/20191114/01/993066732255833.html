      <p>Although the looming crisis over welfare reform support payments has been well flagged up, the reality is that time is running out to resolve something that could be seriously detrimental for many people.</p>
      <p>As part of the Stormont House Agreement, a £500 million package of mitigation measures was introduced in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The aim was to lessen some of the impact of welfare reform, an issue that almost brought down the power-sharing executive in 2015.</p>
      <p>The problem is that the package of support payments is due to run out in March 2020 unless a minister steps in to sign an extension.</p>
      <p>In June this year, a joint sitting of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee and the Work and Pensions Committee heard dire warnings from experts and organisations about the likely repercussions if the current level of support is not extended.</p>
      <p>In particular, there was concern that the payments are due to end at the same time as a wider roll out of Universal Credit.</p>
      <p>Five months on and there is no sign that the Stormont government is about to get back to work which leaves families and individuals anxious about what the future holds.</p>
      <p>The latest warning about the implications of a sudden stop to the mitigation package has been sounded in relation to 'social supermarkets', which allow people on welfare payments and tax credits to buy food at cut prices.</p>
      <p>Unlike official food banks, people can use the service week after week, for as long as they need it.</p>
      <p>The Department for Communities provides around £70,000 for each of five shops run by community organisations in Belfast, Derry, Coleraine, Lisburn and Strabane.</p>
      <p>These shops not only provide food but also valuable support and advice to those on low incomes, helping to improve their budgeting and cooking skills among other things.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that it is an absolute indictment that in this day and age people are being forced to rely on food banks and social supermarkets in order to feed themselves and their families.</p>
      <p>What is deeply worrying is that those who are already experiencing food poverty could find themselves even worse off if the mitigation measures are not extended.</p>
      <p>The focus of this election is on Brexit but for many people their concerns are about matters that are much more fundamental.</p>
