      <p>TOKYO (Nov 14): Oil prices rose on Thursday, extending gains from the previous session, as an industry report showing a fall in U.S. crude stockpiles last week added to positive comments by the U.S. Federal Reserve head on the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 20 cents, or 0.4%, at $57.32 a barrel by 0111 GMT, after rising 0.6% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Brent futures were up 17 cents, or 0.3% at $62.54 a barrel, having risen 0.5% in the previous session.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. economy would see a "sustained expansion" with the full impact of recent interest rate cuts still to be felt, boosting hopes for increased demand for crude.</p>
      <p>Powell's "rosy view of the U.S. economy reinforces the view that the Fed sees the economy is on a positive track," said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiTrader.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude inventories fell by 541,000 barrels in the week to Nov. 8 to 440 million, data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, showed on Wednesday, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 1.6 million barrels.</p>
      <p>Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due at 11:00 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Thursday. Both reports were delayed a day for the U.S. Veterans Day holiday on Monday.</p>
      <p>Concerns have eased over a U.S. recession, although an economic rebound is also not expected any time soon, according to a Reuters poll of economists released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The poll also showed that economists believe the U.S.-China trade war is unlikely to see a permanent truce over the coming year, which may further impact global growth and demand for oil, putting a cap on prices.</p>
      <p>Still, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said global economic fundamentals remained strong and that he remained confident the United States and China would reach a trade deal.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia - grouping known as OPEC+ - have been restraining production since January to try support oil prices. - Reuters</p>
