      <p>SYDNEY, Nov 14 — A Grigor Dimitrov-led Bulgaria was among the final six teams announced today for the ATP Cup in Australia — the new world tennis team event.</p>
      <p>Chile, Poland, Uruguay, Moldova and Norway were the other countries to make the grade, based on the ranking of their number one singles player at the second entry deadline of November 13.</p>
      <p>The rest of the 24-nation field was announced in September, although Switzerland later pulled out after Roger Federer opted to skip the tournament.</p>
      <p>The field will be split into six groups across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.</p>
      <p>As the highest-qualifying country at the second deadline, Bulgaria replace the Swiss and join Belgium and the Andy Murray-led Great Britain in Group C in Sydney.</p>
      <p>The championship takes place from January 3-12 in the lead-up to the year’s first Grand Slam, the Australian Open in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>World number one Novak Djokovic will begin his 2020 season representing Serbia with Dusan Lajovic in Brisbane, against France, South Africa and Chile.</p>
      <p>Spain’s Rafael Nadal will kick off his campaign in Perth alongside Roberto Bautista Agut facing Japan, Georgia and Uruguay.</p>
      <p>Eight teams — with up to five players each — will emerge from the round-robin stage to compete in the knockout phase in Sydney until one is left standing with ties comprising two singles and one doubles match.</p>
      <p>Most of the world’s top 30, minus Federer, are taking part. </p>
      <p>The new-look start to the year offers A$22 million (RM62.3 million) in prize money and a maximum of 750 singles and 250 doubles ATP rankings points.</p>
      <p>It will be held on the back of a revamped Davis Cup, run by the International Tennis Federation in November, bringing together 18 nations in one place for a week at the end of the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>ATP Cup draw:</p>
      <p>Group A (Brisbane) - Serbia, France, South Africa, Chile</p>
      <p>Group B (Perth) - Spain, Japan, Georgia, Uruguay</p>
      <p>Group C (Sydney) - Bulgaria, Belgium, Great Britain, Moldova</p>
      <p>Group D (Perth) - Russia, Italy, USA, Norway</p>
      <p>Group E (Sydney) - Austria, Croatia, Argentina, Poland</p>
      <p>Group F (Brisbane) - Germany, Greece, Canada, Australia — AFP</p>
