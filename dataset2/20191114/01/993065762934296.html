      <h1>Public raise £2,000 for Derry funeral of 'much-loved' homeless man Jimmy Brolly</h1>

      <p>MORE than £2,000 has been raised through an online appeal to cover the funeral costs of a man who spent his days on the streets of Derry city centre.</p>
      <p>While he lived in a hostel, Jimmy Brolly (59) was a familiar figure in the city centre and came to public prominence in 2015 when he accidentally caught fire close to Translink bus station.</p>
      <p>Following his death in hospital after a short illness, SDLP assembly member Mark H Durkan launched a JustGiving page to raise the money for his funeral today. It surpassed the £2,000 required within hours.</p>
      <p>Mr Durkan thanked people for their generosity and said Mr Brolly, originally from Co Derry, was a “much-loved Derry character”.</p>
      <p>“The affection that this city had for Jimmy has been palpable since his passing. The outpouring of sadness and stories around social media are testament to the place he held in the hearts of people here," he said.</p>

      <p>“Many of us will have experienced the warmth of Jimmy’s personality as, despite his own difficulties, he always strived – and usually succeeded – to make other people smile.”</p>
      <p>Mr Brolly will be buried at Derry city cemetery following Requiem Mass this morning at St Mary’s Church, Creggan.</p>
