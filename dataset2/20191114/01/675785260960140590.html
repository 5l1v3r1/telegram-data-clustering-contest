      <h1>Help us plant one million trees with Mirror's campaign to restore our forests</h1>
      <h2>Working with the Woodland Trust, we are giving away 20,000 native trees – two each to 10,000 readers – for you to plant at home or in your community as part of the Daily Mirror's MillionMirrorTrees campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T01:01:08+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 01:01</time> by <a rel="author">Nada Farhoud, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nada-farhoud/</a></address>
      <p>Right now we are facing the gravest ever threat to modern life on Earth and scientists are clear that urgent action is needed.</p>
      <p>What we do now will shape the future of our planet for generations to come.</p>
      <p>All of us can make a difference in the fight against climate change and today we are helping you do just that.</p>
      <p>Working with the Woodland Trust, we are giving away 20,000 native trees – two each to 10,000 readers – for you to plant at home or in your community.</p>
      <p>It marks the beginning of a brilliant new MillionMirrorTrees campaign, which we are working on with A Trillion Trees, a joint venture of the world’s largest conservation charities – WWF, BirdLife International and Wildlife Conservation Society who are together fighting deforestation and to restore forests around the world.</p>

      <p>Ben Fogle joined in by planting a mountain ash at Queen Katherine School in Kendal, Cumbria yesterday, with Paul Crossland from Hayes Garden World, Ambleside who supplied the tree.</p>
      <p>The campaign is poignant for the TV star who fears precious regions he has visited, such as Antarctica, may “become extinct geographies in my children’s lifetimes”. He said: “Anyone can plant a tree.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t have to cost anything. This is why I back the Mirror’s campaign.”</p>
      <p>Our aim is to plant at least one million trees over five years, and help protect the ones we have. But this is just a start.</p>
      <p>Today just 13% of the UK is covered in trees, compared to the EU average of 37%. Globally 10 billion more are cut down than are planted every year.</p>

      <p>According to the Committee on Climate Change, the Government’s statutory advisers on the climate crisis, the UK should have 1.5billion new trees by 2050 to meet its net zero carbon target.</p>
      <p>But last year just 1,420 hectares of its 5,000-hectare yearly target were planted.</p>
      <p>Daily Mirror editor Alison Phillips urged readers to “make a difference”.</p>
      <p>She said: “It can feel the climate crisis is so extreme there is nothing normal people at home, like us, can do about it.</p>
      <p>“But planting a tree will have some impact. And raising the issue of climate crisis in your community is invaluable.”</p>
      <p>Darren Moorcroft, head of the Woodland Trust which is holding a national planting day on November 30, said trees were “warriors” against climate change.</p>
      <p>“We hope Mirror readers apply for trees and dig for all our futures,” he said.</p>
