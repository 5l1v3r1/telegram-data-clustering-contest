      <h1>Nikki Haley slams Democrats over Trump impeachment inquiry: 'Let the people decide' next year</h1>

      <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/nikki-haley-ukraine-biden-trump-investigation-hannity">Nikki Haley</a> advised Democrats Wednesday to let America's voters decide on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> future in the White House rather than <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">pursuing impeachment</a>.</p>
      <p>Haley said on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">The Story</a>" that the American people would rather see substantive legislation on more pressing issues like trade, illegal immigration and the federal budget.</p>
      <p>"The bottom line is, I think this is a distraction from what the American people really care about," she said. "They want to see jobs, the economy -- all of those things focused on and the U.S.-Mexico-Canadian trade agreement [USMCA] needs to get done. The country's being divided on illegal immigration -- they need to get in there and debate that.</p>

      <p>"The thing that bothers me about the impeachment is we're less than a year away from an election," Haley added. "Let the people decide."</p>
      <p>Haley characterized the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the centerpiece of impeachment proceedings as a regular conversation between two heads of state.</p>
      <p>She said it is "not a secret" that Trump asked about the Kiev government potentially investigating the Bidens, but added that Trump continues to deny any threat was made to Ukraine, including in regard to withholding aid.</p>
      <p>The former South Carolina governor added that the president appears to rightfully be resentful of how he has been treated by Congress.</p>
      <p>"He's been in one investigation after another, yet the other side has not been investigated, and I think it just kind of burns him a bit," she said.</p>
      <p>In addition, Haley responded to repeated rumors she could supplant Vice President Mike Pence on Trump's 2020 reelection ticket.</p>

      <p>Responding specifically to Steve Schmidt -- a campaign strategist and MSNBC pundit who has worked for the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- Haley said a running mate switch is "not gonna happen and accused Schmidt and others of trying to "create excuses" for the fact she is a woman with a good working relationship with Trump.</p>
      <p>Haley said Pence, a former Indiana governor and U.S. congressman, has done good work and that he and the president are "strong together."</p>
      <p>On MSNBC, Schmidt claimed Trump wants to "dump" Pence in favor of Haley, and said that there is an "overwhelming chance" that comes to fruition.</p>
      <p>"[Trump] has an enormous problem with women -- suburban women particularly," he said.</p>
