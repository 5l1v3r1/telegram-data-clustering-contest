      <p>Lune Rouge, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/canada">Montreal-based company</a> headed by Laliberte, confirmed his detention. It said Laliberte is being questioned about cannabis reportedly grown for personal use on his private island of Nukutepipi.</p>
      <p>The company said Laliberte is a medical marijuana user, but he “categorically denies” involvement in the sale or trafficking of controlled substances.</p>
