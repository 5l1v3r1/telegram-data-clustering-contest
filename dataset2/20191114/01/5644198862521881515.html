      <p>REUTERS: Walt Disney Co on Wednesday said its new streaming service, Disney+, has reached 10 million sign-ups since launching on Nov. 12, sending shares up 3.5per cent to US$143.53 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

      <p>The service, which launched in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands, was hit with technical glitches that the company said were caused by higher-than-expected demand as it takes on rival Netflix Inc.</p>
      <p>Netflix currently has over 60 million subscribers in the United States and 158 million globally.</p>
      <p>Disney+ costs US$7 per month and features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the companyâ€™s deep family entertainment catalog as well as new programming.</p>
      <p>Disney said moving forward, it has no plans to release Disney+ subscriber data outside of the company's quarterly earnings calls.</p>
