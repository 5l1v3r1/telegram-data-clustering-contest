      <p>Delhi and places nearby were engulfed in a smog on Thursday as air pollution reached emergency levels, prompting authorities to shut schools and warn that a traffic rationing measure could be extended.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-air-quality-index">Air quality index </a>(AQI) in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>was 472 with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels at 322 and PM 10 levels at 487 at 6:30 am on Thursday.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'. An AQI above 500 falls in the 'severe plus' category.Particulate matter is the sum of all solid and liquid particles suspended in air many of which are hazardous, according to the Greenfacts.org website.</p>
      <p>The pollution has prompted the authorities to order closure of schools till November 15 -- a second time in two weeks.</p>
      <p>With the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) fearing a similar situation will prevail over the next two days, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the odd-even road rationing scheme can be extended if needed.</p>

      <p>The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) also extended the restrictions on dirty-fuel based industries in Delhi-NCR, hot mix plants and stone crushers till the morning of November 15, as the MeT department said strong winds are expected from Friday, which will bring down the air pollution levels to the very poor category.</p>
      <p>According to weather experts, a fall in the temperature and wind speed led to the accumulation of pollutants. The problems were compounded by a cloud cover that blocked sunlight.</p>
      <p>According to the government's air quality monitor SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution was 22 per cent on Wednesday. It was 25 per cent on Tuesday.</p>
