      <p>NIALL Tóibín was last night remembered as a great actor and wit who "blazed a trail".</p>
      <p>The 89-year-old star of stage, television and film died in Dublin early yesterday following a long illness.</p>
      <p>Born in Cork into an Irish-speaking family, Tóibín began his career in radio before screen roles in Ryan's Daughter, Veronica Guerin, The Irish RM and as Fr MacAnally in hit BBC series Ballykissangel.</p>
      <p>On stage, he won acclaim for playing Brendan Behan in Borstal Boy both in the Abbey Theatre and on Broadway and in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot at the National Theatre, London.</p>
      <p>In 1992, the father-of-five appeared alongside Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the film Far and Away.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Cork native had a role in the short film Remains.</p>
      <p>He was given a lifetime achievement award from the Irish Film and Television Academy in 2011. Four years later, he was awarded the freedom of Cork.</p>
      <p>The actor was predeceased by his wife Judy in 2002 and is survived by his children Sean, Muireann, Aisling, Sighle and Fiana.</p>
      <p>President Michael D Higgins said his contribution to Irish theatre "was a unique one, in both Irish and English".</p>
      <p>"The depth of interpretation that he brought to a wide variety of characters showed a very deep intellectual understanding and, above all, sensitivity to the nuance of Irish life," he said.</p>
      <p>"The range of his work was vast and included unforgettable performances in all of the Irish theatres and some of the most important theatres in London and New York.</p>
      <p>"While a huge audience will have adored his comic genius, his work included all the genres – stage, television, film and radio. To the latter he brought a distinctive voice which made him a much-loved interpreter of Irish life and its challenges."</p>
      <p>Mr Higgins added: "Sabina and I send our deepest condolences to his children Sighle, Aisling, Fiana, Sean and Muireann and the other members of his family, and to all those who so loved his work".</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Mr Toíbín had "blazed a trail".</p>
      <p>"Proud Corkman, loved across Ireland &amp; further afield," he tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Performance as Brendan Behan in Borstal Boy &amp; radio, TV &amp; film appearances will be long remembered. Great actor &amp; wit. Rest in peace."</p>
      <p>Dee Forbes, Director-General of RTÉ, said: "Niall Tóibín started acting in the 1950s and spent 14 great years with the Radio Éireann Players.</p>
      <p>"He became, ultimately, a familiar face on RTÉ to generations of Irish people. A proud Corkman, he was as at home in film as on the stage, and an especially entertaining guest on many Late Late Shows over the years."</p>
      <p>RTÉ presenter Joe Duffy also said the Ballykissangel star was "always friendly, an extraordinarily gifted actor, comedian and writer".</p>
      <p>"No one could interpret the work and life of Brendan Behan more accurately," he said.</p>
