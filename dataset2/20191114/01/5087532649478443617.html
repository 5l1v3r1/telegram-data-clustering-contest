      <p><a href="https://www.projectwizards.net/en">Merlin</a> turned 15 years old this month, and to celebrate <a href="https://www.projectwizards.net/en">ProjectWizards</a> released version 6, an update that adds support for Dark Mode. The company is also including a Light Mode interface, and four different ways of mixing the two by allowing project contents to take on either mode, while the interface itself can also take on both modes.</p>
