      <p>EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (WABC) -- There is a new incentive to get shoppers into the new <a href="https://abc7ny.com/shopping/american-dream-mall-opens-in-nj-along-with-theme-park/5645977/">American Dream mall </a>in New Jersey - parking is now free.</p>
      <p>The mall initially listed a range of parking rates between $3 for 30 minutes all the way up to $24 for 8 hours.</p>
      <p>American Dream was supposed to start collecting the fees October 28, a week after opening weekend. But apparently officials have had a change of heart.</p>
      <p>However, drivers do have to pay a $10 valet charge and event rate parking of $30 on days when there is an NFL game at MetLife Stadium.</p>
      <p>American Dream confirmed that the paid parking rates have not been enforced since the mall's opening.</p>
