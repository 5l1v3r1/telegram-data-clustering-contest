      <p>Today's <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/google-assistant-interaction-stadia-day-one.html">Stadia</a> AMA just keeps on giving, as Beri Lee notes you can use Google Play gift cards for game purchases.</p>
      <p>It doesn't stop there though. You'll <i>also </i>be able to use Google Play Credits for those same game purchases. Yes, the very same Google Play Credits that you can earn through the Rewards app.</p>
      <p>If you're unfamiliar with Rewards, it's an app that Google launched years ago. It lets you answer surveys in exchange for a small amount of credits that can be added to our Play account.</p>

      <p>Anyone who is looking to purchase <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/google-officially-confirms-the-stadia-controller-phone-mount.html">Stadia</a> will definitely want to start using Rewards as soon as possible.</p>
      <h3>Google Play credits &amp; gift cards can only be used in the Stadia app</h3>
      <p>If there is one caveat that is currently known about this new piece of information, it's where you buy the games.</p>
      <p>Game purchases <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dvv3tv/hi_reddit_andrey_from_the_stadia_team_here_and_im/f7f8d33/?context=3">can be made</a> in the Stadia app on Android. And it's here that you'll be able to use your Google Play credits and gift cards to buy games. This means you cannot use the iOS app to make purchases. Namely because iOS doesn't have the Play Store.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>You may eventually able to buy games on the official Stadia website. If that time comes, you won't be able to use Google Play credits or gift cards for those purchases.</p>
      <p>What that boils down to is, use the Rewards app as much as you can. And, buy all your Stadia games through the app and not elsewhere if there ends up being other options later on.</p>
      <h3>Play Credits expire after a while, so use them quick</h3>
      <p>Saving up to buy a game? Don't wait too long. Google Play Credits expire after a year from the time of issue. This means if you have some credits you acquired in February of 2019, they'll expire the same time next year.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Basically, don't sit on your Play Credits until you have enough to buy a full game. For one, it would probably take many months to rack up that much. Beyond that, you risk losing some of those credits if you don't use them fast enough.</p>
      <p>This is likely to be more useful for gift card holders. But, it's also a nice little perk for those with Google Play Credits. If you have $5, $10, or even $20 sitting in your Google Play account, use it to lower the price of a game you were looking to pick up.</p>
      <p>This way you can still use those credits and you simply spend less of your own money. Of course if your resolve is strong and your patience thick, by all means save up until you have enough to grab any game you had your eye on. Until you approach one year of course.</p>
