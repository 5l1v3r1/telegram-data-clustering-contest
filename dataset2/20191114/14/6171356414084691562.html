      <h1>Verizon's revolutionary new Moto Razr doesn't even work on its 5G network</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:00:12+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>Motorola finally announced the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/13/the-foldable-moto-razr-is-official-coming-exclusively-to-verizon-on-january-9th-for-1500/">long-rumored Moto Razr yesterday</a>, and it's going to be launched exclusively on Verizon in January 2020. While the company positions the device as revolutionary and cutting-edge, there's one thing in it that certainly isn't that: Its antennas can't receive Verizon's mmWave 5G transmissions.</p>
      <p>Judging from the <a href="https://fccid.io/IHDT56XM1">FCC's documents</a>, the innovative new phone's certified cell frequencies top out at 2.5GHz, which means it doesn't support Verizon's mmWave network. To be fair, it probably would've been challenging to fit a large 5G antenna array and modem into this novel smartphone form factor, especially considering that this would've required a different processor that supports Qualcomm's 5G modem in the first place.</p>
      <p>Battery life could've also been a problem â€” 5G antennas are pretty thirsty for power at the current stage of development, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1194658207110778881?s=19">two small batteries</a> with a total of 2510mAh would probably suffer greatly. You won't be grateful for the speed gains when your device runs out of power after an hour of usage.</p>
      <p>It's still dissonant to launch a phone with supposedly cutting-edge technology that doesn't support the standard your exclusive launch partner has been advertising all of 2019. Maybe <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/30/the-moto-z2-force-will-get-5g-moto-mod-support-this-summer/">a flexible 5G Moto Mod</a> could be the solution later on?</p>
