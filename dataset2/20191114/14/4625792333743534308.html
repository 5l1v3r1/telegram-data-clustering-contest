      <h1>'I’m embarrassed for you': Kellyanne Conway steams after clip of husband’s MSNBC commentary played</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:54:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>CNN host Wolf Blitzer pressed <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/powerful-woman-kellyanne-conway-mocks-and-threatens-reporter-for-mentioning-her-husband-audio">Kellyanne Conway</a> to respond to her husband, George Conway’s MSNBC commentary on the impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>George Conway <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-dont-frankly-want-to-be-on-television-george-conway-makes-rare-tv-appearance-for-impeachment-hearings"><u>joined MSNBC’s coverage</u></a> of the House impeachment hearings on Tuesday, despite saying that he does not want to be on television. Conway has been one of President Trump’s loudest critics for the past few years.</p>
      <p>During an interview on Thursday morning, Blitzer asked Kellyanne Conway to respond to her husband’s commentary, including his opinion that Trump had used his office to “advance his own personal interest as opposed to the country’s.”</p>
      <p>Blitzer’s line of questioning derailed immediately when he said, “I don’t want to talk about your marriage. I know that there are issues there.”</p>
      <p>Conway defended her marriage, asking Blitzer, “Did you just say there are issues there?” Blitzer backtracked and asked that she respond to his commentary. Conway asked why her husband’s commentary was relevant.</p>
      <p>“He’s a legal scholar, he’s a lawyer, and he was really going after the president of the United States,” Blitzer explained. Conway pushed back, asking, “And the relevance is? Wait for it. Drumroll. And he’s married to me?”</p>

      <p>Blitzer finally rolled the MSNBC clip, but Conway brushed it off, saying, “And that is his opinion.” She said Blitzer “embarrassed” himself by asking about her husband and only did it for ratings.</p>
      <p>“You wanted to put it in my husband’s voice because you think somehow that that will help your ratings or that you’re really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway. And let me be very clear. You didn’t stick it to Kellyanne Conway,” she said. “I think you embarrassed yourself, and I’m embarrassed for you.”</p>
      <p>Conway has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/transcript-of-telephone-call-between-kellyanne-conway-and-caitlin-yilek"><u>opposed reporting on her marriage</u></a> in the past. She claimed that her husband gets his power from her, “Not the other way around.”</p>
