      <p>Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano on Thursday’s “Fox &amp; Friends” reacted to the first day of the impeachment inquiry hearings the day before.</p>
      <p>Napolitano said the hearsay testimony from diplomat Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent did not change anyone’s minds like it is supposed to.</p>
      <p>“The purpose of yesterday is to change people’s minds,” Napolitano explained. “I don’t think it changed people’s minds. I mean, I watched it all day like everybody else did. I’ve already said in my opinion, the law is not on the president’s side.”</p>
      <p>The New Jersey Superior Court judge advised that the impeachment hearings are “political” rather than “juridical,” meaning hearsay can be “as valid and politically potent as direct testimony.”</p>
