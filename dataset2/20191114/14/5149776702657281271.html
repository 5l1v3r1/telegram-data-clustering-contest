      <h2>Well, this is a bit different... oh yes it is!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:58:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>All the gags, glamour and festive fun of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/theatre">Nottingham's Sleeping Beauty</a> pantomime will be available to watch without leaving the sofa.</p>
      <p>For the first time, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-playhouse">Playhouse</a> will be screening its panto online and 'on demand'.</p>
      <p>Nursing homes, schools and hospital wards across Nottinghamshire and beyond are being encouraged to sign up to these special showings, designed for those who are unable to visit the theatre in person.</p>
      <p>Access to the performance is available through an application process at <a href="https://www.nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/participation/community/panto-on-demand/">nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/panto-on-demand</a>, the deadline is Sunday, November 24.</p>
      <p>Successful applicants will be given an exclusive online link to view the production – with the Playhouse offering technical support and the option of one of the theatre’s ushers to attend on the day.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that this will bring a quintessential, festive experience to people who are unable or too ill to travel.</p>

      <p>Rebecca Hogarth, community engagement manager at Nottingham Playhouse, says: “At Nottingham Playhouse, we are passionate about making theatre accessible for as many people as possible.</p>
      <p>"We already provide audio-described, British Sign Language interpreted, dementia-friendly and relaxed performances – but this year we wanted to go one step further.</p>
      <p>“We are encouraging groups from across the UK to sign up to a streaming of Sleeping Beauty – so that people who wouldn't otherwise be able to, can see the pantomime. The application is just a short questionnaire, and we can’t wait to bring Princess Rosalind, Prince Alexander and Jerry the Jester to more people.”</p>
      <p>Sleeping Beauty - directed by Kenneth Alan Taylor - tells the story of Princess Rosalind, who pricks her finger on evil fairy Maleficent’s spinning wheel and is sent into a deep sleep along with the rest of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>It’s then up to the brave Prince Alexander, Jerry the Jester and Fairy Wisheart to foil the evil fairy’s plans and save Sleeping Beauty.</p>
      <p>It runs from Friday, November 22 to Saturday, January 11. More details at nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk.</p>
