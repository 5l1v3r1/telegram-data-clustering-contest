      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Musician Liz Phair discussed on <i>Late Night with <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Seth_Meyers/?tps=1">Seth Meyers</a></i> how her new memoir is very personal and honest about her life.</p>
      <p>"It was scary. It was a lot to put out there," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ndDc0wqx4w">the singer said</a> on Wednesday about penning <i>Horror Stories: A Memoir, </i>which was released in October.</p>
      <p>"The memoir is very revealing in certain ways," she continued. "I expose a lot of my personal life on the page."</p>
      <p>"I was challenged by a couple people in my life, to do something like what I did when I first started making music. To be as honest and be as vulnerable as that," Phair said.</p>
      <p>Phair also mentioned how she wrote the memoir never thinking that her mother would read it until a friend gave her a copy of the book at the grocery store.</p>
