      <p>NEW YORK -- In an ABC News exclusive, Teresa Giudice is talking for the first time about reuniting overseas with her husband Joe, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/entertainment/rhonj-star-joe-giudice-can-be-in-italy-as-he-fights-deportation/5597575/">who was deported</a>.<br/><br/>The "Real Housewives of New Jersey" star spoke with Paula Faris for Thursday morning's edition of "Good Morning America."<br/><br/>"Is he at peace, does Joe seem like he's at peace?" Paula asked.<br/><br/>"He said he cried, after we left he cried the whole day, he said," she said. "Just missing his daughters. He said he was so sad."<br/><br/>The couple has four daughters, and they vacationed together in Italy.<br/><br/>Though Joe Giudice opposes his deportation, he asked a court to allow him to relocate to Italy during the fight.<br/><br/>The couple pleaded guilty in 2014 to financial fraud, and Teresa Giudice served her sentence first and was released in December 2015.<br/><br/>Joe Giudice has been held by immigration officials since he completed his 41-month prison term. A judge ruled that he would be deported upon completion of his sentence.<br/><br/>Giudice has said he came to the U.S. as an infant and wasn't aware he wasn't an American citizen.<br/><br/>As for their relationship, Teresa said it's "to be determined." She added that they're taking it day by day.<br/><br/>She told Faris that she and Joe only want the best for each other.</p>
