      <p>For the hack to work, the sinister software has to be installed on a person’s PC or laptop. It can then be used to launch the webcam, record footage and send it over to a ‘criminal server’.</p>
      <p>The hackers will then use the videos to blackmail those affected, threatening to send it to a person’s family.</p>

      <p>The software known as ‘PsiXBot’ can often be loaded to a computer without a person’s knowledge, and may be installed through a person using less reputable websites or by downloading infected videos, music files or software. Only computers running Microsoft Windows are thought to be affected.</p>
      <p>Once installed, PsiXBot sits in the background of a computer waiting for a web browser page title containing a specific porn related keyword. Once the page is opened, the filming will begin, German publication <i><a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/digital/internet/internet/experten-warnen-schadsoftware-filmt-internetnutzer-beim-porno-gucken-65962996,view=conversionToLogin.bild.html#remId=1642275711371492031">Bild</a> </i>reports<i>.</i></p>
      <p>Users may be made aware of the situation after receiving an email containing words such as ‘can publish everything’, ‘dirty video of you’, ‘I recorded you’ and ‘pervert’.</p>
      <p>Hackers will threaten to send footage to a person’s family if they don’t pay up, often requesting money in the form of untraceable Bitcoin.</p>

      <p>Hackers threatening to sending videos of a person watching an porn is referred to as ‘sextortion’ and has been around for quite a while. However, the hackers’ ability to capture actual footage is a relatively recent development.</p>
      <p>Prior to the launch of the new PornModule, hackers would claim they had videos of the user, however such footage rarely actually existed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Software expert Werner Thalmeier, from security firm Proofpoint, said:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <blockquote>PsiXBot has been around for several years but a new module has been added that allows hackers to capture video.<br/><br/>[…] Now the threat is real and the program has already been distributed thousands of times.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Mr Thalmeier added:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>This software is a semi-professional tool and much more dangerous than, say, attacks with manipulated e-mails, because the hidden program on the computer can hardly be found with a virus scanner.</blockquote>

      <p>Proofpoint advises those who receive such emails to perform a full virus scan on their machine. This could reportedly take hours to run, depending on the hard drive capacity.</p>
      <p>However, a computer expert from another security company has noted hackers who claim to have your details can often be bluffing.</p>
      <p>Paul Ducklin, computer security expert at Sophos, has claimed almost all cases turn out to false, the <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7684711/Hackers-able-capture-video-people-using-porn-websites.html">MailOnline</a> </i>reports.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Ducklin, opportunistic extortionists will often convince a person they have gained webcam access by giving private information that has actually just been gained through a data breach and leak.</p>
