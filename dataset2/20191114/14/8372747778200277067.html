      <p>FRANKFORT, Ky. â€” On Thursday, <a href="https://www.lex18.com/breaking-news-alerts/gov-bevin-concedes-election-following-recanvass">Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin conceded the election</a> nine days after losing to Governor-elect Andy Beshear.</p>
      <p>The governor formally requested a recanvass following his loss to Attorney General Andy Beshear. On election night he refused to concede, saying that he believed there had been "voting irregularities."</p>
      <p>"This is a close, close race. We are not conceding this race by any stretch," he declared on election night.</p>
      <p>The challenge to the results did not deter Beshear, who named his transition team the day after the election.</p>
      <p>Bevin told the media that he wishes Beshear the best and stated that his team was working with the Attorney General to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes and Secretary of State-elect Michael Adams tallied recanvass results from 120 county clerks.</p>
