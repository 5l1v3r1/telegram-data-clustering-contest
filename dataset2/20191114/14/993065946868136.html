      <p>Three cows presumed dead after being swept out to sea by Hurricane Dorian have been found on North Carolina’s Outer Banks having apparently swum several miles to safety.</p>
      <p>The intrepid bovines were part of a herd living on the sands of Cedar Island when the storm struck in September, creating what has been described as a “mini tsunami” that swept scores of animals – including 28 wild horses – into the ocean.</p>
      <p>Over the past few weeks, staff working for the Cape Lookout National Seashore park service have spotted three of the missing cows on the Outer Banks, a series of barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina.</p>

      <p>It appears the cows were propelled on to the banks by the surging water being pushed back out to sea by shifting winds after the hurricane flooded local rivers and bays.</p>
      <p>“I’ll say it’s about four miles across Core Sound,” Cape Lookout spokesman BG Horvat told the Charlotte Observer.</p>
      <p>“Remember, the cows and all the horses were swept away with the water surging back. Who knows exactly, but the (cows) certainly have a gripping story to share.”</p>
      <p>According to local reports, around 30 cows roamed freely on private land on Cedar Island before the hurricane struck, but most are thought to have perished in the storm.</p>
      <p>A plan is now being formulated to get the animals back to the island.</p>

      <p>Cows are known to be relatively strong swimmers.</p>
      <p>Last year the National Trust published footage of livestock swimming across part of Lough Erne in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>But while journeys like that one of 100 metres or so are relatively routine, it is less common to see them traversing distances of several miles.</p>
