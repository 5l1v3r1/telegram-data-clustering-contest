      <p>How often do we, as women, not speak up when someone is violating our personal space, in particular when a man is touching us and it is unwanted?</p>
      <p>Our experiences of violation can be horrific or seemingly insignificant which, in reality, seems to have little correlation to whether the psychological effects are severe or mild. Yet, all of our experiences share a common message about the nature of what it is to be a woman.</p>
      <p>At its core, it is about property rights – Do I own me? Do I have a full and unfettered property right to my own body? What does that actually look like?</p>
      <p>Faith Jones is an international corporate attorney and executive coach who capitalized on her unusual background to create her unique “I Own Me” framework which works to empower women in business and personal relationships. Her passion and focus is to inspire women to take back responsibility for their own lives, decisions, businesses, and bodies through education and by changing the societal systems and laws that have prejudiced them for centuries.</p>
      <p>Faith, who graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and with honors from UC Berkeley Law School, was named the Top 40 Under 40 M&amp;A Advisor in 2015. She began her career as an attorney with Skadden Arps where she represented clients in a wide variety of cross-border corporate transactions. After Skadden, Faith headed up Walton &amp; Walton LLP’s corporate practice where she represented varying clients from start-ups to Fortune 500s.</p>
      <p>Her multi-cultural background and wide variety of experience and interests adds to her ability to develop creative solutions for non-profit as well as for-profit companies across the globe. As a world traveler, she spent much of her early life in South East Asia and speaks Mandarin Chinese. She has worked with businesses and government leaders in the Pacific Rim and uses this insight to assist clients in understanding the unique opportunities available in Asia.</p>
      <p>She is the inventor of the Personal Air Filter device, a non-mask, wearable air filter for polluted areas, and she has experience as a humanitarian aid worker in Kazakhstan, Russia, Japan, and Taiwan. She is currently writing her Memoir with HarperCollins Publishers.</p>
      <p>This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.</p>
