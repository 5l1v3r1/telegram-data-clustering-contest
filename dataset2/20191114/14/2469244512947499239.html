      <h2>A possible two-storey cafe with a new coast watch tower above it could be built along the beach</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:07:03+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>The next stage of the redevelopment of Exmouth seafront has been revealed to the public which will include a new hotel, waterfront restaurant and free play facilities.</p>
      <p>The phase three proposals for Queen’s Drive, which include the Harbour View café site, are now on show at a public exhibition at the Ocean Suite.</p>
      <p>HemingwayDesign’s proposals, based on the Exmouth masterplan, the Exmouth Neighbourhood Plan, and the results of surveys carried out last summer, have described it as a mixed-use leisure space.</p>

      <p>The idea is for there to be an open area on the ground floor that people can pop into for food and drink with sandy feet and the likes and a more formal eating area on the first floor. The watch tower will then sit above that.</p>
      <p>The proposals include building three or four storey middle of the market hotel, with around 70 to 80 bedrooms, and car parking for all guests around the back.</p>

      <p>Next to hotel would be Exmouth Fun Park, a play and events space, possibly including crazy golf.</p>
      <p>The plans also include a large sandpit, splash play area, and seating areas.</p>
      <p>Exmouth residents, local businesses, clubs and groups are invited to Ocean in Exmouth today, November 14, from 5.30pm to 7.30pm to hear HemingwayDesign present the results of the consultation and public engagement work they carried out for Phase 3 of the Queen’s Drive site in Exmouth.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, progress is being made with Grenadier Estates’ new watersports centre on the phase two site, which is due to open in spring 2020.</p>
      <p>The entire site will be called Exmouth Commons and will be advertised to visitors as being 60 acres of fun and healthy play and relaxation space, often with free activities.</p>
      <p>The aim is for it to become known as a place for all ages with lots on offer including play spaces, multi-sports activities, gardens, cafes, picnic areas, watersport tuition, walking and running tracks and , of course, the sandy beach and sea.</p>
      <p>Wayne Hemingway said: “With the existing open space and sports facilities along with the pop up spaces and the upcoming water sports centre this site has the scale and content to 'unlock' a modern visitor offer for the town, while respecting the essential character of Exmouth.</p>
      <p>"The extensive public consultation informs the visioning work for the Queen’s Drive site. We are looking forward to the event on November 14 where the visioning work, which stems from the extensive public consultation, will be made available for public comment.”</p>
