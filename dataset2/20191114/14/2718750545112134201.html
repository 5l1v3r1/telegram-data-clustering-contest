      <h1>Kacey Musgraves Makes a ‘Rainbow Connection’ With Willie Nelson at the CMAs</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/kacey-musgraves-is-a-gay-icon-and-the-world-needs-to-know.html">Kacey Musgraves</a> loves a good rainbow, if you can’t tell by <a href="https://people.com/style/acms-2019-kacey-musgraves-colorful-suit-red-carpet/">her outfits</a> and her song that’s literally called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFv566mj7s">“Rainbow.”</a> She also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwCHXJojyys">loves Willie Nelson</a>, as any stoner country singer should. So how fitting for her to make a connection, if you will, with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/remember-the-crazy-album-the-irs-made-willie-nelson-release.html">Willie Nelson</a> at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/watch-cma-award-women-of-country-performance-dolly-parton.html">the CMAs last night</a>? The two performed Nelson’s cover of “Rainbow Connection,” originally by Kermit the Frog in <i>The Muppet Movie</i>. And oh, it’ll warm your heart as the days get colder and shorter! Just watch Willie look Kacey in the eye while she’s singing. It’s not the first time the two have sung together — Nelson hopped on Musgraves’s <i>Pageant Material</i> track “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCFjYVKAkY">Are You Sure?</a>” in 2015, and then Musgraves’s holiday song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwCHXJojyys">A Willie Nice Christmas</a>” in 2016. Along with giving us the sweetest moment of the night, Musgraves also won female vocalist of the year and video of the year for “Rainbow.”</p>
