      <p>One of the primary goals of SFUNDING is promoting the development of cryptocurrency by presenting Token Games on DApps and connecting current top trending games.</p>
      <p>SFUNDING Token is used as a payment tool for in-game transactions as well as a tradable currency once listed on prestigious Crypto Exchanges. It has high liquidity yet low costs and no intermediary.</p>

        <li>Earning from playing</li>

      <p>Inspired by the sharing economy model, SFUNDING has developed a profit-sharing platform where every users and gamer who participate in or play any games on SFUNDING will have the chance to earn income. The particular ratio of profit shared will be decided upon the amount of money spent to play as well as deposit in.</p>

      <p>Generally, about 35% to 50% of this amount will be sent out as contribution rewards via events, boss hunts, monster hunts, live stream, or Slots.</p>
      <p>The prizes are guaranteed to be attractive and in line with what the players contribute to the system.</p>
      <p>In a discussion related to the development of SFUNDING, a representative of SFU Token stated that remaining features of the Token will be completed in the following time along with deploying Marketing campaigns and customer base development strategies. As the plan is already been carry out, it is expected that SFU Token will be listed on Crypto Exchanges by quarter IV of 2020.</p>

      <p>The most noticeable difference between SFUNDING and other Blockchain platform is the tradability of in-game items and characters. Through an in-game fleamarket, players can buyor sell in-game assets at a suitable price, hence, earning long-term profits.</p>
