      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> star <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3114/sidney-crosby">Sidney Crosby</a> underwent surgery for a core muscle injury Thursday and is out at least six weeks, the team announced.</p>
      <p>General manager Jim Rutherford said the surgery was performed by Dr. William Meyers of the Vincera Institute in Philadelphia. The team said in a statement that Crosby has been dealing with a sports hernia since training camp.</p>
      <p>Crosby, 32, left the ice in the third period of the Penguins' shootout win over the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> on Saturday. It wasn't clear when he was injured, but he had fallen awkwardly and also took a puck off the leg earlier in the game.</p>
      <p>He leads the Penguins with 17 points on five goals and 12 assists in 17 games. Pittsburgh is currently fourth in the Metropolitan Division.</p>
      <p>The Penguins have had unrelenting injury issues this season. Over the first six weeks, forwards <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3124/evgeni-malkin">Evgeni Malkin</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3699/patric-hornqvist">Patric Hornqvist</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/2591155/bryan-rust">Bryan Rust</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/2966502/alex-galchenyuk">Alex Galchenyuk</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/5828/nick-bjugstad">Nick Bjugstad</a> have all missed time due to injuries. Currently, the Penguins are without Hornqvist as well as top defenseman <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3539/kris-letang">Kris Letang</a>, who are both dealing with lower-body injuries.</p>
      <p>According to The Athletic, Crosby initially tried to avoid surgery and play through the pain -- especially because of how many Penguins players were sidelined.</p>
      <p>Crosby has a lengthy injury history. He was limited to 41 games in 2010-11 and missed the playoffs -- as well as the first 20 games of the 2011-12 season -- with concussion symptoms. After only eight games back in 2011, Crosby collided with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/bos/boston-bruins">Boston</a>'s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3343/david-krejci">David Krejci</a>, forcing him to sit another 40 games with concussion symptoms and a neck injury.</p>
      <p>Recently, Crosby has had a decent stretch of health. Before this current setback, Crosby had played in 410 of the Penguins' last 427 games.</p>
