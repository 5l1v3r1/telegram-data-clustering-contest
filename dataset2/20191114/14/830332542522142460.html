      <p>(CNN) - Walmart notched another quarter of strong sales growth and raised its expectations for the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>"We're prepared for a good holiday season," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement Thursday.</p>
      <p>Walmart, America's largest retailer, is a bellwether of consumer health and the retail sector. The company's upbeat results are a sign American consumers are confident heading into the holiday stretch.</p>
      <p>During Walmart's most recent quarter, sales at Walmart stores in the United States open at least a year increased 3.2% compared with the same period a year ago. Walmart's digital sales during its most recent quarter grew 41%, led by online grocery pickups and deliveries. It was Walmart's best quarter of online sales this year.</p>
      <p>The company also raised its guidance for the remainder of the year, reflecting its high expectations for the holidays.</p>
      <p>"Walmart will again be one of the primary pacesetters," Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said.</p>
      <p>In recent years, Walmart has successfully defended its stores against Amazon and rival retailers and pressed its advantage with middle- and lower-income shoppers across the country. Walmart has invested heavily in lowering prices, remodeling stores and expanding online.</p>
      <p>Walmart's stock has increased 29% so far this year, outpacing the S&amp;P 500. Walmart shares rose about 3% during pre-market trading Thursday.</p>
