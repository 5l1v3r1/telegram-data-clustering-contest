      <p>Hockey is a game as white as the surface it’s played on.</p>
      <p>Yes, there are smatterings of colour, but the traditional gatekeepers look a lot like Don Cherry. And we have always known what “Grapes” thinks: About European players, “pinkos”, climate change and the invasion of Iraq. Only one of those topics has anything to do with hockey, by the way.</p>
      <p>And then finally he said “you people,” while taking immigrants to task for not wearing the poppy. He’s not talking about white immigrants, obviously, because how would he be eyeballing them in downtown Toronto?</p>
      <p>We know who he’s talking about because he didn’t say “everybody,” like he’s now claiming he meant.</p>
