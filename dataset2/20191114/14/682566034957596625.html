      <p>Sun City - <b>Ernie Els </b>says he knows the Gary Player Country Club like the back of his hand - and he proved it in the opening round of the 2019 <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/NedbankChallenge/live-nedbank-golf-challenge-round-1-20191114-2">LIVE LEADERBOARD: Nedbank Golf Challenge - Round 1</a>
      </p>
      <p>Els, who received a tournament invitation to compete at Sun City, recorded a bogey-free opening round of 4-under 68.</p>
      <p>The last time Els won a tournament was in 2013 at the European Tour's BMW International Open in Germany.</p>
      <p>The big South African admitted that although he's rarely a title contender nowadays, he's still bursting for the taste of victory.</p>
      <p>"No one really gives me a chance to win, but you still want to play well," Els told reporters after his round on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"If I get something going, I know how to score around this place so it was nice to get to a decent start and ease into the round."</p>
      <p>The four-time Major winner, who won "Africa's Major" in 1999, 2000 and 2002, says he knows the course almost like the back of his hand.</p>
      <p>"I just went on memory going around the golf course... I'm very happy with 68, I didn't expect it," said Els.</p>
      <p>"I came here with a bit of a niggle in my hip - because of all the flying I've been doing - but that worked itself out. I was really pleased I could swing freely."</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old, who will be making his <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/PGATour/ernie-els-set-for-2020-pga-tour-champions-debut-20191107">debut on the PGA Champions Tour</a> next year, insisted he still has a passion for the game.</p>
      <p>"I haven't played well the last two or three years, but I love the game and still enjoy playing." </p>
