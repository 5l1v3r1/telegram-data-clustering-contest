      <p>In a gripping interview with Soccer Laduma this week, Mamelodi Sundowns defender, Mosa Lebusa took one more dig at Kaizer Chiefs about their recent meeting.</p>
      <p>Sundowns suffered a 2-0 Absa Premiership loss to Chiefs late last month, a loss that contributed to the now 10-point gap that Amakhosi hold at the top of the log.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Soccer Laduma in an exclusive interview this week, Lebusa mentioned how Sundowns will not be stopped in defending their Absa Premiership league title despite Chiefs sitting comfortably ahead of everyone else in the league.</p>
      <p>The versatile defender then went on to point out how Amakhosi still do not have any advantage over them because of not playing CAF Champions League football, pointing out how in their previous meeting, Chiefs players were ‘cramping’ despite going in to the encounter as the well-rested side.</p>
      <p>“… if you look at the game we played against them (Chiefs), we had played a midweek game before that, but it did not look like we were the ones who had played in midweek. A lot of their players were getting cramps. I think 80 percent of our team which played midweek started the game against Chiefs. They are a well-rested team, but they are getting cramps, so I don’t want to look at it that way. We have everything we need here (at Chloorkop) to recover. We do hydrotherapy, so there are no complaints. They beat us and we congratulate them. We can’t complain about that,” Lebusa said.</p>
