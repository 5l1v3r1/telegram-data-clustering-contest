      <h1>The crucial role Newcastle United defender could play in the Magpies' pursuit of Granit Xhaka</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle are said to be keen on a January move for the Arsenal midfielder who has been ostracised in North London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:58:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>If Newcastle United do sign Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka, they could have a lot to thank Fabian Schar for.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fabian-schar">Schar</a> has starred for Newcastle since signing from Deportivo La Coruna in the summer of 2018 and he plays alongside Xhaka for the Swiss national side.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has been linked with a winter move to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> after he was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy for his reaction to being booed off by the Gunners supporters when substituted during their 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The former Borussia Monchengladbach and FC Basel midfielder has not played for Arsenal since the incident and Steve Bruce has been led to believe there is a chance to sign him on loan until the end of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/14/newcastle-interested-signing-wantaway-arsenal-star-granit-xhaka/">The Telegraph report</a> that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> has made a new central midfielder his top priority in the January transfer window and feels the 27-year-old would improve the Newcastle squad, giving them more drive in midfield.</p>

      <p>AC Milan are believed to be favourites to sign Xhaka, and Newcastle are looking at other midfield options. However, the Magpies' ace in the pack could be Schar, who shares a close relationship with Xhaka.</p>
      <p>The pair start regularly together for Switzerland and also played together for FC Basel. Xhaka is keen for regular football between now and the end of the season to safeguard his place in the Swiss squad for this summer's EURO 2020.</p>
      <p>Xhaka is said to be aware of Newcastle's interest and has spoken to Schar about the situation. The report claims Schar has told Xhaka 'good things about the club and the city', as he looks to convince him to join him on Tyneside.</p>
