      <h1>Nestle's Seasonal Chocolates Now Includes Smarties Penguins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:00:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>There are five of these bug-eyed characters to choose from, all made from milk chocolate and filled with Smarties.</p>
      <p>If you were envisioning a Penguin bar stuffed with Smarties, you were waaaay off, to the disappointment of us all. The new additions to the Christmas chocolate selection also includes an Aero Bliss advent calendar that will be exclusive to Tesco, featuring three new varieties of the bubble-filled bar: salted caramel, milk chocolate and praline.</p>
      <p>Tesco also gets dibs on KitKat Chunky and Aero selection boxes, while only Asda will be selling the Smarties retro giant tube, and Smarties Santa Claus figures. Something else Nestle is rolling out for the first time this year is the giant Rowntree’s Randoms and Rowntree’s Randoms Squish’ems, and a sharing tub of Rowntree’s Randoms, which I would take as more of a light suggestion and share with myself.</p>

      <p>"We’re particularly excited to introduce our Smarties penguins for Christmas 2019. Available in a variety of sizes and price points, their bright colours and the mini Smarties inside make them a standout addition to the kid’s novelty market. We can’t wait for you to shake them home today!," said enthused Nestle senior brand manager, Jon Smith.</p>
      <p>On the advent calendar front, the Aero variant will be joined by Smarties, Milkybar, and After Eight options, as well as an updated Quality Street which now includes the new caramel chocolate brownie sweet.</p>
      <p>So p-p-pick up a penguin and enjoy.</p>
