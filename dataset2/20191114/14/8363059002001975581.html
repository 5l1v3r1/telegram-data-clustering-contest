      <h1>Lego Has More AR-Powered Hidden Side Sets Coming Next Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:40:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year Lego announced it was moving into the AR business with <i>Hidden Side</i>, a ghost-hunting theme that lets people interact play with both sets and a smartphone app. It's quite a clever concept, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/what-we-think-about-legos-new-hidden-side-ar-range/">as we've discussed previously</a>, and it looks like there's more to come in 2020.</p>
      <p>Everything was uncovered in <a href="https://www.legonewsroom.de/?p=7812">Lego's German newsroom</a> by <a href="https://www.promobricks.de/">Promobricks</a>, and give us a detailed look at what we can expect from <i>Hidden Side</i> next year. Sadly the prices are all in Euros, but that still gives us an idea of how much we should expect to pay.</p>

      <p>As you can see there have been a lot of changes. Main characters Jack and Parker have had a few upgrades, and it seems as though El Fuego is a skeleton now. Also the possessed characters have had some serious upgrades (did you see the one with two heads?) and the ghosts themselves are finally making a physical appearance.</p>
      <p>At the moment they're restricted to the app, which Lego told me was deliberate, not now it seems they feel it's best to throw out some more spooky minifigs.</p>
      <p>No word on an actual release date yet, but fans will be glad to see that these are not overpriced this time round. The Newbury High School was nice, but it was pricey.</p>
