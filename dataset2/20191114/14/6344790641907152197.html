      <h1>J.J. Abrams Talks About Discussing STAR WARS with George Lucas - "He loves his Midi-chlorians"</h1>

      <p>It’s hard not to think about how these new <i>Star Wars</i> films would have turned out if <b>George Lucas</b> had a hand in the creative decisions that were made. While I’ve enjoyed the films, it would have been interesting to see his vision for the ending of the Skywalker saga realized.</p>
      <p>While Disney and <b>J.J. Abrams</b> didn’t really use many of his idea, Abrams did sit down with Lucas to talk to him about bringing the saga to an end with <b><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></b>. Of course Abrams is going to go to Lucas for advice because in this final film, he has to wrap up so many different elements from eight other movies. That’s not an easy task, but I hope that Abrams actually pulls it off.</p>
      <p>While talking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-jj-abrams-george-lucas-midichlorians/">Total Film.Games Radar</a>, Abrams talked about discussing <i>Star Wars</i> with Geroge Lucas, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“He had a lot of things to say about the nature of the Force, the themes that he was dealing with when he was writing the movies. Yes, there were some conversations about Midi-chlorians – he loves his Midi-chlorians. But it was a very helpful thing. Sitting with him is a treat, just to hear him talk, because it’s fucking George Lucas talking about Star Wars. I always feel it’s a gift to hear him talk about that stuff. Because the effect that he had on me at 10 years old is utterly profound.” </blockquote>
      <p>While Abrams feels like it’s a gift to sit down with Lucas to talk about<i> Star Wars</i>, the real question is, did Abrams actually take any advice from him and implement it into the movie? I guess we’ll eventually find out at some point after the movie is released.</p>
      <p><i>The Rise of Skywalker </i>hits theaters on December 20th.</p>
