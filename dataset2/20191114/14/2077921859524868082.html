      <h1>Here's What Late Night Made of the First Day of Impeachment Hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:05:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Russell  </a></address>
      <p>The historic impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a> kicked off its first day of public hearings on Wednesday, with Ambassador William Taylor and State Department official George Kent delivering testimony that even <i>Fox News </i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/chris-wallace-william-taylors-testimony-very-damaging-to-president-trump">called</a> “very damaging” to the top tangerine. Needless to say, the many <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/talking+heads">talking heads</a> of late night (even Jimmy Fallon!) had plenty to say about the proceedings, riffing on everything from Trump’s utterly careless blunders to his pretending to ignore the hearings. Catch up on all the jokes about this very serious matter below.</p>

      <p>The next impeachment hearing is set for this Friday, Nov. 15, per <i><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/13/20961074/impeachment-hearings-testimony-live-stream-taylor-kent">Vox</a></i>, with testimony from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. We have a feeling late night will have more jokes to go with it, so be sure to check back.
