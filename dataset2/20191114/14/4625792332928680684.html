      <h1>Ocasio-Cortez: Impeaching Trump 'is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome' in 2020</h1>

      <p>Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez admitted that the Democrats' efforts to investigate President Trump are, in part, meant to prevent him from winning reelection in November 2020.</p>
      <p>The freshman New York congresswoman made the admission in an interview on CNN Wednesday evening, hours after the House had its <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/william-taylor-im-not-a-star-witness-for-democrats">first public hearing in the impeachment investigation</a> into Trump's foreign policy decisions regarding Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"I think many of those considerations will be taken up by the Judiciary Committee when all of this evidence is brought forth," Ocasio-Cortez stated. "We’ll see. I personally do believe that the president has engaged in flagrant violations of the emoluments clause. I'm concerned that we would allow this corruption to continue. But at the end of the day, we have to be able to come together as a caucus, and if it is this Ukrainian allegation that is what brings the caucus together, then I think we have to run with however we unify the House."</p>
      <p>Ocasio-Cortez has called for the president's impeachment since <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-impeach-trump-now">before her inauguration</a>.</p>
      <p>"While I believe personally that we should be pursuing and investigating quite flagrant abuses of the emoluments clause, even reporting as recently as the suspicious stops at Trump properties even in congressional delegations or rather in foreign trips, I think all of this is game for investigation," she added.</p>
      <p>"We also need to move quite quickly because we’re talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections. This is not just about something that has occurred, this is about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year," she concluded.</p>
