      <p>ROME, Nov 14 — Though a hardtop version of the Portofino has been expected since the convertible was announced in 2017, Ferrari went ahead and used this opportunity as a chance to do more than add a permanent roof: the model got a new name and a new body style.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Ferrari unveiled the Roma — “La Nuova Dolce Vita” — during a private event held in Rome, the perfect place to reveal a model inspired by Italy’s capital city.</p>
      <p>Though Roma serves as a hardtop version of the Portofino convertible announced back in 2017, the company describes this coupe as having a “timeless design” that models “the carefree, pleasurable way of life that characterised Rome in the 1950s and ‘60s.”</p>

      <p>To embody this essence, the body was restyled when compared with its drop-top counterpart with smooth contours (“all superfluous detailing has been removed”), a front end that angles more sharply to the ground, and a fastback rear, all executed in a way that is contemporary but can be found on sports cars from the past 70 years.</p>
      <p>The power that the Roma delivers matches its modern flair. The engine is a turbo charged V8 (the same found in the Portofino) which puts out over 600 hp, allowing the car to sprint from 0 mph to 62 mph in 3.4 seconds.</p>
      <p>The interior was designed to put the driver in control of their experience. The cabin body panels wrap in such a way that the driver and the passenger sit in individual cells with functional elements being distributed throughout each side of the cockpit.</p>
      <p>This model is the final one the company will announce this year.</p>
      <p>Ferrari is expected to reveal availability and pricing information soon. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
