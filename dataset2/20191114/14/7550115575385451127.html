      <p>Salah initially joined up with his international team-mates ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros, but will now miss out.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is still struggling with the ankle problem suffered in the 2-1 victory over Leicester at the start of October, having suffered recurring issues.</p>
      <p>He was left clutching his foot after a challenge with Fernandinho in Sunday’s win at home to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a>, but had insisted on departing to Egypt to meet the rest of Hossam El Badry’s squad.</p>
      <p>Now, he has used Instagram to reveal that Partridge has joined him to oversee his rehabilitation, with Liverpool no doubt eager for him to take part against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> next Saturday.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have taken routine measures to manage Salah’s fitness since Hamza Choudhury’s late tackle at Anfield, limiting his involvement in training and providing regular treatment, and he is now wearing a protective boot.</p>
      <p>There is no negligence in this approach, and the club will be desperate to ensure he stays fit enough to maintain his key role in <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s attack.</p>
      <p>He is likely to endure heightened discomfort on the day after games, and will be told to keep his ankle elevated and stay off it whenever possible.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether Salah will be fit for the trip to Selhurst Park, though Klopp clearly has options to rotate if he is unavailable—and this may be the sensible option.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a> have both filled roles in the attack this season, while <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/xherdan-shaqiri/">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> is expected back from injury after the break.</p>
      <p>There have been suggestions the No. 11 could miss up to four weeks, though <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11860813/mohamed-salah-liverpool-forwards-return-date-unclear-after-ankle-injury">Sky Sports</a> report that his layoff “remains unclear.”</p>
      <p>If that were to be his timeframe for recovery, Salah could miss the next six games, including the final two group fixtures in the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/champions-league">Champions League</a> and the Merseyside derby at Anfield.</p>
