      <p>Honor V30 teaser reveals Oval-Punch Hole; featuring Huang Jingyu<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Honor is all set for the imminent arrival of Honor V30 and V30 Pro. Both smartphones are scheduled for a November 26 launch. However, since the beginning of the week, it seems that Huawei’s subsidiary has lost all interest in keeping the device a mystery. Yesterday we got a glimpse of the handset’s triple camera setup as well as a photo sample. Now, <a href="https://www.weibo.com/3206603957/Ig8uchtTZ?filter=hot&amp;root_comment_id=0&amp;type=comment">another video clip</a> reveals interesting details about the upcoming smartphone.</p>

      <p>The above video gives us a brief view of the handset’s display. Interestingly enough, it features the Chinese actor Huang Jingyu who shows his busy routine with his Honor V30. At the 0:07 mark, it’s possible to spot the actual Honor V30 in hand. It has minimalistic bezels and punch-hole serving as a house for the dual front camera setup. Apart from the camera capabilities, Honor is giving great importance to V30’s 5G capabilities, therefore, this new video didn’t disappoint and praises again the next-gen connectivity support.</p>

      <p>According to the rumors, the V30 duo will feature a triple-camera array which will be lead by a 60MP shooter. The 60MP will be a first for Honor smartphones and an upgrade over Honor V20’s 48MP sensor. Moreover, the handset may ship with a Kirin 990 and will support up to 40W fast-charging.</p>
      <p>Everything may be confirmed in the coming days. Although we’re still several days from the release, the leaks and teasers are popping out every day.</p>
