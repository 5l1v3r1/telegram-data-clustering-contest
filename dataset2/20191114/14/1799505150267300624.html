      <p>GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (AFP) — The Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday introduced a second vaccine to fight a 15-month-old epidemic of Ebola in the east of the country, Doctors Without Borders said.</p>

      <p>The new vaccine, produced by a Belgian subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, will be administered to about 50,000 people over four months, the charity said.</p>
      <p>More than 250,000 people, many of them frontline health workers, have been immunized with another anti-Ebola vaccine in a program begun last year.</p>
      <p>The epidemic began in August 2018 in the province of North Kivu and spread to neighboring Ituri and South Kivu — a remote and largely lawless region bordering Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
      <p>The notorious hemorrhagic virus has killed 2,193 people in this round, according to the latest official figures.</p>
      <p>It is the DRC’s 10<sup>th</sup> Ebola epidemic and the second deadliest on record, after an outbreak that struck West Africa in 2014-16, claiming more than 11,300 lives.</p>
      <p>Fifteen people received an injection of the new vaccine in Doctors Without Borders facilities in the North Kivu capital of Goma early Thursday, a spokeswoman for the charity said.</p>
      <p>The formula is administered in two doses at 56-day intervals, and those who have received the vaccine have been reminded to return for the second shot, she said.</p>
      <p>The disease’s epicenter is about 220 miles north of Goma, a sprawling urban hub of nearly 2 million people on the border with Rwanda.</p>
      <p>Four Ebola cases were recorded in the city in July and August, sparking fears the virus could spin out of control in a chaotic, mobile environment.</p>
      <p>Efforts to combat Ebola in eastern DR Congo have been hampered by militia violence and local resistance to preventative measures, care facilities and safe burials.</p>
      <p>Health workers have been attacked 300 times, leaving six people dead and 70 wounded since the start of the year.</p>
      <p>Despite these problems, statistics point to a downward trend.</p>
      <p>The health ministry late Wednesday said it had recorded four new cases of Ebola but no deaths, while 508 suspected cases were being monitored.</p>
      <p>“In its current phase, the epidemic is not urban but has become rural,” Professor Jean-Jacques Muyemebe, in charge of coordinating the anti-Ebola fight, said in October.</p>
      <p>“We have to track it down, force it into a corner and eliminate it,” he said.</p>
      <p>The new J&amp;J vaccine was initially rejected by DRC’s former health minister Oly Ilunga, who cited the risks of introducing a new product in communities where mistrust of Ebola responders is already high.</p>
      <p>But Ilunga’s resignation in July appears to have paved the way for approval of the second vaccine. He faces charges that he embezzled Ebola funds.</p>
      <p>Both vaccines are novel formulas that when they were introduced had been tested for safety but were unlicensed, meaning that they had yet to achieve formal approval from drug authorities.</p>
      <p>The first vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, has been given to 251,079 people, according to figures released late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Manufactured by the U.S. laboratory Merck Sharpe and Dohme, the vaccine was licensed by the European Commission last week. It is being marketed under the brand name Ervebo.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it had “prequalified” Ervebo — an important regulatory procedure that will allow the drug to be deployed quickly in Ebola outbreaks.</p>
      <p>The Ebola virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person.</p>
      <p>After incubation of up to three weeks, a high fever develops, coinciding with weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.</p>
      <p>This is often followed by vomiting and diarrhea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.</p>
      <p>The death rate is high, ranging up to 90% in some outbreaks.</p>
      <p>The virus’s natural reservoir is suspected to be a tropical bat which does not itself fall ill but can pass on the microbe to humans who hunt it for food.</p>
