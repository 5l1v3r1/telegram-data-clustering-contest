      <p><i>Age of Empires II: Definite Edition </i>has taken up the spotlight lately, but during today's X019 presentation in London, we got a look – a real, non-concept-arty look – at the future of the series, <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/"><i>Age of Empires IV</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Along with <i>Age of Empires IV</i> gameplay footage, we also learned that Microsoft's dedicated <i>Age of Empires </i>studio is now going by World's Edge. As a reminder, <i>Age of Empires IV</i> is a partnership between Microsoft and developer Relic Entertainment (<i>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</i> and <i>Company of Heroes</i>), and they're looking to "bring this franchise back to the forefront of gaming."</p>
      <p>The timing here couldn't be better, what with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813780/Age_of_Empires_II_Definitive_Edition/"><i>AoE II: Definitive Edition</i></a> hitting Steam today.</p>
