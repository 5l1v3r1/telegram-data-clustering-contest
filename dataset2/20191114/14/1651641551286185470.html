      <h1>Motorola RAZR hands-on round-up: Motorola is relying heavily on the idea of a foldable phone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Raka</a></address>
      <p>Motorola has<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/motorola-razr-officially-announced-will-be-available-for-1500-from-verizon/"> announced its first-ever foldable Android smartphone RAZR</a>. The $1,500 foldable smartphone is going to be available for purchase in 2020 as Verizon exclusive in the USA.</p>
      <p>The design of the new RAZR phone looks quite simple, as opposed to that of the Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X. Motorola’s new foldable phone is something that we’re already familiar with — the new RAZR opens and closes like a classic flip phone.</p>
      <p>While the concept of a foldable phone is intriguing to everyone who loves tech, at the end of the day it really comes down to whether or not the specs of the smartphone justifies the price tag, and it appears that Motorola wants to sell the RAZR by just relying heavily on the idea of a foldable phone and nothing else.</p>
      <h3>The Verge</h3>
      <p>When you’re planning to spend a hefty $1,500 on a smartphone, you expect it to have the latest processor, powerful camera performance, good battery life, among other things, but unfortunately, the RAZR fails in almost every area, according to The Verge.</p>
      <blockquote>AfterAfter a few hours with the 2019 Motorola Razr, I’m still not sure if it’s going to be a <i>good</i> phone, at least not in the conventional sense. It’s too expensive, with specs that are too weak for the price, especially compared to the wealth of more powerful phones with better cameras and hardware that are available. And the foldable display technology is too untested to be truly reliable, even with Motorola’s assurances.<br/>But I’m still really excited by the Razr and the fact that it exists. It’s a phone that looks and feels like the future of phones. We’ll have to spend a lot more time with the device to see whether Motorola manages to stick the landing on its first attempt. But if nothing else, it’s a bold idea that pushes the concept of what a smartphone looks like forward, and that’s an exciting thing to see.</blockquote>

      <h3>Android Central</h3>
      <p>Danial Bader over at Android Central raises similar concerns about the latest RAZR foldable smartphone.</p>
      <blockquote>But I wonder if that’s just what it is: a showpiece, a design object, something to show off. As practical as the phone itself is, the circumstances around its price and availability make it the very opposite of practical. Whether that’s ultimately to Verizon’s and Motorola’s benefit remains to be seen, but the RAZR, unlike its 2004 predecessor which sold in the millions, is unlikely to reach the pockets of more than a few thousand people.</blockquote>

      <h3>Cnet</h3>
      <blockquote>I’ve never met a perfect phone, and the Motorola Razr already shows some trade-offs. The phone’s main 16-megapixel camera is a good start, but it lacks the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-11-goes-pro-with-photography-max/">telephoto and wide-angle lenses</a> that have become the hallmark of premium devices. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Fold gives you six of them.<br/>There’s also a question mark over battery life. Motorola put a battery in both sides of the Razr, for a combined total of 2,500 mAh. That helps balance out the weight, but two separate batteries are typically less efficient than one. Motorola says the battery will last a day. For reference, the Galaxy Fold battery adds up to 4,380 mAh.</blockquote>

      <h3>Digital Trends</h3>
      <p>While interactive outer screen, seamless look, mediocre internals and durability are going to hurt the sales, according to the Digital Trends.</p>
      <blockquote> It’s essentially a regular smart phone in a Motorola Razr form factor that looks different and nostalgic, while also achieving a bit of a futuristic look. Fold it up, drop it in your pocket, and now you’re  in the future.<br/>Yet with a hefty price tag, internals that underwhelm, and no other groundbreaking features to speak of, the Motorola Razr relies a lot on design and nostalgia to win over fans.</blockquote>

      <h3>Tech Radar</h3>
      <blockquote>In many ways, the new phone inherits the old Razr’s initial reputation as a pricey status symbol – though instead of a fashion flex, the new Razr is a design darling. Yes, it’s a big nostalgia play, but it’s also an innovative new direction that smartphones could follow to break out of the black rectangle convention.<br/>And yet, convention drives down costs, and the unique design in the new Razr comes at a price. It’s hard to tell whether the novel form factor will convince folks to fork over more money for functionality they could largely have at a much lower pricetag.</blockquote>
