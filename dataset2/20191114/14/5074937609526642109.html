      <p>Kwahu Pepease (E/R), Nov. 14, GNA - The Pepease District of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana has commissioned a computer laboratory for schools in Kwahu Pepease in the Kwahu East District of the Eastern Region.</p>
      <p>The facility is to serve five basic schools in the area and to equip the students with Information and Communicarion Technology (ICT) to help promote effective teaching and learning in the community.</p>
      <p>At a short ceremony held to commission and hand over the project to the community, Reverend George Kwame Acheampong, the Kwahu Presbytery Chairperson said, the ICT centre was established to aid education delivery.</p>

      <p>Rev Acheampong said the church would continue to offer the needed support to ensure that every child is not deprived of his right to education, no matter their location.</p>
      <p>Rev KennedyTwum-Barimah, the Pepease District Minister, on behalf of the church, expressed appreciation to the Founder and Leader of Give Hope Global, Mr Roger Braswell and team for donating five laptops, desktop computers and projector to the facility.</p>
      <p>He said the NGO has also promised to provide more computers for the laboratory to ensure its effective operation and called on well to do citizens of Kwahu Pepease at home and abroad to support the project.</p>
      <p>Madam Ivy Asantewaa Owusu, the Kwahu East District Director of Education, thanked the Church and the other donors for the gesture.</p>
      <p>She also expressed her gratitude to the District Minister, Rev. Kennedy Twum-Barimah, for his support and vision for education in the district.</p>
