      <p>Motorola have brought back the classic Razr flip phone, 15 years after the original device was released.</p>
      <p>The new incarnation of the phone features a 6.2 inch screen which folds together when closed. The phone also has a smaller “quick view” screen on the outer shell to display notifications.</p>
      <p>The phone will first be available to buy in the US for $1500 on December 26 with other countries following later.</p>
      <p>You can see some videos of the new phone below:</p>

      <p>Described by Motorola as feating an “impossible” feat of engineering, the phone now features a folding screen which closes completely.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50414612">BBC</a>, Glenn Schultz who is the head of product development at Motorola said: “With the new Razr we had to rethink how to engineer a phone.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Our zero-gap hinge allowed us to bring to market a device that folds completely in half. Many didn’t believe we could do it, but let me tell you, it’s fun to work on something that everyone thinks is impossible.”</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/daniel-day-lewis-actually-still-uses-a-flip-phone-2284116">it was revealed that Oscar winning actor Daniel Day Lewis still uses a flip phone. </a></p>
      <p>Journalist Karen Han spotted the actor on the subway in New York and shared a picture of the moment, tweeting: “Daniel Day-Lewis is on my train and casually just looking at his flip phone”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Robbie Williams revealed earlier this week that he hadn’t owned a phone since 2006. Speaking on Back of the Net, Williams said: “I haven’t owned a phone since 2006. I’m always on my computer, I’ve always got Wi-Fi.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I got rid of [my phone] because I just don’t like them.”</p>
