        <i>Two West Mercia officers had returned to limited duties after initially being suspended</i>
      </p>
      <p>The two police officers facing criminal charges over the death of the former footballer Dalian Atkinson have been suspended from duty, the Guardian has learned.</p>
      <p>One officer, PC Benjamin Monk, faces a charge of murder, while another, PC Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith, is charged with assault.</p>
      <p>The family of the former Aston Villa player, who died in August 2016 after contact with police, said they were surprised the officers had not been suspended until this week.</p>
      <p>The West Mercia officers were initially suspended after being placed under investigation, then returned to work on restricted duties in February 2018.</p>
      <p>The two officers were suspended this week after the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to charge them with criminal offences.</p>
      <p>Atkinson, 48, died after police were called to his father’s home in Telford, Shropshire, in the early hours of 15 August 2016. A stun gun and other force were used on the former footballer during the incident.</p>

      <p>Kate Maynard, the solicitor for the Atkinson family, welcomed the suspension of the officers: “The family were surprised to hear in February 2018 that the officers had been reinstated (albeit on restricted duties) following their initial suspension. They welcome that the officers are now suspended again and look forward to the criminal process taking its course.”</p>
      <p>The charges followed a three-year investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct.</p>
      <p>West Mercia police said: “The officers were suspended whilst the initial IOPC investigation was under way. This was reviewed in February 2018 and the officers returned to work on restricted duties.”</p>
      <p>The assistant chief constable of West Mercia police, Martin Evans, said: “In accordance with the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2012, following the decision by CPS to charge the officers with a criminal offence, a suspension hearing has taken place. The hearing happened on Tuesday 12 November and both officers were suspended from duty.”</p>
      <p>The two officers were initially not named, but at a hearing on Wednesday at Birmingham crown court, a judge ruled they could be after a challenge by six news organisations.</p>
      <p>The IOPC had previously said of its inquiry: “The investigation gathered evidence which indicates that police contact with Mr Atkinson involved the use of a Taser, followed by a period of restraint and other uses of force.”</p>
      <p>The events that led to the criminal charges being brought happened while Atkinson, who lived nearby, was visiting his father in Telford. A neighbour rang the police and officers were called to the scene at 1.30am. Atkinson was pronounced dead 90 minutes later in hospital.</p>
      <p>Monk 41, and Bettley-Smith, 29, are on unconditional bail awaiting their trial.</p>
