      <h2>The Black Tag event is now live at Carphone Warehouse and the retailer has told customers they won’t get cheaper</h2>

      <p>Black Friday deals are dropping thick and fast - and there’s still two weeks to go before the official event takes place.</p>
      <p>November 29th might look like a long way off in your calendar, but retailers are already slashing prices on everything from kitchen appliances to laptops and Smart Tvs to Smart tech.</p>
      <p>And if it’s a nifty new mobile phone you’re after, <a href="https://fave.co/2N4Dx4W">Carphone Warehouse</a> has just launched its Black Tag deals offering shoppers huge savings. </p>
      <p>As well as offers on <a href="https://fave.co/2N4Dx4W">iPhones, Samsung and Sony Xperia phones</a> , there's also going to be discounts on the brand new iPhone 11.</p>
      <p>But the best thing about Carphone Warehouse's early Black Friday offers is that the retailer has promised that no deals will get any better come Black Friday.</p>
