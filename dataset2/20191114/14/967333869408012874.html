      <p>Former two-term governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick has announced his bid for the White House.</p>
      <blockquote>"I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field that bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat. But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country. So in the spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States", Patrick said.</blockquote>
