        <b>Australia's seasoned paceman Mitchell Starc looks all set to roar against Pakistan as he shared that he is in perfect mindset and rhythm coming from Sheffield Shield games. Starc, who has been named in the 14-man squad for the Test series, heaped his fellow pacers with praise for their skills.</b>

      <p>Cricket Australia has named a 14-man squad for the home season opener against Pakistan. While the batting department has some drastic changes the bowling department seems pretty much unchanged as the Kangaroos' seem to stick to the five pacers and one spinner format of theirs.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Starc who played only a single match in the Ashes series in England has been included in the squad as he will look to make an impact on the back of impressive performances in the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales. Starc shared he is great rhythm and mindset going into the series.</p>
      <p>"I've just been happy with the rhythm and things that I worked on to get in a clearer mindset. The things that I worked on coming out of the Gabba Shield game into the Drummoyne game, and being pretty focused and clear since the Gabba game and throughout the T20s as well is pretty pleasing for me," Starc was quoted as saying by www.cricket.com.au.</p>
      <p>"It's nice to contribute to wins for NSW and Australia and hopefully now having that mindset and that rhythm, having worked on that the last few weeks, hopefully that can carry on through the summer."</p>
      <p>Australia are going into the series with five speedsters in the squad, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, James Pattinson and Michael Neser including Starc. The 29 year old has heaped his fellow teammates with praise as he is confident that their skill couples with Nathan Lyon's trickery will be fatal for the men in green.</p>
      <p>"We spoke about the squad mentality during the Ashes series and having five fast bowlers again it's going to be same thing. Ness (Neser) bowled really well in that 'A' game (against Pakistan in Perth) from the little pieces that I saw and from what I've heard. Patto (Pattinson) has been bowling really nicely and Joshy (Hazlewood), Patty (Cummins) and myself are pretty happy with how we've been progressing -- Patty and I with the white ball and Josh as well in Adelaide," he added.</p>
      <p>"Gaz (off-spinner Nathan Lyon) does what Gaz does and he's a big part of the Australian team. We haven't come into camp yet but no doubt it will be a squad mentality with the fast bowlers."</p>
