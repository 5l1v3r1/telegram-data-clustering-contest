      <p>We’ve heard a lot of <b>Google Maps</b>’ new features recently and here’s another one to join the family! <b>Google</b> has now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20961977/google-maps-translate-ios-android-directions-language">integrated</a> one of its useful services which is Google Translate into the navigation app. It is said to bring a lot of conveniences while you’re traveling in another country which speaks a different language.</p>
      <p>For example, the app now will help you to translate the name of a place from your native language to another foreign language. It will also speak the name out loud using Text-to-Speech for the locals to understand. It comes really handy when you’re asking for directions to a certain place when you don’t know how to speak their language.</p>
