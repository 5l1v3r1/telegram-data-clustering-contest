      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:53:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Sad news for fans of 2006’s <b><i>Prey</i></b> and the recently-released <b><i>Rune 2</i></b>, as developer Human Head Studios is closing. The studio’s community manager, Katherine Stull, broke the news in <a href="https://www.humanhead.com/update-human-head-studios/">a blog post</a>. “After 22 great years of making games as an independent studio, economic realities have forced us to make the decision to wind down the company and close its doors.”</p>
      <p>However, all is not lost for the team, as Bethesda have hired the entire team on as part of a new studio called Roundhouse Studios, which will be working on some mystery projects. However, this brings into question just what will happen with <i>Rune 2</i>, which just came out yesterday. In <a href="https://www.rune2.com/topic/rune-ii-human-head-studios-closing/">an official statement</a>, the publisher says it plans to continue supporting <i>Rune 2</i> despite Human Head’s sudden closure. “First and foremost: we love this game and we will continue to support <i>Rune 2</i> and provide the same great open communication and transparency that you’ve come to expect from us.”</p>
      <p>Aside from <i>Prey</i> and <i>Rune</i>, Human Head Studios got its start developing the 2000 game based on the first <i>Blair Witch</i> film, <b><i>Blair Witch Volume II: The Legend of Coffin Rock</i></b> before scoring with <i>Rune</i> the next year. The team also chipped in to help 2K Games with 2013’s <b><i>BioShock Infinite</i></b>, as well as the Wii U version of <b><i>Batman: Arkham Origins</i></b>.</p>
