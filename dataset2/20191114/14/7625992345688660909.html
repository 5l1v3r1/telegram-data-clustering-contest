      <p><b>SPORTS:</b> Women's boxing<br/>Heather Hardy and Amanda Serrano, two of the biggest names in women's boxing, have known each other for years. But recently, when they climbed into the ring at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, they weren't thinking about their friendship. They were thinking about combat. Correspondent Kelefa Sanneh talked with exemplars of a sport that still receives much less recognition than men's boxing, and where prizefighting comes without much of a prize.</p>

      <p><b>      <br/>PASSAGE:</b> TBD</p>
      <p><b>      <br/>BOOKS:</b> John le Carré<br/>John le Carré is 88 now, and 25 novels, 10 films and 6 TV adaptations later, he has new villains: The people trying to take Britain out of the European Union. The author talks with Mark Phillips about his latest novel of intrigue, "Agent Running in the Field," which examines how the British public is being "bamboozled by people with private interests" in the push for Brexit.</p>
      <p><b>FROM THE ARCHIVES:</b> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/from-1996-the-secret-world-of-john-le-carre/">The secret world of John le Carré (Video)</a><br/>The putative end of the Cold War didn't mark the end for master spy storyteller John le Carré, who continued to write thrilling bestsellers of international intrigue and duplicity. Mark Phillips talked with the writer about how his "secret world" hadn't changed all that much, and with London tailor Douglas Hayward, who served as a source of inspiration for the British expat who finds himself in the middle of a plot in crime-and drug-ridden Panama City, in le Carré's novel, "The Tailor of Panama." Originally broadcast on "CBS Sunday Morning" November 17, 1996.</p>

His 1998 book, "The Greatest Generation," became a bestselling testimonial to the men and women who selflessly fought, and won, World War II.

It was begun by Renee Powell<i>, </i>the second African-American to play on the LPGA Tour. She and her brother, groundskeeper Larry Powell, talked with CBS News special correspondent James Brown about how their father, a World War II veteran, turned a former dairy farm into an 18-hole public course, and how her family did not let roadblocks stand in the way of their love for the sport.</p>
