      <h1>Callum Hudson-Odoi explains one conversation with Frank Lampard ended Bayern Munich interest</h1>
      <h2>Callum Hudson-Odoi was heavily linked with Bayern Munich in the summer before agreeing a new five-year contract at Stamford Bridge.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T14:50:21+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi has revealed it only took one conversation with Frank Lampard to convince him to sign a new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> deal and insists he is pleased with his decision to snub Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was heavily linked with a move to the Bundesliga giants in the summer before agreeing a new five-year contract at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The winger broke into the Blues side under Maurizio Sarri last season and did enough to earn his England senior debut only to have the campaign curtailed by a serious Achilles injury.</p>
      <p>He missed the Europa League final and the Nations League finals as a result but has impressed since returning to fitness, earning a Three Lions recall for the forthcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>

      <p>Things could have been different if the club had not appointed Lampard as Sarri's successor as the former Chelsea midfielder had to do little to convince Hudson-Odoi to stay put.</p>
      <p>Asked how many conversations he had with Lampard before agreeing to sign, he replied: "One.</p>
      <p>"I can't say exactly what he said but he just said he believes in me, he wants me to work hard and if I believe in myself then he believes in me and things will go well for me at this club.</p>
      <p>"And he wants me to play for him. They were encouraging signs for me that you want to hear from a manager, that he believes in you and he has faith in you, that you can become a good player and achieve a lot of stuff at the club.</p>
      <p>"I was excited. It was exciting times that a new manager was coming in and also you know that he will play at least some of the youth boys as well.</p>

      <p>"So it's good to know that you are going to play with some of the players from before.</p>
      <p>"I said from the start that I made the right decision to stay at Chelsea. I've been there all my life. I've loved the club from day one."</p>
      <p>Lampard has overseen a sea change in approach at Chelsea as, hamstrung with a FIFA transfer ban, he has turned to the youth team and academy products.</p>
      <p>The early results have been impressive with Hudson-Odoi joining Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham as young Blues players included in Gareth Southgate's England squad.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy to be around the boys," added Hudson-Odoi.</p>

      <p>"Obviously the academy boys who have come through are playing loads of games. It's just a good bond. Great to be around each other.</p>
      <p>"I'm really happy that I stayed. I just want to keep working hard for the team and achieve something with the club.</p>
      <p>"We've all got a great bond coming from the academy and having that good spirit. I think all of us like being around each other.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes we will stick with each other, we all chill with each other, play games with each other but with England you've got to have a bond with everybody.</p>
      <p>"I like to get around and speak to everybody. I also go to other age groups, the Under-21s, the Under-19s - sometimes speak to the boys there as well. See how they're doing."</p>
