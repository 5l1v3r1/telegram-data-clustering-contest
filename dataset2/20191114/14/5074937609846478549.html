      <p>Kumasi, Nov.14, GNA - The Kuapa Kokoo Cooperative Cocoa Farmers and Marketing Union Limited (KKFU) is implementing a gender-based programme that seeks to resource and empower women in cocoa zones to act as drivers of change for positive impacts in their communities and the country as a whole.</p>
      <p>Madam Fatima Ali, who made this known, said women’s socio-economic empowerment was fundamental to realizing gender equity, inclusive participation in decision-making and economic independence.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Union in Kumasi, she pointed out that the skills training, gender justice, micro-credit schemes and alternative livelihood projects being implemented for women in the Union, were aimed at empowering them to actively participate in the business and governance of the organization at all levels.</p>
      <p>This year’s conference was held under the theme “building strategic partnerships to reduce hunger and end extreme poverty”.</p>
      <p>Madam Ali said KKFU in collaboration with its partner organizations across the globe, were committed to implement programmes to reduce gender gaps and promote equality in the economic and political lives of women by providing support and tools for training and capacity building.</p>
      <p>She said the National Executive Committee (NEC) and Management of the Union were working hard to ensure that cocoa farmers had improved income to enable their households attain decent standards of living.</p>
      <p>On the TeleAgric programme, she said it had taken-off with pilot phase on-going at Ofoase in the Ejisu-Juaben cocoa district.</p>
      <p>Madam Ali said with support from the Millennium Promise Alliance, about 500 members of the Union in the community had received smartphones, installed with applications to help them detect diseases, ensure plant health, and thereby, increase their yields.</p>
      <p>Mr Nelson Adubofuor, the Acting Executive Secretary of KKFU, said a total of 55,456 farmers made up of 19,401 females and 36,036 males had been trained in best agronomic practices and provided with extension support to improve farming practices.</p>
