        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 14 – Nairobi County Assembly leaders continued to trade accusations over escalating tensions at City Hall with two rival factions attributing the chaos to differences between senior political figures in the administration.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nairobi West MCA Maurice Gari and his Hamza Counterpart Mark Ndung’u – both allied to County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi – blamed ousted Majority Leader Abdi Guyo for poor leadership, intimidation of the members during an appearance before the Senate Devolution and Intergovernmental Committee on Thursday.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“The major issue that has affected our county is poor leadership from the former Majority Leader and even the Minority who we have procedurally and peacefully removed. The two would sit in a meeting and decide the direction that would be taken by MCAs and no one can question them,” Gari said.</p>
      <p>Guyo who appeared before the same committee however defended himself from the claims accusing Governor Mike Sonko of instigating infighting among MCAs to divert their attention from exercising its oversight mandate over the executive.</p>
      <p>“When your head has a problem, automatically your whole body will have a problem. The problem with this institution is Governor Sonko himself. You can see the revenue has dropped from Sh.11bn to 7.8bn. That tells you, that there is a big problem,” he said.</p>
      <p>Guyo and MCAs linked to him have opposed Elachi’s speakership since the labour court reinstated her.</p>
      <p>“You know people fear governor Sonko, but I am ready to face him head on for the sake of the Nairobi residents. He must stop using his position to intimidate us from doing our job and his is always ready to fire and suspend any staff who seems to challenge him.”</p>
      <p>Guyo further accused Sonko of having over six thousand ghost workers who are paid by the County Government.</p>
      <p>He accused the county executive of overpricing projects citing the Dandora Stadium construction which initially was estimated at Sh250 million but ended up costing the taxpayers a whooping Sh350 million.</p>
      <p>Guyo was replaced by Dandora III MCA Charles Thuo.</p>
      <p>Elachi resumed her duties as Speaker on October 9 after the court reinstated her.</p>
      <p>She had been ousted by MCAs in September 2018 by a faction led by Guyo.</p>
