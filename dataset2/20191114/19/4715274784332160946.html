      <p>He battles <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/hexigetu/">“Wolf Of The Grasslands” Hexigetu</a> in the curtain raiser of <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/age-of-dragons/">ONE: AGE OF DRAGONS</a> at the Cadillac Arena in Beijing, China this Saturday, 16 November. The pair were originally scheduled to face each other at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/dreams-of-gold/">ONE: DREAMS OF GOLD</a> in Bangkok last August, but after “The Bicolano” failed the hydration test the bout was removed from the card.  With the match right around the corner, the Filipino karateka is confident that he is more equipped for battle this time.  “I am really ready to fight. My training is continuous and I’m always excited and challenged for every opportunity. My diet is also better this time compared to Bangkok so expect that I am 100 percent ready this Sunday,” Gonzales said. “I’m ready to display a much-improved version of my game, from the ground up to my striking.” Winning his last three matches in an impressive fashion, the 32-year-old sees this match as a ticket to bigger things in 2020. Never the type to repeat mishaps, Gonzales vows to not let his supporters down.  “I always feel blessed each time I fight. It’s another opportunity for me and my family. The goal is to win because it would help me achieve the things that I am looking forward to,” Gonzales said.  “This is for everyone who has always believed in me. I want to show that I am working hard and that I won’t be wasting their support.”  The Filipino is aware of the dangers that Hexigetu presents, especially after the Chinese athlete scored a dominant decision win over  <a href="https://www.onefc.com/athletes/ovais-shah/">Ovais “The Enigma” Shah</a> at <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/warriors-of-light/">ONE: WARRIORS OF LIGHT</a> last May. The key for Gonzales is confidence in himself and believing in his months-long preparation for this moment.  “I don’t plan to get careless with Hexigetu when we face each other,” Gonzales said.  “I am more determined to get this in my second chance. Confidence, my mind, and my hard work in training will be the keys to victory for me.” ONE Championship returns this Saturday, 16 November for <a href="https://www.onefc.com/events/age-of-dragons/">ONE: AGE OF DRAGONS</a> in Beijing, China.  The prelims start on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONEChampionship/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/onechampionship">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OneFCMMA">YouTube</a>, and the <a href="https://www.onefc.com/download-app/">ONE Super App</a> at 5:00pm Philippine Standard Time (PHT). The main card starts at 6:30pm.  Also, ABS-CBN S+A will show the main card on a same-day delay at 11:00pm PHT.</p>
