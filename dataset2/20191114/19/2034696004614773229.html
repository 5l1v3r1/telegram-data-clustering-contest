      <p>The Amazon Prime special will also include dance performance by the Radio City Rockettes and a cameo from Kendall Jenner.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Musgraves added: “I can say without a doubt that this project is unlike anything I’ve ever done before. What started as the small seed of an idea one night over a year ago has turned into something I’m so proud of.</p>
      <p>“Some truly brilliant comedic and musical guests are featured in the show — as well as my own grandma. My vision was to bring my old Christmas album to life visually and create a modern and fashionable, fresh take on a classic format. It’s a nostalgic, Wes Anderson-inspired reimagining of the holidays. It’s heartfelt, funny, and most of all, real. I can’t wait to finally share.”</p>
