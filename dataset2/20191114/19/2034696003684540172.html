      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> have signed a licensing deal with Paramount Pictures to make the fourth movie in the <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> franchise, it is being reported.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Starring Eddie Murphy as Detroit police Detective Axel Foley, the buddy cop franchise began in 1984, with the third and final movie released in 1994.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/beverly-hills-cop-4-lands-at-netflix"><i>JoBlo</i></a>, Paramount Pictures, which owns the rights to the franchise, has made a one time licensing deal with Netflix for the streamer to make <i>Beverly Hills Cop 4.</i> The agreement is also said to include an option for a fifth movie with Jerry Bruckheimer set to produce.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/eddie-murphy-planning-make-beverly-hills-cop-4-after-coming-to-america-sequel-2553479">Murphy said he was planning on making <i>Beverly Hills Cop 4</i></a> once work on <i>Coming To America 2</i> is complete.</p>
      <p>“We’re doing <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> and then the plan is to get back on stage and do stand-up,” he told Collider, before reiterating <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/eddie-murphy-return-to-stand-up-touring-in-2020-2545444">his plans to return to stand-up.</a></p>
      <p>“That’s what I’ll be doing mostly is stand-up. These movies and <i>Saturday Night Live</i> [Murphy will guest host in December], it’s kind of like… I’m looking at it as a bookend. If I decided I wanted to stay on the couch forever, I ended it on a funny note.”</p>
      <p><i>Beverly Hills Cop 4 </i>currently has no script, director, or release date, and there’s no word on whether Judge Reinhold will return as Detective Billy Rosewood.</p>
      <p>Murphy’s latest movie, <i>Dolemite Is My Name</i>, is also currently streaming on Netflix.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/eddie-murphy-hints-retirement-movies-2563189">Eddie Murphy has hinted that he’s set to retire from movies.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking in a new interview, he said that he feels most comfortable on stage performing stand-up comedy, and that it won’t be long before he gives up acting<i>.</i></p>
