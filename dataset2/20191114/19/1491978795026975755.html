        <i>British inventor Richard Browning has broken his own record for the fastest flight in a jet suit. The self-proclaimed 'Jetman' took off from Brighton beach, attempting to break his own previous record of 32mph, set in 2017. He  reached 85mph, more than 50mph faster than his previous record. Browning said before the flight he was hoping to show how the technology used in the suit had progressed since the previous record was set</i>
