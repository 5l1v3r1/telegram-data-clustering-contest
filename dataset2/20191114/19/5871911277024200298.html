      <p>Primetime games are great, but being played at night, it can sometimes draw the wrong types of fans — you know, the ones that drink a bit too much, and attend only 1-2 games per season.</p>
      <p>That may have been the case for Monday’s Seahawks-49ers game at Levi’s Stadium, as it was noticed that someone (or a group of people) ripped the facemask off the Joe Montana statue.</p>

      <p>It didn’t take long for the fan to get caught, though. And we even have video of it.</p>
