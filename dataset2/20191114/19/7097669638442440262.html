      <h1>GOP Rep. Steve King suggests George Soros' son is the whistleblower, which makes no sense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:09:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Krawczyk</a></address>
      <p>Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is getting his conspiracy wires crossed.</p>
      <p>The congressmember is among the far-right crowd publicly speculating on the identity of the whistleblower who exposed President Trump's questionable Ukraine dealings, despite the fact that <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/876755/donald-trump-jr-condemned-tweeting-alleged-whistleblowers-name-despite-death-threats">outing a whistleblower</a> could put them in danger. Then again, King's Thursday guess of the whistleblower's identity couldn't be further from correct.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/IAStartingLine/status/1195056985210789895">since-deleted tweet</a>, King cited Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who has repeatedly said he doesn't know the identity of the whistleblower. King then provided Schiff with "four strong clues" apparently revealing his perceived whistleblower with Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Except the man in all four pictures is Alexander Soros, the son of the billionaire liberal donor George Soros that Republicans <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/811191/how-george-soros-became-bogeyman">detest so much</a>.</p>
      <p>Not only does Soros have no job in the federal government nor any intelligence experience, but King fails to realize it would be very odd if Trump let one of his staunchest political enemies work for him in the White House.</p>
