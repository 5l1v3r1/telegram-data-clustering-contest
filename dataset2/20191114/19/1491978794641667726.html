        <i><b>Friday:</b> Kurdish Iranian journalist who was held on Manus Island for six years reaches New Zealand. Plus, conservationists vote bird into top spot</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 15 November.</p>
      <h3>Top stories</h3>
      <p><b>Behrouz Boochani, the Kurdish Iranian journalist who became the voice of Manus Island refugees, is free.</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/behrouz-boochani-free-voice-manus-island-refugees-new-zealand-australia">After arriving on Thursday evening in New Zealand</a>, the tireless advocate and award-winning author vowed “never to go back to that place” – Australia’s immigration regime on Papua New Guinea, with either the US or NZ as possible long-term destinations. Held on Manus Island for six years – or 2,269 days –Boochani secretly documented life inside the facility, where he witnessed fellow refugees shot, stabbed and murdered by guards, saw several die through medical neglect and watched others descend into mental anguish and suicide. His journey out, organised over months and supported by UNHCR and Amnesty International, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/a-long-flight-to-freedom-how-refugee-behrouz-boochani-finally-left-his-island-jail-behind">took 34 hours and crossed three countries</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Queensland remains under severe bushfire threat</b>,<b> </b>with the state so dry that thunderstorms forecast at the weekend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/lightning-strikes-likely-to-spark-fires-as-thunderstorms-forecast-for-tinder-dry-queensland">could bring lightning but no rain</a>. Emergency services were able to build stronger containment lines around many of the 75 bushfires burning across the state on Thursday, but dry storms and a continued heatwave in the south-east are expected to exacerbate conditions. The Bureau of Meteorology has little good news on the horizon, with Richard Wardle telling media: “We’ve had a very dry 2019 and we expect those very dry conditions to continue until 2020.”</p>
      <p><b>Nancy Pelosi has accused Donald Trump of bribery</b>, saying the president’s actions in seeking to cover his tracks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/nov/14/trump-news-today-live-impeachment-hearings-ukraine-democrats-roger-stone-latest-updates">make “what Nixon did look almost small”</a>. On another bruising day of live hearings, the speaker of the House of Representatives chose not to mince her words: “To grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections. That’s bribery.” Meanwhile, two senior lawmakers from both parties are emerging as chief nemesis and defender of the president– <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/adam-schiff-devin-nunes-impeachment-hearings-battle">the Democrat Adam Schiff and the Republican Devin Nunes have taken centre stage</a> during the impeachment proceedings thus far. Rudy Giuliani also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-insurance-loyal">joked via telephone with the Guardian that he has “very good insurance”</a> should the president turn on his personal lawyer.</p>
      <p><b>The black-throated finch has been voted Australian bird of the year for 2019</b>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/black-throated-finch-wins-2019-bird-of-the-year-as-tawny-frogmouth-comes-second">beating the tawny frogmouth</a><b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/black-throated-finch-wins-2019-bird-of-the-year-as-tawny-frogmouth-comes-second"> </a></b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/black-throated-finch-wins-2019-bird-of-the-year-as-tawny-frogmouth-comes-second">in a landslide</a>. The highly endangered finch, which is under threat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/adani-mine-could-snuff-out-black-throated-finchs-last-chances-of-survival">from the Adani Carmichael coalmine</a>, was backed by a highly organised online campaign linking it to deforestation, the climate emergency and opposition to the mine. It won with 11,153 votes<b> </b>(35% of the total), 7,802 votes clear of second place. Overall, including first- and second-round votes, 18,387 people voted for the black-throated finch. The tawny frogmouth briefly held hopes of becoming the first nocturnal bird to win the poll but came a distant second with 3,351 votes. The magpie, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/11/magpie-edges-out-white-ibis-and-kookaburra-as-australian-bird-of-the-year">won the inaugural Guardian/BirdLife Australia 2017 bird of the year</a>, slumped to fourth with 2,725 votes<b>,</b> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/14/bin-chickens-carve-a-warm-spot-in-australias-heart-even-as-they-raid-and-thieve">ibis</a>, which came second in 2017, dropped all the way to 10th, with only 1,147 votes. The superb fairy-wren<b> </b>came third, with 2,875 votes, the magpie fourth (2,725) and the<b> </b>laughing kookaburra fifth (2,650).</p>

      <p><b>It’s 3pm on a weekday and, if anyone’s going to end up at Sexpo, it’s Brigid Delaney. “</b>A handful of us are pressed against a barrier, clapping a woman who just stuffed a three-foot (inflated) balloon down her throat. It just disappeared down her gullet and is now presumably entangled in her lower intestines like one of those seabirds that has swallowed a plastic bag.” At the intersection of the sex toy industrial complex and a sort of “Royal Easter Show for adults”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/14/giant-dildos-and-vibrating-beds-sexpo-is-serious-about-the-business-of-sex-its-also-hilarious">Sexpo is nothing if not eye-opening</a>. But more than that, writes Delaney, it’s completely hilarious.</p>
      <p><b>As land prices spiral globally, the appeal of tiny houses continues to rise. </b>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/15/never-too-small-the-aspiration-and-nauseation-of-micro-apartments">as Wendy Syfret writes</a>, with residences ranging between 22 and 40 square metres, they’re a “curious mix of aspirational and off-putting: part of you wants to live in these dreamy matchboxes, another wonders how anyone could.” An Australian YouTube show, Never Too Small, has become a viral global hit but, with city planning regulations dragging behind, can any of this ever become a reality in modern Australia?</p>
