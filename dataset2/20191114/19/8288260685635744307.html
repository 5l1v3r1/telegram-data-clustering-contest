      <p>Birmingham and Cardiff City have been fined by the Football Association for failing to control their players during the recent Sky Bet Championship clash between the clubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham</a> were fined £7,500 and Cardiff £5,000 after both clubs admitted the charge.</p>
      <p>Cardiff accepted the standard penalty, while Birmingham requested a hearing.</p>
      <p>The sanctions <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-cardiff-city-hit-17209991">relate to an incident that occurred towards the end of the match</a> at the Cardiff City Stadium on November 2.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Birmingham defender Harlee Dean was shown a red card in the third minute of added time for elbowing Joe Ralls, who scored a hat-trick in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-cardiff-live-reaction-17176413">Cardiff's 4-2 victory</a> , in an aerial duel.</p>
      <p>Blues' <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-discover-harlee-dean-17210623">appeal to overturn the sending-off was unsuccessful</a> , with Dean currently serving a three-match suspension.</p>
      <p>Following the clash, a melee ensued involving the two sets of players. Earlier in the game, Cardiff striker Danny Ward was also sent off.</p>
