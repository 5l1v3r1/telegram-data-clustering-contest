      <h2>Woman used hyaluronic acid for filler injections</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - A German Instagram influencer has been sentenced to four years in prison for conducting illegal beauty treatments.</p>
      <p>Michael Rehaag, a spokesperson at the district court in Bochum, told CNN the 29-year-old woman confessed to injecting hyaluronic acid as "filler" into the lips and noses of at least 35 women.</p>
      <p>The pregnant social media star, who cannot be named under German privacy law, had 100,000 <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/14/tech/instagram-hiding-likes-globally/index.html">Instagram</a> followers, Rehaag told CNN.</p>
      <p>She used the social media platform to advertise her services between 2017 and April 2019, charging between 300 and 450 Euros ($330 to $495) for the injections, which she initially carried out in her living room.</p>
      <p>Later, treatments were carried out in hotel suites "where one room was used as a treatment room and the other as a waiting room for clients," Rehaag said.</p>
      <p>"The court also learned that some treatments were carried out in a private room at discotheques."</p>
      <p>He added: "The presiding judge said that the term 'hygiene ordinance' was an unknown to the woman. Basic measures in this area which are absolutely necessary and unavoidable have been disregarded here -- such as wearing gloves, wearing a surgical mask, using disinfectants."</p>
      <p>The court heard of at least 35 cases, and prosecutors said there are probably more.</p>
      <p>"Many of her clients later complained of complications after their procedures, which ranged from swelling and dents,'' Rehaag said.</p>
      <p>The woman's gross payment was estimated to be about $500,000.</p>
      <p>The influencer was also ordered to repay around $73,800 in unpaid taxes.</p>
      <p>She has been temporarily released from prison to give birth before serving the rest of her sentence, Rehaag confirmed.</p>
      <p>A second trial at the Bochum district court is currently underway against the woman's cousin, who is facing similar charges.</p>
