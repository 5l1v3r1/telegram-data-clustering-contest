      <p>A little panda has been captured on video while biting its fellow bear. The adorable little teddy apparently wanted a piece of bamboo, but while trying to snatch the leaves, it only wound up biting its friend's paw.</p>
      <p>The hilarious video received more than 20,000 views in just four hours.Â </p>
