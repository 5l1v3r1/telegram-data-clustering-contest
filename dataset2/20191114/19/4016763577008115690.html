      <h1>All Access With Macy’s: Rotimi Talks Personal Style &amp; Balancing Acting and Singing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:05:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Stacy Aguilar</a></address>
      <p>Whether you know him from his role as Andre Coleman on <i>Power</i> or for songs like <a href="https://genius.com/Rotimi-love-riddim-lyrics">“Love Riddim,”</a> Rotimi is clearly a star on the rise. The Nigerian-American actor, singer, and model grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey where he honed his love for singing. He’s been dropping mixtapes since 2011, but things have really heated up for him in the past few years.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Rotimi dropped <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Rotimi/Jeep-music-vol-1"><i>Jeep Music, Vol. 1</i></a> and this year he followed-up with <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Rotimi/Walk-with-me"><i>Walk With Me</i></a>. The latter features his viral hit “Love Riddim,” which has over 8 million plays on YouTube and almost 15 million plays on Spotify. He recently teamed up with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Akon">Akon</a> for a remix of the track and he’s busy cooking up even more new material.</p>
      <p>We caught up with Rotimi in-between shooting scenes for <i>Coming 2 America</i> to talk about balancing his acting &amp; music careers and his personal style. While doing the interview, Rotimi got to work with Macy’s Fashion Office who outfitted him in the Macy’s Holiday Party capsule, which draws inspiration from luxury fabrics and bold prints and includes everything from sequin jackets to patent leather loafers and brocade puffer jackets.</p>

      <p>
        <b>When did you first discover music?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I discovered music when I was four years old. I was a Nigerian wedding singer. My mom was my first manager, so she was the first one to embrace who I am as an artist. I grew up listening to <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Bob-marley">Bob Marley</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Fela-kuti">Fela Kuti</a>. It was an authentic, organic, cultured music background. I played the violin, the flute, the piano, and I learned about my craft at an early age. My mom believed in what was as an artist and knew that I had a lot of gifts, she wanted to hone that.</p>
      <p>The maroon is really cool. I like different vibes, different colors. I love to think I look like royalty.<br/>— Rotimi</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was it like growing up in New Jersey?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I grew up in a Nigerian household, so it was very structured, disciplined, but also really tough because it bred excellence. I had to work hard for everything. Everything was about going to an Ivy League school, everything was about being the top of your class. I took that and applied it to my work ethic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Now we’re in New York—home of the iconic 34th Street Macy’s store. Growing up, did you ever visit that store?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I actually did a fashion show there two years ago and it was kind of crazy. I had a good time, it was cool fits. It was a fall collection that they had. And I did a whole fashion show with Macy’s.</p>

      <p>
        <b>So how do you feel about being styled and being here with Macy’s now?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> It’s cool whenever you can link with something that’s legendary. I just want to continue to grow and continue to make it happen where these big brands and big companies want to be a part of my life and my style.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How would you describe your personal style?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I think it’s whatever fits and feels good. I think we make things work when you just have a good eye for what’s fly. I’ll treat myself to a couple of pieces here and there. Plus, I have a dope stylist. I like fitted shirts, where you can kind of button it down a little bit. I like nice, dope jackets. For me it’s whatever it looks good. Whenever I see something I like, I go from there and pick it. There’s no set style for me.</p>
      <p>Akon came to my show in Atlanta like three months ago and he was so inspired that he jumped on stage.<br/>— Rotimi</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you feel like your music influences your style, or vice versa?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I think my music is very sexy, so I try to do what I do. I try to be the Mr. Butterscotch himself, I think it kind of correlates a lot. It’s very sexual and very sensual.</p>
      <p>
        <b>During your styling session with Macy’s Fashion Office, what looks do you feel best represent your style?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> The maroon is really cool. I like different vibes, different colors. I love to think I look like royalty. This is my time, with the kings suit, with sequins, the different yellows, the golds, and everything royal. I’m like a chameleon when it comes to style, I try to be as fluid and different as possible.</p>

      <p>
        <b>You started officially releasing music in 2011. How do you feel like your music has evolved since then?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I feel like I learned who I was as an artist. I started figuring out what my vibe was. For a long time you try to be something you’re not in this industry. When you first start, you’re like, “Oh, Chris Brown does this, oh Trey Songz does this, oh, this person does that.” Then you finally find yourself. I found myself within the last few projects.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you ever see yourself making a holiday album?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> Oh, I do actually. A couple of years from now. Let me solidify everything else, but definitely want to do that.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What was your vision for your latest EP <i>Walk With Me</i>?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I wanted to create a project where it was a mixture of Craig David and Akon. I wanted to show who I am as an artist, show a little bit of what I grew up listening to, which is a little pop, R&amp;B, reggae, all of that in one project. I didn’t want to shy away from just being myself. I felt like a record like “Love Riddim” had embodied all those things. Like it was a mixture of a pop sound, a R&amp;B sound, and something that brought the Akon vibe.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Then you got global superstar Akon to hop on the remix of “Love Riddim.” How did that come about?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> Akon came to my show in Atlanta like three months ago and he was so inspired that he jumped on stage. Before that, we went to the club together. We knew there was a synergy there. He came to the show and loved the show, and he said, “I got to get on this record.” He was overseas somewhere, he sent his files over, and we just went crazy.</p>

      <p>
        <b>You’re on a great show, <i>Power</i>, which has such a cultural impact. How are you juggling acting and music?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> When people recognize you for just being talented, that’s a gift. When people stop you, and you changed their life or you changed their mood or you have a song that makes them dance, that’s all you can really ask for as a talent. I have to sacrifice a lot of my free time and just focus on who I am. In terms of balancing both, you just have to just go on full steam ahead. Not a lot of people are doing two professions at the same time, so I got to give it the proper time it needs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you prefer one over the other, or music or acting?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotimi:</b> I’d say music, because when you feel music, you can listen to your favorite song 5,000 times and watch your favorite movie five times. When you genuinely connect with people like that, people know you as a man and know you as an artist, it’s better than them knowing you as a character. You connect more with the music.</p>
