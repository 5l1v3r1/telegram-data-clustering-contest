      <p>Sun City - SA golfer <b>Zander Lombard </b>admitted that his local knowledge had helped him to a good start in the opening round of the <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Lombard recorded a 4-under 68 as he sits T4, trailing <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/NedbankChallenge/oosthuizen-battles-through-kidney-stones-to-take-sun-city-lead-20191114">leader</a> and fellow countryman Louis Oosthuizen by five shots.Â </p>
      <p>Despite only dropping a single shot on the 15th, Lombard used his expertise from playing on the Sunshine Tour to assert himself near the top of the leaderboard at Sun City.</p>
      <p>"I've played so many tournament rounds and social rounds around this golf course," Lombard told <b>Sport24</b>.</p>
      <p>"I think local knowledge around this tricky course really helps especially when it comes to wind direction, which comes off the valleys."</p>
      <p>Lombard revealed that he'd be eyeing a Top 10 finish and hopes that he continues with his form for the next three days.</p>
      <p>"I'm in a good position heading into the next day, I'm not going to force it and just let it happen," said the 24-year-old.</p>
      <p>"The goal is Top 8 or thereabout, I'm just going to play my game and see where it gets me. Hopefully I can go better the next three days."</p>
      <p>It is the first time at "Africa's Major" for Lombard and he explained how unreal it had been to tee off at the Gary Player Country Club.</p>
      <p>"It's been amazing, the endless support has been unreal," said Lombard.</p>
      <p>"The home supporters are the reason why we play this game, we are entertainers so it was amazing out there. It's great being here and it's a lovely atmosphere."</p>
      <p>Lombard is 76th on the Race to Dubai Rankings and needs to finish in the Top 3 in Sun City to see him qualify for the European Tour finale, the DP World Tour Championship.</p>
      <p>The Top 50 golfers on the Race to Dubai rankings will progress through to Dubai next week.</p>
      <p>Lombard gets his second round underway alongside four-time major champion Ernie Els and defending champion Lee Westwood at <b>10:39</b> on Friday.</p>
