      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:02:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alex-oxlade-chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> has been handed his first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> start in over 18 months after a serious injury ended his hopes of playing at last year's World Cup.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been included in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate's</a> starting line-up for Thursday's Euro 2020 clash with Montenegro at Wembley.</p>
      <p>He last featured among the starting XI for the Three Lions in a friendly with Italy back in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain looked a shoe-in to be included in the squad for the tournament in Russia, before suffering knee ligament damage in Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final with Roma on April 24, 2018.</p>
      <p>Southgate said at the time: "I think we’ve been quite clear in that he would have been in the starting XI for the World Cup had he been fit."</p>

      <p>He was ruled out for over year with his injury, and was recently dropped from the England set-up after limited appearances for his club side.</p>
      <p>But a recent bout of good form encouraged Southgate to re-select him, as he sees the midfielder as someone who can play a pivotal role in his side.</p>
      <p>“We’ve a huge belief in him,” said Southgate. “Whether it’s as a midfield player - where he’s excellent with or without the ball, provides a goalscoring threat, works hard for the team and presses well - or a wide player or a forward player, we’ve got huge belief in him."</p>

      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain was only welcomed back into the England fold in September, and came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>The England boss admitted he had brought Oxlade-Chamberlain back too early, with him only having played a handful of matches for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , and was left out of the October qualifiers.</p>
      <p>A run of four goals in three games for Liverpool prompted his inclusion in Southgate's latest squad though, who outlined his confidence in the player.</p>

      <p>"I felt in October, he had the message from us that we had faith in him, he just needed to go away and get playing more regularly so that he was coming into us ready to play," Southgate said.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s the key for us, you don’t want to be coming into an England camp short of match fitness because it’s then hard to go into the games and do yourself justice.</p>
      <p>"He looks like he’s on a really good path, he obviously had a long period out injured and it’s great to see him back playing and the goals he’s scored in the last few weeks have been exceptional.”</p>
      <p>Asked about Oxlade-Chamberlain before kick-off, Southgate said: "He’s a good player. He’s got speed, power, he's a goal threat.</p>
      <p>"His profile for that position, he’s able to press, which is what we're trying to do.</p>
      <p>"We’ve missed him."</p>
