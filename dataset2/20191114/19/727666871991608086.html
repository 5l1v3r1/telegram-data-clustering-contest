      <p>Jay-Z sold Rocawear for 207 million, and he just settled a lawsuit to get the rights to the brand back in his control.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Rapper Jay-Z has settled a nasty lawsuit with the company that bought his Rocawear brand.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/rapper-jay-z-sells-clothing-company-rocawear-for-204-million-in-cash-Tik09HZCM0iIG_GZvQkbOQ/">Iconix plunked down $204 million for the brand in 2007, but in 2013 executives wrote off the entire investment.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Jay-Z sued, claiming he was due money and had been victimized by a fraud scheme hatched by the executives at the company.</p>

        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/jay-z-argues-lack-of-racial-diversity-should-halt-arbitration-over-roc-trademark-FmkBksVbY022hG_kVWl0gg/">Jay-Z's lawyers also sued during the arbitration process, claiming there were not enough African-Americans involved in the process.</a>
      </p>
      <p>During the legal battle, the rap star/mogul was supposed to give a videotaped deposition, but he fought the order because he didn't want his testimony to leak.</p>
      <p>Jay-Z's lawyers protested, claiming his privacy was being invaded and that he was being subjected to a "Spanish Inquisition."</p>
      <p>According to reports, Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, bought back $15 million worth of intellectual property from Iconix as part of the settlement.</p>
      <p>Representatives for Jay-Z have yet to comment.</p>
