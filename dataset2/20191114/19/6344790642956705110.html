      <p><b><i>The Red Mother</i></b> is an upcoming comic series from author <b>Jeremy Haun</b> and artist <b>Danny Luckert</b> being published by BOOM! Studios. The story sounds pretty creepy in and of itself, and now there’s a creepy trailer to go along with the creepy synopsis.</p>
      <blockquote>There are dark things just beyond this reality. Horrors that we cannot quite see. Things wanting to get in. After losing her eye and the man she loves during a brutal attack in an alley, Daisy McDonough is left trying to put the pieces of her life back together. Just when she thinks she can start the process of healing and moving on, she begins to see strange things through her new prosthetic eye. <br/><br/>She can see the Red Mother. And the Red Mother can see her right back!</blockquote>
      <p><i>The Red Mother</i> #1 will be available on December 11 with print copies exclusive to local comic book stores. The main cover was created by Haun and a variant was created by Luckert.</p>
