      <h1>Sessions says if elected to the Senate he will be Trump's 'No. 1 advocate'</h1>

      <p>Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that if he wins back his old Senate seat in Alabama, he will be President Trump’s “No. 1 supporter.”</p>
      <p>Sessions, 72, left the Senate in 2017 to become the nation’s top law enforcement officer. He later drew the ire of Trump for recusing himself from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Fox News on Thursday, Sessions, who said it has “been some time” since he and Trump spoke, pointed out that he was an early backer of Trump and said he is still a firm supporter of the president.</p>
      <p>“I was his first supporter, but more than that, I was his No. 1 advocate for the issues he ran on,” Sessions said. “And if I go back to the Senate, I can tell you, I’ll be his No. 1 supporter in the Senate, and I will be his No. 1 advocate for the issues that he's talking about because they're the issues that average American cares about.”</p>
      <p>Sessions said he hopes Trump will support his candidacy.</p>
      <p>“I’m certainly going to hope that will happen, and he said he’s not going to attack me in the race,” he said. “We're taking our case to the people of Alabama, and they will decide who their next senator is. It’s not my seat; it’s the people’s seat in Alabama. That’s who I'll be asking.”</p>
