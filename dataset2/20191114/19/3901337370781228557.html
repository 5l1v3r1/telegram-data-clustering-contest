      <p>The Swansea City attacker will don the armband in Cape Coast this evening as Kwesi Appiah’s side seek another win over South Africa, with Bafana last beating them in a competitive fixture back at the 2000 AFCON.</p>
      <p>Ayew is likely to play a big role for the Ghanaians if they are to pick up three points in the opening game of this year’s qualifiers, insisting that it’s becoming tougher against African opponents in recent years as the quality improves.</p>
      <p>As quoted on Ghana’s official website, ‘Dede’ said, "Football is increasingly becoming difficult on the African continent, and the qualification process won't be all rosy. We will encounter tough challenges but we are determined to go through them and achieve our objective of qualifying.</p>
      <p>"The process begins with South Africa, which won't be an easy game but we are determined to give out our all and start on a very good note.”</p>
      <p>The GFA confirmed today that Lumor Agbenyenu is injured and has returned to Spain, with Joseph Attamah Larweh replacing him, while Christopher Antwi-Adjei, who had problems with his passport, won’t be considered for selection after only arriving in camp today.</p>
