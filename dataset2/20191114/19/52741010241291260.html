      <p>Cineplex Inc. shares rose about five per cent after the company reported record high revenue for its third quarter and outperformed analyst expectations, helped by a strong film slate including "The Lion King" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home."</p>
      <p>Shares in the movie theatre chain rose $1.14 or 4.94 per cent to $24.24 in early afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They reached a high of $24.99 earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>The jump came as the company reported higher-than expected third-quarter profit and revenue.</p>
      <p>Cineplex reported Thursday that its third-quarter profit rose to $13.4 million or 21 cents per share this year compared with $10.2 million or 16 cents per share in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Revenue totalled $418.4 million, up 8.3 per cent from $386.4 million, as theatre attendance increased 1.8 per cent due to what Cineplex called a stronger film slate compared with last year.</p>
      <p>CEO Jacob Ellis said on a conference call with analysts Thursday that the result marked a "record total revenue" for the company.</p>
      <p>Analysts on average had expected Cineplex to report a profit of 14 cents per share and $418 million in revenue, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Box office revenue grew to $177.9 million compared with $173.3 million a year ago, which RBC Dominions Securities analyst Drew McReynolds wrote in a note was "slightly lower than expected." RBC estimated it would be $181 million.</p>
      <p>In addition to The Lion King and Spider-Man, Cineplex attributed the strength to films such as "Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw," "It Chapter Two" and "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."</p>
      <p>The current quarter was also off to a good start, said Ellis, largely due to the success of "Joker," which has become the highest grossing film to open in October, reaching $316 million in domestic box office to date.</p>
      <p>Ellis said the line up for the remainder of the year was strong, highlighting "Ford v Ferrari," "A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood," "Frozen 2" and "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker."</p>
      <p>In addition to the improvement at the box office, Cineplex said food services revenue totalled $125.6 million, up from $115.6 million.</p>
      <p>Media revenue rose to $43.4 million compared with $33.5 million a year ago, while amusement revenue increased to $58.1 million compared with $53.8 million. Other revenue, which includes the Cineplex Store, promotional activities, screenings, private parties, corporate events and other items, rose to $13.6 million compared with $10.6 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>"These positive results are a great example of how our diversified businesses continue to build scale and make more meaningful contributions to our bottom line," Ellis said.</p>
      <p>The results come as Cineplex faces growing competition from streaming services.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, The Walt Disney Company launched its new subscription platform, Disney Plus. The Canadian offering spans nearly 500 films and 7,500 TV show episodes.</p>
      <p>Disney Plus is the latest entrant to an increasingly packed streaming space. Its competitors in Canada include Netflix, Bell Media's Crave service, Amazon's Prime Video and Apple's TV Plus.</p>
      <p>Ellis said the industry has faced disruptions over the years including VHS, DVD, the internet and now streaming.</p>
      <p>"But time and time again, over the past 30-plus years, moviegoing has long excelled amid changes in the industry," he said.</p>
      <p>When there's great content available, consumers want to see the film in the way it was intended: on the big screen with great sound and amenities, he said.</p>
      <p>That's why the company remains focused on offering viewers an experience that can't be replicated at home, he said, such as through IMAX, 3D and other types of viewings.</p>
