      <h1>Apple News+ failing to attract new subscribers after March launch, report says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:43:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Apple News+ debuted in March, and Apple was quick to tout that the service <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/apple-news-user-signups/">attracted over 200,000 subscribers</a> at that time. A new report from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/apple-news-has-struggled-to-add-subscribers-since-march-launch.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain"><i>CNBC</i></a> today details that since then, Apple has struggled to add Apple News+ subscribers.</p>
      <p>The report cites people familiar with the matter and says that the number of Apple News+ subscribers hasn’t “increased materially from its first couple days.” What’s also unclear is how many of those 200,000 initial subscribers converted from the free trial to paying customers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/30/apple-news-plus-uk/">Apple News+ recently expanded</a> to the United Kingdom and Australia. It’s unclear what effect those launches had on subscriber numbers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/14/bloomberg-apple-media-bundle/"><i>Bloomberg</i> reported this morning</a> that Apple is looking at bundling Apple News+, Apple TV+, and Apple Music together. In that report, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> is quoted as saying Apple News+ revenue has been “consistent with our expectations.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <i>CNBC’s</i> report quotes an anonymous publisher who has been disappointed with Apple News+ revenue:</p>
      <blockquote>For every subscriber of News+, Apple takes 50% of the revenue. The publishers split the other half based on time spent reading their content. One publisher told CNBC that his company received between $20,000 and $30,000 per month from Apple News+, a number far lower than it had initially expected.</blockquote>
      <p>Another publisher cited by <i>CNBC</i> says that revenue growth has been “lower than anticipated” from Apple News+, but advertising revenue from the free version of Apple News “has slowly but consistently climbed.”</p>
      <p>Bundling Apple News+ with TV+ and Apple Music would likely attract more subscribers to the service, but a lot of it would depend on how low Apple could get the monthly price of the bundle. Apple is said to have negotiated new terms with News+ publishers for the bundle, which could be announced as soon as 2020.</p>
