      <h1>Mike Bezzeg returns after 35 years with YouTube series InnerView</h1>

      <p>The Mike Bezzeg of 2019 looks very different than the Mike Bezzeg of 1984.</p>
      <p>This is hardly surprising, of course. But it’s notable because Bezzeg says he is still recognized from his days hosting FM Moving Pictures, a pioneering cable show he oversaw in Calgary for five years starting in 1979. Through this scrappy cable series, Bezzeg was responsible for exposing a generation of Calgarians to a brave new world of adventurous music, offering a pre-MuchMusic showcase that must have seemed enticingly novel in the 12-channel universe of the 1980s.</p>
      <p>But even before that, he had overseen the predecessor to FM Moving Pictures called Music in Review, which surely makes him Canada’s first “VJ.”</p>
      <p>Yes, both shows were on cable. Both had pocket-change budgets. Bezzeg was never paid for his work. But, anecdotally anyway, they seem to have had a surprisingly profound and far-reaching impact on a number of Calgarians of a certain age.</p>
      <p>“I still get recognized on a pretty regular basis,” says Bezzeg. “They always say ‘When are you going to do something else?’ “</p>
      <p>Thirty-five years later, he finally has an answer. This week, he premiered InnerView with Mike Bezzeg on YouTube. The Mike Bezzeg of the late 1970s and early 1980s had shaggy hair, big glasses and was prone to animated outbursts and surreal asides as host of FM Moving Pictures. In one humorous promo available on YouTube, he expressed doubts about the authenticity of Orville Redenbacher’s newly microwaveable popcorn while musing about Nash the Slash’s single, 1984.</p>
      <p>The Mike Bezzeg of 2019 wears a suit. His hair is shorn short and is now a distinguished grey-white. In general, his demeanour seems considerably calmer. The episodes provided to Postmedia included interviews with Calgary guitarist and producer Russell Broom, Olympic gold-medal swimmer Mark Tewksbury and electronic performer Tona Walt Ohama. All are thoughtful and in-depth and seem to to challenge the idea that YouTube is a medium geared toward short attention spans.</p>

      <p>We learn about the humble beginnings of Broom’s 15-year gig backing Jann Arden, why he once listened to Talk Talk’s Spirit of Eden every morning for a year and why he skipped the 2002 Juno Awards where he and Arden were awarded a Songwriter of the Year trophy for the songs Thing For You and Never Mind. We learn that Tewksbury’s first concert was a band he doesn’t particularly like, that ABBA’s Greatest Hits was the first LP he purchased and who he thinks is the most overrated artist of all time. We learn that Ohama’s father was born in Calgary’s Chinatown and was “a bit of a gangster” before becoming “the potato king of the world.” We also learn that Ohama, who remains relatively obscure in his home province but has a global fan base for his electronic music, has an affinity for prog-rock.</p>
      <p>Bezzeg’s small team for InnerView includes his 18-year-old son Christian and SAIT student Anthony Vespa, who operate the cameras. Still photographer David Kotsibie and editor and associate producer David Veitch, a former music critic and editor for the Calgary Sun, are also on board. The first season will run into February with new episodes every two weeks. It will feature an eclectic lineup that includes Calgary comedian Cory Mack, singer-songwriter Art Bergmann, Albuquerque-based alt-country husband-and-wife duo The Handsome Family, singer-songwriter Tom Phillips and veteran British psychedelic drummer Twink.</p>
      <p>“The difference between FM and this is not just the years that have gone by, but I’m only going to talk to people that I really like,” says Bezzeg, who would go on to spend decades working in sales for Sony before retiring. “I love Art Bergmann. At one point, we were walking around his place and he had his cane because he’s going through some medical issues. I said ‘Art, give me a hug.’ He gave me a hug like I haven’t had since I interviewed David Clayton-Thomas.”</p>
      <p>Bezzeg’s interview with Clayton-Thomas, the big-voiced Canuck crooner of Blood, Sweat and Tears, dates back to his pre-FM show Music in Review, where he also established relationships with artists such as Long John Baldry and Ronnie Hawkins in the early to mid 1970s.  But he says his first attempts at a being an interviewer began informally while he was on a bus heading home from visiting a friend in Kelowna around Christmas time. It was in 1967 and Bezzeg was only 12. One of his fellow passengers asked him if he wanted to chat, which they did for hours. Turns out it was Tony Joe White, a songwriter who would gain fame a few years later for penning Polk Salad Annie and Rainy Night in Georgia.</p>
      <p>After Music in Review fizzled out, Bezzeg began FM Moving Pictures in 1979 while working in local record stores. The freewheeling show would feature videos and interviews, but could also veer off into cheerfully strange territory. He once gave Iggy Pop and Nash the Slash free rein to interview each other, which made for an amusingly unhinged piece of cable television. In another episode, the late Nash the Slash, sporting a kaffiyeh and with his face wrapped in his trademark bandages, prepared Chicken Paprikash in Bezzeg’s kitchen that they later served to new-wave popsters the Spoons. He once interviewed Bob Geldof when the singer was in Calgary for a show with his Boomtown Rats and captured a great story about how the then punk-rocker inadvertently damaged Lawrence Welk’s piano during a raucous, lip-synched performance on an American television show. Well, he though he captured it. When they got back to Bezzeg’s house, It became distressingly clear that the audio hadn’t worked.</p>
      <p>Eventually, his reputation grew to a point where publicists were asking him to interview musicians passing through town.  </p>
      <p>Which brings us to another big difference between then and now. Bezzeg doesn’t hide his frustration about the fact he is getting used to publicists not returning his calls these days.</p>
      <p>“Nobody cares what you did 30 years ago,” he says.</p>
      <p>Still, he says the Internet offers endless potential and he is confident there is an audience out there for in-depth interviews of some of the most intriguing artists and public figures from Calgary and beyond.</p>
      <p>“In the person I’m interviewing, I just want to bring out their humanness, the person that they really are,” Bezzeg says. “Everybody puts up facades. I want that to come down and I want that person’s real personalities to come through.”</p>
