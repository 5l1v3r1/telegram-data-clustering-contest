      <p><b>NICOSIA, CyprusÂ (AP)</b> - Cyprus' president vowed on Thursday to press ahead with creating a national park in a largely untouched area of the tourism-reliant island, following a string of deliberately-set forest fires that were blamed on local landowners' development plans.</p>
      <p>Nicos Anastasiades tweeted that such actions only make authorities more determined to protect and rehabilitate the remote northwestern Akamas Peninsula.</p>
      <p>Anastasiades said any development "can and must" be in step with efforts to safeguard the peninsula's environmental value.</p>
      <p>Authorities say "premeditated arson attacks" on Wednesday burnt around 70 hectares (173 acres) of dense pine forest in the area.</p>
      <p>Authorities believe the fires may have been set by local residents who fear that declaring the area a national park will reduce property values and prevent land development.</p>
      <p>Environment Minister Costas Kadis told state-run Cyprus News Agency that authorities plan to step up patrols of the peninsula and use new tools such as drones to help monitor the area.</p>
      <p>He said the government's project for Akamas will include controlled entrances and rules governing visitors' activities, and will do away with the "anarchy" of the past.</p>
      <p>Plans to declare the peninsula a national park have been in the works for at least 15 years, but political wrangling and opposition from local landowners have delayed their implementation.</p>
      <p>Environment ministry officials say efforts are on course to declare the peninsula a park by 2022.</p>
