      <h1>Le Mans '66 review: Disney's motor racing epic 'nearly an endurance'</h1>
      <h2>Even a star turn from Christian Bale - complete with a British accent- can't quite make this Disney motoring epic set hearts racing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:34:43+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Hunneysett</a></address>
      <p>Burn rubber with Christian Bale and Matt Damon as they prevent this fleetingly thrilling motor racing epic from becoming an endurance.</p>
      <p>The story is driven by Bale’s loopy ­performance as real-life maverick racing driver and war veteran Ken Miles, and seeing the Batman star screaming “giddy up” in a volatile Brummie accent is a major joy.</p>
      <p>He teams up with Matt Damon’s Carroll Shelby, a legendary car mechanic and a bit of a cowboy, but not in the British sense.</p>
      <p>They’re hired by car magnate Henry Ford II who’s determined to build a car capable of beating those produced by rival ­manufacturer Enzo Ferrari, in the French 24-hour motor race marathon Le Mans.</p>
      <p>It’s 1966, and being an American movie you’d never know there was an international football tournament taking place in Europe that year.</p>

      <p>Although stereotypical Italians are the competition, the real villain is a duplicitous Ford executive who’s noticeably more camp than not just the drivers, but even Ken’s beer-drinking wife.</p>
      <p>Director James Mangold has made impressive box office crowd-pleasers such as 2005’s Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, and previously worked with Christian Bale in 2007’s ­excellent Western remake 3:10 to Yuma.</p>
      <p>It would have been far more interesting had Mangold succeeded in suggesting racing can be akin to a divine experience, and he could have renamed the film Chariots of Fire on wheels.</p>

      <p>But the nearest this comes to heavenly is in moving some of the less ­fortunate drivers closer to god.</p>
      <p>Beyond loss of life there’s nothing at stake except Ford corporate pride which isn’t something I’m invested in, and as soon as the gorgeous red Ferrari 330 ­sashayed on to the track I wanted the ‘wrong’ team to win.</p>
      <p>Petrolheads may love this macho peeing contest, but in a year where Disney has created live action remakes of classic ­animation, this feels very much like a retread of Pixar’s cartoon Car franchise.</p>
