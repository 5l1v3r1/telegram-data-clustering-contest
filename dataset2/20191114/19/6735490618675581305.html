      <h1>Taylor Swift Bombshell: Alleges Braun And Borchetta Won’t Let Her Perform Old Hits At AMAs — Unless She Agrees Not To Re-Record Them Next Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:38:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>Taylor Swift has just dropped a bombshell.</p>
      <p>In a tweet issued on Thursday afternoon, the 29-year-old singer alleges that Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun are blocking her from singing any of her old hits in a medley she’ll be performing when she’s named Artist of the Decade at the upcoming American Music Awards.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Borchetta sold his Big Machine label to Braun, who now owns the masters for all the music Swift recorded for the label (she left Big Machine for Universal Music Group in late 2018).</p>

      <p>Swift has been publicly feuding with Braun and Borchetta ever since the deal went through in July, and is now claiming that they’re also preventing her from using any of that music in an upcoming documentary about her that’s in the works for Netflix — letting the cat out of the bag about what’s up until now been a top-secret project.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been planning to perform a medley of my hits throughout the decade on the show,” she writes in a lengthy statement she shared with fans via Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun have now said that I’m not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I’m allowed to next year,” she writes.</p>
      <p>“Additionally — and this isn’t the way I had planned on telling you this news — Netflix has created a documentary about my life for the past few years,” she adds. “Scott and Scooter have declined the use of my older music of performance footage for this project, even though there is no mention of either of them or Big Machine Records anywhere in the film.”</p>

      <p>In addition, Swift further alleges that Borchetta is using this as leverage to prevent her from enacting her plan to re-record all the music she released via Big Machine, which she is legally allowed to do next year.</p>
      <p>“Scott Borchetta told my team that they’ll allow me to use my music only if I do these things: If I agree to not re-record copycat versions of my songs next year (which is something I’m both legally allowed to do and looking forward to) and also told my team that I need to stop talking about him and Scooter Braun,” she continues.</p>

      <p>“I feel very strongly that sharing what is happening to me could change the awareness level for other artists,” she continues. “The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you’ll be punished. This is WRONG. Neither of these men had a hand in the writing of those songs. They did nothing to create the relationship I have with my fans.”</p>
      <p>On that note, she’s asking her fans to step in and let Braun and Borchetta “know how you feel about this,” as Braun “manages several other artists who I really believe care about other artists and their work.” (Braun manages Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato.)</p>
      <p>“Please ask them for help with this,” Swift implores her fans. “I’m hoping that maybe they can talk some sense into the men who are exercising tyrannical control over someone who just wants to play the music she wrote.”</p>
      <p>ET Canada has reached out to a rep for Borchetta, who had no comment.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long for Swift’s furious fans to spring into action and unleash a social media onslaught; within minutes of Swift’s tweet the hashtag #IStandWithTaylor became the top-trending hashtag on Twitter, while #FreeTaylor is trending at number three.</p>
      <p>Here’s a sampling of what Braun and Borchetta have to look forward to:</p>
