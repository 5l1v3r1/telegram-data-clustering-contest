      <h1>'It was always on the edge of an explosion' - ex-Forest boss on England spat</h1>
      <h2>Steve McClaren endured difficult spells in charge of England and Nottingham Forest</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:42:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Former Nottingham Forest manager Steve <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-live-roy-keane-3411910">McClaren</a> believes the England team has always been on the verge of an "explosion" and admits he wasn’t surprised to see fireworks go off this week.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez were involved in a showdown at St George’s Park on Monday, just hours after Manchester City were beaten by Liverpool at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The pair were involved in an angry confrontation on Merseyside, before picking up where they left off after joining up with Gareth Southgate’s Three Lions for their upcoming games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/nottingham-forest-loan-goalkeeper-aro-3306942">Sterling</a> was stood down from Thursday night’s Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro at Wembley, but not removed from the squad entirely, and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/steve-mcclaren-tough-time-nottingham-2351194">McClaren</a> , who took charge of the national team between 2006 and 2007 believes it was anything but a shock.</p>

      <p>“International management is very difficult, especially with England. It was always a difficult atmosphere.</p>
      <p>“It was always on the edge of an explosion and they’ve had one,” he told talkSPORT.</p>

      <p>“There’s been many more and we all have spats.”</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez are both chasing the Premier League title at their respective clubs, and the former Reds chief admits that club rivalry is often bubbling away in the background.</p>
      <p>"Conflicts within the international squad can occur because of the rivalry between the clubs on the field which you can’t get away from,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes they can be underlying and never come out.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s good that it’s come out.</p>
      <p>“Conflict can be a great opportunity to stamp your authority to sort things out, to come closer together.</p>
      <p>“As long as Gareth handles that well, which he has done so far – the media are trying to explode that and make it bigger than what it is – they’ve handled it well.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see how they go forward from that.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little crack that needs to be sealed up.”</p>
