      <p>BRASILIA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Bolivia was on the brink of chaos and there was a power vacuum after Evo Morales resigned as president under pressure on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Brasilia at a BRICS summit, Putin said he hoped that whoever comes to power in Bolivia would continue to cooperate with Moscow.</p>
      <p>“A situation has arisen in which there is no authority at all,” Putin said. “The country is on the verge of chaos.”</p>
      <p>“Everything changes quickly in Latin America. Let’s hope that common sense will prevail.”</p>
      <p>Moscow has commercial interests in Bolivia where Russia’s state nuclear agency is building a nuclear center. Morales visited Moscow for talks with Putin as recently as June, pointing to Bolivian gas and lithium as areas for cooperation.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was ready to work with Bolivia’s interim leader, but stressed that she had come to power without having a full quorum in parliament.</p>
      <p>Jeanine Anez, the Bolivian Senate’s vice-president, stepped in as interim leader on Tuesday after Morales resigned in what Russia has compared to an orchestrated coup.</p>
      <p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry this week accused Bolivia’s opposition of unleashing violence that prevented Morales from completing his mandate.</p>
