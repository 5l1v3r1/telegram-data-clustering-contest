      <h1>Varcoe: Kenney considers royalty holiday to rejuvenate 'hemorrhaging' drilling sector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:21:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Varcoe, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Facing the prospect of another dismal year in 2020, Canada’s hard-hit drilling sector has asked the UCP government to look at new incentives to stimulate additional work in the oilpatch.</p>
      <p>And speaking at a luncheon of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC), Premier Jason Kenney said a number of ideas are being considered to keep the sector working.</p>
      <p>The province is “listening to the industry on what we can do to stimulate job-creating activity. CAODC and others have recommended, for example, a potential royalty holiday on new drilling activity,” Kenney told the crowd.</p>
      <p>“Such concepts are under active consideration.”</p>
      <p>The suggestion comes as the association, which represents the country’s drilling and well-servicing companies, released a new forecast of activity levels in 2020, projecting another difficult year for the sector.</p>
      <p>The group expects 4,905 wells will be drilled across the country next year, up only nine wells from this year’s tepid levels.</p>
      <p>It’s a far cry from the 13,000 wells completed before oil prices collapsed five years ago, but it’s also off by a third from 2018 levels, before production curtailment was adopted by the province due to sagging Alberta crude prices and ongoing pipeline problems.</p>
      <p>Other industry forecasts have also been subdued, with the Petroleum Services Association of Canada recently predicting drilling levels will decline by 10 per cent next year, while some industry analysts believe the drop could be steeper.</p>
      <p>According to CAODC, the overall industry rig fleet is expected to keep shrinking, falling by nine per cent to about 500 rigs, as activity remains stagnant and more equipment and drillers head south. Since 2017, companies have moved 29 drilling rigs and crews into the United States.</p>
      <p>Employment across the sector next year will remain flat from 2019 levels, declining by almost 45,000 since 2014 as the drilling industry is in “dire straits,” said CAODC president Mark Scholz.</p>
      <p>“This industry is hemorrhaging, it’s a crisis,” Daniel Halyk, CEO of Calgary-based Total Energy Services Inc., told reporters after the event.</p>
      <p>“We need to see a sustained rejuvenation of the sector that will provide steady, predictable employment, or we will continue to see this industry die in this country.”</p>

      <p>Halyk noted that four years ago, less than four per cent of his company’s revenues came from outside Canada. So far this year, that number now stands at 61 per cent, reflecting higher levels of growth capital being invested in other jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>With government-mandated oil production limits extended into 2020, the province has taken steps to encourage growth and more capital spending by the sector, such as allowing producers to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/alberta-set-to-let-producers-hike-oil-output-if-companies-add-rail-shipments">exceed their monthly output caps</a> if they add incremental oil-by-rail shipments.</p>
      <p>It’s also exempting oil production from new conventional wells from the quotas. But with a weak outlook shaping up for the traditionally busy winter drilling season, the CAODC believe other steps are needed.</p>
      <p>It has asked the Kenney government to consider adopting a royalty credit to incent bigger drilling programs by petroleum producers, or a one-year royalty holiday on new wells, offering a break that would kick in immediately and expire at the end of June 2020.</p>
      <p>Scholz welcomed the province’s announcement last week that it will exempt new conventional oil wells from production limits, but noted petroleum producers that deploy additional capital in Canada are being punished by investors.</p>
      <p>“We believe the government needs to do something even further . . . that would further incentivize the deployment of capital, in particular in Alberta, to get drilling rigs back to work,” he said.</p>

      <p>Given the state of the sector, a royalty reduction would be more effective than other measures such as income tax relief, added Halyk.</p>
      <p>But it’s unclear what the response will be from producers, given commodity prices, curtailment and the current market conditions they’re facing.</p>
      <p>Tristan Goodman of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada said his group supports either incentive proposal and thinks it would stimulate more spending and jobs, although the degree of the effect needs to be determined.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for any incentive that will make or put Alberta back on the map from an investment standpoint. For us, it’s all about investment,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, adopting such a program during a period of budget restraint and cutbacks would be a hard sell for the government, particularly one that favours broad-based tax relief over one-off initiatives.</p>
      <p>During his speech, Kenney acknowledged the oilfield services sector has been hit hard in recent years, and he catalogued his government’s action on the energy front since winning the spring election, such as reducing municipal taxes for shallow gas producers and pushing for faster project approvals from the Alberta Energy Regulator.</p>
      <p>While the province will maintain production curtailment to protect the value of Alberta’s energy resources, with new pipeline capacity coming, “we believe that the path is clear, over the next year, to gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the need to use curtailment,” Kenney said.</p>
      <p>The province will also approach Ottawa about supporting flow-through shares, a capital-raising instrument, to accelerate abandoned well reclamation work and create oilfield services sector jobs while helping the environment.</p>
      <p>“Our goal is to do everything we can to incent new exploration and production while ensuring that we avoid the kind of catastrophic (price) differentials from which this province was suffering a year ago,” he added.</p>
