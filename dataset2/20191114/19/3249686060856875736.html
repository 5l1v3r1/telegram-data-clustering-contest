      <p>On November 12th, the father of the former '<b>Produce X 101</b>' contestant, Kang Hyeonsu, spoke up about the whole vote-rigging controversy surrounding the series.</p>
      <p>He spoke about his son's hardships in life, and that those behind the scandal should be punished.</p>
      <p>But surprisingly he asked for the members of the group <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/X1">X1</a>to stay together and not disband, stating that the members put in just as much hard work and the disbandment would only cause more chaos.</p>
      <p>What do you think? Do you agree with Hyeonsu's father?</p>

      <p>"<i>Hello.. I am the dad of 'Produce X 101' contestant Kang Hyunsu.. </i></p>
      <p>
        <i>I</i>
        <i>t's been a long time since I've posted and it's bringing back a lot of memories of my son during 'Produce X 101'!!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I've been seeing the debuting group X1 all around the news recently.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>My heart still aches to see the beloved colleagues to be the point of hate and being tested as soon as they stepped out into the society!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>To be honest, what would the kids know?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It's all responsibilities of the adults involved.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Although my child has gone through plenty of hardships since his debut when he was 18, it's the first time for some of these members, and it really breaks my heart seeing them like this because it reminds me of the past!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Currently my son Hyunsoo decided to compete in Korean-Japanese collaborated Idol program 'G-EGG 'with my permission.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It must be his last try this time right~??</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Anyways, the whole issue came from these adults, but to do something to X1 seems unreasonable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Their life depends on this..</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I think all of them have the charm and the skills to deserve it..</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Disbandment would bring more chaos!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I'm sure even the eliminated trainees will do well...</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Because they're all still in the national producers' hearts.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The adults that broke the law should definitely be punished!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And that will be justly decided by the judiciary.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The normal fans that are angry at this unfairness are the most just and logical people..</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I'm sure you will follow the investigation results and understand.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I'm writing this post as I cannot sleep while seeing that the investigation results will be announced tomorrow by the police..</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I really wish good luck to all of X1 after pushing through this and the rest of 'Produce X 101' contestants..</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And I really love all the 'Produce' fans..</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Sorry for posting at such a late time, <br/><br/>Hyunsu's dad."</i>
