      <h2>Unions say the offer still doesn't match the salaries paid by other rail firms or solve understaffing issues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:14:30+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Press Association, Nicole Morley</a></address>
      <p>The operators of the Tyne and Wear Metro system have hit out at drivers who have rejected a 15% pay rise.</p>
      <p>Nexus said it had made an "unprecedented" offer to members of the RMT and Aslef unions which would bring their salaries up to an estimated £46,000 by 2022.</p>
      <p>Drivers currently earn £37,985 a year and can top this up by working rest days.</p>
      <p>An industry source said the system was reliant on overtime and a number of drivers had left the Metro to work for other train operators for more money.</p>
      <p>Both unions balloted members who voted to turn down the offer and will take industrial action, likely to be an overtime ban on the tax-payer subsidised system, operated by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nexus">Nexus</a>, which links North Tyneside and Newcastle with Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland.</p>
      <p>Metro services director, Chris Carson, said: "We are about to start the process of transforming the Metro system with a new train fleet and as part of this we have made an unprecedented pay offer to our Metro drivers of a 15% increase in salary over two years, on top of the annual cost of living rise.</p>

      <p>"In return for this we are asking for some changes to working practices that will reduce the likelihood of trains being cancelled due to driver shortages, and help us with the once-in-a-lifetime task of introducing a new train fleet.</p>
      <p>"We're astonished that this offer has been rejected and that the trades unions not only want more pay, but also to work reduced shift lengths which can only be achieved by us employing significantly more drivers.</p>
      <p>"The trades unions have not made any suggestions as to where the money should come from to pay for this."</p>
      <p>An Aslef spokesman said: "We are disappointed that the company, which had indicated it would do its best to match drivers' salaries offered elsewhere on the rail network, and consequently stop the drain of drivers from Tyne &amp; Wear Metro, has decided, at the last moment, to come up short.</p>
      <p>"The company needs to get its act together, deliver on promises it made in private, and make sure it trains and retains the right number of drivers it needs to run the service it has promised passengers it will deliver.</p>
      <p>"The company is haemorrhaging staff and only the company can put that right."</p>
