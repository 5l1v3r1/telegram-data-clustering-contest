      <p>No. 2 Ohio State (9-0, 6-0 Big Ten, No. 2 CFP) at Rutgers (2-7, 0-6), Saturday at 3:30 p.m. EST (BTN).</p>
      <p>Line: Ohio State by 51</p>
      <p>Series record: Ohio State leads 5-0.</p>
      <p>WHAT'S AT STAKE?</p>
      <p>The 51-point spread is the largest for a Big Ten Conference game, according to several gambling organizations. Covering the historic margin should keep the Buckeyes in the No. 2 slot behind LSU and ahead of No. 3 Clemson. Expect Ohio State to keep the pedal down to stay sharp with No. 9 Penn State and No. 14 Michigan on tap for the final two games. Keeping it close and staying healthy would be wins for Rutgers, which has been searching for a head coaching replacement since firing Chris Ash on Sept. 29.</p>
      <p>KEY MATCHUP</p>
      <p>None. This is a mismatch at every position with the exception of maybe the punters.</p>
      <p>PLAYERS TO WATCH</p>
      <p>Ohio State: QB Justin Fields. Threw for three touchdowns and ran for another in the first half of a 73-14 win over Maryland. The Buckeyes had 705 yards of offense and 40 first downs. While averaging 206.6 yards passing in conference games, Fields is 144 of 211 for 1,859 yards with 27 touchdowns and one interception.</p>
      <p>Rutgers: RB Isaih Pacheco. After missing the Illinois game with an injury and getting a bye week, the sophomore is expected to play. He is seventh in the conference with 541 yards rushing on 123 carries (a 4.4-yard average) and has scored six touchdowns.</p>

Dobbins is second in the conference in rushing with 1,200 yards. He trails Jonathan Taylor of Wisconsin by 59 yards and has 42 fewer carries. ...
