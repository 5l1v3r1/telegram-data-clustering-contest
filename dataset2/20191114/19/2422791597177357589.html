      <h1>'Yes, I live in Canada': Photo of Ontario pizza delivery man's vehicle goes viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:06:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">Jackie Dunham, CTVNews.ca Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>A photo of a pizza delivery man’s unconventional vehicle has gone viral after the customer shared it online in what he described as a “quintessential” image of Canada.</p>
      <p>Adrian Azcurra said he was surprised to see a large sport utility vehicle with a glowing Domino’s Pizza sign atop it pull onto his snow-covered street in Collingwood, Ont., located north of Toronto, on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“I just ordered pizza and this tank of a vehicle rolled up,” he recalled to CTVNews.ca during a telephone interview on Thursday. “I hadn’t seen a truck like that on the road in a long time so I was like ‘I got to take a picture of this.’”</p>
      <p>Azcurra said a friendly conversation with the vehicle’s driver revealed the truck was a 1987 Dodge Ram Charger.</p>
      <p>“I was just kind of like ‘Hey, how is it driving this thing on the snow-covered roads? And he was like ‘It’s a beauty,’” Azcurra said.</p>
      <p>The pizza delivery man allowed Azcurra to snap a photo of the truck as it sat parked on the snowy street.</p>
      <p>Not long after the pizza delivery man left, Azcurra said he was sitting at home looking at the photo and he decided to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/dw441v/my_pizza_came_in_this_tonight_and_yes_i_live_in/">share it online on the social network Reddit</a>.</p>
      <p>“It was all kind of fitting,” he said. “I was like ‘You know, let me just throw this online’ because it’s kind of a quintessential image of Canada as the online community thinks Canada is all covered in snow and igloos and polar bears and all that stuff. I was kind of feeding into that by posting the picture.”</p>
      <p>That night, Azcurra uploaded the photo along with the caption “My pizza came in this tonight. And yes, I live in Canada.”</p>
      <p>As of Thursday afternoon, the post has already received more than 19,000 “upvotes” and more than 660 comments. Some users questioned the practicality of such a vehicle for a pizza delivery man, given the truck’s gas mileage, while others suggested the only thing that could make the scenario more Canadian was if the poster ordered Hawaiian pizza.</p>
      <p>“I did, much to my wife’s chagrin, order Hawaiian pizza last night,” Azcurra admitted with a laugh.</p>
