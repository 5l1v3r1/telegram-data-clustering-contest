      <p>As a composer and musician, her works include several Palaweño compositions, notably Cuyo Balitaw, Puerto Princesa Mabuhay, Palawan State University Hymn, and Martsa Cuyo.</p>
      <p>Her groundbreaking research on Ploning, a Cuyono folk song, was brought to national attention through Judy Ann Santos’ 2008 film by the same name. These songs then formed part of Palawan’s cultural portfolio.</p>
      <p>A true daughter of Cuyo, Palawan, Tria-Fernandez was a staunch advocate for the preservation of Palaweño indigenous culture and the Cuyono language, as well as the conservation of the Province’s flora and fauna, having published several books about these topics.</p>
      <p>She tirelessly served the former Department of Education, Culture and Sports in several capacities throughout her whole career in government, and used it as an avenue to immerse herself deeply into Palawan’s cultural milieu, for which she carried as her life’s goal to document and promote.</p>
      <p>Born on Sept. 20, 1929, she is a shining example of a life lived in full. Despite being twice orphaned at a young age and having survived a brutal war, she lived her life in perseverance, humility, and love, rising above adversity by dedicating her life to her passion for music and in genuine service to her beloved province. Her body of work stands as a timeless testament to such selflessness and dedication, where her legacy lives on forever.</p>
      <p>She follows her late husband, Jose Torres Fernandez, Jr. into the afterlife, having spent their lives in close tandem and partnership throughout their many academic and professional activities and works.</p>
      <p>She is succeeded by seven successful children and several grandchildren, along with numerous adopted children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Her remains lie at St. Peter Chapels in Baltan St., Puerto Princesa City. Interment will be on Nov. 17 after the 1 p.m.  Mass at Sta. Monica Parish.  Karl Fernandez Legazpi</p>
