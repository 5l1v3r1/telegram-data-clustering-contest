      <p>Like all riders,<b> Marc Marquez's day was marked by news of Jorge Lorenzo's retirement</b>. The current world champion attended today's press conference during which Por Fuera confirmed his retirement from professional racing. As well as a rival, <b>Marquez has also been Lorenzo's team-mate. Did he already know this was coming?</b></p>
      <p><i>“Honestly? I found out this morning </i>- he says -<i> <b>The news took me a little by surprise,</b> the team too. He's a person who always commits and it is also because of this commitment that we all saw at the Malaysian GP that we didn't expect this announcement”. </i></p>
      <p>
        <b>What made you doubt his possible retirement?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“<b>I saw him giving it his all at Sepang,</b> as if it were the first race, and this says a lot about his personality. His decision to stop also says a lot about him: he's a champion”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What could have pushed him to make such a drastic decision at this time?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He saw that <b>victory was too far off and he lacked motivation, so he decided to stop. </b>Only a great champion can do that”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Honda must now find a new rider. Who might they choose?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Yes, we now have a free bike and it's a very important bike. Honda is also a little surprised, and needs to understand whether they want an experienced rider or prefer to give a youngster like my brother, the Moto2 world champion, a chance”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Would you prefer your brother to come straight onto the factory team or would you suggest he first races with Lucio Cecchinello's team?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>“It's not up to me -</i> he says -<i> <b>if he has to make that decision, I won't get involved.</b> Having won in Moto2, I can see him on either bike, he's well prepared but it's a very personal thing”. </i></p>
      <p>
        <b>Could Lorenzo's retirement affect bike development plans for 2020? </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Crutchlow, Nakagami and me <b>were more or less of the same way of thinking regarding the bike</b> and the team has been working in that way. I don't think Lorenzo's departure will alter the work path”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Any particular duels with Lorenzo that stick out in your memory?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I've had so many with Jorge, having won and lost, I remember those I won best of all of course. One great victory was at Silverstone in 2013”. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think Jorge's decision is final or might he have second thoughts further down the line?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I think it's definitive, seeing as how he's gone about it. <b>Many riders would have had no qualms about continuing for another year in this situation, just to take the money home, </b>but he realised he couldn't win and so has stopped because he's a winner". </i>
