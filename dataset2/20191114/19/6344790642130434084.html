      <p>Director <b>Damien Chazelle</b> (<i>Whiplash</i>, <i>La La Land</i>)’s 1920’s set <b><i>Babylon</i></b> has been picked up by Paramount studios. The film, which is set to tell the story of the Golden Age of Hollywood, has <b>Brad Pitt</b> and <b>Emma Stone</b>circling two of the main roles. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/damien-chazelles-babylon-lands-at-paramount-brad-pitt-emma-stone-circling-1250753?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co">THR</a> provides a brief story synopsis and the main character descriptions:</p>
      <blockquote>The story is said to be set in the late 1920s, during the movie industry’s transition from silent films to talkies. The rise and fall of fictional and historical characters figure into the proceedings.<br/><br/>If deals are made, Stone would portray Clara Bow, the early sex symbol and box office star who was Hollywood’s first “It” girl. Pitt would play a fictional character, a silent film star who fails to make the transition to the new technology; sources say he is based on real-life figure John Gilbert.</blockquote>
      <p>Chazelle is a great storyteller, so I am all in on this film. I like the idea of a soft Tarantino-style film that gives us a fictional tale based in a time that really happened, with some of the real-life players. I’m hoping that it all works out for Pitt and Stone to join the cast for sure as well. <i>Babylon</i> is set to make a limited release on Christmas Day, 2021, with a wide release on January 7, 2022, so that it will qualify for the award season.</p>
      <p>Does this sound like a film you’d be into?</p>
