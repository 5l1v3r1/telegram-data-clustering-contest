      <h1>Boris Johnson appears to row back from Tory pledge to cut immigration</h1>

      <p>Boris Johnson has appeared to row back from a promise to cut immigration if the Tories are returned power in the UK's General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>The British Prime Minister said the Conservatives’ promised points-based immigration system “may” mean the numbers come down “in some sectors”.</p>
      <p>Earlier, however, Home Secretary Priti Patel said a Tory government would “reduce immigration overall”.</p>
      <p>At the same time ministers made clear they were finally abandoning the party’s long-standing commitment to get net migration down below 100,000 a year – a target they have never met.</p>
      <p>Ms Patel made the apparent commitment to cut overall immigration numbers in a Conservative press statement attacking Labour’s immigration policies.</p>
      <p>“We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors,” she said.</p>

      <p>Previously ministers had refused to say whether the Government’s proposals would lead to lower immigration.</p>
      <p>Initially, the Security Minister Brandon Lewis appeared to endorse the shift, saying a points-based system would give control to the Government “and we can then see immigration being reduced”.</p>
      <p>However, during a visit to a school in Kingston, Ms Patel declined to repeat the commitment to reducing the overall numbers.</p>
      <p>“We’re at early stages right now,” she told the PA news agency.</p>
      <p>“Because we’re in the middle of an election campaign as well there’s very, very limited things that I can say about the policy development.”</p>

      <p>And campaigning in Bristol, the Prime Minister also avoided any commitment to an overall cut.</p>
      <p>“We want to have a controlled system,” he said. “And yes, that may mean in some sectors immigration comes down.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mr Lewis said a Conservative government would not have an “arbitrary target” for immigration numbers as he admitted voters felt “let down” by their failure to deliver on the net migration commitment.</p>
      <p>“I recognise that people, including myself when I was immigration minister, have talked about reducing migration and net migration for years; we’ve not done that. That’s let people down,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have long faced criticism over the net migration target – the difference between the numbers coming in and the numbers leaving – set out by David Cameron in the party’s 2010 election manifesto.</p>
      <p>Critics said EU freedom of movement rules and the inability to control the numbers emigrating from the UK meant the Government had no real control over the net migration total.</p>
      <p>Mr Lewis said the failure to meet the target was in part because they had been in coalition with the Liberal Democrats from 2010 to 2015.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems hit back, accusing the Tories of seeking to arbitrarily cut immigration numbers without regard to the consequences.</p>
      <p>Home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: “Our public services, including our NHS, rely on the contribution that immigrants make but the Tories are willing to put this at risk just to pursue a nationalist Trumpian agenda.”</p>
