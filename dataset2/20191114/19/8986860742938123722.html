      <p>Netizens have descended heavily on Ghanaian female singer and songwriter Ethel Esi Eshun popularly known as eShun for recording a ‘profane’ song.</p>
      <p>Fans of the “Someone Loves Me” hitmaker are obviously not pleased with eShun’s new song dubbed “Koti Ma No”.</p>
      <p>eShun recently released the video of her new song and her fans are not happy about it since she is not known for producing such profane songs.</p>
      <p>Some fans advised the musician to desist from that and stick to her ‘good girl’ brand.</p>

      <p>Most of the musician’s fans are disappointed in her for switching from her decent brand to something which they believe is unacceptable.</p>
      <p>Recently, eShun revealed in an interview that she has switched to do danceable songs due to ‘hunger’.</p>
      <p>According to the musician, its now time to cash in on her talent, therefore, she has joined the trend and has stopped doing sensible songs</p>
