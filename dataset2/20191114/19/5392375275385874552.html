      <p>Chinese phone maker Lenovo gave us an official “first look” at the upcoming Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G. This comes in the form of a very unconventional unboxing video. Why unconventional? Well, the brand decided to completely blur out the device, which makes us wonder what’s the point of the entire video.</p>
      <p>In addition to that, the highly-skilled Lenovo video editing team managed to hide every possible interesting spec with the squeak of a duck. If you’re still willing to watch the video you can check it out at <a href="http://t.cn/AirNMNJN?m=4438528849245128&amp;u=1729866554">this link</a>.</p>
      <h3>Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G about to debut, here’s the first promotional video</h3>

      <p>The only real detail we learn from the video is that the smartphone will be really affordable. The <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/?s=Lenovo+Z6+Pro+5G">Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G</a> is thus going to be the cheapest 5G phone on the planet. In their words “It’ll break the industry with its ultra-low price”.</p>
      <p>Currently, the cheapest 5G-capable smartphone on the market is the Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G. The device had a launch price of 3699 Yuan (around $530), so we expect the Lenovo Z6 Pro 5G to cost less than that.</p>

      <p>Either way, from previous leaked rumors and some official data we have a somewhat clear idea of the hardware we’ll find on the device. Starting from the 6.39-inch display with a resolution of 2340 × 1080 and a notch: We’ll then find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU and four rear cameras. These will include a main 48MP camera, a 16MP ultra wide lens, an 8MP telephoto lens and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front we’ll instead have a 32MP selfie snapper.</p>
      <p>Connectivity wise, Lenovo’s flagship will support 5G with its integrated Qualcomm Snapdragon X50 5G modem. We’ll also have a 4×4 MIMO antenna and 256-QAM high-order modulation technology. The device will support 5G NR / LTE / WCDMA / GSM / CDMA networks.</p>
