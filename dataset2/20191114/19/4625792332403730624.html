      <p><i>The View </i>hosts accused Republicans of a double standard for dismissing the testimony during the recent impeachment hearing as "hearsay" while also impeaching Bill Clinton in the 1990s with "hearsay."</p>
      <p>"It’s also insane to me they kept on saying this is hearsay, this is hearsay, this is hearsay," host Sunny Hostin said Thursday on the show. "Well, Linda Tripp, remember Clinton was impeached because of Linda Tripp’s testimony which was complete hearsay. She was on a phone call which was taped."</p>
      <p>Host Joy Behar agreed with Hostin, saying, "Well she was not under the desk with Monica [Lewinsky], let's put it that way. So, that's hearsay."</p>
      <p>The criticism from the hosts came as Rep. Jim Jordan tore into witnesses William Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, State Department official in charge of Ukraine, for giving "hearsay" testimony. "I've seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this," the Ohio Republican told Taylor.</p>

      <p>House Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democratic-impeachment-push-goes-on-public-trial">held the first public impeachment</a> hearing Wednesday with Taylor and Kent. Trump dismissed the hearings, saying <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/schiff-cant-do-his-own-questions-trump-knocks-democrats-for-using-lawyer-during-impeachment-hearing">he did not even watch</a> the proceedings and instead opted to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.</p>
      <p>Tripp was a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/linda-tripp-blowing-the-whistle-on-the-lewinsky-scandal-had-nothing-to-do-with-politics">key witness in the Clinton</a> impeachment saga. She recorded conversations between the president and White House intern Monica Lewinsky, who Clinton was having an affair with. Clinton was impeached by the House in 1998 but was later acquitted by the Senate on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.</p>
