      <p>Ford Motor Co will start taking reservations for its electric sport utility vehicle, Mustang Mach-E, starting Nov. 17, when the U.S. automaker unveils the vehicle at an event in Los Angeles, the company said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Ford Motor Co will use the Mustang name, previously reserved for a muscle car, for an electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) that customers in the United States, Canada and Europe can start ordering on Nov. 17, the company said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ford confirmed its new electric SUV will be called the Mustang Mach-E ahead of a debut event scheduled for Los Angeles on Sunday. Until now, the Mustang name has been used only on a line of sporty coupes associated with Detroit's 1960s muscle car era.</p>

      <p>The SUV will be among a more than dozen all-electric automobiles the company plans to launch by 2022 with an investment of US$11.5 billion as it moves away from traditional gas-powered cars.</p>
      <p>In April, the No.2 U.S. carmaker invested US$500 million in electric automaker Rivian and said it planned to use the Michigan startup's platform to build a new Ford-branded electric vehicle.</p>
      <p>A reservation for the Mustang Mach-E can be made on Ford's website in the United States, Canada and Europe by paying a refundable deposit of US$500, the company said.</p>
      <p>Ford said it would announce reservation dates for China later.</p>
