      <h1>Bhadauria backs indigenisation, is first IAF chief to fly an HAL prototype</h1>
      <h2>For a prototype trainer aircraft, the "six-spin" test is considered the most conclusive landmark that signals the aircraft is ready to go into operational service</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:59:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author">Ajai Shukla</a></address>
      <p>Signalling a new, positive attitude in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-air-force">Indian Air Force </a>(IAF) towards indigenous aircraft, its recently appointed chief, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, test-flew the prototype Hindustan Turbo Trainer – 40 (HTT-40) at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hindustan-aeronautics-ltd">Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd </a>(HAL) in Bengaluru on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bhadauria became the first serving <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iaf">IAF </a>chief to fly an HAL-developed aircraft at the prototype stage. Bhadauria, himself an accomplished test pilot who has test-flown the Tejas fighter, was taken through the gruelling “six-spin routine” in which the HTT-40 prototype was allowed to spin six times before the pilot recovered it into level flight.</p>
      <p>For a prototype trainer aircraft, the “six-spin” test is considered the most conclusive landmark that signals the aircraft is ready to go into operational service.</p>
      <p>“The air chief expressed his satisfaction with the aircraft performance and appreciated the design, project and flight test teams for having achieved commendable progress”, stated HAL after the flight.</p>
      <p>The HTT-40, which will be used for training rookie pilots of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iaf">IAF </a>and navy, has now completed all major test points and met the performance parameters spelt out in the IAF’s Preliminary Staff Qualitative Requirements (PSQR). During testing the HTT-40 has completed stalls, engine re-lights, inverted flying, acrobatic flying and systems testing.</p>
      <p>“The project now needs to be speeded up for certification and HAL must target setting of modern manufacturing facilities with high production rate from the beginning,” stated Bhadauria.</p>
      <p>HAL is now looking forward to receiving a Request for Proposals (RFP) from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/iaf">IAF </a>for manufacturing the HTT-40. An estimated 106 basic trainers are needed to supplement the IAF’s fleet of 75 Pilatus PC-7 Mark II trainers that were imported from Switzerland.</p>
      <p>For years, the IAF has tried to shut down the HTT-40 programme, demanding the import of more Pilatus trainers instead. But through this period successive HAL chiefs have backed the HTT-40, committing Rs 350 crore of internal HAL funds to the project.</p>
      <p>Over the last five years, a team of young, talented HAL designers have worked without IAF assistance or funding, backed to the hilt by former defence ministers, AK Antony and Manohar Parrikar.</p>
      <p>For the Pilatus PC-7 Mark II trainer, the successful flight testing of the HTT-40 most likely spells the end of further imports. The HTT-40 falls under the category of “Indian designed, developed and manufactured” (IDDM) equipment, and the MoD cannot import more Pilatus without a detailed explanation of why the HTT-40 is being ignored.</p>
