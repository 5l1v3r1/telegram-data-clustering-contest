      <h1>Notts County loan star Kyle Wootton targets glorious promotion back to the Football League</h1>
      <h2>On-loan Scunthorpe forward has hit six goals so far this term</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Kyle Wootton feels he is yet to reach the peak of his powers at Notts County as he targeted a glorious return to the Football League this season.</p>
      <p>The striker took his goals tally to six for the season with a brace in the 3-2 FA Cup win at Ebbsfleet last weekend and is hoping to maintain that form when league duties resume against Barrow this weekend.</p>
      <p>Wootton has done exceptionally well since signing on a season-long loan from Scunthorpe earlier this season and has started nearly every game since his arrival.</p>
      <p>The young forward says he is relishing his time with the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a>, but feels there is still room for improvement despite his impressive return so far.</p>

      <p>But he is adamant that the ultimate aim for him and the rest of the squad is to be challenging for promotion back to the EFL.</p>
      <p>“You could say it’s one of my favourite loan spells,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got six goals, and I still feel I’ve got more to give and help the team out.</p>
      <p>“The main position for us is that we want to be up there getting promoted.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully that’s the outcome at the end of the season.”</p>
