        <b>Moazzem Hossain, a former chief of Sonagazi Police Station in Feni, was seen in tears while defending himself in court in a digital security case that stemmed from the death of madrasa student Nusrat Jahan Rafi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He says his family are ashamed of him being charged in the case.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter how severe the punishment will be because I’ve already received tougher punishment than that,” a crying Moazzem told Bangladesh Cyber Crime Tribunal in Dhaka on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I have been socially disgraced by the case. My 15-year-old son can’t go to school out of shame. I would not have received such punishment if I had carried out 10 killings.”</p>
      <p>“My mother in her 70s and my daughter are saddened by this.”</p>
      <p>Moazzem recorded Nusrat’s statement on his mobile phone when she pressed charges of sexual harassment against her madrasa principal Siraj-ud-Daula in March.</p>
      <p>The video was later released on social media amid widespread protest over a deadly arson attack on Nusrat by the followers of Siraj, who had already landed in jail on the sexual abuse charges, in April.</p>
      <p>A case was subsequently started against Moazzem in Dhaka under the Digital Security Act.</p>
      <p>A court in Feni sentenced Siraj and 15 others to death on Oct 24.</p>
