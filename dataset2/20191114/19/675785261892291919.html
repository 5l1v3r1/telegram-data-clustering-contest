      <h1>Roy Keane questions Gareth Southgate's handling of Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez bust-up</h1>
      <h2>The ITV pundit waded into the debate which has split the nation with Raheem Sterling sitting out of the game against Montenegro after being dropped by Gareth Southgate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:37:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>ITV pundit and former Republic of Ireland star Roy Keane believes the situation between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez has been made into a bigger deal than it needed to be.</p>
      <p>Sterling confronted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Joe Gomez on Tuesday, with emotions still clearly raw from the Reds' win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday, and the pair had a heated exchange before being separated.</p>
      <p>As a result of the scrap manager Gareth Southgate said Sterling would not be considered for the European Championship qualifier against Montenegro, although he may still return for Sunday's game against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Opinion has been split over whether Southgate made the right decision in dropping Sterling, and Keane thinks the fact the fight took place in the canteen has not helped matters.</p>

      <p>"It's not probably helped the situation (the fact it took place in the canteen)," Keane told ITV. "From my own experience, having been a manager, seeing players have fisticuffs- I think they've made a bigger deal than what it really is.</p>
      <p>"I think it's all part of the game. I suppose we're quite quick to criticise players for not caring.</p>
      <p>"Obviously Raheem is quite upset about the previous day - I’m not patting him on the back for going at one of his teammates, but I think Gareth [Southgate] could have played it down quite easily by saying ‘it’s no big deal, we move on’.</p>
      <p>“He’s had to speak about it for three days now. I’m not disagreeing with what Gareth’s done, again he probably knows more than us."</p>

      <p>Keane also revealed he had his own experience of coming to blows with a player, when he and former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> teammate Peter Schmeichel had a brief falling out.</p>
      <p>“But from my own experience, I’ve previously had a fight with a player - Peter Schmeichel - in a hotel. Obviously it was in the lobby, it was about four o’clock in the morning, there wasn’t many people around.</p>
      <p>“We got pulled by the manager, he said we were both a disgrace. To be fair to Peter, he apologised. But we moved on, it never affected us as teammates.</p>
      <p>“When I hear about the PR side of it, where players who have to apologise to the group, I kind of don’t get all that side of it.</p>
      <p>“Because if you have a bust-up with somebody, why are you apologising to your teammates? It’s all part of the game, and generally speaking, when you do have a bit of a bust-up, you end up being pretty fine afterwards, because sometimes you almost clear the air. There’s tension involved, and players care."</p>
