      <p>Chippa United defender’s recovery from the horrific injury he suffered against Kaizer Chiefs has been lauded. </p>
      <p>In May last year, as Chippa managed to succesfully escape relegation with their 1-0 win against Chiefs on the last day of their Absa Premiership campaign, Tebogo Makobela suffered a career-threatening injury that forced him to be substituted. </p>

      <p>At the time, the Chilli Boys confirmed that Makobela suffered a leg break from a tackle by Teenage Hadebe.</p>
      <p>With the Port Elizabeth outfit oozing with confidence at the moment, following their first win of the season against AmaZulu before the FIFA international break, the club has confirmed that Makobela has 'miraculously' returned to the field for training.   </p>
