      <h2>The English media outlet claim regardless of UEFA's findings from the FFP investigations, Guardiola's side won't be thrown out of the competition</h2>

      <p>Manchester City won't be banned from competing in the Champions League according to English media outlet The Athletic. Instead of being thrown out of Europe's elite competition, the most City can expect is to be hit with a fine.</p>
      <p>The official verdict of the investigation will be revealed within the next month or two. UEFA created the Financial Fair Play regulations in 2009 in order to control and protect clubs from only being able to spend what they earned and could afford to.</p>
      <p>LaLiga chief Javier Tebas has made his thoughts clear on the likes of City and PSG bypassing the rules in order to have an unfair advantage. Both of those mentioned teams have been fined in the past for previous infractions.</p>
      <p>The current investigation is related to sponsorship money brought in by companies which have links to the City owner. Rivals have accused the club of receiving above market value deals to offset excessive spending.</p>
      <p>This information came to light after City's email accounts were hacked.</p>
