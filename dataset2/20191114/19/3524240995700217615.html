        <b>Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Nigeria Police Force says investigation into the allegation of rape leveled against the Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, is still on.</p>
      <p>The Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, said this during an interview with <i>The PUNCH</i> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mba was reacting to the judge’s dismissal of a suit instituted against Fatoyinbo by his accuser, Mrs. Busola Dakolo.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Dakolo, who is the wife of popular musician, Timi Dakolo, had filed a civil suit before an FCT High Court in Bwari, insisting that the alleged action of the pastor as well as his denial in a statement adversely affected her marital sex life.</p>
      <p>She, therefore, demanded “a personal letter of apology” from the cleric to show honest remorse for his misdeeds.</p>

      <p>In his ruling, Justice Oathman Musa held that the matter amounted to injustice and an abuse of judicial process; adding that the case was empty and purely sentimental.</p>
      <p>Justice Musa said the case was aimed more at cruelty than at obtaining justice.</p>
      <p>The court also awarded costs of N1m against Busola Dakolo and held that the fine should have been 10 times more because the court’s time was wasted.</p>
      <p>But the Police spokesman told <i>The PUNCH</i> that the court case was a civil one and therefore had no bearing on the Police probe.</p>
      <p>Mba said the investigation would continue and the Police would charge Fatoyinbo if he is found culpable.</p>
      <p>He said, “The position of the law in Nigeria, which is very clear, is that a criminal investigation and prosecution can run concurrently with a civil litigation.</p>
      <p>“Failure in one does not foreclose the other. And so, we are going on with our own case and when we are done, we will keep Nigerians posted.”</p>
