      <p>Members of the Durban serious corruption investigation unit of the Hawks have raided the Department of Social Development in Pietermaritzburg.</p>
      <p>Amid an investigation into corrupt activities, a search and seizure operation was conducted, KwaZulu-Natal Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo confirmed to News24 on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We can confirm that Hawks members from the Durban serious corruption investigation unit conducted a search and seizure operation at social development offices in Pietermaritzburg.</p>
      <p>"The search emanates from the ongoing investigation of fraud, corruption, money laundering and contravention of the PFMA [Public Finance Management Act]," Mhlongo said.</p>
      <p>According to theÂ <a href="https://maritzburgsun.co.za/61626/breaking-news-hawks-raid-dept-headquarters/?fbclid=IwAR0AnYWJoOQySnnj1Ae2EtLKo0yGKCmDzq4ew3OCtvDma2t-CU8PUwkoIkI#.Xc13QKlGBwo.facebook">Maritzburg Sun</a>, the Hawks were seen leaving the building with bags and documents.</p>
      <p>The publication reported that allegations of corruption surfaced against the department's senior officials, alleging that millions of rand were siphoned through bogus organisations.</p>
      <p>The raid follows a week-long protest by NPOs against the department.</p>
