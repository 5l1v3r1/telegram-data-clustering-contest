      <p>In his upcoming adaptation of the 2014 documentary <i>Next Goal Wins</i>, <b>Taika Waititi</b> tells the story of the American Samoa soccer team and their fight to end the longest losing streak in FIFA history. Joining the cast, which already includes <b>Michael Fassbender</b> and <b>Elisabeth Moss</b>, is <b>Kaimana </b>in the role of <b>Jaiyah Saelua</b>, the first non-binary player to play in a FIFA World Cup qualifying game.</p>
      <p>Kaimana, who like the inspiration for their role is a non-binary Samoan (or fa’afafine in Samoan), will be making their acting debut in the film. Speaking of the thought process in casting Kaimana to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/taika-waititi-kaimana-next-goal-wins-1203371720/">Variety</a>, Waititi said that they’d considered casting Saelua, the original soccer player from the documentary, but ran across a “beautiful” person in Hawaii, where the film is being shot, who is a “good actor…and plays sport as well, which is great.” There was never a consideration to casting a cisgender actor in the part, Waititi continued. “It was vital. There was no way we would have approached it in any other way.”</p>

      <p>The script is written by Waititi and <b>Iain Morris</b>. The pair last worked together on an episode of the television adaptation of <i>What We Do in the Shadows. </i>While Moss’ character is currently unknown, Fassbender will be playing Dutch soccer coach Thomas Rongen who helps guide the hapless Samoan team in their bid to turn their fortunes around.</p>
      <p>After production ends on <i>Next Goal Wins</i>, it’s expected that Waititi will move on directly to shoot the highly anticipated follow-up to <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> titled <i>Thor:Love and Thunder. </i>Slated to begin shooting in March of 2020, Waititi has <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/08/taika-waititis-fox-searchlight-project-next-goal-wins-details-revealed-1202664185/">completed the script</a> for his latest entry in the MCU that will feature the return of both <b>Tessa Thompson</b> as Valkyrie and <b>Natalie Portman</b>, who previously parted ways with Marvel and her character Jane Foster. In the upcoming film, Foster will follow a popular arc in the comics and become The Mighty Thor.</p>
