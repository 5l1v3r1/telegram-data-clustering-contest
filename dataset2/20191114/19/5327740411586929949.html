      <h1>Bus drivers to refuse overtime as talks break down between Unifor, Coast Mountain</h1>
      <h2>Overtime ban could disrupt 10-15 per cent of bus service in Metro Vancouver</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:55:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/katya-slepian/" target="_blank">Katya Slepian</a></address>
      <p>Bus riders in Metro Vancouver could see delays on Friday, following an announcement from Unifor that bargaining with the Coast Mountain Bus Company has broken down.</p>
      <p>Unifor, which represents 5,000 bus and SeaBus drivers, said talks “have failed to reach a fair resolution for transit workers.”</p>
      <p>The breakdown follows one-and-a-half days of bargaining that started Wednesday, after talks broke down on Oct. 31. This is the fourteenth day of job action for transit workers, which has seen a uniform ban for bus drivers and an overtime ban for maintenance workers.</p>
      <p>Unifor has warned a overtime ban for bus drivers could see 10-15 per cent of the region’s bus routes disrupted.</p>
