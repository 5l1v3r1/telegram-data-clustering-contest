      <h2>Keanu Bedward gunned down Remal Hunt in broad daylight before escaping to Dubai - and it was all caught on camera.</h2>

      <p>This is the harrowing moment a thug opened fire on a Birmingham street - killing a dad in broad daylight before fleeing to Dubai.</p>
      <p>Remal Hunt, a 'much-loved son, brother and father' was gunned down on Church Road, Erdington, at midday on April 28.</p>
      <p>His killer - Keanu Bedward - was today jailed for life for the sickening murder on the usually quiet, residential street earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The horrific shooting, in the middle of the day, 'put innocent people at risk' and devastated the victim's family, police say.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage released today by West Midlands Police and shown above, captured a 'chance' meeting between the feuding street gang factions.</p>
      <p>Minutes later, it would end in murder.</p>

      <p>A row can be seen breaking out between the pair on Erdington High Street, and they are caught on camera giving chase in their cars through busy shopping areas and onto residential streets.</p>
      <p>The pursuit continues until a loud, single gunshot can be heard ringing out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Bedward, 25, can be seen speeding from the scene after shooting Remal Hunt dead.</p>
      <p>He was aged just 28.</p>
      <p>Bedward is again captured on camera after ditching the car on Stonechat Drive and then hours later when he arrives at Manchester Airport in a taxi.</p>

      <p>From here, in a bid to escape justice, he flew to Dubai on an evening flight.</p>
      <p>But he was caught by West Midlands Police trying to sneak back into the UK through Manchester Airport 11 days later - as officers lay in wait in arrivals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>An extensive CCTV trawl carried out by detectives showed Bedward behind the wheel of his black VW Golf in Erdington High Street when another black Golf containing Remal Hunt pulled up alongside.</p>
      <p>On 26 April a handgun weighted down inside a black ‘man-bag’ was recovered beside Bartley Green reservoir by fire service crew on a training exercise. <br/><br/>It was forensically examined and returned a DNA hit to Bedward and detectives suspect it’s the weapon he used to kill Mr Hunt.</p>

      <p>On his arrest, Bedward denied involvement in the murder but a jury at Birmingham Crown Court today (14 November) found him guilty and he was jailed for life with a minimum of 30 years behind bars. <br/><br/>Remal’s family paid tribute to him in a statement that read: “Remal was a very much-loved son, brother and father who was kind-hearted and will be sadly missed."</p>
      <p>Det Insp Caroline Corfield, who led the investigation, added: “Bedward was identified as a suspect at an early stage in the investigation and, knowing he’d fled the country, we were ready for his return and our officers were waiting for him at the airport. <br/><br/>“This was a shocking murder in which a firearm was discharged in the middle of the day in a residential street; a sickening act which killed a young man and put innocent people at risk. <br/><br/>“Anyone linked to illegal firearms should expect to receive a significant custodial sentence. Remal’s family are devastated and no sentence can ever compensate their loss; my thoughts are with them."</p>
