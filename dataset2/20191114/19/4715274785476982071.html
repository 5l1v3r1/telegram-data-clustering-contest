      <h1>How traffic causes engine damage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T19:40:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author">Manila Standard</a></address>
      <p>Traffic is a harsh reality of city driving. During these extended durations, your car is at its most vulnerable state, as frequent idling and stop-start driving stresses the engine, eventually leading to long-term damage.</p>
      <p>The traffic situation is not expected to ease anytime soon, with the Land Transportation Office revealing that 11.6 million motor vehicles were registered in 2018, 11.4 percent more than the 10.5 million registered the previous year. As early as 2015, the Philippines has been ranked by Waze’s Global Satisfaction Survey among the top 5 countries with the worst traffic in the world.</p>
      <p>Worsening traffic conditions not only make for a more challenging drive; it also creates a difficult environment for the engine, raising the risk of microscopic wear. According to a global average which examined traffic in 50 cities, the average driver these days can stop and start as many as 18,000* times in a year, while spending up to 33%* of urban driving time idling. Combine this with intervals of constant acceleration and deceleration, the engine will at some point suffer from irreversible engine damage. </p>
      <p>To help motorists combat such extreme engine wear and tear, Castrol has launched the latest generation Castrol MAGNATEC with breakthrough DUALOCK Technology that provides non-stop engine protection for a variety of car engines such as 10W-40 grade for gasoline engines; 10W-50 for diesel engines; and fully synthetic oil 5W-30, for both gasoline and diesel engines.  </p>
      <p>This pioneering formulation is the result of ten years of research and development to create a lubricant specifically engineered for today’s urban driving environment and designed to protect engines against the wear caused by stop-and-start driving. </p>
      <p>Castrol MAGNATEC’s new DUALOCK molecules lock together to form a powerful force-field of protection on vital engine components, resulting in a 50%* reduction in wear and tear from engine warm-up and stop-start driving, even for vehicles running on the latest stop-start technology. </p>
      <p>“We formulated Castrol MAGNATEC with the everyday driver in mind. We’ve devoted ourselves at Castrol to help address the detrimental effects traffic congestion has on vehicles,” said Maria Tañada, Castrol Philippines Country Manager.</p>
      <p>“Through Castrol MAGNATEC’s breakthrough DUALOCK Technology, we are fulfilling our consumer’s need for non-stop protection that goes over and beyond regular car oils.”</p>
