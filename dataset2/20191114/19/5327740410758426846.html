      <p>RCMP are on the scene at Elgin Park Secondary in South Surrey investigating an unspecified threat.</p>
      <p>Police responded just before 11 a.m., and have traffic blocked in both directions in the 13400-block of 24 Avenue while the investigation continues. About a dozen police cars are on scene, along with a number of police dog teams. An RCMP helicopter was also seen in the air.</p>
      <p>“The school received a threat… and when it comes to the safety of our schools, we can’t and won’t take any chances. We treat all threats to schools and other areas as real until we can confirm that they are not,” Cpl. Elenore Sturko told <i>Peace Arch News</i>.</p>
      <p>The school is currently in ‘hold and secure’ protocol, Sturko added.</p>

      <p>RCMP school resource officers have also been sent to two nearby elementary schools as a precautionary measure, said Const. Richard Wright.</p>
      <p>During a hold-and-secure, students and staff are kept inside, but continue on with normal operations.</p>
      <p>While the investigation continues, parents and others are asked not to attend the school, Surrey RCMP tweeted shortly before noon.</p>
      <p>“We’re working to determine if the threat is real,” Sturko said.</p>
