      <p>Chrissy Teigen has jokingly apologised to husband John Legend after Idris Elba replied to her throwback challenge.</p>
      <p>Legend was named sexiest man alive by People magazine, succeeding Elba, who won the crown last year.</p>
      <p>Grammy-winning singer Legend admitted to being “perplexed” at being named the winner, and shared a picture of himself from 1995 in which he is wearing oversized glasses.</p>

      <p>He compared it to a smouldering picture of the modern-day Elba.</p>
      <p>Teigen – who has changed her Twitter bio to “currently sleeping with people’s sexiest man alive” – replied by tweeting: “Yeah but let’s see an @IdrisElba pic from 1995 (prob still very hot).”</p>
      <p>Luther star Elba, picked by many to be the next James Bond, has now responded with a picture of himself from “1995-ish”.</p>
      <p>After seeing the snap, Teigen responded by apologising to Legend.</p>
      <p>“Sorry @JohnLegend, I tried!!!,” she said.</p>

      <p>Legend and Teigen are one of Hollywood’s most high-profile couples. They met in 2006 while filming the music video for his song Stereo and tied the knot at a ceremony in Lake Como in 2013.</p>
      <p>They have two children together – daughter Luna, three, and one-year-old son Miles.</p>
      <p>Legend, who wrote the hit song All Of Me about Teigen, told People she is the love of his life.</p>
      <p>He said: “She’s the one. It’s clear! We have great chemistry. She makes me laugh all the time. She’s a wonderful mother. She’s my best friend.”</p>
      <p>He added: “She inspires some good love songs.”</p>
