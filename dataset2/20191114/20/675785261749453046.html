      <h2>The Prince of Wales says he has spent decades trying to convince major businesses and governments to invest in sustainability</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:27:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-charles-prince-of-wales">Prince Charles</a> has spoken of his struggle to bring together major organisations to help fight climate change.</p>
      <p>As the Mirror launched our <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/daily-mirrors-climate-crisis-issue-20861834">climate crisis edition</a> today, the Prince of Wales told how “for the last 35 to 40 years” he had campaigned for “major financial institutions, businesses and governments to make market mechanisms to work for not against sustainability”.</p>
      <p>Celebrating his 71st birthday in India at the end of a two day whistle-stop tour, Charles joined a group of prominent Indian business leaders in a nearby room for a roundtable discussion on sustainable markets.</p>
      <p>In September he set up the Sustainable Markets Council - with support from the World Economic Forum - to bring together major financial institutions, businesses and governments to make market mechanisms “work for not against sustainability”.</p>
      <p>Before the private meeting began Charles told the group: “If I may say, you might not know but I’ve been trying - I don’t know, for the last 35 to 40 years - to encourage corporate, social and environmental responsibility and it’s been a bit of an uphill struggle.</p>

      <p>“Particular in terms of trying to raise awareness amongst the financial services and capital markets sector about the importance of tackling these huge challenges around climate change, global warming, resource depletion, deforestation - all these issues.”</p>
      <p>When in Tokyo for the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito last month, Charles earned that the fight was now “more critical than ever” and said global capital markets must play a vital role in reversing the damage to the planet’s oceans, atmosphere and soil.</p>
      <p>He said: “We could never actually crack the real problem, which was the lack of the real understanding on the part of the financial services and capital markets sector to understand why there was such a need to invest.”</p>
      <p>But the Prince said interest had “suddenly taken off” as investors have come to realise that “to be frank the returns on investment on sustainable investing are greater now [than many of ] the conventional ones, such as stranded assets like fossil fuels”.</p>

      <p>He added: “There are many more people wanting to look for sustainable investment opportunities which would actually direct the money to the most effective things — whether it is regeneration, reforestation, sorting out fisheries and ocean issues to make them more sustainable.</p>
      <p>“Or agriculture and how to rebuild soil fertility, which is completely degraded around most of the world. Because if you can get the soil fertility back again, you can capture carbon much more quickly.”</p>
      <p>The Prince received a birthday present in miniature from a group of Indian schoolchildren - bonsai fairy gardens.</p>
      <p>Back in the UK the prince’s sons and daughters-in-law paid tribute by releasing touching pictures of the heir to the throne on social media with goodwill messages.</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex posted a new photograph showing their son Archie with Harry and Charles, while an image from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge featured the prince holding grandson Prince Louis’s hands as he is cradled by Kate.</p>
      <p>The children had been stumped over what to give the future king but came up with the idea of a present featuring the stories of Hindu deity Krishna, told with tiny figures in three bonsai gardens.</p>

      <p>Their school has been supported by the Piramal Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Piramal Group led by Indian billionaire industrialist Ajay Piramal.</p>
      <p>His wife, Dr Swati Piramal, said: “What can you give a prince? What can the kids give him? So they thought of the bonsai gardens.”</p>
      <p>She said one tiny garden tells the story of Krishna stealing butter, the second depicts the deity being born in a jail and his father escaping with him as a baby, and the last describes his time as a cow herder.</p>
      <p>Dr Piramal said: “He really loved it when I showed it to him, because of course in England there’s a culture of fairy gardens, there are gnomes, but this is unique because this is Krishna’s fairy garden.”</p>

      <p>Charles’s two-day trip to India ended with a garland of flowers being placed around his neck and he clasped his hands in the traditional Hindu Namaste greeting when a boy gave him a flower.</p>
      <p>The children sang Happy Birthday to the prince as he cut a large chocolate cake.</p>
      <p>He offered one young girl a piece of chocolate sponge from the end of the knife, and could not resist licking his fingers afterwards.</p>
      <p>Charles is spending an undisclosed period privately in India before he starts a tour of the South Pacific, lasting more than a week, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He will spend the majority of his time in New Zealand with wife Camilla before making solo trips to the Solomon Islands.</p>
