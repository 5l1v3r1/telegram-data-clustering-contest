      <p>Raw Fury revealed a new game during today's X019 livestream today called West of Dead, a twin-stick voice set in a supernatural Wild West that looks like a between Diablo and Jonah Hex, starring Ghost Rider.</p>
      <p>The western setting is actually Purgatory, an ever-changing world where dead man William Mason has, for reasons unknown, been brought back to fiery-headed life to do what he does—which is, as far as I can tell, kill everything that moves.</p>
      <p>But is there more to this story than meets the eye? The <a href="https://westofdead.com/">West of Dead website</a> suggests that there might be: "When a dead man awakens with only the memory of a figure in black, he sets into motion a chain of events that have truly mythic consequences."</p>
      <p>West of Dead is currently available in open beta until November 25—but only on the Xbox One—and is expected to be out sometime in 2020</p>
