      <p>Speaking about the upcoming event, Project Lead and Head of Media, AFRIMA, Sola Dada, said, “It is no doubt this year’s AFRIMA Music Village attendees will leave with utmost fulfilment. The decision by the International Committee of AFRIMA to change the venue and take the concert closer to the grassroots in Agege Stadium, Agege Lagos where die-hard and loyal music lovers are, is to avail them the opportunity to experience their favorite African stars perform live on stage.</p>
      <p>“From its inception, the concert has catered to its audience creating an experience that stays with them for a long time.The previous edition in Ghana at the 100,000-capacity Independence Square in Accra left the crowd yearning for more and the sixth edition will surely surpass previous ones,” he added.</p>
