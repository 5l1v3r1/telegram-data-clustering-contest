      <p>The developer of <i>Sea of Thieves</i>, <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>, and <i>Battletoads</i> revealed its next project, an open-world adventure titled <i>Everwild</i>, during Microsoft’s X019 Inside Xbox presentation on Thursday.</p>
      <p><i>Everwild</i> is an all-new property for Rare, but the developer didn’t reveal much in the way of details about its next project. A debut trailer for the game, which you can watch above, showed a colorful and magical world inhabited by fantastical creatures — sadly none of them made of piñata materials. Humans in this world (or what look like humans) appear to cautiously interact with the game’s fantasy animals, which appear both timid and wild. <i>Everwild</i> is apparently early in development.</p>
      <p>Rare said it will continue to work on its other game, <i>Sea of Thieves</i>, while developing <i>Everwild</i>.</p>
