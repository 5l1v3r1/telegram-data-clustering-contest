      <h1>Mo’Nique Sues Netflix for Racial and Gender Discrimination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:45:55+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Megh Wright</a></address>
      <p>Nearly two years after <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/monique-netflix-amy-schumer-chris-rock-dave-chappelle.html">calling on her fans to boycott Netflix</a> for what she alleged was racial and gender bias, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/monique-netflix-boycott-tyler-perry-lee-daniels-oprah-whoopi-goldberg-interview.html">Mo’Nique</a> is taking her case against the streaming network to court. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/actress-mo-nique-suing-netflix-race-gender-discrimination-n1081436">According to NBC News</a>, the comedian and actor filed a lawsuit against Netflix today, in which she accuses the company of giving her a “biased, discriminatory” offer for a one-hour comedy special back in 2017. Mo’Nique was vocal about the low offer at the time and even <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/wanda-sykes-thanks-monique-for-speaking-against-netflix.html">earned the support of fellow comic Wanda Sykes</a>, who <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/wanda-sykes-not-normal-netflix-comedy-special-review.html">later had a Netflix comedy special of her own</a> after, as she put it, Netflix <a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/wanda-sykes-netflix-special-comedy-silicon-valleywood-1203195861/">“moved that comma.”</a></p>
      <p>Mo’Nique confirmed the news of the lawsuit in an Instagram post today. “I had a choice to make: I could accept what I felt was pay discrimination or I could stand up for those who came before me and those who will come after me,” she wrote. “I chose to stand up.” </p>

      <p>Mo’Nique’s lawsuit against Netflix cites the offers it reportedly gave to other high-profile comedians for specials, including Jerry Seinfeld ($100 million), Dave Chappelle ($60 million), Chris Rock ($40 million), and Amy Schumer, who <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/schumer-asked-netflix-to-match-offers-to-chappelle-and-rock.html">retroactively negotiated her $11 million offer</a> to, reportedly, $13 million. Mo’Nique, on the other hand, was offered a $500,000 “talent fee.” “Netflix reportedly offered or paid Rock, Chappelle, DeGeneres, and Gervais forty (40) times more per show than it offered Mo’Nique, and it offered Schumer twenty-six (26) times more per show than Mo’Nique,” the lawsuit notes. “In short, Netflix’s offer to Mo’Nique perpetuates the drastic wage gap forced upon Black women in America’s workforce.”</p>
      <p>The lawsuit also says that Netflix has “historically lacked racial diversity,” noting that in 2018 and 2019 the streaming network reported only 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of its employees were black. Several examples of racial discrimination at the company are highlighted, including allegations of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kevin-spacey-n-word-house-cards-security-guard-racism-783764">Kevin Spacey saying the N-word on the set of <i>House of Cards</i></a><i> </i>and chief communications officer Jonathan Friedland also using the N-word in a meeting and later during an HR meeting about the incident, after which <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/netflix-fires-pr-chief-n-word-jonathan-friedland.html">he was fired from his position</a>. The suit also notes past instances of pay discrimination, including the news that <i>The Crown </i>star <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/the-crown-a-guide-to-the-gender-pay-gap-controversy.html">Claire Foy was paid significantly less than Matt Smith</a><i> </i>last year.</p>
      <p><b>Update, 5:54 p.m.: </b>A spokesperson for Netflix has responded to the lawsuit with a statement. “We care deeply about inclusion, equity, and diversity and take any accusations of discrimination very seriously,” the statement says. “We believe our opening offer to Mo’Nique was fair — which is why we will be fighting this lawsuit.”</p>
