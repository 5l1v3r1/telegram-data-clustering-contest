      <p>The company expects to have on boarded all of the trucking companies it works with by February, 2020. Those working at various points of the supply chain can then use a web portal and streamline mobile application to interact with the blockchain system.</p>
      <p>Senior vice-president of logistics and supply chain at Walmart <a href="http://www.newsbtc.com/tags/canada">Canada</a>, John Bayliss, commented on the new system:</p>
      <blockquote>“This new dynamic and interactive blockchain technology platform is creating complete transparency between Walmart Canada and all of our carrier partners… Blockchain is enabling a material advance in our smart transportation network.”</blockquote>
      <p>Bayliss added that the platform would drastically improve efficiency in logistics and would allow for not only financial savings but would reduce the firm’s environmental footprint too.</p>
      <p>The new system is a collaboration between Walmart Canada and DLT Labs. The Toronto-based blockchain startup’s CEO, Loudon Owen also provided comment on the newly-launched system:</p>
      <blockquote>“DLT Labs is delighted to partner with such an extraordinary organization to bring the world’s first and largest blockchain solution for industry into production… Just as the Roman’s concept, ‘dictum meum pactum’ (meaning ‘my word is my bond’) was fundamental to building trade, this product creates a secure digital handshake using blockchain to renew trust and efficiency in global trade.”</blockquote>
      <p>Although <i>NewsBTC</i> has reported on similar systems by other<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/10/26/food-shipment-successfully-moved-on-bitcoin-blockchain-with-smart-contracts/"> large companies</a> in the past, the new blockchain network from Walmart does appear to much grander in scale. The company says its 8.75 million square feet of distribution centres are routinely visited by over 4,500 associates and drivers. The system will eventually connect them all. Given the expanse of the new network, the company is expecting the automated of data collecting and management will result in massive financial savings.</p>
