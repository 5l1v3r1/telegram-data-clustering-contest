      <p>He particularly urgeg members of the Peoples Democratic Party to use the power of their overwhelming strength in those two states in ensuring that its flag remains standing in the Bayelsa State Government House and that the people of Kogi State can begin to have a feel of better life under a PDP administration.</p>
      <p>He also said the senatorial election in Kogi West was crucial and that party members need to turn out in their numbers to defend the seat.</p>
      <p>According to him, the leadership of the PDP has abiding confidence in the voters in that senatorial election.</p>
      <p>He stated that the choice before the electorate is between a continuation of quality representation at the Senate and a promise of meaningless change.</p>
      <p>He said it was pertinent for all political actors to exhibit necessary decorum and sportsmanship.</p>
      <p>The former presidential candidate urged all security agencies on election duty to do their job with utmost professionalism.</p>
      <p>He advised all parties in the election to bear in mind that democracy can flourish only when everyone plays according to rule.</p>
