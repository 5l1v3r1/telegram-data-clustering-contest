      <h1>Nomos Glashütte's watches take cues from Bauhaus style</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:00:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/dezeen-staff/" target="_blank">Dezeen staff</a></address>
      <p><b>Dezeen promotion:</b> <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/nomos-glashutte/">Nomos Glashütte</a> has introduced two <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/bauhaus/">Bauhaus</a>-influenced watches, the Tangente midnight blue and the Tangente 38 midnight blue.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nomos-glashuette.com/en/?utm_source=%20dezeen&amp;utm_medium=advertising&amp;utm_campaign=Christmas2019&amp;utm_content=Textlink">Nomos Glashütte</a> first launched the Tangente range 25 years ago, with the addition of the two midnight blue watches bringing the total number of models in the collection to 20.</p>

      <p>The mechanical timepieces are available in two sizes, one with a face that is 35 millimetres in diameter and a larger model that is 38 millimetres in diameter.</p>
      <p>The watches are hand-wound and are the first timepieces in the Tangente range to have a midnight blue dial. Nomos Glashütte created the watch with a "form follows function" philosophy to have an aesthetic that takes design cues from the Bauhaus – a highly influential German design school that was established in 1919.</p>

      <p>The pair of watches have matching midnight blue dials, but each one has subtle differences that make it unique. The deep blue dials are designed to frame and coordinate with gold and silver accents.</p>

      <p>"Gold accents provided by hands and typography give the smaller version of Tangente midnight blue an appealing warmth [while] Tangente 38 midnight blue features exclusively silver hands and typography," explained the German watchmaking company.</p>

      <p>The Tangente watches are powered by Nomos Glashütte's Alpha collection's calibre, which is highly precise and hand wound. The watches' mechanics – including ribbing on the three-quarter plate, perlage on the base and polished ratchet wheel – are visible through a sapphire crystal back plate.</p>
      <p>The watches are available with a velour leather strap and are splash proof making it appropriate for everyday use.</p>

      <p>"These traditional features draw on a rich heritage: the watchmaking town of Glashütte, tucked away in the rural hills of Saxony, is the ticking heart of German watch making," Nomos Glashütte explained.</p>
      <p>"[Glashütte has been] famous around the world for its high-quality timepieces [and] has flourished since German reunification in 1990."</p>
