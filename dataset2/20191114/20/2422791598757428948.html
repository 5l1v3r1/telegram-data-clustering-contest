      <h1>Electric cars, building retrofits in Yukon plan to fight climate change</h1>

      <p>WHITEHORSE -- Yukon says it could turn to electric vehicles and building retrofits to help fight climate change.</p>
      <p>The northern territory says in a draft document that it needs to cut 264,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to reach its target of a 30 per cent reduction by 2030.</p>
      <p>Transportation and heating account for three-quarters of the territory's emissions and that's where Yukon's biggest initiatives are aimed.</p>
      <p>They include a plan to have one in six vehicles powered by electricity by the end of the decade.</p>
      <p>The territory also plans to encourage the use of clean diesel and biodiesel for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.</p>
      <p>Other proposals include spending $30 million a year on retrofits to make buildings more energy efficient and having 40 per cent of its heating powered by renewable resources by 2030.</p>
      <p>The government says its plans will take the territory about three-quarters of the way to its target. It hopes the rest can be achieved through innovation and new technology.</p>
      <p>The mining sector is to have separate targets based on emissions intensity, or how much carbon dioxide is released for every tonne of ore.</p>
      <p>About 90 per cent of Yukon's electricity is already produced by hydro development.</p>
