      <p>If Rudy Giuliani, a central figure in the impeachment probe into President Trump, is going to keep talking to the media, at least he’s now letting his lawyer chaperone him.</p>
      <p>The lawyer, Robert Costello, who Giuliani only hired last week, felt the need to interject when Giuliani was asked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-insurance-loyal?CMP=share_btn_tw">by the Guardian</a> about speculation that he may be sacrificed in order to protect Trump.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was worried that Trump might “throw” him “under the bus, Giuliani said, “I’m not.”</p>
      <p>“But I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid,” he said with a laugh, according to the Guardian. This prompted his lawyer to interject.</p>
      <p>“He’s joking,” said Costello, who, according to the Guardian, was dialed in on the call.</p>
      <p>As several witnesses have identified Giuliani as the leader of the Ukraine pressure campaign that the House is investigating, some Republicans have sought to <a href="https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-impeachment-republicans-rudy-giuliani-f192d64d-2bee-4597-8de8-3e0477b988de.html">distance</a> Trump from the effort and blame Giuliani — Trump’s personal lawyer — for going rogue.</p>
      <p>Giuliani has described his Ukraine endeavors as being part of the defense of his client.</p>
      <p>He has also pushed back on past attempts to paint him as a solo actor. Back in September, he <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/giuliani-texts-state-department-ukraine-protect">bragged</a> that he had a “nice little trail” of texts with a U.S. diplomat that he said showed that the State Department approved of his Ukraine efforts.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to use them to protect myself if and when I need them,” he said then.</p>
