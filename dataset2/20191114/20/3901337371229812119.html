      <p>Reigning Copa America champions Brazil take on arch-rivals Argentina in the Clasico del Atlantico on Friday, in what promises to be a mouthwatering affair. Here is how the Brazilians could line up without star man Neymar as they go head to head with Lionel Messi and company.</p>
      <p>

          <u>Click through the gallery above to see how Brazil could line up against Argentina without Neymar, in an attacking 4-4-2 formation.</u>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>The Selecao will be without the services of talismanic forward Neymar, who was ruled out of action as he continues to recover from an injury sustained during the previous international break.</p>
      <p>While Brazil will be without their star attacker, they will head into the match with the 2018/19 UEFA Champions League Goalkeeper of the Year between the sticks. Liverpool star Alisson Becker missed the last international break through an injury of his own, but returns to take his place in goal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In defence, the Paris Saint-Germain duo of Thiago Silva and Marquinhos are likely to start at centre-back, and could be flanked by the Juventus pairing of Danilo and Alex Sandro at right-back and left-back, respectively.</p>
      <p>LaLiga-based midfielders Casemiro, of Real Madrid, and Arthur, of FC Barcelona, are favourites to be chosen to marshal the centre of the park for the record five-time FIFA World Cup winners, while Bayern Munich's Philippe Coutinho will take up a position on the left.</p>
      <p>Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus, who favours a more central role, could once again be used on the right-wing ahead of Willian after impressing in that role during his previous call-up.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Merseyside rivals Roberto Firmino and Richarlison, who play for Liverpool and Everton, respectively, are the most likely pair to lead the line for the Selecao, while Real Madrid wonderkid Rodrygo could make his senior debut off the bench.</p>
