      <p>"The OAWP failed to fully protect whistleblowers from retaliation," Inspector General for the VA, Michael Missal, said during testimony to a House committee Thursday. "VA employees who identify serious misconduct must feel protected when coming forward with complaints."</p>
      <p>"There was a culture of fear that was created by the processes," Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D-FL 23rd District) said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Tamara Bonzanto, Assistant Secretary of the OAWP said she flagged major problems created under the previous leadership which she has since changed.</p>
      <p>Bonzanto pointed to investigative reports without witness interviews, a backlog of 572 cases dating back to 2017 and a list kept on the whistleblowers.</p>
      <p>"This list contained detailed information about allegations raised by individuals and OAWP staff opinion about the individuals and their allegations," Bonzanto said.</p>
      <p>Bonzanto said the OAWP has created smaller investigative teams to improve oversight and started a quality control team to independently review whistleblower complaints.</p>
      <p>Bonzanto said the goal is to reduce the backlog of 572 cases to 120 by the end of next year.</p>
