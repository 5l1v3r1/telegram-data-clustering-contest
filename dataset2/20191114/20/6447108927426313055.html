      <p>Taking a step away from their first party games, Microsoft featured an upcoming ID@Xbox title. West of Dead is coming from publisher Raw Fury, developer Upstream Arcade, and with the gravelly voice of Ron Perlman. The game is now in Open Beta on Xbox One, but not for long, as the beta ends on 25th November.</p>
      <p>The full game will arrive on PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Windows Store, GOG and Steam in 2020.</p>

      <p>Set in Wyoming, 1888, your flaming skull-headed cowboy descends into Purgatory to battle the souls and mythological beast within. It’s a roguelite twin-stick shooter with procedural generation.</p>
      <p>We went hands on with the game at XO19 today, and if that mish-mash of genre and setting sounds like your jam, it’s definitely worth checking out while it’s in beta.</p>
