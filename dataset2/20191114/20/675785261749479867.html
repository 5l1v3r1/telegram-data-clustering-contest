      <h1>Joe Root hoping for fresh start after suffering his worst summer of batting ever</h1>
      <h2>Root failed to hit the standards expected of him over the summer period but believes the appointment of Chris Silverwood as head coach could galvanise him</h2>

      <p>Joe Root reckons he has put in the hard graft that will see his batting soar to new levels of Test run scoring.</p>
      <p>The England captain and scorer of 16 Test centuries endured his worst summer yet in 2019 as he failed to register a single three-figure score against Australia or Ireland.</p>
      <p>There were three ducks at Lord’s, Headingley and Old Trafford while his average sat under 30 for the first time.</p>
      <p>Of course these were exceptional circumstances with the Ashes following hot on the heels of a successful World Cup in which Root was England’s highest run maker with 556.</p>

      <p>And while the quality of Root’s batting and his ability is not in question, he knows that a fresh start alongside new head coach Chris Silverwood is the perfect time for him to up his output and lead the way for England to post giant totals.</p>
      <p>Root said: “I’ve done quite a lot of work on my batting over the last month and feel there’s been quite a significant shift in certain areas of it.</p>
      <p>“I think when you’re not concerned about areas of your game that unlocks a lot of things as well.</p>
      <p>“You have the clarity and clear mind to just go and play. So hopefully that’ll play a big part starting from this series and then I can go and get some big runs.</p>
      <p>“One thing you look for in Test matches and what wins you Test matches is scoring big runs.”</p>

      <p>The area that Root has been working on is to help him be less susceptible to the ball that nips back at him and has a knack of trapping him lbw or bowling him through the gate.</p>
      <p>To that end he has spent time with an old friend Josh Varley who is the captain and coach at Root’s club Sheffield Collegiate, and who has been giving him all the throwdowns in the world to get ready for the challenge of Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Root will bat at four in the two-Test series that begins next Thursday, and after watching Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley get off to the perfect start with hundreds in the first warm up match, the 28-year-old is looking forward to walking out to bat a little later than he has done recently.</p>

      <p>He added: “Of course once the Test matches come round it’s all be very different, but I thought the template and the tempo of how we went about batting was much more like how I want to see us play in future.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere the tempo of Root’s batting in T20 cricket will be up for debate soon enough with his hopes of making the T20 World Cup squad in Australia next year far from secure.</p>
      <p>“There’s a huge amount of depth there,” he said. “If I’m not part of that best team I’ll drive myself to improve and get in it. My goal is to try to make sure I’m in the best XI and if I’m not, I'm in the squad.”</p>
