      <p>The next-generation <b>BMW M3</b> sedan has been spied during testing on public roads in Europe.</p>
      <p>Compared to earlier prototypes, this latest car has no false panels covering the headlights. Rather than using the notched units present on the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/3-series/">3 Series</a> sedan and wagon, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/m3/">M3's</a> seem awfully similar to ones spied on <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/4-series/">4 Series</a> prototypes.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/802886/2020-bmw-4-series-front-end-leaked/">leaked photo</a>, the new 4 Series sports a tall and narrow double-kidney grille, like the one on the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-concept-4/">Concept 4</a> coupe at the Frankfurt motor show.</p>
      <p>Although there's still plenty of disguise around the car's air intakes, it's possible both the M3 and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/m4/">M4</a> will share the controversial 328-inspired grille.</p>
      <p>Today's prototype also features the line's signature wing mirrors, and four snarling exhaust tips poking out of the rear bumper. Mind you, we've already seen the car's rear-end design completely undisguised thanks to <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/802095/2020-bmw-m3-leaked/">a leak</a> in October.</p>

      <p>Last month Markus Flasch, head of the BMW M division, confirmed the M3 and M4 won't go on sale globally <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/804281/bmw-m3-m4-delayed-2021/">until 2021</a>.</p>
      <p>The new high-performance sedan and two-door models will be available with a manual transmission, as well as rear- and all-wheel drive variants.</p>
      <p>Details about the powertrain have yet to be revealed, but Flasch promised they "will have the most powerful engine in the segment".</p>
      <p>Power is believed to come from the 'S58' 3.0-litre turbocharged six-cylinder family used in the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-x3-m/">X3 M</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-x4-m/">X4 M</a>, both of which top out with 375kW of power and 600Nm of torque.</p>
      <p>By way of comparison the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/alfa-romeo-giulia-quadrifoglio/">Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio</a> has 375kW/600Nm from its 2.9-litre V6, while the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mercedes-amg/c63/">Mercedes-AMG C63 S</a> boasts 375kW/700Nm from its 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8.</p>
