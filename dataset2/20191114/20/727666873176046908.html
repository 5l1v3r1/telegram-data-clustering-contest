          <i>"And I'll still tell the world I'm in love with you/ 'Cause I ain't ashamed of s##t/ Got your name tatted on my wrist/ Any b##ch got a bone to pick and knows phone to hit/ 'Cause I'm still with all the actions and all that s##t/ You're still my love, you're still my heart, that's still my date/ Still wanna be Mrs. Jackson."</i>
