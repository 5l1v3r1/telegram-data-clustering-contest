      <p>Apple's Apple News+ launched earlier this year with impressive initial subscriber counts, but the company has failed to bring in significant numbers since then.</p>

      <p>When it launched in March, <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/apple_news">Apple News+</a> had wrangled more than 200,000 subscriptions in its first two days. Since then, the company has struggled to gain new subscribers, according to those familiar with the subject.<br/><br/>Apple News+ costs customers <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/26/hands-on-with-apple-news----is-it-worth-the-monthly-fee">$9.99 a month,</a> the same cost as <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/apple_music">Apple Music</a>, and gives customers access to over 300 curated publications. Publications included are <i>People</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and paywalled versions of popular online news sites. <br/><br/>However, the subscribers don't seem to be rolling in, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/apple-news-has-struggled-to-add-subscribers-since-march-launch.html">according</a> to <i>CNBC</i>. One publisher had told them his company received somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 per month in revenue, a number that was far lower than initially expected. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, another publisher disclosed that while subscription revenue was lower than expected, it had brought in a different demographic of readers that skewed younger and more female. The same publisher had also said that advertising revenue from Apple News, a free news service from Apple, has consistently trended upwards. <br/><br/>Publisher revenue is an issue Apple is reportedly attempting to improve, with one <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/28/apple-looks-to-rejigger-apple-news-as-publishers-carp-over-low-revenues-unfinished-product">June report</a> indicating it is seeking input from participating publishers to tweak the service. At that time, publishers who were allegedly advised by Apple they would see ten times the revenue of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/12/apple-buys-iphone-and-ipad-digital-magazine-subscription-service-texture">Apple acquisition Texture</a> in its first year of operation, one publishing executive claimed "it's one-twentieth of what they said. It isn't coming true." <br/><br/>Apple News is, however, starting to pay off for some <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/08/07/apple-news-is-beginning-to-pay-off-for-some-european-publishers">European publishers</a>, despite the relatively small number of countries offering Apple News+. An August report revealed publishers were seeing increased revenues from being on the basic Apple News service, including some where ad impressions had tripled while revenue doubled. <br/><br/>A report on Thursday had claimed that Apple is including a section in deals signed, telling publishers that it reserves the right to bundle services in the future. Sources familiar with the matter say that <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/14/apple-music-news-apple-tv-bundle-being-considered-for-2020-release">Apple may roll out these bundles in 2020,</a> in an attempt to get more people to subscribe. This would likely give users the option to subscribe to Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple News+ for one lower monthly rate.</p>
