      <h2>Facebook has said it will not allow politicians to set up new accounts on the platform if they have previously been banned, according to a statement obtained from the social media company by Breitbart News.</h2>

      <p>Breitbart News reached out to Facebook after learning that the platform was blocking a Republican congressional candidate’s attempt to set up an official campaign page.</p>
      <p>The candidate, Laura Loomer, is running in the Republican primary for the House of Representatives in Florida’s 21st district. She previously had her personal accounts on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram banned under the company’s “dangerous individual” policy. Loomer says the label is defamatory and is <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/09/18/facebook-admits-its-a-publisher-in-court-filings/">contesting it in court</a>.</p>
      <p>President Trump <a href="https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2019/11/01/florida-democrats-say-trumps-move-to-florida-shows-significance-of-sunshine-state-in-2020-election">declared Mar-a-Lago, Florida as his permanent residence earlier this year</a>, meaning that the President and First Lady will cast their votes in FL-21.</p>
      <p>Her campaign attempted to set up a campaign page on Tuesday, providing Facebook with the required data from the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) to verify that she is a declared Republican candidate. Within hours of the account being set up by Loomer’s campaign, it had been blacklisted by Mark Zuckerberg’s company.</p>
      <p>In response to a request for comment by Breitbart News, a Facebook spokesman confirmed that Loomer would not be allowed to set up a campaign page.</p>
      <p>“People who have been banned from our services aren’t able to set up a new account even if they’re running for office,” said the spokesman.</p>
      <p>In a speech last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/18/mark-zuckerberg-says-facebook-wont-censor-politicians-after-censoring-politicians/">promised that his company would not censor politicians.</a></p>
      <p>“We think people should be able to hear what politicians have to say,” said Zuckerberg. “I don’t think it’s right for tech companies to censor politicians in a democracy.”</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg has also said he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/21/mark-zuckerberg-claims-facebook-disrupted-more-than-50-election-interference-campaigns-in-2019/">won’t ban ads</a> from political candidates on his platform — but you need a Facebook account in order to run an ad.</p>
      <p>Karen Giorno, a senior adviser to the campaign, said Facebook’s banning of the campaign page constitutes “blatant election interference.”</p>
      <p>“Facebook’s actions are extremely disturbing and require immediate correction,” said Giorno.</p>
      <p>By allowing some political candidates and not others to reach voters through its platform, Facebook could run afoul of FEC regulations about “in-kind contributions.”</p>
      <p>When it was revealed that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and other Republican politicians were being covertly censored by Twitter in 2018, Gaetz <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/07/27/matt-gaetz-files-fec-complaint-against-twitter-over-shadowban/">filed a complaint with the FEC</a> alleging the uneven treatment constituted an undeclared contribution to their political opponents.</p>
