      <p>She is set to begin her new role on Jan. 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>"I'm passionate about horse racing, particularly on the jumps side and the absolute pinnacle of that is Cheltenham," Tindall said in a statement on The Jockey Club website https://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk/cheltenham/media/press-releases/2019/11/zara-tindall-mbe-to-become-cheltenham-racecourse-director.</p>
      <p>"Racing is simply the most exciting sport and it's open to all. It's an honour... to get involved in a more formal capacity and I look forward to doing my bit to support the executive team in the years to come."</p>
      <p>Tindall, who won a gold medal in the 2006 eventing world championships in Aachen, Germany, will also help to promote Britain's equestrian team ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
