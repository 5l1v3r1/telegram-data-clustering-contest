      <h1>Tom Brady tells trainer he can play until he's 46 or 47</h1>

      <p>At the ripe old age of 42, Tom Brady is still playing quarterback at a high level in the NFL, and it doesn’t sound like the six-time Super Bowl champion is ready to hang up his cleats anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Brady has said in the past that he’d like to play until he’s 45, but he might actually be a thinking a year or two longer than that based on discussions he’s had with his trainer.</p>
      <p>“It all comes to commitment, really,” Brady’s longtime trainer, Alex Guerrero, <a href="https://weei.radio.com/blogs/ryan-hannable/alex-guerrero-discusses-relationship-bill-belichick">said in a radio interview on WEEI Thursday</a>. “No one thought you could play at the elite level in your late 30s, early 40s. That is something we always felt we could do. I have really wanted to be there to help him accomplish that goal. I certainly do believe that 45 is a very realistic goal.</p>
      <p>“We talk about it all the time. Every year he just adds another year. He goes in and he’s like, ‘Guys, I feel so good still. I think I am going to go till 45.’ I am like, ‘OK.’ Now he’s like, ‘Alex, I think I can go like 46 or 47.’”</p>
      <p>It’s a well-known fact that Brady keeps himself in great shape, so it doesn’t come as a surprise to hear that he could play into his late 40s. The question is: Will he still be playing for the Patriots? There’s been talk that <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/patriots/news/adam-schefter-returning-to-patriots-is-least-likely-option-for-tom-brady-in-2020/">he could leave New England after this season</a>, but we’ll have to wait and see about that.</p>
