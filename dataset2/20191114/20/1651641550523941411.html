      <p>Players must help the twins navigate their memories, shaping what they can remember in the present. One of the twins, Tyler, is a transgender man.</p>
      <p>In a press release, game director Florent Guillaume, said that “We love them both, and we are especially grateful to Microsoft for its full support, openness and help regarding Tyler’s identity and character, as a transgender man.”</p>
      <p>Nick Adams, Director of Transgender Representation at GLAAD added that “Tyler is a fully-realized, endearing character, whose story is not reduced to simplistic trans tropes. Creating a playable lead trans character – and taking such care to get it right – raises the bar for future LGBTQ inclusion in gaming.”</p>
      <p>All chapters of Tell Me Why will be out on Xbox One in summer 2020.</p>
