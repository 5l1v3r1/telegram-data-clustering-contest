      <h2>EastEnders viewers think Phil Mitchell will believe Lisa Fowler, after she told him he isn't the father of Sharon's baby</h2>

      <p>EastEnders fans were given a shock on Thursday night, as Phil Mitchell was told he wasn't the father of Sharon's baby.</p>
      <p>Viewers had been led to believe the truth would all come out on Christmas Day, leading to a "bloodbath" and explosive scenes for the family.</p>
      <p>Sharon cheated on husband Phil last year with Keanu Taylor, before the pair had another fling earlier this year - with Sharon falling pregnant.</p>
      <p>Keanu is engaged to Phil's daughter Louise who is also pregnant with his baby.</p>
      <p>In the fallout to Mel Owen's tragic death on Thursday, Lisa didn't hold back and told Phil the truth about Sharon.</p>

      <p>While she still has no idea her son-in-law Keanu is the father, she confessed to Phil that Mel had told her Sharon's baby wasn't his.</p>
      <p>Phil didn't know how to react and simply looked at Lisa confused, before Sharon ordered her to leave.</p>
      <p>Lisa then repeated her claims while viewers will have to wait until Monday to find out if he believes her.</p>

      <p>Some viewers are expecting him to hit the roof, while others think he will be convinced not to believe Lisa.</p>
      <p>Either way, fans got more than they bargained for tonight given there's still a good few weeks to go until Christmas and part of the baby twist has already been exposed.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> fans shared their theories over whether Phil might have something up his sleeve, convinced the look on his face and the lack of denial from Sharon - not to mention her selling her share of the club for no reason - could mean he believes Lisa.</p>

      <p>One viewer said: "Phil definitely believes Lisa, even though Sharon will try to play it off you can tell by his face a part of him knows there’s truth to it."</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "UH OH PHIL KNOWS!! he knows lisa is telling the truth...sheanu your days are numbered."</p>

      <p>A third agreed: "Phil’s face he believes Lisa."</p>
      <p>Others were surprised by the early reveal, adding: "So Phil already knows the baby isn’t his? What the hell is going to happen at Christmas then?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "F**king hell, what’s going to happen at Christmas then?"</p>
