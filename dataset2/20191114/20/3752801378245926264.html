      <p>At least four people were injured in a shooting at a high school north of Los Angeles on Thursday, triggering a police hunt for the suspect who was later taken into custody.</p>
      <p>Police and ambulances swarmed the area around Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, 65km north of Los Angeles, after the early morning shooting sent panicked children running from the area.</p>
      <p>"Update regarding the shooting at #SaugusHigh, suspect is in custody and being treated at a local hospital," tweeted Los Angeles Country Sheriff Alex Villanueva.</p>
      <p>The suspect was described as a male Asian. Local media reports said he was 15 years old.</p>
      <p>Officials at the nearby Henry Mayo Hospital in Valencia said they were treating a total of four patients from the high school - three of whom were in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Bob Boese, speaking on the local NBC news channel, cautioned that it was not clear if all victims had been located.</p>
      <p>"Our deputies are doing a systematic search of the campus," Boese said. He said one weapon had so far been recovered.</p>
      <p>The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's department had earlier tweeted that it believed there was only one suspect involved.</p>
      <p>A White House spokesman said President Donald Trump is "monitoring the ongoing reports."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Always been worried'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aerial video from the local NBC affiliate showed students with hands raised being escorted by officers from the building, and led to a nearby church, as others stood outside the perimeter on their cell phones.</p>
      <p>Denzel Abesamis, a student at the school, told the Los Angeles Times he was arriving at campus when he saw classmates fleeing the scene.</p>
      <p>He called a friend who was hiding in a classroom with five other students.</p>
      <p>"I've always been worried about something like this would happen since it was my actual school," he said, adding that the school had been locked down due to reports of a threat a few years earlier.</p>
      <p>"Saugus has emphasised the importance of making sure to always be cautious of anything that may happen like an active shooter," he said.</p>
      <p>At least three ambulances were at the school campus, opposite a residential area, along with dozens of squad cars.</p>
      <p>Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were among those responding.</p>
      <p>The Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's department had warned residents to stay clear of the area.</p>
      <p>California senator Kamala Harris, a Democratic candidate for the 2020 election, said she was "heartbroken and praying for Santa Clarita".</p>
      <p>"Our children and communities are being terrorised. We can't accept this," she tweeted.</p>
