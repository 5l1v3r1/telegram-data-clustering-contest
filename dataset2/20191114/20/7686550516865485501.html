      <p>A Welsh council spent £30,000 on new gates to stop rough sleeping outside its offices.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/wrexham-council">Wrexham council</a> was criticised after installing black metal gates at its Guildhall headquarters and offices on Lambpit Street.</p>
      <p>Homeless charity Shelter Cymru and local group Wrexham Homeless said the money should have been spent on helping the homeless.</p>
      <p>But the council has defended the move saying it was in response to complaints from the public about anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>The council's chief executive, Ian Bancroft, said: "The issue of installing fencing was due to a specific problem of rough sleepers and was taken forward as a result of complaints from the public due to anti-social behaviour and the issue of risk to staff and the public.</p>
      <p>"This work has been done alongside the actions taken to support individuals into sustainable housing solutions ."</p>

      <p>Speaking outside the gates, a member of the public agreed with the council.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/shock-council-spends-30000-gates-17255569">NorthWalesLive</a>: "It's about time. They have put them there to stop the homeless sleeping there.</p>
      <p>"I have seen all kinds of mess outside the building including human faeces. It was disgusting.</p>
      <p>"It looks a lot better now and I don't have concerns about the cost, it had to be done."</p>
      <p>But a Shelter Cymru spokesman said: "The use of hostile architecture in certain spaces chimes with a wider intolerance of people sleeping rough. It sends a message to people who are vulnerable and in desperate situations that they are not wanted. At the most all it achieves is to push a visible issue out of sight.</p>
      <p>"We believe that everyone is entitled to a safe, secure and affordable home.</p>
      <p>"The resources spent on designing, installing and maintaining these barriers would be better spent on addressing the root causes of homelessness to prevent it from occurring in the first place; and ensuring that where it does occur, meaningful solutions are on offer."</p>

      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/wrexham">Wrexham</a> Homeless said they were "shocked" by the move.</p>
      <p>"Wouldn't it be better spent tackling the issues instead of putting up gates?" he said.</p>
      <p>"l am sure the £30,000 could be better spent by facing the issues and dealing with them in the correct manner."</p>
      <p>The spokesman added: "Other towns have done similar things and all it does is move the problem to other areas and makes it very unsafe for vulnerable people exposing them to attacks.</p>
      <p>"Many street people are vulnerable and congregate in such areas because they are well lit and busy through the night .</p>
      <p>"Erecting gates will make these people even more vulnerable, removing shelter and a place of relative safety. It is very unfortunate that Wrexham council chooses to spend this amount of money in this way.</p>
      <p>"That could go towards some emergency accommodation or supporting street people in an empty building over the winter, of which Wrexham has many".</p>
      <p>Wrexham council has cut £62m since 2008 and reduced the workforce by more than 600 people and faces further budget cuts of between £5.5m to £7.2m in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Wrexham is still struggling with a homeless problem. In March this year <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/homeless-rough-sleeping-begging-cardiff-16992295">Wrexham had the highest number of homeless deaths in Wales</a>.</p>
