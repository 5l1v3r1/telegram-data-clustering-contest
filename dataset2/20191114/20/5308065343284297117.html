      <p>China on Thursday completed a test of its Mars exploration lander ahead of Beijing’s first mission to the red planet slated for 2020.</p>
      <p>Beijing is pouring billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s hovering and obstacle-avoidance test, which took place in northern Hebei province, was conducted in a facility that simulated conditions on Mars.</p>
      <p>A red platform with steel cables attached mimicked the planet’s gravity — about a third that of Earth — as the lander descended from a tall, metal structure.</p>

      <p>The test is “an important part” of China’s plans to land on Mars, said Zhang Kejian, director of the China National Space Administration (CNSA).</p>
      <p>“Currently, all development work is going smoothly,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>China is pushing to catch up with the United States and become a space power, with ambitions of a manned lunar landing.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year it made the first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon, deploying a rover on the surface.</p>
      <p>Experts said Thursday’s successful landing test was key in planning the future mission.</p>
      <p>“I’m pretty optimistic about China’s 2020 Mars exploration mission,” said Jiao Weixin, a professor at the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University.</p>
      <p>“Hovering and avoiding obstacles is very key to whether or not the probe can land safely,” added Jiao.</p>
      <p>If the landing fails, so does the entire expedition, he said.</p>
      <p>International cooperation<br/>China’s first Mars mission will focus on “orbiting and landing” on the planet, where a craft will “perform a patrol survey on the surface”, said Zhang Rongqiao, the mission’s chief designer, at Thursday’s test.</p>
      <p>“After the probe is launched, it will take seven months to reach Mars,” he added.</p>
      <p>The final landing process will only last about seven minutes, but is “the most difficult and the most challenging part of the whole mission”.</p>
      <p>China now spends more on its civil and military space programmes than Russia and Japan, and is second only to the United States.</p>
      <p>Although opaque, its 2017 budget was estimated at $8.4 billion by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
      <p>The CNSA emphasised Beijing’s desire to collaborate with other countries and institutions at Thursday’s test, which was observed by dozens of diplomats and foreign journalists.</p>
      <p>China has plans for future space missions, including “asteroid exploration missions and many more lunar missions”, said Zhang, the CNSA director.</p>
      <p>“Let us join hands in making an effort to advance space technology,” he said.</p>
