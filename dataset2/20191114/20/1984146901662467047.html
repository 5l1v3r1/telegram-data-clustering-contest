      <p>Here are your top <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> stories for November 14:</p>
      <h3>Schar's 'role' over Xhaka</h3>
      <p>Newcastle have been linked with a move for Arsenal's Grant Xhaka this January - and there are claims his Swiss team-mate <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fabian-schar">Fabian Schar</a> could play a role in any deal.</p>
      <p>While the United defender hasn't linked up with his country due to a knee injury, the Telehgraph report that he has a close relationship with the Arsenal midfielder, and could be used in a bid to lure him to Tyneside.</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa facing keeper problems</h3>
      <p>Newcastle go to Aston Villa on Monday, November 25 for their first Premier League fixture after the international break.</p>
      <p>But the hosts are set to be without their first and second-choice goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>No 1 Tom Heaton had to pull out of the England squad with an injury while Jed Steer was forced off in their 2-1 defeat to Wolves.</p>
      <h3>Louis Saha on Newcastle loan deal</h3>
      <p>Former Premier League winner Louis Saha has revealed he feels more allegiance to Newcastle than he does towards Sunderland - despite featuring for both clubs during his career.</p>
      <p>Saha joined Newcastle on a half-season loan deal in 1999 from French side Metz and was part of the side that reached the FA Cup final. He scored one goal in 11 games before he returned to France.</p>
      <p>“I had a better experience at Newcastle,” said Saha.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t play at Sunderland – I didn’t like what happened to me in terms of chances I had there.”</p>
      <h3>Lascelles injury confirmed</h3>
      <p>Newcastle skipper <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jamaal-lascelles">Jamaal Lascelles</a> will be out of action until 2020 after Newcastle United confirmed the extent of his injury.</p>
