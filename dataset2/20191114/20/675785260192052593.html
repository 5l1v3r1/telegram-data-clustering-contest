      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: British charity Tree Aid work across Ghana, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia to grow trees across the drylands of Africa in support of the Great Green Wall campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:58:58+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author">Rhian Lubin, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Homes and farmlands destroyed by floods and desertification paint a grim picture of how the climate crisis has gripped countries like Ghana. But there is a possible solution that is already helping communities on the climate front lines in Africa to thrive. Trees. . . and lots of them.</p>
      <p>The Great Green Wall Sahara and Sahel Initiative is an African-led movement of 21 countries with the epic ambition to grow an 8,000km natural wonder, spanning from Senegal in the west to Somalia in the east.</p>
      <p>It could be the lifeline the continent – and the planet – needs for future generations to survive the changes the climate crisis will bring.</p>
      <p>By 2030 the hope is the Great Green Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet, three times the size of the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
      <p>We joined British charity Tree Aid, who work across five of the 21 countries – Ghana, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia.</p>

      <p>We saw the vital work they do, partnered with the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, to grow trees across the drylands of Africa in support of the Great Green Wall campaign.</p>
      <p>“Climate change is real. It’s here with us, it’s evident when riding through the communities,” Tree Aid project officer Robert Atawura says on a visit to the Daka River in Yendi, a small town in the Northern Region of Ghana.</p>
      <p>“In the early months of the year, where we walked along the river, the whole river was dried up. Farmers’ yields are low because the rains are not as consistent. That’s as a result of land degradation and cutting down the trees.</p>
      <p>“But when I come back to the communities I’ve worked in previous years, I see how the trees are picking up and growing up. Vegetation is good here now.</p>

      <p>“Even though there is climate change, we will overcome it with the activities we are doing.</p>
      <p>“We believe when you plant a tree you can help individuals and communities out of poverty.</p>
      <p>“You can get a lot from trees. This is how we save the planet.”</p>
      <p>Tree Aid’s project along the Daka River is helping to plant over 200,000 trees and regenerating 125,000 trees with local communities.</p>
      <p>Last year the charity planted nearly a million trees in Ghana and regenerated even more along 72km of the river.</p>
      <p>This will improve water availability, increase biodiversity, soil fertility and soil stability and decrease land erosion.</p>

      <p>Here, to coincide with our Million Mirror Trees campaign, I planted my own Cassia tree with the help of local woman Sena Wumbei.</p>
      <p>Men and women of the local community work together to plant the trees. The men do the digging and the women the planting.</p>
      <p>Balancing a very heavy bucket of baby Cassia trees on your head and digging holes in the 37C sun is by no means an easy job, but the community are dedicated to the venture.</p>
      <p>The increase in trees will help to produce dawadawa fruits and seeds, mangoes and cashews, which communities can eat or sell to generate an income. Sena says: “The trees we are planting will protect the Daka River so we can continue to get water from it.</p>
      <p>“It is the only source of drinking water for me and my family but it is drying up.”</p>
      <p>Robert shows me a Cassia tree planted just a year earlier which is already a foot above my head and says: “You can see how quickly they grow. The trees are all growing very well.”</p>

      <p>In the town of Paga, a few hours’ drive away on the Burkina Faso border, Tree Aid has revolutionised the process of shea butter making for local women by providing them with modern equipment and machinery.</p>
      <p>One of them, Benedicta Dechangedaani Awolowu, says it has changed their lives.</p>
      <p>Before, the women would have to walk a 20km round trip to the market to sell firewood they chopped from trees.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old says: “With firewood, there is no guarantee anyone would buy it at the market. It is a 10km walk there and back. So we’d carry it on our heads all that way and if no one wanted it, we’d walk back again. It’s not a sustainable option.</p>
      <p>“We know the importance of the trees, but if we cannot find any food to eat, we’re not thinking about anything else.</p>
      <p>“As we’re cutting the trees, we know the damage we are causing. But we didn’t have much choice. It is a cycle.”</p>
      <p>Thanks to Tree Aid, the shea butter making process is much more efficient, meaning the women can run a proper enterprise on site taking in huge orders from European companies. Shea butter, used in cooking and beauty products, gives people here an alternative income to cutting down the shea trees to sell firewood or charcoal.</p>
      <p>It is a team effort, with the women then splitting the profits between them.</p>

      <p>“Life is much better now,” Benedicta says. “Previously, this process would take days, but with this equipment now we can do 10 big bags of shea fruits in two days. Now we have orders placed by companies which means our income is bigger.</p>
      <p>“We can save money to support our children to go to school. If someone’s sick we can pay to send them to hospital, if we need food we can use this income to buy food.”</p>
      <p>It’s a big step in the right direction, but the communities know they’re not out of the woods by any means. As the women are busy preparing the next order of shea, it is 36C in the shade – and they tell me this is relatively cool compared to the peak dry seasons, which are getting hotter and hotter every year.</p>
      <p>Benedicta says: “When I got married here 35 years ago, three months after Christmas the rain would always come.</p>
      <p>“Now, it’s seven months after Christmas. It has a huge influence on our crops. The heat is unbearable for most of the year now.</p>
      <p>“We worry a lot about our children and the future, but that is why we are planting trees.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t continue in this way, yes it will be extremely difficult for our children and grandchildren. We want to bring the vegetation back. I might not have long left, and I won’t see the benefits of a tree for many years after.</p>
      <p>“But because of the worry about my children and my grandchildren I am putting my efforts into planting the trees.”</p>
