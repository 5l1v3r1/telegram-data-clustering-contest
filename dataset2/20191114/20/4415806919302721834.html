      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:46:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/cormac-okeeffe/" target="_blank">By Cormac O'Keeffe</a></address>
      <p>The Criminal Assets Bureau has seized six cars, three luxury watches, six designer handbags and almost €19,000 in cash in an operation targeting criminal associates in the Midlands.</p>
      <p>The four men targeted, aged 28, 29, 38 and 40, are all based in Longford town and are suspected of being significant players in the Midlands drugs market.</p>
      <p>They are all married into a notorious extended criminal family in Longford and Westmeath. Two of the men are understood to be themselves related.</p>
      <p>A total of 21 searches across eight counties were conducted, including five house and 16 business premises.</p>

      <p>CAB was assisted by the Emergency Response Unit, the Armed Response Unit from the Western Division and local gardaí attached to Longford Garda District.</p>
      <p>The searches were conducted in Longford, Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, Tipperary, Cavan, Roscommon and Dublin.</p>
      <p>One of the men was arrested by local gardaí under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud) Offences Act, 2001.</p>
      <p>The following items were seized: a 191 Ford Focus; two 181 Ford Focus; a 181 Ford Ranger; aTuffMac car trailer; a car towing dolly; three Rolex watches; six designer handbags; €18,600 in cash and 42 fake €20 notes (€840 in total).</p>

      <p>Bureau officers also took away financial documents, computers, mobile phones and drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>The CAB operation stems from the work of a local asset profiler in Longford. There are 427 such profilers nationwide currently, compared to 378 at the end of 2018 and 259 at the end of 2017.</p>
      <p>CAB conducted a nationwide tour of local joint policing committees across the country in 2017 and 2018.</p>

      <p>Recent figures show that CAB has 24 targets in the Roscommon/Longford Division, an increase from 14 at the end of last year.</p>
      <p>It currently has 34 targets in the Laois/Offaly Division, compared to 22 at the close of 2018. It has 18 targets in the Westmeath Division, compared to 15 last December.</p>
      <p>The increase reflects a nationwide trend and stems in part from the rise in local profilers.</p>
      <p>CAB has conducted 48 searches so far this year, double their planned amount at the start of the year – reflecting a rise in caseload.</p>
