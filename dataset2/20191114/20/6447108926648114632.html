        <i>Original Story.</i>
      </p>
      <p>It looks like Ninja Theory’s Microsoft exclusive Bleeding Edge, the online brawler, will be out on March 24th according to a now deleted store page for the game from the Microsoft site. It’s very likely then that the release date is something that is going to be confirmed tonight at the XO19 conference. Alongside the release date there will be two closed betas as well, with one set to take place on February 14th and another one on March 13th.</p>

      <p>Those who pre-order Bleeding Edge or play the game in its first week of launch will receive the Punk Pack. This includes three fighter skins including Punk Rock Nidhoggr, Butterpunk Buttercup, Outrider ZeroCool, a rioter’s hoverboard, bonus taunts, and a make your mark sticker park. Bleeding Edge will be available through Xbox GamePass.</p>
