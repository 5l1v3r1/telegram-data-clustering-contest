      <p>When the bodies of four members of the Clutter family were discovered in a farm house in November 1959 it sparked a major manhunt and inspired a renowned work of literature</p>
      <p>It was early in the morning and teens Bobby and Paul Irsik were going about their normal chores. Their father, Vic Irsik, was a hired hand on a farm owned by Herb Clutter and he had given his sons the task of milking two of Clutter’s cows.</p>
      <p>The boys finished the milking and, as usual, took the milk up to the farm house to put it into a cream separator in Clutter’s utility room.</p>
      <p>The boys went about their task as quickly as possible, eager to get away to hunt pheasant on another part of the property. They were always taught not to “snoop” around in the Clutter family’s home and this time was no different. They left the house and went on their way, without noticing anything was amiss. But had they disobeyed just this once they would have made a grisly discovery. Instead, that discovery was left to Nancy Ewalt and Susan Kidwell, teenage friends of Herbert’s daughter Nancy, who had come to take her with them to church. They found four members of the Clutter family murdered in their home.</p>

      <p>It was November 15, 1959, 60 years ago today, when the girls made their horrific discovery. It sparked a major manhunt and the arrest of two ex-convicts for the murder.</p>
      <p>It would have remained just another local crime had it not been for the fact that author Truman Capote read about it and turned it into a seminal work of “true crime”, the “nonfiction novel” titled In Cold Blood. It was a bestseller and started an American obsession with true crime.</p>
      <p>Clutter was born in 1911 in Kansas. He grew up on a farm and was passionate about making that his life. He studied agriculture at Kansas State College, getting his bachelor degree in 1933. In 1934 he married Bonnie Fox (who was born in 1914) and their first child Eveanna was born in 1936. In 1939 a second daughter Beverly was born and they moved to Holcomb where they began farming.</p>
      <p>A third daughter Nancy was born in 1943 and a son Kenyon was born in 1944. Herb became a well-respected member of the local community. He was a founder of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers, served as a member of the Agriculture Department’s Price Stabilisation Board and in 1954 was appointed to the Federal Farm Credit Board. Meanwhile, his farm was doing well, but he was not rolling in money.</p>

      <p>But a former farmhand, Floyd Wells, seemed to think Clutter was rich. While serving time with petty criminal Dick Hickock, he talked about seeing Clutter handling a lot of money. When he was released in 1959 Hickock talked his friend Perry Smith, who he had met in prison, into helping him rob the Clutter farm. On the night of November 14 they entered the Clutter family home, woke the family and demanded the father open his safe.</p>
      <p>But there was no safe and no piles of cash. In the early hours of November 15, Smith and Hickock bound, gagged and murdered the family, Herb’s throat was cut before he was shot in the head. The others were all shot. It was partly out of rage and partly because the</p>
      <p>men were determined to leave no witnesses. They left with a radio, less than $50 in cash and a pair of binoculars.</p>
      <p>After the bodies of the family were discovered, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation launched a major investigation under Alvin Dewey. Among those questioned were Nancy Clutter’s boyfriend Bobby Rupp, who is believed to have been the last person to see the family.</p>
      <p>At the time award-winning author Capote read an article about the crime and decided it would be a great subject for his next book. He travelled to Kansas with his cousin Nelle Harper Lee (author of To Kill A Mockingbird) and interviewed police and locals.</p>

      <p>A breakthrough in the case came when Wells heard about the crime and told police about his time in prison with Hickock. Hickock and Smith had long since fled, making their way across the country, spending time in Mexico, before they were finally arrested in Nevada on December 30.</p>
      <p>A hastily concocted alibi about being with prostitutes on the night of the murder fell apart and at their trial in March 1960 they tried to mount a defence of temporary insanity. But the jury took less than an hour to find them guilty.</p>
      <p>During their time on death row, Capote was allowed to interview the men, gathering material for his book, which was published in 1965, after the men were both executed by hanging in April of that year. The book was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and has been adapted to both films and TV series.</p>
      <p>Capote was later criticised for inaccuracies in the book, including invented scenes and dialogue.</p>
