      <p>He are some of the responses we received on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WolvesFCNewsAndChat/">Facebook</a> page...</p>
      <p><b>Simon James Scrivens:</b> Defence by a mile - Boly and Bennett are injured, which means we have Coady, Saiss and Dendoncker in there... all of which we signed as midfielders.</p>
      <p><b>Craig Neale:</b> Still think we need another striker so we don’t burn Raul out. Cutrone will come good in time but the games are going to come thick and fast and extremely tough especially if we get into the knock outs in Europe and want to have another crack at the FA Cup. Maybe a defender too as I don’t think we’re going to see much of a fully match fit Boly again this season.</p>
      <p><b>Lee Buttery:</b> If we are going to compete with the so called big guns then another defender and a top quality striker.</p>
      <p><b>Phil Smith:</b> Definitely defence and midfield and maybe a striker so basically everywhere lol.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Adam Albrighton:</b> Another striker and our defence.</p>
      <p><b>Ben Smith:</b> Definitely defence and another midfielder.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Smith:</b> Franck Kessie + a cb and maybe another forward.</p>
      <p><b>Carl Watson-Wood:</b> CB, Attacking midfielder, possibly another striker.</p>
      <p><b>Phill Grosvenor:</b> Cdm an atk mid to sure up an stop central play flowing.</p>
      <p><b>Murray Charlie:</b> Striker midfield and defender.</p>
      <p><b>Richard Hickman:</b> Dani Olmo - attacking midfielder.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Belle Stevens:</b> Defence.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Briant:</b> Ruben Dias and Frank Kessie.</p>
      <p><b>Paul Keightley:</b> Defence midfield up front.</p>
      <p><b>Craig Morris:</b> Attacking midfielder, defender and a proven striker.</p>
      <p><b>Paul Stevenson:</b> Bowen from Hull, Foden on loan, Dias for 60 mill.</p>

      <p><b>Adam Ant:</b> Back 3 .... and someone like Bully.</p>
      <p><b>Stephen Rickhuss-Moore:</b> Defence.</p>
      <p><b>Sylvia Moseley:</b> We need another Bully who scores for fun, and backup in defence.</p>
      <p><b>Jay Bennett:</b> Tall defender to defend set pieces until we get Boly back.</p>
