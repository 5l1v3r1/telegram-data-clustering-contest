        <b><i>Heavy: An American Memoir</i>, by Kiese Laymon</b>
      </p>
      <p>So fresh and mesmerizing, Kiese Laymon’s writing reminded me of the thrill and speed of listening to a musician that reinvents a genre. Every page winded me. </p>

        <b><i>Sabrina</i>, by Nick Drnaso</b>
      </p>
      <p>The story Nick Drnaso tells about the inexplicable violence perpetrated by a young man, filmed, uploaded, and then devoured on social media by the masses, kept me up at night. Even in the wordless frames, I sometimes wanted to cover my eyes or look away. Essential reading for our times. </p>

        <b><i>The</i> <i>Vegetarian</i>, by Han Kang</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scarier than a horror film, I found that I could not read it alone at night. It was the closest I’ve come to giving up the flesh (of animals). </p>

        <b><i>Priestdaddy</i>, by Patricia Lockwood</b>
      </p>
      <p>I recently emailed Patricia Lockwood to ask her a favor even though we do not know each other. That’s the kind of intimacy this excellent memoir about Patricia’s life, and family, fosters in its reader. I wouldn’t just bring this book to the desert island, I’d beg Patricia to shipwreck there with me. </p>

        <b><i>The Folded Clock</i>, by Heidi Julavits</b>
      </p>
      <p>“To be melancholy is to be self-haunted, and among the many reasons this is an unsatisfactory explanation for living inside a jam jar inside an aquarium, foremost among them is that there are no good stories to tell of your bleak time in a beautiful place, and no specter to blame for the fact that happiness, though it should have been inescapable, evaded you.” I want that quote chiseled onto my gravestone. </p>

        <b><i>The Flamethrowers</i>, by Rachel Kushner</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am not a cool person, and this book — daring and smart, with a protagonist so original and fierce — confirmed the above statement in spades. Please read if interested in any or all: motorcycles, New York City in the 1970s, artists, radicals, revolutionaries. </p>

        <b><i>Dept. of Speculation</i>, by Jenny Offill</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are sentences in this book that I’d tattoo on my skin forever. </p>

        <b><i>White</i> <i>Teeth</i>, by Zadie Smith</b>
      </p>
      <p>In my life, there is the time before <i>White Teeth</i>, and the time after <i>White Teeth. </i>Zadie Smith’s writing changed my view of the world, and no offense to Patricia Lockwood, but I would like to ask Zadie to come to the desert island too.</p>

        <b><i>The Invention of Solitude</i>, by Paul Auster</b>
      </p>
      <p>As I’ve struggled to understand the (older) men in my life, I’ve returned to this book often. For anyone with daddy issues. </p>

        <b><i>Fraud</i>, by David Rakoff</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brilliant, clever, and heartbreaking essays. Especially marvelous if you know David’s voice from his work on the radio program <i>This American Life.</i></p>
