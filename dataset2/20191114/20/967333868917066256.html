      <p>According to the Pentagon’s key weapons tester, Robert Behler, the new-generation F-35 jet is still failing to meet full combat readiness targets and, despite some headway on reliability issues, all three versions of the fighter break down “more often than planned”, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/lockheed-s-stealthy-f-35-breaks-down-too-often-pentagon-says">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“The operational suitability of the F-35 fleet remains at a level below service expectations”, Behler said in prepared remarks on Wednesday, addressing two House Armed Services Committee panels.</blockquote>
      <p>Nevertheless, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Programme Manager Greg Ulmer retorted after the hearing that he doesn’t “necessarily agree” with Behler’s conclusions.</p>
      <blockquote>“If you look lot-over-lot, reliability and maintainability is significantly better for the airplanes delivering off the line”, he said, while admitting that there were some issues that they “are going after”.</blockquote>
      <p>Just weeks earlier, the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin announced that they had fulfilled the largest contract in the programme’s history – a deal valued at $34 billion for 478 additional aircraft.</p>
      <p>Despite the manufacturer not having completed all of its due testing, new F-35s worth roughly $27 billion have been placed on contract. For the time being, 458 jets have been crossed out of a list of overall 3,500 planes to be purchased by the US and its allies from as far afield as Australia and Poland. The Pentagon’s approval for full-fledged production, which has now been delayed, is slated for 2020.</p>
