      <h1>Tesla Model 3 nails 0-60 mph in 2.9 sec after OTA software update</h1>

      <p>The Tesla Model 3 Performance variant broke the three-second 0-60 MPH barrier <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-x-3-power-boost-software-update/">after receiving a 5% performance update</a>.</p>
      <p>Popular Tesla YouTuber Brooks Weisblat of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWeLPNowZvdzXwnCDxVyNEg"><i>DragTimes</i></a> shared data from numerous acceleration runs he performed in a Model 3, capturing before and after the 5% power update.</p>
      <p>When he first received his car from Tesla, Weisblat benchmarked the vehicle’s performance in four separate 0-60 MPH runs, noting the fastest time as 3.050 seconds and quicker than Tesla’s advertised 0-60 MPH time of 3.2 seconds. After the update, Weisblat performed four more runs to test acceleration and was able to break the 0-60 MPH three-second barrier by recording a time of 2.998 seconds, giving the vehicle a rough theoretical horsepower increase of 23.7%.</p>
      <p>Weisblat also tested his Model 3 Performance in a quarter-mile assessment. His vehicle’s pre-update time was 11.637 seconds, with a top speed of 115.485 MPH, but <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-drag-race-ota-power-update-comparison/">this time was beaten by the 5% power increase</a>, capturing an 11.486 second time and a top speed of 117.495. “That is a pretty significant top-end increase from 115 to 117,” Weisblat added. “Overall…I think there definitely is a noticeable increase in power. I can’t say driving the car, you actually notice a huge difference, but the numbers right here actually show a little bit of a difference.” He believes if owners utilized lighter wheels or other performance parts that hold less weight, times could be reduced even further, perhaps into the 11.3 second mark for the quarter-mile.</p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk and VP of Technology Drew Baglino first hinted at the over-the-air power update for Model S, Model X, and Model 3 vehicles during the company’s Q3 earnings call in October. “We’re also expecting there is going to be an over-the-air improvement, that will improve the power of the Model S, X, and 3. By the way, it’s coming in a few weeks. It should be on the order of 5% power <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-v10-firmware-smart-summon-release-date-august-2019/">improvement due to improved firmware</a>,” VP of Technology Drew Baglino said. “We are continuing to learn how to optimize motor control in our products. But yes, a 5% improvement for all Model 3 customers, and 3% for S and X,”  The update was not only geared toward power improvements, however, as Tesla also announced there would be positive changes in Supercharging.</p>
      <p>CEO Elon Musk was sure to add his two cents regarding the power and convenience of the company’s utilization of Over-the-Air updates to improve its products. “I don’t think there has ever been a situation in history where you buy a car and it gets way better over time, through software,” Musk said. Updates have provided power improvements like the one tested by Brooks Weisblat. However, Tesla has been able <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-theater-v10-update-mobile-movies/">to add numerous entertainment options</a> through the updates as well, making the Tesla ownership experience new and exciting.</p>
