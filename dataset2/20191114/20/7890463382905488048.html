        <b>X019 has landed, and with it, news that a hearty roster of games is headed to the Xbox Game Pass later this year and throughout 2020. Announced at the event, upcoming games headed to Game Pass on PC include Darksiders III, My Friend Pedro, and a bunch of games from the Final Fantasy series. Ten, in fact.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Final Fantasy titles headed to the Xbox Game Pass (available on PC as well as consoles) are Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII: Remastered, Final Fantasy IX, Final Fantasy X: HD Remastered, Final Fantasy X-2: HD Remastered, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII-2, Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, and Final Fantasy XV. Whew.</p>
      <p>But that’s not all – other titles announced include Darksiders III, Gunfire Games’ hack-and-slash adventure that sees you take on the role of Fury – and take down the seven deadly sins – released November last year. My Friend Pedro, the part-platformer, part-shooter that gets you blasting baddies on the orders of a sentient banana, also makes the list.</p>
      <p>Other titles on the way (in alphabetical order) are Carrion, Cris Tales, Cyber Shadow, Double Kick Heroes, Edge of Eternity, Forager, Haven, It Lurks Below, Levelhead, Phogs, She Dreams Elsewhere, Skatebird, Streets of Rage 4, Scourge Bringer, Touhou Luna Nights, The Red Strings Club (PC only), Vambrace: Cold Soul, and West of Dead.</p>
