      <h1>Market declines; Jollibee slumps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:45:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Manila Standard Business</a></address>
      <p>The stock market slipped Thursday in thin trading, with investors staying on the sidelines ahead of the policy meeting of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas late in the day.</p>
      <p>The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 13.76 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,933.71 on a value turnover P4.2 billion. Losers beat gainers, 107 to 78, with 55 issues unchanged.</p>
      <p>Jollibee Foods Corp. slumped 5 percent to P202.60 after disclosing that it was investing up to $7.8 million in a joint venture company that would develop and operate Tim Ho Wan stores in Shanghai, China.</p>
      <p>Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc. of the Aboitiz Group declined 2.9 percent to P52.80, while DMCI Holdings Inc. of the Consunji Group dropped 2.8 percent to P7.68.</p>
      <p>Casino operator Bloomberry Resorts Corp. of tycoon Enriquez Razon Jr., however, rose 3.1 percent to P11.30.</p>
      <p>The rest of Asian markets fluctuated Thursday with investors shifting cautiously following another Wall Street record as Donald Trump hailed progress in US-China trade talks, while eyes were also on Hong Kong after another night of violent protests.</p>
      <p>Tokyo fell 0.8 percent after data showed Japan’s economy grew at a slower pace than forecast in the third quarter as it was hit by trade wars.</p>
      <p>Taipei eased 0.2 percent, Singapore shed 0.3 percent, Jakarta sank more than one percent and Mumbai was off 0.1 percent.</p>
      <p>But Shanghai added 0.2 percent, Sydney rose 0.6 percent, Seoul edged up 0.4 percent and Wellington put on 0.6 percent.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong tumbled 0.9 percent following another night of unrest in the city, which has seen a pick-up in violence since the weekend as protesters blocked roads in certain districts—closing businesses—and disrupted public transport for a fourth day.</p>
      <p>The standoff has hammered the Hang Seng Index—which had lost around four percent by Wednesday night—while there are concerns about possible intervention by Beijing.</p>
      <p>Trading floors were edgy as a volatile week continued, with very few details from Washington and Beijing on negotiations for their mini tariffs agreement.</p>
      <p>Trump’s comments on Wednesday that “our trade agreement with China is moving along very rapidly” provided some support, though observers said markets were looking for something concrete to buy into.</p>
      <p>“Let’s not forget that as long ago as June we were told that a US-China trade deal was 90 percent of the way there,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.</p>
      <p>“Yet since then we’ve seen new tariffs applied to Chinese goods, albeit with some exemptions, with a new set of tariffs still expected to kick in on December 15.”</p>
      <p>Equities have seen healthy rallies in recent weeks on optimism the two sides would soon reach a partial deal as part of a wider agreement to end their long-running trade war that has hit the global economy.</p>
      <p>Michelle Girard, chief US economist at NatWest Markets, told Bloomberg TV: “We’ve been pushing back on a lot of this trade optimism and it’s felt kind of lonely because markets have certainly embraced the news that we might have a short-term deal. <b>With AFP</b></p>
