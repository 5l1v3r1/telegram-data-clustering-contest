      <p>CONAKRY (Reuters) - A young demonstrator was killed in Guinea on Thursday during protests against President Alpha Conde’s perceived attempt to extend his mandate, the security minister told Reuters.</p>
      <p>At least fourteen people have now died since demonstrations erupted in the West African country last month against changes to the constitution that many fear could allow Conde to seek a third term.</p>
      <p>Rights groups and political opponents have denounced a heavy-handed crackdown by the police including opening fire on protesters, claims that Reuters has been unable to independently verify and that security forces deny.</p>
      <p>Thousands took to the streets of the capital Conakry on Thursday. Images caught on camera showed a bus in flames and protesters clashing with police, who broke up the demonstrations with tear gas.</p>
      <p>The circumstances of the death was not immediately clear. Security minister Damantang Albert Camara said an investigation was underway.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old Conde, whose second and final five-year term expires next year, has refused to rule out running again and asked his government last month to look into drafting a new constitution.</p>
      <p>His opponents fear that could be used as a reset button on his presidency, allowing him to run again like other African leaders who have amended or changed constitutions in recent years to stay in power.</p>
