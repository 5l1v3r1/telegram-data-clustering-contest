      <h1>Obsidian’s first Xbox exclusive is Grounded, a miniature first person co-op survival game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:15:10+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Stefan L</a></address>
      <p>Grounded, the next game from Obsidian Entertainment, has been announced at XO19. It’s a big change of pace for the studio, as Grounded is a miniaturised first person co-op survival game and not a big, grand RPG in the vein of Fallout: New Vegas or The Outer Worlds. As you’ll see from the announcement trailer, it’s got more than a bit of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids to it…</p>

      <p>Grounded is coming to Xbox One and PC in Spring 2020, heading into Xbox Game Preview and with Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft Store, and on Steam.</p>
      <p>The game has shrunk you all down to the size of an ant and task you with surviving in the lawn of a suburban backyard. You’ll be cutting down blades of grass and dandelions, gathering, crafting and building bases with those and other everyday objects found in the environments. You’ll also have to battle with insects that attack your structures.</p>
      <p>Ever since Microsoft brought Obsidian Entertainment into their group of first party Xbox Game Studios, people have been wondering what they’ve been working on. Obsidian were acquired at a time when they were wrapping up development on The Outer Worlds, published by Take Two’s Private Division label, but went straight into Xbox Game Pass at the same time. At the same time, another smaller team within the studio has been working on Grounded, one of several working on different and inventive projects such as this. The project actually started prior to the company joining Microsoft.</p>
      <p>Of course, the company will always be best known for their RPGs, and that’s noted in Grounded’s announcement. They say, “RPGs like The Outer Worlds will always be in Obsidian’s DNA, but from time to time we want to stretch our creative muscles and try things that might be a little different.”</p>
