      <blockquote>A door has opened to The Crypt, one of Purgatory’s many worlds.<br/>Its ever-changing hallways are filled with bone-dust, shadows and undead outlaws<br/>Oh, and keep a lookout for The Wendigo. There’s a bounty on his head. Payout’s a trophy that you will carry with you into the full game.<br/>I’d get movin’. Time’s a-wasting.<br/>Step into the boots of the dead man William Mason (voiced by Ron Perlman) and descend into the grim and gritty world of Purgatory in this fast-paced twin-stick shooter that’ll put your skills to test. Dodge behind cover as you try to outgun your enemies in the unknown procedurally generated hunting grounds. The Wild West has never been this dark.</blockquote>
      <p>The game is currently available in an open beta on Xbox One right now. Players can try out the game until November 25th.<br/>For more X019 news, check out the announcement of Rare’s new game.</p>
