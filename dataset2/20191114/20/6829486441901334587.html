      <h1>Tool Announce Massive Australian Tour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:10:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Tool are having something of an unstoppable 2019.</p>
      <p>The nu-metal legends, most famous for their work in the late ’90s, have been on something of a hiatus for literal years. But just when the culture needed them most, they decided to come swinging back into the fray, armed with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/tool-are-releasing-a-deluxe-edition-of-fear-inoculum-2567602"><i>Fear Inoculum</i></a>, <a href="https://junkee.com/tool-review/220172">an unbearably intense collection of melodic and complex hooks.</a> Basically, it was the sound of Tool at their most classic — but in a way that also felt forward-thinking and fresh, rather than simply deeply reverential of the past.</p>
      <p>Well, to top off the delights of that record, looks like Tool are talking their show on the road.</p>
      <p>Yup, the band are coming to Australia in 2020.</p>
      <p>At this stage, the supports are yet to be announced. But who cares — we’ll still get a full blast of Tool, hitting up every major Australian city.</p>
      <p>Tickets go on sale next Friday November 22. And be warned — they will get snapped up real fast.</p>
