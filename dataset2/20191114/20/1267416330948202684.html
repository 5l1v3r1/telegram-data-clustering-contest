      <h1>Halo: The Master Chief Collection coming to PC in December</h1>
      <h2>The PC version of the MCC will add each Halo game individually, starting with Reach</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T20:50:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/bradly-shankar" target="_blank">Bradly Shankar</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft has confirmed that <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection </i>will release on PC on December 3rd.</p>
      <p><i>The Master Chief Collection </i>will be included in Xbox Game Pass for PC at no additional cost, although it will also be sold on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/halo-the-master-chief-collection/bpk4zkfcfl5g">Microsoft Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/">Steam</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that Microsoft is individually rolling out <i>Halo </i>games to the <i>Master Chief Collection </i>on PC. At launch, the collection will actually only include <i>Halo: Reach. </i>The rest of the <i>Halo </i>franchise will be rolled out in the order they were originally released: <i>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST </i>and <i>Halo 4</i>.</p>
      <p>Microsoft says this release plan gives developers 343 Industries, Splash Damage and Ruffian the time<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/03/12/halo-mcc-coming-to-pc/"> to “ensure each [game] is right”</a> while also letting players jump into specific titles right away, as opposed to waiting for the entire collection to be completed.</p>
      <p>The studios are undoubtedly taking the extra time because <i>The Master Chief Collection </i>experienced a notoriously tumultuous launch on Xbox One in November 2014. Numerous technical issues prevented users from playing online, leading 343 head Bonnie Ross<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2014/11/25/games-a-status-update-from-bonnie-ross-on-halo-the-master-chief-collection/"> to publicly apologize</a> and the studio to make a long-term commitment to improving the overall experience.</p>
      <p>Alongside the PC launch of <i>The Master Chief Collection</i>, Microsoft will also roll out a new version of the game on Xbox One on December 3rd. With the update, the console version of <i>The Master Chief Collection </i>will include <i>Halo: Reach </i>and <i>Halo 3: ODST</i>.</p>
      <p>The latter game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/12/19/7425809/halo-the-master-chief-collection-halo-3-odst-xbox-one">previously offered for free as an apology</a> to those who played <i>The Master Chief Collection </i>during its rocky launch period and later sold separately.</p>
