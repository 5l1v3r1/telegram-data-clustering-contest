      <p>Neymar has reportedly visited Barcelona twice over the past six weeks, and even met up with Lionel Messi and company. According to reports, he also had a clear message for his former teammates.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old seemed desperate to re-join FC Barcelona during the latest transfer window, but the Spanish giants and his current club failed to reach an agreement despite week-long negotiations.</p>
      <p>Gerard <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/gerard-pique-makes-huge-admission-over-neymar-transfer/666428">Pique even revealed</a> that some of Barcelona's key players offered to let their club make alterations to their own salaries in order to accommodate the Brazilian's potential pay cheque without breaking Financial Fair Play rules.</p>
      <p>However, Neymar ended up staying in Paris, and is said to be focused on making the most of the 2019/20 campaign in France.</p>

      <p>He picked up an injury during the previous international break, though, which has seen him sidelined ever since.</p>
      <p><i>Mundo Deportivo</i> has now claimed that Neymar has visited Barcelona twice in the past six weeks – with a first visit due to his court case against his former club, while the second took place last weekend, for Luis Suarez's wife's birthday celebrations.</p>
      <p>The world's most expensive player is said to still be close with Suarez and Messi in particular, and used the opportunity to tell them that he still wants to return to the Camp Nou.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether or not Barca will again try to convince PSG of a sale when the next transfer window comes around, but Neymar's injury record might also stifle the Catalan giants' interest in their former player.</p>
