      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): <a href="http://theedgemarkets.com/">theedgemarkets.com</a> highlighted 5 stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. All stocks had negative momentum.</p>
      <p>Stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>JHM Consolidation Bhd - up three sen to RM1.40</p>
      <p>Mclean Technologies Bhd - up 0.5 sen to 19 sen</p>
      <p>Tanco Holdings Bhd - unchanged at 7.5 sen</p>
      <p>Malayan Flour Mills Bhd - unchanged at 72 sen</p>
      <p>RCE Capital Bhd - up eight sen to RM1.70</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
