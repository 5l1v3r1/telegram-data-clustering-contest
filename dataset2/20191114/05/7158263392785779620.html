      <p>The holidays are here! Cue the never-ending cheese platters, a solid excuse to practically live in sequins, and that satisfying feeling of a social cal booked with plans you actually don’t want to cancel.</p>
      <p>And not to be a bummer, but also cue dry, flaky skin. It’s nearly inevitable in the winter, but you can have glowy skin in time for holiday party number one (and your dewiest complexion yet by the ball drop) if you stock up on these hydration-boosting essentials.</p>
      <h3>1 Treat Extra-Dry Skin Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream Extra-Dry Skin</h3>

      <p>You may think of gel creams as a warm-weather staple, but think again: Loaded with hyaluronic acid, this formula was <i>specifically</i> made for extra-dry skin. It is insanely hydrating and will be totally addicting once you see how dewy it makes your skin look.</p>
      <h3>2 Cleanse, Don’t Strip Farmacy Very Cherry Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm</h3>

      <p>You know that feeling post-cleanse when your skin is almost too squeaky clean? Let’s hope not, because that means you probably just stripped your skin of all its natural oils (a huge no-no).</p>
      <p>This new cleansing balm will do just the opposite: Sunflower and moringa-seed oils gently remove makeup, while papaya extract exfoliates for a glow-up worthy of the holidays.</p>
      <h3>3 Stay Crazy-Hydrated Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum</h3>

      <p>This serum deserves a coveted spot on your vanity. It’s packed with hyaluronic acid (HA), a compound that holds 1,000 times its weight in water, to help parched skin get (and stay) hydrated. Think moisture means acne? Nope, it’s noncomedogenic, which means it won’t clog your pores.</p>

      <p>This dreamy night cream is both lightweight and effective thanks to super lotus, a moisturizing antioxidant, and peach-leaf extract, which helps stressed-out skin recover—and hydrate—while you catch some much-needed shut-eye.</p>

      <p>If you’re dealing with sensitive skin that just won’t cooperate—the stinging is real—try misting on this face spray daily. Not only will it strengthen your skin’s natural barrier, but it’ll also hydrate in the process.</p>

      <p>There’s nothing quite like an avocado mask to remind you of your low-key obsession with the toast topper. Leave the creamy mask (which smells amazing, btw) on for 15 minutes, then prepare yourself for next-level dewiness.</p>

      <p>These coconut oil makeup-removing wipes are another (more portable) way to cleanse your skin while still keeping those precious natural oils intact. Pop them in your bag to wash up wherever you are.</p>
      <h3>8 Don’t Forget Your Under Eyes Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Gel-Cream Eye</h3>

      <p>amazon.com $11.99 <a href="http://bit.ly/2WedH0T">SHOP NOW</a></p>
      <p>Fun fact: Your under eyes are extra prone to dryness, so treat them with the attention they deserve. This cream is seriously effective, making the area around the eyes look supple and smooth, but still gentle enough to be slathered onto this sensitive part of your face.</p>
