        <b>After the likes of Glenn Maxwell and Nic Maddinson, Will Pucovski has also pulled out of Test team selection on the grounds of mental health. The 21-year-old Victorian was competing for a place in the Australian middle order with possibly Travis Head who had an underwhelming Ashes with the bat.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Victoria batsman Will Pucovski opted out of being in contention for Australia's Test squad for the series against Pakistan as he wanted to focus on his mental health. He told about the matter to the team management in Perth and was granted a leave after the three-day game against Pakistan. <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/travis_head">Travis Head</a> had a poor Ashes series and Pocovski looked set to replace him in the squad but he has requested some time off from the game and it has been positively received by Cricket Australia.</p>
      <p>"We applaud Will for having the courage to discuss his situation with team management in Perth," Ben Oliver, Cricket Australia's EGM of National Teams told Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>"Mental health is a complex issue that unfortunately impacts many young men and women in our society. By Will bravely taking this position, he will undoubtedly inspire others facing similar challenges to speak up and take positive steps towards improving their mental wellbeing. The most important thing now is for Will to be given the time, space and expert support that he needs to return to full health as soon as possible," Oliver further added.</p>
      <p>Alex Kountouris, Cricket Australia's Sports Science and Sports Medicine Manager, also praised Pucovski for the courage he showed to be vocal about his issue and believed that the board will fully support him in getting over this challenge.</p>
      <p>"Will has demonstrated great strength in being open about his situation. While no one wants to see a fine young man like Will confronting mental wellbeing issues, we are heartened by the fact he is surrounded by excellent people who will support him. We are all right behind him," he said.</p>
