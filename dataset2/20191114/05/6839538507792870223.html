      <p>An Instagram-famous mummy blogger has been praised online after admitting to smoking weed daily, claiming it makes her a “better mum” and should be “just as acceptable as a glass of wine”.</p>
      <p>In a post to her more than 288,000 Instagram followers, Canadian blogger Caitlin Fladager - known for her “mum truth” confessions online - claimed smoking marijuana has helped her, especially in caring for her two children Adriana (six) and Jack (four).</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old confessed to smoking weed daily while her children slept, saying it aids her anxiety, allowed her to stop taking antidepressants and has assisted in curbing her dangerous under-eating and alcohol consumption.</p>

      <p>“Marijuana is my glass of wine,” the mother-of-two said in the post.</p>
      <p>“It’s so funny to me how frowned upon marijuana is.</p>
      <p>“No one looks twice when a mum says she enjoys ‘mum juice’, aka wine, after her kids are in bed.</p>
      <p>“But when a mum says she smokes weed, it’s a huge shock.”</p>
      <p>The post, claiming to “bring awareness” to the the stigma around 420-friendly mums, has drawn massive support online, with more than 25,000 people “liking” it in 48 hours.</p>

      <p>“Yes finally someone said it,” a mother-of-three commented on the post.</p>
      <p>Another mum agreed with Fladager’s comments about the drug being frowned upon as opposed to drinking.</p>
      <p>“It’s crazy how something that’s safer with less negative side effects than alcohol can be so looked down on,” she said.</p>
      <p>One mum from Australia said she “felt this in her soul” as marijuana is frowned up for its illegality.</p>
      <p>“I wish people would see the benefits rather than just swearing it’s bad because it’s what they’ve been told,” she wrote.</p>
