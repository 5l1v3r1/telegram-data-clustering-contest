      <p>The joint Waitrose and John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 is finally here - and it's a treat for those seeking a return to the heart-warming ads of old.</p>
      <p>This year's visual delight sees Edgar the excitable green dragon teaming up with his best friend Ava in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>The animated dragon can't contain his excitement for Christmas, resulting in total disaster every time he's introduced to the other people living in their historical village.</p>
      <p>As Edgar and Ava join a group of children to build a snowman, Edgar attempts to stick a carrot on his chilly pal - but instead lets slip a puff of flame, instantly melting the kids' creation.</p>

      <p>Unimpressed, the children stand with the arms crossed, looking annoyed at Edgar.</p>
      <p>The next scene sees the villagers enjoying their ice-rink, skating round merrily under the crisp winter sky.</p>
      <p>But once again, Edgar's excitement leads to destruction when he accidentally lights up the rink, sending the villagers into freezing slush.</p>
      <p>Edgar's third chance of behaving himself comes when the whole community gathers in the village square to admire the lavishly decorated Christmas tree and the pretty lights.</p>

      <p>But the dragon can't control himself, despite Ava wrapping a scarf around his snout, and manages to set the tree on fire, burning up all the Christmas decorations.</p>
      <p>Close to tears, Edgar flees from the village, locking himself up at home so he can't bother anyone else.</p>
      <p>It looks like that Edgar is going to give Christmas a miss despite it seemingly being his favourite time of the year.</p>
      <p>However, Ava is determined to give Edgar the Christmas he's so desperate to enjoy, and knocks on his door bearing a wrapped gift - although her friend is too ashamed to see her.</p>

      <p>The last scene of the advert shows the villagers getting together for their annual Christmas feast, with tables groaning under the weight of all their food.</p>
      <p>Ava blows a bugle to announce the arrival of their guest of honour - but as Edgar walks in, everyone dives for cover.</p>
      <p>Is this the moment that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">Christmas dinner</a> is going to become deep and crisp and even with another blast from Edgar's fiery nostrils?</p>
      <p>It's not until the dragon unveils the present Ava has given him that they breathe a sigh of relief: a perfectly shaped Christmas pudding gleams in his paws.</p>

      <p>As the villagers relax, Edgar gently sets the dessert alight with a tiny puff of flame - and Christmas is saved.</p>
      <p>The advert finishes with the message: "Show them how much you care."</p>
      <p>The festive season has once again spread some Christmas cheer and Edgar has finally got the day he was hoping for.</p>

      <p>The advert was made in partnership with ad agency adam&amp;eveDDB, which was behind the first John Lewis tear-jerker, the story of the little boy who couldn't wait for Christmas in 2011.</p>
      <p>It cost an estimated £8million and was filmed over two weeks in Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Loving little Ava is played by 10-year-old schoolgirl Ruby Dailly, who comes from Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Ruby was chosen from thousands of youngsters for the role.</p>
      <p>She said: "Ava keeps on being friends with the dragon, even though he sets everything on fire.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't mean to so he gets sad whenever I’m mad at him."</p>

      <p>Richard Brim, the London agency's chief creative officer, said experts whittled around 400 scripts down to a shortlist of 30 before choosing Edgar as this year's star turn.</p>
      <p>He added: "There was something we really liked about him. Edgar loves Christmas - like just loves Christmas. Every time he sees something Christmasy, he can't control his fire.</p>
      <p>"But obviously this can be quite detrimental to the Christmas period."</p>
      <p>Dan Smith, lead singer of alt-pop band, Bastille said; “It’s so great to be asked to be part of this year’s John Lewis Christmas ad.</p>
      <p>"As a band we’ve always had a lot of fun putting a twist on classic songs, and it’s been so good to be a part of this orchestral version of an eighties classic.</p>
      <p>"We’re hoping we get an Edgar for Christmas too!”</p>

      <p>With Edgar fever expected to sweep Britain, fans can give themselves the dragon look on Snapchat by turning into Edgar fire breathers with smoke coming out of their ears.</p>
      <p>Craig Inglis, customer director at John Lewis &amp; Partners, said of Edgar: "It started from a spark of an idea - a little dragon's excitement about Christmas - and became the story of how someone goes the extra mile for their best friend to give just the right gift.</p>
      <p>"It's a funny, heart-warming story that will resonate with our customers as they seek out the perfect gifts for their loved ones this Christmas."</p>
      <p>People are loving the advert.</p>
      <p>One said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: "It's the first #johnlewischristmasadvert to make me cry since the bear and the hare, brilliant message that everyone has something to bring to the table"</p>
      <p>"I want my own Edgar," another posted.</p>
