      <h1>George Lucas Has Apparently Changed the Famous Greedo Scene In 1977's Star Wars Again, For Disney+</h1>

      <p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/~Freshly+Exhumed">Freshly Exhumed</a> shares a report from The Guardian: <i>George Lucas, whose departure from all things Star Wars seems to have been greatly exaggerated -- <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/13/macclunkey-george-lucas-star-wars-disney-plus-greedo">appears to have yet again doctored the famous Greedo scene in 1977's Star Wars</a> [prior to it being shown on the Disney+ streaming service]. The scene depicts the Mos Eisley cantina in which Harrison Ford's Han Solo is confronted by an alien bounty hunter and winds up shooting him dead in a brief flurry of blaster fire. It has been much discussed over the years, largely because Solo shot Greedo in cold blood in the original, "Han shot first" 1977 cut, while in later versions Lucas re-edited the footage to depict Greedo as the aggressor, with Han returning fire in self-defense. Many fans have speculated about what effect that subtle change had on Han's transformation in the original trilogy from cold-hearted hustler to hero of the resistance. Now Lucas has tinkered all over again, to further muddy the waters. <br/><br/>As seen on new streaming service Disney+, the scene features Han and Greedo shooting at roughly the same moment -- to be fair, this is a change introduced several years back. But now, Greedo appears to utter the phrase "MacClunkey!" before succumbing to his wounds. Reports suggest Lucas made the changes some years ago, perhaps around the time he <a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/12/10/30/2018219/disney-to-acquire-lucasfilm-star-wars-episode-7-due-in-2015">sold Lucasfilm to Disney for $4 billion</a>, in 2012. Celebrities such as <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1194299858842243073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194299858842243073&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.menshealth.com%2Fentertainment%2Fa29776716%2Fmaclunkey-greedo-han-solo-star-wars-disney-plus%2F">Stephen King</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt/status/1194294174268325891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194294174268325891&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2F2019%2Fnov%2F13%2Fmacclunkey-george-lucas-star-wars-disney-plus-greedo">Patton Oswalt</a> have speculated about what the re-edit means for the future of Star Wars, though nobody seems to have much of a clue.</i></p>
