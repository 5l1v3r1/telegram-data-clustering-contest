      <p>Microsoft has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-games-2020-plans/">added more than 50 new games</a> to the preview of its Project xCloud game streaming service, including Devil May Cry 5, Tekken 7 and Madden 2020. Engadget reports: <i>In a blog post today, Microsoft said it'll send out a new wave of xCloud preview invites to gamers in the US, UK and South Korea. Starting next year, it also plans to expand the preview to Canada, India, Japan and Western Europe. If you live in one of those countries, you can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-streaming/project-xcloud/register?irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2000142_aff_7593_10078&amp;tduid=(ir__r2w6mnc3jokftwbdkk0sohziz32xgofrx1xetzyl00)(7593)(10078)(engadget.com)(72705X1521812Xaa443bdd321c0f0b57549052be1655e1)&amp;irclickid=_r2w6mnc3jokftwbdkk0sohziz32xgofrx1xetzyl00">sign up for the preview</a> here and hope you get selected. <br/><br/>For now, the xCloud preview is only available for Android phones and tablets, but Microsoft says next year it'll also be headed to Windows PCs and other devices. I'm sure Roku owners would be pleased, but it'd be even more intriguing if Microsoft could eventually bring the xCloud preview to smart TVs and Apple devices. While testers need to use Xbox controllers with the service now, Microsoft also says it'll work with other bluetooth controllers next year, including Sony's Dual Shock 4 and Razer's entries. Yes, you'll soon live in a world where you can play Halo with a PlayStation branded gamepad. Among other tidbits, the xCloud preview will also let gamers stream titles they already own next year, as well those made available through Xbox GamePass for subscribers.</i></p>
