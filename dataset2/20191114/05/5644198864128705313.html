      <p>Chicago's mayor on Wednesday rejected an alternative proposal by Uber Technologies Inc to tax ride-hailing services, accusing the company of trying to resist any type of regulation by stirring up racial tensions.</p>
      <p>CHICAGO/NEW YORK: Chicago's mayor on Wednesday rejected an alternative proposal by Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc to tax ride-hailing services, accusing Uber of trying to resist any type of regulation by stirring up racial tensions.</p>
      <p>Mayor Lori Lightfoot last month proposed raising US$40 million from a traffic congestion tax on certain ride-hailing trips, a move Uber and Lyft said would largely hurt low-income residents in Chicago's predominantly black neighbourhoods.</p>

      <p>This latest battle comes as more U.S. cities pursue taxes to combat what they describe as increasingly clogged streets due to ride-sharing vehicles.</p>
      <p>At a press conference, Lightfoot, the city's first female African-American mayor, took aim at Uber's tactics, which she said included offering money to black clergy in the city to oppose the plan.</p>
      <p>"They keep throwing up all kinds of things against the wall claiming that somehow this mayor is going to be against black and brown communities," she said.</p>
      <p>Uber in a statement rejected the mayor's claims, saying its alternative plan would raise more money for the cash-strapped city in a more equitable way by not increasing fees on lower-income communities in Chicago's South and West sides.</p>
      <p>The company also said it never proposed personal payments to community members.</p>
      <p>Lyft backed Uber's position, adding in a statement that it looks forward to working with the mayor and the city council, which is expected to vote on Lightfoot's proposal later this month.</p>
      <p>Under the mayor's plan, taxes on single-rider trips would increase to US$1.13 from the current 60 cents, while those for shared trips would drop by 7 cents to 53 cents. There would also be a new US$1.75 surcharge on weekday rides beginning or ending in a designated downtown area.</p>
      <p>The tax is a response to the city's "skyrocketing congestion," partially caused by the rapid growth of ride-hailing, Lightfoot said last month. The additional revenue is also part of her plan to address a big deficit in the city's upcoming budget.</p>
