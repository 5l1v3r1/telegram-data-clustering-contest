      <h1>Brooklyn Beckham dating Marvel star Nicola Peltz - the fourth woman in four months</h1>
      <h2>Brooklyn Beckham is not hanging about when it comes to finding a new beau as he has been linked with his fourth woman in as many months as he looks for 'the one'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:58:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:58</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Brooklyn Beckham is playing the field just like his father David would command a football pitch, as he goes official with his fourth woman in as many months.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has found himself jumping from relationship to relationship but it seems that he may have found a keeper this time.</p>
      <p>The son of former England football captain David and Spice Girl turned fashion designer, Victoria, has gone 'official' with 24-year-old Marvel actress Nicola Peltz.</p>
      <p>For her part, Nicola has been busy leaving comments on Brooklyn's recent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> posts, adding an angel emoji to a couple snaps.</p>
      <p>The pair are looking smitten with each other in a photo that was posted in social media and it has been reported that Brooklyn is already getting on well with her family.</p>

      <p>A source told The Sun: “Brooklyn has already met her family and he gets on well with her brother, they even partied together.”</p>
      <p>Brooklyn will be hoping that his parents will be more approving of Nicola after they were concerned about his recent dates.</p>
      <p>It was reported that they were less than happy with his 'secret fling' with Kate Moss' half-sister Lottie and they were worried that he was gaining a reputation for being a 'ladykiller'.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn split from model Hana Cross in the summer and Nicola is the fourth woman that he has been linked with since that time.</p>
      <p>The wannabe photographer has also been dating actresses Natalie Ganzhorn and Phoebe Torrance.</p>
      <p>The latter is the 27-year-old daughter of golfing legend Sam, and the strange twist in that relationship was that Phoebe used to work as a lookalike of his mum, Victoria.</p>

      <p>Brooklyn is still looking to make his name as a photographer and was given a boost when he landed the opportunity to take part in a photoshoot for America's Next Top Model with Heidi Klum.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly not as comfortable with the chance to snap a supermodel but will hope the experience will hold him in good stead for the future.</p>
