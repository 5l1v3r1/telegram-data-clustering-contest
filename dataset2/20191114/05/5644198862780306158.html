      <p>NEW YORK: The Dow and S&amp;P 500 floated higher on Wednesday (Nov 13), inching to fresh records despite multiplying reports that US and Chinese trade officials are still struggling to conclude a partial bargain.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell largely met investor expectations for the first of two days of congressional testimony.</p>

      <p>House lawmakers also opened the first day of televised impeachment hearings during which the top US diplomat in Ukraine levelled fresh accusations about President Donald Trump's conduct that country.</p>

      <p>The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 92.10 points (0.33 per cent) to finish the session at 27,783.59, lifted by soaring Disney shares.</p>
      <p>The Walt Disney Co shot more than seven per cent higher, its biggest one-day gain since April, after reporting that its streaming service Disney+ had attracted 10 million subscribers on its first day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 scraped by with a positive close, finishing essentially flat at 3,094.04. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 3.99 points (0.05 per cent) to 8,482.10.</p>
      <p>Markets quickly pared gains in mid-afternoon following a new report by The Wall Street Journal saying Chinese officials hesitated to agree formally to making gigantic purchases of American farm exports.</p>
      <p>Trump last month announced a "phase one" deal had been agreed but efforts to commit the deal to paper appear to have hit roadblocks.</p>
      <p>The two sides have already differed publicly on whether and when to remove tariffs imposed in their year-and-a-half-old trade war.</p>
      <p>In a briefing on Wednesday after markets closed, Trump said "our trade agreement with China is moving along very rapidly."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in his testimony, Powell reaffirmed that the central bank is on hold after cutting the benchmark lending rate three times this year.</p>
      <p>"He did not deliver anything new but he delivered his message clearly: no need for more easing but they would ease if they needed to," Karl Haeling of LBBW told AFP.</p>
