      <h1>‘Cache of diamonds’: Trump-Biden impeachment fight originates with corrupt chauffeur</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:01:22+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author">Joel Gehrke</a></address>
      <p>Sixty-five diamonds and a shady chauffeur underpin the investigation that doomed former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin and grew into an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/mcconnell-senate-has-no-choice-but-to-take-up-impeachment">impeachment investigation</a> targeting President Trump.</p>
      <p>Shokin earned the enmity of the United States government through his loyalty to a chauffeur who was caught with a "cache of diamonds" after Shokin gave him a job as a local prosecutor, a key impeachment witness told lawmakers. The ex-driver, Oleksandr Korniyets, abused his position <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/source-says-poroshenko-interferes-with-investigations-412051.html">to force wealthy businessmen</a> to give him money in order to avoid criminal charges, George Kent, one of the State Department’s top officials for Europe, testified. Korniyets' misdeeds came to light after reformist investigators raided his apartment and found dozens of diamonds, along with cash and other valuables. But despite public uproar, Kent said, Shokin tried to shield him.</p>
      <p>“Shokin went to war,” Kent told lawmakers during his Oct. 15 <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/CPRT-116-IG00-D009.pdf">deposition</a>. “It was absolute warfare protecting his associate, and he destroyed the inspector general unit that we'd been standing up.”</p>
      <p>Kent’s testimony gives the context for Joe Biden’s demand that Ukrainian leaders fire Shokin following the “diamond prosecutor” scandal, as the case came to be known. The controversy put Shokin on the wrong side of the first investigation launched by the watchdog who had partnered with U.S. officials to reform the prosecutor’s office.</p>
      <p>“The first case turned out to have been the former driver of Shokin, who — he made his driver a prosecutor,” said Kent, the deputy chief of mission in Ukraine from 2016 to 2018.</p>
      <p>Korniyets, the chauffeur-turned-prosecutor, was implicated in the summer of 2015, when a Ukrainian businessman told the new inspector general that he was “being shaken down” by Shokin’s cronies, Kent explained. This complaint turned into a “test case” for the reform efforts, as the inspector general launched an investigation of Korniyets' activities.</p>
      <p>“One of the things they confiscated from his former driver was a cache of diamonds,” Kent said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://censor.net.ua/en/photo_news/342767/about_500000_and_valuables_seized_from_the_detained_prosecutors_office_officials_photos">The 65 diamonds</a> in Korniyets' apartment had been seized from a jewelry factory in a previous shakedown, according to the factory owner. The aggrieved businessman complained that Korniyets had opened a case against him that “would be closed in exchange for 'forgetting' the money and gold stolen during the search,” according to Deputy Prosecutor General David Sakvarelidze, <a href="http://georgiatoday.ge/news/3419/Georgian-born-Sakvarelidze-Sacked-by-Ukraine%E2%80%99s-Disgraced-Prosecutor-General">who was ousted by Shokin</a> after he called for his boss’s resignation. The jewelry factory owner <a href="https://www.unian.info/kiev/10469457-man-shot-dead-in-kyiv-identified-as-key-witness-in-diamond-prosecutors-case.html">was shot dead </a>in his car in Kyiv in March.</p>
      <p>Korniyets was released on bail, while Shokin retaliated against the officials involved in the case. “He wanted to destroy anybody connected with that effort,” Kent testified. “He eventually managed to force out everybody associated with that, including the deputy head of the security service, the intel service, who had provided the wiretapping coverage.”</p>
      <p>Shokin’s aggressive defense of his ex-driver was evidence for U.S. officials and reform-minded Ukrainians that he was a profiteer. As a result, Geoffrey Pyatt, then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, asked Biden to demand that then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fire Shokin.</p>
      <p>Poroshenko's reluctance hurt U.S. interests because the U.S. was <a href="https://2012-2017.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-18-2015-us-signs-loan-guarantee-agreement-ukraine">using loan guarantees</a> to encourage Western banks to invest in Ukraine, putting American taxpayers on the hook if Shokin or other prosecutors stole the money.</p>
      <p>“Shokin's removal then became a condition for the loan guarantee,” Kent testified. “To the best of my knowledge, the idea came from Ambassador Pyatt ... and then was pitched to the Office of the Vice President.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/conned-road-to-trump-impeachment-may-have-begun-with-giuliani-getting-played-by-ukrainian-prosecutor">Rudy Giuliani seized</a> on Biden’s role in Shokin’s ouster <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-traveling-to-ukraine-seeking-to-damage-biden-bolster-trump">to accuse</a> the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate of corruption. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-says-biden-is-trying-to-silence-him-because-he-fears-what-he-has-to-say">Giuliani argued</a> that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/it-could-blow-up-in-their-face-2020-democrats-tiptoe-around-the-joe-biden-ukraine-furor">Biden targeted Shokin</a> at a time when the prosecutor general was investigating an oligarch who owned a company that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-bidens-son-gets-job-with-major-ukrainian-natural-gas-company">hired Hunter Biden,</a> the vice president’s son.</p>
      <p>But Shokin did not <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/volker-trumps-accusation-against-joe-biden-has-no-credibility">not investigate</a> the oligarch.</p>
      <p>Kent, while explaining the State Department “spent roughly half a million dollars” building the case against the oligarch, told lawmakers that he confronted another of Shokin’s deputies personally over the case.</p>
      <p>“We spent months and hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to help your country get your stolen assets back, and somebody in your office took a bribe and shut a case, and we're angry,” Kent recalled telling the Ukrainian official.</p>
