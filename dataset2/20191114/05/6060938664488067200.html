      <p>DUBAI: Indian para athlete <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nishad-Kumar">Nishad Kumar</a> recorded a personal best of 2 metres to claim the bronze medal in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/men's-high-jump-T47">men's high jump T47</a> final at the Dubai <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Para-Athletics-Championships">World Para Athletics Championships</a> and also secure his place in the 2020 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-Paralympic-Games">Tokyo Paralympic Games</a>.</p>
      <p>Nishad's medal booked India's ninth slot for the Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>This was India's third bronze and six medals overall, one better than 2017 London Worlds. India had won five medals in the 2017 edition.</p>
      <p>Nishad led the pack from the start clearing the bar first at 1.75 to 1.97 men's high jump before China's Hongjie Chen pushed him with a 2 metres jump.</p>

      <p>But the USA's Rio Paralympic champion and world record holder Roderick Townsend-Roberts cleared the bar just once at 2.03 metres to take the gold. Chen settled for silver.</p>
      <p>"I am super happy. It's my first World Championships, never expected that I will get a medal competing against such top players. My next target is Tokyo 2020 Paralympics," Nishad told Paralympic Committee of India.</p>
      <p>"I had nothing to lose so gave my best today. I believe in hard work. I will go back home and work hard for Tokyo 2020," said Nishad, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall and is competing in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Para-Athletics">Para Athletics</a> for the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>India coach Satyanarayana, who trained Mariyappan Thangavelu to Rio 2016 gold, said Nishad has a lot of potential and will be one of the strong prospects for India at Tokyo 2020.</p>
      <p>"The best thing about Nishad is that he is young and flexible. His capacity is 2.30 metres. I am sure if he works hard on his technique, he will get a medal at the Paralympics."</p>
      <p>On Thursday, six of Indian athletes including Mariyappan and Sharad Kumar will be in action in Men's high jump T63 and men's 400m events.</p>
