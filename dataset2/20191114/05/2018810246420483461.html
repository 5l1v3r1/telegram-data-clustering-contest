      <p>Noted vocalist Toad has finally released his long-awaited version of “Shallow,” the Oscar-winning duet from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, and it is truly the height of vocal performance. If you’ve already written a piece about the top songs of the decade, talk about bad timing!</p>

      <p>Toad’s musical range is unparalleled. You may remember his breathtaking rendition of Sia’s “Chandelier” from last year.</p>
