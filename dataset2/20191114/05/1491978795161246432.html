        <i>Myles was feeling the fantasy in a scarlet dress, stilettos and a blonde coiffure: ‘I’ve been called Ruby Giuliani. It’s a little offensive’</i>

      <p>Forget quid pro quo, when there’s a drag queen in town you’ll get quip pro quo. And there was no doubt in Washington on Wednesday – there was a drag queen in town.<br/><br/>Performer Pissi Myles, of New Jersey, sashayed into the congressional building where the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/trump-impeachment-inquiry-public-hearings-democrats-republicans">first</a> public <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> hearings in the Trump-Ukraine scandal were taking place.</p>
      <p>In her scarlet dress and stilettos, flawless blond hair to the heavens, Myles cut a fierce figure on Capitol Hill. She was there to cover the hearing for <a href="https://happs.tv/about">Happs</a>, a live news startup, and could be seen broadcasting live from a pink smartphone.</p>
      <p>Getting through security was touch and go, but Myles made it to the heart of the action, alongside the hundreds favoring somber suits and conservative coiffure.</p>
      <p>“Tensions are high, and the bar for who’s allowed in the Longworth House is very, very low,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/drag-queen-sashays-trump-impeachment-hearings-n1081261">she told NBC</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/drag-queen-sashays-trump-impeachment-hearings-n1081261"> News</a>.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/HappsNews/status/1194783595178512386">a broadcast posted to Twitter</a> she described the effect she’d had: “It’s pretty crazy. I’m apparently being referred to as the lady in red, I’ve been called Ruby Giuliani. It’s a little offensive to me that they would assume I took a side in this conversation.”</p>
      <p>Of the significance of the day’s testimony, she said: “We’ve heard people saying it was all about quid-pro-quo but today we actually got to hear the testimony and hear what the actual elements of that were … Everyone is so divided. It’s really the most polarizing political activity I’ve seen in a very long time.”</p>
      <p>Myles performs in New York and across the north-east. Her online <a href="http://pissimyles.com/about/">bio</a> states that: “Pissi Myles was born kicking and screaming and hasn’t stopped since.”</p>
      <p>It adds that she has been a winner of the Philly Drag Wars and Miss Fish NYC contests and performs regularly at the Pines on Fire Island, a popular beach town destination for LGBTQ New Yorkers in summer.</p>

      <p>She also told NBC News that “It’s a crazy day in Washington!” Funny, that’s just what the acting ambassador to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/23/trump-bill-taylor-testimony-republicans-impeachment-inquiry">Bill Taylor, said</a> (more or less) when he heard that the Trump administration was holding up military aid to the country in order to pressure it to investigate Donald Trump’s American political rivals.</p>
      <p>The Illinois Democratic representative Jan Schakowsky, who happened to be a sartorial congressional standout in her brilliant red suit when she bumped into Myles, quickly tucked herself under the towering and ecstatic queen’s wing and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/janschakowsky/photos/a.215870837118/10158733976607119/?type=3&amp;theater">shared</a> the resulting picture on Facebook.</p>
      <p>“So glad Pissi Myles and I were matching!” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Whether the hearing matched up to expectations is a whole other question. It was certainly a Pissi contest and the only sure winner was Myles.</p>
