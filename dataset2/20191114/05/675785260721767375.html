      <h1>Victor Lindelof explains Man Utd's 'problem' against lesser clubs</h1>
      <h2>Centre-half says Manchester United have been too 'comfortable' in games against so-called lesser teams - resulting in some shock defeats</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:26:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:26</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Victor Lindelof says Manchester United have struggled because of complacency this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> are currently seventh in the Premier League after an underwhelming start to the season.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side appeared to have turned a corner in their most recent outing - a 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> which the manager described as the Red Devils' best performance of the season.</p>
      <p>United are also the only team to have taken a point against Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> this term, and have beaten second-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City and third-placed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>However, they have also suffered shock defeats to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and most recently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> .</p>

      <p>And centre-half Lindelof says they must treat every match as a big game if they are to rediscover the winning mentality that marked out the great United teams of the past.</p>
      <p>"I generally think there is one thing we need to get better at if we are going to get back to the level <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> should be at: that’s winning matches week in and week out," the Swedish defender told Aftonbladet.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes it does not have to be neat, but you should win anyway.</p>
      <p>"There’s been a bit of a problem - If we go into the matches against big clubs, we’re all connected, and we get results.</p>
      <p>"Then a few days go by and we meet a slightly lower team, then we have to go in exactly the same way, not get comfortable.</p>
      <p>"We start well, play fast and get to positions – but then we stop with it after 20 minutes, complicate it and play poorly."</p>
      <p>Lindelof will hope his team-mates heed his words when they return to action after the international break with a Premier League clash away to fifth-placed Sheffield United.</p>
