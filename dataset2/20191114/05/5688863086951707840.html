        <b>India's white-ball regular opener Shikhar Dhawan is keen on making a return to Test cricket and is working hard on it. Dhawan had last played a Test against England in 2018 and was then dropped due to poor form but is determined to make a comeback with good performances in the Ranji Trophy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shikhar Dhawan had scored a fantastic Test hundred on his debut in 2013 in Mohali against Australia which is the fastest Test hundred on debut. But the graph of his Test form has fallen exponentially over the years, especially in testing overseas conditions he has often been found out with technical flaws and thus was dropped from the team in 2018 in the middle of India's tour to England.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> making a fantastic start to his Test career as an opener and with the likes of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mayank_agarwal">Mayank Agarwal</a> and Shubman Gill ahead in the pecking order, it is difficult for Dhawan to get back in the Test reckoning. But he has not lost hope and will continue to work hard and will try to make a Test comeback. </p>
      <p>I love playing cricket and I always make sure to focus on my process and make it very strong. I was playing T20. I will play <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/ranji_trophy">Ranji Trophy</a> too and look to perform and be a strong contender to get back to the Indian team. I am as young as I was when I was playing Ranji. I have the same energy and determination. I am very happy," Dhawan told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>Dhawan is not looking too much into the future and is just going step-by-step and trying to contribute as much as he can for the team.</p>
      <p>“I am just enjoying my cricket and just want to go step by step. I want to make the best of the chances that I get,” he asserted.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old had a mixed bag of a T20 series against South Africa and Bangladesh as he could not give the quick start in the powerplay overs that India need. With the T20 World Cup round the corner, question marks have been raised on Dhawan's spot in the side, especially with capable and explosive batsmen like <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kl_rahul">KL Rahul</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sanju_samson">Sanju Samson</a> who have performed well in domestic cricket, waiting in the wings. But Dhawan is still trying to be positive and he is looking to improve with every game that he plays.</p>
      <p>"The series went decent for me. I played well and aggressively. Just in the last T-20 in Delhi, I played defensively as the pitch was different. I felt I could have been more aggressive. A 50 would have been better than the 41 I made. It was a learning point. It's going good for me and it will get better," he concluded.</p>
