      <h1>Ferrari Roma front engined V8 coupe unveiled</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:56:29+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:56</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Ferrari has unveiled its fifth new car for 2019, the Ferrari Roma. The Roma is a front-engined, rear-wheel-drive V8 coupe and competes with the likes of the Aston Martin Vantage, the Mercedes-AMG GT-R and more powerful versions of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/porsche/911-m133/">Porsche 911</a>.</p>

      <p>Although Ferrari hasn't confirmed this, <a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/2018-ferrari-portofino-first-drive-review/">the Roma seems to be based on the same basic structure as the Portofino convertible</a>. It has the same wheelbase as the Portofino, 2,670mm, but is just shy of its length (4,656mm) and width (1,974mm). It is also 80 kgs lighter than the Portofino at 1,472kg. Unlike its mid-engined models or even the larger front-engined cars, this Ferrari seems to have a more sedate look to it. There are soft, flowing lines, clean bodywork and quite a few elements from older Ferrari models like the teardrop silhouette and muscular haunches. The inward-facing front face and the sharp rake to the boot, with the split taillamps, are other unique touches.</p>

      <p>The interiors are also a departure from recent Ferraris. The digital instrument cluster, with the button-heavy steering wheel, remains. But the central tunnel is now placed much higher, flowing in from a high-set dashboard. There is a new infotainment screen in the middle and a separate screen for the passenger. There seem to be more capacitive touch buttons and a new gear selector. Ferrari calls Roma a 2+ coupe, so we expect tiny seats at the back.</p>

      <p>The Roma uses another iteration of the brand's 3.9-litre twin-turbo V8. Here it is mounted in the font-mid configuration and makes 620PS and 760 Nm. The claimed 0 to 100 kmph time is of 3.4s, while the 200kmph mark comes up in 9.3s. Top speed is on the better side of 320 kmph. This is paired with the eight-speed DCT t<a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/heres-the-2019-ferrari-sf90-stradale-hybrid-hypercar/">hat debuted on the SF90 Stradale</a>, mounted on the rear axle</p>
