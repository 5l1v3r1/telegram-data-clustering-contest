      <p>“On top of that, (US President Donald) Trump’s no update on the US-China trade war has prolonged cautious sentiment among investors,” a dealer said.</p>
      <p>However, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, yesterday, gave a positive indication that the US economy is recovering, hence, sees interest rates change unlikely.</p>
      <p>Back home, he said investors patiently await Bank Negara’s third quarter (Q3) results, scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The Standard Chartered Global Research estimated Malaysia’s Q3 gross domestic product’s (GDP) growth to ease to 4.4 per cent from 6.2 per cent in the same quarter last year due to a high base effect.</p>
