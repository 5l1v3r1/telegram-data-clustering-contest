      <p>Yes, that is the real title. With <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a> came hundreds of classics, readily available to be streamed from the convenience of your couch—no VHS player necessary, as well as all-new TV shows and movies from the new streaming service. And one of those brand-new shows is a <a href="http://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/high-school-musical-bundle">spin-off</a> of the Oscar-worthy <i>High School Musical</i>.</p>

      <p>The Disney Channel Original Movie that brought us not only Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens but ALSO “The Start of Something New,” “Bop to the Top” AND “Get’cha Head in the Game” has been revived for the next generation to enjoy. It’s a rite of passage at this point.</p>

      <h3>What is the new show even about?</h3>
      <p>It’s a mockumentary. (Think: <i>The Office</i> but for teens…and older millennials living out their childhoods.) The 10 episodes of season 1 take place in a world where East High is an *actual* school and the original movie was filmed there before it took off and became as big of a hit as it did IRL. AND it has actual high-school-age kids playing the high schoolers. A revolutionary concept.</p>

      <p>The students at East High are putting on their own version of <i>High School Musical</i>—and it’s somehow the first time the school has ever done it. So the new series follows the drama students as they audition and practice for the upcoming play—as well as fall in love, make new friends, get in fights, create rivalries, and, of course, sing their hearts out the only way true Wildcats know how.</p>

      <h3>Can we expect a Zac Efron cameo or nah?</h3>
      <p>Sadly, it looks like there won’t be any returning cast members from the original. BUT show creator Tim Federle told <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/high-school-musical-the-musical-the-series-disney-plus-tim-federle.html"><u>Vulture</u></a>: “If Zac Efron wants to appear in a huge pivotal role down the line, I’m happy to write that perhaps he’s making a movie about the show.” So fingers absolutely crossed.</p>

      <p>And we can def count on some of the old songs being redone, since you legally cannot do a <i>High School Musical</i> series without “The Start of Something New” being sung by someone. Which, understandable.</p>
      <p>And don’t worry—we also already know there’s going to be a season 2 (!).</p>
      <h3>Okay, how do I watch this thing?</h3>
      <p>The first episode of the show is available now on Disney+, and the streaming service will add a new episode every Friday until the 10-episode run is over. So basically, cancel all your weekend plans until after the new year.</p>
