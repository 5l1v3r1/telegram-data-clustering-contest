      <h1>Gosar fires back after Katie Hill rips his 'Epstein' tweets: You taught the country what a 'throuple' was</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T05:18:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 05:18</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-paul-gosar-jeffrey-epstein-didnt-kill-himself">Paul Gosar</a>, R-Ariz., slammed his former colleague Katie Hill after she criticized his cryptic Epstein tweets, telling her she taught the country a new word: "throuple."</p>
      <p>Hill reprimanded Gosar over a series of tweets that spelled out "Epstein didn't kill himself," a line that has been appearing in memes and on social media. Hill blasted him for "tweeting out real conspiracy theories."</p>
      <p>"No[,] like this actually happened. Real members of Congress tweeting out real conspiracy theories. In an acrostic no less," Hill tweeted.</p>
      <p>Gosar fired back, "You’re surprised by me? You single-handedly taught an entire country a new word. #throuple," Gosar reacted. "And wth is up with that tattoo? Relax."</p>
      <p>"Throuple," which is a term to describe a three-person relationship, was the arrangement Hill reportedly had with her estranged husband and a female campaign staffer. Hill accused her estranged husband of leaking the nude photos as "revenge porn" amid their messy divorce. Hill's attorneys also vehemently denied allegations made in a DailyMail story that one of the nude photos shows a “Nazi-era Iron Cross” tattoo.</p>
      <p>Gosar drew some attention to his Twitter account on Wednesday with a series of tweets he wrote in reaction to the ongoing testimony of U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent as the first witnesses in a public impeachment hearing of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, sharing videos and articles that memorialized the event.</p>
      <p>"Evidence of a link between foreign aid and political investigations simply does not exist. The longer this circus continues the clearer it becomes that @realDonaldTrump has done absolutely nothing wrong," Gosar wrote on his official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>Before that, "President @realDonaldTrump voluntarily chose to release the transcript of his phone call which clearly shows he did nothing wrong. This impeachment circus is a total sham, and Adam Schiff is the clown at the center of it all."</p>
      <p>And, before that, "Schiff’s star witness is crumbling under pressure. He wasn’t listening to the phone call and he has never even met President Trump."</p>

      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/congressman-drops-epic-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-meme-during-impeachment-hearing">Daily Wire</a> and others took notice that as readers scrolled down Gosar's profile, the first letters of each tweet spelled, "Epstein didn't kill himself."</p>

      <p>The "Epstein didn't kill himself" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeffrey-epstein-did-not-kill-himself">meme has spread like wildfire</a> after the death of convicted pedophile <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. The New York City medical examiner determined he had taken his own life, but vocal skeptics have suggested otherwise during random blurt-outs on television and other signs.</p>
      <p>In a statement to Fox News, Gosar stressed that his tweets were all "substantive" but appeared to have some more fun in the process.</p>
      <p>"All of the tweets pertained to testimony from today’s hearing.</p>
      <p>Rest assured, they are substantive.</p>
      <p>Every one of them.</p>
      <p>All of them.</p>
      <p>5 were brilliant.</p>
      <p>1 was ok.”</p>
      <p>In other words, "Area 51."</p>

      <p>Hill resigned from Congress earlier this month after she was accused of having multiple inappropriate relationships with subordinates, including a congressional staffer that prompted an investigation from the House Ethics Committee.</p>
