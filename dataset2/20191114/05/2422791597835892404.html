      <p>SASKATOON -- Police say two inmates considered to be violent have escaped from the federal Regional Psychiatric Centre in Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Investigators are warning people to call police if they see anything suspicious and to lock their homes and vehicles.</p>
      <p>The men police are looking for include Kendal Campeau, who is 29, and 24-year-old Matthew Michel.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Campeau pleaded guilty to charges for storming a guard station at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre with other inmates armed with homemade knives, taking three correctional workers hostage.</p>
      <p>The guards were not hurt.</p>
      <p>The Correctional Service of Canada says the Regional Psychiatric Centre is a mental hospital with the security provisions to also function as a federal correctional institution.</p>
