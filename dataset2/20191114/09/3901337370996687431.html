      <p>The Portuguese tactician, who has been without a job since being fired by the Red Devils in December 2018, was once again working as analyst for <i>Sky Sports </i>when he commented on the much-debated referee calls during the match between the Reds and the Citizens.</p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold twice appeared to handle the ball inside his box, but neither match official Michael Oliver nor the VAR system thought the incidents warranted spot-kicks.</p>

      <p>After Pep Guardiola had become enraged on the sidelines and his players were also visibly upset as a result, Mourinho insisted the Premier League champions should focus on their own mistakes that cost them the game.</p>
      <p>"This Manchester City team is too good to be crying for a week over an incident," he said on a post-match <i>Sky Sports </i>broadcast of the match.</p>
      <p>"They should concentrate on the game and what they could do better.</p>
      <p>"Every time I played against Liverpool, with not-so-good teams, I worried about the distances between my four defenders, with (Roberto) Firmino falling between the lines and (Mohamed) Salah and (Sadio) Mane occupying the gaps, Liverpool scored two goals like this today, and they were totally avoidable."</p>

      <p>The 3-1 defeat to Liverpool was City's third loss of the 2019/20 Premier League campaign, and saw them drop to fourth place, nine points behind the log leaders.</p>
