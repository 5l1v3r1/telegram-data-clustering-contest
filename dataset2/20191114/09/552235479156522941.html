      <h2>Harry McDonough launched the violent assault on Dean Wilson who was out celebrating his 21st birthday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:36:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Paisley Express, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paisley-daily-express/</a></address>
      <p>A burly one-punch brute left a birthday reveller with a bleed on the brain in a street attack.</p>
      <p>Harry McDonough hit Dean Wilson, 21, so hard he smashed his head off the ground, fracturing his skull and cheekbone.</p>
      <p>Surgeons had to cut the young victim’s head open to operate on a bleed on his brain following the assault in Shuttle Street, Paisley, on December 16 last year.</p>
      <p>At the town’s sheriff court yesterday, McDonough, 24, was found guilty of assault after provocation.</p>
      <p>He had insisted he lashed out after Mr Wilson, who was out celebrating his 21st birthday, had raised his hands to him first.</p>
      <p>Before being convicted yesterday, McDonough, of Craigsfaulds Avenue, Paisley, told the jury he felt “threatened” before he punched Mr Wilson.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “I just saw him (Mr Wilson) and a couple of other people attacking my friend inside. I felt under attack.”</p>
      <p>When asked by prosecutor Henna Chaudry why he had delivered “quite a considerable punch” to a “small built” man, he replied: “It was self defence. I felt threatened.</p>
      <p>"They were shouting aggressively towards me after I’d just seen them attacking my friend inside.”</p>
      <p>Miss Chaudry then asked: “You are a man of considerable size and you say you felt threatened?”</p>
      <p>McDonough replied: “That’s correct, yes. I would say I was attacked. I felt threatened.</p>
      <p>“I felt like I would’ve been attacked if I’d turned to walk away. I had been pushed or punched. I was retaliating.</p>
      <p>“I was acting in self defence.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Miss Chaudry urged the jury to convict McDonough of the single charge he faced, adding: “This is a 6ft 1ins man with a substantial build and he said two girls shouting at him made him feel under attack.”</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Gordon Ritchie asked the jury to acquit McDonough, saying: “He throws one punch which puts an end to the attack, it puts an end to the assailant walking towards him, and puts an end to the incident, and he is free to leave the scene.</p>
      <p>“It is certainly not excessive force. The only fair verdict you can reach is one of not guilty.”</p>
      <p>After he was found guilty, Sheriff Seith Ireland called for background reports to be prepared ahead of sentencing and McDonough will return to the dock next month to learn his fate.</p>
