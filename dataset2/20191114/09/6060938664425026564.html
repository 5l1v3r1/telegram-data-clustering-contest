      <p>LONDON: Former England skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Michael-Vaughan">Michael Vaughan</a> on Thursday took a dig at the pitch for the first Test between India and Bangladesh at the Holkar Cricket Stadium.</p>
      <p>Despite the brilliant effort from the Indian bowlers in the opening session of the day, Vaughan called the pitch a belter.</p>
      <p>"This Test Match pitch in India is a belter .... #Justsaying #INDvBAN," Vaughan tweeted.</p>

      <p>Earlier, the 45-year-old had also termed the pitch of Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium in Pune as 'boring' when India played South Africa.</p>
      <p>"Test match cricket pitches in India are boring...The first 3/4 days the contest is far too in favour of the bat...needs more action for the bowler...My thought of the day," Vaughan had tweeted.</p>
