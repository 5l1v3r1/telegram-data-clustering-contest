      <h1>'Best chance' - Nottingham Forest tipped to maintain promotion push by former Reds coach</h1>
      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's side are currently fifth in the Championship table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:14:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Former caretaker boss Ian “Charlie” McParland says Nottingham Forest have “the best chance they’ve had for years” of reaching the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It has been <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/a-good-place-nottingham-forest-3534706">a fine start to the season</a> for the Reds under <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a>.</p>
      <p>With 15 games of the campaign gone, they sit fifth in the table, five points behind leaders West Bromwich Albion and with a game in hand.</p>
      <p>They have been beaten just three times in the league, having bounced back from successive defeats after the last international break with wins at Luton Town and at home <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">to arch-rivals Derby County.</a></p>
      <p>The only time they have failed to score in the Championship was in their 1-0 reverse to Wigan Athletic.</p>
      <p>And McParland says <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest's</a> ability to keep finding the back of the net can be key to their bid to clinch promotion.</p>

      <p>“Most of the games they’ve scored one goal,” McParland told Notts TV.</p>
      <p>“Even when they are getting beat 1-0, you think they are going to nick a goal. Or if it’s 0-0, they are capable of nicking a goal.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the season, I said we’d need to see how it pans out, but maybe seventh or sixth position - just getting in the play-offs slightly.</p>
      <p>“But after having a look at all the teams and watching the games, I’m thinking this is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-sabri-lamouchi-championship-3535780">the best chance</a> they’ve had for years of going up. And if they don’t go up this year, I think it’s a failure."</p>
