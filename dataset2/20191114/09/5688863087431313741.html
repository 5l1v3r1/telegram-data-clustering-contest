        <b>Gopal Sankaranarayanan, secretary of the Justice RM Lodha panel which drafted the report that led to reforms within the BCCI, has criticized the board’s move to make major amendments to it. It is understood that the main objective is to remove the ‘cooling-off period’ in the board's constitution. </b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the agenda circulated to its units for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a>’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) on December 1, the newly-elected office-bearers are moving to amend key clauses in BCCI’s new statute. Although elected only in October, president <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sourav_ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> and secretary Jay Shah will have to step down next year unless the AGM tweaks the clause that requires office-bearers to enter a three-year cooling-off period after six years in office, in a state unit or BCCI. However, the Lodha committee members and some former players are not pleased with the development to dilute the clauses which were approved by the Supreme Court in 2016. </p>
      <p>“If they are allowed to, there is no point in the reforms process. Tomorrow, they will recall all the changes they want, take us back to square one, get rid of the players’ association, players’ representatives, conflict of interest resolution, ombudsman; all aspects of it, including the 70-year age cap, cooling off, get rid of it and just sit back. It would be a waste of time for everyone,” Sankaranarayanan said, reported Hindustan Times.</p>
      <p>He also objected to the Supreme Court easing some norms after cricket officials made submissions through amicus curiae PS Narasimha prior to the elections in October. As per Clause 45 in the new constitution, the board has to get the Apex’s court’s approval for any changes to be made. </p>
      <p>“Simply put, the case was over. Nothing else should have been looked at. That judgement, on July 18, 2016, the SC had approved everything of Lodha recommendations, one state-one vote, organisational structure. Once they gave the judgement, the SC itself did not have the jurisdiction to look at the matter further,” he said.</p>
      <p>Justice Lodha himself voiced his opinion against the election of the family members of former office-bearers in an interview to HT last month.</p>
      <p>“This is nepotism of the worst order, people just don’t want to leave the associations,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former India captain Bishan Bedi also spoke out against the developments.</p>
      <p>“This is absolutely, downright appalling. The spirit of Justice Lodha (report) was never allowed to take off, Bedi said.</p>
