      <p>Yesterday, Gallagher teased that new music was on the way after sharing a snippet of the new song from his upcoming, third EP., ‘Blue Moon Rising.’ The EP will be released on March 6 2020.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the single, Noel said: “It was written in Abbey Road last November on the same day I wrote ‘Black Star Dancing’.</p>
      <p>“It’s that good, it sounds like it took 5.4 people to come up with it. It’s already a live standard and we haven’t even played it yet.”</p>
      <p>You can listen to the new song here:</p>

      <p>Gallagher recently released <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-high-flying-birds-this-is-the-place-ep">the acclaimed ‘This Is The Place</a>‘ – the second of three EPs coming in 2019, following on from <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-black-star-dancing-ep-review">June’s ‘Black Star Dancing.’</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-high-flying-birds-this-is-the-place-ep">Reviewing Gallagher’s Manchester-inspired ‘This is the Place’ EP, <i>NME</i> wrote</a>: “To quote Tony Walsh’s poem on the treasures of Manchester: <i>“It’s ace, it’s the best and the songs that we sing, from the stands, from our bands, set the whole planet shaking</i>”. While Gallagher’s done well to remember that, he’s gone back to his roots but taken them to strange new places.</p>
      <p>“Imagine what <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> could have been if they’d have had the bravery to match this bombast in their latter years.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher also recently announced a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-announces-huge-one-off-outdoors-london-gig-2020-2561896">huge one-off headline show</a> at London’s Kenwood House for 2020.</p>
