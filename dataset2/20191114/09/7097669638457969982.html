      <h1>Israel says overnight strike on Gaza house killed Islamic Jihad commander</h1>

      <p>Jerusalem (AFP) - Israel's military said Thursday that an overnight strike in Gaza that Palestinians officials say left eight members of the same family dead killed an Islamic Jihad commander.</p>
      <p>Israeli army spokesman Avichay Adraee said Rasmi Abu Malhous was killed in a raid in the Gaza Strip's Deir al-Balah before a ceasefire took hold on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Adraee alleged on Twitter he was a commander of a rocket unit.</p>
      <p>The Gaza health ministry earlier said eight members of the Abu Malhous family, including five children, were killed in an Israeli strike on their family home.</p>
      <p>Residents and relatives disputed that he was affiliated with Islamic Jihad, saying he had been a military police officer for the Palestinian Authority.</p>
      <p>Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus told AFP: "He was an Islamic Jihad commander and he, like many others, have the tactic of hiding ammunition and military infrastructure in their own residence.</p>
      <p>"Of course we try always to minimise the amount of non-combatants killed or injured," he added.</p>
