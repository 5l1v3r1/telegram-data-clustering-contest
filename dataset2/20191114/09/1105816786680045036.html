      <h1>From sci-fi to science lab: Holograms you can 'feel'</h1>

      <p><b>PARIS: </b>Walking, talking holograms have been a staple of sci-fi films since Princess Leia was magically brought to life in “Star Wars”.</p>
      <p>Now scientists in Britain say they can make even more realistic 3D versions — a butterfly, a globe, an emoji — which can be seen with the naked eye, heard and even felt without the need for any virtual reality systems.</p>
      <p>Writing in the journal Nature, a team at the University of Sussex in southern England, said technology currently in use can create 3D images but they are slow, short-lived and “most importantly, rely on operating principles that cannot produce tactile and auditive content as well”.</p>

      <p>To fill in the picture, so to speak, the team created a prototype called Multimodal Acoustic Trap Display (MATD) which “can simultaneously deliver visual, auditory and tactile content”.</p>
      <p>This uses what is known as “acoustophoresis” — sound waves that move and manipulate an object, in this case, particles — to form an image in a small box containing arrays of very small speakers.</p>
      <p>“Our system traps a particle acoustically and illuminates it with red, green and blue light to control its colour as it quickly scans the display volume,” the team said.</p>
      <p>Since the system is based on sound waves, it allows the hologram to be heard and even felt.</p>
      <p>One of the scientists, Ryuji Hirayama, explained how this last feature — so crucial to making the object seem real — works.</p>

      <p>“Even if not audible to us, ultrasound is still a mechanical wave and it carries energy through the air. Our system directs and focuses this energy, which can then stimulate your skin to feel content,” Hirayama told AFP by email.</p>
      <p>“The feeling of the tactile sensation is like a gently spraying your hand with pressurised air.”</p>
      <p>The system obviously attracts attention because of the science fiction film backdrop but the team said it could have a wide range of applications, from computing to biomedical procedures.</p>
