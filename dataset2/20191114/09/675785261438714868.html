      <p>Kym Marsh's eight-year-old daughter Polly has scored her first film role after following in both her mum and dad's theatrical footsteps.</p>
      <p>The little girl will star in a new film about homelessness called Lead Belly, alongside her actor dad Jamie Lomas and former Emmerdale star Sammy Winward.</p>
      <p>Jamie plays lead character Mark, an armed forces veteran who is suffering from PTSD from his former career.</p>
      <p>Proud mum Kym announced the news on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , telling followers: "So very proud of my beautiful little girl being a part of such an important film. Huge well done to her daddy @jamielomas1 and for everyone involved in this project.</p>

      <p>"Please everybody check out the link below and help support. Thank you," she added.</p>
      <p>Polly is already familiar with the world of showbiz, having grown up with two soap star parents.</p>
      <p>Kym, who left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> after 13 years to help her eldest daughter Emilie with her new baby, will be appearing on stage with Polly in her Elf: The Musical UK tour next month.</p>
      <p>Polly will play the part of a naughty child in a scene with Santa, while Kym takes on the role of Buddy the Elf's girlfriend Jovie.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing that I get to share the next part of my acting journey with Polly," Kym told the Loose Women panel in April.</p>

      <p>"She loves acting and performing, so for her to land her first role aged eight is great, and we're all so proud of her.</p>
      <p>"It's lovely to think she wants to follow in my footsteps and I know she'll do a great job. I think she was born to be in the spotlight â€” she's quite the little character."</p>
      <p>Polly has been learning the trade at her Hollyoaks star dad Jamie's First Take School of Acting in Manchester, of which she "loves every second".</p>
      <p>"I'm going to be some travelling around the country with the theatre tour and I don't want to be away from Polly," Kym wrote in her OK! magazine column earlier this year.</p>

      <p>"I got told there was a small part for her playing one of the children, so it's worked out perfectly!</p>
      <p>"She's been going to her dad's acting school and she's loved every second of it."</p>
      <p>It comes after Jamie was embroiled in a fight with Emmerdale ex-star Asan N'jie at the TV Choice Awards in September.</p>
      <p>Asan, who played Ellis Chapman in the ITV soap, was sacked after the Mirror's video showed him brawling with Jamie and threatening to stab him.</p>
