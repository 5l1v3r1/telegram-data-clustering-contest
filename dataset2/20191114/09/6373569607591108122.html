      <h1>Former Argyle striker Rory Fallon joins New Zealand's coaching staff for international double-header</h1>
      <h2>The All Whites are playing the Republic of Ireland in Dublin tonight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:05:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rupert Metcalf</a></address>
      <p>Ten years to the day since Rory Fall­on headed the goal against Bahrain which earned New Zealand a place at the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, the 37-year-old will be back on duty with the All Whites tonight.</p>
      <p>The former Plymouth Argyle, Torquay United and Truro City striker has been recruited to join New Zealand’s coaching staff for friendly matches against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin this evening and Lithuania in Vilnius on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The head coach of the All Whites, who have not played a competitive fixture for 525 days, is Danny Hay.</p>
      <p>The former Leeds United defender said: “Rory is a hugely passionate New Zealander and hugely passionate about the All Whites, so I think he’s a perfect addition.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s going to be an ideal conduit between myself and the players, and I don’t think anybody knows New Zealand or All Whites culture more than him.”</p>
      <p>Fallon brought his playing career to an end after he was called up for his country’s World Cup qualifying play-offs against Peru two years ago, but was not given any game-time as the All Whites were unable to book a ticket to Russia.</p>
      <p>Plymouth-based Fallon has being doing some coaching work this season with Argyle’s under-14 players, including, at times, with manager Ryan Lowe's son, Alfie.</p>
      <p>Fallon is now moving up to the international stage, on which he is following in his father’s footsteps.</p>
      <p>Kevin Fallon was assistant head coach of the All Whites at the first of their two appearances at the World Cup finals, in Spain in 1982.</p>
      <p>Rory Fallon is glad to be back on board with the national team, in response to Hay’s summons.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="http://stuff.co.nz/">stuff.co.nz</a>: "He [Hay] just said he wants to build an amazing team culture, like we had in 2010 for the World Cup, and, looking back at that time, a lot of the amazing stuff we did was because of the team culture.</p>
      <p>“There were a few great individuals, but it was down to the team performance and the squad performance, and Danny is hoping to rebuild that, because it has probably not been as tight in recent times."</p>
      <p>Fallon was also glad to recall his famous feat exactly a decade ago in Wellington.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s one of those nights that people will never forget, but I’m hoping that there will be more nights like that.</p>
      <p>“There are still things we want to achieve as the All Whites, there are still things we want to do, there’s still more history to be made and more tales to be told.</p>
      <p>“It’s surreal to think it has been ten years, but I’m looking forward to achieving something new now as well.”</p>
