      <p>Survivors are particularly keen for 1.06 as it is due to launch alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/25/dayz-update-map-livonia-dlc-ps4-xbox-pc/">Livonia, a new map being added to DayZ</a>. Here’s a brief description:</p>
      <blockquote>The Livonia region brings a fresh new experience to the post-apocalyptic world of DayZ. With vast green landscapes, dense expansive forests, serene lakes, and winding rivers, the 163km2 Livonia map offers the perfect backdrop for any survivor lost in the wild.</blockquote>
      <p>We reviewed DayZ when it finally launched on PlayStation 4 earlier this year and, well, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/06/dayz-ps4-review-console-release/">we weren’t too pleased</a>. Still, we’ll be jumping back into the game to explore Livonia when the new map arrives.</p>
