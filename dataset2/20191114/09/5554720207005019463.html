      <p>The woman told a local newspaper that her husband assaulted her violently on Sunday night. “He punched more on my eyes, twisted my hands backwards, and hit me on my ribs, on my neck and my head. I thought I would die,” she told Khaleej Times.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the woman’s video surfaced only two days after Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, passed a new family protection law to prevent domestic abuse and protect victims.</p>
