      <h1>Protect our Pensioners: Paisley Daily Express hand out campaign stickers to combat doorstep crooks</h1>
      <h2>The bright and informative stickers will be given out to hundreds of pensioners living in the community as part of our Protect our Pensioners campaign.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:49:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:49</time> by <a rel="author">Carla Talbot, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/carla-talbot/</a></address>
      <p>The Paisley Daily Express’ campaign to tackle bogus callers will help protect pensioners in their homes as we prepare to hand out hundreds of campaign stickers.</p>
      <p>Print &amp; Copy It in the town’s High Street printed 400 labels which the local company provided free of charge.</p>
      <p>The bright and informative stickers are set to be given out to hundreds of pensioners living in the community.</p>
      <p>Each one gives tips for people who may be unsure of anyone at their door and urges them to call the police if they feel scared or threatened.</p>
      <p>The special stickers also include our Nominate a Neighbour scheme, which encourages OAPs to write details of someone they trust who they can contact if someone they don’t know comes to their door.</p>
      <p>Paisley Daily Express editor Gavin McInally said: “The Nominate a Neighbour scheme gives elderly people a bit more security if someone comes to their door they can give them a call and ask them to come and assist.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the time, just the idea of another person coming over to verify what someone at the door is saying is enough to scare them off.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“These stickers are our next step in helping to protect the elderly people in Renfrewshire who are being targeted by crooks.</p>
      <p>“We want to get as many out there as possible across the local authority and help make people aware of what they should do if they feel unsafe.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful to William and his staff at Print &amp; Copy It for helping us get our message out there.”</p>

      <p>Our campaign has already celebrated success, having made its way to Holyrood where it was given a special mention by MSP Neil Bibby in Scottish Parliament.</p>
      <p>We have highlighted a number of shocking cases across the area, including an 89-year-old man with dementia who was conned out of £30,000 by bogus workmen and a 68-year-old who lost a five-figure sum of cash in a cruel Bitcoin scam.</p>
      <p>Come of the country’s largest companies such as Scottish Water and Bank of Scotland have also thrown their weight behind the campaign.</p>
      <p>Both businesses already make valiant efforts to stop callous crooks using their company name as a front to carry out crime.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Protect Our Pensioners stickers have been praised by both elderly support charity Roar - Connections for Life and Police Scotland - who are backing the campaign.</p>
      <p>Nicola Hanssen, CEO of Roar - Connections for Life said: “Roar is delighted to support PDE’s Protect our Pensioners Campaign and we want to protect older people physically as well as financially.”</p>
      <p>Inspector Tracy Harkins, from Paisley’s community policing team, said: “These stickers will be a practical and visible reminder for older people against the dangers of bogus callers.</p>
      <p>“They will undoubtedly help to prevent crimes against some of the most vulnerable members of our society and I would encourage older people or their families to get one.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, bogus double-glazing salesmen are operating in Paisley, police have warned.</p>

      <p>A crew of dodgy workers offered householders in Alice Street windows on The Green Deal - a now defunct government funding scheme.</p>
      <p>Police say the conmen, who were dressed in dark clothing, appeared in the south end of the town between 2pm and 2.30pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the four men were driving a white van and a white Volkswagon Polo.</p>
      <p>One of the suspects was wearing an official looking lanyard.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They offered work on The Green Deal, which was a government initiative launched in 2013 to encourage consumers to make energy-saving improvements to their home, such as loft insulation or double glazing.</p>
      <p>However, funding was pulled for the scheme in 2015.</p>
      <p>Inspector Tracy Harkins, from Paisley Police office, urged people to be aware of the bogus callers offering the deal and urged anyone who spots them to call the police.</p>
      <p>She told the Paisley Daily Express said: “These men approached homeowners in Paisley’s Alice Street offering to install windows financed by the Green Deal.</p>
      <p>“The Green Deal ended in 2015, so it appears this is a scam.</p>
      <p>“I would urge householders approached in this way to be very careful and not engage.</p>
