      <p>Michael Schumacher's manager has lifted the lid on the "emotional" day for the German icon after he romped to his maiden Formula One world championship 25 years ago.</p>
      <p>The legendary seven-time world champ Schumacher is best remembered for winning five successive titles with Ferrari, adding to the two he previously won with Benetton.</p>
      <p>Indeed, his first triumph in 1994 was secured in a nail-biting, season-closing race in Australia after a relentless battle with Britain's Damon Hill.</p>
      <p>And his achievements have now been immortalised in a new poster which celebrates his success on the track.</p>
      <p>The poster is designed to raise funds for his Keep Fighting Foundation.</p>

      <p>His manager Sabine Kehm, on behalf of the Schumacher family, said: “We are delighted to be raising money for the Keep Fighting Foundation through partnering with ZOOM on this poster.</p>
      <p>"Michael’s first championship was a very special moment in his career and 25 years later this poster brings back emotional memories of that time.”</p>
      <p>The poster shows the legendary seven-times champion at the wheel of the Benetton B194 that he drove to victory in the 1994 season.</p>

      <p>The image is inspired by the Art Deco posters of F1's past and is the tenth in the series, following posters featuring famous drivers and circuits such as Nigel Mansell, Circuit of The Americas, Silverstone and Monaco.</p>
      <p>The Keep Fighting Foundation will receive a donation from the sale of each print.</p>
      <p>Schumacher was left in a coma after suffering a traumatic brain injury during a skiing trip on December 29, 2013.</p>
      <p>His health status is reasonably unknown, with updates rare as the Schumacher family look to maintain privacy for the Ferrari icon.</p>
