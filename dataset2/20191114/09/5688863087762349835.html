      <h1>Joe Root and Chris Silverwood 'aligned' over the idea of regaining the Ashes</h1>

        <b>England skipper Joe Root believes that him and coach Chris Silverwood are making a proper plan to regain the Ashes. England have been deeply hurt by not being able to regain the Ashes in their home conditions and thus they will be keen to build a team capable to compete in Australian conditions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Australia, on the back of some amazing batting from <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steve_smith">Steve Smith</a>, were able to retain the Ashes for the first time in England since 2001. It was a shock since the England bowlers were expected to be twice as difficult to face in swinging conditions but they were completely outplayed in all three departments. England have 25 Tests to go before the next Ashes series comes around Down Under.</p>
      <p>Thus skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/joe_root">Joe Root</a> is very keen to have his coach Chris Silverwood's support in trying to build a team that can compete in Australian conditions and can bring home the Urn. One of the major changes that Root is going to do with the series against New Zealand is that he will resume batting at number four again which was his preferred batting spot.</p>
      <p>"It definitely fits in with captaincy a little bit better for me. I've found over time that, generally, I've consistently played better in that position," Root told bbc.com.</p>
      <p>Silverwood, after his appointment, had clearly mentioned that winning the Ashes back is one of the top priorities for him as a coach and skipper Joe Root really believes in the intent of the coach and looks forward to building a strong team for achieving that objective.</p>
      <p>"We know that over the next couple of years we want to do everything we can to be in the best shape possible to go down to Australia and win. We've got 25 games to build on that journey and make sure when we go down there we're in a really strong position to take on Australia in their conditions," he asserted.</p>
      <p>England's Joe Denly is expected to play at number three to help Root bat at his number four position and England will be banking on all-rounders like Chris Woakes and Sam Curran who will try to be impressive in the practice game against New Zealand A and will be ready for the First Test atÂ Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>"We haven't officially picked a team yet. As you'd expect, the majority of that will go and play the first Test match," Root concluded.</p>
