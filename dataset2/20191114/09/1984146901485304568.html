      <h1>How Jetro Willems is quietly going about proving his worth at Newcastle United</h1>
      <h2>On-loan wing-back Jetro Willems is impressing with hard work and end product in his opening few months at Newcastle United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:24:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Musgrove</a></address>
      <p>While Allan Saint-Maximin and Jonjo Shelvey picked up the plaudits for their performances in the victory over West Ham - there's one man who perhaps slipped under the radar.</p>
      <p>Loanee Jetro Willems chalked up yet another impressive performance against AFC Bournemouth, having put in a MOTM performance the weekend before against West Ham.</p>
      <p>In that game he set up the second goal for with a pinpoint cross for Federico Fernandez, and is quietly working away to proving he's worth a permanent deal at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>For what seemed an eternity Newcastle have searched for a capable left-back to offer <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/paul-dummett">Paul Dummett</a> competition - and in Willems they could well have found what they were looking for.</p>
      <p>Well scouted, Bruce described Willems as someone who would 'give us another strong option on that left side', and the 26-year-old has proved just that.</p>
      <p>From an awkward introduction to Premier League football just a few days after he signed as he came on against Arsenal - the defender has now cemented himself in the first team. </p>
      <p>Here's how he's quietly going about his business.</p>
      <h3>Providing a much-needed attacking outlet down the left</h3>
      <p>Aided by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Matt Ritchie's</a> injury in the cup, Willems has been given an easier passage into the first team than he perhaps thought he would have.</p>
      <p>But with Dummett, and Javier Manquillo also capable of playing in the same position - and not the best of debuts again Arsenal - Willems has had to prove he's worthy of place in the starting XI.</p>
      <p>A rampaging wing-back is crucial for the way that Bruce has set up his United side - and Willems is just that.</p>
      <p>He's got a confidence, which has grown over the last month, to get forward and, more importantly, has that end product.</p>
      <p>We saw that with the assist for Matty Longstaff's goal against Manchester United where Willems had the vision to turn back and tee up the debutant to strike home, and again at West Ham.</p>
      <p>In fact from his heatmap for the season so far, you can see just how far up the left flank he is in games - which allows those in-front of him to attack with more freedom.</p>

      <p>Willems is willing to pick the ball up at the back and begin the attack - and with 1.3 key passes per game on average this season (third highest) and 1.1 dribble per game on average (fourth highest), his desire to get forward is evident.</p>
      <p>But yet again the point about end product is an important one to highlight - tallying fourth out of those who have played regularly this season when it comes to average pass success rate (76.3%) is crucial.</p>
      <p>It's the short passes to those in the middle of the park which are key to starting off an attack, and accuracy is important to make sure they pay off.</p>
      <h3>Stamina is important - and Willems has quite the engine yet remains disciplined </h3>
      <p>It's all good having the desire to get forward but if your wing-back is unable to get back in position and leaves your defence exposed, then there is little benefit.</p>
      <p>But watching Willems closely, he is up and down the pitch more than most.</p>
      <p>It's clear that he is disciplined - his runs are timed, and calculated rather than at whim, and that approach causes havoc for defenders.</p>
      <p>Yet again you can pinpoint the goal against Manchester United but there are also other examples in his 665 minutes of action which highlights his running ability.</p>
      <p>For example against Brighton when the ball is picked up on the edge of the box, Willems burst forward and into space - it's only Miguel Almiron's poor pass which doesn't put him through.</p>

      <p>Against Leicester City in the Carabao Cup - again where he had a mixed game - there was a moment where Willems goes on a lung-busting run, and makes a last-ditch challenge to deny what some might say was a certain goal.</p>
      <p>Having gone up the field, and been caught on a counter - Willems put in his all to get back with a goal-saving interception.</p>
      <p>This desire at both ends of the field is an important asset.</p>

      <h3>His defensive ability is also an attacking asset</h3>
      <p>With Newcastle having limited time on the ball so far this season, Willems has been busy defending as much as attacking, but his capabilities in the back line acts as a much as weapon going forward as it does at the back.</p>
      <p>His quick feet - which allows him to keep up with the opposition but also react fast to loose balls or interceptions, is a great tool to set United on a counter.</p>
      <p>According to the stats, he's put in the third highest average tackles per game - most which lead to a counter.</p>
      <p>A prime example of this was against Wolves where he defended admirably against Adama Traore.</p>
      <p>With the Wolves winger looking to take Willems on, the wing-back stands strong, and gets a foot in but does not stop there  - the loose ball is put forward, and Willems joins in the attack.</p>
      <p>He continues his run up the left, leaving Wolves struggling to contain the counter - and as above, only the wrong pass stops the attack.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Against Watford we saw Willems use this strength wonderfully - coming deep to pick a pass from Jamaal Lascelles, he turns in-between two defenders, strides forward and picks out Joelinton with a 20-yard pass.</p>
      <p>Willems continues to go forward, splitting the defence as Christian Atsu takes up the position on the left, and eventually crosses into Miguel Almiron who fired straight at Ben Foster.</p>

      <p>As if to highlight Willems' importance further - on average 40% of Newcastle's attacks this season have come down the left - Willems pace and vision is crucial to this.</p>
