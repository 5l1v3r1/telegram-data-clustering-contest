      <h2>Ayr Sheriff Court was told that Hans McLarty, 55, of Merrick Drive, Dalmellington, paid back the outstanding amount.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:36:10+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Behan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-behan/</a></address>
      <p>McLarty was heavily fined, however, and will be made subject to a tag, prohibiting him from leaving his house between certain hours for the next nine weeks.</p>
      <p>McLarty appeared at the sheriff court last week and admitted failing to give prompt notification to East Ayrshire Council over a change in circumstances which he knew would affect his housing benefit.</p>
      <p>The offence happened between December 2013 and August 2018 and he obtained £6,000 which he was not entitled to.</p>
      <p>The charge also stated that McLarty had too much savings to qualify for the benefits.</p>
      <p>The original charge alleged that he obtained as much as £14,000 but this was reduced to £6000.</p>
      <p>McLarty’s solicitor said: “All the housing benefit has been paid.</p>
      <p>“He’s someone who is not keeping very well and he found himself in hospital for a week. He’s going to have an endoscopy.</p>
      <p>“He’s somebody who has significant health issues.</p>
      <p>“He’s worried about a custodial sentence and it’s affected his health.</p>
      <p>“Prior to falling ill he had a very strong work history and felt aggrieved he was on benefits and put out of work, down to his own ill-health.</p>
      <p>“He accepts full responsibility. It’s a failure to notify a change of circumstances but the money was not spent on luxuries.</p>
      <p>“It was simply sitting in the bank and he has repaid that housing benefit and did it off his own back.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff David Young QC told McLarty: “This is a case where I have to consider custody.</p>
      <p>“However, I take into account you have repaid the money, your lack of convictions and your state of health. I can avoid imposing custody.”</p>
      <p>McLarty was fined £900, payable at £40 per fortnight, and placed on a curfew order, meaning he cannot leave his home between 7pm and 7am for the next nine weeks.</p>
