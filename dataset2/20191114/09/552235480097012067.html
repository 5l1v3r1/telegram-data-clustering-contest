      <h1>Ambitious plans for campaign to protect domestic abuse victims in West Dunbartonshire</h1>
      <h2>Peter Barry spoke to the Lennox Herald about the No Home for Domestic Abuse campaign - with a conference on the matter taking place today.</h2>

      <p>Ambitious plans to prevent people becoming victims of domestic abuse have been laid out by the man behind a first-of-its-kind campaign to protect those suffering at the hands of their partner.</p>
      <p>Peter Barry told the Lennox Herald last week that his ultimate aim is to stop domestic abuse from happening in the first place, ahead of a revolutionary event to get people talking about the issue.</p>
      <p>Although pleased with the results of a strong move to protect victims in their own homes by using the full force of anti-social behaviour laws to ensure the perpetrator is legally removed, the West Dunbartonshire Council housing chief says the authorities must continue to be bold in how they deal with the problem.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Peter said: “All we are doing is supporting victims who are already victims. We want to get to a place where we don’t have victims.</p>
      <p>“We are never going to get rid of domestic abuse entirely but we have to set the bar high.”</p>
      <p>This will be the focus of the revolutionary No Home for Domestic Abuse - Breaking the Cycle conference which takes place in Clydebank this Thursday.</p>
      <p>Peter went on: “We want to start a major conversation in this area.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, we want to look at how we can prevent this but before we get to that we want to see how the communities demonstrate that it’s unacceptable within our society.</p>
      <p>“Every time a new case is presented to my team and to the police, it’s not known to us but it was known to somebody, somebody’s sister, somebody’s neighbour, someone in the community.</p>
      <p>“We need to empower people to speak out without having any qualms about it.”</p>

      <p>West Dunbartonshire consistently ranks as one of the worst areas in Scotland for domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>And, as part of a hard-hitting plan to make the area safe for people who have been abused by partners, the council have pushed housing legislation to the limit through the No Home for Domestic Abuse scheme.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Becoming the first social landlord in Scotland to implement a zero tolerance policy of the crime within its properties, it gives victims support to remain in their own home if they wish and uses a range of measures including helping to change locks and install security measures (such as CCTV) in addition to giving them access to legal assistance.</p>
      <p>Peter, who is strategic lead for housing with the local authority, explained the benefits of the initiative and added: “We are seeing the evidence from the No Home for Domestic Abuse campaign which has been running since June 2018 that there have been 180 to 185 cases of people we have supported.</p>
      <p>“Every month there are 10 to 15 cases.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good thing because people are coming forward but on the other hand, it’s sad that that is the case.”</p>
      <p>And Peter is keen for other councils and social landlords to follow West Dunbartonshire Council’s lead to take dramatic action and stop people becoming victims.</p>
      <p>He continued: “There’s a significant pushback against domestic abuse in the housing sector and a number of agencies are trying to make a stand.</p>
      <p>“We are yet to see a significant rollout although that is what I am calling for.</p>
      <p>“A number of housing bodies I think are a bit reluctant.</p>
      <p>“It is not getting there as quick as I would like.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t take risks but we really challenged the law with this.</p>
      <p>“All of the housing associations in West Dunbartonshire are signed up.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Another massive step forward in the fight against the scourge of domestic abuse was taken earlier this year when new laws were introduced in April across Scotland.</p>
      <p>The change in legislation makes psychological harm and coercive and controlling behaviour a criminal offence while previous laws only protected women from physical abuse.</p>
      <p>Peter added: “Early indications from the police are encouraging.</p>
      <p>“People have the right to live in dignity and peace with the people providing them love, shelter and comfort.</p>
      <p>“It’s very difficult but under no circumstances are we going to stop trying to tackle this issue.”</p>
      <p>West Dunbartonshire Council are operating what Peter calls a “three-pronged approach” to tackling domestic abuse involving action by authorities, in schools making the next generation aware of what domestic abuse is and alsofrom the community.</p>
      <p>This week’s event will be attended by Dumbarton District Women’s Aid, addiction services and the police.</p>
