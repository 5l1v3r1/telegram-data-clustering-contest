      <p>The manhunt for a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/us/marine-suspect-virginia-killing-camp-lejeune/index.html">Marine deserter wanted for murder</a> led Roanoke, Virginia, police to shut down all schools in the city Thursday.</p>
      <p>Authorities received a call about 4 a.m. regarding a sighting of Michael Alexander Brown, 22, who is suspected of killing his mother's boyfriend last week in the nearby town of Hardy, about 9 miles east of Roanoke.</p>
      <p>The caller told investigators that a man in a black jacket was tapping on a house window, Roanoke Police Chief Tim Jones said. Officers responded and were "able to confirm to the best of our ability that it was Mr. Brown," Jones said.</p>
      <p>Though Franklin County authorities said earlier this week that Brown was driving a 2008 Lincoln Town Car, Jones said Brown was believed to be driving an RV in Roanoke.</p>
      <p>The RV, located nearby, was secured by a tactical team, he said. Brown was believed to be on foot, perhaps looking for another vehicle, Jones said.</p>
      <p>Brown deserted his post at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina last month, police said.</p>
      <p>Around noon Saturday, the Franklin County Sheriff's Office responded to a shooting call in Hardy, where they found Rodney Brown, 54, dead in his home, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Rodney Brown's girlfriend -- who is Michael Brown's mother -- called police after finding Rodney's body in the house, said Capt. Phillip Young with the sheriff's office.</p>
      <p>Michael Brown is charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony. The motive in the killing is unclear.</p>
      <p>He is considered dangerous and may be armed with a "shoulder-held, high-capacity weapon," Jones said. He has family ties in the Roanoke area, the chief said.</p>
      <p>The Franklin County Sheriff's Office warned the public Monday that Brown was armed with a high-powered firearm and possibly other weapons.</p>
      <p>He is known to frequent national parks and forests, and he may be living in the woods, the sheriff's office said this week.</p>
      <p>Anyone who sees him should use caution and call police. Brown stands about 6 feet tall, weighs 154 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes, police said.</p>
      <p>"He is navigationally savvy," Jones said. "He knows how to move around. He's not afraid to change his location. He's not afraid to change his look."</p>
      <p>In addition to asking Roanoke students, faculty and staff not to report to school Thursday, police also want anyone who lives within a half mile of Patrick Henry High School on Grandin Road to shelter in place and keep their doors locked.</p>
      <p>About 2,000 students attend the high school.</p>
      <p>The US Marshals Service is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Brown's apprehension, Jones said.</p>
