      <h1>Islamic Jihad offers terms for Gaza truce</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:56:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad has offered terms for an Egyptian-mediated Gaza ceasefire with Israel, saying that if these were not met it could continue cross-border attacks indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Fighting erupted after Israel carried out a <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/13/gaza-israel-strike/">targeted air strike killing Islamic Jihad’s top field commander in the Gaza Strip</a> on Tuesday (local time).</p>
      <p>With ensuing strikes in response to a surge in Palestinian rocket fire, a total of 26 people in Gaza, mostly militants, have died.</p>
      <p>The terms laid out by Islamic Jihad leader Zeyad al-Nakhala in an interview with Al-Mayadeen TV included Israel ending targeted killings and lethal responses to Gaza border protests, as well as measures to ease the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian enclave.</p>
      <p>Al-Nakhala said he expected to hear Israel’s response via Cairo within hours.</p>
      <p>Should a truce not be agreed, he said, “the (Islamic Jihad armed wing) Jerusalem Brigades is able to manage the battle, and for a long time”.</p>
