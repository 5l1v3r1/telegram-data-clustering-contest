      <p>Realme has <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/09/26198realme-x2-pro-india-launch-date-revealed5/">scheduled</a> an event for November 20 to unveil the much anticipated Realme X2 Pro in India. A couple of days back, the brand even <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/realme-5s-coming-soon-ae323yyy1w-store?affid=HotDeals20&amp;affExtParam2=redpixel&amp;affExtParam1=24926919">teased</a> Realme 5s with a massive 5,000 mAh battery. And now, Flipkart has a dedicated page for the phone revealing 48MP quad-camera setup and November 20 launch date. Hence, we can now confirm that Realme 5s will make its debut alongside the Realme X2 Pro at the same event.</p>

      <p>As far as the specifications are concerned, the upcoming Realme 5s will come with 48MP(sensor unknown at the moment) quad-camera setup,  a step-up from the regular Realme 5 and a massive 5,000 mAh battery similar to its predecessor. According to a BIS(Bureau of Indian Standards) certification, this forthcoming phone will bear the model number RMX1925 which coincidentally lines with Realme XT’s model number – RMX1921. Whereas, the Realme 5 and Realme 5 Pro packs model numbers RMX1911 and RMX1971 which are different from that of Realme 5s.</p>
      <p>Apart from the above details, nothing much is known about this impending budget smartphone from Realme. Anyways, we expect it to be priced around ₹9,999 to go toe-to-toe with the Redmi Note 8 from Xiaomi. On the other hand, the regular Realme 5 now starts at ₹8,999 after a recent price drop imposed by the brand.</p>
