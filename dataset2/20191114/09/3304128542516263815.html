      <h1>Lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi Warns Of Civil War Over Uhuru, Ruto Rift</h1>

      <p>Renowned Kenyan lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi has warned of a possible civil war in case President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto part ways.</p>
      <p>For the past months, the rifts in Jubilee party have been made evident, despite the President and his Deputy playing it “cool”.</p>
      <p>The Kibra by election for instance, has exposed the rift in the Jubilee party, with Ruto now accusing ODM leader Raila Odinga of using the handshake to divide Jubilee.</p>
      <p>The President initiated the handshake between him and Raila, and any opposition by Ruto shows that the two might not be reading from the same script.</p>
      <p>According to Abdullahi, the rift might cause a civil war and a method of reaching an agreement should be sought as earlier as possible.</p>

      <p>Abdullahi terms the civil war a long, bloody one that will detail the need of a referee, rules and arbitration.</p>
      <p>“H.E Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto need to agree on (a) the RULES of this CIVIL WAR, (b) the REFEREE, (c) an ARBITRATION clause…looks like it will be a very bloody and long CIVIL WAR,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>This follows an early morning tackle by the Deputy President William Ruto where he rubbished the claims that a group of handshake leaders were calling for his resignation for fighting the President’s projects including the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).</p>
      <p>Ruto has blamed the Kibra by-election loss to ODM’s Imran Okoth, accusing Mr Odinga of using goons, violence and militia.</p>

      <p>He added that Raila was using the divide and conquer tactic to destroy the Jubilee party with the handshake to his advantage.</p>
      <p>“Waheshimiwa, the real SABOTEUR is your master the people’s conman who uses deceit to divide/destroy parties even UHURU’s Jubilee;the master of chaos who factors violence in election equations;the one who never accepts defeat. We’ll stand with UHURU&amp;Jubilee against such dictators,” read the tweet.</p>
      <p>In response to his tweet, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party Secretary General Edwin Sifuna questioned why the DP Ruto was so furious about the outcomes of Kibra by elections.</p>
      <p>Sifuna stated that the problem was in Ruto’s bedroom, alluding that he should face his boss and address the problems instead of frustrating other government officials.</p>

      <p>The Kibra seat was left vacant after the demise of Ken Okoth who succumbed after a long fight with cancer. Jubilee, under Uhuru had opted out of the race to pave way for the ODM candidate Imran Okoth in retrospect to the handshake.</p>
      <p>However, Jubilee under Ruto fielded McDonald Mariga, as their candidate with heavy campaign machinery.</p>
      <p>ODM’s Imran emerged the winner with 24,636 votes, followed by Jubilee’s Mariga with 11,230 votes.</p>
      <p>Eliud Owalo of ANC) came third with 5,275 votes followed by Khamisi Butichi of Ford Kenya with 260 votes.</p>
