      <p>About 1,000 children ran a race in thick smog in the Indian capital New Delhi on Thursday, drawing criticism from people on social media, as schools were closed due to hazardous air quality.</p>
      <p>The air quality index on Thursday was at a staggering 472 on a scale of 500, indicating possible serious respiratory risks for the general public, according to SAFAR, a government pollution monitor.</p>
      <p>Air quality has remained <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/delhi-gasps-eye-burning-smog-worst-pollution-crisis-191104051205498.html">hazardous</a> for three consecutive days, which prompted the Environment Pollution Prevention &amp; Control Authority (EPCA), a body appointed by the Supreme Court, to order the shutting down of schools late on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The New Delhi government followed suit and "ordered all government and public schools to remain shut on Thursday and Friday".</p>
      <p>The city government has already restricted private cars until November 15 with an "odd-even" system, banning them on alternate days based on licence plate numbers.</p>
      <p>India has 14 of the world's 15 most polluted cities, according to the World Health Organization (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/world-health-organisation.html">WHO</a>).</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/narendra-modi-141021134051524.html">Narendra Modi</a> has not spoken about the crisis even though he frequently takes to Twitter to promote his priorities.</p>
      <h3>'Theatre of the absurd'</h3>
      <p>Angry residents took to social media and blamed authorities for organising the run.</p>
      <p>"Run for Children...in severe pollution? Theatre of the absurd," said Shashank Jaitely, a Twitter user.</p>

      <p>India's ANI news agency <a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1194903046939009024">tweeted</a> pictures of several children running without protective masks as part of the annual Run for Children, organised by a not-for-profit group called Prayas that runs programmes for child protection, juvenile justice and education.</p>
      <p>The annual run, near New Delhi's diplomatic enclave, was organised to mark the birth anniversary of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a>'s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, which is celebrated as Children's Day.</p>
      <p>"The children did not run a long distance. It was a short run," Prayas's general secretary, Amod K Kanth, told the Reuters News Agency.</p>
      <p>"They come voluntarily here ... We got permissions from the police, permission from the government, permission for this place," said Kanth, a former senior police officer. He said the organisers did not have any directions from authorities to cancel the event.</p>
      <p>The city government had no immediate comment.</p>
