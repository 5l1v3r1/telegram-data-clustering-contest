      <p>The army is interrogating locals from Ywartharyar Village in Yochaung area, Myebon Township whether they have associated with the Arakan Army (AA) or not and if they have been found guilty, they will be taken action against laws, said Col. General Staff Win Zaw Oo, spokesperson of Western Command.</p>
      <p>An army column arrived at the village on November 9 and arrested five villagers on November 12 for interrogation, he said.</p>
      <p>“We are interrogating them and if they don’t have close relation with the AA, we will not take them action. If they provided assistance to the AA, they will be taken action against laws. We interrogated them as we have information about the connection with the AA,” said the colonel.</p>
      <p>Army columns were frequently attacked by mines when they passed Ywartharyar Village and nearby villages, he said.</p>
      <p>The army interrogated 11 villagers and detained five of them for further interrogation. Although the army left the village, they are stationed at Yochaung Bridge.</p>
      <p>An attack occurred near Ywartharyar Village on November 10 and a pregnant woman was killed. Although sources said she was killed by the soldiers, Col. Win Zaw Oo denied it.</p>
      <p>Fighting broke out between army and AA occurred in eight townships in Rakhine State and the AA also detained and killed some government staffs, retired military men and village administrators as they are accused of being army informers.</p>
