      <h3>Barcelona’s Ivan Rakitic breaks his silence about his lack of playing time this season.</h3>
      <p>Ivan Rakitic has not enjoyed his best season under Barcelona and the Croatian midfielder has finally opened up about it.</p>
      <p>Rakitic has gone on the television program “Universo Valdano” and talked about how difficult this season has been for him.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barcas-rakitic-opens-up-theyve-taken-the-ball-away-from-me--im-sad-7733623?_ga=2.99269594.555741812.1573737824-57082032.1573737824"><b>Sport</b></a>, he said,</p>
      <blockquote>“How can I enjoy myself? Playing football. Playing football. How does my youngest daughter feel if I take her toy from her? She’s sad. I feel the same: they have taken the ball from me and I am sad.”</blockquote>
      <p>Up until this season, Rakitic had been a stalwart under both Ernesto Valverde and Luis Enrique. He took over the starting spot in midfield when Xavi left and has generally performed when called upon.</p>
      <p>However, upon the arrival of Frenkie de Jong, he’s seen his minutes dwindle dramatically and has only started once so far. Despite not featuring, outwardly he understands Ernesto Valverde’s decision.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barcas-rakitic-opens-up-theyve-taken-the-ball-away-from-me--im-sad-7733623?_ga=2.99269594.555741812.1573737824-57082032.1573737824"><b>Rakitic said</b></a>,</p>
      <blockquote>“I understand and respect the decisions made by the coach and the club, but I think I’ve given a lot in the last five and bit years here and the only thing I want is to be able to keep enjoying myself. That’s the most important thing for me.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rakitic has long been the subject of <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/05/barca-looking-to-exchange-rakitic-or-vidal-for-sensi/"><b>transfer rumors</b></a> with the player being over 30 years old and Barcelona looking to build a younger squad. So far, teams in Serie A have shown the most interest.</p>
      <p>Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde was asked about his midfielder’s comments following the friendly match against Cartagena. According to <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/11/13/5dcc7ce7268e3eda438b4585.html"><b>Marca</b></a>, he said,</p>
      <blockquote>“I have nothing to say about Ivan’s comments.”</blockquote>
      <p>A strange response considering how much Valverde has relied on Rakitic. However, he did comment about his injury and said that they hope it’s only an inconvenience and he’ll be ready for the team’s next game.</p>
      <p>For what it’s worth, Dinamo Zagreb manager <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/bjelica-ivan-rakitic-will-leave-in-the-winter-window-7734783"><b>Nenad Bjelica</b></a> said that he believes Rakitic will leave in the summer and that it will be a good move for both him and the club. Whether that happens will remain a wait and see.</p>
