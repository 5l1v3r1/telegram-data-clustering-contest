      <h2>Joe Gomez's dad, Gus, said he was proud of the way his son has dealt with the situation and said that Sterling was not to blame for the heated exchange during the match</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:23:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Rudd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-rudd/</a></address>
      <p>Raheem Sterling's clash with Joe Gomez was sparked by Liverpool fans "agitating" the former Reds player, claims Gomez's father.</p>
      <p>Augustus Gomez, 59, believes the duo's initial heated exchange was borne out of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star's "frustration" during Sunday's match.</p>
      <p>Liverpool fans repeatedly booed whenever Sterling was on the ball and chants of 'there's only one greedy b*****d' could be heard around the ground.</p>
      <p>Gus said: “It is normal. Young people are very ambitious and very willing to win for their team and that is what happens. If <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were losing, one of the players would be agitated as well.</p>
      <p>“Raheem Sterling - it is not his fault. Fans were agitating him and he took it out because of his frustration.</p>
      <p>“We all understand that; it is football, we are human beings.”</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to Mirror.co.uk at his home in south east London, Gus said Joe was “not expecting” the bust-up with Sterling when he arrived at the Three Lions' Burton base on Monday - less than 24 hours after the pair clashed during Liverpool's 3-1 win over Man City at Anfield - but he was proud of how he handled the situation.</p>

      <p>Augustus said: “He wasn’t expecting it, it happened, he brushed it away and he carried on. He trained today, he is fine apart from the scratch on his face.</p>
      <p>“He is fine, he is definitely fine. I spoke to him, I spoke to his agent; let him just be happy and smiling and so-forth.</p>
      <p>“He is very passionate about what he does.</p>
      <p>“Raheem apologised.</p>
      <p>“We just want to see that Joe is happy, that his wife is happy, we are happy and that is it."</p>
      <p>A former Charlton youngster who signed for Liverpool in 2015, 22 year-old Gomez - who has seven England caps to his name so far - is the third of five children who all play football.</p>
      <p>Dad Gus revealed the words of advice he gave his son this week following both incidents.</p>
      <p>He said: “I have asked him to stay low.</p>
      <p>“As a public figure like him, you need to try and be a public figure for the children, for his friends, his family and so on.</p>
      <p>“He wants to be like a normal person and run around like normal on the pitch, smile and be happy, go home, be with his wife and his son.</p>
      <p>“His main focus now is to play football and to forget about the hype. It is something he does not want to talk about. He keeps his head low."</p>
      <p>Mr Gomez said he and his son’s outlook is to “do good things and be happy” and that he is proud of how he dealt with the situation.</p>
