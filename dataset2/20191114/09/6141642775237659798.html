      <p>A non-stop Qantas flight from London to Sydney has taken off from Heathrow.</p>
      <p>The Australian airline is using the flight to research the impact of ultra-long haul trips on passengers and crew.</p>
      <p>Forty people are on board the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner which took off at 6am on Thursday for the 19-hour flight to the other side of the world.</p>
      <p>A Dreamliner can usually carry between 230 and 300 people.</p>

      <p>Currently it is impossible to fly a plane at full capacity from London to cities on the east coast of Australia without stopping to refuel.</p>
      <p>Qantas began flying non-stop from London to Perth in Western Australia in March 2018, as it is 1,600 miles closer.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s flight is part of Project Sunrise, a bid to operate commercial flights from Sydney to London and New York by 2022 if plane makers Airbus or Boeing can provide a suitable aircraft.</p>
      <p>Qantas said all carbon emissions from the test flight will be fully offset.</p>

      <p>Those on board are mostly Qantas employees fitted with monitors to track their sleep patterns, food and drink intake and physical movements.</p>
      <p>The data will be assessed by researchers at the University of Sydney to assess the impact of the flight on their health, wellbeing and body clock.</p>
      <p>A team from Melbourne’s Monash University is working with pilots and crew to monitor melatonin levels before, during and after the flight. Melatonin is the hormone that regulates sleep cycles.</p>
      <p>Pilots are wearing a device that tracks brain wave patterns and monitors alertness.</p>
      <blockquote><b>19<br/></b>Approximate hours of flight time<cite>Qantas</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Qantas will also gather feedback from passengers on food choices, stretching and wellbeing zones, and in-flight entertainment.</p>
      <p>The airline’s chief executive Alan Joyce said previously: “Ultra-long haul flying presents a lot of common sense questions about the comfort and wellbeing of passengers and crew.</p>
      <p>“These flights are going to provide invaluable data to help answer them.”</p>
      <p>It will be the second aircraft to fly the route non-stop – the first touched down in August 1989.</p>
      <p>Qantas flew a Dreamliner non-stop from New York to Sydney last month as part of Project Sunrise, although the route is around 1,000 miles shorter.</p>
      <p>It is due to make a final decision on the viability of Project Sunrise as a commercial flight route by the end of the year.</p>
