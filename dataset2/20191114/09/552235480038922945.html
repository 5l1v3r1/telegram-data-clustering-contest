      <p>Celtic assistant manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> will be Hibs' next manager as the Leith side's hunt for the next boss continues.</p>

      <p>We revealed the Hoops would have demanded £300,000 in compensation if an offer from the Leith side was forthcoming.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs'</a> search for their next boss continues with chief executive Leeann Dempster heading up the search to find Paul Heckingbottom's successor.</p>
      <p>Kennedy is Neil Lennon's trusted No.2 and enjoyed a close relationship with previous bosses Brendan Rodgers and Ronny Deila.</p>

      <p>He said:  “Since I arrived he’s been there for me. When you arrive somewhere new it’s sometimes difficult.</p>
      <p>“You can have some tough times to settle and things like that. He was always there and showed me the good stuff I was doing as well as the bad stuff.</p>
      <p>“I’m so happy to have this guy close to me. He made me learn some things about the club and how to play. I’m really happy to have him on my side.</p>
      <p>“I talked about how his career went but not with him. But I just see he’s in a really good place right now.</p>
      <p>“What he’s teaching and doing for us on the field is really good."</p>
