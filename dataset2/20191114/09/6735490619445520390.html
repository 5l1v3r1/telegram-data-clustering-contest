      <p>“No one cared about us in 2005, we were just coming up, and basically to get other gigs we listed the other acts that we’d opened up for,” he explained. “But that just meant that we were on the outside stage in the parking lot, while you were playing for 40,000 people.”</p>
      <p>He did add, “But you helped us get a lot of gigs after that. We owe you 20 per cent.”</p>
