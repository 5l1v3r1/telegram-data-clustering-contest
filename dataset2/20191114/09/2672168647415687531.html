      <p>Myanmar Human Rights Commission (MHRC) should launch investigation into the arrests and killings of Hindu, Thet, Rakhine, Bamar, Shan and Chin nationals from northern Shan State and northern Rakhine State, a member of parliament has said.</p>
      <p>Lower House MP Thaung Aye for Pyawbwe Township made the remark following a report submitted by the commission on its activities from January to September 24 this year.</p>
      <p>He said the commission dealt with 725 of 2,376 complaints but there were only three rounds of investigations.</p>
      <p>"Parliamentary representatives and people will be very grateful if the human rights commission is to responsibly take action and investigate the arrests, rapes, threats and killings of national people such as Hindu, Mro, Thet, Rakhin, Bamar, Shan and Chin in northern Shan State and northern Rakhine State. As Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, the commission should do more so that the State and the government can protect people's right to life, liberty and security," the MP commented.</p>
      <p>He added that all people have equal rights regardless of their age, gender, place, job, designation, code of ethics, religion or culture.</p>
