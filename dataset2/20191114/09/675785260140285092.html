      <h1>Khabib Nurmagomedov doesn't enjoy his victories - except over Conor McGregor</h1>
      <h2>Nurmagomedov has won each of his 28 mixed martial arts fights - but insists he does not enjoy his victories</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:39:24+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has revealed the only fight he enjoyed winning was his victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> .</p>
      <p>The UFC lightweight champion has yet to taste defeat after 28 fights in mixed martial arts.</p>
      <p>But he claims he has not enjoyed his most recent victories despite establishing himself as one of the best in the world.</p>
      <p>Except, that is, his win over McGregor last year when he choked out the Irishman in the fourth round.</p>
      <p>"At the beginning, when you're just starting out and winning fights, it brings you some sort of pleasure. You enjoy it," Nurmagomedov said.</p>

      <p>"Recently I haven’t had that. In the last couple of years I’ve gone out there and won and it doesn't bring me any real joy to be honest.</p>
      <p>"Well, with the exception of one fight, let’s say. In that fight I beat that guy [Conor McGregor] with pleasure, I'll tell you.</p>
      <p>"I had fights in my career where I understood that I could hurt my opponent more, but I’d talk to him, tell him to give up so that I don’t beat him too hard.</p>
      <p>"For example, if I had a painful hold where I could break something, I wouldn’t tighten it all the way, it’d just fix it so that the opponent would tap out.</p>

      <p>"Because I have no aim to hurt anyone in this sport. Yes, we compete in a very brutal combat sport, but it’s never my goal to inflict a lot of pain on my opponent. If I understand that I’m winning, I don’t aim to hurt someone bad. Well, except for one fight."</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov defeated Dustin Poirier in September to retain his 155lb title and will defend it against Tony Ferguson in April or May next year.</p>
      <p>But he has ruled out a boxing fight with Floyd Mayweather which both men have proposed since Mayweather beat McGregor in 2017.</p>
      <p>"I think it would be better for me to fight Tony Ferguson rather than Floyd at this stage of my career," Nurmagomedov said. “I’m more focused on MMA.</p>
      <p>"If he moved to MMA we would fight but I don’t think it’s possible. I don’t have plans to have a boxing fight next year."</p>
