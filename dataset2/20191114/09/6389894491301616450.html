      <h1>UK retail sales unexpectedly fall as economy slows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:59:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Robertson</a></address>
      <p>The amount of goods sold in UK shops unexpectedly fell in October, official figures have shown, in the latest sign that the economy is slowing.</p>
      <p>The weak performance will be a concern to retailers as the sector heads towards Christmas, especially given that the period covered Halloween, a traditionally busy time for shops.</p>

      <p>UK retail sales dropped 0.1 per cent last month compared to September, when sales stagnated, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Economists had been expecting a 0.2 per cent increase.</p>
      <p>In the three months to October, retail sales grew 0.2 per cent compared with the previous three months, the lowest growth since April 2018.</p>
      <p>“This morning’s retail sales figures – which once again show households cautious in their spending – suggest it could be a long, hard winter,” said Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity. “The sales periods around Black Friday and Christmas will, once again, prove crucial.”</p>
      <p>A series of data releases this week have showed that the UK economy is losing momentum. Economic growth fell to its slowest annual rate in nearly a decade in the third quarter, while the employment market shed 58,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>Consumer spending has been a strong point in 2019 while business investment and manufacturing have suffered under Brexit uncertainty. Today’s figures indicate it is slowing, however.</p>
      <p>Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “At least some of last month’s weakness may reflect the recent weakness in the labour market with fewer people in employment and wage growth slowing.”</p>
      <p>Monk said the upcoming General Election – the first in winter since 1923 – “is likely to prompt further caution amongst spenders”.</p>
      <p>Lynda Petherick, UK head of retail at Accenture, said: “These latest ONS figures are symptomatic of the challenges facing the retail sector after a year fraught with uncertainty.”</p>
      <p>Online sales continued to grow as a proportion of all retailing. They increased to 19.2 per cent in October from 19 per cent in September.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, department stores reported their strongest month-on-month growth this year, with the quantity of goods bought increasing two per cent. Fuel sales were also a bright spot, growing 1.5 per cent month on month.</p>

      <p>However, excluding the volatile category of fuel, overall sales fell by an even sharper 0.3 per cent month on month.</p>
      <p>Pugh said: “Overall, it is increasingly clear that the risks to our forecast for GDP growth of 0.2 per cent quarter on quarter in the fourth quarter appear on the downside.”</p>
