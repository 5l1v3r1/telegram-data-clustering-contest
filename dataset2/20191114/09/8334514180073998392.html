      <p>The election will pit the incumbent Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, candidate of the ruling center-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), against the candidate of the Social Democrats and former prime minister Zoran Milanovic. Two independent candidates also have solid support in the polls.</p>
      <p>The job is largely ceremonial. The president cannot veto laws but has a say in foreign policy and defense.</p>
      <p>According to the most recent opinion poll, in the first round of the vote Grabar-Kitarovic can expect support of some 29 percent of voters, while Milanovic is second with 24 percent.</p>
      <p>Miroslav Skoro, popular singer and largely seen as the candidate of the right-wing nationalist conservatives, came third with 17 percent and a former judge Mislav Kolakusic got 14 percent.</p>
      <p>Altogether around a dozen people voiced their intention to run for the presidency, among them a showbiz celebrity who was also a Playboy model. They all now have to collect 10,000 signatures of citizens in the next 10 days to confirm their candidacy.</p>
      <p>Grabar-Kitarovic’s five-year term is seen by some observers as having little policy substance domestically while often trying to promote her popularity through populist patriotic rhetoric.</p>
      <p>She has been somewhat more concrete in foreign policy, promoting the so-called “Three Seas Initiative”, a stage for boosting political and economic ties between the European Union members in central and eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>If no one wins an outright majority in the first round, the second round will take place on Jan. 5, 2020.</p>
      <p>The results of the presidential election will also be an early indication of the mood among the voters ahead of the parliamentary election due to take place in late 2020.</p>
