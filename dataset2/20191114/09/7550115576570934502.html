      <p>Wales forward Wilson is on a season-long loan from Liverpool and scored his fourth goal for the Cherries at Newcastle last weekend.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been a <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> regular as Eddie Howe’s side have climbed into the top half of the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a>, and says Klopp has had time to keep track on him despite overseeing leaders Liverpool’s unbeaten start to the season.</p>
      <p>“I am always in touch with Liverpool, they have a loan guy there who I am in contact with every week, and I get the odd message off the manager,” Wilson said.</p>
      <p>“He says he has been watching and after I scored against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> he congratulated me on the goal. He messaged and said ‘great free-kick!’</p>
      <p>“It gives you a boost to see that, and it is great he is keeping an eye on me.</p>
      <p>“It is good to know when you go out on loan you are not forgotten about.</p>
      <p>“I’m still in contact with a few of the lads and if I can get to a game I always will.</p>
      <p>“To see Liverpool win the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> would be fantastic being a Liverpool fan.</p>
      <p>“But to get to the Euros with Wales would be just as special.”</p>

      <p>Wilson would win his 16th cap by playing in the crunch Euro 2020 qualifier against Azerbaijan in Baku on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Wales need to win their final two qualifiers, in Azerbaijan and at home to Hungary on Tuesday, to keep alive hopes of automatic qualification for next summer’s European Championship finals.</p>
      <p>And having experienced Euro 2016, when Wales reached the semi-finals, as a supporter, Wilson is keen to sample the tournament as a player this time.</p>
      <p>“It would mean everything to get there,” Wilson said.</p>
      <p>“When I was stood there in the crowd in France, I wanted to be a part of that as a player.</p>
      <p>“Now I have an opportunity to do that, and I am desperate to make sure we get over the line.</p>
      <p>“We know we have to win both games, but we’re confident we can do it if we execute our game-plan.”</p>

      <p>Azerbaijan are bottom of Group E with only one point from six games.</p>
      <p>But Wales had to rely on a late Gareth Bale header to beat them 2-1 in Cardiff in September.</p>
      <p>“Azerbaijan made it a lot tougher for us at home than we thought, so we are definitely going to show them respect,” Wilson said.</p>
      <p>“They were well organised defensively and good on the break</p>
      <p>“We know what they are good at and where we can hurt them.</p>
      <p>“But they will be wary of us the way we have played the last two games.”</p>
