      <h1>Mindoro fishers get 30 boats</h1>

      <h3>At least 30 units of 20-foot fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) boats complete with fishing accessories and 6.5 horsepower marine engines have been distributed to the fisherfolks in Occidental Mindoro who were affected by typhoon Quiel.</h3>
      <p>The Department of Agriculture–Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DA-BFAR) Region IVB said that aside from the distribution of the P1.95-million worth FRP boats, they will also distribute boat-construction materials such as plywood, epoxy and nails  for the repair of partially-damaged boats below 3.0 gross tons.</p>
      <p>FRP boats are considered to be better alternatives to traditional boats. Boats of this kind are sturdier and are more resistant to rot, corrosion and harsh marine environments than their wooden counterparts.</p>
      <p>Also, mass producing and repairing FRP boats are easier for the fisherfolk affected by the typhoon.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of Agriculture Secretary Dr. William Dar, the DA is strongly committed to further strengthen its immediate assistance efforts to respond to distressed farmers and fisherfolk during calamities.</p>
