      <p><b>Moses Sumney</b> has announced a followup to his <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/brooklynvegans-top-50-albums-of-2017/">great</a> 2017 debut album <i>Aromanticism</i>. As <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/moses-sumney-announces-new-double-album-grae-shares-new-song-virile/">Pitchfork</a> points out, it’s a double album called <i>græ</i>, and it will be released in two parts. The first part comes out digitally in February 2020, and the second part (and physical release) comes out May 15 via Jagjaguwar. The first single is “Virile,” which is clearly a step forward for Moses and finds him taking his sound in directions he’s never gone before. It’s a pretty wild song, and it comes with a self-directed video which is Moses’ directorial debut. Check it out, along with the tracklist, below.</p>
