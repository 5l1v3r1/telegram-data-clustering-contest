      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/maserati/">Maserati</a> will <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/11/maserati-granturismo-zeda-model-ends-production/">end production of the GranTurismo and the GranCabrio</a> in November 2019, and it will retool the historic Modena, Italy, factory that makes both models in preparation for a new <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/performance/">sports car</a> due out in 2020. But <i>Autoblog</i> learned production of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/4c/">Alfa Romeo 4C</a> made in the same facility will continue even after the retooling, debunking <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/rumormill/">rumors</a> of the model's immediate demise.</p>
      <p>"Production of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/4c/">4C</a> will continue in the same production plant/line until late 2020 for the NAFTA and APAC regions," an <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/">Alfa Romeo</a> spokesperson told us via email.</p>
      <p>The factory will close during the retooling, so "there will just be some weeks of technical interruption" during the process, according to the same spokesperson. Production will resume as soon as the overhaul is completed, and Alfa's carbon fiber-intensive two-seater will be built alongside <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/02/12/maserati-granturismo-plant-closes-alfieri/">Maserati's next sports car</a>. North American enthusiasts still have time to put a new 4C in their garage.</p>
      <p>Available only as a convertible, the 4C <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/02/07/alfa-romeo-4c-spider-italia-chicago-auto-show/">recently entered the 2020 model year</a> with a limited-edition model named Italia that gains an array of visual add-ons, like piano black trim on the front end. Just 15 Italias will be built, but the standard 4C remains available as a regular-production model. It's powered by a mid-mounted, 1.75-liter four-cylinder engine turbocharged to 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. The engine's displacement wasn't chosen at random; Alfisti will know right off the bat that it echoes the 1750 engine Alfa offered in the late 1960s and the early 1970s.</p>
      <p>European enthusiasts aren't as lucky. <i>Autoblog</i> also confirmed <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/07/alfa-romeo-4c-spider-future-uncertain/">an earlier report</a> claiming 4C production for the European, Middle Eastern, and African markets ended in August 2018.</p>
      <p>While the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/maserati/granturismo/">GranTurismo</a> will be <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/01/next-generation-maserati-gran-turismo-gran-cabrio-confirmed/">replaced by a new model in 2021</a>, what the future holds for the 4C is up in the air. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/11/alfa-romeo-electrification-plans-reorganization/">Alfa Romeo's product plan</a> doesn't currently include a second-generation 4C, which is too bad. It's one of the purest, most undiluted sports car on the market; may it live long.</p>
