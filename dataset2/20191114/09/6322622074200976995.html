      <p>BENGALURU (Nov 14): Southeast Asian stock markets retreated on Thursday, with Indonesia losing the most, as risk sentiment received a hit following a slew of gloomy data from China, the region's biggest trade partner.</p>
      <p>China's industrial production growth slowed sharply in October as it logged a 4.7% rise but came in well below a <i>Reuters </i>forecast, while investment growth touched a record low and retail sales also missed expectations.</p>
      <p>The weak economic print highlights the aftermath of the country's longstanding tariff dispute with the US and a depletion of demand in advanced economies, hence, "export-led industrial production will remain under pressure," DBS bank analysts said in a note.</p>
      <p>Against this backdrop, China's GDP growth is likely to slow further to 5.8% in the fourth quarter, down from 6% in the previous quarter, they added.</p>
      <p>Indonesian shares dropped 0.7% to their lowest in more than one month on weakness in telcos and financials.</p>
      <p>Coal mining companies also suffered following recent reports of China suspending imports of the commodity, said Anugerah Zamzami Nasr, equity research analyst at Phillip Sekuritas Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Coal producers Bayan Resources Tbk PT and Adaro Energy Tbk PT tumbled 6.9% and 2.6%, respectively.</p>
      <p>An index of Jakarta's 45 most liquid stocks gave up 1.1%.</p>
      <p>Industrial stocks pulled Singapore's index lower as conglomerate Jaridne Matheson Holdings Ltd shed 1.9%.</p>
      <p>The Philippine bourse also dipped, with a 5% slump in Jollibee Foods Inc sagging the index.</p>
      <p>The Asian fastfood giant reported a sharp decline in third-quarter net income due to continued underperformance of its US venture Smashburger and Red Ribbon at home.</p>
      <p>After market hours, the Philippine central bank announced that it would hold the benchmark interest rate steady, as was widely expected, after reporting a stronger-than-expected economic growth in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Malaysian benchmark slipped, dragged by IHH Healthcare Bhd and telecom major Axiata group Bhd.</p>
      <p>In other news, cruise line operator Genting Malaysia Bhd jumped 2.2% to top the benchmark after it said shareholders of US-based Empire Resorts Inc voted in favour of merging with the company.</p>
      <p>Thai shares also declined as energy stocks faltered.</p>
