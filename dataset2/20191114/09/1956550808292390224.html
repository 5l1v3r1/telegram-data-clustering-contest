        <figcaption>If there’s one thing people visit Sharjah for, it’s definitely the <a href="https://www.timeoutsharjah.com/culture">culture</a> – and the emirate could soon be getting another <a href="https://www.timeoutsharjah.com/culture/art/418541-autumn-season-kicks-off-at-sharjah-art-foundation-this-weekend">art museum</a>. <br/><br/>The design for the Barjeel Museum for Modern Arab <a href="https://www.timeoutsharjah.com/culture/421013-ten-top-uae-art-and-culture-spots-in-2019">Art</a>, which will be located on the periphery of Sharjah, has already won the Tamayouz Excellence Award’s Rifat Chadirji Prize.<br/><br/>The fortress-like structure, which will feature a number of wind towers that will keep the building cool, will have below-ground galleries to shield the artwork from sun exposure.<br/><br/>Rolando Rodriguez-Leal, Natalia Wrzask and Jose Luis Mulás from AIDIA Studio designed the winning project.<br/>The judges of the Rifat Chadirji Prize said of the design, “This project features elegant graphics and a beautifully thought-through analysis. It very cleverly interprets regional architectural, social and vernacular expressions.<br/>“The roof, made of wood and based on a traditional Emirati weaving structure, generates a contemporary motif that naturally filters daylight and creates surprisingly high – and beautiful – semi-public spaces and landscapes, such as the sculpture route and walkway.<br/><br/>“The woven quality of the roof further allows the walls to be dynamic, as shade patterns created by the sun’s changing position during the day dances across them. The walls therefore become a festive skin.”<br/><br/>No announcements have been made about when construction will begin, nor has there been a provisional opening date for the museum.</figcaption>
