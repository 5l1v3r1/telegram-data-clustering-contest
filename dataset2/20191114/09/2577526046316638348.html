      <h1>Twitch Streamer Sentenced After Assaulting Pregnant Girlfriend During Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:00:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Last year, <i>Fortnite </i>streamer Luke “MrDeadMoth” Munday <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2018/12/10/man-arrested-for-alleged-domestic-abuse-recorded-during-fortnite-stream">was heard assaulting his then-pregnant girlfriend during a stream in front of the pair’s two children</a>. After being arrested in December 2018, he was sentenced earlier this week, and found guilty of a “single count of common assault (domestic violence).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/aussie-gamer-avoids-jail-after-admitting-to-assault-during-a-fortnite-stream/">As <i>Kotaku Australia</i> reports</a>, he has been handed a “14-month community corrections order”, which in the Australian state of New South Wales where the hearing took place basically means community service.</p>
      <p>During Munday’s sentencing, his defence lawyer said “He’s a loving, caring person with no history of domestic violence... who unfortunately on this day just slapped his partner.” The lawyer’s use of the word “just”, and his pleas for a more lenient sentence, drew what the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/fortnite-gamer-luke-munday-escapes-jail-term/11699820"><i>ABC </i>describe</a> as a “sharp rebuke” from the judge.</p>
      <p>Since the assault took place Munday has lost his job and separated from his partner.</p>
