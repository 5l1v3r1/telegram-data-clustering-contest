      <h2>Norwegian youngster Erling Braut Haaland is being watched by a host of top clubs - but Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly ready to make his move</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:54:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly decided he wants to sign Erling Braut Haaland.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian striker has been a revelation at Red Bull Salzburg this season, scoring seven Champions League goals already this season amongst 26 goals in 18 games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Haaland's form has put top European clubs on red-alert - and Norwegian newspaper <a href="https://www.dagbladet.no/sport/solskjaer-er-langt-framme-i-koen/71810469">Dagbladet</a> says United are now ready to pull the trigger and make their move for the teenager.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is said to have put around the message that he wants a reunion with his former Molde striker at Old Trafford, with a move likely to materialise next summer.</p>

      <p>United are in the market for attacking reinforcements in January after the departures of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez in January.</p>
      <p>Mario Mandzukic is said to be close to a move as a short-term solution, but Haaland could be a key signing in the long-term.</p>
      <p>He is likely to remain at Salzburg until the end of the season having settled in Austria and with the club chasing several pieces of silverware.</p>
      <p>But he has already been named a key target by Solskjaer, who has outlined what he believes his worth to be to club bosses to put the wheels in motion for negotiations to begin.</p>

      <p>Haaland is also believed to recognise a full pre-season could give him the best opportunity to successfully adapt to the demands of the Premier League next season.</p>
      <p>He recently outlined the impact of Solskjaer on his early career as he ponders a reunion with the man who handed him his senior debut.</p>
      <p>"He has had a huge impact on my life, both as a person and as a trainer," Haaland told TV2.</p>
      <p>"He won the Champions League and was an incredibly good player. He has taught me a lot."</p>
