      <h1>Former Sunderland boss Jack Ross reportedly wanted by two major city rivals</h1>
      <h2>Ross has been out of the game since being sacked by Sunderland last month but reportedly has options north of the border</h2>

      <p>Former Sunderland manager Jack Ross could reportedly be at the centre of a tug of war between Edinburgh rivals Hibernian and Hearts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> was sacked as <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> manager in October after an indifferent start to their 2019/20 campaign but is said to have two opportunities to return to work back in his native Scotland.</p>
      <p>Having guided St Mirren to promotion from the Scottish Championship, his stock remains high north of the border and he is said to now be Hibernian's number one choice to succeed Paul Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>The former Barnsley and Leeds boss was sacked by the Hibees earlier this month but according to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4951671/celtic-john-kennedy-ends-hibs-talk/">the Scottish Sun,</a> they had originally lined up a move for Celtic assistant manager John Kennedy to become their new manager.</p>
      <p>However, Kennedy has since committed his future to the Scottish champions and the same publication now reports that Hibs owner Ron Gordon is now set to turn his attentions towards Ross.</p>
      <p>However, Hearts are also said to be keen in Ross' services after they sacked Craig Levein last month. Former Crystal Palace boss Dougie Freedman, former Nottingham Forest and Derby manager Billy Davies and ex-Fulham manager Felix Magath are also said to be in the frame for the Tynecastle hotseat.</p>
      <p>During his first season as Black Cats boss, Ross guided Sunderland to two Wembley finals but it was his failure to win promotion from League One which proved fatal.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old was replaced by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson,</a> who has won just two of his opening eight matches in charge.</p>
