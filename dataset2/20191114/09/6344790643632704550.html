      <h1>Did You See That? RWBY Volume 7 Episode 2</h1>

      <p>Another week has come and gone, which means a new episode of <b><i>RWBY</i></b> from Rooster Teeth is out! I know that not everyone will have seen the episode as there’s a week delay between when First Members can watch it and when the general public can, so if you haven’t seen it yet, bookmark this article and wait until you get the chance to watch it because there are spoilers ahead.</p>

      <p>I want to start off by revisiting something that my brother pointed out from the first episode. Ironwood’s top team of huntsmen and huntresses is called Ace-Ops which is like Aesop’s (the fables we all grew up on). This will actually play a part later.</p>
      <p>So, in this episode, the heroes are taken to Atlas Academy, and on the way there, they meet a protester who talks about Robin Hill and her Happy Huntresses. Does that sound like a literary character to anyone!? Well, when they get to Atlas Academy, they quickly are met by Ironwood, Winter, and Penny by happenstance, and Winter demands that the heroes be released from their high-tech handcuffs. Everyone gets caught up with each other, and after finding out that the heroes stole an Atlas ship, Winter freaks out. It makes me so happy to always be reminded that Winter has a heart and emotions. It makes me happy.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that while Ironwood seemingly is being very straight with the heroes, Ruby does hold back some information. She doesn’t tell him about Djinn or that there is still one question that can be asked of her. Nor does Ruby mention that Ozpin disappeared after Djinn told them the whole history of Salem. I think that she’s smart to not be completely forthcoming with Ironwood at this moment.</p>
      <p>Ironwood explains that his plan is to turn Amnity Coliseum into a new communications tower for the world. In order to protect the new tower from Salem and Grimm, Ironwood plans on launching it into the atmosphere as a satellite. This is a good idea until space Grimm become a thing. The tricky part is Ironwood’s next part of the plan. He wants to tell everyone about Salem. This isn’t inherently bad, but I don’t think his approach has been the best. He withdrew his forces to help defend Atlas when the panic starts there as that will not only cause unrest from the citizens but also the resulting Grimm attacks. Once again, this isn’t a bad idea per se. However, the way that he’s been treating Mantel is what raises my concerns. It has led to many citizens of the kingdom to not like or trust Ironwood. I’m really worried about what’s going to happen down there.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Ironwood offers Atlas’s high-tech resources to the group, which explains the wardrobe changes that we’re all looking forward to. I’m interested to see if they change up their weapons. I think I saw some changes to Jaune’s shield in the new opening credits, so I’m very intrigued.</p>
      <p>So, let’s go back to that whole Ace-Ops thing. We don’t know the name of all the members of Ace-Ops, but the heroes do meet them again at the Academy, and we do find out that one of them is named Hare. Get it? My guess is that the one who addresses her is somehow the Tortoise from the story. There appears to be a dog or wolf, but there are a lot of fables around canines, so we’ll see what we get.</p>
      <p>Finally, we see the evil Dr. Watts as he talks to Tyrion. We find out that Watts is trying to do some hacking and can’t do it in Atlas because they’ve changed some coding. However, they didn’t change things down in Mantel where he currently is. We also find out that he was the one that designed their cybersecurity which explains how Cinder was able to so easily hack the system. The episode closes with Tyrion leaving a building and we see blood pooling out of the door he exits from. Who did he just murder? Was it just to secure a new hideout for him and Watts?</p>
      <p>What did you think of this latest episode? What do you think of Ironwood’s plan? Was Ruby right in not disclosing everything to Ironwood?</p>
