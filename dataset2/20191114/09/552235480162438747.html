      <h2>Hospitalwatch chairman Jim Moohan is not concerned by the latest revelations.</h2>

      <p>Lab services at the Vale of Leven Hospital are under review.</p>
      <p>Despite repeated assurances that the future of the Alexandria facility is secure, last week it emerged that bosses are to scrutinise the services provided locally.</p>
      <p>But they have stressed that no decision have been taken about the services provided by the Vale of Leven labs.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Currently, labs at the Vale carry out biochemistry and haematology.</p>
      <p>An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokeswoman said: “Over the next few months we will carry out a review of the Vale’s lab services and what diagnostic tests are carried out there, to ensure that we provide the most efficient and effective laboratory service to the Vale of Leven hospital. Similar reviews have been carried out in other areas within Greater Glasgow and Clyde both in other Clyde hospitals and in Glasgow hospitals.</p>
      <p>“Most importantly, patients will experience no change in the care they receive as a result of any changes introduced.”</p>
      <p>Responding to the worries, Jackie Baillie MSP said: “The last time they reviewed labs at the Vale of Leven Hospital, we lost more services.</p>
      <p>“They need to reassure the local community that there will be no change other than an increase in lab services at the Vale.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hospitalwatch chairman Jim Moohan said, since speaking to bosses about the review, he is not concerned about the future of the service.</p>

      <p>He explained that the pressure group will continue to be consulted on any changes to services at the hospital adding: “If there are any proposals to change any services or facilities, the health board will bring them to our table to discuss. That’s what they have promised us.”</p>
