      <h1>PlayStation 5 concept video gives hint at what Sony's 2020 console could look like</h1>
      <h2>The video includes several animated 3D renders of the console based on rumours, as well as the minimal details already revealed by Sony</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T09:12:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>There’s still well over a year to go before Sony finally unveils its <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> console, but a new concept video gives us a hint of what to expect.</p>
      <p>The video, created by TURN ON, includes several animated 3D renders of the console based on rumours, as well as the minimal details already revealed by Sony.</p>
      <p>Key features highlighted in the video, which was first reported by <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-playstation-5-media-markt/">LetsGoDigital</a> , include an 8K resolution, 3D audio, and an SSD, rather than an HDD.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNKh2UKERLo&amp;feature=emb_title">video</a> also gives us a glimpse at the PlayStation 5 controller, which Sony has already revealed several details on.</p>
      <p>The controller will have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, giving gamers real-time feedback during games.</p>

      <p>This was confirmed in a blog by CEO, Jim Ryan, back in October.</p>
      <p>He said: “There are two key innovations with the PlayStation 5’s new controller. First, we’re adopting haptic feedback to replace the “rumble” technology found in controllers since the 5th generation of consoles.</p>
      <p>“With haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field. You can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.</p>

      <p>“The second innovation is something we call adaptive triggers, which have been incorporated into the trigger buttons (L2/R2).</p>
      <p>“Developers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain. In combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there’s still a bit of a wait before the PlayStation 5 is finally unveiled - Sony has confirmed a launch date of ‘Holiday 2020’.</p>
