      <p>Cape Town – Katherine Langford's deleted scene in <b>Avengers: Endgame</b> can now finally be seen.</p>
      <p>Although the <i>13 Reasons Why</i> actress was cast in the film fans were confused when she didn't appear in the theatrically released version earlier this year as her scene never made the final cut.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday the film was released on Disney's streaming service with the addition of the deleted scene.</p>
      <p>According to CoverMedia, it is a devastating goodbye between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and his daughter, Morgan (Langford).</p>
      <p>The scene titled <i>Tony at the Way Station </i>takes place in a realm, not unlike the one in which Thanos finds himself during the end of <i>Avengers Infinity War</i>, explains <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/12/entertainment/avengers-endgame-tony-stark-adult-morgan/index.html"><b>CNN</b></a>.</p>
      <p>What follows is a conversation between Tony and Morgan, who is now an adult.</p>
      <p>He questions whether he made the right decision to sacrifice himself; she reassures him, telling him she is proud of him.</p>
