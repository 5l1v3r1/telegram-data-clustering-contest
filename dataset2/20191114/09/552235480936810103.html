      <h1>'Toxic' levels of lead found in drinking water at Scots family home</h1>
      <h2>Test results found the amount of lead in Suneeta Rathore’s mains supply to be eight times above recommended limits.</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kirkcudbright">Kirkcudbright</a> mum has has turned off the taps after “toxic” levels of lead were found in the water at her home.</p>
      <p>Test results found the amount of lead in Suneeta Rathore’s mains supply to be eight times above recommended limits.</p>
      <p>The contamination means Suneeta and her son must use bottled water for drinking and cooking.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-water">Scottish Water</a> detected the problem at the former police house on High Street after a plumber advised Suneeta to get it checked. “My supply of water is very toxic,” said the 53-year-old, who is awaiting blood test results.</p>
      <p>“The levels are over eight times the regulatory safe standard. I have got written confirmation and the results.</p>
      <p>“I have a 10-year-old who has been raised on that water since he was seven months old.</p>
      <p>“In my financial state, I need help to get my water changed. I am just trying to make my water safe.”</p>

      <p>Suneeta, who runs Pleat clothes shop on St Mary’s Street, believes nearby properties could also be affected.</p>
      <p>She said: “It could be that all these communal pipes are in properties belonging to the police station.</p>
      <p>“There’s a detached house, a semi-detached house and the police station itself.</p>
      <p>“Scottish Water have assured me the pipes are not lead on their side. But beyond that the pipes are lead.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Dougie Campbell helped Suneeta source bottled water from Scottish Water then the council.</p>
      <p>He said: “I recognise the wider implications that there may be other properties in the local area that may have lead pipes.</p>
      <p>“I have contacted senior council officers and Scottish Water managers so that they can take the appropriate action.”</p>
      <p>A Scottish Water spokesperson said: “The cause of the raised levels of lead at the property can most likely be attributed to lead pipes or fittings, either in the property or in the street outside.</p>
      <p>“We have advised a small number of our customers in the area to check if their pipework is made of lead and arrange to have it replaced.</p>
      <p>“Scottish Water have inspected the public water mains and can confirm we found no lead pipes at this location.”</p>
      <p>A council spokesperson said: “As soon as environmental health became aware of the result of the water sample, taken by Scottish Water, we notified public health medicine at Dumfries and Galloway NHS.</p>
      <p>“NHS D&amp;G provided relevant health information and will monitor and screen residents.</p>
      <p>“Strategic housing will continue to offer support to residents to ensure that the issue can be resolved.</p>
      <p>“There is a possibility that residents that have been identified and contacted by Scottish Water may come forward to request assistance.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to liaise with partner agencies to address any further issues that may arise.”</p>
