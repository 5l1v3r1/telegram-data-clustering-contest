          <u>Click through the mini-gallery above to see the three left-sided central midfield maestro options for SA's Real Madrid Dream Team!</u>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 1: Santiago Solari (2000-2005)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid manager Santiago Solari moved from Atletico Madrid to the Santiago Bernabeu in 2000. He quickly established himself as a starter and made the left side of midfield his own. Reliable, skilful and hard-working, the Argentine made a total of 209 appearances for Los Blancos, scoring 22 goals and getting 19 assists along the way. He also helped Real win the UEFA Champions League in 2002, as well as two LaLiga titles, two Spanish Super Cups, one FIFA Club World Cup and one UEFA Super Cup. </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 2: Mesut Ozil (2010-2013)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although a seemingly divisive figure at Arsenal, one cannot debate the levels of Mesut Ozil's performances for Real Madrid during his three years in the Spanish capital. As an accurate passer of the ball, his creativity is unquestionable. Under Jose Mourinho's guidance, the German had a telepathic understanding with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. At Los Blancos, the German racked up an impressive 80 assists in 159 appearances, in addition to scoring 27 goals. He also helped Real win their record-breaking 100-point LaLiga title in 2012, one Copa Del Ray and one Spanish Super Cup during his time at the club. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Option 3: Luka Modric (2012-present)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being the only Ballon d'Or winner among our three options, it's clear that Luka Modric is a fantastic player. Although slight in stature, his presence is felt in midfield. Blessed with great ability, he manipulates the ball with great ease and certainty. In addition to that, he also has a keen eye for a pass and has chipped in with some lovely goals too. Having made 311 appearances to date for Los Blancos, scoring 18 goals and assisting a further 49 strikes, the Croatian was fundamental to Real Madrid's four most recent UEFA Champions League triumphs. He has also won one LaLiga title, four FIFA Club World Cups, two Spanish Super Cups and three UEFA Super Cups with the Madrid giants.</p>
