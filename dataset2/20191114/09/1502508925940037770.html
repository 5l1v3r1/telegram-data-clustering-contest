      <p>The election of Pravind Jugnauth as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mauritius">Mauritius </a>prime minister has created a buzz in the district's Rasra area, from where his ancestors are said to have migrated to the island-nation.</p>
      <p>Congratulatory messages are being exchanged over social media, celebrating the results of the elections last week in far-off <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mauritius">Mauritius.</a></p>
      <p>Incumbent Jugnauth took oath on Tuesday after the elections which consolidated the grip of his Morisian Alliance on parliament.</p>
      <p>Rasra's sub divisional magistrate Vipin Kumar Jain said it has been established that Jugnauth's ancestors hailed from the area, but the exact village is yet to be pinpointed.</p>
      <p>"Four people in Rasra have claimed that he belongs to their family," the SDM said.</p>
      <p>Rasra MLA Uma Shankar Singh expressed happiness over Jugnauth's success and said people in the area are proud of his achievements.</p>
      <p>"The central and state governments should make all-out efforts to find Jugnauth's village, he said, accusing them of not doing enough.</p>
      <p>Jugnauth, 57, took over from his father in 2017 without going through a vote, but his centre-right coalition scored a decisive in the November 7 elections.</p>
      <p>Months ago, a diplomat from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/mauritius">Mauritius </a>visited Rasra, reportedly in a bid to trace Jugnauth's ancestors.</p>
      <p>Indian-origin people constitute nearly 70 per cent of the population of Mauritius. Their ancestors were sent there as indentured labourers during the British rule.</p>
