      <p>Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra and her Jonas Brother husband Nick Jonas are living it up in the real estate market as they buy their luxurious home together.</p>
      <p>The star duo reportedly shelled out $20 million for a 20,000-square-foot property in Los Angeles, confirmed <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i> And it seems like it runs in the family. Nick’s brother and band mate Joe and his <i>Game of Thrones</i> star wife Sophie Turner spent $14.1 million for a 15,000-square-foot home just three miles away.</p>
      <p>The Jonas Brothers are reportedly breaking real estate records in Encino, having spent a combined $34.1 million in the Los Angeles neighbourhood.</p>
