      <h1>Christopher Jullien on colossal Celtic display against Lazio as he shows Olivier Ntcham love</h1>
      <h2>The French defender has a week to rest over the international break but still dreams of playing for France one day.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Christopher Jullien admits it’s a bit lonely around Lennoxtown this week with so many of his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> chums jetting off around the world on international duty.</p>
      <p>The big Frenchman knows the upside of a few extra days with his feet up while they plough away with their countries but the Hoops ace would much rather be at the international coal face than in front of the box.</p>
      <p>But Jullien is aware his home nation of France are not exactly struggling for centre-backs right now.</p>
      <p>The likes of PSG superstar Raphael Varane and Barcelona’s Samuel Umtiti are not too shabby and neither are <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>’s Aymeric Laporte or Bayern Munich’s Benjamin Pavard.</p>
      <p>Oh, then there’s Kurt Zouma at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a>, Clement Lenglet at the Nou Camp and Bayern’s Lucas Hernandez who does a stint in that position.</p>
      <p>Piece of cake getting past that lot.</p>
      <p>Jullien admits it’s a tall order but the enforced time off can allow a man to dream.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old said: “I was a little bit used to it before this year. After playing for the young team in France, I knew the international break was a time to focus on myself and the things I need to work on.</p>
      <p>“It’s really quiet in Lennoxtown with not many players around and I’m happy there are so many international players here.</p>
      <p>“I have some more days off but I would love to cut those days off to become an international player. It’s my dream to be an international player.</p>
      <p>“When you touch it a little bit when you are young and you see others you have played with going on to represent France, it’s unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“As I say, it’s a dream but I know I am far from it just now because there are so many good players. But who does not dream of playing for their country?”</p>
      <p>It’s a heck of a jump from Celtic to the World Cup winners but it wasn’t so much of a leap for Dedryck Boyata to make the Belgium squad for Russia last year.</p>
      <p>Jullien is also no stranger to the international set-up as he was part of the France squad who won the FIFA Under 20 World Cup six years ago.</p>

      <p>He had the likes of Paul Pogba as a team-mate back then and watched several more of the class of 2013 make the step up.</p>
      <p>The big defender is delighted for his old pals but there is a hint of jealousy.</p>
      <p>Jullien said: “I won the Under-20 World Cup with France and it was the first trophy of my career. It was just unbelievable playing in that team.</p>
      <p>“Eight of the first 11 have played for the full national team. I’m really happy they made the French team but in my head I am disappointed in myself because I know I could do it. The step up is high but I will keep working.”</p>
      <p>Jullien can always send the French Football Federation footage of his performance in the Stadio Olimpico last week.</p>
      <p>Celtic gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> summed it up on one of the few quieter moments in Rome when he turned the questions on the press pack.</p>
      <p>He asked: “What about big Jullien? Wow.”</p>
      <p>Everyone knew what he meant.</p>
      <p>The centre-back had a rough start at Parkhead but looked every inch the £7million player and more in a colossal display in the sensational victory against Lazio in the Eternal City.</p>

      <p>Jullien said: “You don’t have that kind of game every week but it was really good. I’m just trying to keep the momentum going.</p>
      <p>“All my team-mates are good with me and I will just try to do my best to help the team.</p>
      <p>“It was not easy to come into a team that wins everything. It’s really difficult but I’m just trying to do my best every day then you never know what will happen in football.</p>
      <p>“In football, it all happens so fast. I’m just trying to remain focused.</p>
      <p>“Who knows? If you have the number of the national trainer in France and you want to call him about me there’s no problem!</p>
      <p>“It would be a dream but there are so many good players in that team – that’s why they won the World Cup.”</p>
      <p>Jullien can dream but he won’t lose any sleep over the France situation any time soon. He’s enjoying life at Celtic and he’s thrilled the club are firing on all cylinders.</p>

      <p>The former Toulouse star is a major presence in the dressing room already but he confessed there was added satisfaction when it came to the Parkhead side’s Roman hero.</p>
      <p>It has been a tricky time for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/olivier-ntcham">Olivier Ntcham</a> this term, with transfer talk, injuries and lack of game time due to the performances of Scott Brown, Callum McGregor and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-christie">Ryan Christie</a>.</p>
      <p>Jullien is delighted to see his pal getting a bit of love right now.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “It was good, I was really happy for him. He’s had some problems this season so I’m really happy.</p>
      <p>“Since I arrived here he has stayed with me as a friend and has made me feel better on the field. We all know his talent so I’m not afraid for him.</p>
      <p>“The fact he has been in and out of the team says a lot about our squad. When you have quality like that, <br/>sometimes you won’t be playing every game. We are all together though.”</p>
