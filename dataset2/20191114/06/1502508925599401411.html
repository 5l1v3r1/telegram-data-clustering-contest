      <p>After an unsuccessful bid two months ago, India may attempt another soft landing on the Moon by next year-end, probably in November, sources in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/isro">ISRO </a>said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation had constituted a high-level committee, headed by S Somanath, Director of Thiruvanathapuram-based Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, the lead centre responsible for all launch vehicle programmes of ISRO, to prepare a report on the proposed Chandrayaan-3.</p>
      <p>"The panel's report is awaited. The committee has been given a guideline to prepare the mission before the end of next year," a senior <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/isro">ISRO </a>official told PTI.</p>
      <p>"There is a good launch window in November".</p>
      <p>"Rover, lander and landing operations will get more focus this time and whatever deficiencies in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-chandrayaan-2">Chandrayaan-2 </a>mission will be corrected," sources in the Bengaluru- headquartered space agency said.</p>
      <p>On September 7, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/isro">Isro </a>attempted a soft landing of Chandrayaan-2's 'Vikram' on the unchartered lunar south pole, before losing communication with the lander.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>level committee consisting of academics and ISRO experts, headed by V Narayanan, Director of the space agency's Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, has analysed the cause of communication loss with the lander.</p>
      <p>The members of the panel included those from VSSC and U R Rao Satellite Centre.</p>
      <p>"This committee has pin-pointed as to what went wrong. They have prepared a voluminous report and are believed to have submitted it to the Space Commission," an ISRO official said.</p>
      <p>"It's expected to be put in the public domain after the approval of the PMO," the official said.</p>
