      <h1>Kristen Stewart can’t wait for Robert Pattinson to say ‘I’m Batman’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:09:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>In a recent interview with <i>Fandango</i>, Kristen Stewart showered Robert Pattinson with love. Joined by her <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> co-stars Naomi Scott and Ella Balinksa, the trio was asked to list their favorite caped crusaders and Kristen had the sweetest response.</p>
      <p>“Robert Pattinson yet to find out,” she answered, which was met with applause from her fellow Angels. “I have all the faith.”</p>
      <p>According to <i>E! News, </i>after a quick fan girl session over Robert and Zoë Kravitz, who will be playing Catwoman in the upcoming flick, Kristen gushed over her talented former boyfriend. “I cannot wait to see that,” she raved. “I’ve known those guys for a long time, obviously.”</p>

      <p>So, who is Kristen’s runner-up for the best Batman? She said Michael Keaton is her second favorite. “I mean, for me, like Michael Keaton is definitely the one,” she added. “It’s really fun to watch Michael Keaton be like, ‘Hey.’ I can’t wait to hear Rob be like ‘I’m Batman.'”</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that <i>Café Society</i> star has weighed in on Robert playing the iconic comic book hero. Back in May, Kristen said that he’s the best person for the role.</p>
      <p>“Oh man, I feel like he’s the only guy that could play that part,” she told <i>Variety</i>. “I am so happy for him, it’s crazy. It just feels like, I dunno. I’m very, very happy about that. I heard that and I was like, ‘Oh man!’ Yeah, yeah, it’s awesome.”</p>
      <p>Kristen and Robert dated for three years while playing couple Bella and Edward in the <i>Twilight </i>films. The duo broke up in 2013, but according to Kristen, they would’ve gotten married if they had stayed together.</p>
