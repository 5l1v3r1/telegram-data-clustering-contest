      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/bitcoin-btc-price-sighting-downside-thrust-before-higher/">couple of bearish patterns</a> for bitcoin below the $8,880 resistance against the US Dollar. BTC remained in a bearish zone below the $8,800 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>The last rejection was near the $8,780 level and the 100 hourly SMA. A high was formed near $8,784 before the price declined below $8,700. Moreover, the price traded below $8,680 and it is currently testing the $8,640 support area.</p>
      <p>If there is an upside correction, the $8,710 level is an immediate resistance. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,784 high to $8,636 low is also near the $8,710 level.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/bitcoin-btc-price-eyeing-fresh-monthly-low-below-8-5k/">main resistances on the upside</a> are near the $8,740 and $8,750 levels. More importantly, there is a short term breakout pattern forming with resistance near $8,740 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>An intermediate resistance is near the $8,730 level. It represents the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,784 high to $8,636 low. Therefore, bitcoin price might struggle to break the $8,730-$8,750 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, BTC needs to climb above the key $8,800 and $8,880 resistance levels to move into a positive zone and start a decent recovery. The next resistance is near $9,000, followed by $9,250.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price might continue to move down if it fails to climb above $8,780, $8,800 and $8,880. An initial support is near the $8,640 level. The next key support is near the $8,600 level, below which the price is likely to accelerate lower towards the $8,500 and $8,300 support area.</p>
