      <h2>EK West Councillor David Watson says he and fellow elected representatives weren’t informed of important changes to proposals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>An Independent councillor has slammed South Lanarkshire Council for not consulting with elected members over plans for the controversial dualling of Stewartfield Way.</p>
      <p>The local authority have launched a public consultation which will run until December 20 into the £62millon.</p>
      <p>But East Kilbride West Councillor David Watson says he and fellow elected representatives weren’t informed of important changes to proposals before they were made public and have been unable to answer constituents’ questions as a result.</p>
      <p>He told the News: “South Lanarkshire Council has issued publicity about the plans before passing details to local councillors – despite requests for information.</p>
      <p>“From what I can see so far is that plans do not tie in with the original proposals as it excludes the flyover at Kingsgate, keeping all the roundabouts and adding a new one at Playsport.</p>
      <p>“I am not sure how this will improve traffic flow entering and leaving East Kilbride.”</p>
      <p>He went on: “The Council appear to be dressing this up by claiming to add environmental incentives such as a cycle path, walk way and claiming to make it bus friendly.</p>
      <p>“But at the same time destroying the ambiance and environment surrounding the James Hamilton Heritage Loch and the full length of Stewartfield Way.</p>
      <p>“If proposals were genuine a cycle path and walk way could be added at any time, without disruption to the area and the dualling.”</p>

      <p>And he said claims of making the route ‘bus friendly’ will “make residents laugh” as the bus service in Stewartfield is “next to non-existent” as bus companies have shown no interest in developing a service in the area.</p>
      <p>Councillor Watson added that he hoped to get more information this week after a briefing session.</p>
      <p>Gordon Mackay, head of roads and transportation at South Lanarkshire Council, said the council’s “extensive consultation” hopes to ensure as many people as possible are given the opportunity to comment on Stewartfield Way.</p>
      <p>He added: “Some information has already been released online, with elected members being contacted directly as well as being further briefed at an event later this week.</p>
      <p>“At that point, further information will be made available online and interested parties will be given an opportunity to offer comment and raise any concerns.</p>
      <p>“The proposals are at an early stage and the purpose of the consultation exercise is to gauge public opinion prior to committing investment in further detailed preparatory work. Any matters or concerns raised will be considered following the close of the consultation and will inform the decision regarding the next steps for the project.”</p>
      <h3>You can have your say on Stewartfield Way</h3>
      <p>The public consultation has now begun for the £62million plans to upgrade Stewartfield Way.</p>
      <p>A key part of Central Scotland’s road network, views on the plans to dual the road are being sought from residents in East Kilbride and the 23,000 motorists who use the carriageway each day.</p>
      <p>Part of the business proposal for the scheme was an estimation of the worth to the local area if the project were to get the go-ahead.</p>
      <p>Financial experts KPMG undertook research into the matter, estimating the project could be worth around £570m to the East Kilbride area. However, there are a number of opponents to the proposals who say the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.</p>
      <p>Completion of the project is expected to take up to three years, with many branding the £62million proposals a “massive waste of money”.</p>
      <p>The plans are part of the wider Glasgow Region City Deal, with eight local authorities having their say on where the money is spent.</p>
      <p>The single-carriage way road is seen as a “missing link” in the wider road network which connects the city region through major roads including the M74, the M8, M77 and the East Kilbride Expressway.</p>

      <p>In addition, views will be welcomed via an online questionnaire, or by writing to South Lanarkshire Council.</p>
      <p>Those should be sent to: South Lanarkshire Council, Roads and Transportation Services, Montrose House, 154 Montrose Crescent, Hamilton, ML3 6LB,</p>
      <p>Views can also be emailed to roadsandtransportation@southlanarkshire.gov.uk</p>
      <p>The consultation will close on December 20 with results expected to be available in the first quarter of the New Year.</p>
