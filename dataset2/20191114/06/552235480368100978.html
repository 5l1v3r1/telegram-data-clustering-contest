      <h2>Nathan McNaughton is heading to Lesbos after being held at knifepoint in Columbia.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tara Fitzpatrick</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire">Kilmarnock</a> photography student is heading to a Greek island to support refugee camps housing those fleeing conflict.</p>
      <p>Nathan McNaughton will work with the charity Refugees 4 Refugees who provide lifesaving help to those living in the camps on Lesvos — also known as Lesbos — at the forefront of the humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p>Nathan, 21, has travelled across the world for photography projects from Colombia to Nepal in the past and has decided to use his time building a portfolio of work as a way to support the organisation.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I asked them if I could come and document their work and they said yes but I also want to volunteer,” Nathan told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock Standard</a>.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to just take images. I want to make sure I am actually helping.”</p>
      <p>Nathan, who currently studies at the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, will depart for the island on Saturday, November 23 where he will spend two weeks volunteering — and will celebrate his 22nd birthday in the camps.</p>
      <p>Sea arrivals to the Greek Island reception centres in September rose to more than 10,000 — the highest monthly level since 2016.</p>
      <p>Many refugees are on journeys to Europe, predominantly from Syrian and Afghan territories while many are unaccompanied children.</p>
      <p>Residents of Lesvos were nominated in 2016 for the Nobel Peace Prize for their dedication to saving thousands of refugees who arrived, often penniless, on the shores of the island in 2015.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking about his expectations for his arrival at the camps, Nathan said: “It’s something I have previously been interested in. I want to be exposed to the reality of refugee life.</p>
      <p>“This will put me right on the frontline of the crisis. I’m a wee bit nervous but I’m ready to get to work.</p>
      <p>“I will be volunteering up to 12 hours a day and be on call for whatever happens.”</p>
      <p>Refugees 4 Refugees is a non-political organisation supporting refugees and also creating environments for other asylum seekers to get directly involved in relief efforts.</p>
      <p>It was founded by Omar Alshakal — who arrived in Europe in 2014 after swimming for 14 hours from Turkey to Greece — after he experienced the weaknesses and flaws in the asylum process firsthand.</p>
      <p>While this will be Nathan’s first experience at a refugee camp, the student says he is prepared for what lies ahead.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I have had a few experiences which have helped me prepare for challenging situations,” he said.</p>
      <p>“When I was in Colombia, I was robbed which was quite scary.”</p>
      <p>In 2017, Nathan was forced to launch a crowdfunding campaign after he was held up at knifepoint in the South American country.</p>
      <p>At the time of the incident, he had been volunteering at a school in one of the most impoverished parts of the country Santa Marta.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On his way home from his travels, his precious kit — worth more than £5000 — was stolen when he was mugged by four men in the capital city Bogotá.</p>
      <p>Despite these terrifying experiences, Nathan says he is still motivated to work as a photographer across the world.</p>
      <p>“My desire to travel is stronger as a result. It has been a reality check for me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Things like this can happen and it’s all about how to tackle these situations.”</p>
