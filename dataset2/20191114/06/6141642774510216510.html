      <p>McDonald’s is to trial collection bins for unwanted plastic toys to be recycled into new products such as coffee cups and play equipment.</p>
      <p>The fast food giant will collect any plastic toys – from its own Happy Meals and those bought from other retailers – as long as they fit through the 17cm diameter entrance to the bins.</p>
      <p>The initial trial will run for four weeks in seven restaurants in the UK and Ireland: Bramley Road, St Ives, East Kilbride – Queensway Drive Thru, Kingston, Milton Keynes, Cherry Tree Road, Blackpool, Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff, Roscrea, Ireland, and The Swan Centre, Eastleigh.</p>

      <p>Helen McFarlane, sustainability manager at McDonald’s UK &amp; Ireland, said: “It is really important we test this to ascertain what customers bring back to us and in turn what we are able to create with the old plastic toys.</p>
      <p>“We want to ensure we’re creating genuinely useful products from the toys children have enjoyed and finished playing with. This test will enable us to work with our suppliers to create a range of new items, maximising the amount of plastic we can recycle and reducing the need for the creation of new virgin plastic.”</p>
      <p>If successful, McDonald’s will look to roll the move out to all restaurants in 2020.</p>
      <p>The trial follows McDonald’s announcing it will give customers the option of swapping plastic toys in its Happy Meals for fruit bags or books.</p>
      <p>The announcements follow increasing consumer pressure on fast food chains to stop handing out the single-use plastic toys, which parents commonly complain are promptly discarded and only contribute to the waste crisis.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s said swapping out the toys, alongside its roll-out of paper straws in restaurants, the removal of McFlurry plastic lids and the removal of single-use plastic from McDonald’s salads, would reduce waste by 1,005 metric tonnes annually.</p>
