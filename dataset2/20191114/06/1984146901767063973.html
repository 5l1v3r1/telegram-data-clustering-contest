      <p>A nurse who left her friend's leg crushed when she agreed to give a drunk driving lesson to a teenage girl on a glamping trip has been allowed to keep her job.</p>
      <p>Leanne McGough was enjoying a birthday trip in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> when she said she would give her friend’s 16-year-old daughter an impromptu lesson after a BBQ and drinks, "because it was on private land".</p>
      <p>But when she swapped seats with the teenager to let her sit in the driving seat, a disciplinary panel heard <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a> nurse McGough left the car in reverse gear.</p>
      <p>When the young girl pressed on the accelerator the vehicle went back and ploughed into two people.</p>
      <p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard that one of those people was uninjured but <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/leanne-mcgough-sunderland-nurse-crash-17107435">the other, Natalie Cave, was pinned to the ground</a> as the car ran over her leg.</p>
      <p>The report said: "She sustained a broken ankle, severe ligament and nerve damage, and she ultimately required three operations, with treatment ongoing in respect of the injuries.</p>
      <p>"They required such intervention as an artery transplant from her arm to the injured leg, and a skin graft. There was also a fractured rib and burns from the fire-pit to her foot."</p>
      <p>The panel also heard that when the police attended, the teenager's mother told officers she had been driving rather than her daughter.</p>
      <p>She and McGough "maintained this dishonest account in police interviews" but told the truth the following morning.</p>
      <p>The NMC's report said that in April this year McGough was sentenced at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> to 21 months in prison, suspended for two years, after previously pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.</p>

      <p>Now the disciplinary panel has ruled that McGough, who at the time was a junior sister at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland's Royal Hospital,</a> can keep her job but will be subject to a caution order for the next five years.</p>
      <p>The report included the judge's sentencing remarks of, "Amongst the 30 powerful references and letters of support I have read are numerous references from managers, consultant geriatricians, and other colleagues, who describe you as a dedicated, professional, caring, considerate and responsible nurse.</p>
      <p>"Given all I have read about your commitment and abilities as a nurse, it would be plainly a significant loss both to Sunderland Hospital and nursing more widely if you didn’t keep your job in the long-term.”</p>
      <p>A statement from McGough said: "I know what I have done is completely wrong and is completely out of character. I have been in shock and am very ashamed and remorseful for what I have done.</p>

      <p>"There was no malice or intent to cause harm or injury on that day, and what has happened will remain with me forever."</p>
      <p>The panel said: "The aggravating features include: that the Registrant was inebriated and she exercised poor judgement in deciding to give a 16-year-old, who had also consumed alcohol and was described as ‘extremely drunk’, driving lessons.</p>
      <p>"The mitigating features in this case include: the Registrant has practised for 17 years with an otherwise unblemished career record. The regulatory concern relates to one incident outside of work and is unrelated to the Registrant’s clinical practice.</p>
      <p>"The parties agree that a caution order is the appropriate sanction. There is no risk to the public or patients which requires the Registrant’s practice to be restricted.</p>
      <p>"Indeed, in light of the many positive references attesting to the Registrant’s skill as a clinical practitioner, there is a public interest in permitting a good nurse to continue to practise. This order nonetheless marks that the Registrant’s behaviour was unacceptable and must never happen again.</p>
      <p>"For the next five years Miss Mcgough’s employer or any prospective employer will be on notice that her fitness to practise has been found to be impaired and that her practice is subject to a restriction."</p>
