      <h1>AUS vs PAK | Cameron Bancroft, Joe Burns in the squad for Test series, Usman Khawaja left out</h1>

        <b>Cameron Bancroft and Joe Burns have been named in Australia's 14-man squad for the upcoming two-match Test series against Pakistan, while Usman Khawaja has been left out. Meanwhile, batsmen Will Pucovksi and Nic Maddinson weren’t considered as they opted out citing mental health issues.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Besides Khawaja, opener Marcus Harris and Peter Siddle — who all featured in the 17-man Ashes squad earlier this year — did not find a place in the squad for Pakistan series. Bancroft, who was dropped after the first two Tests in England, was picked a backup option in the middle-order in Maddinson’s absence. Batting at No.6 during Australia A’s practice match against Pakistan, Bancroft made a gutsy 49 despite his team being bundled out for just 122.</p>
      <p>Travis Head, who was dropped for the final Ashes Test, returns to the side as co vice-captain on the back of a superlative century for South Australia against New South Wales last week. National selector Trevor Hohns also picked the in-form Matthew Wade to complete the middle-order.</p>
      <p>"Travis Head scored a hundred against a very good New South Wales attack just a few weeks ago and also offers the option of part-time off-spin. Matthew Wade was superb as a specialist batsman through last summer, had a solid Ashes Series with two hundreds and a strong start to the current domestic season," Hohns said, reported Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>"We anticipate Matthew and Travis will give us a strong middle order in support of the top four. Cameron Bancroft is someone who has the ingredients of what we believe makes a good Test cricketer and rounds out our batting group in the squad," he said.</p>
      <p>The top four was probably the easiest to pick for the selectors with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/david_warner">David Warner</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steve_smith">Steve Smith</a>, and Marnus Labuschagne being automatic picks given their recent performances. Warner is likely to be reunited with Joe Burns, who narrowly missed out on the Ashes squad, at the top.</p>
      <p>"David Warner and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steven_smith">Steven Smith</a> are in magical touch. We also welcome Joe Burns into the squad who we feel was unlucky to miss the Ashes squad. Joe's record speaks for itself, he has Test hundreds on the board and has combined very well with David (Warner) in the past. We also like the feel of a right-hand, left-hand combination at the top of the order. Marnus' performances in England and at the start of this season demanded his selection," Hohns said.</p>
      <p>While Nathan Lyon continues to be the lone spinner in the squad, Michael Neser has been picked ahead of the experienced Siddle.</p>
      <p>"We are blessed to have four of the best fast bowlers in the world challenging each other for spots and most importantly playing as a group. Cummins, Starc, Hazelwood and Pattinson are daunting pace prospects for any opposition, particularly at home. Michael Neser adds to that group with his ability to move the ball both ways, giving the team another bowling option depending on the conditions," Hohns added. </p>
