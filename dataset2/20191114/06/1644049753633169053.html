      <h1>Hong Kong’s pride parade downgraded to ‘public meeting’ as protests swirl</h1>

      <p>Police have downgraded Hong Kong’s annual gay pride parade to a stationary rally, organisers said Thursday, after police banned the traditionally boisterous and colourful march through the territory as pro-democracy protests engulf the city.</p>
      <p>Police allowed the Saturday afternoon event on condition it takes the “form of a public meeting” and not a march, Hong Kong Pride Parade said in a statement on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The event will be held across the afternoon at a public square on Hong Kong island.</p>
      <p>The move comes with violence spiking as protests enter a sixth month, with protesters bringing much of Hong Kong to a standstill since Monday.</p>
      <p>Prominent LGBT lawmaker Ray Chan decried the ban on the parade through the city’s commercial heart — the key element to a global tradition celebrating equality.</p>
      <p>“The pride parade has always been orderly, peaceful and well-disciplined,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There is no reason for the police to reject the pride parade application… It has nothing to do with the recent protests.”</p>
      <p>The event has previously been held in a carnival-like atmosphere with members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and supporters parading through the city centre.</p>
      <p>Foreign embassy officials, tourists and city’s lawmakers have participated in parades in recent years in an Asian city renowned for its relatively progressive values.</p>
      <p>The parade is the latest casualty in a growing list of banned, cancelled or postponed events in Hong Kong’s normally packed social calendar.</p>
      <p>The WTA Hong Kong Open, Oxfam’s annual trail run fundraiser as well as concerts by acclaimed K-Pop acts and comedians have been pulled as the city reels from the protests.</p>
      <p>Organisers of others such as music festival Clockenflap, which starts next Friday, have vowed to press ahead despite the political crisis.</p>
