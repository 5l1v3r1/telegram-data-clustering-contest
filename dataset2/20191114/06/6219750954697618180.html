      <p>Designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill LLP (SOM) with local architecture partner <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/may-architecture">May Architecture</a>, the new Winship at Midtown facility for cancer care is an addition to the Emory University <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/hospital">Hospital</a> Midtown (EUHM) campus and the existing Winship Cancer Institute.</p>

      <p>450,000 square feet of inpatient, outpatient, and research facilities, will facilitate access to cancer services in the city of <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/atlanta">Atlanta</a>, the state of <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/georgia">Georgia</a>, and beyond. Scheduled for 2023, the building will enhance the facilities provided by the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the state of Georgia.</p>
      <blockquote><i>We are so honored to have been selected to design this new addition for one of America’s leading cancer treatment and research programs. […] This project is a fantastic opportunity to work with Winship Cancer Institute on building a next-generation facility for finding cures and improving lives.</i> -- Mustafa Abadan, FAIA, Design Partner in <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/som">SOM</a>’s New York office.</blockquote>

      <p>Located at the intersection of Linden Avenue and Peachtree Street, on the EUHM campus, the building will “<i>house comprehensive oncology facilities including inpatient beds, surgical capacity, infusion treatment, outpatient clinics, diagnostic imaging, linear accelerators, and areas for wellness, rehabilitation, and clinical research</i>”. Moreover, a two-story of “<i>care communities</i>” will dictate the exterior façade and will be at the core of the building’s conceptual design.</p>

      <blockquote><i>The new Winship at Midtown facility will provide state-of-the-art, innovative cancer care in a magnificent building designed to treat patients in a unique patient-centered setting. […] We know our patients, family members, faculty and staff will benefit greatly from this new building that will change the skyline of Atlanta.</i> -- Daniel Owens, CEO of Emory University <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/hospital">Hospital</a> Midtown.</blockquote>
      <p>With an approachable scale, on <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/atlanta">Atlanta</a>’s iconic Peachtree Street, the structure meets the public realm with a transparent storefront, a welcoming lobby, and retail, integrating the health facility with the city, and “<i>reconsidering how an urban medical center relates to its neighborhood</i>”. The new facility will include many sustainable design features like high-performance façade, water efficiency, and stormwater management. Daylight, views, and thermal comfort support patients’ recovery. Aiming for LEED Silver and a 130 Energy Use Intensity (EUI), the building will consume 40% less energy annually than the average hospital in Atlanta.</p>
      <blockquote><i>The potential impact of this project is enormous. […] Together with Emory, we are reinventing healthcare and creating a breakthrough project that defines the future of cancer care hospitals and research centers.</i> -- Anthony Treu, AIA, ACHA, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/som">SOM</a> Firmwide <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/healthcare">Healthcare</a> Leader</blockquote>
