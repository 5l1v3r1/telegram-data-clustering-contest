I hope to create a Story-driven Adventure Puzzle game and I will be using Blender for a lot of the Asset Creation and for those who enjoy speed modelling videos might enjoy this.<br/><br/>If you would like to watch the process of me making a game you can check out the playlist (link below).<br/><br/>The Battery Mesh is super simple to create and I am pleased with the result, If you would like to download the .blend, you can find the link in our blog.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this video and as always, thanks for reading!..</blockquote>
