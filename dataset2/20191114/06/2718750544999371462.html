      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/chance-the-rapper-the-big-day-album-review.html">Chance the Rapper</a> truly can’t conceive of a world where someone wouldn’t like him. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/billie-eilish-new-song-everything-i-wanted.html">Billie Eilish</a> doesn’t seem to care that people think she gets her clothes from a lost-and-found bin, which is very on brand for her. Tré Cool from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/green-day-weezer-fall-out-boy-hella-mega-tour-new-music.html">Green Day</a> does, in fact, kind of look like Ted Cruz’s steampunk younger brother. These are just a few of the revelations that the newest music edition of Jimmy Kimmel’s schadenfreude-inducing “Mean Tweets” series has wrought. While some of the musicians, like <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/the-10-best-country-albums-of-2017.html">Luke Combs</a>, conceded to their haters, others, like <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/lizzo-truth-hurts-plagiarism-that-bitch.html">Lizzo</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/cardi-b-cast-in-fast-and-furious-9.html">Cardi B</a>, were ready to fight back. Don’t get it twisted — the <i>only</i> bus Lizzo is riding is a tour bus (straight to the bank, babe!) and you can “suck [Cardi B’s] ass” if you think she “looks loud.”</p>
