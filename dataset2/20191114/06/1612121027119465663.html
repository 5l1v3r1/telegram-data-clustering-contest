      <p>Encryption can be one of those terms that just sounds like a magic buzzword. You want your stuff to be encrypted, but what exactly does that mean? How can you tell that it’s encrypted? With a lot of devices, you can’t; it’s mysterious and difficult to manage.</p>
      <p>NordVPN, despite having a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345475-nordvpn-compromised/">recent security scare</a>, wants to tackle this problem with their new NordLocker service. The program is a security tool that allows you to securely encrypt your files and information without needing to deal with any overly complex programs.</p>
      <h3>Encrypt all the things</h3>
      <p>Despite the name, NordLocker isn’t a cloud storage service. It can be used on your cloud files, if you want, but the purpose of NordLocker is to make it easy to take your files wherever they are and get them encrypted and away from danger and prying eyes. It’s end-to-end encrypted as well, which is a huge plus for securely handling your encryption keys and not letting any other company manage them for you.</p>
      <p>It utilizes modern and difficult-to-crack cryptography, so you can feel safe with NordLocker handling your files. You also have control over who can look at them, so you can encrypt something, email it, and specifically only give that person access to the files.</p>
      <p>It’s currently only available for MacOS and Windows, but hopefully mobile apps follow suit shortly.</p>
