      <p>The Montblanc Summit 2 was one of the first <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346167-fossil-hybrid-hr-smartwatch/">Wear OS</a> smartwatches to utilize <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/332465-qualcomms-snapdragon-wear-3100-platform-brings-extended-battery-life-and-added-complications/">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 3100</a> platform, and since we haven’t officially had a replacement yet, that still makes it a compelling option for someone looking for a smartwatch that can still blend in with nicer jewelry.</p>
      <p>But a year later, Montblanc wants to up their game with their already-successful watch. The Summit 2+ has stopped by the FCC and looks to offer a key upgrade, and something that’s pretty rare for <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342740-samsung-galaxy-watch-active2/">Wear OS watches</a>.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, most of the hardware is unknown, so we’re not sure if this is going to be using the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345730-qualcomm-snapdragon-3300-leak/">upcoming Wear 3300 platform</a>. But we do know that the FCC filing has confirmed that the Summit 2+ will be a connected LTE watch, and it’ll have bands to ensure that it works on Verizon, too. It still packs in Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC, but the battery is taking a small hit and going down to just 300mAh from 340mAh on the original Summit 2.</p>
      <p>Fingers crossed that it does have an upgraded processor so that LTE connectivity doesn’t create the shortest battery life to ever exist on a smartwatch.</p>
