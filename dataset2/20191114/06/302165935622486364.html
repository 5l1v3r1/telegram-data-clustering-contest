      <p>SHANGHAI, Nov 14 — A harrowing drama about school bullying has struck a strong personal chord with Chinese cinema audiences and soared to the top of the box office, after authorities belatedly gave it the go-ahead.</p>
      <p><i>Better Days</i> shines a spotlight on what the state-run <i>China Daily</i> called “a nationwide problem which has existed for years” but is rarely broached in Chinese films.</p>
      <p>A real-life case went viral this week about a seven-year-old girl who needed hospital treatment after a group of fellow pupils forced scraps of paper into her eyes.</p>
      <p><i>Better Days</i> has grossed at least ¥1.4 billion (RM831 million) in the nearly three weeks since its release, according to the China Movie Data Information Network.</p>
      <p>Starring Zhou Dongyu and Jackson Yee, two popular figures in Chinese cinema, the film is based on a novel and tells the story of a teenage girl who teams up with a school drop-out to protect her from bullies.</p>
      <p>The girl’s plight has left cinema-goers deeply moved, with many people commenting online that they had been reduced to tears. For a few, the film is a reminder of a past they would rather forget.</p>
      <p>The film also highlights the pressures of the “gaokao”, the notorious examination for Chinese universities.</p>
      <p>China’s communist authorities appear to have only very reluctantly allowed the film by Hong Kong director Derek Tsang to show because of the sensitivity of the subject.</p>
      <p>In February it was abruptly pulled without explanation from the Berlin Film Festival days before it was to be screened.</p>
      <p>It also failed to come out as scheduled in June in China’s heavily vetted cinemas, before finally being released in the world’s most populous country on October 25.</p>
      <p>Many Chinese have speculated online that it was only green-lighted after cuts were made. The film was released overseas last week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Bully or be bullied’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Global Times</i>, one of the ruling Communist Party’s mouthpieces, cited a survey that found more than 32 per cent of Chinese primary and middle-school pupils have been bullied.</p>
      <p>Six per cent were frequently bullied, it said, which given China’s vast population means tens of millions of young children.</p>
      <p>“When you were a kid, you bullied others or were bullied by others, right?” says a policeman in the film, summing up the scale of the problem.</p>
      <p>Cinema-goers are left in no doubt that the government is taking bullying seriously with public-service announcements before and after the film.</p>
      <p>One message details the steps the government is taking, such as the launch last year of a major anti-bullying campaign in primary and middle schools.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, a law professor writing in the <i>China Daily</i> said that the film “has sparked a public debate on school bullying”.</p>
      <p>Qiao Xinsheng, of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, said that a meeting last month of China’s rubber-stamp legislature made clear that bullying is a top priority.</p>
      <p>Psychological counselling of bullies is one prime way to stop them, argued Qiao, while also calling for security guards in schools.</p>
      <p>The age of criminal responsibility should be lowered from 16 to 12 for the worst offences, said Qiao.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Slapped, humiliated</b>
      </p>
      <p>The girl in <i>Better Days</i> seeks help from the school but its weak measures are ineffective and only makes the bullying worse.</p>
      <p>That was the bitter experience of Huang Hui, a 26-year-old journalist in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>As a young teenager, Huang was targeted after she moved from a village to a town boarding school in the central province of Hubei.</p>
      <p>Some of her class-mates thought her inferior because of her rural background.</p>
      <p>One of her teachers also took a disliking to her and accused her of gossiping about him.</p>
      <p>“He slapped my face and pulled me by the hair into a wall,” said Huang.</p>
      <p>“Then I had to get on my knees in front of the dormitory for the whole night while everyone walked past. It was humiliating.”</p>
      <p>The bullies then accused her of spilling secrets about them. They beat her up.</p>
      <p>“The torture made me feel it was like a prison or hell,” Huang said, calling bullying in schools “very common”.</p>
      <p>A younger brother was also a victim.</p>
      <p>With her father working in another city — the case for many millions of children in rural China — Huang took matters into her own hands.</p>
      <p>“The law of the jungle, that the weak are the prey of the strong, pushed me to grow powerful in high school,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I became a member of a school gang, able to stand up to whoever I didn’t like.” — AFP</p>
