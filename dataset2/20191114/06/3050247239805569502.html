      <h1>Patrick Ngan Teases Asia’s First Unified Crypto–Fiat Payment System</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Love</a></address>
      <p>Speaking on stage at BlockShow 2019 in Singapore today, Alchemy Global Payment Solutions co-founder Patrick Ngan discussed some details of how his company is making it easier to pay for everyday goods and services with cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Ngan emphasized the power of choice to make consumers and merchants happier. Calling his company “the first unified crypto-fiat payment solution in Asia,” he described a merchant product that lets the customer decide whether they want to pay in the local fiat currency or a popular cryptocurrency of their choice.</p>
      <p>“People in this audience probably have a lot of Bitcoin,” Ngan said. “Instead of trading that currency, we can give you the chance to freely spend it on that expensive bottle of Dom Perignon, or a fancy handbag.”</p>
      <p>The Alchemy GPS merchant app is already available for download from Google Play and the App Store. It supports a number of payment systems popular throughout Asia, including Alipay, WeChat Pay, PayNow and Rakuten Pay, as well as major cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>Businesses have the choice of how they want to settle their accounts — if they can tolerate the volatility, then it’s no problem for them to be paid in crypto. But Alchemy GPS can also support fiat settlements for more conventional bookkeeping.</p>
      <p>Ngan explained that the ultimate goal here is to drive cryptocurrency adoption, saying: “We want to enable all the popular crypto tokens out there to be accepted by our merchant system. Anyone who buys tokens should be able to easily spend them.”</p>
      <p>Alchemy GPS is already up and running in Singapore and Hong Kong — so, if you’re attending BlockShow, then you can pay for local cab rides with crypto today.</p>
      <p>Ngan ended his presentation by announcing plans to expand into other crypto-friendly countries. He named Japan, Korea and Thailand specifically, with later plans to enter the United Arab Emirates and the United States.</p>
