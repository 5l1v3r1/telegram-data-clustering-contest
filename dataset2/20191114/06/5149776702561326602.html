      <h1>More waterside apartments and homes earmarked for banks of the River Trent</h1>
      <h2>The proposed development marks the second phase of the vast project</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>The multi-million-pound transformation of the city's waterside could be boosted further with plans in the pipeline to build more apartments and homes on the banks of the River Trent.</p>
      <p>Plans have been submitted to revamp the former Merrill Brown sign-making site to the east of Trent Lane, between <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Nottingham</a> and Colwick.</p>
      <p>A five-storey block that will include 27 one and two-bedroom apartments is planned.</p>
      <p>Planning documents, submitted to Nottingham City Council, state: "The proposed apartments are all of a generous size relative to many contemporary precedent developments, and feature spacious, well-lit living kitchen-dining spaces with modern kitchen facilities, and good-sized bedrooms with en suite bathrooms to all master bedrooms in two-bed units."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a range of 12 two, three and four-bedroom homes are also in the pipeline.</p>
      <p>All of the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">houses</a> are designed to have a back garden area and parking space.</p>
      <p>The proposed development marks the second phase of the vast project.</p>
      <p>On land to the south work has started to build 23 apartments and 50 homes <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/work-starts-new-73-home-2866958">as part of a scheme called Pelham Waterside</a>.</p>
      <p>Jules Hunt, associate director of FHP, the company marketing the first phase of properties, said 10 of the new homes were already reserved.</p>
      <p>"The first one on Trent Lane is due to move in in February," she said.</p>
      <p>Luxury riverside apartment blocks have regenerated the city's riverside in recent years surrounding where the latest phase of Pelham Waterside is eamarked.</p>
      <p>One project is the River Crescent development, in Waterside Way, which was built in 2008-09 and includes more than 100 two and five-bedroom apartments. It was home to the former England football manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson, during his brief spell at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts County</a> in 2009.</p>
      <p>Developers also want to build <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/riverside-site-planning-permission-81-1449089">81 luxury apartments</a> to the south of Trent Lane at the site of the former Park Yacht Club.</p>
      <p>Chris Hobson, director of policy at East Midlands Chamber, said: “The increase in waterside apartment developments, especially in previously derelict areas, offers a number of benefits.</p>
      <p>"First and foremost, providing a greater number of homes is a positive and we have seen in recent years that these types of projects typically have sustainability and regeneration at their heart.</p>
      <p>“There are also positive knock on benefits including the employment created and contracts won in the building phase, while business is aided by new residents who spend their money locally.”</p>
