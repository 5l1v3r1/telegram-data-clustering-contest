      <h1>Taiwan halts sales of three Huawei phones in wording row</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:48:12+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Taiwan has suspended sales of three Huawei smartphone models that listed it as "Taiwan, China" for timezones and contacts -- a designation the self-ruled, democratic island bristles at.</p>
      <p>Starting Thursday, sales of Huawei's P30, P30 pro and Nova 5T models will be banned until the Chinese tech giant tweaks their operating system, Taiwan's National Communications Commission (NCC) said.</p>
      <p>How Taiwan is described is a hugely sensitive political issue.</p>
      <p>Beijing considers Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary, even though the two sides have been governed separately for the last seven decades.</p>
      <p>"The labelling in these phones does not reflect the facts and has even hurt the dignity of our country," the NCC said in a statement, adding that the commission had "taken strict measures to maintain national dignity".</p>
      <p>It also threatened to permanently ban the sales of the three phones if Huawei refuses to change the wording.</p>
      <p>Local distributor Xunwei Technologies said it was communicating with Huawei over the issue.</p>
      <p>Beijing has been ramping up diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan since President Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016 because her party refuses to recognise that the island is part of "one China".</p>
      <p>Pressure is building as Taiwan heads towards elections in January, with Tsai seeking to defeat an opponent who favours much warmer ties with China.</p>
      <p>Huawei, the world's number two smartphone producer, has previously come under fire in mainland China for the opposite offence -- not labelling the cities of Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China in some Chinese-language settings.</p>
      <p>International brands have routinely found themselves bowing to Beijing's stance on Taiwan, a much smaller market compared to the lucrative mainland.</p>
      <p>Last month, luxury Italian sports car brand Maserati cut sponsorship ties with Taiwan's Golden Horse film awards, directly linking its decision to upholding Beijing's "one China" principle.</p>
      <p>That followed French luxury house Dior's apology to Beijing after a staff presentation featured a map of China without Taiwan on it.</p>
