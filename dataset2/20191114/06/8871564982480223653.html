      <h1>Wife of Medan suicide bomber arrested, police say she planned terror attack in Bali</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:44:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Indonesia’s National Police this morning announced the capture of a woman identified as the wife of the suicide bomber <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/medan-suicide-bombing-suspect-identified-as-24-year-old-student-wore-ojol-attire-at-time-of-blast/">who attacked a police compound</a> in the North Sumatra capital of Medan yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Densus 88 [anti-terrorism squad] has arrested the wife of the perpetrator. The perpetrator’s wife is identified by [her initials] DA. DA is believed to have been exposed to radical values before the perpetrator,” National Police Spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta today.</p>
      <p>Dedi added that, based on the police’s investigation, DA had been using social media to communicate with other terror suspects in order to plan attacks in the country.</p>
      <p>“She has communicated with someone identified [by the initial] I, who is now carrying out her prison sentence at a women’s penitentiary in Medan. And in their communication on social media they planned a terror attack in Bali. That is being looked into,” he said, without going into specifics into what was targeted.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/national-police-reveal-new-details-on-suspected-terrorist-arrested-in-bali-last-week/">police arrested a man and his 14-year-old son</a> suspected of planning a terror attack in Bali during a crackdown on suspected extremists following the failed assassination attempt on former chief security minister Wiranto. It’s unclear at this time if DA had any connection with those terror suspects.</p>
      <p>Yesterday morning, a 24-year-old man who has been identified as Rabbial Muslim Nasution and had explosives strapped to his body, entered the police compound under the guise of wanting to apply for a police clearance letter. Inside, he detonated the bomb, killing himself and injuring six others.</p>
      <p>Police are now searching for Rabbial’s <i>imam</i> (religious teacher/leader), who was not present when police searched his home yesterday. Police yesterday took Rabbial’s in-laws in for questioning, though neither them nor DA have been charged with anything as of today.</p>
      <p>Police say their initial investigation suggested that Rabbial was a lone wolf attacker, but did not rule out that he may be linked to a terrorist network, as the recent arrest of his wife may suggest.</p>
