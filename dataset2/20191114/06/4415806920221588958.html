      <h1>Drivers warned of 'hazardous' conditions on some roads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T06:55:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Drivers are being asked to take care on the roads this morning following sharp frost and ice overnight.</p>
      <p>Temperatures dropped to minus two in some parts, with Met Ã‰ireann warning it could be "hazardous" in places.</p>
      <p>Yesterday also saw the season's first significant snowfall affect routes in Leinster and Munster.</p>
      <p>Lauren Beehan from AA Roadwatch said those driving for the morning commute must take extra precautions.</p>
      <p>"If you're driving in icy conditions, remember to avoid any harsh braking or harsh maneuvers," she said.</p>
      <p>"It will take you longer to stop as braking distances are longer so slow down and leave yourself extra space. Remember to leave extra time to fully de-ice your car before your journey as well if that's necessary."</p>
