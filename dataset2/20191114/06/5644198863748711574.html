      <p>MELBOURNE: Promising batsman Will Pucovski has ruled himself out of selection for Australia's test series against Pakistan due to "matters pertaining to mental wellbeing", Cricket Australia said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old right-hander is the third Australian cricketer to report mental health problems to staff in just over two weeks, with former test batsman Nic Maddinson and all-rounder Glenn Maxwell both taking breaks from the game.</p>

      <p>Uncapped Pucovski was considered a good chance to be named in the Australia squad for the two-test series against Pakistan to be released later on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He reported his issue to team management in Perth while playing for Australia A against Pakistan, where he was out for five in the first innings and did not bat in the second.</p>
      <p>Pucovski, who hit 243 for Victoria in a Sheffield Shield game against Western Australia last year, has previously taken a six-week break from cricket because of mental health issues and left the Australia squad that played Sri Lanka this year for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Ben Oliver, Cricket Australia’s (CA) EGM of National Teams, said Australian cricket would always place the wellbeing of its people ahead of performance.</p>
      <p>"We applaud Will for having the courage to discuss his situation with team management,” he said.</p>
      <p>"Will’s decision not to nominate for test selection was the right one in the circumstances and one that everyone in the Australian cricket family supports."</p>
      <p>Maxwell, a veteran of 110 one-day internationals, 61 T20Is and seven tests, remains on an indefinite break from cricket after pulling out midway through the Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka last month.</p>
      <p>Maddinson, who played three tests in 2016, withdrew from this week's Australia A match on mental health grounds.</p>
      <p>Maddinson had previously struggled with mental health issues and took a break from the game in 2017 after being dropped from the test squad.</p>
      <p>The slew of cricketers reporting mental health problems has placed Australia's player management regime under the microscope in the leadup to the Pakistan series.</p>
      <p>Former test batsman Shane Watson, announced as president of the Australian Cricketers' Association this week, said mental health was a "huge" focus for the players' union and they had been collaborating with CA on mental health strategies.</p>
      <p>A recent mental health survey carried out by third-party consultants Orygen found about a quarter of the elite cricketing population were affected by mental health difficulties, putting the sport on par with the wider population, local media reported this week.</p>
