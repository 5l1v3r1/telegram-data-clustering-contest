      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday reserved its verdict on contempt of court cases against SAPM on Information and Broadcasting Firdous Ashiq Awan and Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan.</p>
      <p>The two ministers had criticised the judiciary’s decision of granting former premier Nawaz Sharif bail on medical grounds. Both have tendered unconditional apologies to the court.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, Chief Justice IHC Athar Minallah questioned the aviation minister for his comments against the medical board.</p>
      <p>“Do you realise what you said? You went against the medical board,” he said.</p>
      <p>The aviation minister responded that it was a political statement, to which CJ Minallah said, “As the federal minister, you cannot give such statements”.</p>

      <p>“The prime minister is saying something else, you are saying something. You are pointing fingers at your own government,” said Justice Minallah.</p>
      <p>He also stated that the minister’s statement falls under the category of contempt of court.</p>
      <p>“You have tried to raise doubts about the judicial decision,” said the chief justice.</p>
      <p>The aviation minister responded that he only expressed doubt over the medical boards’ decision to grant the former premier bail on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>The verdict of the cases is to be announced on November 25.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the IHC issued a show-cause notice to Awan for saying that the IHC decision “will open a floodgate of similar requests by prisoners suffering from various diseases”.</p>
      <p>The notice observed that Awan’s statement was ‘unwarranted’ for a spokesperson of the federal government.</p>
