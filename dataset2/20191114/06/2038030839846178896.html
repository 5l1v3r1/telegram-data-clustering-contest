      <p>Cape Town – On Sunday the search for this year's South African Idol will come to an end when a new winner is crowned.</p>
      <p>The top two Luyolo Yiba and Sneziey Msomi will face off against each other for the last time this season in the grand finale.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the final episode we take a look back at all the Idols winners who have come before them.</p>
