      <p>NSW Police Minister David Elliott faces no further action over a road rage incident in which he told a P-plate driver he "worked for the cops".</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott denied grabbing the 17-year-old driver's arm during the argument on a Sydney road in October but admitted he claimed to work for the police.</p>
      <p>NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller tasked assistant commissioner Mark Jones with undertaking an independent review which has now concluded no further action is required.</p>
      <p>"An independent review into the circumstances of a minor collision involving the minister ... has found the 'no further action' outcome of the initial investigation is appropriate," NSW Police said in a statement on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>But opposition leader Jodi McKay said the assistant commissioner was put in an "impossibly difficult situation" by being asked to investigate his boss.</p>
      <p>The Labor leader said a senior officer should have been brought in from interstate to investigate.</p>
      <p>"I don't think the public can have any confidence that the investigation that is being carried out has been carried out in the right way," Ms McKay told reporters in Sydney.</p>
      <p>"That in no way undermines the efficacy of that police officer. It is simply that that police officer has been put into an impossibly difficult situation."</p>
      <p>Labor is calling for the state government to release the terms of reference for the review and for Mr Elliott to release his police statement regarding the incident.</p>
      <p>But the minister said the matter had been dealt with twice by police.</p>
      <p>When quizzed in parliament on Thursday he criticised Labor's opposition police spokeswoman for not asking about "the emergencies".</p>
      <p>"I've answered every question I possibly can about this fender bender. I don't know how much more I can say," Mr Elliott said during question time.</p>
      <p>Premier Gladys Berejiklian referred to the police statement when asked why Mr Elliott was still in cabinet.</p>
      <p>Police said he attended Castle Hill Police Station on October 27 to report a minor collision that morning between his Lexus sedan and a Mazda utility on Windsor Road in Baulkham Hills.</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott told The Australian newspaper the young driver clipped his car and drove off.</p>
      <p>The teenager's father told the paper the minister chased his son through "the backstreets of Castle Hill" before grabbing his arm which Mr Elliott strongly denied.</p>
      <p>Police said no injuries were reported.</p>
