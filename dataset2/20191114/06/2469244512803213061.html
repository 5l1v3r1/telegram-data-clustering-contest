      <p>Plans have been submitted to turn what was Burton and Evans in Exeter into a large JD Sports shop.</p>
      <p>The sportswear retailer is currently located in Princesshay opposite HMV.</p>
      <p>If planning permission is approved by Exeter County Council it will see the chain move onto the High Street.</p>

      <p>JD Sports confirmed back in June it had its eye on the site as it wanted to move to larger premises.</p>
      <p>Back then a spokesman told Devon Live: "We are moving to a larger premises which will let us present a fuller range of our products in the store.</p>
      <p>"We have not got a confirmed date for the move and reopening, however we anticipate it will be the first half of 2020."</p>
      <p>Evans closed in the spring and Burton Menswear shut its doors for the final time on June 15.</p>

      <p>In April, JD Sports reported a near 50 per cent increase in revenue over the past year.</p>
      <p>And, in the same month, the chain snapped up footwear store Foot Asylum and the merger will take place in the coming months.</p>
      <p>JD Sports, founded in Greater Manchester in 1981, is a specialist multi-brand retailer of branded leisure and casual wear.</p>
      <p>It has over 2,400 stores across a number of retail fascias in 18 countries.</p>
      <p>The chain also bought Liam Gallagher’s menswear chain Pretty Green out of administration for an undisclosed sum.</p>
