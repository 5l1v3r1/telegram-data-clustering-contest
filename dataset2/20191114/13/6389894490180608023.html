      <p>Happy-Go-Lucky actor Eddie Marsan has attacked Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as “either an antisemite, or ignorant” at a Liberal Democrats event today. </p>
      <p>The actor, who has campaigned against anti-Jewish racism, told supporters and journalists that despite voting for Labour since the 1980s he would back the Lib Dems in 2019.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“It feels good,” he added. “Like a political enema.”</p>
      <p>Labour-turned-Lib Dem candidates Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger bemoaned Corbyn and his team for having taken a position that “protected” antisemitism, rather than weeding it out.</p>
      <p>Asked whether she thought Corbyn was antisemitic or ignorant, <a href="https://www.cityam.com/ex-labour-mp-luciana-berger-to-contest-london-seat-for-lib-dems-at-next-election/">Berger – who is standing in Finchley and Golders Green</a> – said she could only “judge by his actions” and that he had “indulged in antisemitic activity”. </p>
      <p>She added: “You can get it wrong once, twice at a push, but the number of examples that we know about is unacceptable.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Umunna also pointed to the party’s problem with antisemitism as justification for pressing ahead with fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury, after <a href="https://www.cityam.com/general-election-2019-lib-dems-defiant-after-canterbury-candidate-tim-walker-stands-down/">Tim Walker stood down to avoid splitting the Remain vote</a>. </p>
      <p>“There are two fundamental issues – is the Labour party a Remain party, and also, you cannot disassociate yourself from the platform where you’re standing,” he said. </p>
      <p>Umunna also stood by the party’s decision to launch disciplinary action against Walker, insisting he had gone public before notifying Lib Dem HQ. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Both candidates also attacked the Conservatives for failing to grapple with Islamophobia and facilitating the rise of nationalism by co-opting the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson was personally criticised for “dog whistle politics”, with Umunna recalling the Prime Minister’s use of phrases including “picanninies” with watermelon smiles”. </p>
