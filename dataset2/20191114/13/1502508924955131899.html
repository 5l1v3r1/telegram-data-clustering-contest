      <h1>World stocks dip as China slowdown deepens, German barely escapes recession</h1>
      <h2>European shares fell after data showing the German economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:25:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/world-stocks">World stocks </a>nudged down on Thursday as Chinese economic data slowed in October and Germany only narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter, adding to worries about the global growth fallout from the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>MSCI'S All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.14% after start of trading in Europe.</p>
      <p>European shares fell after data showing the German economy grew just 0.1% in the third quarter, avoiding edging into a mild contraction thanks to consumer spending, but remaining weak nevertheless.</p>
      <p>The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2%, while Germany's DAX fell 0.4%.</p>
      <p>"Obviously it's better than expected, but actually I would argue is that it's a hollow victory because in effect it makes a fiscal response less likely," said Michael Hewson, chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-markets-1160103.htm">markets </a>analyst at CMC <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-markets-1160103.htm">Markets </a>in London.</p>
      <p>"I think if they'd gone into a technical recession, the pressure to loosen the purse strings so to speak would have been much much greater."</p>
      <p>Bond <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-markets-1160103.htm">markets </a>also appeared to largely shrug off the growth reading, with most 10-year euro zone bond yields were down around 2 basis point in early trade, with Germany's 10-year benchmark at -0.32%.</p>
      <p>In Asia, stocks fell after soft economic data in China and Japan showed the trade war between Beijing and Washington was hitting growth in some of the world's biggest economies.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei stock index fell further, dropping 0.8%.</p>
      <p>Australia's S&amp;P/ASX200 wiped earlier gains to close 0.5% higher, while Shanghai blue chips were up 0.15%, supported by expectations that the gloomy figures would add to the case for stimulus.</p>
      <p>China's factory output growth slowed significantly more than expected in October, as weakness in global and domestic demand and the drawn-out Sino-U.S. trade war weighed on broad segments of the world's second-largest economy.</p>
      <p>Fixed asset investment, a key driver of economic growth, rose just 5.2% from January to October, against expected growth of 5.4% and the weakest pace since Reuters record began in 1996.</p>
      <p>China and the United States are holding in-depth discussions on a "phase one" trade agreement, and cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reach such a deal, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>China's industrial production growth slowed sharply in October, with the 4.7% year-on-year rise well below forecasts for 5.4%. Investment growth hit a record low and retail sales also missed expectations.</p>
      <p>The weak figures also come as market confidence about a resolution being reached weakens, with a new Reuters poll showing most economists do not expect Washington and Beijing to strike a permanent truce over the coming year.</p>
      <p>Trump offered no update on the progress of negotiations in a policy speech on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that talks had snagged on farm purchases.</p>
      <p>U.S. futures were down 0.14%, following a record-high close on the S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Worries about spiralling violence as anti-government protests intensify in Hong Kong have also soured investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>Protesters paralysed parts of Hong Kong for a fourth day, forcing school closures and blocking highways and other transport links in a marked escalation of unrest in the financial hub.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng  fell 0.8% to a fresh one-month low.</p>
      <p>RISK-OFF 'ALIVE AND WELL'</p>
      <p>In currency markets, safe havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained.</p>
      <p>The yen was quoted at 108.70 per dollar, close to a one-week high. The Swiss franc traded at 0.9875 versus the greenback, near the highest in more than a week.=ebs&gt;=ebs&gt;</p>
      <p>"Increasing signs of unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America coupled with the uncertainty around the trade talks is keeping the risk-off sentiment well and alive in FX markets," said Lee Hardman, a London-based currency strategist at MUFG.</p>
      <p>The dollar was 0.1% lower against a basket of peers. </p>
      <p>The Australian dollar skidded to a one-month low after a worryingly weak reading on employment re-ignited speculation about another cut in interest rates.</p>
      <p>Oil rose after industry data showed a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories, while comments from an OPEC official about lower-than-expected U.S. shale production growth in 2020 also provided some support.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures rose 0.74% to $62.83 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.77% to $57.56 per barrel.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.8514% compared with its U.S. close of 1.869% on Wednesday.=rr&gt;</p>
