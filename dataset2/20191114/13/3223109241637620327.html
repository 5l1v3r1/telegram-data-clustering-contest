      <h1>Report: Climate Change Is Making Us Sick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:26:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Climate change is damaging the health of children across the <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/climate-change-marches-emperor-penguins-toward-death-1809790/">globe</a>—even those that haven’t been born yet.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32596-6/fulltext#%20">a study</a> published by <i>The Lancet</i>, a child delivered today will grow up in a world that, by its very overheated nature, threatens their well-being at every stage of life.</p>
      <p>“Children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate,” Nick Watts, co-author of a report tracking the relationship between health and climate change, said in <a href="https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/tl-pss111119.php">a statement</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.geek.com/news/eating-less-meat-can-fight-climate-change-according-to-un-report-1799231/">Consequences</a> of global average temperature rise like extreme weather conditions, food and water insecurity, and changing patterns of infectious disease are entirely out of newborns’ hands.</p>
      <p>Yet they’re the ones who must deal with the fallout.</p>
      <p>“The damage done in early childhood is persistent and pervasive, with health consequences lasting a lifetime,” Watts said. “Without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions … climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation.”</p>
      <p><i>The Lancelot</i> <a href="http://www.lancetcountdown.org/2019-report">Countdown on Health and Climate Change</a> is an international analysis of progress by 120 experts from 35 institutions, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank.</p>
      <p>This year’s report warns that, for the world to meet its UN climate goals, the energy landscape must change drastically—and soon.</p>
      <p>“The climate crisis is one of the greatest threats to the health of humanity today, but the world has yet to see a response from governments that matches the unprecedented scale of the challenge facing the next generation,” according to Richard Horton, editor in chief of <i>The Lancet</i>. “The clinical, global health and research community needs to come together now and challenge our international leaders to protect the imminent threat to childhood and lifelong health.”</p>
      <p>Achieving the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming is ambitious, yes. But it could also mean that a child born today could see an end to coal use by their sixth birthday, and <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/boaty-mcboatface-makes-major-climate-change-discovery-1792544/">net-zero emissions</a> by their 31st.</p>
      <p>“The path that the world chooses today will irreversibly mark our children’s futures,” co-author Stella Hartinger, of Cayetano Heredia University in Peru, said. “We must listen to the millions of young people who have led the wave of school strikes for urgent action.”</p>
      <p>“It will take the work of 7.5 billion people currently alive to ensure that the health of a child born today isn’t defined by a changing climate,” she added.</p>
