      <p>This Morning’s Vanessa Feltz dished out her advice on some festive family issues this morning - sparking twitter outrage.</p>
      <p>One caller explained why she didn’t want her father-in-law at their home on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Lucy, the caller, said that her partner’s father ‘drinks a lot of alcohol’ and explained how her partner has cut down on heavy drinking.</p>

      <p>She said: “I feel so guilty, but I don’t want my children to think it’s ok to drink so much.”</p>
      <p>Revealing that her children are two and 11 months old, Vanessa said: “I don’t think they’re likely to come to a conclusion about whether he drinks too much or not when they’re so young.</p>
      <p>“Even if they did, you could always explain that it’s a very very special occasion, it only happens once a year and lots of grown ups drink too much on that day.”</p>
      <p>Lucy revealed how her partner’s father will encourage him to drink more, and says that he has ‘done so well’ in cutting back.</p>

      <p>She said: “He wants his dad there.</p>
      <p>“They know that they’re just a bad influence on each other.”</p>
      <p>Vanessa suggested not having any alcohol in the house on Christmas Day, but the caller admitted that her father-in-law would turn up with his own.</p>
      <p>Vanessa said: “It’s a difficult one, but on the other hand it’s just one day.</p>
      <p>“So if they both do get drunk on one day, it’s only one day.</p>
      <p>“And then the next day is another day.”</p>

      <p>Viewers took to Twitter after the advice segment, with one branding the advice ‘ludicrous’.</p>
      <p>She said: “Vanessa Feltz, telling a worried young mum its OK if her partner gets drunk on Christmas day, "it's only one day", utterly ludicrous advice!”</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: “Woah did Vanessa just day that if a recovering alcoholic drinks for one day, it’s not a bad thing?”</p>
      <p>Another fan said that the advice was ‘disgusting’, while one angry viewer claimed that Vanessa is ‘not qualified to give advice’.</p>
      <p>A furious watcher said: “Vanessa have you ever had you Christmas day spoilt because of a drunk person let alone your children's day spoilt? I think if you’re supposed to be giving advice to people be more empathetic and actually listen!”</p>
