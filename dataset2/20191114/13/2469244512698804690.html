      <h2>Karl Cooper claims his gravy pots were emblazoned with the word "s***face" when he popped into to grab some KFC chicken wings for lunch</h2>

      <p>A dad was left furious after a rude word was written inside his order.</p>
      <p>Karl Francis Cooper, 38, popped into his local branch on his lunch break and ordered some chicken wings.</p>
      <p>The civil enforcement officer waited around 30 minutes for his £8 order and rushed back to the office with his meal and sides of gravy.</p>
      <p>But he was shocked to find stickers with the word 's***face' printed on both gravy pot lids, he said.</p>
      <p>Karl, from Chesterfield, Derbys., has slammed the fast food chain for providing £10 compensation - branding the gesture a "slap in the face".</p>

      <p>He added: "I was really shocked to see that random, unpleasant word printed across the top of my sides after waiting so long for my lunch!</p>
      <p>"Even if it wasn't meant for me, and the guys behind the counter were just bored or had meant it for someone else, it's just not on!</p>
      <p>"I had nipped out for lunch to the closest branch, minding my own business, and ordered chicken wings.</p>
      <p>"Oddly enough, I didn't think of getting sides, then saw the adverts for gravy and thought to myself that would spice it up.</p>
      <p>"I waited 20 minutes, maybe even 35 or 40 minutes, for my lunch, so was in a bit of a flap by the time my order came.</p>
      <p>"So I had to rush back to work, meaning I didn’t see 's***face' printed on both gravy pots until I had sat down ready to eat it.</p>
      <p>"It really took me by surprise - I sat there trying to think back on the whole occasion and work out if I'd done something to deserve that!</p>

      <p>"Truthfully, it probably wasn't meant for me, but they should be careful!</p>
      <p>"Lots of kids go to KFC - the staff there should really know better!"</p>
      <p>Dad-of-one Karl sent KFC a private message on Facebook with a photo of one of the gravy pots, writing: "just been to one of your restaurants. And I'm very offended by this."</p>
      <p>KFC responded: "Hi Karl, thanks for your message. We are very sorry to hear about this.</p>
      <p>"Can you let us know what restaurant you visited so we can find out why this happened and to stop it from happening again?</p>
      <p>"We would also like to send you out a £10 goodwill voucher to say thanks for letting us know if you can confirm your full name and home address."</p>
      <p>Karl also hit back at social-media critics,who called him a "snowflake".</p>
      <p>He said: "Not only did I have to wait around half an hour for my food, but I was insulted when I'd done absolutely nothing.</p>
      <p>"And then they send out a goodwill voucher that's basically what I paid for it!</p>
      <p>"I know it means I'm getting a free lunch, but it’s not on - they should take this more seriously than it seems they are."</p>
      <p>A KFC spokesperson said: "The Colonel would've blown his lid at this. Looks like a team member was trying to be funny, but it's not on. We're speaking to Karl to make it up to him."</p>
