      <p>CMF for short, these underpinnings translate to better handling, more efficient drivetrains, and a few more driver-assist technologies. The <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/all-new-nissan-sylphy-debuts-in-china-could-preview-the-2020-sentra-133793.html">2020 Nissan Sylphy</a> for China serves as a preview for the North American sedan, which will be built in Canton, Mississippi as opposed to Guangzhou in the Middle Kingdom.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a27206112/nissan-sentra-sedan-future-confirmed/">Car &amp; Driver</a> received confirmation in regard to the world premiere of the 2020 Nissan Sentra, scheduled for November 19th. A huge improvement in terms of exterior design, the all-new sedan also happens to be roomier than its predecessor thanks to a longer wheelbase and wider track. The floating C-pillars add to the visual drama of the econobox with a tablet-style center touchscreen.</p>
      <p>The dashboard layout might come as familiar to those who know their Nissans well, and yes, Nissan is understood to keep the Sentra SR Turbo and Sentra NISMO alive. A four-cylinder engine and a continuously variable automatic transmission should do the trick, especially the naturally aspirated HR16DE and turbocharged MR16DDT combined with the Xtronic <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/c.html#ge-continuously-variable-transmission"><u>CVT</u></a> and D-Step shift logic.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Nissan is willing to keep the six-speed manual alive and kicking for 2020, but chances are the stick shift won‚Äôt go anywhere given the specifications of the Sylphy. As opposed to the Altima mid-sized sedan, the Sentra won‚Äôt receive all-wheel drive as an optional extra because there‚Äôs no demand for such an option in this segment. The Kicks doesn‚Äôt do <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-all-wheel-drive"><u>AWD</u></a> either.</p>
      <p>Codenamed B18, the all-new Sentra shouldn‚Äôt stray too far from the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2019-nissan-sentra-is-800-more-expensive-than-last-year-127890.html">2019 model year</a>‚Äôs starting price of $17,990 excluding destination charge. Packing 124 horsepower as standard, key features of the entry-level Sentra S include 7.0-inch infotainment, auto headlights, RearView Monitor, and Bluetooth media streaming for your mobile phone. üèÅ</p>
