      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> are convinced Cain and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-charity-dingle/">Charity Dingle</a> will sleep together after picking up on sexual tension between the pair on Wednesday night (November 13 2019).</p>
      <p>In the episode, Cain went over to Charity's house to seek forgiveness after her son Moses was kidnapped.</p>
      <p>The day before, Charity had palmed Moses onto Cain, who in turn left him with Liv Flaherty.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the little boy was taken by criminal Sean, who Cain and Aaron had stolen cars off.</p>
      <p>Sean demanded the cars back in exchange for the safe return of Moses.</p>
      <p>Luckily, Moses managed to get home with help from Cain's eldest son Nate Robinson, who found the little boy.</p>
      <p>Cain took a present round for Moses as an apology but Charity wasn't happy with him.</p>
      <p>She told him he "bored" Moira out of their marriage and accused him of coming over so they could sleep together.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However things didn't go that way as instead Charity blocked Cain from having any contact with their granddaughter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-sarah-sugden/">Sarah,</a> and said she would be telling Moira about the incident with Moses, meaning she could stop Cain from seeing his young sons Kyle and Isaac.</p>
      <p>But viewers are convinced the second cousins will still end up sleeping together.</p>

      <p>Charity and Cain have a long history together.</p>
      <p>The pair slept together as teenagers, resulting in Charity getting pregnant with their daughter Debbie.</p>
      <p>They almost married in 2009, but Charity didn't want to settle down, and the pair broke up when Cain slept with Faye Lamb.</p>
      <p>A few years ago they had an affair, and shared a kiss earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Could yet another reunion be on the cards?</p>
