        <b>Transfer chief Victor Orta kept his cards very close to his chest when asked about a possible return for James Milner to Leeds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Orta was asked directly about the possibility of the Liverpool midfielder heading back to his hometown club when his contract runs out next summer in an interview with Italian website <i>Tuttomercatoweb</i>.</p>
      <p>But Orta refused to divulge any information on potential plans, saying: “No, no, I don’t say anything about the names.”</p>
      <p>Only recently, Milner had sparked up talk of an Elland Road return when he suggested <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/liverpool-star-admits-chance-of-emotional-leeds-return-would-be-amazing"><b>it was something that would be ‘amazing’</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, it would appear that the speculation is just at this stage of the season, as we move nearer to the opening of the January window.</p>
      <p>And Orta has also spoken about the chances of improving Marcelo Bielsa’s squad, as <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/leeds-united"><b>Leeds</b></a> continue to push for a Premier League return.</p>

      <p>The Whites landed several loan stars last summer, with the likes of Ben White, Eddie Nketiah and Helder Costa arriving, while Jack Harrison and Jack Clarke also returned to Elland Road.</p>
      <p>However, Orta does not anticipate a busy January, adding: “We have made a conservative line in the summer, we will do it in winter. The new ones need time, in January there are few options.</p>
      <p>“I can say that it will be a quiet market for Leeds. We have information and ideas but I believe little in the winter market. Only 25% of winter shots are successful, it’s incredible.”</p>
      <p>Although Orta’s statement does not explicitly rule out any transfer deals, it does suggest that there will be very few ins and outs as Leeds look to push on again in the second half of the campaign.</p>
