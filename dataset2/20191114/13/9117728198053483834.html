          <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> team principal Mattia Binotto has said that their reliability concerns are becoming “more worrying” due to the issues being a variety of problems rather than just one.</b>

      </p>
      <p>2019 has been a tough year for the Scuderia with engine problems costing them in Bahrain, where <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> lost the lead, in Austria, Germany and Russia.<br/> <br/>But Leclerc will take a 10-place grid penalty in Brazil after the team had to change his spec 3 engine.<br/> <br/><i>“We had Bahrain with Charles, we had problems in qualy in Austria with Sebastian [Vettel], then qualy both cars in Germany, then we had the problem in Sochi,” </i>Binotto said to <i><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-reliability-problems-worrying-binotto/4596445/">Motorsport.com</a>.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“All of them, each single one, all different. It’s not a single factor or commonality, which is even more worrying.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Because if you’ve got one single problem you may address it. The fact we’ve got different problems is showing our entire process is not strong enough towards reliability.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Italian looks to improve the reliability to ensure that victories aren’t lost in the future as well as to fight for a World Championship again, something Ferrari have not won since their constructors title in 2008 and Kimi Raikkonen’s drivers title in 2007.</p>
      <p><i>“What we need is to improve our reliability. If we would be more reliable, we would have more victories. And I think that is the key point for us,” </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Looking at the future, to become world champion, we must become more reliable than we are at the moment.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s down to the designers first, it’s down to the way you homologate and the risk assessment you take in terms of development towards the reliability, so it’s an entire philosophy.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“So it will take some time. But since we’ve had the problem already in Bahrain we’ve tried to put effort into improving it.”</i>
