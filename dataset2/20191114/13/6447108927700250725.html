      <h1>Human Head Studios closes, is reborn as Bethesda owned Roundhouse Studios</h1>

      <p>Human Head Studios has closed its doors after 22 years, CEO Katharine Stull confirmed in a blog post yesterday. The studio is best known for the original Prey, the unfortunate Brink, and the Rune games including the recently released Rune II. The publisher of Rune II, Ragnorak, was blindsided by the announcement. Obviously there have been questions over the long term support Rune II will be getting now that the developer has folded.</p>
      <p>Ragonorak issued the following statement:</p>
      <blockquote>This is shocking news to us, as there are several entities working on RUNE II – we found out about this news when you did. Human Head had a longstanding agreement with RUNE II’s publisher, Ragnarok Game, LLC, to provide ongoing support for the game. We are working quickly to resolve any current technical issues while we build the team that will execute the exciting planned future of RUNE II’s post-launch content strategy. We appreciate your patience and understanding while we work through any launch issues.</blockquote>
      <p>While Human Head Studios has shuttered its doors it doesn’t mean the team has dispersed. Instead, the studio was purchased by Bethesda and will now operate under the name Roundhouse Studios. In the blog post Katharine Stull wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>As a result, we are happy to announce that the development team from Human Head is becoming part of Bethesda as a new studio based in Madison, WI, called Roundhouse Studios. The entire staff has been offered new roles with Bethesda, and it’s exciting to know that our team, which has accomplished so much together, for so long, can continue doing what we love.<br/><br/>This is an incredible opportunity for our small but industrious clan of developers to embark on a new chapter of game development as members of the Bethesda family. With their support and resources, we look forward to creating great game experiences for many years to come.<br/><br/>We want to thank all of you for your support over the last 22 years. Your passion and excitement for games is what has driven and motivated us for many, many years. We’re really excited for what the future holds for us and we hope you join us on this new adventure.</blockquote>
