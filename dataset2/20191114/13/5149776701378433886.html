      <p>A man has been jailed for nine years after being found guilty of non-recent child sexual offences.</p>
      <p>Charles Pluck, 42, of Boâ€™ness, Scotland, was found guilty by a jury of two charges of rape and one of indecency with a child.</p>
      <p>Pluck, who committed the offences in the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a> district in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Pluck was sentenced at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a> on Thursday, November 7 following a four-day trial which started on Monday, November 4.</p>
      <p>He was also given a sexual harm prevention order for life which will supervise and restrict any contact with children under the age of 16.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">Detective Sergeant</a> Hannah Frame, from Nottinghamshire Police's public protection unit which investigated the case, said: "I would like to praise the incredible bravery and courage shown by the survivors in this case in coming forward which then led to the police investigation.</p>
      <p>"They have had to deal with what happened to them, and then relive all the distressing details again through the court trial.</p>
      <p>"I hope that this conviction demonstrates our commitment to survivors of these types of offences, and that when incidents are reported our officers will do everything in their power to bring offenders to justice."</p>
      <p>There are a number of different agencies who are able to offer independent help and support to survivors of sexual abuse in Nottinghamshire.</p>
