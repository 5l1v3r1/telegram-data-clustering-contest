      <p>The Enugu Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested four suspected fraudsters.</p>
      <p>They were picked up at shop 22, Image Digital Studio, Jo-Josh Mall, Ikenegbu, Owerri, Imo State following intelligence that the suspects were operating an illegal business centre which specializes in the procurement and sale of forged documents.</p>
      <p>They allegedly edit and sell documents of multinational companies, identity cards of Nigerian and foreign banks and photographs of foreigners to unidentified internet fraudsters.</p>
      <p>Items recovered from the suspects included several mobile phones, four central processing units, several fake identity cards bearing the names of companies located both home and abroad, a Toshiba laptop computer and two colour printers.</p>
      <p>The suspects have made useful statements and will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded, the anti-graft agency said on Thursday.</p>
