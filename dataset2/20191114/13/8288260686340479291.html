      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Speaking to Norwegian media the goalkeeper has revealed the extent and time-frame of the first choice goalkeeper's injury and says he wants to become number one</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:09:12+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Orjan Nyland says he will fight Tom Heaton to become Aston Villa's number one goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian made his first appearance since December 29 at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on Sunday, coming on for the injured Jed Steer after just seven minutes at Molineux.</p>
      <p>Nyland had previously been limited to Under-23s outings this season until Tom Heaton picked up a calf injury before the Wolves game <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-vilal-orjan-nyland-wolves-17246088">and was treated to an appearance on the substitute's bench</a> for the West Midlands derby.</p>
      <p>He was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> 's number one last season having been signed from Ingoldstadt in summer 2018 but he suffered an Achilles injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season.</p>

      <p>Steer stepped up and helped Villa to promotion and he has had to be patient this seasonm playing backup to Heaton.</p>
      <p>Now with Steer out for an unspecified time Nyland wants to reclaim the number one jersey from Heaton, an £8 million summer signing from Burnley.</p>
      <p>"Now one keeper is injured and will probably be gone for a while," <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/orjan-nyland">Nyland</a> told Norwegian media outlet Dagbladet.</p>
      <p>"So it is me and Tom Heaton who will fight for that place."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Everything is relative.</p>
      <p>"Injuries can take longer than expected, so you never know.</p>
      <p>"It has been suggested that Heaton should be out for two to three weeks."</p>
      <p>There's no shortgate of self-confidence from the 29-year-old Norwegian international.</p>
      <p>"It's about being ready when the opportunity arises," Nyland added.</p>
      <p>"They're betting on me to the extent that they want me to be there,"</p>
      <p>"They have clear goals for me, and I think I'm a Premier League keeper."</p>
