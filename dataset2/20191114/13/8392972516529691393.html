      <p>Former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actor Dean Gaffney, who played Robbie Jackson, is reportedly in talks for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/celebs-go-dating/">Celebs Go Dating</a>.</p>
      <p>Last month <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/eastenders-dean-gaffney-vows-rebuild-20568477">Daily Star Sunday</a> reported <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-has-quietly-axed-robbie-jackson-actor-dean-gaffney/">Dean had been 'quietly axed' from the BBC soap</a>.</p>
      <p>However it looks like Dean could be appearing on the E4 dating show.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>, the show has offered the actor big money to sign up.</p>

      <p>A source told the publication: "Dean has been in the limelight as Robbie for decades, but now he wants to show everyone the real him.</p>
      <p>"He's nervous about it but Celebs Go Dating would also give him an opportunity to find true love and someone who really cares about him after leaving EastEnders again earlier this year."</p>

      <p>Apparently Dean's daughters have given him the green-light and told him to go for it.</p>
      <p>The source added: "Dean is hoping that with some guidance from the love gurus he will be able to find someone very special."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/eastenders-star-dean-gaffney-dumped-by-girlfriend-after-three-years-of-dating/">it was reported that Dean, 41, had been 'dumped' by 25-year-old Rebekah Rose-Ward after three years of dating</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Dean has twin daughters Charlotte and Chloe with his ex-girlfriend, childhood sweetheart Sarah Burge.</p>
      <p>The actor, who played Robbie in EastEnders since 1993, left the soap as his character went to look after injured son Sami.</p>
      <p>But off screen bosses are alleged to have told Gaffney his contract would not be renewed after becoming concerned about his behaviour.</p>

      <p>A source told Daily Star Sunday: "Dean knows he’s made some bad decisions and he is working hard to get his life back on track.</p>
      <p>"He split up from his long-term girlfriend and then he lost his job. But he knows he only has himself to blame."</p>
      <p>The source added: "After everything that’s happened Dean realised that he had to completely change his lifestyle."</p>
