      <p>The NHS is experiencing its worst ever performance in A&amp;E, and thousands of people face rising waits for operations and cancer treatment, according to the last set of monthly health data before the General Election.</p>
      <p>New figures from NHS England show a continuing decline against key targets, as health experts warned the health service was facing one of its “bleakest” ever winters.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was “disgraceful” the four-hour A&amp;E target was not being met, while Health Secretary Matt Hancock said “these figures show just how important it is that we stop Jeremy Corbyn”.</p>
      <p>All the major political parties have pledged to do more for the health service if they win the election, including more funding for health and social care.</p>

      <p>Some 83.6% of patients arriving at A&amp;E were treated or admitted in four hours.</p>
      <p>The target is 95% but it has not been met since July 2015.</p>
      <p>The data also showed that in September, 84.8% of patients started treatment within 18 weeks against a target of 92%.</p>
      <p>The target was last met in February 2016.</p>
      <p>The target to start cancer treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral is also being missed.</p>
      <p>Some 76.9% of cancer patients started treatment in 62 days in September, below the 85% target.</p>
      <p>Overall, more than 4.4 million patients are on the waiting list.</p>
      <blockquote>If this trend keeps going, I fear we could see 100,000 people stuck on trolleys this coming January<cite>Professor John Appleby, Nuffield Trust</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The data comes as the Royal College of Surgeons called on political leaders to keep the 18-week wait for planned treatment – which is currently under review and could be scrapped.</p>
      <p>Nuffield Trust chief economist Professor John Appleby said: “These figures show the next government will immediately be faced with one of the bleakest winters in the NHS’s history.”</p>
      <p>Prof Appleby added: “We have many months to go until seasonal pressures really hit the NHS, but October has already seen an unprecedented slump, with performance against the main A&amp;E target worse than ever.</p>
      <p>“The health service is seeing far more patients, yet one in six is now waiting more than four hours in A&amp;E. If the usual trends continue after Christmas, that would head towards one in five.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile, the number of people waiting on trolleys in corridors because no beds are available has already hit 80,000 – something we have only seen before in the very coldest part of the year.</p>
      <p>“If this trend keeps going, I fear we could see 100,000 people stuck on trolleys this coming January.</p>
      <p>“As the election promises roll in, we should be under no illusion about the money, staff and time it will take to turn this situation around.”</p>
      <p>Richard Murray, chief executive of the King’s Fund, said: “Amidst the political rhetoric of the General Election campaign, today’s statistics lay bare the stark reality for patients across the country who are struggling to access NHS hospital services.”</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn said the four-hour A&amp;E target and the two-week wait on cancer were brought in by the previous Labour government, “neither of which are being met across the whole country”.</p>
      <p>He added: “It is disgraceful and it is a problem of the lack of staff and the lack of funding for it.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hancock said: “These figures show just how important it is that we stop Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>“With rising demand, and with dedicated staff already working exceptionally hard, the last thing our NHS can afford is Labour’s plans for a four-day week and uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, which would cripple our health service – leaving it understaffed and underfunded.”</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said: “This is a damning indictment of the Conservatives’ dismal record on the NHS.”</p>
      <p>In March, NHS England announced proposals to scrap the key targets for patients to be seen in A&amp;E within four hours, or to receive an operation within 18 weeks.</p>
      <blockquote>Despite being a statutory requirement, the 18-week standard has increasingly been forgotten<cite>Prof Derek Alderson and Liam O’Toole</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Instead, figures would be published on how long patients spend on average in A&amp;E and the 18-week target would be replaced by an average marker of the time it takes to start treatment.</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Surgeons and the charity Versus Arthritis called on party leaders to safeguard the 18-week target.</p>
      <p>Writing to all party leaders, Professor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Liam O’Toole, chief executive of Versus Arthritis, said: “Despite being a statutory requirement, the 18-week standard has increasingly been forgotten.”</p>
