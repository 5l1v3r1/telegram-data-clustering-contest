      <p>A graduate was followed by home by two men who described to each other how they were going to "rape her".</p>
      <p>Shannon Clarke, 22, was walking home after a night out when the terrifying encounter took place along Richmond Road in Cathays in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff">Cardiff.</a></p>
      <p>Ms Clarke, who graduated from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-university">Cardiff University</a> in the summer, had been walking back from the Students' Union with friends in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>But after dropping off her friends only minutes from home, she became aware of two men walking behind her.</p>

      <p>She said: "It was only four or five minutes walk so I thought I would be okay, I thought I would be home in no time.</p>
      <p>"I think I had just got to the underpass by Richmond Road when I noticed there were two men behind me.</p>
      <p>"I kept on walking but started to get a bit paranoid.</p>
      <p>"I listened in to their conversation and they were being really, really vulgar about what they would do to me and how they would grab me next time I was out of eyesight and how they would get me down an alley.</p>
      <p>"My initial reaction was just terror, I didn't know what to do."</p>

      <p>Ms Clarke, a charity volunteer, said she sent a message to her flat mate as part of an emergency plan they had arranged beforehand.</p>
      <p>She is now encouraging others to avoid walking home alone late at night, and to create their own security arrangements.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm quite paranoid so I had a plan in place. We have a codeword and I used it so my house mate called me. I was trying to make the phone call sounds as if I was just chatting to the person on the line.</p>
      <p>"I was crying, but silently, and I was walking down by where the cars were parked.</p>
      <p>"They quietened when I was on the phone. My house mate came out and met me after about two minutes.</p>
      <p>"I ran into his arms and had a massive panic attack. The minute they saw I was with someone they went."</p>

      <p>Ms Clarke, who has waived her right to anonymity, added: "I don't think I slept that night.</p>
      <p>"I'm okay now, it could have been worse except for the fact that I had a plan in place.</p>
      <p>"I just kept thinking if they did grab me I wouldn't have been able to fight them off and that's what scared me.</p>
      <p>"I just want to make girls aware it really happens. Stay vigilant and stay aware. I was only five minutes away from home. It doesn't matter how short the distance."</p>
      <p>In a post shared widely on social media, Ms Clarke said: "I was walking back from the SU, along Richmond Road when two men started following me talking about how they were going to rape me and what they'd do once I was out of eyesight from the main road.</p>
      <p>"I was lucky I had a friend nearby, lucky we had a code. Saturday night could have gone a lot worse than it did.</p>
      <p>"My advice to all of your, don't be as stupid as I was. Even if it's a 10 minute walk, Uber back if you're on your own. Make sure you have a crisis code in place, it's sick we have to but it kept me safe."</p>
