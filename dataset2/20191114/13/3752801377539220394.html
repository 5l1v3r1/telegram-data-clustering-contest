      <p>When the men saw the police vehicle, they started shooting and jumped out of the car, still shooting, police said</p>
      <p>Other police units then responded, resulting in the arrest of three men. One of them was injured during a shootout and was taken to hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>Police also recovered two firearms.</p>
      <p>While inspecting the getaway vehicle, the body of a man was found in the boot. Police say it is unknown whether the dead man had been hijacked and killed in the crossfire or whether he was working with the suspects.</p>
      <p>No police officers were injured during the shootout.</p>
      <p>The three men, aged between 24 and 36, are due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate's Court soon on charges ranging from business robbery to attempted murder.</p>
