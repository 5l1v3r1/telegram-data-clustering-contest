      <p>The resignation on Thursday came after Kuwaiti legislators on Tuesday submitted a motion for a no-confidence vote against Interior Minister Sheikh Khalid al-Jarrah al-Sabah, who is a senior member of the ruling al-Sabah family.</p>

      <p>Cabinet resignations in Kuwait happen frequently when elected legislators are set to question or submit a no-confidence vote against senior government officials.</p>
      <p>EmirÂ Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah still has to accept the resignation in order for it to be final. He would then request a new cabinet to be formed.</p>
      <p>Legislators had questioned Sheikh Khalid over alleged abuse of power, charges he rejected. The country's public works minister resigned on Friday after being grilled by Parliament about <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/floods.html">flood</a> damage in the desert country following heavy rainfall.</p>
      <p>Kuwait, an ally of the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> and an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/opec.html">OPEC</a> producer, has the most open political system in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/gcc.html">GCC</a>), with a Parliament that has the power to pass legislation and question ministers.</p>
      <p>The government is headed by a prime minister selected by the emir, who has the final say in state matters. Senior posts are occupied by ruling family members.</p>
      <p>Frictions between the cabinet and Parliament have previously led to frequent reshuffles or the dissolution of Parliament.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Assembly Speaker Marzouq al-Ghanem told local news agency KUNA on Thursday that the emir does not intend to dissolve Parliament.</p>
