      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- A captured American citizen believed to be an <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Islamic-State/?tps=1">Islamic State</a> fighter is being held at the Turkey-Greece border but is expected to return to the United States, Turkish officials said.</p>
      <p>The man, identified as Muhammad Darwish Bassam, 39, is of Jordan descent. He has so far <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/world/middleeast/american-isis-turkey-greece.html">been denied entry</a> into the United States and Greece, his country of choice. Turkey's interior ministry said the United States <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2019/11/14/daesh-terrorist-stranded-on-turkey-greece-border-will-be-sent-to-us">has guaranteed</a> he would be allowed entry once his travel documents are prepared.</p>
      <p>Turkey also said it planned to deport a Briton and seven Germans captured as Islamic State fighters. While the 1961 New York Convention said no person can remain stateless, Britain and France never signed on to it.</p>
      <p>Bassam was captured by Turkey-supported forces in northeastern Syria in October during Turkey's military offensive.</p>
      <p>"There are 2,280 [Islamic State] members in Turkey from 30 countries, all of them will be deported," Turkey Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told the newspaper Sozcu. "We're not a hotel or a guesthouse for terrorists from any country."</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> has also urged European allies to readmit citizens who left to join the Islamic State. He'd said U.S.-backed forces in Syria held more than 800 foreign Islamic State fighters.</p>
