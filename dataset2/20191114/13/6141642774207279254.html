      <p>British champion Jack Price finished on top with seven points at the end of the JMC &amp; LCC’s annual event, after he edged out the legend of the sport and 12-time world champion Dougie Lampkin MBE, who won the BSA Cup for second place, and Toby Martyn.</p>
      <p>Richard Pallot, champion in 2018, took home the Maine Cup as the highest-placed Jersey rider, after finishing fourth in the expert class, with Yeo Vale over-40s trophy going to Nick Life.</p>
      <p>Organiser Stewart Le Breton hailed the event a success, despite the weekend being hit by wet and windy weather.</p>
      <p>He said a number of competitors came from different areas and that the top riders will be back again in 12 months’ time.</p>
      <p>‘It all went really well considering the weather was not the greatest,’ said Le Breton.</p>
      <p>‘We had a lot of riders over from England and France which was good, we had women riders as well.</p>
      <p>‘And we had some of the world’s best who enjoyed and said they will be coming back.</p>
      <p>‘Some of the sections had a few problems on Sunday but everything went down okay.</p>
      <p>‘We probably had about 120 riders in total, the majority were men with a few women.</p>
      <p>‘Most of the riders were from the Channel Islands but it was great to have a 12-time world champion with us and it made for a great spectacle.’</p>
