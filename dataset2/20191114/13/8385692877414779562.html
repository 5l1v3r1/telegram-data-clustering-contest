      <p>Today, Amazon is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">discounting</a> a number of DOSS Bluetooth Speakers, where you can save up to 38-percent on these speakers.</p>
      <p>This is part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, which means that this price is only going to be good today only. And these prices will expire at midnight PST.</p>
      <p>This deal brings DOSS' speakers down as low as $19. The DOSS Soundbox Touch Wireless is just $19.57, and that's down from $39.99 (good for more than 38-percent off of its regular price). This is a really good entry-level Bluetooth speaker. It's going to sound okay, but you won't be blown away by it.</p>

      <p>There's also the DOSS Soundbox XL, which has 32W of power and it is priced at just $44.98. That is a really great price for a speaker that has a ton of power.</p>
      <p>The DOSS E-go Alexa enabled Speaker is also on sale for just $24.48. This is much cheaper than the Echo Dot, and it's portable. With Alexa inside, you're going to be able to take Alexa anywhere you go. And it's also a pretty small speaker, so it's not going to take up a lot of space in your backpack or other bag.</p>
      <p>The DOSS E-go II is also on sale for $24.99. This one does not have Amazon Alexa included, but it is a pretty small speaker. And considering the size, it's pretty impressive that it can put out this kind of power in a speaker.</p>
