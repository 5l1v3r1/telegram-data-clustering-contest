      <h1>Anti-vaxxer poses as federal official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:10:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>A person posing as a Therapeutic Goods Administration official has walked into a Melbourne health clinic and demanded vaccination posters be removed.</p>
      <p>The Commonwealth organisation said it was aware of the impersonation and warned anyone else thinking of trying the trick that they would be breaking the law.</p>
      <p>“Impersonating Commonwealth public officials is a criminal offence,” the TGA said  on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We advise individuals who may be encouraged to impersonate an officer of the TGA that this is a serious criminal offence that may lead to prosecution.”</p>
      <p>The TGA said it broadly prohibits the advertising of prescription medicines including vaccines. However, that is not the case when the medication is authorised or required by a government authority.</p>
      <p>“Posters relating to vaccines and vaccination sanctioned by the Australian government Department of Health under the National Immunisation Program are permitted,” the TGA said.</p>
      <p>“As part of an important public health campaign, this material is appropriate and legal, and provides important health information to consumers.</p>
      <p>“If clinics and health professionals produce their own public information materials, we advise focusing on services, rather than specific products to avoid a breach of the advertising requirements.”</p>
