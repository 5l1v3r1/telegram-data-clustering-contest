      <p>CHISINAU, Nov 14 — Moldova’s parliament today approved former finance minister Ion Chicu as prime minister along with a new government composed mainly of ministers who support Moscow-backed President Igor Dodon.</p>
      <p>The move came two days after a no-confidence vote felled the previous government of pro-Western prime minister Maia Sandu just five months after it took power promising to fight corruption.</p>
      <p>Chicu, who served briefly as finance minister under Sandu’s predecessor, Pavel Filip, pledged continuity in Moldova’s relations with international lenders.</p>
      <p>“The government will continue to fulfil all obligations of the state to external partners and international financial organisations, primarily the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,” Chicu told parliament.</p>
      <p>He said the current IMF programme would expire in March 2020 and that the government was ready to start talks about a new loan.</p>
      <p>Sandu, who wants Moldova to join the European Union, had formed an uneasy coalition with the Moscow-backed Socialists, formerly headed by Dodon, but relations broke down over a proposed reform of how to pick the top prosecutor.</p>
      <p>The tiny former Soviet republic signed a political and trade agreement with the EU in 2014, angering Russia.</p>
      <p>Brussels and the International Monetary Fund support Chisinau with aid, and the EU said on Tuesday it was “deeply worried” about Sandu’s government falling.</p>
      <p>Moldova, a country of 3.5 million situated between Ukraine and EU member Romania, has lurched from crisis to crisis since the disappearance of US$1 billion (RM4.2 billion) from its financial system in 2014 tarnished the reputation of its political class. — Reuters</p>
