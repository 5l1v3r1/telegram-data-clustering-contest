      <h3>Elizabeth Warren Tells Goldman Sachs – ‘Sorry…That’s Not How it Works’</h3>
      <p>Speaking in Concord, New Hampshire, Senator Warren said:</p>
      <blockquote>Yeah, great. So let’s just tell every woman in America, ‘You might have been discriminated against, on an unknown algorithm, it’s on you to telephone Goldman Sachs and tell them to straighten it out. Sorry guys, that’s not how it works.</blockquote>
      <p>Her comments followed those from Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. He said that he is looking into how valid the claims of bias against women Apple Card applications are. Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/goldman-sachs-responds-to-apple-card-sexism-accusations/">strongly denied</a> any discrimination took place.</p>
