      <h1>The luggage 'safety' measure travellers make that might be doing more harm then good</h1>
      <h2>You'll have either seen this at the airport or done this</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:15:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Aimee Robinson, Victoria Jones</a></address>
      <p>Anyone who has ever been at an airport will have seen luggage tightly wrapped up in plastic.</p>
      <p>Or, you might have popped a lock on your suitcase before a flight.</p>
      <p>But an anonymous airline worker has revealed this might not protect your bags at all.</p>
      <p>Instead, they suggest that this could actually be a reason why a suitcase could be broken into in the first place, reports the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1203488/luggage-tips-baggage-common-travel-mistake">Express.</a></p>
      <p>The inside information was posted to a Reddit forum which begs the question: “People who work for airlines, what are secrets passengers don't know?”</p>
      <p>The worker wrote: “It's literally not even a deterrent.</p>
      <p>"Some might take it as a sign that the bag is worth searching.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another user chimed in saying: “Locks on zippered bags are useless.</p>
      <p>“You can pop a zipper with a pen and drag the locked zipper pulls around the bag to close them back up.</p>
      <p>“I’ve done this many times to identify bags that are tagless and locked.”</p>
