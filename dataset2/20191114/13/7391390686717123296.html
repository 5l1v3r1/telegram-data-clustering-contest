      <p>Love Actually - Trailer on YouTube</p>
      <p>The film, from the mind of British legend Richard Curtis, is celebrated not only for its top-notch storyline but also its score. Craig Armstrong is the BAFTA-award-winning composer behind the now famous score and, according to his website, it was a <a href="http://craigarmstrong.com/2003/film/feature-film/love-actually/">whole new experience for him</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"For Armstrong, the film represented the first opportunity to write music for this genre, and his score has become as well-loved as the film itself."</blockquote>
      <p>The orchestral score in <i>Love Actually</i> is in itself a vital character in the film. Helping to transition from storyline to storyline in this patchwork quilt of a film. Its director Curtis spoke to <i>Time</i> magazine, explaining that, for him, the <a href="https://time.com/5611102/richard-curtis-love-actually-divisive/">script was kind of a romcom mega mix:</a></p>
      <blockquote>"I thought if I can do a romantic film, could I do 10 of them and just do the best of? Or the most extreme scenes? So instead of writing a film and having 20 scenes, could I, as it were, write a film and just pick the three best scenes and leave it at that?"</blockquote>
      <p>Bring the tissues and the naff Christmas jumpers. It's <i>actually </i>about get real.</p>
