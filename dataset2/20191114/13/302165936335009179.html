      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 14 — Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick formally announced today that he is entering the 2020 presidential race, bloating an already crowded field.</p>
      <p>Patrick, one of the first US African-American governors, announced his presidential bid in a 2:35 minute video posted on his website.</p>
      <p>“In a spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American Dream for everyone: I am today announcing my candidacy for President of the United States,” Patrick says in the video. He tweeted the same message.</p>
      <p>The entry of Patrick, who becomes the 18th candidate in the 2020 Democratic race, highlights anxieties among party centrists who fear that the left-wing policies of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders will damage the Democrats’ chances of beating President Donald Trump next year.</p>
      <p>Patrick had earlier ruled out a bid in December 2018 but reportedly regretted the decision.</p>
      <p>Former New York mayor Bloomberg took a formal step towards joining the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday when he submitted paperwork to be on the ballot in Arkansas, four days after doing the same in Alabama.</p>
      <p>Both states have early deadlines to register for the primaries, which Patrick has missed.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who like Trump is a septuagenarian white New York billionaire, has yet to officially declare that he is running for the White House.</p>
      <p>Experts say a Bloomberg candidacy could hurt the current frontrunner Joe Biden, the former vice president who is the leading centrist in the race.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what sort of impact Patrick’s entry less than three months before the first votes in Iowa might have.</p>
      <p>Patrick was a two-term governor of Massachusetts from January 2007 to January 2015.</p>
      <p>The Democratic contest has two black candidates, Senator Kamala Harris of California and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Both are languishing in the polls. — AFP</p>
