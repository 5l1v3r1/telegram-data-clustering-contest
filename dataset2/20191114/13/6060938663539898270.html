      <h1>Syed Mushtaq Ali: Ranjane shines as Mumbai stun Bengal by three wickets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:52:14+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>MUMBAI: All-rounder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shubham-Ranjane">Shubham Ranjane</a> shone with both bat and ball, as his unbeaten 30 helped Mumbai defeat Bengal by three wickets in a last-ball thriller of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Syed-Mushtaq-Ali">Syed Mushtaq Ali</a> tournament on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Chasing a modest 154-run target, Mumbai were teetering at 105/5 at one stage. And then thanks to Ranjane's heroics with the bat, Mumbai chased the target on the final ball to remain unbeaten.</p>
      <p>This was Mumbai's fifth win and they are on top of the points table in Group D and have almost sealed their place in the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>The hosts needed four runs to win off the last ball and Ranjane (30 not out off 17 balls, 5x4) reversed sweep a full toss to the third man boundary, as celebrations began in the Mumbai camp.</p>
      <p>Mumbai opener Jay Bista (48 off 41 balls; 5x4 and 1x6) and Aditya Tare (37 off 27 balls) added 78 for the first wicket before the team's middle order collapsed.</p>
      <p>Shreyas Iyer (15), Siddhesh Lad (0) and Shivam Dube (0) fell in quick succession after Bista departed as Mumbai slumped to 105/5 from 102/2.</p>
      <p>Then Ranjane did the rescue act in company of skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/suryakumar-yadav">Suryakumar Yadav</a> (22 of 18 balls), as the two took the hosts near the target. However, Surya fell with three balls to go, putting the onus on Ranjane, who finished the match in style.</p>
      <p>Earlier, invited to bat, Bengal failed to capitalise on the start provided by openers Vivek Singh (56 off 45 balls) and Shreevats Goswami (43 off 28 balls) to post a below-par 153/4.</p>
      <p>Singh and Goswami took on an experienced Mumbai attack to put up 67 runs for the first wicket. But as they were poised for a big score, pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dhawal-Kulkarni">Dhawal Kulkarni</a> removed Goswami.</p>
      <p>Then Ranjane inflicted the damage and his wickets included Singh, Abhimanyu Easwaran (4) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Manoj-Tiwari">Manoj Tiwari</a> (12) to peg back the visitors.</p>
      <p>In the first match at Bandra Kurla Complex, Haryana defeated Pondicherry by six wickets, while in the second game at the same venue, Assam thrashed minnows Mizoram by nine wickets.</p>
      <p>In the second game at Wankhede, Madhya Pradesh got better of Meghalaya by 85 runs.</p>
