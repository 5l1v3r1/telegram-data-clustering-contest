      <p>Ikea has released its first-ever Christmas ad, entitled Silence The Critics, and fans are calling it "iconic".</p>
      <p>The advert aims to encourage people to defy "home shame" when hosting guests this Christmas.</p>
      <p>And it's backed by an original rap – sung by grime star D Double E – that's performed in the ad by a singing rabbit teapot who comes to life.</p>
