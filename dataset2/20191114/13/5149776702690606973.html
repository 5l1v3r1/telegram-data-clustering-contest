      <p>An 'inconsiderate lorry driver' is believed to have seriously damaged a historic city centre building.</p>
      <p>A lorry is thought to have reversed into the Express Chambers, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Upper Parliament Street</a>, on Wednesday (November 13).</p>
      <p>Pictures show a supporting pillar has been damaged.</p>
      <p>A tweet, posted on behalf of city centre community protection officer (CPOs) team, stated: "One of our vigilant CPOs found this dangerous structure yesterday after an inconsiderate lorry driver had reversed into the column.</p>
      <p>"(CPO number) 4374 had secured the area and quickly rang the building owners, putting your safety first."</p>
      <p>The tweet clarified the driver's details had been taken.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Nottingham City Council added: "The damage was spotted by a community protection officer at 10am on Wednesday, November 13, who immediately called the council’s cleansing teams to secure the area, making it safe for members of the public."</p>
      <p>Officials from the council's "dangerous structures team" were informed.</p>
      <p>The authority spokesman added: “The officer also got hold of the property’s management agency to make them aware that the structure was posing an immediate threat to those needing to access the building and the surrounding area, which needed to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>"A representative attended within 20 minutes and the work was completed by the end of the day.</p>
      <p>"The large overhanging piece of stone has been removed and all debris has been cleared.”</p>
      <p>Speaking from the scene, Aaron Adams, 39, who works in security at the Trinity Square car park, said he was told to put barriers down by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">council officials</a>.</p>

      <p>“There was a council guy and two community support officers out here," he said.</p>
      <p>"I was told to come over and put the barriers down.</p>
      <p>“They said there’s someone coming out to make it safe."</p>
      <p>The damage was caused near the Tesco Express on the street.</p>
      <p>The supermarket confirmed on Thursday (November 14) it remained open.</p>
      <p>The historic building is Grade II listed.</p>
      <p>According to Historic England, it was designed by the celebrated architect Watson Fothergill for the former Nottingham Daily Express.</p>
