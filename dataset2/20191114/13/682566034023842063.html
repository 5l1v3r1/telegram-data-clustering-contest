      <p>Cape Town - The <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifier between <b>Ghana</b> and <b>Bafana Bafana</b> could <b>still</b> be televised despite no official confirmation.</p>
      <p>The match, in Ghana, will take place on Thursday at <b>21:00 (SA time)</b>.</p>
      <p>The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and SuperSport have not acquired the viewing rights to official CAF matches.</p>
      <p>South African Football Association (SAFA) chief executive, Gay Mokoena, said ongoing talks between broadcasters are taking place in order for the much-anticipated fixture to be televised in South Africa.</p>
      <p>"It is still a work in progress. CAF is handling it. I spoke to the SABC today and they are also working on something," Mokoena said, as quoted by <a href="https://www.thesouthafrican.com/sport/soccer/ghana-vs-south-africa-sabc-tv-broadcast/"><b>The South African</b></a><b>.</b></p>
      <p>"I am aware that CAF is speaking directly to SuperSport outside of the agreement with Lagardere.</p>
      <p>"As we stand now, nobody is confirmed (to show the game), but I know the SABC is working hard and SuperSport are working hard.</p>
      <p>"We are trying our level best to make sure people get to watch the game."</p>
      <p>However, SuperSport has already released a statement confirming the pay channel will not be televising the clash.</p>
      <p>"We are in a difficult position where we cannot broadcast the CAF games when we don’t have a firm contractual arrangement in place," said Joe Heshu‚ MultiChoice group executive for corporate affairs.</p>
      <p>"SuperSport had previously acquired these broadcast rights from Lagardere."</p>
      <p>Along with South Africa and Ghana in Group C, Sudan and the lowly ranked Sao Tome and Principe round out the group which will see the top two finishers qualify for the tournament in Cameroon.</p>
