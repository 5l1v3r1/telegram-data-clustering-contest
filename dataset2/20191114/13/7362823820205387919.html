      <p>No stranger to expensive products, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/apple">Apple</a> recently released a higher-end version of its popular AirPods wireless headphones, the $249 AirPods Pro. But a Russian luxury brand has taken it several steps further and put the new headphones in gold.</p>
      <p>Caviar, known for remaking iPhones, watches and other devices, has encased the AirPods Pro in 18-karat gold and is selling them for a cool $67,790.</p>
      <p>"The endless luxury of the jewelry art in a grandiose duet with high technologies: the bright novelty Apple Airpods Pro in hands of Caviar masters was transformed into a sparkling gold bar," Caviar wrote on its website.</p>

      <p>The firm notes that the body of the device, known as the AirPods Pro Gold Edition, is "made of one-piece 750-content gold" and can be "considered a truly exceptional accessory."</p>
      <p>If you're looking to give the headphones as a Christmas gift, you'll have to act fast — Caviar said the AirPods Pro Gold Edition is a limited edition of one.</p>
      <p>Last year, Caviar designed an iPhone X with a shock-resistant solar panel, a carbon fiber case and gold accents that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/4500-iphone-x-russian-luxury-brand-touts-crazy-solar-powered-device">sold for $4,500</a>.</p>
