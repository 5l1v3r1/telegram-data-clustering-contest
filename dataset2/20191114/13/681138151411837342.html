      <p>Suffolk police were called at 3.37am this morning to a report that a HGV had smashed through the central reservation between junction 43 at Bury St Edmunds and junction 42 by Westley.</p>
      <p>MORE: <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/a14-closed-for-hours-after-lorry-crash-1-6374617">A14 reopened after closure for 10 hours following serious collision</a></p>
      <p>A spokesman for police said: "The driver has been hurt and has been taken to hospital for further treatment, however at this stage we do not believe his injuries to be life threatening.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of damage that's been caused and it's going to take quite some time to clear."</p>

      <p>Highways England workers are on the scene and were hoping to have one lane in both directions open by 9am if the recovery went smoothly, but at 9.45am it is ongoing.</p>
      <p>The recovery vehicle has arrived at the scene but has still not managed to clear the debris at this time, meaning both lanes are still closed.</p>
      <p>The police also confirmed that the road is expected to remain partially closed leading into the afternoon given the extent of the damage.</p>
      <p>Drivers are being advised to divert and westbound traffic should exit the A14 at junction 43 and use the A143 and A1302.</p>
      <p>Eastbound traffic is advised to take the exit at junction 42 and use the B1106 to Fornham All Saints before taking the A1101 to the A143.</p>
      <p>Traffic has built up heavily throughout the centre of Bury St Edmunds and is at a standstill in some places.</p>
      <p>The surrounding roads are also suffering, particularly the A14, A143 and A134.</p>
