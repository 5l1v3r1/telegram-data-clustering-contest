      <h1>Washington state gun instructors blast new taxes on legal firearm purchases</h1>

      <p>Tacoma, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/washington">Wash.,</a> gun owners are bracing for new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/finance/taxes">taxes</a> on the sales of firearms and ammunition — and residents <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-taxes-on-guns-ammunition-okd-by-tacoma-city-council">aren't happy about it</a>.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://q13fox.com/2019/11/12/tacoma-city-council-approves-new-gun-and-ammo-tax/">8-0 vote</a> Tuesday night, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local">city council</a> approved a $25 per gun tax on retail sales and up to $.05 per round of ammunition. The new levies are expected to raise about $30,000 annually, with the money designated for violence prevention programs.</p>
      <p>Councilwoman Catherine Ushka described the city’s tax plan as a model that other communities could use in addressing gun violence.</p>
      <p>“It gives a signal to other municipalities that it’s something that they can do,” Ushka said, <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article237251479.html">according to the News Tribune</a>.</p>

      <p>While council members argued that the new taxes would prevent gun violence, critics and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/second-amendment">Second Amendment</a> advocates say that the new taxes will drive businesses out of town and put residents at risk.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends"</a> with host Ainsley Earhardt, President of the Tacoma Rifle and Revolver Club and certified NRA firearms instructor Jane Milhans, alongside the club's vice president John Zwosta – who is also VP of the Washington State Rifle and Pistol Association – pushed back against the council's action.</p>

      <p>Milhans survived a home invasion by two men a couple of years ago and volunteers hundreds of hours every year teaching women how to use firearms for personal protection.</p>
      <p>She told Earhardt that, for women, a firearm is an "equalizer" which gives them a "chance to survive."</p>
      <p>Milhans said that when she first heard about the tax, she thought of the women who have taken her classes. She charges $45 for a two-day class.</p>
      <p>"Because we offer affordable classes, I get many of the seniors. There's a huge demand of senior women — widows. Age group runs from 60-87 years-old that want to learn. And many of these women are on a very fixed income," she explained.</p>
      <p>"For them to have to pay a tax or be punished for the actions of criminals just for wanting to protect themself, I thought was just wrong," she said.</p>

      <p>Zwosta, a Marine veteran, got his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nra-rivals-see-opening-as-turmoil-grips-nations-biggest-gun-rights-group">NRA certification</a> for a rifle and pistol after he realized that there was a "lack of training" available.</p>
      <p>He said that he "started volunteering my time at the range to offer up training at low cost to our members and their family and friends."</p>
      <p>"Firearm shops are unhappy because they're imposing a tax that they can't be competitive to be able to sell to the local population," he explained. "They are [going to move out]; they won't be able to be competitive."</p>
      <p>Taxes are set to take effect on July 1, 2020.</p>
