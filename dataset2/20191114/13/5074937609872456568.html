      <h1>Green buildings to receive 30 per cent reduction in permit fees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:48:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Lawrencia Esi Annan/Olivia Ayerh, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Takoradi, Nov. 14. GNA - The Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly (STMA) has instituted a new city policy of 30 per cent reduction in building permit fees for all development projects that are certified as Green.</p>
      <p>Mr Anthony K. K. Sam, the Metropolitan Chief Executive, who announced this at the opening of the incentivized building permit process workshop for stakeholders in Takoradi, said the policy would cover both private and corporate buildings to encourage resource efficient development of the property sector.Â </p>
      <p>He said the STMA was committed to lowering the fees for building permits for projects that are certified as Green by EDGE International Financial Corporation (IFCs EDGE) as part of the Twin City's new spatial development framework.</p>
      <p>The framework includes policies, plans and programmes that would help keep the growth of the Metropolis on track from a sustainability perspective.</p>
      <p>EDGE is an online platform for green building standards and certification for more than 150 countries, including Ghana.</p>
      <p>Mr Sam said with the increase in commercial activities due to the expansion of the Takoradi Harbour and the discovery of oil and gas in commercial quantities, it was envisaged that economic growth would positively impact all sectors, including the building subdivision.</p>
      <p>He said enormous pressure was being mounted on sectors such as housing, roads, electricity and water supplies, market and sanitation, hence the need to incorporate green technology in the building process to ensure the sustainable use of limited resources.</p>
      <p>The MCE said the Assembly was collaborating with some investors to redesign, develop and identify prime sites within the heart of Sekondi-Takoradi into green, affordable, connected and inclusive communities.</p>
      <p>"With this, the STMA will be showing the way in its commitment to reducing haphazard development and championing of green buildings in the Metropolis".</p>
      <p>"As part of the frantic measures to facelift the Twin City, a garden arena is being developed at Fijai Junction for livelihood, leisure and learning by students and teachers of schools within the enclave".</p>
      <p>He said additionally, the City's flagship of "One Child One Tree Policy," was also being implemented in the quest for more green corridors to submerge carbon emmissions in the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Mr Sam said in setting the pace for local authorities in Ghana, the STMA was, therefore, encouraging all developers and property owners to build green to cut the cost of building and building operations.</p>
      <p>The MCE said working together with IFC, the Ghana Green Building Society and the property development sector, the Twin City would increase efficiency in the use of resources, aid in the construction of buildings with low maintenance and operational costs as well as reduce impacts on the environment.</p>
      <p>The Green Project is an innovation of IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, while EDGE was created in response to the need for a measurable solution to prove the financial case for building green and help enhance the main streaming of green buildings.</p>
      <p>EDGE encourages solutions to reduce energy, water and the energy used to make building materials by at least 20 per cent.</p>
