      <p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-speed-badging-1053039/">Google</a> has used machine learning for a variety of practical uses lately, ranging from <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-live-caption-works-android-10-1048376/">live captions</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-live-transcribe-update-987260/">transcriptions</a> to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-does-night-sight-google-pixel-3-work-926333/">image processing</a> and more. Now, the company has a new use for the tech, as it’s able to rate your vocals in Queen songs.</p>
      <p>The company announced its FreddieMeter AI experiment on its <a href="https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/11/can-anyone-match-freddie-mercurys.html">YouTube blog</a> today, and it analyzes your voice with AI to determine how much of a match you are to late frontman Freddie Mercury.</p>
      <p>Google says the AI — which was trained on Mercury’s vocals and people trying to sound like him — analyzes your pitch, timbre, and melody in order to generate a score out of 100. Fortunately, you can choose one of four Queen songs as part of the experiment, namely Bohemian Rhapsody, Don’t Stop Me Now, We Are The Champions, and Somebody to Love.</p>
      <p>FreddieMeter uses on-device machine learning, so your voice sample isn’t being uploaded to the internet. This certainly helps give some peace of mind that your voice sample and associated data isn’t being mishandled.</p>
      <p>FreddieMeter — created in support of the <a href="http://www.mercuryphoenixtrust.com/">Mercury Phoenix Trust</a> to fight HIV/Aids — can be accessed on Android, iPhones, and desktop devices. Check it out via the button below.</p>
