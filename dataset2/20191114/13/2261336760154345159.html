      <h1>Interview: Chael Sonnen recalls fighting GSP ‘in a basement’ back in 2014</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ram Gilboa</a></address>
      <p>As <i>Bellator 234</i><i>: Kharitonov vs Vassell</i> gets ready to go in the city of Tel-Aviv, Israel, there have been some minor developments in another popular fighting field – war – that threaten to collide with the scheduled MMA event. Hundreds of rockets and missiles were launched from Gaza this week by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization – the bulk of them landing a few dozen miles south of the location – with a few actually reaching Tel-Aviv on Wednesday. Without going into who fired at whom first, in the middle-east, on an MMA website; this flare-up has followed two years of gradual escalation involving all sides—Israel, and the various factions in Gaza. Closer to the Gaza border, a mass event such as Bellator’s would be cancelled by local authorities (on account of the current metallic rain) but the Jihad – perhaps MMA fans – so far seem to be largely leaving Tel-Aviv alone, for this round.</p>
      <p>Chael Sonnen, recently retired from professional fighting, is now at the Sheraton Tel-Aviv hotel, in the glass-walled lobby floor overlooking the Mediterranean. The ceremonial weigh-ins for the Kharitonov vs Vassell event have just wrapped up in the conference room below, with Sonnen taking a small part in it—as a teammate for Austin Vanderford, and on promotional duties for the Bellator organization. Bellator is not new to Israel – mid-November in Tel-Aviv is becoming a tradition for them – but it is Chael Sonnen’s and his wife Britanny Smith first time in the state.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You landed here pretty much along with the missiles. It doesn’t bother you. Or does it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mmm, I’m not crazy about it! I don’t love the missiles, no.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you heard any sirens?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, my wife and I were having breakfast and the sirens went off. And I didn’t know, I thought maybe that was a regular thing—everybody around seemed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4a_ie0J0hU">pretty calm</a>. And then some Israelis told me, ‘No, the last time that happened was 3 years ago.’ So, everybody went on about their day like there was nothing to be worried about, so my wife, we did too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It is only missiles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s right, it’s only missiles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Onto more pressing concerns. Favorite fighter right now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Frankie Edgar. I think he’s going to go to 135, he said, and try to make a title run down there. I like him as a person, I like his style, I’ve always enjoyed it. I like that he changes weight classes, takes on anybody.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And on Bellator 234?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, I’ve got a teammate so I’m a little bit biased; Austin Vanderford. [In Tel-Aviv with his wife, UFC fighter Paige VanZant, who seems on vacation as he rests in preparation to take on Russia’s Grachik Bozinyan on the main card.]</p>
      <p>I’m also curious to see how Linton [Vassell] does, quite frankly. I like Linton at heavyweight. I thought he’d be a small heavyweight, I saw him a couple of days ago, he said he was weighing 240 pounds, so, I think the narrative about him being too small is just not true, it’s wrong.</p>
      <p>And Sergei [Kharitonov] is just such a good striker. I thought for many years that Sergei was the best heavyweight striker in the sport. I always thought Sergei versus Junior Dos Santos would be such a fun fight.</p>

      <p>
        <b>In your fighting days you famously fought some killers. Who was the most awesome killer among them, you think, Anderson?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mmm, no, maybe. I’ve fought Georges St. Pierre in a basement, in California, 2014. That was the best fighter I’ve ever taken on. It’s a long story, but Kenny Florian set up the workout. And he said, ‘Hey, Georges is in town, do you want to work out tonight?’. And I said ‘Yes.’ But, I didn’t know he meant GSP—everybody calls GSP, GSP. Kenny sent me a text that said ‘Georges is in town’.</p>
      <p>Anyway, that was it. I showed up at the basement and there is St. Pierre. And I do remember leaving that day and thinking, ‘You know, that guy is special. That guy is different than other people.’ And he had that strength, like that remarkable strength. And I never heard his opponents talk about that. I never heard his opponents talk about how strong he was, which surprised me, because it was… remarkable. Very strong man.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And as nice as he is strong.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, I would agree with that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And in the cage, is there one, or a few guys in particular you’d want to tip your hat to?</b>
      </p>
      <p>There were some really good fighters—Paulo Filho comes to mind. He was a great fighter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>In those days, with Paulo Filho, you had a lot of words about Jiu-Jitsu. And about how Wrestling is superior and is the best base for MMA. Years later, that changed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m a Jiu-Jitsu black belt. I believe in Jiu-Jitsu. I haven’t wrestled in a number of years, I only do Jiu-Jitsu. I think very highly of Jiu-Jitsu. But the fact is, though, that is in a second tier; it’s a much easier sport. Tough guys would go into wrestling. If you’re not as tough, you’d go to Jiu-Jitsu. That’s just the truth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If you’re the toughest you’re going to Judo. Those guys are tough.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You think so?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Yes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That surprises me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It’s just falling and falling and falling and falling and falling and nothing else. Falling and standing back up and falling and standing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I suppose if you look at that from that regard it’s a good point, that’s fair point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But, so, you say wrestlers are the toughest.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, it’s just a tougher sport, it’s just a tougher thing to do. You know, Jiu-Jitsu I think is a lot more intelligent. It deserves a lot of credit; it gets a lot more tactical, and effective in terms of grappling. Wrestling, it’s just kind of hold you down, but Jiu-Jitsu can finish you. I think it deserves its respect.</p>

      <p>
        <b>You had some trouble of your own with commissions – what do you think about USADA these days? Is it too much?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I feel like USADA has really done a good job, and I feel like they’ve also been very fair; there’s very few organizations who could get something wrong, and then come and admit: ‘We got it wrong.’ And USADA has done that a number of times, and I think that shows integrity, and I think they get a little bit of a bad rap. Just because of the way it’s set up. I mean, they’re the judge, jury and executioner and that’s not a fair system. And I think they’ve got, you know, they’ve got a light shined on that, but it’s still the system. They do their due process and they’re not afraid to admit that they’ve one wrong, I think that’s got to mean something.</p>
      <p>
        <b>As long as we’re on possibly controversial topic – </b>
        <b>Dana White</b>
        <b> recently </b>
        <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20948101/dana-white-ufc-president-comments-conor-mcgregor-sexual-assault-allegations-mma-news">
          <b>commented </b>
        </a>
        <b>on this – do you have anything to say about </b>
        <b>Conor McGregor</b>
        <b>’s recent allegations regarding sexual assault? What it means to the sport, if you think it will do anything to the sport at all?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I will tell you: I don’t know anything about it. I got that story very late, apparently that have been going on for a while in tabloids, I never even heard about it, and Dana [White] spoke about it—that’s really all I know. Is Dana said he’s talked to Conor, Conor says ‘it’s not me.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mr. Sonnen, Thank you for your time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you, enjoy the event.</p>
