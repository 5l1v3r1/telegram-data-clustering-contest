      <p>Actor Shaun Williamson who played Barry in Eastenders says he is being haunted - by a GHOST called Rosemary.</p>
      <p>Shaun, 54, also star of Extras with Ricky Gervais, said the spook is stalking his new home.</p>
      <p>He says he was forced to asked for help from friend and medium Derek Acorah who he met on Celebrity Big Brother.</p>
      <p>Shaun made the revelation on Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre podcast.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘’I was in Celebrity Big Brother with Derek Acorah and I believe he sees and feels everything he believes he sees and feels.</p>
      <p>‘’We moved into a new house, myself and my current wife Adele. And straight away there were banging noises - we’d got a ghost.</p>
      <p>‘‘Derek rang me up because he wanted me to be on his radio show and he said 'Rosemary' - 'Rosemary' is the name of the lady who lives in your house.</p>
      <p>‘’Boys always call their toys boys’ names and girls call their toys girls’ names. So I’d always called it Dennis - and I’d shout ‘Dennis I’m trying to work’.</p>
      <p>‘’But it’s Rosemary - so basically yes we do have a noisy ghost in our house and according to Derek it’s called Rosemary.</p>
      <p>‘’I do believe the spirits of people linger where they were and all the time there is more evidence of poltergeists - so I assume there must be.’’</p>
