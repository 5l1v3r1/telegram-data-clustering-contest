      <h2>Councillor Scott Davidson has asked about the possibility of installing pedestrian safety fencing and increasing the 20 mph stretch among other measures.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:45:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Irvine Herald, Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/irvine-herald/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>Calls have been made for traffic safety measures on a busy school route after a nine-year-old girl was hit by a car outside Kilwinning Academy. </p>
      <p>The Abbey Primary pupil, who is in a stable condition, was airlifted to hospital following the crash on Dalry Road in the town on October 30.</p>
      <p>Now parents are voicing fears about safety on the route. </p>
      <p>The pavements on the road are too narrow and the pedestrian railings could  be extended, a North Ayrshire council meeting heard.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Residents have also called for a lollipop person to be hired to help kids cross. </p>
      <p>It is understood the incident took place between Abbey Primary and Kilwinning Academy. <br/>Councillor Scott Davidson has asked about the possibility of installing pedestrian safety fencing and increasing the 20 mph stretch among other measures.</p>
      <p>A number of people have contacted him with their concerns.</p>

      <p>The Kilwinning politician said: “Sadly a young girl from the primary school was injured. I’m sure all present in council today will join in wishing her a speedy recovery and wish her family the very best in what must be a very difficult time for them.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at the council meeting yesterday, he  continued: “The main pavements have narrow paths, which the pupils and parents use at the busiest possible times. Additionally there are large spaces in between the pedestrian railings, which could possibly be extended or filled in between.” The SNP councillor also pointed out how the 20mph stretch is short. </p>
      <p>He quizzed Councillor Jim Montgomerie, cabinet member for place, on whether a traffic assessment will be carried out on the number and speed of vehicles on the road during peak school times. He also asked if a lollipop person on duty would improve matters and if the pavements were suitable.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Councillor Davidson told councillors another child had a close call after falling on to the narrow pavement and nearly in the way of an oncoming car. </p>
      <p>Councillor Jim Montgomerie described the collision as a  very “distressing incident.” <br/>The Saltcoats Labour politician said: “I know that the thoughts of everyone in this chamber have been with the young girl involved and her family.</p>
      <p>“I understand that she is in a stable condition. The incident is the subject of a Police Scotland investigation and details of the incident and the factors contributing to it are still to be made available.” <br/>He pointed out the A737 is a trunk road and responsibility lies with Transport Scotland. <br/>But he added: “ We will await the findings of the investigation and then work with Police Scotland and Transport Scotland to review any measures which can be undertaken to  improve road safety at this location. “</p>
