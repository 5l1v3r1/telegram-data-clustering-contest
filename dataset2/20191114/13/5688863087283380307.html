        <b>Australia Test captain Paine is of the opinion that it's on the team and management to support cricketers during the difficult times that they face after Will Pucovski decided to take a break citing mental health. Paine also stated that Pucovski did the right thing as mental health is a priority.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's been quite a month for Cricket Australia as, as many as three players have pulled out of the national team or selection to nurse their mental health. While <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/glenn_maxwell">Glenn Maxwell</a> and Nic Maddison were the first to sideline themselves, their Victoria teammate Will Pucovski has also joined them to take care of his mental health.</p>
      <p>After the tour match against Pakistan, where the Australia A side crumbled against a fiery Pakistan bowling attack, Pucovski informed the selectors that he is unavailable for selection due to mental health issues he is suffering. Australia Test skipper Tim Paine, who is also a good friend of Pucovski, has promised that he will reach out to him and support his mate in the process of overcoming the hurdle as he stressed that mental well being is a priority.</p>
      <p>"I've left him alone today, I'll give him a ring probably tomorrow. I've obviously got a lot of time for Will as a person, he's a great young kid and it's sad to see him going through this. We know how talented he is," Paine told cricket.com.au in Adelaide.</p>
      <p>"I think making the right decision to step away and take care of himself and get himself healthy and in the right state of mind is going to be important because we think he's someone who's got a huge Test future. But first and foremost we want Will to be a happy young man, and I think sometimes we forget that he's still a kid.</p>
      <p>"He's had a lot of pressure put on him from outside sources, and expectation and hopefully he's in a position in the next few years to fulfill that potential that he's got. The first priority for us, and for Will, is his mental wellbeing."</p>
      <p>Paine acknowledged that his role as the skipper of the national team is not only to lead the team on the field but also lend a helping hand and understanding all the players. Paine also pointed out that the fact that high profile cricket players are being affected by mental illness is a clear indicator that the situation could be worse among the masses.</p>
      <p>"I think to say it's a cricket-related issue is wrong. I think it's a big issue in all walks of life. It's a very complex issue, we know that, and I think Cricket Australia and cricket, in general, have supported the three guys in particular that are having a spell at the moment," Paine added.</p>
      <p>"We can only be there to support, and hopefully their mental wellbeing is in a good place eventually, and we can get those guys back out playing cricket. It's what they do, and it's for us to support them and help them through some difficult times."</p>
