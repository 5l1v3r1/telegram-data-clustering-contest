      <p>Goulding shared her cover of “River” by Joni Mitchell Thursday on Twitter. The cover can be streamed exclusively on Amazon Music.</p>
      <p>The English singer-songwriter does not try and reinvent the wheel with her cover. Goulding’s effort mostly stays true to the original in composition but has a slightly more restrained pace.</p>

Goulding, 32, had threatened to pull out due to fan backlash over the charity’s LGBTQ stance.</p>
