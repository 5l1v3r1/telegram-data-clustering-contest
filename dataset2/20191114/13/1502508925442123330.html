      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The fourteen-day India International <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/trade-fair">Trade Fair </a>opened on Thursday albeit with lesser availability of space this year owing to Pragati Maidan's ongoing make-over.</p>
      <p>Union Transport and MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the fair and suggested that the ITPO (India Trade Promotion Organisation) should explore public-private-partnership model to build 30 to 40 mega exhibition-cum-convention centres across the country.</p>
      <p>"By supporting government as a facilitator we can make atleast 30 to 40 centres like Pragati Maidan in the country. This country needs and the government's capacity is limited, budgetary constraints are there but this activity by supporting some government equity, we can make it economically viable," Gadkari said adding that this type of activity is going to create more employment opportunities.</p>
      <p>Besides, Gadkari highlighted that the World Bank, ADB and KfW are ready to provide a credit line for MSMEs at a low interest cost and, he wants to provide this credit line to the poor and economically backward entrepreneurs in backward areas.</p>
      <p>Organisers of the fair ITPO expressed confidence that the redevelopment of Pragati Maidan into a state-of-the-art integrated exhibition cum convention centre (IECC) shall be completed before the end of next year.</p>
