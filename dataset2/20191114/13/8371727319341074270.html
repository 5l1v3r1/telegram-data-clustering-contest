      <p>Liquid Telecom has announced an extension of its telecom operations with Microsoft. The new development will see the pan-African company launch a new series of enterprise cloud services that target to improve business collaborations in the region, as well as bolster productivity and general business acceleration.</p>
      <p>Liquid, which prides itself in low-latency and high-capacity fibre connections, says that the collaboration will serve several businesses across the continent, having <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/11/13/liquid-telecom-west-africa-expansion/">deployed Africa’s first connection linking East and West Africa</a>.</p>
      <p>Liquid is also a launch partner in the continent for the new Azure Peering Service. Microsoft has <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/11/12/microsoft-edge-location-nairobi/">already installed 31 new Azure edge sites in Nairobi</a>, and others in Lagos, Nigeria. Cairo is also reported to be the next target.</p>
      <p>The new enterprise cloud networking services use Liquid Telecom’s fibre network that complements Azure for reliable internet connectivity and optimized services for MS products such as Office 365.</p>
      <p>“The launch of these new services marks an exciting new chapter in the trusted collaboration between Liquid Telecom and Microsoft, and act as a catalyst for business growth across Africa,” says David Behr, Group Chief Digital Officer, Liquid Telecom.</p>
      <p>“Liquid Telecom is one of Microsoft’s fastest-growing network connectivity partners anywhere on the African continent,” says Nic Rudnick, Group CEO, Liquid Telecom.</p>
      <p>Liquid and Microsoft started doing business back in 2017. Over that period, Liquid has reportedly achieved MS’s independent technical support metrics.</p>
      <p>“The scale and reach of our fibre network, data centre infrastructure, local knowledge, and expertise enable Microsoft enterprise customers to realize their business objectives more quickly and effectively. Together, Liquid Telecom and Microsoft are creating a modern business foundation for customers across Africa – one that inspires innovation, cloud-paced change, compliance, and business growth,” added Nic Rudnick.</p>
