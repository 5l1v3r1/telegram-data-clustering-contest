      <p>Earlier this week, a royal expert claimed the Queen may be "a little hurt" that the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Duke</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/">Duchess of Sussex</a> aren't spending Christmas with her at Sandringham.</p>
      <p>It was thought the couple would spend son Archie's first Thanksgiving in his mother's homeland, America, before heading back to his father's for his first Christmas.</p>
      <p>However, the couple <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/harry-and-meghan-have-told-the-queen-they-wont-be-spending-archies-first-christmas-with-her/">recently confirmed they will be spending Christmas with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland</a>.</p>

      <p>A statement from the couple said: "Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, their royal highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the duchess' mother Doria Ragland."</p>
      <p>It said the couple are "looking forward to extended family time".</p>
      <p>The statement added: "This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty the Queen.</p>
      <p>"For security reasons, we will not be providing further details on their schedule at this time."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, royal biographer Ingrid Seward previously said that Christmas at Sandringham can be "quite stressful" and the couple may not want to go with Archie at such a young age.</p>

      <p>She said: "I think it’s sad they don’t want to be part of the family gathering, particularly now the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are in their dotage.</p>
      <p>"The Queen might be a little hurt but she’s far too gracious to ever let it show or be known."</p>
