      <p>Union Steel Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dharmendra-pradhan">Dharmendra Pradhan </a>stressed on the need to make India self-sufficient in high grade steel and sought collective efforts of the industry to make the sector future-ready.</p>
      <p>Metals, including steel, continue to play a vital role in building India a modern economy, the minister said, adding that there is a strong positive correlation between steel usage and a nation's economic growth.</p>
      <p>"He has appealed to the delegates to embrace challenge of producing high grade steel for greater self-sufficiency.

Professionals from the metallurgical fraternity will have an important role to play in achieving this quantum leap and creating green pathways to make the Indian steel sector future-ready," a statement quoted Pradhan as saying.</p>
      <p>The National Steel Policy 2017 was formulated to create a more self-sufficient and globally competitive <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/steel-industry">steel industry </a>with a crude steel capacity of 300 million tonnes by 2030, he said.</p>
      <p>The steel sector will have a key role to play in the making of a New India envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the minister said.</p>
      <p>"The next trajectory of growth, fuelled by government's key focus on building infrastructure for future, creating smart cities, industrial corridors and so forth will further boost steel consumption."<br/><br/>Import of high-grade steel was one of the issues the industry faced in 2018-19.</p>
