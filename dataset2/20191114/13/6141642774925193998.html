      <p>Asda bosses have blamed “customer concerns over Brexit” after the supermarket suffered sliding sales over the past three months.</p>
      <p>The UK supermarket chain reported a 0.5% decline in like-for-like sales in the quarter to September 30, as it dipped from 0.5% growth in the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>Doug McMillon, the boss of Asda owner Walmart, said that Brexit fears “continue to negatively affect customer spending patterns” for the chain.</p>
      <p>Asda chief executive and president Roger Burnley added that customers have had “little respite” from political and economic uncertainty in recent months, which has influenced spending.</p>
      <blockquote>I am absolutely committed to securing the future of our business for the benefit of our colleagues, our customers and our communities – whatever external challenges we may face<cite>Roger Burnley, Asda chief executive and president</cite></blockquote>
      <p>On Tuesday, data from Kantar said Asda saw sales decline by 1.2% in the 12 weeks to November 3.</p>
      <p>The big four supermarkets all reported recent declines, according to the data, falling behind rapid growth from German discounter rivals, such as Lidl, which it said saw 8.8% sales growth over the period.</p>
      <p>Asda and rival Sainsbury’s attempted to counteract the competition of the discounters by agreeing a multibillion-pound merger last year, but the move collapsed after it was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in April.</p>
      <p>In July, Mr Burnley said Asda could be floated on the stock market in the next two or three years, as Walmart looks to offload the UK business.</p>
      <p>Despite the slump in total sales, Asda said it saw “strong” online grocery sales over the period, which it claimed was “two times the growth of the overall market”.</p>

      <p>He added: “I am absolutely committed to securing the future of our business for the benefit of our colleagues, our customers and our communities – whatever external challenges we may face.</p>
      <p>“As we enter the busiest trading period of the year, I am confident that we are ready and raring to go and I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to every one of our colleagues, who I know will pull out all the stops to make this Christmas extra special for our customers.</p>
      <p>“Whilst the retail sector continues to face challenges as a whole, I know that Asda is built on strong foundations and is at its best when we are able to work as one team, delivering for our customers.”</p>
