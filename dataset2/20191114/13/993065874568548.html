      <p>Heston Blumenthal will judge a new cooking competition featuring the “world’s first edible set”.</p>
      <p>The six-part series will air on Channel 4 and Netflix and is inspired by “food porn” – the trend for putting snaps of envy-inducing meals on social media, TV bosses say.</p>
      <p>Comedian Jayde Adams will present the series, in which cooks are asked to “work magic” with commonplace ingredients.</p>
      <p>An “enchanted garden” on set will contain carrots, edible blossom, chocolate soil and a drinkable babbling brook.</p>

      <p>US chef Carla Hall and Swedish restaurateur Niklas Ekstedt will also be judges in the competition, called Crazy Delicious.</p>
      <p>Blumenthal, known for his outlandish culinary creations, said: “In Crazy Delicious we’re asking for dishes that not only taste great but are also visually spectacular, emotionally powerful and nostalgic, so it’s incredibly tough!</p>
      <p>“The cooks in Crazy Delicious were certainly fearless. I’ve spent my career trying to perfect these kinds of dishes and I know from experience that creativity and perfection do not always sit comfortably together. I was amazed at how ambitious some of the cooks were.”</p>
      <p>Adams said: “This show is like nothing you’ve seen before.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Crazy Delicious will air on Channel 4, and will be available on Netflix worldwide – excluding the UK – in early 2020.</i>
