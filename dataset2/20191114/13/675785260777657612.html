      <p>A woman was filmed biting her boyfriend's pet cat on the head in a desperate attempt to get back at him after they had argued.</p>
      <p>Daria Turchina, 38, streamed the animal abuse live on Telegram, a messaging app similar to Whatsapp.</p>
      <p>At the start of the clip she can be seen smiling at the camera while holding the innocent moggie.</p>
      <p>But she then holds the cat to her chest and says: "Do you know that I can kill you? I can kill you, crush you.</p>
      <p>"Do you understand me?"</p>
      <p>Daria, from Dmitrov, in the western Russian region of Moscow Oblast, called the cat a 'b****' and 'filthy little w*****'.</p>

      <p>She then bites the pet which reacts by howling in pain.</p>
      <p>In another clip she puts the cat on her lap and presses onto its paws strongly.</p>
      <p>Local media reported that Daria had a heated row with her boyfriend and was trying to upset him by threatening and harming him the cat.</p>
      <p>The details of the argument were not reported and it's unclear whether local authorities will investigate her for appearing to abuse an animal.</p>
      <p>Web user FoxdieZero' said: "She is such a skunk herself. Unfortunately, nothing new there."</p>
      <p>EKasatka' commented: "There are way too many people like her around. Usually they use kids instead of cats."</p>
      <p>'Printxdatskij' wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "What did she do really? Yelled at a cat? Is that a good enough reason to send in a SWAT team to stop her?"</p>
