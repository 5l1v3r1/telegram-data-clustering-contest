      <h1>High-performance Chetak in the works</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:44:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:44</time> by <a rel="author">Vishal Venugopal</a></address>
      <p>The more powerful e-scooter will be sold under the KTM/Husqvarna brand.</p>
      <p>A month ago, Bajaj revealed its first electric scooter and revived an iconic moniker with the new Chetak e-scooter. The unveil also witnessed the flag-off of the 3,000km-long ‘Chetak Electric Yatra’ that has just concluded in Pune in the presence of Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto.</p>
      <p>At the event, Rajiv Bajaj revealed some very interesting information – the company is working on a performance-oriented version of the Chetak, which will be sold under the KTM or Husqvarna brand. Now KTM is no stranger to high-performance electric two-wheelers. The brand sells the Freeride E-XC – the electronic counterpart of the Freeride 250 R enduro bike – in international markets. And lest we forget, the manufacturer also revealed the E-Speed electric scooter concept at the 2013 Tokyo motor show, whose final product never saw the light of day.</p>
      <p>However, KTM is now expected to use the Chetak platform to make its first electric scooter. The Chetak features retro-styling and is powered by a 4kW motor. We can also expect the KTM/Husqvarna iteration of the model to feature a much bolder and sharper design language with better performance; and, most likely, more premium hardware in terms of suspension and brakes. </p>
      <p>This high-performance scooter is still very much in its nascent stages, so a launch in the near future is unlikely. However, the Chetak is here and we will see it go on sale in early 2020.</p>
