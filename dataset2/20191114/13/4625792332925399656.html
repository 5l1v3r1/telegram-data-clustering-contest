      <h1>Deval Patrick enters presidential race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:11:48+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick <a href="https://devalpatrick2020.com/">launched</a> his bid to be the Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Patrick, 63, posted a video announcing his bid on a campaign website. In the video, Patrick described his upbringing and the problems he sees in the United States. He also acknowledged his late entry into the crowded race.</p>
      <p>“I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field. They bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,” Patrick said. “But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country.”</p>
      <p>He added, “This time is about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader, as important as that is, but about delivering instead for you.”</p>

      <p>Rumors that Patrick <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deval-patrick-preparing-2020-presidential-bid">planned to enter the race</a></u> started swirling earlier this week, as did rumors that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would enter the race. Bloomberg <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bloomberg-files-for-2020-democratic-primary-in-alabama">filed to run in Alabama</a></u> before the filing deadline hit on Monday but has not officially announced his candidacy.</p>
