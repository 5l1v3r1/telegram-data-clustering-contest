      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - U.S. producer prices rose 0.4% in October, the biggest jump in six months, reflecting a surge in energy costs.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department says the October increase in its producer price index, which measures price pressures before they reach consumers, followed a 0.3% decrease in September.</p>
      <p>Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.3% in October. Over the past year, wholesale prices are up a modest 1.1% while core prices have risen 1.6%.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the government reported that consumer prices rose 0.4% in October, the fastest pace since March, with that gain also driven by a surge in energy prices.</p>
