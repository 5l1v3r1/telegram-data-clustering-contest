      <p>Wales will head to Azerbaijan without goalkeeper Danny Ward and midfielder Tom Lawrence.</p>
      <p>The Welsh Football Association said on Thursday that Leicester keeper Ward would miss the trip due to personal reasons, while Derby’s Lawrence is ill.</p>
      <p>Wales head to Baku for their Euro 2020 Group E qualifier with eight points from their six matches so far.</p>
      <p>Ward is a regular understudy to number one Wayne Hennessey, though Lawrence – a winner of 20 caps – may have started.</p>
      <p>Wales face Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday.</p>
