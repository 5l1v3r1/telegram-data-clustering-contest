      <h1>West Ham's daunting run of fixtures is make or break for manager Manuel Pellegrini</h1>
      <h2>In the first of our new weekly columns, Hammers writer Sam Inkersole analyses the next five games and what it means for the manager's future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:56:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:56</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham have had one of the easiest schedules in the Premier League campaign so far but in the last two months have made a complete horlicks of it.</p>
      <p>Six games without a win, one victory in their last nine, has seen the pressure piled on Manuel Pellegrini to start showing why the Hammers are paying him £8m per year to be the manager of the team.</p>
      <p>When the Chilean was appointed some 18 months ago, he became the highest-paid manager in the club's history and was the first sign of ambition of moving towards the top six of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>A £90m spending spree followed when the club's transfer record was broken twice by Pellegrini, the £25m for Issa Diop subsequently followed by the £42m capture of Felipe Anderson from Lazio towards the end of the window.</p>
      <p>Lukasz Fabianski, Ryan Fredericks, Fabian Balbuena, Andriy Yarmolenko and Jack Wilshere arrived as well to bolster the ranks and West Ham meant business.</p>
      <p>A year and a half down the line and having broken the transfer record again, the focus is on the Chilean to turn the ship around following a frankly alarming run of form that has seen his team lose games, lose confidence, get bullied, look confused and despite being just 12 games into the season - knackered.</p>

      <p>David Gold and David Sullivan would have expected some return on their investment by now. When the Hammers were sitting in joint-third after seven games of the season, the confidence was brimming. A good run of fixtures were coming up, West Ham had lost just once thus far, talk of a top five spot at Christmas was more than understandable.</p>
      <p>Not so much now.</p>
      <p>Since the Hammers moved to London Stadium in 2016, there has been plenty of talk of moving to the "next level" and that was supposed to have started with the appointment of a Premier League winning manager, who does not become a bad one overnight. The first season of Pellegrini's was the calmest we have seen in east London since they left Upton Park.</p>
      <p>Now though, the tension is boiling up again. We're not expecting the protests of that fateful Burnley game in 2017 in E20 to flare up again but if things carry on like this, it could get close. The London Stadium has been a pressure cooker before which eventually boiled over and it is close to doing so again.</p>
      <p>The apathy towards the former Olympic Stadium has returned, the board is coming under fire again, the team isn't performing again - we've seen all this before.</p>
      <p>Questionable tactics, questionable team selections, questionable transfers and questionable performances from the squad is what has seen the Hammers drop from fifth to 16th in the space of a couple of months.</p>
      <p>Reports are emerging, supposedly from inside the club, that director of football and Pellegrini ally Mario Husillos is coming under big pressure for the past summer acquisitions. Goalkeeper Roberto is a good shot stopper but gaffe prone the rest of the time, Pablo Fornals is taking his time to adapt to the Premier League, Sebastien Haller has one goal since August.</p>

      <p>Pellegrini has to take some flak as well as he has shown no signs of being able to turn things around just yet. He has chosen to tinker with his personnel rather than try something new, sticking rigidly to his 4-2-3-1 which simply isn't working.</p>
      <p>In game as well, the decision to take Robert Snodgrass off against Sheffield United when looking for a late winner was questionable, plus the selection of Pablo Zabaleta at right back against rapid winger Allan Saint-Maximin for the defeat to Newcastle was downright bizarre. We could all see what was going to happen.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Then there is Angelo Ogbonna's axing from the starting eleven for the out-of-form Fabian Balbuena, persisting with an equally off-colour Manuel Lanzini prior to belatedly dropping the midfelder, the mysterious absences of Arthur Masuaku from matchday 18s - it's all adding up to trouble.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has admitted he needs to restore confidence to his team but his tactics, decisions, rigidity and puzzling selections is what has drained it in the first place.</p>
      <p>West Ham play Spurs next and if there is a result that can turn things around, beating Mauricio Pochettino's men would do just that. Then it's a visit to Chelsea and Wolves, followed by a home game against Arsenal and another under-fire manager in Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>It could get worse before it gets better for the Hammers. If it does get worse then Pellegrini will truly be under the gun.</p>
