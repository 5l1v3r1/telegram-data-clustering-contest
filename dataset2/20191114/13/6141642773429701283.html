      <p>Thierry Henry has been appointed as head coach of Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal striker has signed a two-year contract, with the option of a further season, following an unsuccessful stint in charge of Monaco which ended in January.</p>
      <p>Henry finished his playing career in MLS, scoring 51 goals in 122 appearances for the New York Red Bulls from 2010 to 2014.</p>

      <p>“It’s an honour to become head coach of the Montreal Impact and return to MLS,” Henry told the club’s official website.</p>
      <p>“It’s a league that I know well (and) where I had a great time.</p>
      <p>“Being in Quebec, in Montreal, which has a huge multicultural heritage, is something extraordinary. I have always had an eye on this club and now I am there.”</p>
      <p>Henry, who also played for Juventus and Barcelona and was a World Cup winner with France in 1998, lasted only three and a half months in charge of Monaco after failing to rejuvenate the struggling side following the departure of Leonardo Jardim, who later returned to the role as Henry’s successor.</p>
      <p>But Impact sports director Olivier Renard is confident the 42-year-old, who previously served as assistant to Belgium boss Roberto Martinez, is the right man to bring success to the Canadian outfit.</p>

      <p>“We are very happy to have Thierry join us,” said Renard. “Young and dynamic, he is very familiar with MLS and meets the criteria we set.</p>
      <p>“This appointment, two months before the resumption in January, will allow us to have the time to build the team with the one who will pilot it.”</p>
      <p>Impact president and CEO Kevin Gilmore added: “Henry will bring a new dynamism to our club.</p>
      <p>“He shares our vision of wanting to elevate this organisation by helping us achieve our goals on and off the field.</p>
      <p>“He is a competitor and a leader who has distinguished himself at the highest level throughout his career. He brings his skills with him to Montreal, a place he wants to be.”</p>
      <p>The Impact finished ninth in the Eastern Conference and 18th overall under Wilmer Cabrera last season.</p>
