      <h1>Genk chief confirms Liverpool interest in Sander Berge transfer</h1>
      <h2>Sander Berge has been publicly praised by Jurgen Klopp in the past - and Genk's sporting director fuelled speculation he is likely to leave the club whilst confirming Liverpool are interested</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:18:52+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are interested in Genk youngster Sander Berge, according to his boss.</p>
      <p>The highly-rated Belgian impressed Jurgen Klopp in their two Champions League group stage games against the Reds last month.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has also attracted interest from Napoli, with reports he could leave Genk for a fee of around £18million.</p>
      <p>And sporting director Dimitri De Conde has appeared to fuel speculation Berge could leave the club as he confirmed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> "follow him carefully" as they consider hijacking Napoli's move.</p>
      <p>De Conde told Radio Punto Nuovo: “If Napoli has already blocked Berge? I read it and it’s not like that. Napoli are interested in Sander and it’s is a possibility.</p>

      <p>“We also know Liverpool follow him carefully. Klopp spoke to the boy after the Anfield game, congratulating him on the performance.</p>
      <p>“In Italy there are clubs that follow Berge and Napoli could be one of these, but to date we have no concrete offers on the table. It could even change in the coming weeks.”</p>
      <p>Berge is contracted to Genk until 2021 and De Condé stressed his side will try to hold on to the player until the end of this season.</p>
      <p>“Berge to Napoli in January? We don’t know. We are currently fighting for our seasonal goals and we are in a complicated situation,” the Genk chief explained.</p>

      <p>“Our intention is to hold on to Sander until the end of the season, but we can’t make any predictions. If the big clubs come knocking at our door, we will have to start negotiations, just as the agent has to do.</p>
      <p>“These are situations we can’t predict, we’re focused on our season, hoping to keep Sander until May. Then if a top club like Napoli is serious, we will sit at the same table to negotiate, it is logical.</p>
      <p>“The current valuation of Berge? We do not talk about figures; we do not set a price at the moment. We will see when we find ourselves in a negotiation.”</p>
