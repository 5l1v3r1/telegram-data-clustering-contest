      <p>Police are appealing for information to find her attacker who is described a black woman in her 20s.</p>
      <p>She had braided shoulder length hair and was wearing dark clothing, a waist-length overcoat and black trainers with white soles.</p>
      <p>She was carrying a large dark green bag and has a distinctive walk with her right foot facing outwards</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Mark Astbury, from Greater Manchester Police, said: “This was a brutal and unprovoked attack and we are currently treating it as a case of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>“Undoubtedly this will cause concern among the local community and residents, but I want to stress that we are doing everything in our power to trace the woman responsible.</p>
      <p>"This is a particularly unusual attack in that the victim was subjected to a violent assault within her own home and I must make it clear that we will not tolerate this kind of violence on our streets.</p>
      <p>“The incident happened in the afternoon and as such I would expect that somebody may have seen something.</p>
      <p>"Were you in the area at the time of the incident?</p>
      <p>"Did you see anything that didn’t seem quite right? If so, please get in touch as a matter of urgency as even the smallest detail could prove absolutely vital whilst we continue our investigation.”</p>
