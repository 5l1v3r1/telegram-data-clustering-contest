      <h1>Germany OKs law on mandatory measles vaccination</h1>
      <h2>The law is set to come into force in March 2020, but concerns remain over the enforcement of the mandatory vaccine.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:43:14+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:43</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Furlong</a></address>
      <p>German lawmakers Thursday approved a law that makes it mandatory for children attending kindergarten and elementary school to be vaccinated against measles. Parents and schools that refuse to comply face potential fines of up to €2,500.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Jens Spahn, who proposed the law, said measles are “too often underestimated” and endanger children who are unable to protect themselves.</p>
      <p>Compulsory vaccination will also apply to teachers, asylum seekers and refugees in public housing, as well as employees working there. Health insurers will be obliged to enter into agreements with the country's health service to reimburse the cost of vaccination carried out in schools.</p>
      <p>The only party to vote against the law was the far-right Alternative for Germany, while the Greens and some members of the Left Party abstained, according to the <a href="https://www.aerztezeitung.de/Politik/Masern-Impfpflicht-ist-Kinderschutz-403904.html">German Press Agency.</a></p>
      <p>The law is set to come into force in March 2020, but<a href="https://www.politico.eu/pro/germany-grapples-with-mandatory-measles-vaccination-rules/"> concerns remain over the enforcement</a> of the mandatory vaccine.</p>
      <p>Some supporters have expressed fears that anti-vaxxers could fake medical records. Other questions remain about how Germany's obligatory school attendance requirements would play out in cases when a parent refused to vaccinate their child.</p>

        <i>CORRECTION: This story was updated to clarify that only refugees and asylum seekers that are in public housing fall under the new law.</i>
