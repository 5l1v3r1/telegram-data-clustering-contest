      <p>It's one of those shops whose prices often have to be seen to be believed and there will soon be more bargains to be had when Heron Foods opens a new store on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>There is already a number of popular branches of Heron in the region, in the likes of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> , Kenton and even in Newcastle city centre but there will soon be another one to go wild in the aisles in.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, November 21 Heron will open a new store at Newbiggin Lane in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/westerhope">Westerhope</a> with the promise of 'top quality products at low prices'.</p>
      <p>If you've ever shopped at Heron, you'll know that there are plenty of cracking deals to take advantage of from crisps and drinks to frozen foods, so it should be exactly the same in Westerhope.</p>
      <p>A glance at Heron's Facebook page reveals current deals include its party food range, available in store from £1.50; five packs of McVitie's Unicorn Cakes for 59p; 3 Bisto and Sharwood’s ready meals for £3 including Cottage Pie and Chicken Tikka Masala and Old El Paso Extra Mild Enchilada Kit for only £1.</p>
      <p>And with Christmas on the way, there'll only be more tempting offers to come!</p>
