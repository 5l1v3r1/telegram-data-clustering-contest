      <h1>Free money is better than any early Black Friday sale, and Amazon is giving away $15</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:40:25+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday 2019 is right around the corner and there are going to be some truly crazy sales this year. In fact, there are already a ton of great <a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday?tag=b0c55-20">early Black Friday deals available right now on Amazon</a> and elsewhere. But no matter how good a Black Friday deal is, and no matter how deep a discount is, there’s one offer that will always be better: Free money.</p>
      <p>That’s right, BGR Deals readers, Amazon is giving away free money and you’re positively insane if you don’t accept it — as long as you’re eligible, that is. Here’s how this awesome promotion works: head to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=gc_10p50_vc_hi_nov?ascsubtag=837997d8f3270d04d1c8f7d937dc57f58328bad6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;node=11158618011&amp;tag=b0c55-20"><b>this page</b></a> on the Amazon site and click the button to add the promotion to your account. Then buy $50 worth of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU/?ascsubtag=b135a7b03a7a12a4bc54c6f3ab26f5cd7bbe1b01&amp;tag=b0c55-20"><b>Amazon gift cards</b></a> and you’ll get a $15 credit on your account within a couple of days. That’s all there is to it! After you buy it, add the $50 gift card balance to your own account since you’ll obviously spend that money on Amazon during the Black Friday blowout anyway, and you’ll end up with $65. The one catch is that the promo is available only to people who have never purchased Amazon gift cards before <b>on the Amazon website</b>. We made that last part bold because you can still take advantage of the promotion if you’ve purchased physical Amazon gift cards in a store, just not if you bought them online from Amazon.</p>
      <p>The coupon code 19GIFTCARD is also supposed to work for this offer, but people have had much better luck with the first method. Go to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=gc_10p50_vc_hi_nov?ascsubtag=837997d8f3270d04d1c8f7d937dc57f58328bad6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;node=11158618011&amp;tag=b0c55-20"><b>the promo page</b></a>, click the button, and then buy at least $50 worth of virtual <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU/?ascsubtag=b135a7b03a7a12a4bc54c6f3ab26f5cd7bbe1b01&amp;tag=b0c55-20">Amazon gift cards</a></b> (or physical cards if you want to give them as gifts). Now before you even ask, if you don’t see a button on that page to add the promo to your account, it means you’re not eligible, most likely because you’ve already purchased gift cards from Amazon in the past.</p>
