      <p>Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, will cut a tenth of all its manager-level workers across the globe, in a bid to slash €1.4bn worth of personnel costs.</p>
      <p>The German manufacturer said this morning the cuts came as its profit would fall significantly over the next two years because of the shift to electric vehicles.</p>

      <p>Chief executive Ola Kallenius said: “The expenditure needed to achieve the [EU’s] CO2 targets require comprehensive measures to increase efficiency in all areas of our company.” </p>
      <p>Kallenius, who took over at the firm in May, added: “The industry is in transformation.”</p>
      <p>“We have to do this.”</p>
      <p>Daimler and its peers are scrambling to reduce their overall carbon emissions, ahead of strict EU rules which come in next year.</p>
      <p>Failure to meet the requirements could result in billions of euros-worth of fines from the EU. Daimler has already warned on profit several times last year, and has spent more than €500m as it gets up to speed on electrification.</p>
      <p>It also agreed to pay an €870m fine over claims that nearly 700,000 failed to meet emissions rules.</p>
      <p>This morning, Kallenius said restructuring plans would include a limit on investment and research at Mercedes, as well as job cuts.</p>
      <p>“This can get quite emotional, but there are no two ways about it,” he said.</p>

      <p>Last week, the firm told German employees it was to cut 1,100 managers globally.</p>
      <p>Shares fell nearly five per cent this morning, before recovering to 2.9 per cent down, valued at about €52.</p>
