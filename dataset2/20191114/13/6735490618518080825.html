      <p>“We talked so much about it being this female empowerment film but were really proud of how Kristoph [Jonathan Groff] is portrayed and the kind of role model that he’s become,” Menzel, who voices Elsa, explained. “He’s this more emotional, expressive man.”</p>
      <p>Bell, who is behind the character Anna, continued, “In his song, which you just don’t see very often, he’s got all these huge emotions and I feel like, as far as a representation for young boys to go like, ‘Yeah, you have all these huge emotions and it’s okay to have them.’”</p>

      <p>“And he’s the one pining over the woman, actually,” Menzel said, “which is a really cool change.”</p>
      <p>Bell added, “Then in the beginning of his song, which is called ‘Lost In The Woods’, he’s singing about all these big things and it says, ‘You feel your feelings and your feelings are real,’ and it’s just the tiny encapsulated way to say, ‘Yeah, it’s okay to have big feelings even if you’re a guy.’”</p>
      <p>“He rescues her in the midst of a battle and the first thing he says to her is, ‘I’m here. What do you need?’”</p>
      <p>“Frozen 2” hits big screens Nov. 22.</p>
