      <p>DEMAREST, N.J. — A New Jersey woman has sued a country club for US$30,000 after a waiter spilled wine on her luxury handbag.</p>
      <p>The Alpine Country Club, in turn, is suing the waiter.</p>
      <p>Maryana Beyder says in a lawsuit filed Oct. 29 that she was dining at the country club in Demarest in September 2018 when a waiter spilled red wine on her rare Hermes handbag, ruining it. Last week, Alpine Country Club sued its own employee.</p>
      <p>Alexandra Errico, Beyder’s attorney, tells NorthJersey.com that the country club is trying to make the employee liable for the damage. She says the country club is “acting in bad faith.”</p>
      <p>The country club’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
