        <b>Newcastle captain <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/jamaal-lascelles">Jamaal Lascelles</a> will not play again until the new year due to a knee injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lascelles was hurt during a tussle with Callum Wilson during the win over Bournemouth on Saturday and was replaced by Paul Dummett after just 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have now had time to assess the injury and have determined the 26-year-old will miss at least six weeks of football.</p>
      <p>Lascelles has been an ever present in Newcastleâ€™s Premier League side under Steve Bruce, starting all 12 games, but now leaves a considerable hole in the back line.</p>
      <p>Dummett is on hand to deputise, while fellow central defenders Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune are closing in on returns from injury.</p>
      <p>Newcastle sit 13th in the table after back-to-back victories over the Cherries and West Ham, with a trip to Aston Villa on November 25 their first match without Lascelles.</p>
