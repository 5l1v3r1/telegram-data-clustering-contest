      <p>SYDNEY: Australia announced measures to combat foreign interference at its universities Thursday (Nov 14), setting new guidelines around the key areas of research collaboration, cybersecurity, and international partnerships.</p>
      <p>There has been growing concern about China's clout on campuses following a series of hacks, controversial donations and incidents of political intimidation linked to Beijing.</p>

      <p>The new guidelines push universities to enhance their cybersecurity systems, undertake due diligence before signing partnerships with overseas organisations, and train staff to recognise foreign influence attempts.</p>
      <p>Academics are urged to be wary of sharing knowledge on sensitive topics and discern how joint research with international scholars could potentially be misused.</p>
      <p>Education Minister Dan Tehan said the guidelines were designed to "ensure universities understand the risks and know what steps to take to protect themselves".</p>
      <p>It comes after Australia established a task force in August to help protect sensitive research, cyber-defences, and free speech.</p>
      <p>Schools and government officials - including spy agencies - have also committed to more intensive consultation to protect Australia's national interests.</p>
      <p>The changes follow a data breach at the Australian National University last year that exposed sensitive staff and student data going back two decades.</p>
      <p>The country's universities have also taken tens of millions of dollars from Beijing to establish "Confucius Institute" branches - similar to Germany's Goethe-Institut and France's Alliance Francaise - that steer clear of issues damaging to China's ruling Communist Party.</p>
      <p>Beijing denies interfering in campus life.</p>
      <p>Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday that allegations of "Chinese infiltration" in Australian institutions were "pure nonsense".</p>
      <p>Geng said at a regular press briefing that China hopes Australia will "uphold the principles of fairness, transparency and non-discrimination", and "avoid politicizing normal exchange programmes".</p>
      <p>Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology vice-chancellor Martin Bean, who worked on developing the new guidelines, said they would "assist decision makers in continuing to assess the evolving risks from foreign interference".</p>
      <p>Deborah Terry, chair of lobby group Universities Australia, said higher education institutions had worked closely with the government throughout the process.</p>
      <p>"Our shared aim is to build on existing protections against foreign interference, without damaging the openness and global engagement that are essential to Australia's success," she said.</p>
      <p>"The intent is not to add to the regulatory or compliance burden for universities, nor to contravene university autonomy - but to enhance resources and intelligence to further safeguard our people, research and technology."</p>
