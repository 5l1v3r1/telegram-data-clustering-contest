      <h1>EFCC seeks court order for separate trial for Dasuki, co-defendants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:45:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Thursday told an FCT High Court that the agency will seek a court order for a separate trial for former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd) different from his seven other defendants.</p>
      <p>Dasuki is being tried in two separate cases alongside other defendants before Justice Hussein Baba-Yusuf by EFCC since 2015 on alleged misappropriation of the fund made for the purchase of arms.</p>
      <p>At the resumed sitting in case FCT/HC/CR/43/2015, EFCC counsel, Mr Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, expressed frustration over the continued absence of Dasuki, who is the first defendant in the case.</p>
      <p>He informed the court that the prosecution had filed a motion dated November 4, seeking the continuation of trial in Dasuki’s absence, adding that the prosecution was served with a counter-affidavit this morning.</p>
      <p>Jacobs, however, said that the best thing to do in the present circumstance was the unbundling of the case so that Dasuki would be separated from other defendants.</p>
      <p>He said, “We can’t be in the same place for four years without moving.”</p>
      <p>He, therefore, told the court that the charge against the defendants might be amended to remove Dasuki’s name to enable other defendants to face their trial without further delays.</p>
      <p>He said that he would file separates charge against other defendants in both cases in which Dasuki is involved before the court and sought an adjournment to do so.</p>
      <p>Responding to this, counsel for Baba-Kusa, Mr Solomon Umoh, SAN, submitted that what the Jacobs was suggesting did not have any place in the book.</p>
      <p>Umoh, said Dasuki is central to the charge against other defendants, adding that, “If he is separated, how can we get a fair hearing?”</p>
      <p>Justice Baba-Yusuf, however, gave an open adjournment and asked the prosecution to file the amendment and serve same on the defendants for them to come to court and take fresh pleas.</p>
