      <h1>Jabra's Elite 75t true wireless earbuds are available now for $180</h1>
      <h2>They're smaller, longer-lasting and cost less than expected.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:50:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>It took longer than expected, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/05/jabra-elite-75t-true-wireless-earbuds/">Jabra's Elite 75t</a> is here -- and with a small upside for patent would-be buyers. The true wireless earbuds will be available today for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=3a52a288c228fc515c3c5d1de5e50a37&amp;creativeASIN=B07X9VG6ZJ">$180</a>, a slight drop from the originally quoted $200, through Amazon, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/jabra-elite-75t-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-titanium-black/6376040.p?skuId=6376040">Best Buy</a> and Jabra's own <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-75t">website</a>. Given that the earlier <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/18/most-versatile-headphones-jabra-elite-65t/">Elite 65t</a> officially sells for $170, that makes the 75t a safe pick unless you can find a steep discount on the older buds.</p>
      <p>The 75t isn't a complete overhaul, but there are some very tangible improvements. The buds are about 20 percent smaller, which can improve comfort, but the biggest improvement is a 50 percent jump in battery life. You should get 7.5 hours on a charge, and the battery case will give you a total of 28 hours of listening time. That could make all the difference if you're determined to keep the music going through a workday or a long flight.</p>
