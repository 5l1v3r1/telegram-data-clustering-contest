      <h1>Student body president at University of Florida is facing impeachment proceedings over payments to Donald Trump Jr</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:15:17+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/thomdunn" target="_blank">Thom Dunn</a></address>
      <p>Because fiction, satire, and reality are all one big intertwined clusterfuck these days, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/university-florida-trump.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytnational"><i>New York Times</i></a> has reported the following:</p>
      <blockquote>Student representatives at the University of Florida introduced a bill on Tuesday to impeach Michael Murphy, the student body president, accusing him of improperly using student fees to pay one of President Trump’s sons to speak on campus.<br/><br/>It all began when Mr. Murphy, a senior, invited Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host and adviser to the president’s campaign, to speak on campus and paid them $50,000 with university funds. Some students say the payment was a violation of the Student Senate code — and possibly the law.</blockquote>
      <p>So the president (of the student body at a college) is facing impeachment because he took money from other people against their will to enrich the Trump family. What do you a call an SEO wet dream when it's actually a nightmare?</p>
      <p>This is a pretty major upgrade in the ongoing right-wing crusade to de-legitimize higher education across the country. But I do have to admit: stealing $50,000 from your fellow students and using it to get yourself in good graces with the Trumps is <i>exactly</i> the kind of slimey move a Trump would pull. So in that case, good on you, Mr. Murphy, for really putting in the work to achieve your lifelong dreams of corrupt scumbaghood. I salute you with this one finger.</p>
