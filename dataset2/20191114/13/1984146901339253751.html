      <p>Most hotly anticipated, though, was the return of the Festive Bake - a firm favourite with fans.</p>

      <p>And whether you're a longstanding lover of the Festive Bake or yet to try it, now Vodafone has come up a fantastic freebie, which means you won't need to pay a penny to get your teeth into one.</p>
      <p>The offer is open until 11.59pm on Thursday, so if you want to make the most of it you're better off acting sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>To redeem your free Festive Bake you'll need to take the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the  <a href="https://fave.co/2KfIq9n">My Vodafone App</a>  (or make sure you have the most recently updated version if you already have it)</li>
        <li>Click on the 'VeryMe' button - this will bring up a list of available offers where you'll see the Greggs deal. Click on that one.</li>
        <li>Head to the closest Greggs to you and when you're there (make sure you wait until you're in store and don't do this beforehand), click the 'Get Deal' button. Once you've activated this you'll only have one hour to use it.</li>
        <li>Order your bake and show your unique code at the till.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious Festive Bake!</li>
