      <h3>Prince Albert’s city council is moving toward bringing the city’s licence renewal fee for cannabis retail shops closer to the rate established in Saskatoon earlier this year.</h3>
      <p>For 2019, the renewal fee was set at $20,000, but for future years, the cost is expected to be established at $100. On Tuesday evening, council gave the bylaw governing the licence fee structure its first and second reading. A third reading is expected on Dec. 9.</p>

        <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/council-votes-to-reduce-cannabis-store-licensing-fee-from-10000-to-85">Once it passes, Prince Albert would follow a similar move made in Saskatoon, which drastically cut its renewal fee for cannabis shop licences from $10,000 to $85.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The City of Prince Albert’s administration recommended a lower fee for 2020 onward, saying in a report to council that the opening of two cannabis retail stores had “little to no impact” on calls for service to city police. The cost of administering business licences for cannabis shops doesn’t vary significantly from other types of business licences, the report added.</p>
      <p>When Prince Albert’s city council approved the cannabis licence bylaw last year, it didn’t establish a renewal fee for retailers after 2020.</p>
      <p>The cost for a new cannabis retail licence will remain at $20,000.</p>
      <p>The administration projects that after 2020, the city’s annual revenue from cannabis store licences will fall to $200 from $40,000.</p>
