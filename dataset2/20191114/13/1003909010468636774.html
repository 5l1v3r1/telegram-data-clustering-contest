      <h1>Preview: Waitress serves up sentimental story of finding oneself</h1>

      <p>Working on the Broadway musical Waitress taught filmmaker-turned-playwright Jessie Nelson the appeal of pies.</p>
      <p>“Before Waitress, I was a cake person but my experience with the musical made me see the beauty of pies,” says Nelson, whose impressive filmography includes such movies as Corina, Corina, I Am Sam, Stepmom, The Story of Us, Danny Collins and Love the Coopers.</p>
      <p>Waitress, which runs at the Jubilee Auditorium Nov. 19 to 24, is the story of Jenna Hunterson, a young woman who sees a pie-making contest as her last hope of escaping an abusive husband and dead-end life. It is based on the 2007 indie hit film starring Keri Russell.</p>
      <p>Tony Award-winning producers Barry and Fran Weissler secured the stage rights to Waitress in 2007 and announced at the 2013 Tony Awards that they were working on a musical version which eventually opened on Broadway in 2016 with music and lyrics by Sara Bareilles and direction by Diane Paulus.</p>
      <p>Nelson recalls she was not the Weisslers’ first choice to write the book for their musical.</p>
      <p>“Four other writers worked on an adaptation but the Weisslers didn’t feel they were the right fit for the material. I had never written a stage musical, but had told my agent it was something I really wanted to do. He told me to pitch my ideas to Barry, Fran, Sara and Diane. I’ve never seen those other drafts so I have no idea what the approaches were but I certainly knew a great deal about the film,” says Nelson, who explains it was her daughter who turned her onto the beautiful whimsy of Waitress.</p>
      <p>“My daughter was 12 when she saw the movie. She adored it. She and her friends would watch it endlessly. I was intrigued to discover why these young people loved the story so much. I wanted to know what made it special so I began watching it through their eyes.</p>
      <p>“I quickly learned how relatable the story and characters are. It really doesn’t matter what age you are to understand what it’s like to let others make you shrink a bit and to lose your dream. Waitress is all about reclaiming who you knew you were meant to be.”</p>
      <p>Nelson had to look no further than her youth to get in touch with the character Jenna and her fellow waitresses Becky and Dawn at Joe’s Diner.</p>
      <p>“I was a waitress from 18 to my mid 20s. It was the way I supported myself while I was pursuing a writing and acting career. There is such a team spirit when you’re a waitress. You get so close because you spend so much of your day with these new friends. You form genuine relationships. I learned how to tell who were career waitresses and who, like me, were using the job as a springboard.</p>
      <p>“I love these characters, even Jenna’s abusive husband Earl because I understand them. They are all so real to me.”</p>
      <p>Nelson says she feels blessed to have met and worked with songstress and composer Sara Bareilles.</p>
      <p>“One of the great appeals of the film Waitress was its indie charm and Sara’s songs capture all those emotions in the story. She is a real poet. Her lyrics are soulful, honest and filled with both pathos and joy. She speaks from her heart and her melodies stay with you.</p>
      <p>“We are living in such a cynical time, yet her music radiates with such beauty and joy.”</p>
      <p>Nelson and Bareilles have just collaborated on a TV series called Little Voice for Apple TV which Nelson describes as “the journey of a young singer/songwriter loosely based on Sara’s life. I’m in the process of editing it now.”</p>
      <p>Nelson says the joy of writing a play or musical as opposed to making a film is that with film there is only one interpretation. “In theatre you get to see your characters interpreted by many actors and many different musicians, which means the colours are forever changing. It’s always a new, developing experience.”</p>
      <p>Nelson says she loves that Waitress is on tour because “when a play sits in New York or London, people come to you, but when you go on tour, you are going to the people and it is a whole different, exciting experience.”</p>
      <p>Waitress has toured to places like Buenos Aries, the Philippines, Japan, Australia and China which, as Nelson points out, are places that often don’t have pie as part of their culture.</p>
