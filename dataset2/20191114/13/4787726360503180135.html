      <h3>Devin Townsend: "KK Downing was probably the biggest influence for me because it was all out of tune"</h3>

        <b>There are a number of known things in the universe and one is that there is no such thing as a bad Devin Townsend interview. And he's on particularly excellent form in a new chat with our friends over on </b>

        <b> – including his reflections on the mighty Judas Priest, namely the influence of their former guitarist KK Downing on Priest's classic 1979 Unleashed In The East live album.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I was just on the treadmill a couple of minutes back, and decided to listen to old Judas Priest," he tells MusicRadar contributor <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/author/jonathan-horsley">Jonathan Horsley</a>. "It’s been years. When I was a kid I just loved that band. I mean the really old ‘70s version of the band.</p>
      <p>"And I realized when I was listening – I was listening to Unleashed in the East – and KK Downing was probably the biggest influence for me because it was all out of tune. And I don’t mean out of tune in that his chords were out of tune; it was the random guitar solos with the whammy bar that was totally out of tune."</p>
      <p>And Devin specified how that had impacted his own playing approach… </p>

      <p>“It was microtonal, whammy bar oddness, and I realise as I am playing now, I love that microtonal thing, even though in my world, and in my work, it’s gotten more progressive or orchestral, but that out-of-the-box tonality is something that I just love, and so, when I solo now I always go to that.</p>
      <p>"I’ll be in the box for a couple of seconds and then I just wanna find those notes that are messed up, and then make them more messed up... And then put a ton of echo on them so it sounds deliberate! [Laughs]”</p>
