      <p>A suicidal tenant has been jailed for putting his neighbours' lives at risk by deliberately starting a fire in his bedsit.</p>
      <p>Miles Gaskin was trying to take his own life when he rolled up bedding, paper and tissues and set light to it at the ground floor flat in Cullompton.</p>
      <p>At least one other tenant had to flee from the buildings and the fire caused £15,000 damage as well as causing massive disruption to the centre of the town.</p>
      <p>Firefighters evacuated a dentist's surgery and dog grooming parlour in adjoining buildings and traffic jams caused by the closure of the High Street spread onto the M5.</p>

      <p>Gaskin had been jilted by his girlfriend in a text message on the morning of September 2 this year. He was already suffering from depression and brooded on his rejection for five hours before starting the fire.</p>
      <p>He changed his mind about taking his own life as the fire spread and he fled the burning house to raise the alarm at the nearby Market House Inn.</p>
      <p>Regulars drinking at around 4 pm did not believe him at first when he said his bed was on fire but he went back ten minutes later shouting for them to call the fire brigade.</p>
      <p>Gaskin remained outside the burning building as firefighters arrived and when he was asked if anyone was still inside he replied 'I don't care'.</p>

      <p>He sat on a wall and told members of the public he had lit the fire but when police approached him, he became abusive and flicked a lit cigarette which landed on the uniform of a community support officer.</p>
      <p>Gaskin, aged 30, of High Street, Cullompton, also admitted arson being reckless whether life was endangered and assaulting an emergency worker.</p>
      <p>He appeared in the dock with a Mohican haircut and shouted abuse at the judge as he was being led away to start his sentence.</p>
      <p>He was jailed for three years and four months by Judge Timothy Rose at Exeter Crown Court.</p>
      <p>The judge told him:"I am told that your intention was to consider taking your own life because of depression and events earlier that day when you received a text from your partner indicating she did not want to continue the relationship.</p>
      <p>"What you did was exceptionally dangerous. Whatever you thought about wanting to harm yourself, you went about it in a way that caused great harm to other people and risked even greater harm. This was a very serious example of this type of offence."</p>
      <p>Miss Rachel Drake, prosecuting, said Gaskin received a text from his partner at 11.15 am on the day of the fire and lit it shortly before 4 pm by applying a lighter to rolled up bedding and tissues.</p>

      <p>He went to the  nearby pub twice and on the second occasion he shouted for them to call the fire brigade. Customers went to check the house and saw flames inside the front ground floor window.</p>
      <p>A bus driver who stopped to help saw a young female tenant from one of the other flats coming out of the smoke filled building but nobody was hurt.</p>
      <p>The shops on either side were evacuated and the dentist had to remained closed until the next afternoon as smoke damage was repaired.</p>
      <p>Gaskin remained outside and told a fire officer he had lit the fire but did not care if anyone remained inside. He became abusive when police arrived and was arrested after flicking his cigarette and the female PCSO.</p>
      <p>Firefighters used a hammer to smash their way in through the front window of his room, which was totally gutted. The tenants in neighbouring rooms all had to be rehoused and the landlord estimated the cost of repairs at between £10,000 and £15,000, not including the loss of rental income.</p>
      <p>Mr Stephen Nunn, defending, said Gaskin was suffering from poor mental health at the time and his depression had been made worse by the message from his partner.</p>
      <p>He said Gaskin had not intended to harm anyone else and had raised the alarm as soon as he realised the fire had got out of hand. The good fire precautions at the building had ensured that nobody else was harmed.</p>
