      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In morning, we <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/bitcoin-btc-price-poised-for-declines-unless-it-breaks-9k/">discussed the chances of a downward move</a> in bitcoin below the $8,660 support against the US Dollar. BTC followed a bearish angle and traded below the $8,700 and $8,660 support levels.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there was a close below the $8,660 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, morning’s short term breakout pattern was breached with support near $8,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>The pair retested the $8,560 support area and it is currently consolidating losses. An immediate resistance is near the $8.610 level. It represents the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $8,785 high to $8,557 low.</p>
      <p>The first main resistance on the upside is near the $8,640 level (the previous support area). The next key resistance is near the $8,670 level. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $8,785 high to $8,557 low is near the $8,670 level.</p>
      <p>If there is an upside break above the $8,640 and $8,670 levels, bitcoin price could extend its recovery towards the $8,740 resistance area. Besides, the second crucial hurdle for the bulls is near the $8,740 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a convincing close above the $8,740 level might push the price towards the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/13/bitcoin-btc-price-sighting-downside-thrust-before-higher/">$8,800 and $8,880 resistance levels</a>. On the downside, the main support is near the $8,550 and $8,500 levels.</p>
      <p>If there is a breakdown below the $8,500 support, the price is likely to accelerate its decline towards $8,300 or $8,200. Having said that, any further losses are unlikely considering the importance of the $8,200 support area.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin is trading near the last key support of the current wave near the $8,550 level.
