      <h1>Razer Black Friday offers and deals 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:00:10+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/andyhartup/" target="_blank">Andy Hartup</a></address>
      <p>Many will be hunting down a Razer Black Friday deal in 2019. While the PC peripheral maker is a divisive name in gaming, there's no denying the quality of most of its products, be they gaming headsets, mice, keyboards, or those delightful Razer Blade laptops. With that build level, you often see higher list-prices, which is why events like Black Friday are so important for anyone seeking out a Razer deal. After all, with price-cuts running across most products during the holiday season, you can often pick up a bargain on a slice of PC tech that was otherwise out of reach for you.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Razer Black Friday offers are a regular sighting in the end-of-year sales, and we're expecting 2019 to be exactly the same. There are certain items that will always get hefty discounts, and they are often the most popular pieces of Razer kit. You're guaranteed to get money off the Deathadder Elite, one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-mouse/">best gaming mouse</a> options, and will probably see savings on the Razer Kraken Tournament Edition, which is one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-headset/">best gaming headsets</a>, if you're on a bit of a budget. Similarly, Razer Blade laptops usually see hefty discounts during Black Friday, and the Advanced 2019 model is top of our list of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">best gaming laptops</a>, so you really should consider it if you're in the market for a new slim and light PC.</p>
      <p>We'll list all the Razer Black Friday deals below, as we find them, throughout November and beyond. For a wider range of kit, check out our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday video game deals</a> guide.</p>

      <p>Our guide to all the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-gaming-laptop-deals-2019/">Black Friday gaming laptop</a> deals, and the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-gaming-headset-deals-2019/">Black Friday gaming headset</a> offers.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Razer Black Friday bargains are likely to be found all throughout November and December but, if you want to get factual, then Black Friday itself is 29 November. That's the day after Thanksgiving, as is traditional. While the savings will be good throughout the months leading up to the Holidays, expect to see the biggest discounts on Black Friday itself, or on Cyber Monday (2 December). In fact, if you're looking for a Razer peripheral, like a mouse or headset, you might find the savings better on Cyber Monday as that's when people tend to make impulse purchases after the main Black Friday scrum. These items are relatively inexpensive, and Razer knows it, so they tend to reduce them to decent prices late in the sales period to tempt anyone in search for last-minute gifts.</p>
      <p>Exactly when will the prices start to get lower? We usually see retailers start to slash list-prices about ten days before Black Friday itself. That's good and all but the very best deals will come from Razer itself, and these start on the same week as Black Friday, so we'll be watching them as of Monday, November 25.</p>
      <h3>Money saving tips</h3>
      <p>If you're looking to buy anything from the Razer Black Friday sales, it pays to know what to pick and how best to make sure you're getting a good deal. As we've mentioned, some Razer products can regularly be found to be on offer, so you need to know what is 'a good deal' and what is just 'business as usual' over Black Friday. Here are some tips to help you make the right decision.</p>
      <p><b>1. Use price-tracking sites</b><br/>While we will be picking out the best deals for you, it pays to know exactly how much you're saving on the average price of a product, rather than just the list price. Sure, it may look great to see a mouse for $50, down from $75, but if that same mouse has been averaging $55 for most of the year... the deal seems far less sweet. We use sites like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> to track the price history of a product, so we know when something has hit the lowest ever, or if something is a particularly solid deal. You don't always have to catch something at the lowest possible price for it to be worth buying, but it does feel good to know you've spent as little as possible when it does happen.</p>
      <p><b>2. Know what you want to buy</b><br/>This applies when you're picking up a high-value item, like a laptop. You should have an idea of what spec you want to achieve, and what model you'd want before the sales start. With laptop specs varying quite a lot, you need to be aware of what's absolutely essential in your build, and what is a little more optional. Do you need a 20-series GPU in there? Or is the screen more important? What size SSD do you really need in the laptop, and what can you supplement with an external drive?</p>
      <p><b>3. Spend to your budget</b><br/>The best advice we can give you is to spend to the budget you have in mind for Black Friday. Say you've assigned $120 for a headset: it's better to get a $150 headset for $120, than a $120 headset for $100. Why? While you've already budgeted for the money, and are comfortable spending it, you'll get more from a more premium headset than a cheaper one. You'll feel better about having that superior product than you will by saving $20 on a not-quite-as-good model. So, our advice is: be realistic about how much you want to spend, and either spend all of it or push yourself slightly higher to get something even better than you ever thought you could afford. Future you will thank you for it.</p>
