      <h1>John Lewis Christmas Advert LIVE: Latest reactions to the 2019 ad with Excitable Edgar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:39:08+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/TheSunMoney/</a></address>

        <b>THE <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10336522/john-lewis-christmas-advert-live/">John Lewis Christmas advert</a> is here!</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the first time, it is a joint-effort with its sister retailer Waitrose.</p>
      <p>It features the heart-warming tale of Excitable Edgar a dragon who loves Christmas but nearly ruins it with his fiery breath.</p>
      <p>Last year's John Lewis advert featured Elton John which was hugely popular with fans, and this year it seems as though they have certainly lived up to expectations.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the retail giant released a tease on Twitter called <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10331942/john-lewis-christmas-advert-fans-teaser-trailer/">"Excitable Edgar"</a>. We have everything you need to know about the advert so far with our live blog, including how you can watch it.</p>
