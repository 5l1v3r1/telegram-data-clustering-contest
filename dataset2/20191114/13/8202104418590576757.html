      <h3>Anyone who submits an informal freedom of information request to the City of Prince Albert will have to pay $5 to have the information they seek sent to them by email.</h3>
      <p>Prince Albert’s city council voted Tuesday to approve the addition of this fee to its informal freedom of information and access to information policy.</p>
      <p>Council also approved charging a postage fee on top of its fee for registered mail, and an increase to the cost of a “custom” research and report request from $100 to $150 per hour, plus the cost incurred from a third party, saying the city needs to ensure that staff time and resources for compiling these reports is adequately compensated. These kinds of reports are usually requested by research companies and senior government organizations.</p>
      <p>The city’s policy already included a $5 postage fee for information sent via regular mail and a $5 charge for information sent by fax.</p>
      <p>The amended fee structure applies to the city’s “informal” freedom of information application process, which is separate from the “formal” request process under the Local Authority Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy act. The latter process is governed by provincial laws governing fees, including a $20 application fee, so the city-approved fee structure won’t apply to those requests.</p>
      <p>Under the city’s informal policy, a $5 fee is charged by the department conducting the search and covers one hour of search time. The city then charges $15 for every half-hour of searching after that.</p>
      <p>The informal process can be used to access information that doesn’t contain personally identifiable, sensitive or confidential information.</p>
      <p>Todd McKay, prairie director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, asked why the city would not make the existing formal freedom of information process easier, quicker and less expensive, rather than create a duplicate process.</p>
      <p>He said it’s good the city is thinking of an informal process and not directing people to submit formal FOI applications, but he is unsure “reinventing the wheel” by creating a duplicate system is the best way to go.</p>
      <p>“Why not just make the wheel they’ve got work better?”</p>
