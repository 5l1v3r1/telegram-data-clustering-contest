      <h1>Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe has radical plan for future of EFL Trophy</h1>
      <h2>Lowe enjoys the much-criticised competition but feels one important change could be made</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T13:30:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle manger Ryan Lowe believes League One and League Two clubs should be given the chance to opt out of the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>The competition has come in for much-criticism from fans because of the involvement of Premier League under-21 teams, who are invited to take part each season under the current format.</p>
      <p>Lowe led Bury to the semi-finals of the EFL Trophy last season and hoped for more success in it with Argyle this term.</p>
      <p>However, the Pilgrims missed out on a place in the knockout stages after Bristol Rovers won 1-0 at home to Swindon Town in the final game of Southern Group B on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Lowe believes the strength of sides in the EFL Trophy has been a problem, despite some rules being in place to prevent that.</p>
      <p>He said: “I take every cup competition as serious as I can. I want to win every cup competition.</p>
      <p>“Other people, other managers and other clubs don’t, without going into too much detail.</p>
      <p>“We fulfilled our games with good squads and good players, and players that have played the following game.</p>
      <p>“I think a line needs to be drawn in that department.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “For me, I like the competition. I got to the semi-final of it last year and was half a game away from Wembley.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to do the same this year. Unfortunately, it weren’t to be.</p>
      <p>“I think where the Premier League teams are asked whether they want to come in, they should ask the Football League teams do they want to go out, and see where it goes from there.</p>
      <p>“I think you should only be in it if you want to win it, and there are certainly clubs in it that don’t want to win it or don’t want to get past the group stage.”</p>
      <p>Attendances for EFL Trophy ties continue to be very low in the group stage of the competition, in some cases below 1,000.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s group games at home to Bristol Rovers and Chelsea Under-21s this season were watched by crowds of only 2,518 and 1,725 respectively.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “For me, I would rather play a game in the Leasing.com Trophy than probably play a 11-v-11 behind closed doors, or on the training pitch, whatever it is.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, you do experiment and throw one or two in there to see if they can do it if called upon in a league game, and rightly so.</p>
      <p>“That’s what the competition is for, to breed the youngsters.</p>
      <p>“If the fans are not happy about it I think maybe that’s a case for them to ask the questions and not me.</p>
      <p>“I just get told where to go, where to play and that’s it, pick a team.”</p>
