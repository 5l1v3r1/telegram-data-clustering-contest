      <p>Recently, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/lana-del-rey">Lana Del Rey</a> also covered a classic Joni Mitchell song as she performed ‘For Free’ during her live shows.</p>
      <p>The ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell-review">Norman Fucking Rockwell!</a>‘ singer first covered the track at Vancouver’s Rogers Arena on September 30, before repeating the cover days later at Seattle’s WaMU Theater.</p>

      <p>It originally appeared on Mitchell’s 1970 record ‘Ladies Of The Canyon’, although Del Rey offers a stripped down take – accompanied by a single piano.</p>
      <p><i>“I slept last night in a good hotel, I went shopping today for jewels, the wind rushed around in the dirty town,”</i> Del Rey sings on the track.</p>
      <p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/joni-mitchell-personal-book-release-public2459888-2459888">it was announced that Mitchell was set to release a personal book of lyrics, poetry, and paintings.</a></p>
      <p>The book was originally penned by the iconic singer-songwriter back in 1971. Titled <i>Morning Glory on the Vine</i>, the rare collection of handwritten words was limited to 100 copies and gifted to Mitchell’s close friends.</p>
      <p>Released on October 22, the works are now available to fans for the first time.</p>
      <p>Describing the new version of <i>Morning Glory on the Vine</i>, <a href="http://jonimitchell.com/library/viewmedia.cfm?id=147">a post on Mitchell’s official website</a> read: “In this faithfully reproduced facsimile edition, Joni’s best-loved lyrics and poems spill across the pages in her own elegant script.”</p>
