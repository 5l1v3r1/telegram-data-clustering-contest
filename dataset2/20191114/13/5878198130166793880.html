      <h1>The ritual murders of albinos in parts of Africa: 6 things you need to know about the cultural beliefs</h1>

      <p>One of the most under-discussed subjects on the African continent is the persecution that is tailored towards people living with albinism (PWA).</p>
      <p>The news of the dangers albinos face may often be reported yet the whys associated with the murders of people with a simple congenital disorder are postponed due to fear of challenging cultural beliefs.</p>
      <p>This is rather unfortunate since the UN has identified the problem as having international dimensions.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is the refusal to challenge the cultures and the supposedly harmless jokes about albinos that aid the murders. In order to do these things therefore, there is a need to educate ourselves on some little known facts on the ritual killings of albinos.</p>
