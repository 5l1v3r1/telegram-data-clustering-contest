      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Thibaut_Courtois">Thibaut Courtois</a> has claimed he is one of the world’s best goalkeepers despite coming in for criticism at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a> this season.</p>
      <p>The Belgian’s performance against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paris-saint-germain">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the Champions League was heavily criticised and Courtois was then substituted at half-time after conceding twice against Club Brugge, with rumours emerging that he was struggling with anxiety.</p>
      <p>Yet Courtois has insisted that his form remains good, and that he is one of the world’s best goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>“With my talent and my form, I am certain that I belong among the best,” Courtois told the Belgian media.</p>
      <p>“That is precisely why I have been criticised. </p>
      <p>“I have only conceded seven goals in La Liga so there is nothing wrong with my form.”</p>
      <p>Courtois also expanded on the Club Brugge game, explaining that he was ill, and that the goals were not necessarily his fault.</p>
      <p>“They were two bizarre goals and then I had to go off because I was sick.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t read the papers. As a professional, you only pay attention to what the coach, your team-mates and those who know what it is like to be a goalkeeper say.</p>
      <p>“To criticise someone for letting in a goal is very easy, but I’ve remained calm and done my work at training.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never doubted my ability. To lose my self-confidence would be the biggest mistake I could make. You go downhill from there.</p>
      <p>“The pressure belongs at a clubs like Real and I don’t have a problem with that. At [former clubs] Chelsea, at Atletico and now at Real, you have to achieve.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/belgium-football">Belgium</a> have already qualified for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> having won every game in Group I.</p>
      <p>They face Russia in St Petersburg on Saturday.</p>
