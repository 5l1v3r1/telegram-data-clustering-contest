      <h1>Facebook expands donation options with new Instagram button and more</h1>
      <h2>The social network also expanded its Facebook Gaming fundraising options</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:44:14+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/jonathan-lamont" target="_blank">Jonathan Lamont</a></address>
      <p>Facebook is expanding options for people to donate through its various platforms. This includes a new dedicated donation button in Instagram, a donate sticker for Facebook Stories and a broader rollout of fundraising for Facebook Gaming.</p>
      <p>Likely, the new Instagram button will be the most important new tool. It enables nonprofit businesses to add a donation button to their Instagram profile. It appears next to where the company lists its phone number. Most importantly, the new button is a permanent addition, unlike the donate button available in Instagram Stories, which vanish after 24 hours.</p>
      <p>That Instagram Stories button will now make its way to Facebook Stories as well.</p>
      <p>Finally, Facebook will now allow Level Up gamers in regions where fundraising tools are available to use charity gaming tools. This includes Canada, but you can find a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/837523116348786">full list of countries here</a>.</p>

      <p>Gamers will be able to select a cause, request viewers donate money as they watch the game live and set a goal amount. Plus, notifications will pop-up in the chat when people donate, allowing the streamer to shout out donators.</p>
      <p>While none of these changes will revolutionize Facebook’s donation system, they will put donation options in front of more people, which should make it easier for nonprofits to collect donations.</p>
