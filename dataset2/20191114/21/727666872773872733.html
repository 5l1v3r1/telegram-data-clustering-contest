      <h1>Kodak Black Did What With A Handful Of Nuts?</h1>

      <p>Kodak Black had a handful of nuts and we don't mean Planters!</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors)</b> Kodak Black is the man of the hour! I don't know why, but he's just doing the most even though he has been sentenced to jail time for 46 months. That's almost four years of time in jail. I don't know about y'all, but I don't have any time to waste on this Earth! I know you can make that time productive, but it ain't for me! At any rate, this is where he is. But I have to give him some props for not succumbing to depression! He continues to be quite amusing!</p>
      <p>Last month, he got into a prison fight as he approached sentencing. In the midst of the fracas, he decided to grab the testicles of a prison guard that was attempting to bring order to the matter. Now, this is no laughing matter, especially if you are a man. Kodak reportedly grabbed his balls so hard that “his abdomen and intestinal wall were breached.” WTF! He hit that same guard two times and required a total of four to get him under control. Now, I am thinking he was lucky to only get four years or so in the bing. I wonder if they punish him for that in those four years. </p>
      <p>The judge and Kodak had an interesting interaction before sending him off. The Judge said: </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Young people do stupid things. But the problem is that you’ve been doing stupid things since you were 15.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Kodak took it on the chin:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m sorry for the actions that led me for where I’m standing. I do take full responsibility for my mishap.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>I will say this, there is a reason this dude is able to maintain a fanbase despite his crazy life. He really is uncompromisingly HIMSELF.</p>
      <p>#FreeKodak was trending. Kodak said, "#FreeMe." YUP.</p>
