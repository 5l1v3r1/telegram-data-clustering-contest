      <p>Jadon Sancho was the man trusted to replace the dropped Raheem Sterling for England’s 1,000th game.</p>
      <p>The Borussia Dortmund winger played as part of a front three with Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford as the Three Lions booked their spot at Euro 2020 with victory over Montenegro at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency takes a closer look at his performance.</p>

      <p>It looked for a long period that, on a night where England peppered their visitors goal with shots, Sancho was barely going to be a provider of any of them. He had got into plenty of good positions but as the game wore on and, almost exclusively in the second half, he was wasteful, either getting dispossessed or finding an opposition player with a cross. However, he finally put that right in the final 10 minutes when, on the left, he was played in by Ben Chilwell and he put in a perfect ball for Tammy Abraham to score his first senior goal for his country.</p>
