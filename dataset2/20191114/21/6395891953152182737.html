      <p><b>TOLEDO, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Ohio's governor is laying out a broad plan to combat the toxic algae plaguing Lake Erie and says the plan will work but not overnight.</p>
      <p>Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday the state's new strategy will focus on reducing agriculture runoff that feeds the algae by offering farmers financial incentives to change their practices.</p>
      <p>DeWine says the changes won't be mandatory, but he thinks farmers will buy in because of the incentives and some of the new practices that will save them money.</p>
      <p>He says it's the first time the state has taken such a comprehensive approach.</p>
      <p>Ohio lawmakers this summer approved spending $172 million over the next two years on water quality improvements.</p>
      <p>Details about how the money will be spent will be announced in the coming months.</p>
