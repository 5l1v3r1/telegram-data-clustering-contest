      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- A New Jersey man is a two-state lottery winner after winning $150,000 in his home state and $100,000 in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>The winner, identified as Thomas A. of Pitman, told New Jersey Lottery officials it was "just luck" that he decided to buy a High Card Poker scratch-off ticket with a spare $5 he had left over from buying some more expensive lottery tickets.</p>
      <p>Thomas ended up scratching off a $150,000 winner.</p>
      <p>The player said the jackpot wasn't his first brush with lottery luck -- he previously scored $100,000 from a Pennsylvania Lottery scratch-off ticket a few years earlier.</p>
      <p>Thomas said he plans to buy a new car and take a vacation with his winnings.</p>
