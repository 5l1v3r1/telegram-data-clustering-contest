      <p>In the days following the accident, Rebecca penned a lengthy message which she waited two months to share.</p>
      <p>She told how she and Jared were airlifted to hospital from the scene of the crash.</p>
      <p>In a loving manner, she gushed her love was the "strongest" out of the three of them as she reflected on the incident that unfolded on September 1.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Written 9/17/19: First of all, I want you all to know that ultimately, all 3 of us in the car wreck are alive and recovering and that’s what matters the most! It is going to be a long road to recovery but we have the best support team. The scariest part for Jared and I was being separated after both being airlifted to UCLA.</p>
      <p>"Just a lot of rest and physical therapy ahead for both of us! Jared is the strongest person I know and he will get through this. We still have each other and that’s what matters the most. This could’ve had a completely different outcome and we feel so blessed that it was not any worse.</p>
      <p>"From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU for all of the prayers, phone calls, texts and messages. It means the world to us that we feel so much love and support from you all at this time! I will keep you all updated as we embark on this new journey!"</p>
