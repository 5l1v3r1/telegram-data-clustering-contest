      <h1>Parliament finally has a intelligence watchdog</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:59:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jan Gerber</a></address>
      <p>Almost five months after the Sixth Parliament was constituted, it has a committee empowered to keep an eye on South Africa's intelligence agencies.</p>
      <p>In a statement released on Thursday, it was announced that ANC MP Jerome Maake was appointed as the chairperson of the joint standing committee on intelligence (JSCI) on October 30.</p>
      <p>About a month ago, News24 <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/spy-wars-who-watches-the-watchers-parliaments-intelligence-committee-not-yet-functional-20191017">reported</a> that amid controversies surrounding the State Security Agency, the JSCI had yet to start its work, apparently because consultations over who the chairperson should be had not been concluded.</p>
      <p>When the ANC announced who its candidates for committee chairpersons would be in June, Bongiwe Mbingo-Gigaba was considered for the JSCI, but her nomination was not made official as the vetting required for the position was not completed.</p>
      <p>After it emerged that the ANC had nominated a convicted fraudster, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-withdraws-convicted-fraudsters-nomination-to-chair-parliaments-basic-education-committee-20190701">Zukisa Faku</a>, for chairperson of the portfolio committee on basic education, Mbingo-Gigaba was nominated for that position.</p>
      <p>Maake was the ANC's whip in the Fifth Parliament's portfolio committee on police and <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-guns-for-mcbride-what-is-he-is-really-fighting-for-20190225">led the charge</a> against the renewal of Robert McBride's term as head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID).</p>
      <p>The members of the committee were sworn in on Wednesday are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lindiwe Bebee (ANC);</li>
        <li>Dorries Dlakude (deputy chief whip of the ANC);</li>
        <li>Masefako Dikgale (ANC);</li>
        <li>Nombulo Hermans (ANC);</li>
        <li>Bulelani Magwanishe (ANC);</li>
        <li>Kenneth Mmoielang (ANC);</li>
        <li>Jacqueline Mofokeng (ANC);</li>
        <li>Zukiswa Ncitha (ANC);</li>
        <li>Dianne Kohler-Barnard (DA);</li>
        <li>Martha Gondwe (DA);</li>
        <li>Cathlene Labuschagne (DA leader in the National Council of Provinces);</li>
        <li>Mbuyiseni Ndlozi (EFF).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A further swearing-in of members of the JSCI is required, due to the confidentiality of their work.</p>
      <p>It is one of only two bodies that oversee the intelligence services. The other is the Inspector General of Intelligence (IGI) which reports to the committee.</p>
      <p>The committee does its work behind closed doors. </p>
