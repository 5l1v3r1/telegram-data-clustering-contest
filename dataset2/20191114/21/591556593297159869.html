        <b>Nvidia said gaming revenue increased 26% compared to last quarter to $1.66 billion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2020">published</a> better-than-expected third quarter financial results after the bell on Thursday, posting solid sequential gains in its gaming unit. The graphics chip maker reported a net income of $899 million, or $1.45 per share.</p>
      <p>Non-GAAP earnings were $1.78 per share on a revenue of $3.01 billion, down 5% year-over-year but up 17% from last quarter. Wall Street was looking for earnings of $1.57 per share with $2.91 billion in revenue.<br/><br/>Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said revenue in the third quarter was driven by the company's gaming business and demand from hyperscale customers. Hinting at Nvidia's long-term strategy going forward, Huang said Nvidia is looking to expand its reach in markets that will rely on GPU-accelerated servers.<br/><br/>"This quarter, we have laid the foundation for where AI will ultimately make the greatest impact. We extended our reach beyond the cloud, to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT will revolutionize the world's largest industries. We see strong data center growth ahead, driven by the rise of conversational AI and inference."<br/><br/>Nvidia said GPU business revenue was $2.56 billion, down 8% from the year ago period. Breaking down business segments, Nvidia said gaming revenue declined 6% from a year ago to $1.66 billion, but increased 26% compared to last quarter. The company said the sequential increase reflects growth in GeForce desktop and gaming GPUs. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, data center revenue declined 8% year over year $726 million. The company says demand from cloud customers grew during the quarter but that revenue was offset by lower enterprise sales, including for DGX systems.<br/><br/>Revenue from Nvidia's automotive business came to $162 million and its professional visualization segment reached $324 million, up 6%.</p>
      <p>For the current quarter, Wall Street is looking for non-GAAP earnings of $1.70 per share with $3.06 billion in revenue. Nvidia followed up with a Q4 revenue projection of $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%.<br/><br/>Shares of Nvidia were up close to 2% after hours. </p>
