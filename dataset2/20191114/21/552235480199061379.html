      <p>A young woman has told how she was determined to survive her 14-hour rape ordeal at the hands of alleged serial <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sex-crime">sex attacker</a> Joseph McCann.</p>
      <p>McCann, 34, is said to have abducted a 25-year-old woman just a few metres from her home in Walthamstow after midnight on April 25.</p>
      <p>She was the second of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/serial-rapist-held-family-hostage-20876320">McCann's 11 alleged victim</a> whom he is said to have attacked between April 20 and May 5 this year.</p>
      <p>In a recorded <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> interview played at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice">the Old Bailey</a> , she said: "Someone had put their hand over my mouth and told me to stop screaming - he said 'you f***** with my sister'.</p>
      <p>"Before I got into the car I thought I was being mugged. When I got into the car I don't really know what I was thinking, it was so weird.</p>

      <p>"Then, when he stopped, I realised what was happening and I thought he was going to rape me and I thought 'I need to make sure he doesn't kill me'."</p>
      <p>She said he had repeated called her Hayley, echoing evidence given earlier by McCann's first alleged victim.</p>
      <p>She went on: "He dragged me down the road and told me to get in the 'cab'.</p>
      <p>I said no but he pushed me in the car and he told me to strip.</p>
      <p>"I asked him not to do this."</p>
      <p>Over the next 14 hours, McCann allegedly raped her repeatedly, driving her to different parts of north London and into Epping Forest.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: "He asked me lots of things - sometimes he would want me to say something specific.</p>
      <p>He asked me to call him daddy and say I was a child."</p>
      <p>He also tried to make her take him back to her address so he could stab her boyfriend and rape her housemate, the court heard.</p>
      <p>The woman said: "At one point we parked in a country lane and he raped me and then we drove around Hackney and Clapham and Bethnal Green and I still wouldn't say where my house was.</p>
      <p>"When it got light we had driven a long way away. He parked outside a school.</p>
      <p>"He kept saying he needed to find a kid and he was going to make me rape a kid.</p>
      <p>"He was talking, talking, talking all the time - he talked about child marriage and how it was legal in some countries."</p>
      <p>McCann allegedly raped her while they were parked outside the school and threatened to drive to Poland with her.</p>
      <p>The woman said she could not remember how many times she was raped that night because it had been so many.</p>
      <p>He also threatened to throw her into a canal to "wash the DNA" off her, jurors were told.</p>
      <p>At one point he forced her to take out £250 cash and buy him a list of things from a corner shop, including a bottle of vodka.</p>
      <p>The shopkeeper asked her if she was okay but the woman was unable to answer because McCann was standing by the door watching her, the court heard.</p>

      <p>She said: "Maybe three times over 12 hours he stopped and said he was going to kidnap someone we saw but he didn't."</p>
      <p>But just after midday on April 25, McCann allegedly forced a 21-year-old woman into his car in Edgware, north London, while a second woman managed to escape.</p>
      <p>The witness said: "He told the girl not to use her phone or he would slit her throat or drown her."</p>
      <p>McCann allegedly locked both women in the car while he went to buy cocaine, before making the older woman perform sex acts on the 21-year-old.</p>
      <p>"He kept saying he had someone in the police and we would never escape him. He started saying to the girl he was going to kill her."</p>
      <p>The two women eventually managed to escape when the 25-year-old smashed McCann over the head with a vodka bottle, jurors heard.</p>
      <p>McCann, from Harrow, north-west London, denies 37 charges relating to 11 alleged victims aged between 11 and 71.</p>
      <p>He faces 10 counts of false imprisonment, seven counts of rape, one count of rape of a child, and two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.</p>
      <p>He is further charged with seven counts of kidnap, one count of attempted kidnap, three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, three counts of assault by penetration, one count of sexual assault and two counts of committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence.</p>
      <p>The Old Bailey trial, which is expected to last six weeks, continues at 10am on Friday.</p>
