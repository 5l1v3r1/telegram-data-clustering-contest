      <p>Netflix is set to produce a fourth Beverly Hills Cop film, which will see Eddie Murphy reprise his role as maverick detective Axel Foley.</p>
      <p>The streaming giant has bought the rights to the film from Paramount Studios, which dropped its plans for the project in 2016.</p>
      <p>Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first two films, is in line to produce the reboot.</p>
      <p>Murphy starred as the wisecracking Foley in the 1984 original Beverly Hills Cop and then again for its sequels in 1987 and 1994.</p>
      <p>The original saw Murphy's character arriving in Los Angeles trying to solve the mystery of his best friend's murder.</p>
      <p>It was a critical and commercial success and shot Murphy to international acclaim.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old actor and comedian is widely tipped for awards season success for his starring role in Netflix's Dolemite Is My Name.</p>
