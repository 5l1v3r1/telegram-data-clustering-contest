      <h1>Rizal complex facilities ready soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:05:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Atencio</a></address>
      <p>By today (Friday), everything should be in place.</p>
      <p>Work on the rehabilitation and renovation of facilities inside the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in Vito Cruz and at the Philsports Complex in Pasig is expected to be finished before the week is up.</p>
      <p>Philippine Sports Commission Chairman and national team chef de mission William Ramirez said this as he talked on the status of ongoing repair work on facilities that will be used for the 30th Southeast Asian Games.</p>
      <p>“The way I look at it, everything will be in place before the opening,” said Ramirez.</p>
      <p>The contractors tasked to do the work of the six major facilities for the SEA Games have a target date of Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>By this time, the country’s hosting of the games for the fourth time should have no more delays, with still 15 days to go before the opening ceremonies.</p>
      <p>So far, the Rizal Memorial Coliseum, which underwent major rehabilitation for the first since 1953, has reached 90 percent in terms of readiness last week.</p>
      <p>The Ninoy Aquino Stadium, Tennis Center and football stadium need another week and should be ready by Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>The retrofitting, installation of air-conditioning, lights, new chairs, and other new features are expected to have been done by Wednesday.</p>
