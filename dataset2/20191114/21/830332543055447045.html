      <p>GOTHAM, Wis. - Richland County deputies arrested two people on Wednesday for burglarizing a home <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/two-arrested-on-drug-related-charges-following-executed-search-warrant-in-richland-county/1142286267">where a search warrant was executed the day before</a>. </p>
      <p>According to a news release from the Richland County Sheriff's Department, a deputy who was on patrol saw a light that was on inside a home at 28875 McNurlin St. in the village of Gotham at 6:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>The home was not supposed to be occupied, as the residence was the location of a search warrant less than 12 hours before the incident. The deputy also saw a car in the driveway with an open trunk. </p>
      <p>The release said another deputy arrived to help inspect the area. Officials later found someone had made forced entry into the home. It appeared a number of items were moved inside the home, with other items possibly missing. </p>
      <p>During their investigation, deputies found a man and woman behind the home hiding by a yard shed, and both were taken into custody. The two were taken to jail and await bail hearings on several charges. </p>
      <p>Steven Baker, 32, of Boaz, faces charges of burglary using forced entry, theft of property, two counts of obstructing, resisting arrest, trespassing and damage to property.</p>
      <p>Nichole Weiland, 29, of Boaz, faces charges of burglary using forced entry, theft of property, obstructing an officer and trespassing.</p>
      <p>An investigation is ongoing. </p>
