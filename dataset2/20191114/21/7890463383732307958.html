        <b>After over a decade of waiting, a new Age is upon us. After months of hints, Microsoft has finally unveiled Age of Empires 4 with a shiny new gameplay trailer, along with some new details about the return of the classic strategy game. While the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/age-of-empires-4/age-of-empires-4-release-date-trailer-gameplay-nations">Age of Empires 4 release date</a> is still some distance away – nothing confirmed here – there’s plenty here to stoke the fires of your wololo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It looks absolutely fantastic – massive unit counts, beautiful locations, and a wonderful style. It’s set during the medieval era, and the trailer confirmed two factions: the Mongols and the English. It looks like we can expect some notable siege battles as well – or the base-building mechanics have gotten way more advanced than my memories of Age 2 suggest.</p>
      <p>The new studio handling Age of Empires now has a name, too: World’s Edge. The Relic Entertainment logo also appears at the end of the trailer.</p>
      <p>Check out the new trailer below.</p>
