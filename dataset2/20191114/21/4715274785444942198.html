      <p>The PBA Press Corps is inviting Metro Manila schools to join its sportswriting contest, a project the group is reviving on Nov. 22.</p>
      <p>Limited slots are available on a first-come, first-served basis for college and senior high students. Each school is allowed entry of two writers and one photographer.Â </p>
      <p>The innovation of including a photographer for the first time is in line with the 25th anniversary celebration of the competition first held in 1994.</p>
      <p>Participants are required to submit valid school IDs and should be a bonafide member/staff of their respective school publication.</p>
      <p>Cash prizes will be awarded to the winners, while a short seminar will precede the contest proper.</p>
      <p>For further details, please contact Hazel Ancheta of the PBA office (0956-8717835) or Gerry Ramos of the PBAPC (0915-2034869).</p>
