      <p>The <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/ios">iOS</a> 13.2 code signing stoppage arrives a brisk seven days after Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/apple-releases-ios-1322-ipados-1322-with-background-app-quit-bug-fix">pushed out iOS 13.2.2</a> to patch a number of bugs, including an issue that caused background apps to quit unexpectedly. <br/><br/>With the change, users can no longer download iOS 13.2 from Apple servers.<br/><br/>According to release notes accompanying iOS 13.2.2 last Thursday, the update resolves the aforementioned background app problem, cellular service issues, a bug that in some cases caused replies to S/MIME encrypted email messages between Exchange accounts to be unreadable, an issue involving the Kerberos single sign-on service in Safari, and a charging problem related to YubiKey Lightning powered accessories.<br/><br/>Apple regularly ceases code signing to prevent users from installing old iOS versions following the release of a new version, a practice that keeps users safe from new threats and ensures devices are running the latest feature-rich software.<br/><br/>Second beta versions of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/12/second-betas-for-ios-133-ipados-133-tvos-133-watchos-611-out-now">iOS 13.3</a> were released earlier this week, delivering a slate of minor tweaks and fixes to the platform.
