      <h1>Plymouth Argyle's Jose Baxter gamble did not work out but it was worth trying</h1>
      <h2>The 27-year-old midfielder has left the Pilgrims by mutual consent because of injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:28:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:28</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>In the end it did not work out for either Jose Baxter or Plymouth Argyle but it was worth a try.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old midfielder’s stay at Home Park was only a brief one, but even in that short time his technical ability was clear for all to see.</p>
      <p>However, a troublesome calf injury which he could not shake off has led to him leaving <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> by mutual consent.</p>
      <p>The short-term contract which Baxter signed just before the start of the season would have ended in January.</p>
      <p>With no return from his injury in sight, as manager Ryan Lowe revealed during his media call at Home Park on Thursday, parting company now was sadly the sensible option.</p>
      <p>It is a shame because Baxter showed in most of his five starts and seven substitute appearances for Argyle that when fully fit he would be a valuable asset.</p>
      <p>He could never get fully fit, though, after arriving at Home Park so late in pre-season as his calf problem stopped him in his tracks.</p>
      <p>Baxter said: “Because of a recurring calf injury that I have suffered this season, it seemed sensible to come to an agreement with the club so that I and they can both plan for the future.</p>
      <p>“I am very grateful for everyone associated with Argyle for welcoming me with open arms.</p>
      <p>“My stay has been short but memorable and it is a fantastic club with an amazing manager and coaching staff, great people who work behind the scenes and a fantastic Green Army following.</p>
      <p>“I wish everyone at the club all the success in the world.”</p>
      <p>Baxter, who burst onto the football scene as a teenage talent with Everton in the Premier League, has had well-documented off-the-pitch issues over recent years.</p>
      <p>They have included two failed drugs tests and also having to deal with his mental health.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Lowe was a huge admirer of the ability of Baxter and ready to give him a chance at Argyle.</p>
      <p>It was a low-risk gamble on Lowe's part with a short-term contract until January agreed so that both parties could assess how it went before committing to any long-term deal.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, Baxter’s stay at Home Park did not even last that long due to his persistent calf problem.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We wish Jose all the best in his recovery from his injury and in his future career following that.”</p>
      <p>The announcement that Baxter had left Argyle came on Thursday evening, and only hours after Lowe had spoken about the midfielder’s injury situation with the media.</p>

      <p>At the time he talked to reporters there was no indication from the Pilgrims’ boss that Baxter would be moving on.</p>
      <p>However, the pair had a discussion later in the day and they agreed to end his contract by mutual consent.</p>
      <p>Had Baxter been able to get fully fit, Argyle would have had one of the best players in League Two on their hands.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, despite glimpses of his talent, Baxter’s time at Argyle will be seen as a case of what might have been.</p>
