      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:05:43+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/hostess-now-sells-ding-dong-and-twinkie-coffee-flavors">Post Consumer Brands</a> has launched its latest Hostess-themed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/second-breakfast-americans-polled">cereal</a>, and it’s based on none other than the iconic Twinkies snack cake.</p>
      <p>The company announced Wednesday that Twinkies Cereal will hit <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-pennsylvania-mother-children-frantic-phone-call-walmart-parking-lot">Walmart</a> shelves nationwide in late December, giving fans “a delicious new way to enjoy the snack we all know and love in cereal form.”</p>

      <p>Twinkies Cereal is said to replicate the taste of the original golden sponge cake treats and their look -- only in miniature form.</p>

      <p>But reactions to the release of Twinkies Cereal were mixed, and naysayers offered some hilarious commentary.</p>
      <p>“They be high as he-- in the board meetings,” an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B40dWpXBym9/?igshid=muzvecpmyb8p">Instagram</a> user said, referring to the executive team behind the cereal idea.</p>
      <p>Another person had a similar reaction: “They should call em’ 'munchies' somebody high got this approved.”</p>
      <p>“Pack this up and send back to sender!” a commenter wrote.</p>

      <p>Some social media users also pointed out that such a sugary cereal isn’t the healthiest of choices.</p>
      <p>“Between Popeyes chicken sandwich and this crap we all gonna die before 55,” someone wrote.</p>
      <p>“Something else to add to obesity in America,” another Instagram commenter said.</p>
      <p>Yet another added, “Don’t nobody want that diabetes in a bowl."</p>

      <p>“Really? Kellogg just lost a lawsuit over the sugar in their cereals. Now Post wants our children to eat Twinkies cereal?” physician Robert Lustig tweeted. “How tone-deaf are they? They just hear the clanking of coins on the table I guess.”</p>
