      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 15 November 2019</p>
      <p>The Molasses Flood, the developer behind 2016's rogue-like river survival game The Flame in the Flood, has unveiled its latest adventure, Drake Hollow.</p>
      <p>There's not a huge amount of detail to share about Drake Hollow just yet, but The Molasses Flood's <a href="https://www.drakehollow.com/">newly launched website</a> refers to the game as a "action village building" experience.</p>
      <p>It all unfolds in a corrupted world where players can team up with friends to explore, gather supplies, battle monsters, and build villages to protect the local population - which just so happen to be tiny vegetable people known as, you guessed it, Drakes.</p>
