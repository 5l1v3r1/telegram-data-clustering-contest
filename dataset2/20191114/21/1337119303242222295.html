      <h1>PayPal abruptly cuts off Pornhub’s payroll, leaving performers with few payment options</h1>
      <h2>PayPal’s decision affects ‘over a hundred thousand performers’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>Pornhub said on Wednesday that PayPal would no longer support payments to Pornhub performers (<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3abgv/paypal-pulls-out-of-pornhub-payments">via <i>Vice</i></a>). In <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/9122">a blog post</a>, Pornhub said that it was “devastated” by the decision, which cuts off the primary way it pays “over a hundred thousand performers.”</p>
      <p>In a statement given to <i>Vice</i>, PayPal said that the company discovered that “Pornhub has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission. We have taken action to stop these transactions from occurring.” PayPal <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-hope-paypals-dick-falls-off-1839870796?rev=1573775291913&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&amp;utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">told <i>Gizmodo</i></a> that these “business payments” apply to payments to performers. And PayPal’s <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fus%2Fwebapps%2Fmpp%2Fua%2Facceptableuse-full&amp;referrer=theverge.com">acceptable use policy</a> also forbids “certain sexually oriented materials or services,” which, as <i>Vice</i> points out, is murky enough phrasing to give PayPal leeway to make decisions like this.</p>
      <aside>Performers can now be paid by check, direct deposit, the Paxum e-wallet, or the Verge cryptocurrency</aside>
      <p>Pornhub tells <i>The Verge</i> that the decision affects performers who are part of Pornhub’s <a href="https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/202715537-Model-Payment-Program">Model Program</a>, which lets individuals upload their own videos and earn advertising revenue from those videos. The company is pointing performers toward its <a href="https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/227726527-What-type-of-payment-method-is-offered-">other payment options</a> including check, direct deposit, the Paxum e-wallet, and the Verge cryptocurrency (no relation to <i>The Verge</i>). Pornhub tells us that it will “continue to add more sex worker-friendly” ways to get paid and that it’s exploring more crypto options as well.</p>
      <p>It seems like a reach to expect the hundred thousand performers to switch over to a single type of cryptocurrency for their paychecks, though, and direct deposit may also be dicey for some: a number of banks refuse to serve sex workers, according to <a href="https://survivorsagainstsesta.org/platforms-discriminate-against-sex-workers/">this list</a> compiled by Survivors Against SESTA. Pornhub explained last year that PayPal was a key alternative to banks: “PayPal specifically is a method of payment that many people, who may not have the luxury of a bank account, rely on to get paid,” <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/6921">the company wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s decision to drop Pornhub appears to have been sudden, as some have expressed dissatisfaction on having to scramble to find a way to receive payments (though Pornhub seems to be helping out):</p>

      <p>The notice also seems to have gone out to people whose videos were wrongly uploaded to Pornhub, insulting at least one person.</p>
