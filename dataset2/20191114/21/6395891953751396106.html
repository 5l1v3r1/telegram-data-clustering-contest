      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Harry Kane scored a first-half hat trick as England secured qualification for the 2020 European Championship with a 7-0 victory over Montenegro in the team's 1,000th game on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The landmark night was completed by Tammy Abraham's first England goal.</p>
      <p>England will be back at Wembley at the finals, with three group-stage games at the national stadium which is one of 12 venues being used by UEFA in 12 cities across Europe.</p>
      <p>The semifinals and final are also at Wembley in July 2020.</p>
      <p>The first task for Gareth Southgate's side was securing a place in the draw later this month after clinching top spot in qualifying from Group A.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sent England in front in the 11th minute after being set up by the first of Ben Chilwell's three assists. The left back's next two - a free kick and corner - were completed by Kane's headers.</p>
      <p>After Marcus Rashford netted on the half-hour, Kane completed his second consecutive Wembley hat trick with a close-range finish in the 37th minute to take his England haul to 31 goals.</p>
      <p>After a flood of goals in the first half, the Montenegro net was only breached after the break by Aleksandar Sofranac's own-goal and Abraham in the 84th.</p>
