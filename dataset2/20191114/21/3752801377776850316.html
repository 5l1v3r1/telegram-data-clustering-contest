      <p>Mounting the steps of the presidential palace as acting head of state, Jeanine Anez raised in both hands an old leather-bound volume of the holy Gospels.</p>
      <p>The gesture made it clear what side of the country's political and social divide she was on - and reflected the rise of Evangelical groups in the Latin American country.</p>
      <p>Gone was Socialist leader Evo Morales, an atheist who had done away with oaths on the Bible and had overseen a new constitution that made Bolivia a secular state.</p>
      <p>Now Morales's opponents - conservative and Christian - were back in charge.</p>
      <p>"God has allowed the Bible to come back into the palace. May he bless us," Anez said.</p>
      <p>"Glory to God!" yelled supporters gathered around her.</p>
      <p>Anez ascended to the balcony of the palace, where she was handed another volume, a Bible in a purple cover, and waved it triumphantly.</p>
      <p>Latin America is largely Catholic but over recent years other, Protestant-rooted churches have flourished.</p>
      <p>In neighboring Brazil, they played a prominent role in the election that brought far-right President Jair Bolsonaro to power last year.</p>
      <p>In Bolivia, a survey published in September by newspaper Pagina Siete indicated about 75% of Bolivians were Catholic and about 18% Evangelical.</p>
      <p>Before Morales became president in 2006, state officials would typically take the oath of office on the Bible, crossing themselves and swearing by "God and the fatherland."</p>
      <p>The country's first indigenous leader, from a poor coca-growing region, Morales expressed mistrust of Christianity, associating it with European colonists who massacred indigenous people.</p>
      <p>He ended the practice of religious oaths of office: under his leadership officials would raise their left fist and put their right hand on their chest.</p>
      <p><b>Armed with a Bible</b>Â </p>
      <p>The Bible made a come-back to public life and political discourse during the angry clashes that erupted after the election on October 20.</p>
      <p>Morales's opponents accused him of rigging the result, while he accused them in turn of plotting a "coup" against him.</p>
      <p>Amid deadly unrest, one of his most prominent opponents, Santa Cruz regional leader Luis Fernando Camacho, invoked Biblical powers in his bid to oust Morales.</p>
      <p>In a speech to supporters at the foot of the Christ the Redeemer statue in the central city, he vowed to bring a Bible to the presidential palace to force Morales out.</p>
      <p>"I am not coming with weapons, I am coming with my faith and my hope, with a Bible in my right hand and his resignation letter in my left," Camacho told supporters.</p>
      <p>His call was seen as harnessing support from both traditional Catholics and Evangelicals.</p>
      <p>On Sunday after Morales fled the country, Camacho finally entered the palace and kneeled inside, laying down a Bible over a Bolivian flag.</p>
      <p>Even before the contested decision to name Morales winner of the vote, the rise of Evangelicals had marked the electoral campaigns.</p>
      <p>One candidate who rose to prominence was Chi Hyun Chung of the Christian Democrat Party, a Presbyterian pastor who vocally opposes homosexuality and abortion.</p>
      <p>The contested count indicated that he had received 8.8 percent of the votes, behind Morales's lead conservative rival Carlos Mesa.</p>
      <p>Analyst Cesar Cabrera interpreted this as the result of protest votes, particularly among discontented young voters - and a sign of a "macho conservative" current in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>The Organisation of American States has audited the election results. It recommended canceling them and holding new polls.</p>
      <p>The secretary general of the OAS, Luis Almagro, called on the Catholic Church in Bolivia to calm the unrest by calling the two sides to negotiate.</p>
      <p>He said "institutions with legitimacy" were needed to mediate.</p>
