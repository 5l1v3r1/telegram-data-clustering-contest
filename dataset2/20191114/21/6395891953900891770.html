      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Senator Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax is putting her at odds with some of Wall Street's wealthiest, and the fight is increasingly spilling out into the open.</p>
      <p>In an interview on business new channel CNBC Thursday, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman said Warren's plan to impose a new tax on the nation's richest people would "penalize success" and that a Warren presidency would mean "big trouble" for Wall Street and the country.</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts senator has made an issue of income inequality in her campaign for the White House. One of her key proposals is a 2% tax on every dollar of an individual's wealth above $50 million.</p>
      <p>But as Warren has gained in the polls, the reaction from Wall Street and the financial industry has become louder and more antagonistic.</p>
