      <h1>Study to assess efficiency of T3 Malaria Policy launched</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:07:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:07</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Awadzi, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Three organisations have collaborated  and launched a research study to assess and review the efficiency of the Test, Treat the Track (T3) Malaria Policy in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The partners are the Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights, Kintampo Health Research Centre and the Anglican Diocesan Development Relief Organization.</p>
      <p>With support from Coffy International, the study seeks to encourage a better Malaria Control Programme, which allows people to get the right intervention, at the right time and in the right place.</p>
      <p>Mr Peter Meyers of Coffy International, at the launch of the Research study, in Accra on Thursday, said his organisation was hopeful to facilitate a partner-led learning.</p>
      <p>In 2012, the World Health Organization launched a new initiative called T3, Test, Treat and Track as a framework for Malaria Control and elimination.</p>
      <p>Ghana adopted the T3 initiative in 2013, and developed guidelines for implementing the policy.</p>
      <p>Mr Meyers said the policy sought to promote a shift from fever invariably equated with Malaria to the testing of every suspected case before treatment.</p>
      <p>“Seven years after the launch of the T3 policy, it is necessary to assess and review the efficiency of the policy in facilities".</p>
      <p>The study would help fill evidence gaps and implementation of the T3 policy, facilitate discussions about evidence and advocate for investment in Malaria Control and Management.</p>
      <p>The study will be conducted in the Nzema East Municipality and Mpohor District, Kintampo North Municipality and Kintampo South District in the and Mamprusi and Jirapa Municipalities.</p>
      <p>Nii Ankonu Annorbah-Sarpei of the Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights, in a presentation on the Introduction to the T3 study approach said, it would contribute to building the capacities of different key health Stakeholders to improve efficiency.</p>
      <p>He said they would work with a joint assessment team of health directorate personnel, local government at the District Assembly level and community members to collect data, using mobile phones or tablets.</p>
