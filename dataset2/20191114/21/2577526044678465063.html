      <p>The footage is the first we’ve seen from the game since a teaser trailer at Gamescom 2017, and was accompanied by a presentation from Shannon Loftis, head of the game’s newly named studio World’s Edge, in which she discussed the future of the Age of Empires franchise.</p>
      <p>As well as the new gameplay footage, Microsoft unveiled a launch trailer for <i>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</i>, which released earlier today.</p>
