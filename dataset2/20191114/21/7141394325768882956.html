      <p>From a unique take on Bitcoin’s potential to the smart-contract battle between EOS and Cardano, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bitcoin</b>
      </p>
      <p>The managing partner of crypto investment firm Morgan Creek Digital says he thinks Bitcoin and crypto will create the world’s first trillionaire.</p>
      <p>At the <a href="https://blockworksgroup.io/dasmarkets2019#m">DAS: Markets</a> conference in New York, Bitcoin bull Yusko equated the rise of blockchain and digital assets to the emergence of the internet, and said the technology will create a new class of wealth in the long run.</p>

        <i>“The great news about that is it’s going to create the greatest wealth in the history of mankind.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>[The] first 10 trillion-dollar company, [the] first trillionaire – it’s all going to come out of this space. Because what we’re doing is fundamentally changing the way we exchange value.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Yusko says his message to institutional investors is that Bitcoin is a digital form of gold, with more utility than the leading precious metal. He advises clients to allocate 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin and 3-5% into blockchain companies building on the technology.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Think about the wealth that was created, companies like Google and Amazon.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>They’re all going to be disrupted and they’re all going to be replaced with this new technological evolution. But it’s early.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ripple and XRP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kyoto University has just launched an XRP validator that will help the network verify and process transactions on the ledger.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ripple partnered with the university back in July through its University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI).</p>
      <p>UBRI is part of the company’s social impact program, Ripple for Good.</p>
      <p>The initiative has allocated $100 million toward supporting organizations that are accelerating and expanding global financial inclusion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cardano and EOS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Weiss Ratings is comparing the smart contract platforms Cardano and EOS.</p>
      <p>Although EOS launched its blockchain last year, the ratings agency <a href="https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1194663768803950592">says</a> Cardano now has the edge after launching its incentivized testnet.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Cardano is clearly superior to #EOS. EOS was first to market, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that of the two, Cardano is vastly superior… </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Cardano completed the 1st snapshot and balance check for its incentivized Shelley testnet. This latest step toward staking will allow investors to earn rewards on their $ADA for the 1st time. Don’t forget to move your #ADA to Daedalus wallet if you want to participate.”</i>
