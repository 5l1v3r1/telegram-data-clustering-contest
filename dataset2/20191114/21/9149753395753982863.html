      <p>At X019 in London today, Square Enix showed up to announce a whole boatload of Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox Game Pass, including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-game-list/">Game Pass for PC</a>. Here's the list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Final Fantasy 7</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 8</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 9</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 10</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 10-2</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 12</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 13</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 13-2</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 13: Lightning Returns</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 15</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phew. That's a lot of Final Fantasy—though all of the above games are available on Steam, they'll now also be playable for a hard-to-beat $5 per month on Game Pass. There are a ton more games coming to Game Pass this year and next—check out our continuously updated <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-game-list/">game list</a> where we're keeping track of them all.</p>
      <p>Sadly, though Square Enix <i>did</i> have some Kingdom Hearts news for console players, there's no sign of Kingdom Hearts 3 making its way to PC.</p>
