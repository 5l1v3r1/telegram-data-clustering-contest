      <p>A tsunami alert has been issued for Indonesia after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the northwest of the country’s Maluku Islands.</p>
      <p>The US Geological Survey reported that the magnitude 7.1 quake was centred in the sea about 140 kilometres northwest of Ternate in North Maluku province.</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climate and Geophysics Agency issued a tsunami warning, suggesting people to stay away from the coast line.</p>

      <p>The quake has awakened residents in some cities in North Sulawesi and North Maluku provinces, causing some to run out in panic to higher places, Kompas TV Reported.</p>
      <p>Rahmat Triyono, a senior official of the agency, which put the quake’s depth at 73 kilometres, said the warning was especially issued for the eastern part of North Sulawesi Province.</p>
      <p>“We issued the tsunami warning with an alert that any tsunami is estimated at only at a height of around 50-centimetres,” he told Kompas TV.</p>
      <p>Kompas TV also reported that government officials in North Maluku have prepared for possible evacuation of residents. Some patients at a hospital in North Sulawesi’s capital of Manado, were evacuated from their rooms. There were no immediate reports of injury or damage, but the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said that hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 300 kilometres of the epicentre.</p>
      <p>Indah Lengkong, who lives in the port city of Bitung, told <i>The Independent </i>people had initially panicked.</p>
      <p>“The house was visibly shaking,” she added. “The quake was very strong and lasted for a while. We can still feel tremors but weaker.”</p>
      <p>A woman in Tondano, North Sulawesi, tweeted: “The earth was literally shaking so hard.”</p>
      <p>Indonesia’s Metro TV said some people had fled to higher ground in North Maluku.</p>
      <p>Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at Imperial College London, told <i>The Independent:</i> “Fortunately, it has occurred offshore and at a reasonably deep depth so risk of damage from shaking and tsunami is low.”</p>
      <p>It reported no tsunami risk for more distant areas.</p>
