      <p><b>NEW YORK – </b>Netflix will produce a fourth sequel to “Beverly Hills Cop,” the 25-year-old franchise starring Eddie Murphy, who will return in the memorable lead role.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Paramount told AFP Thursday that the studio had sold the production rights to the online streaming giant, confirming a report by industry specialist The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
      <p>According to the Reporter, Murphy — who starred in the previous three chapters — will reprise his role as wisecracking detective Axel Foley.</p>
      <p>Paramount had previously planned to produce “Beverly Hills Cop 4” itself but dropped the idea in 2016.</p>
      <p>The first three installments of “Beverly Hills Cop” — released in 1984, 1987 and 1994 — earned $735 million at the global box office and propelled Eddie Murphy, already known for his roles in the comedies “Trading Places” (1983) and “48 Hours” (1982), to superstardom.</p>
      <p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first two films, will also helm the new project.</p>
      <p>The deal is a significant one for Netflix, which has maintained access to various Hollywood studios, while Disney — which has just launched an eponymous competitor streaming platform — exclusively produces content from its own studio and Fox, which Disney owns.</p>
