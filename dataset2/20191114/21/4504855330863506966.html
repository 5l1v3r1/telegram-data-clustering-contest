      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign raised more than $3 million on the day of the first public House impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale announced the haul on Twitter Thursday. He says the campaign raised $3,144,257 Wednesday and now hopes to raise $5 million within a 24-hour span.</p>
      <p>Democrats are investigating whether Trump abused his office when he pressed the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rivals.</p>
      <p>But Trump’s campaign has argued the probe is helping Trump, citing a spike in contributions and enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the national Republican Party and the campaign says that pushback efforts have generated nearly $10 million in free press in the states.</p>
      <p>He’s also reporting a surge in volunteers and says the response “we’re receiving from the field has been tremendous.”</p>
