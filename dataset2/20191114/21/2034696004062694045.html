      <p>The Danny Boyle directed film stars Himesh Patel as singer/songwriter Jack Malik, who lives in a world where nobody knows that the iconic Liverpool band ever existed.</p>
      <p>McCartney said he politely declined an offer to see the film at an official screening, but later asked his wife Nancy if she fancied watching it at a cinema in the Hamptons in the US.</p>
      <p>“That began when Richard Curtis, who [directed] <i>Love Actually</i>, wrote to me with the idea. And I thought, ‘This is a terrible idea’, but I couldn’t tell him, so I said, ‘Well, that sounds interesting – good luck,'” he told <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8543413/paul-mccartney-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019">Billboard</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think anything more of it. Then someone said Danny Boyle would direct it, and I thought, ‘They must think they can pull it off.’ And I thought nothing more of it until they asked if I wanted to see a screening. I asked Nancy, and we said, ‘Let’s go, you and me, on a date to the cinema’.”</p>

      <p>He continued: “We were in the Hamptons in the summer and there it was, so we got two tickets and walked in when the cinema went dark. Only a couple of people saw us. We were in the back row, giggling away, especially at all the mentions of Paul McCartney. A couple of people in front of us spotted us, but everyone else was watching the film. We loved it.”</p>
      <p>McCartney also gave an update on his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/paul-mccartney-has-been-working-on-a-its-a-wonderful-life-musical-2530344">forthcoming musical adaptation of</a> <i>It’s a Wonderful Life, </i>which is due out next year.</p>
      <p>He said: “The reason I never wanted to do a musical is I couldn’t think of a strong enough story. But a guy I’ve known since school in Liverpool became a theatrical impresario in London [Bill Kenwright], and he rang me up and said, ‘I’ve got the musical rights to <i>It’s a Wonderful Life’</i>. That’s a strong story.</p>
      <p>“So I met with the writer, Lee Hall, and I asked him to write the first 20 minutes of how he sees this as a play. So I was on holiday in the Hamptons, and I had lots of free time. So I read it and thought, ‘That’s a good opening, I like this’, and I sat at the piano and threw this melody at these dummy lyrics he had written. This was August. I sent it to them, and they said, ‘You’ve nailed it’. So it’s going well.”</p>
