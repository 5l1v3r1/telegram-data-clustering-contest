      <h1>Microsoft xCloud plans 2020 launch, preview adds 50 games to embarrass Stadia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:31:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia is set to launch next week, but <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/13/stadia-ama-assistant-chromecast-ultra-firmware/">missing features</a> and a <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/11/stadia-launch-games/">tiny launch list of games</a> is hurting the platform’s debut. Today, Microsoft announced that its xCloud streaming service would debut in full next year and, as a kick to Stadia’s pants, the service just added 50 more games too.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964434/microsoft-xcloud-preview-ps4-controller-windows-10-support-2020"><i>The Verge</i></a>, Microsoft’s Phil Spencer revealed that the company plans to launch its xCloud game streaming sometime in 2020. This isn’t a hard commitment, but the company is “planning” to integrate xCloud with Xbox Game Pass sometime next year.</p>
      <p>With the service’s official launch, it will also bring official support for PS4 controllers (which already <i>technically</i> works) as well as extending from Android phones over to Windows 10 PCs. There was even a hint that, instead of <i>only</i> Xbox games, the service could one day include PC titles too. As for iOS support, there’s a prototype working, but Microsoft is still “working with Apple” to bring it to the public.</p>
      <p>While Microsoft will be behind Stadia by the time xCloud launches, it won’t be behind when it comes to games. Alongside this announcement, Microsoft also delivered <i>50 new games</i> to its xCloud Preview which are already live. This includes huge titles such as Madden NFL 20, Just Cause 4, Forza Horizon 4, and many others. The full list is found below (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964411/microsoft-project-xcloud-new-games-list-50-games-support"><i>The Verge</i></a>) including the four titles that were already on the service.</p>
      <p>With xCloud only in <i>preview</i>, this huge list of games is pretty embarrassing for Google’s Stadia which will <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/11/stadia-launch-games/">launch with just 12 titles</a>. While more <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/13/new-google-stadia-features/">will be coming on a regular basis</a>, it’s still a tiny list at launch, especially considering that, for preview members, xCloud’s games are free for the time being.</p>
