      <h2>Residents told to keep doors and windows closed and buses diverted as 160ft exclusion zone was set up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:11:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">James Cartledge, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/james-cartledge/</a></address>
      <p>A 160ft exclusion zone was in place on a Birmingham street as 30 firefighters tackled a blaze in a garage containing chemicals.</p>
      <p>The scene, near the junction of Oxhill Road and Windermere Road in Handsworth, was sealed off when the blaze broke out early on Thursday evening, November 14.</p>
      <p>Six fire engines were sent to the scene after crews found the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/live-fire-oxhill-road-handsworth-17259656">unidentified chemicals in the garage</a> .</p>
      <p>Nearby residents were told to keep their doors and windows closed and a passing driver spoke on Twitter of "zero visibility down the back roads and explosions/bangs everywhere".</p>

      <p>The number of crews was later reduced to four after the fire was extinguished and West Midlands Fire Service was looking to hand control of the incident to West Midlands Police.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Incident commander Dave Boucher said: "We were mobilised to a garage fire. On arrival crews identified there was a fire in a garage with some unknown chemicals.</p>
      <p>"We put a 50-metre cordon around and the crews have now extinguished the fire.</p>
      <p>"At the height of the fire, we had six appliances here but we have scaled that down to four.</p>
      <p>"We are keeping a small cordon but hopefully we’ll be handing this incident over to the police shortly."</p>
      <p>Buses were diverted at the height of the fire. The exact location of the blaze, how it started and how much damage was caused were not known.</p>
