      <p>
        <b>Companies in the news:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cineplex Inc. (TSX:CGX). Up $1.22 or 5.3 per cent to $24.32. Cineplex Inc. shares rose after the company reported record high revenue for its third quarter and outperformed analyst expectations, helped by a strong film slate including "The Lion King" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home." Cineplex reported Thursday that its third-quarter profit rose to $13.4 million from $10.2 million a year earlier. Revenue grew 8.3 per cent to a record $418.4 million as theatre attendance increased 1.8 per cent due to what Cineplex called a stronger film slate compared with last year. In addition to The Lion King and Spider-Man, Cineplex attributed the strength to films such as "Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw," "It Chapter Two" and "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."</p>
      <p>Freshii Inc. (TSX:FRII). Down one cent to $2.70. Freshii Inc. continued to see traffic to its health-food eateries fall during its most recent quarter, but the company believes upcoming initiatives including a loyalty program can win over consumers. Same-store sales, a key retail metric, fell 3.7 per cent for the quarter ended Sept. 29. CEO Matthew Corrin said the company's current program, which focuses on offering limited-time menu items, isn't driving new traffic. Freshii's digital marketing campaigns and other initiatives expected to roll out next year will look to lure new customers into its stores, he said.</p>
      <p>Canopy Growth Corp. — Canopy Growth Corp.'s share price hit a 2019 low Thursday after the Canadian cannabis producer posted a $374.6-million quarterly loss, missed analyst revenue estimates and warned that a key revenue target may not be achieved. The company announced that second-quarter net revenue totalled $76.6 million, which was down 15 per cent from the prior quarter and below an average estimate of $107 million compiled by financial markets data firm Refinitiv. Interim chief executive Mark Zekulin also told analysts during a conference call that his previous projection of $250 million in revenue for the company's fourth quarter, ending in March, "is increasingly unlikely."</p>
      <p>Chorus Aviation Inc. (TSX:CHR). Up five cents to $8.20. Chorus Aviation Inc. reported a profit of $24.2 million in its latest quarter as revenue increased 2.8 per cent compared with a year ago. The regional aircraft company says the profit amounted to 15 cents per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, weighed down by a $7.1-million loss on foreign exchange. The result compared with a profit of $43.6 million or 31 cents per share a year ago when it benefited from an $11.3-million gain on foreign exchange. Operating revenue totalled nearly $351.5 million, up from $342 million.</p>
