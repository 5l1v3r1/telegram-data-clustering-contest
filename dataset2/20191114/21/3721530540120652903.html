      <p>For years now, Sega’s beat-em-up/virtual tourism series, Yakuza, has been known as a PlayStation-exclusive. Well, today, Microsoft and Sega announced that <i>Yakuza 0</i>, <i>Yakuza Kiwami</i>, and follow-up <i>Yakuza Kiwami 2</i> are all headed to Xbox One and Game Pass sometime in early 2020.</p>
      <p>The games, which were developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, follow the early days of Kazuma Kiryu as he makes his way through Tokyo. Famed for being eccentric and for having extensive side activities that imbue the world with flavor, the series has become somewhat of a cult classic among fans.</p>
      <p>In our original reviews of the games, Polygon gave props to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/19/14193836/yakuza-0-review-ps4-playstation-4-sega-atlus"><i>Yakuza 0</i> for having plenty of “heart,”</a> while <i>Yakuza Kiwami</i> is hailed as a “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/21/16177600/yakuza-kiwami-ps4-playstation-4-remake-review">great update to an old game.</a>” The sequel, <i>Yakuza Kiwami 2</i>, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/29/17786580/yakuza-kiwami-2-review">includes many of the series’ “greatest hits” </a>in terms of gameplay.</p>
      <p>If you thought this day would never come, you’re not alone. One of the top-voted replies to the YouTube trailer for this announcement exclaims, “Pinch me I must be dreaming!”</p>
