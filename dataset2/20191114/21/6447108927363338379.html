      <p>During E3 2019 Crossfire X was announced to be coming to Xbox One with the free to play shooter’s predecessor Crossfire amassing 650 million players on PC. Today at XO19 a new gameplay teaser was shown of the game in action. The trailer showcased the standard multiplayer first person shooter kind of approach but there was confirmation of bonus weapons like incoming mortars and a tank. In addition, there appear to be destructible environments.</p>

      <p>CrossfireX is set to launch in 2020 and interestingly the trailer ends with the message coming to Xbox consoles which has to mean the game will be launching on Xbox One and Project Scarlett further down the line. Maybe it will be a launch title for Microsoft’s next console.</p>
