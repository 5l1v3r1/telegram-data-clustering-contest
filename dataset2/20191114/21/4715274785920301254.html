      <h1>Martirez seeks to extend run in PPS Iloilo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:10:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author">Manila Standard Sports</a></address>
      <p>Local ace Althea Martirez hopes to ride the momentum of her two-title run in Roxas City as she goes for another “double” even as Drixcyn Guillano tries to rebound from a failed bid last week in the PPS-PEPP MCF Global national age-group tournament firing off today (Nov. 15) at LaPaz tennis courts in Iloilo City.</p>
      <p>Martirez, from Central Phl U, will be facing practically the same field she bested in the girls’ singles 16- and 18-and-under divisions in Roxas City plus a number of new faces aiming to steal the spotlight in the Group I tournament presented by Mayor Jerry Trenas in partnership with the MCF Global and Mac’s Crankit Foundation.</p>
      <p>They include Avril Suace, Rissa Cubos, Stephanie Crisosto, Petrina Aguirre and Crystal Ojaldon with Aguirre bannering the 14-U section that also drew Aleeva Suace, Jasmine Jaran and Dolores Hofilena with Queen Villa and Lourraine Jallorina joining Aleeva Suace and Hofilena in the 12-U category.</p>
      <p>Foiled by Kendrick Bona, a Mac’s Crankit-MCF Global protégé, in Roxas City, Guillano is going all-out for a big comeback, eyeing to sweep the boys’ 16- and 18-U titles in the five-day event presented by Dunlop, which also serves as part of the countrywide talent search put up by Palawan Pawnshop headed by president/CEO Bobby Castro.</p>
      <p>But out to stop Guillano are Rewel Justiniani, Joshua Raymundo, Roger Lamparero and Roxas City leg winner Nikhel Nowlakha with Bona also setting out to score a repeat in 16-U play that also features Gerald Gemida, Elemar Sealza, Angelo Mejia, Raymundo and Lamparero.</p>
      <p>Gemida, meanwhile, gains the top seeding in the boys’ 14-U side that includes Bona, Sealza, Derrick Guillano, Marben Alimarin, Jann Ituriaga, Lester Astromenada and Benedict Santiago, who repulsed Bona to snare the crown last week.</p>
      <p>Other titles to be disputed are in the 12-U category and 10-unisex along with 10-U, 14-U and 18-U doubles and the Legends 40s, 50s and 60s categories. For details, contact PPS-PEPP Sports Program Development director Bobby Mangunay at 0915-4046464.</p>
