They've lost their homes. They've lost their possessions," said Warden.<br/>Their mission?<br/>Hurricane Dorian relief.<br/>"People need food and water and shelter right now," said Warden.<br/>The most recent trip is one of dozens that their Fort Myers based flight group, <a href="https://sundownersflyingclub.com/">the Sundowners Flying Club,</a> has organized.<br/>The food, clothes and supplies they donated went to dozens of kids, who are finally getting back to school after the storm.<br/>"It was amazing because I am former educator and teacher," said Warden.<br/>"They're just wonderful kids raised by wonderful families," said Ehrlich.<br/>Some schools may be back in session, but a quick tour of Treasure Cay shows you that there is still much more to be done.<br/>"It's emotionally heartbreaking, it really is," said Ehrlich.<br/>But the pair says their flying club won't stop visiting, until that need is met.<br/>"It was very meaningful," said Warden.<br/>To date, the club has made 31 trips to the Bahamas.<br/>To learn more about how you can donate any money or items for future Bahamas flights, click <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/1s07imps2o?utm_medium=sms&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_na%20share-sheet&amp;rcid=e920028d50574f3caf2def4447580a15&amp;fbclid=IwAR0w4j5w54rZFLfjv9Ls5uAoyXop-HkCF8twE-Zk3zg2lNa6wE6QANSzRy4">here.</a></p>
