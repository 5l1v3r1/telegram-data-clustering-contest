      <p><i>Wasteland 3</i> has a release date: May 19, 2020. inXile Entertainment head Brian Fargo announced the date on Thursday at Microsoft’s X019 presentation in London.</p>
      <p>Fargo debuted a new <i>Wasteland </i>3<i> </i>trailer, showcasing new gameplay in the “‘80s-inspired post-apocalyptic world.” We got a peek at the role-playing game’s new story, which takes the game to “the frozen wastes of Colorado,” moving on from Arizona and Los Angeles. It’s the biggest Wasteland game in the franchise, with a budget three times larger than <i>Wasteland 2</i>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2014/5/2/5613114/wasteland-2-fallout-brian-fargo">according to inXile</a>.</p>
      <p>The new trailer detailed the snowy Colorado world — “a society built on violence.” inXile showed off what appeared to be a huge scorpion mech, as well as some of <i>Wasteland 3</i>’s “strategic combat.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/21/20825708/wasteland-3-pc-ps4-xbox-one-preview-gameplay-combat">Polygon played a <i>Wasteland 3</i> demo</a> in August and called it a “snowier, sleeker, and more substantial version of its five-year-old predecessor, <i>Wasteland 2</i>.” <i>Wasteland 3</i> is expected to have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/28/13081728/wasteland-3-announcement-fig-kickstarter-crowdfunding-release-date">multiplayer and an XCOM-style cinematic camera</a>.</p>
      <p>At X018 last year in Mexico City, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-one/2018/11/10/18080726/inxile-entertainment-microsoft-buyout-acquisition-xbox-x018">Microsoft announced it acquired inXile</a>, but noted the team would continue to work “autonomously.” In 2016, <i>Wasteland 3</i> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/9/13219116/wasteland-3-meets-fig-crowdfunding-goal">met its $2.75 million Fig crowdfunding goal</a>, reaching an end total of $3.1 million before it was acquired years later by Microsoft.</p>
      <p>More information about <i>Wasteland 3</i> will be announced during X019 on Nov. 15 at 12:30 p.m. EDT.</p>
