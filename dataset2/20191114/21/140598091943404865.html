      <h1>Frozen 2:  Disney sequel's environmental message for the Greta Thunberg generation </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/anita-singh/" target="_blank">Anita Singh</a></address>
      <p>Adults taking their children to the Frozen sequel will be braced for the cute characters and the infuriatingly catchy songs.</p>
      <p>But they should also prepare themselves for something else: being blamed for the destruction of the planet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/frozen-2-review-elsa-anna-tackle-colonialism-disneys-resonant/">Disney’s Frozen 2</a> carries an environmental message, according to early reviews, one that will chime with children’s concerns about climate change.</p>
      <p>The film’s heroines, Elsa and Anna, discover that earlier generations put urban planning before nature, disregarding the beliefs of a native tribe and bringing a curse down on the kingdom of Arendelle.</p>
      <p>They set out to right the adults’ wrongs. Young audiences may draw parallels between Elsa and Greta Thunberg, the climate change activist who has said: “Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago.”</p>

      <p>The film is released in the UK on November 22 and will have some way to go to match the box office success of the first Frozen film, which grossed over £1 billion.</p>
      <p>It features a song, Into The Unknown, which could become a hit to rival Let It Go, the tune from the first film.</p>
      <p>Disney is launching a major merchandising push in time for Christmas. Toys expected to fly off the shelves including a £20 singing Elsa doll and, for those with deep pockets, a three-foot tall Sven the reindeer for £120.</p>
      <p>The film-makers went to great lengths to make the relationship between the Elsa and Anna characters feel realistic.</p>
      <p>One of the writers spent months writing diary entries for them, and even went to see a psychologist to discuss the sisterly dynamic.</p>
      <p>“They really tried to make a very authentic human element to these cartoons,” said Kristen Bell, who voices Anna.</p>
      <p>“I want Anna to deal with her codependency, because she lives for everyone else and I often do that.”</p>
      <p>One of the new songs Bell performs in the film is called The Next Right Thing. She said: “I take a lot of inspiration from my husband and his AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] exposure and his sobriety. One foot in front of the other… you just do the next right thing.”</p>
