      <p>While it's always great to see the Final Fantasy series being a part of Xbox Game Pass, the real stars of the show are the Yakuza additions. This has always been regarded as a staple PlayStation 4 franchise, so when news broke that some of the games were coming to PC, Xbox One owners were hopeful that the titles would make the jump to their platform of choice. Luckily, that day is almost upon us.</p>
      <p>What games are you looking forward to the most? Let us know. This list is utterly spectacular to say the least and if you haven't subscribed to Xbox Game Pass yet, now it's a must-have for any gamer. However, it's not all good news. On November 30, a couple of games are leaving Xbox Game Pass like Abzu, Below, Football Manager 2019, Grid 2, Strange Brigade, and more. If you haven't played these titles yet, be sure to check them out.</p>
