      <p>Bacolod City will host the 73rd Philippine Airlines Interclub and the 34th PAL Seniors golf team championships in February and March next year, according to tournament director Henry Arabelo.</p>
      <p>The Men’s Regular team event is set March 4-7, 2020 with Cebu Country Club defending the overall title it won in historic fashion at its home ground last March.</p>
      <p>Competing in the second-tier Founders division, Cebu CC amassed 516 points to beat Manila Southwoods by nine points.</p>
      <p>It marked only the second time that a team outside the championship division won the Interclub. Veterans Golf Club first did the trick in 1988.</p>
      <p>Luisita settled for third, 26 points off the pace.</p>
      <p>The Seniors event, on the other hand, will be held February 26-29, 2020 with defending champion Luisita and Canlubang renewing their rivalry.</p>
      <p>Last March, Luisita staved off Canlubang’s final round rally to win by three points, collecting 569 points.</p>
      <p>It was Luisita’s 17th crown, solidifying its status as the most successful club in the Seniors division.</p>
      <p>Arabelo said invitations have been sent to local and foreign clubs.</p>
      <p>Venues for both tournaments are the Negros Occidental Golf Country Club, more popularly known as Marapara, and the Bacolod City Golf and Country Club (Binitin).</p>
      <p>The PAL Interclub is considered as the country’s premier team tournament that has produced the likes of Ben Arda, Golem Silverio, and Frankie Miñoza, among others.</p>
      <p>Through the years, the event has grown in size and stature with the influx of international teams from the United States, the Middle East, Asia and Europe.</p>
      <p>Organizers have set aside three days for practice rounds for both the Regular and Seniors tournaments.</p>
