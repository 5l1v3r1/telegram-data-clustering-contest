      <p><b>SEOUL — </b>Japan maintained its perfect record in Asia World Cup qualifying by beating Kyrgyzstan 2-0 while Iran lost a second straight match on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Takumi Minamino gave Japan the lead in Bishkek from the penalty spot four minutes before halftime and Genki Haraguchi added a second after 54 minutes.</p>
      <p>Japan, with four wins out of four, moved six points clear of second-placed Kyrgyzstan at the top of Group F.</p>
      <p>Iran slipped four points behind Iraq halfway through the group stage after substitute Alaa Abbas scored the winner in the second minute of injury time.</p>
      <p>Iraq moved to the top of Group C, two points of clear of Bahrain, which drew against Hong Kong 0-0.</p>
      <p>South Korea stayed first in Group H though it dropped points after drawing with Lebanon 0-0 in Beirut.</p>
      <p>Due to anti-government protests in the city, Lebanese authorities played the qualifier behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Vietnam took sole lead of Group G by three points after beating the United Arab Emirates 1-0 in Hanoi, while previous co-leader Thailand lost to Malaysia 2-1 in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia came from behind to defeat Uzbekistan 3-2 to go top of Group D.</p>
      <p>China, coached by 2006 World Cup winner Marcello Lippi, slipped five points behind Syria in Group A after losing to the Syrians 2-1 in Dubai.</p>
      <p>Osama Omari opened the scoring for Syria after 19 minutes, and Wu Lei equalized on the half hour. A Zhang Linpeng own goal with 14 minutes remaining condemned China to its first defeat.</p>
      <p>Only the winner of each of the eight groups and the four best second-placed teams progress to the next stage of qualification.</p>
