      <h1>Tesla registers Cybertruck trademark ahead of November 21 unveiling</h1>

      <p>Tesla has filed to register the name and logo for its yet-to-be-released “Cybertruck,” the name of its first all-electric pickup truck ahead of the vehicle’s unveiling event on November 21.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-cybrtrk.173658/">GenSao of the TeslaMotorClub</a>, The United States Patent and Trademark Office website shows Tesla, Inc. submitted two trademark applications for the phrases “CYBERTRUCK” and “CYBRTRK”. Tesla also has turned in an application for the truck’s official logo according to the Patent and Trademark Office’s website, all submitted on November 6, 2019, the same day CEO Elon Musk tweeted the date of the truck’s unveiling. The unveiling event will take place in Los Angeles near the SpaceX rocket factory.</p>

      <p>Speculation regarding the truck has been heavy, as nobody outside of Tesla’s inner-most circle has any sort of information other than some specifications Musk has released to the public, like its massive 300,000-lb towing capacity and seats that are <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-pickup-truck-6-seats-300k-towing-capacity/">reportedly big enough to fit Andre the Giant</a>. Even celebrity Joe Rogan, who hosted Musk as a guest on his podcast in September 2018, texted Musk a picture he found on the internet <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cyberpunk-pickup-truck-3d-renders/">of what the truck is rumored to look like</a>. However, Rogan was surprised when Musk responded by saying something along the lines of, “That’s not really our truck. It’s more Blade Runner-esque.” After all, he has described the truck publically as “cyberpunk” and states it will be “pretty sci-fi”.</p>

      <p>The truck is expected to have a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-pickup-truck-price-elon-musk/">base starting price of $49,000</a> and will pack somewhere between 400 and 500 miles of range.</p>
      <p>The all-electric car manufacturer will be competing with some of the most popular automakers in the world, including Ford, who sold the United States most popular line of trucks in 2018, the F-Series. With Rivian’s R1T truck also beginning production <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/rivian-rj-scaringe-nyt-r1t-r1s-production-volume/">in late-2020 or early-2021</a>, Tesla will not be selling the only electric pickup truck on the market and will have stiff competition from <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/rivian-amazon-700m-investment-round/">the Jeff Bezos backed company.</a></p>
