      <p>DUBAI: HSBC Holdings has laid off about 40 bankers in the UAE and Emirates NBD is cutting around 100 jobs, as banks in the Arab world’s second-biggest economy reduce costs.</p>
      <p>The cuts come amid weak economic growth, especially in Dubai, which is suffering from a property downturn.</p>
      <p>HSBC’s redundancies came after the London-based bank reported a sharp fall in earnings and warned of a costly restructuring, as interim CEO Noel Quinn seeks to tackle its problems head-on.</p>
      <p>HSBC has about 3,000 staff in the UAE, part of a nearly 10,000-strong workforce in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.</p>
      <p>The cuts at Dubai’s largest lender Emirates NBD came in consumer sales and liabilities, one source said, while a second played down the significance of the move.</p>
      <p>HSBC and Emirates NBD declined to comment.</p>
      <p>“The cuts are part of cost cutting and rationalizing to drive efficiencies in a challenging market,” the second source said.</p>
      <p>Other banks have also reduced staff this year. UAE central bank data shows local banks laid off 446 people in the 12 months until the end of September. Foreign banks added staff in the same period.</p>
      <p>Staff at local banks account for over 80 percent of the 35,518 banking employees in the country.</p>
      <p>The merger between Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Union Commercial Bank and Al Hilal Bank saw hundreds of redundancies.</p>
      <p>Commercial Bank International (CBI) said it would offer voluntary retirement to employees in September, which sources said saw over 100 departures. Standard Chartered, too, cut over 100 jobs in the UAE in September.</p>
      <p>Rating agency Fitch warned in September a weakening property market would put more pressure on the UAE’s banking sector. </p>
