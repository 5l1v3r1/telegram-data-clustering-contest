      <h2>ENGLAND 7-0 MONTENEGRO: Harry Kane scored three, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Marcus Rashford and Tammy Abraham all on the scoresheet also</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:37:29+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:37</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England's</a> Three Lions ripped Montenegro apart in their 1000th game to book their tickets for next summer’s European Championships.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate’s stars - the youngest side in 60 years - shrugged off the controversy surrounding Raheem Sterling’s bust up with Joe Gomez on Monday to demolish Montenegro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Gomez, however, was booed by sections of the Wembley crowd when he made his belated appearance as a 70th-minute substitute. The disappointing reception came in stark contrast to Sterling’s applause for him from the stands.</p>
      <p>Skipper Harry Kane had earlier grabbed a hat-trick while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> left-back Ben Chilwell provided a hat-trick of assists with Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain and Marcus Rashford joining in the fun.</p>
      <p>Montenegro defender Aleksander Sofranac put the ball through his own net with 24 minutes left for 6-0.</p>

      <p>Kane’s treble left England top of Group A and means he has now scored 31 times for his country. The Spurs hitman now needs just nine more to go level with Michael Owen on 40 international goals.</p>
      <p>Kane is the first player to score a hat-trick in consecutive appearances for England at Wembley, having netted three against Bulgaria last time out.</p>
      <p>He is also now England's all-time highest scoring starting captain with 24 goals.</p>
      <p>England had raced into a 4-0 lead after just half an hour - the earliest they had done so for 73 years - before Kane added their fifth shortly before half time.</p>
      <p>A host of Three Lions legends, including Paul Gascoigne, Trevor Francis, David Seaman and Wayne Rooney were then presented to the Wembley crowd at half time.</p>
      <p>Here are player ratings from a comfortable victory at Wembley...</p>
      <h3>Jordan Pickford 8</h3>
      <p>Amid the goal rush kept his wits about him to save superbly from Simic.</p>
      <h3>Trent Alexander-Arnold 8</h3>
      <p>His deliveries into the box should come wrapped in a red ribbon. A gift for Kane’s hat-trick.</p>

      <h3>Harry Maguire 7</h3>
      <p>A couple of anxious moments but overall a decent night for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> man to stretch his legs.</p>
      <h3>John Stones 7</h3>
      <p>The perfect opponents for him to step out from the back and build from the back.</p>
      <h3>Ben Chilwell 8</h3>
      <p>An assist hat-trick in 25 minutes! Three excellent deliveries, regardless of the Montenegro defending.</p>

      <h3>Harry Winks 8</h3>
      <p>Given the freedom of the park to spray the ball around - and took it.</p>
      <h3>Mason Mount 8</h3>
      <p>Unlucky to have what would have been his first England goal ruled out for offside. Then forced a second half own goal.</p>
      <h3>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 8</h3>
      <p>Just can’t stop scoring can he? Terrific composure in the box to dispatch his diagonal finish.</p>

      <h3>Marcus Rashford 7</h3>
      <p>Nice, clinical finish to score but should have had a hat-trick, missing two gilt-edged opportunities.</p>
      <h3>Jadon Sancho 7</h3>
      <p>Gave his full-back nightmares with his pace and his trickery.</p>
      <h3>Harry Kane 9</h3>
      <p>Another game, another hat-trick after Bulgaria. But would have had a couple more had he not missed two early sitters.</p>
