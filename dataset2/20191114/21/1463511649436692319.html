      <h1>Why we decided to work in harmony with Executive – Lawan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:20:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has said that the 9th National Assembly decided to work in harmony with the Executive to enhance productivity in governance.</p>
      <p>Lawan stated this in Abuja at his investiture as a fellow of Geoinformation Society of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>His Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi, made this known in a statement in Abuja on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to Lawan, a good working relationship between the two arms of government would also forestall the anxiety and instability that a rancorous relationship could bring about.</p>
      <p>“The past uneasy relationship between the Legislature and the Executive was not helpful to anyone.</p>
      <p>“We made a conscious decision this year, 2019 when we ran for the office of President of the Senate.</p>
      <p>“We told ourselves that we are first and foremost representatives of Nigerians. We came on different platforms, vehicles that took us to the construction site.</p>
      <p>“And of course, at the construction site, all of us are supposed to work together to construct that structure,”Lawan said.</p>
      <p>He said that to avoid the pitfall of the past, there was a conscious decision to have a National Assembly, particularly the Senate that was bi-partisan and work for the collective interest of the people.</p>
      <p>Lawan said that the 9th National Assembly would support President Muhammadu Buhari because “we believe that fight between the legislature and the executive does not help anyone”.</p>
