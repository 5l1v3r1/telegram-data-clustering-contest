      <p><b>TAIPEI — </b>Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said Thursday that the timing is right for Taiwan and Japan to talk about the self-ruled island's bid to join a multinational trade agreement in which Japan plays a leading role.</p>
      <p>Noting that Japan is Taiwan's third-largest trading partner and Taiwan is Japan's fourth-largest trading partner, Tsai said, "At a time of global economic recession, now is a good time for Taiwan and Japan to discuss Taiwan's admission to the CPTPP."</p>
      <p>She was referring to the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which came into force late last year and started the second round of accession talks with potential new members this year.</p>
      <p>"We hope to see bilateral cooperation between our two countries move in this direction," she said.</p>
      <p>Tsai made the remarks while meeting Japan's new de facto ambassador Hiroyasu Izumi at the Presidential Office.</p>
      <p>Hailing Izumi as an experienced diplomat, Tsai said she looks forward to working with him and reaching new milestones on the path toward stronger bilateral ties.</p>
      <p>Despite the lack of diplomatic ties, Tsai said bilateral cooperation and exchanges have become closer than ever before.</p>
      <p>She gave an example of Japan's joint hosting with Taiwan in March of an international workshop on fighting corruption, held under the Global Cooperation and Training Framework.</p>
      <p>The Taiwan-U.S. platform was launched in 2015 for addressing global and regional challenges. The March conference marks the first time for Japan to be involved.</p>
      <p>Economic ties between Taiwan and Japan also remain robust.</p>
      <p>Bilateral trade totaled U.S.$67.2 billion last year, up about 7 percent from the previous year. Japanese investment in Taiwan last year increased more than 138 percent from the previous year to U.S.$1.5 billion, while Taiwanese investment in Japan grew over 206 percent to U.S.$620 million.</p>
      <p>In addition to close economic ties, a majority of Taiwanese feel strong affinity for Japan.</p>
      <p>According to a survey released by the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association on Thursday, 59 percent of Taiwanese say they feel the most affinity toward Japan among all countries and regions, the highest since 2008.</p>
      <p>China is in distant second place at 8 percent and the United States in third place at 4 percent.</p>
      <p>The survey also found that 50 percent of the respondents said Japan is trustworthy, while 40 percent are ambivalent and only 9 percent said it is not trustworthy.</p>
      <p>The poll, conducted from Feb. 14 and Feb. 27, interviewed a random national sample of 1,003 adults around the island, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</p>
