      <p>Cape Town - <b>PSV Eindhoven </b>forward <b>Steven Bergwijn</b> is interested in joining <b>Manchester United </b>at the end of the season, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Bergwijn, who was courted by English clubs over the summer, is one of the brightest talents currently playing in the Eredivisie but it appears his time in Holland could be coming to an end.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old graduated from PSV's academy to make his senior debut from the bench in a 2-0 win over Heracles in May 2015.</p>
      <p>He has gone on to establish himself as a key figure at the Philips Stadion and so far, this season has chipped in with three goals and nine assists in 19 appearances across all competitions.</p>
      <p>A number of clubs across Europe have been keeping very close tabs on the winger over the past couple of years but his preferred destination is Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Reports claim Bergwijn's representatives have spoken about his desire to head to the Red Devils, however, that is dependent on them being in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Contrary to the player's hopes, it currently looks unlikely that United will qualify for the elite European competition next season.</p>
      <p>They have only finished in the top-four once in the past four seasons and, presently, they are nine points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Understandably the Netherlands international wants to be playing at the highest level and United currently can't offer that.</p>
      <p>The report states that PSV would demand a fee in the region of Â£40 million for Bergwijn who is under contract until the summer of 2023.</p>
