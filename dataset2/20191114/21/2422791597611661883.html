      <p>IQALUIT, Nunavut - The Nunavut government is slowly returning to normal nearly two weeks after its computer systems were paralyzed by a cyber attack.</p>
      <p>Dean Wells, the territory's chief information officer, says departments are beginning to come back online.</p>
      <p>Government employee paycheques are expected to be delivered Friday as normal.</p>
      <p>All Nunavut government computers were paralyzed on Nov. 2 when a ransomware virus entered the system.</p>
      <p>It encrypted individual files on various servers and workstations and locked out regular users.</p>
      <p>The government says it refused to pay the ransom and offices were forced to rely on fax machines, paper forms and telephone calls while the system was repaired.</p>
