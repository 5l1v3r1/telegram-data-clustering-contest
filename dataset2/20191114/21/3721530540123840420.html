      <p>Toady at its annual X019 presentation, Microsoft previewed a handful of additional aircraft coming to <i>Microsoft </i><i>Flight Simulator</i>. They include Boeing’s massive 747 commercial jetliner, the fan-favorite Citation twin-engine jet, and a tiny aerobatics airplane. You can see them all in action in the new trailer above.</p>
      <p><i>Flight Simulator</i> is the oldest franchise in the Microsoft catalog, older than Office and older than Windows itself. The last version of the game was released in 2006. This new version, in development by a French team at Asobo Studio, relies on Bing satellite imagery. It draws on more than two petabytes of information, including high-resolution scans of landmarks like the pyramids at Giza and the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, to create lifelike images for virtual pilots.</p>

      <p><i>Flight Simulator</i> is expected to enter a closed alpha soon. The game is coming to Xbox One and Windows PC in 2020, and will be included in the Xbox Game Pass program.</p>
