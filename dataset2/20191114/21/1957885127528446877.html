      <p><b>Deals</b> by James Pickard, Commerce Editor Updated on 15 November 2019</p>
      <p>As part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-watch-microsofts-big-x019-livestream-here">X019</a> event in London today, Microsoft has revealed its full lineup of Xbox Black Friday deals coming in 2019.</p>
      <p>We already had a small idea of what was coming after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-06-heres-a-sneak-peek-of-this-years-xbox-black-friday-deals">first wave of Xbox deals</a> was announced last week, but today's offering is way more substantial.</p>
      <p>Leading the way is a huge $150 discount on the full range of Xbox One X consoles. Microsoft has clarified that this includes all of the newest bundles, too, so you can expect to see an Xbox One X with Gears 5 down to $349.99. It's unclear how this offer is going to be replicated in the UK, but a £100 price cut to £349.99 for an Xbox One X bundle seems most likely.</p>

      <p>Xbox One S consoles aren't being forgotten, either. The already-cheaper Xbox One S All-Digital Edition will plummet even further to just $149.99 with copies of Minecraft, Sea of Thieves and the Legendary Rogue Spider Knight Skin for Fortnite Battle Royale all included. There's also going to be $100 off all other Xbox One S consoles and bundles. Expect the All-Digital Edition to be £149.99 and standard Xbox One S consoles to be £199.99 in the UK.</p>
      <p>Microsoft also reconfirmed that there would be £10/$20 off select Xbox Wireless Controllers for the Black Friday period.</p>
      <p>With its growing popularity, it was inevitable that there would also be an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate deal for Black Friday. So, starting from today, you can get your first three months for just £1/$1.</p>

      <p>Given the vast library of games currently available, plus all the new titles coming later this year and into 2020, it's still looking like one of the best value deals in gaming right now. I mean, who doesn't want The Witcher 3, a trio of Yakuza games and most of the Final Fantasy back catalogue at their fingertips for this cheap?</p>
      <p>Lastly, if you want to purchase them separately, a number of Xbox One games will be discounted for Black Friday too. There's a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games">Flash Sale currently live on the Xbox Store</a> while the following deals have also been announced for the Black Friday period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gears 5 for 33% off</li>
        <li>Forza Horizon 4 for 50% off</li>
        <li>Sea of Thieves: Anniversary Edition for 50% off</li>
        <li>State of Decay 2 for 50% off</li>
        <li>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice for 50% off</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The full list of game offers will be available to browse on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/home">Microsoft Store</a> from 24th November.</p>
      <p>In fact, that's the date when all of these Xbox Black Friday deals will be going live on the Microsoft Store and various other retail partners. If you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Xbox Live Gold member, though, you'll get early access from 21st November.</p>
      <p>When the time comes, you'll be able to find these offers and many more on our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-06-xbox-black-friday-deals-2019">Xbox Black Friday deals hub</a>.
