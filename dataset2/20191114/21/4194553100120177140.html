      <h1>(Video) “Our Sadio” – LFC fans love Mane helping unload Senegal’s team coach</h1>

      <p>Sadio Mane is a very nice man. Remember that video going around of him helping some men clean out a mosque in Liverpool? And when he realised he was being filmed, he went all shy? He’s a proper top bloke.</p>
      <p>Well now another video of the star winger doing something which shows he has a caring side has emerged online, as he’s on international duty with Senegal.</p>
      <p>As he exited the team coach, he noticed that there was a load of stuff that needed taking inside, so he picked up a couple handfuls of items and made his way on.</p>
      <p>It’s only something simple, but sadly not every world class footballer would do this.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Take a watch of the video below:</b>

      <blockquote>Senegal no 18 just walks out the bus and keeps walking. Our Sadio walks out and helps unload.
