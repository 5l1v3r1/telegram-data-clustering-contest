      <p>COLOMBO: More than 250 Sri Lankan convicts aged over 65 have been given amnesty just days after the president sparked outrage by pardoning the well-connected killer of a Swedish teen, officials said on Thursday (Nov 14).</p>
      <p>Jude Jayamaha, the scion of a wealthy Sri Lankan family and convicted in 2005 of murdering Yvonne Jonsson, walked free from death row on Saturday after Maithripala Sirisena's pardon.</p>

      <p>His release prompted outrage from the victim's family, rights groups, and people on social media - and also initiated a mini-rebellion from inmates at the country's main high-security prison, who demanded similar treatment.</p>
      <p>In an apparent bid to calm the situation, Sirisena - due to step down after elections on Saturday - issued a pardon for some 267 prisoners aged over 65.</p>
      <p>"We have now got orders from the president and the prisoners will walk free today and tomorrow," a justice ministry official told AFP.</p>
      <p>Officials said all those granted pardons were serving time for offences other than rape or murder.</p>
      <p>Jayamaha was initially sentenced to 12 years in jail for the brutal murder of Jonsson, who was 19. His trial heard her skull had been fractured into 64 pieces.</p>
      <p>An appeal court upgraded the sentence to the death penalty, a decision reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 2014.</p>
      <p>Ruling party presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa said earlier this week he would consider every legal option to overturn the pardon if elected.</p>
      <p>There are around 375 people on death row in Sri Lanka, but the country has had a moratorium on executions since 1976.</p>
