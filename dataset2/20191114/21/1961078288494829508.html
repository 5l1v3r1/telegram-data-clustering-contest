      <h1>Stephanie Parze’s Car Is at Home. So Is Her Phone. But She’s Missing.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:41:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author">Azi Paybarah</a></address>
      <p>Her car was in the driveway. Her phone was on the couch. Her dog was running around. Everything about Stephanie Parze’s home in New Jersey, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/11/05/stephanie-parze-new-jersey-missing-woman-vpx.hln">her father says</a>, seemed undisturbed — except that she was not there.</p>
      <p>The last time her mother saw Ms. Parze, they had kissed goodbye after a night out with friends and family, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/new-jersey-woman-stephanie-parze-goes-missing-after-visit-to-psychic/">according to a report.</a> She asked her daughter to call or text when she got home. On the way, Ms. Parze sent her mother, Sharlene, a picture through Snapchat.</p>
      <p>That was about two weeks ago, the night before Halloween. The family says they haven’t heard from her since. Ms. Parze, 25, had suddenly vanished.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, more than 170 law enforcement officials from New York and New Jersey descended onto <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/long-pond-park">Long Pond Park</a>, a 115-acre preserve on the southern end of Staten Island, as part of the search, Chris Swendeman, a spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office, said.</p>
      <p>In the bitter cold, the searchers scoured the park for hours, hoping to find clues about the woman’s disappearance. To help in that effort, they were joined by <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2019/11/man-who-dated-missing-nj-woman-appears-in-court-remains-jailed-on-child-porn-charge.html">members of the New York Police Department’s canine unit</a>.</p>
      <p>The search at the park did not continue on Thursday. Mr. Swendeman declined to say what the result of the search was, or what specifically had led them to the park.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going to talk about an open investigation,” he said.</p>
      <p>How exactly Ms. Parze, a makeup artist and nanny, went missing is unclear.</p>

      <p>“We don’t have any indication of any forced entry,” her father, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/11/05/stephanie-parze-new-jersey-missing-woman-vpx.hln">Ed, told CNN</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pix11.com/2019/11/13/investigators-search-wooded-section-of-staten-island-in-connection-to-missing-nj-woman/">Her mother told WPIX</a>, “The unknown kills you — not knowing where she is, what’s happening to her.”</p>
      <p>The search on Wednesday was the second time recently that officials combed the Staten Island park, a wetland and woodland area, about 30 miles north of Ms. Parze’s home in Freehold Township, an affluent New Jersey suburb of 35,000 people.</p>
      <p>Days after Ms. Parze’s disappearance, the police searched the phone of Ms. Parze’s ex-boyfriend, John Ozbilgen, 29. That search led to the arrest of Mr. Ozbilgen on unrelated child pornography charges, according to a spokesman for the county prosecutor. Mr. Ozbilgen, who is still in custody, has not been charged in connection with Ms. Parze’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for Mr. Ozbilgen could not be reached for comment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pix11.com/2019/11/13/investigators-search-wooded-section-of-staten-island-in-connection-to-missing-nj-woman/">Mr. Parze said</a> that they had met Mr. Ozbilgen “a couple of times” but that the relationship “was nothing serious.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Parze’s disappearance has generated headlines around the country. Her parents have placed a large, illuminated sign outside their home, asking simply, “Stephanie Come Home.”</p>
      <p>One of her sisters, Briana, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brianna.parze/posts/3082921775069363">wrote on Facebook on Wednesday</a>, asking for help but also for others to stop posting their theories about the case: “No one knows what she is going through or where she is or who is doing this. The only person who knows anything is Stephanie and the scum who took her.”</p>
      <p>She added: “So please just keep sharing to spread the word. Send your prayers because we will find her she deserves to come home and she will.”</p>
