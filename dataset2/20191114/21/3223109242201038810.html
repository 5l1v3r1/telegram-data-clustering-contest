      <h1>‘Everwild,’ ‘Grounded,’ and ‘Tell Me Why’ Are Exclusive Xbox Signs of Life</h1>

      <p>Microsoft is really ready to reset this console generation. After the sluggish era of the Xbox One, the company is primed to take everything they’ve learned, take all of their fan-pleasing initiatives, to a new box without any DRM baggage. Besides, <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/playstation-5-vs-xbox-project-scarlett-everything-we-know-about-next-gen-consoles-1792542/">Xbox Scarlett</a> is launching with <i>Halo: Infinite</i>, so how bad could it really go?</p>
      <p>However, at the X019 Xbox fan event, we didn’t learn anything about future hardware. Instead, we learned more about future games theoretically still coming to Xbox consoles (and PCs) you can buy now. Check out these exclusives signs of Xbox life.</p>

      <p>I think it’s still arguable whether or not Nintendo selling Rare to Microsoft was really for the best. However, the celebrated developer’s fortunes do seem on the upswing following the dark days of Kinect sports or whatever. The online pirate game<i> Sea of Thieves</i> is still sailing along. And we got a first tease for the team’s upcoming project, the mysterious and beautiful <i>Everwild</i>.</p>

      <p>After rescuing themselves from the brink of bankruptcy, Obsidian is also doing pretty well these days. Microsoft bought them. And <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/review-the-outer-worlds-is-the-fallout-game-you-want-to-play-1808512/"><i>The Outer Worlds</i></a> is one of our favorite games of the year. Their newest game, <i>Grounded</i>, trades RPG systems for survival game mechanics. But don’t get too bored yet. In this <i>Pikmin</i>-esque adventure you play as a group of shrunken kids fending off against giant ants and whatnot.</p>

      <p>Dontnod isn’t an exclusive Xbox team, but the creators of <i>Life is Strange</i> are bringing their next game, <i>Tell Me Why</i>, exclusively to Microsoft. Even more historic, this episodic adventure features the first playable trans main character in a major video game.</p>
      <p>Alongside these reveals, we also got updates on upcoming Microsoft games like <i>Bleeding Edge</i> (coming next March), <i>Age of Empires 4</i>, <i>Microsoft Flight Sim</i>, <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/xbox-project-xcloud-streaming-preview-launches-this-october-1805097/">Project xCloud</a>, <i>Wasteland 3 </i>(coming next May), and <i>Minecraft Dungeons</i> (coming next April).
