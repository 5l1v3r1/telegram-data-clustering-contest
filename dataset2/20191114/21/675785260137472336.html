      <h1>Gabriel Jesus insists Man City can still land third successive Premier League title</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool's 3-1 win at Anfield on Sunday put Jurgen Klopp's side nine points clear of the reigning Premier League champions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T21:07:31+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 21:07</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Gabriel Jesus claims Manchester City can chase Liverpool down again in the title race.</p>
      <p>Jesus insists the battle for the Premier League is far from over, despite Jurgen Klopp’s side’s commanding nine-point advantage over the champions.</p>
      <p>City overturned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s seven-point lead at the turn of the year to claim the title by a single point.</p>
      <p>They also pipped Liverpool for the Premier League crown in 2014 when Brendan Rodgers’s side were in control with just three games remaining.</p>
      <p>Defiant Jesus claims City still have plenty of matches to claw back Liverpool’s lead with over two thirds of the campaign to go.</p>

      <p>“There are 26 matches left and that’s a long way out even to think who will win the Premier League,” said the Brazil striker.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool are playing really well. They were beaten only once last season, but we will take them on and keep fighting for the title again.</p>
      <p>“We will try to do our maximum and we will recover. We know we have the capacity to do this. Obviously, we want to win the championship.”</p>

      <p>Jesus has put the title race to one side to focus on Brazil’s friendly against Argentina tonight in Riyadh before they face South Korea in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Neymar is missing with a hamstring injury and Jesus claims working with Sergio Aguero can help him realise his dream of emulating the Paris St Germain star’s 61 goals for Brazil.</p>
      <p>“The dream is to follow what he has achieved,” said Jesus, who has 18 goals from his 37 caps.</p>
      <p>“But I know I have to work hard in every game, every training session for City and for Brazil, and I know I have to score goals.</p>
      <p>“I am also learning at City to do this, working with Sergio. He’s a top player, the record scorer for the club, and I can only learn from him. He scores almost every game.”</p>
      <p>Rodri is also upbeat about City and praised Pep Guardiola, claiming the Blues boss has already made him a better player.</p>
      <p>City’s record £62.8million signing, who is with Spain for Friday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Malta in Cadiz, says he is learning so much from him.</p>
      <p>“Since the beginning of the season I have added a lot of new knowledge,” said the midfielder.</p>
      <p>“It has helped me a lot that he played in the same position as me. He gives me lots of advice on how he sees football.</p>
      <p>“I’m growing a lot, not only tactically, but individually in many aspects I wasn’t aware a central midfielder should have, like driving with the ball, which is something that is demanded in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“Obviously other factors than the coach can influence things, but we have the best coach in that sense.”</p>
