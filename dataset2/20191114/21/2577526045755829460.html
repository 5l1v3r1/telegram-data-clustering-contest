      <p>Of the titles that will be available today, <i>Rage 2</i> and <i>Remnant: From the Ashes</i> are the highlights, and will be available exclusively on console along with spacefaring 4X game <i>Age of Wonders: Planetfall</i> and <i>The Lego Ninjago Movie Videogame</i>. On PC you’ll get the chance to scratch your strategy itch with<i> Age of Empires II Definitive Edition</i> and <i>Hearts of Iron IV</i>. Mysterious first-person puzzler <i>The Talos Principle</i> will be available on both console and PC, alongside the adorable <i>Tracks - The Train Set Game</i>.</p>
      <p>Those will be joined over the coming months by eight more, from indie hits like <i>The Red Strings Club, My Friend Pedro</i>, and <i>The Escapists 2</i> to juggernauts including <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> and <i>Halo: Reach</i>. If killing monsters in somewhat shonky fashion is your thing, you’ll get a chance to play <i>Darksiders III</i> across console and PC, and the list is rounded out by<i> Vambrace: Cold Soul</i> and <i>Life is Strange 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Microsoft also announced more than 30 other games heading to the service throughout 2020. Those will include new games like <i>Wasteland 3</i> and <i>Bleeding Edge</i> (as well as some newly-announced titles from Xbox Games Studios), but also classics from the Yakuza and Final Fantasy series.</p>
      <p>On top of that, Microsoft is adding a host of extra benefits to the scheme. Starting today, you can pick up three months of Game Pass for just $1 (UK price TBA), and now members in certain eligible regions will also get a month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium rolled into the membership.</p>
