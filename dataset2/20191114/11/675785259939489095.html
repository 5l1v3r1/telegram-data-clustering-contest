      <h1>You can now buy a cannabis Christmas hamper for £35</h1>
      <h2>A cannabis Christmas hamper with products made from the whole cannabis plant is now on sale, featuring CBD tea bags and bath bombs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:20:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>Still wondering what to get that loved one for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>? What better way to treat the one you love with a Christmas hamper full of cannabis products.</p>
      <p>And it's not just any cannabis products, these ones are apparently even stronger than the usual offerings, as unlike many brands that sell processed CBD products, this one uses the whole cannabis plant to extract their canniboids.</p>
      <p>That means that every product contains a full spectrum of cannabinoids, the chemical compounds found in the plant, including both CBD and its most powerful, raw form: CBDa.</p>
      <p>Made by Body and Mind Botanicals, the brand claims that these different cannabinoids work together in an ‘entourage effect’ to deliver the maximum health and wellbeing benefits, although as usual, they won't get you high.</p>

      <h3>What is CBD?</h3>
      <p>Despite cannabis itself being an illegal drug, cannabis oil, also known as cannabidiol (CBD) is legal to buy in the UK.</p>
      <p>A low-concentrate oil with a number of suggested health benefits (such as promoting sleep, reducing stress, anxiety and depression, increasing appetite and also being anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic), unlike cannabis, CBD won't get you high or impair your thought processes.</p>
      <p>Just like CBD and other cannabinoids, CBDa is also believed to sustain antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory traits, as well as reducing nausea and vomiting.</p>
