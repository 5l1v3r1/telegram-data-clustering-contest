      <p>The option form can also be submitted through the student's primary school. </p>
      <p>Submission at primary schools can be made during the following timeslots: 11am to 3pm on Nov 21 and 9am to 3pm on Nov 22, 25, 26 and 27.</p>

        <b>SCHOOL POSTING RESULTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Students will get the secondary school posting results on Dec 20 via three channels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Short Message Service (SMS) via a local mobile number;</li>
        <li>From <a href="https://beta.moe.gov.sg/secondary/s1-posting/">MOE's website</a>; or</li>
        <li>At the student's primary school.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students are to report to the secondary schools they have been posted to on Dec 23 at 8.30am.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPECIALISED SCHOOLS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Students who want to apply to specialised schools for Normal (Technical) students at Crest Secondary and Spectra Secondary can apply directly to these schools.</p>
      <p>The application period is from 11am on Nov 21 to 3pm on Nov 27. </p>
      <p>In addition, these students are also required to indicate their choices for other secondary schools under the usual posting process. </p>
