      <h1>SC's Rafale ruling: Rahul calls for Joint Parliamentary Committee probe</h1>
      <h2>Justice Kaul said the judges had reached the conclusion that it is not appropriate to order a roving inquiry into the allegations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Congress leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rahul-gandhi">Rahul Gandhi </a>on Thursday said the Supreme Court's Justice K M Joseph has left open a "huge door" for investigation into the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rafale-deal">Rafale deal </a>and demanded that a probe must begin in full earnest.</p>
      <p>He also called for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the fighter jet contract.</p>
      <p>Gandhi's remarks came after the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>gave clean chit to the Modi government on the purchase of 36 fully-loaded Rafale fighter jets from French company Dassault Aviation, rejecting the plea for registration of an FIR by the CBI for alleged commission of cognisable offence in the deal.</p>
      <p>The apex court dismissed the pleas seeking review of the December 14, 2018 verdict in which it had said that there was no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets.</p>
      <p>"We find the review petitions are without any merit," said a bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph.</p>
      <p>Reading out the judgement, Justice Kaul said the judges had reached the conclusion that it is not appropriate to order a roving inquiry into the allegations.</p>
      <p>Justice Joseph, who wrote a separate judgement, said he agreed with the main verdict written by Justice Kaul subject to certain aspects on which he has given his own reasons.</p>
      <p>"Justice Joseph of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>has opened a huge door into investigation of the Rafale scam. An investigation must now begin in full earnest. A Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) must also be set up to probe this scam," Gandhi tweeted with the hashtag 'BJP Lies On Rafale'.</p>
      <p>At a press conference, Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the BJP should stop celebration and the focus should be on investigation as the court decision has paved the way for a probe into the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rafale-deal">Rafale deal.</a></p>
      <p>He alleged that the BJP was misleading the people on the issue.</p>
