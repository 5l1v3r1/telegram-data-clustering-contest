      <p><b>JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - </b>Despite early release on a manslaughter conviction that killed two people in a fiery crash, a Jackson socialite wants a pardon.</p>
      <p>Karen Collin, known in prominent circles as Karen Irby, is appealing to the governor to clear her name.</p>
      <p>She was convicted in 2010 of two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of doctors Mark Pogue and Lisa Dedousis. She was sentenced to 18 years in prison.</p>
      <p>According to investigators, Collins was speeding after drinking when the Mercedes she was driving crossed the median and caused the fatal collision.</p>
      <p>Her husband, prominent businessman Stuart Irby, was a passenger. The two divorced while she was behind bars and he would commit suicide in January of 2012.</p>
      <p>Collins was released from prison that same year.</p>
      <p>Former Governor Haley Barbour commuted her sentence to three years house arrest and two years of Mississippi Department of Corrections supervision.</p>
      <p>In October, Collins published a Clemency Application Notice that stated she is intending to apply for an executive pardon.</p>
      <p>Her plea may be falling on deaf ears with the current governor.</p>
      <p>“Don’t plan on issuing any pardons. None,” said Governor Phil Bryant. “It’s just my belief in not having a system where one person being elected should be able to erase violent crimes."</p>
      <p>He continued, saying, “It doesn’t have anything to do with Governor Barbour or Governor Barnett or anyone else. I just don’t think that’s a system that we should use to expunge and do away with violent crimes that have occurred.”</p>
      <p>Collins spent roughly two years in prison before being released.</p>
      <p>We were unable to reach Collins’ attorney or the Pogue and Dedousis families for comment.</p>
