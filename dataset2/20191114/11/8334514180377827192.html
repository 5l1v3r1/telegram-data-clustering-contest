      <p>The Boeing 737-500 aircraft was operated by the now-defunct Tatarstan Airlines, which later had its license revoked by Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency, Rosaviatsiya.</p>
      <p>The plane from Moscow had been trying to abort its landing when it nose-dived into the runway and burst into flames. All 44 passengers and 6 crew members were killed.</p>
      <p>The son of the president of the oil-rich province of Tatarstan and the regional head of the FSB intelligence service were among those killed. The dead also included two foreigners, a Briton and a Ukrainian.</p>
      <p>Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement on Thursday it had concluded its investigation into the crash and said that pilot error was to blame.</p>
      <p>It said the aircraft’s commander, Rustem Salikhov, did not have sufficient piloting skills and had made a series of errors as had his co-pilot Viktor Gutsul.</p>
      <p>It said Salikhov had obtained his pilot’s license using falsified documents.</p>
      <p>“Salikhov, having no basic knowledge, skills and experience as a pilot, began to carry out passenger air flights as a pilot,” it said.</p>
      <p>The Investigative Committee said it had charged Valery Portnov, then-deputy general director of Tatarstan Airlines who it said had submitted Salikhov’s documents containing false information in 2009.</p>
      <p>It said he was being charged with violating air traffic safety rules resulting in the death of two or more people.</p>
      <p>The then-regional head of Rosaviatsiya in Tatarstan, Shavkat Umarov, was charged with negligence.</p>
      <p>Kazan, which is 800 km (500 miles) east of Moscow, is the capital of the mainly Muslim region of Tatarstan.</p>
