      <p>Cape Town - <b>England </b>boss <b>Gareth Southgate</b> has confirmed he will recall <b>Raheem Sterling</b> for the <b>2020 European Championship</b> qualifier in Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Southgate suspects the forward has the hump with him after being axed for the qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Only a point is needed against the Group A minnows to secure qualification for the finals and Thursday’s encounter at Wembley will also see the Three Lions celebrate becoming the first nation to play 1 000 international matches.</p>
      <p>Much of the talk, however, has focused on a fracas rather than football in the build-up following Sterling’s exchange with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez less than 24 hours after the pair clashed towards the end of Manchester City’s 3-1 loss at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The English Football Association announced late on Monday night that the 24-year-old would not be considered to face Montenegro as a result, with the forward making private and public apologies after emotions got the better of him.</p>
      <p>While Southgate feels it may have caused a temporary rift in his relationship with Sterling, he insists he is ready to restore one of his key men in the final qualifier in Prishtina on Sunday.</p>
      <p>When asked if he would be ready to turn to Sterling in Kosovo, Southgate said: "Yes. Without knowing what might happen in tomorrow's game and everything else, but I can see it."</p>
      <p>Then when asked if he had any hesitation in making such a decision, he added: "None, none whatsoever.</p>
      <p>"As I have said, we take the decision and drew a line under everything. We move forward now, the way he’s trained has been exemplary, so that's it."</p>
      <p>Sterling has been outstanding for both City and England this season and it will be interesting to see how the Three Lions cope without him tonight.</p>
