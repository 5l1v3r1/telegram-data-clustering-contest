      <h2>India's gem &amp; jewellery industry exports a third of its diamonds to Hong Kong</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:05:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rajesh Bhayani</a></address>
      <p>Pro-democracy protests in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>have upset the plans of India’s gem &amp; jewellery industry, which exports a third of its diamonds to the Chinese-controlled city.</p>
      <p>Exports had already fallen by 15.5 per cent to $4.9 billion in the first half of 2019 and the months-long unrest has proved another headache for an industry already suffering because of domestic issues like delay in goods and services tax (GST) refunds, scarce working capital and the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy protesters swarmed parts of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>for a fourth day on Thursday, forcing schools to close and blocking highways as students built barricades and stockpiled makeshift weapons, setting the stage for campus showdowns.</p>
      <p>Jewellery industry observers said exports might improve in two months, but they were downbeat about long-term prospects.</p>
      <p>"Disturbances in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>are now hurting demand ahead of Chinese New Year, which is traditionally a big occasion similar to Christmas and Thanksgiving Day in the western world,” said Colin Shah, vice-chairman of the Gem and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council.</p>
      <p>According to provisional data from the Gem &amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council, overall gross export of gems &amp; jewellery declined by only 2.05 per cent to $3.46 billion in October 2019, compared with $3.5 billion in the same month a year earlier. In September, the decline was 6.24 per cent and in August the fall was 14.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>In the first 7 months of 2019, gross exports of gold and jewellery fell 6.25 per cent to $22.42 billion, compared with 7.6 per cent in first six months. More importantly, the fall in export of cut and polished diamonds seems to have been somewhat arrested. The exports saw a decline of 24.86 per cent to $1.64 billion in August, and 17.8 per cent to $1.94 billion in September. In October, it was down 15.4 per cent to $1.95 billion, showing a marginal recovery.</p>
      <p>Even if exports improve before Christmas, “the financial year exports could end with fall around 5-7 per cent in total exports. As of now, USA market has improved but the Hong Kong disturbances have hurt Chinese new Year (a month after Christmas) demand,” said the Council.</p>
      <p>The domestic market had a huge unsold inventory of polished diamonds when the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong-protests">Hong Kong protests </a>began, but there is good <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/markets-news-1060101.htm">news </a>on that front. Following a fall in rough diamond prices last month, De Beers allowed their registered buyers known as Sightholders to dispose of diamond inventory before accepting quantities offered.</p>
      <p>A DeBeers spokesperson said: “As part of its normal sales policy, the De Beers group enables sightholders to request that certain elements of rough diamond 'boxes' (the products we sell that contain a range of diamonds) are removed before the sightholder purchases the box. In recent sights, due to the challenges in the industry's midstream, De Beers Group adjusted the proportion of a box that could be removed before the box was purchased, although this was not 'unsold rough diamonds being sold back'. This is not a new process and has been in place for many years.”</p>
      <p>Industry sources said that since domestic situation had improved now, the company would not offer this facility next month.</p>
