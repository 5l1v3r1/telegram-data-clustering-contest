      <p>An Taisce’s Green Schools programme has teamed up with Irish Water for a seventh year to support schools working to gain a Green Flag under the water theme.</p>
      <p>The water theme aims to increase awareness of water conservation among primary and secondary school students. In Mayo, 16 schools across the county are currently working on the water theme.</p>
      <p>This academic year, just over 97,000 students and 8,000 teachers around the country will undertake the Green Schools water theme in their school. As part of Irish Water’s sponsorship of the water theme schools will be invited to attend water workshops, take part in the annual poster competition, apply to be Water Ambassadors and, following their application for the Green Flag, all schools are in with a chance to be named Ireland’s Water School of the Year 2020.</p>
      <p>Students from Irishtown National School, Claremorris, joined Green Schools and Irish Water to launch the seventh year of partnership. In May, two Irishtown NS students - sisters Lucy and Grace McDermott - won regional and national prizes in the annual Green Schools Irish Water poster competition for their artistic efforts.</p>
      <p>This year’s poster competition theme is ‘Let’s Take Climate Action for Water’ and is inspired by the theme for UN World Water Day 2020, Water &amp; Climate. The competition asks students to create posters focused on water and our changing climate. Secondary school students will also be able to enter a group video - a new element to this year’s competition.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, this year’s ambassador programme for secondary schools has seen high levels of applicants as students become more focused on climate action and helping their environment. Training days for successful applicants began in early November and they focus on equipping students with as much water-based knowledge as possible alongside communication skills training and a visit to a water treatment plant.</p>
      <p>Water workshops for primary and secondary schools in 22 locations around Ireland have also started for this academic year. These workshops focus on peer to peer learning and the invited students leave with action plans and resources to assist them in undertaking the water theme in their school.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the partnership, Toni Bourke of Irish Water said: “Irish Water is delighted to continue our sponsorship of the Green Schools programme and particularly the water themed flag. Irish Water is delighted to be working with young people in schools throughout Ireland through the Green Schools programme to encourage new and innovative ideas about water use and water conservation.</p>
      <p>“Through this education, awareness and action-based programme we can improve and secure this precious resource that is vital to the environmental, social and economic life of this country for future generations. Let’s continue the conversation about conservation.”</p>
      <p>Cathy Baxter, Green Schools manager, added: “We are delighted to be celebrating the seventh year of our partnership with Irish Water. The support we’ve received has allowed us to create and develop resources, events and ongoing initiatives to assist schools as best we can with their work on our water theme.</p>
      <p>“The fruits of this can be seen in schools like our award winning schools each year, who have achieved incredibly low water use and a strong school-wide culture of water conservation.”</p>
