      <h1>Suicide rates fall after gay marriage legalised in Sweden and Denmark</h1>

        <i>Rate among those in same-sex unions falls by 46%, but still ‘worryingly high’, say researchers</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/suicide-rates">Suicide rates</a> among those in same-sex relationships have fallen significantly in both Denmark and Sweden since the legalisation of gay marriage, according to a study, although whatever their marital status, homosexual people remain more likely to take their own life.</p>
      <p>The joint study by the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention and researchers from Stockholm University compared suicide rates for people in same-sex and heterosexual relationships in the periods 1989-2002 and 2003-16.</p>
      <p>Denmark became the first country in the world to allow same-sex civil partnerships in 1989, with neighbouring Sweden following six years later. Same-sex marriage, now authorised in 28 countries, became legal in Sweden in 2009 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/denmark">Denmark</a> in 2012.</p>
      <p>The researchers found that between the two periods, the number of suicides among people in same-sex unions fell by 46%, compared to a decline of about 28% in the number of suicides by people in heterosexual relationships.</p>
      <p>“Although suicide rates in the general populations of Denmark and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden">Sweden</a> have been decreasing in recent decades, the rate for those living in same-sex marriage declined at a steeper pace, which has not been noted previously,” the study, which followed 28,000 people in same-sex partnerships for an average of 11 years, concludes.</p>
      <p>Annette Erlangsen, the lead author, suggested that along with other gay rights legislation, same-sex marriage may have reduced feelings of social stigmatisation among some homosexual people. “Being married is protective against suicide,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nordics-lgbt-health-trfn/suicides-fall-with-gay-marriage-in-sweden-denmark-as-stigma-fades-idUSKBN1XO010">she told Thomson Reuters Foundation</a>.</p>
      <p>But she noted that the study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, still showed that more than twice as many people in same-sex marriages and unions killed themselves than those in opposite-sex marriages.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it is positive to see that the suicide rate has almost halved. But it remains worryingly high, especially considering that the suicide rate may be higher among non-married people,” <a href="https://www.information.dk/indland/2019/11/stor-undersoegelse-kaster-nyt-lys-paa-selvmord-blandt-homoseksuelle">she told the Danish newspaper Information.</a></p>
      <p>According to a 2018 report comparing 35 studies from 10 countries, young LGBT+ people are <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-lgbt-teen-suicide/lgbt-youth-at-higher-risk-for-suicide-attempts-idUKKCN1MI1SL">at least three times more likely</a> to attempt suicide than straight people of the same age, although the risk may be reduced by pro-equality legislation.</p>
      <p>Despite Scandinavia’s reputation as a progressive leader on LGBT+ rights, a study published last month revealed that almost one third of Danish men considered sex between two men to be morally wrong.</p>
