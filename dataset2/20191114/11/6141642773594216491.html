      <p>Authorities have barred the wife of a former British army officer who founded the White Helmets volunteer group from leaving Turkey pending the investigation into his death, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Turkey’s state-run news agency reported that James Le Mesurier’s Swedish wife, Emma Winberg, was questioned by police on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Authorities imposed the travel ban in case she needs to be questioned again, according to Anadolu Agency.</p>
      <p>Mr Le Mesurier was found dead outside his Istanbul home on November 11. Police believe he fell to his death and are investigating the circumstances.</p>
