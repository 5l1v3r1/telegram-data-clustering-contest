      <h1>The talented Man Utd youngster Wales fans are yet to see and the transfer decision he faces at Old Trafford</h1>
      <h2>He's got a bright future ahead of him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:42:41+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Mitchelmore</a></address>
      <p>He's one of two uncapped players in Wales' 27-man squad for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers with Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>
      <p>And Dylan Levitt is a name members of the Red Wall can expect to hear plenty more about in the future.</p>
      <p>The Bodelwyddan-born youngster - who turns 19 during the international break - signed a new long-term contract with Manchester United last week, with his new deal set to keep him at Old Trafford until 2022 while the Red Devils also have the option to extend that by one year.</p>
      <p>He's clearly highly rated by those in Manchester, and the same applies when it comes to the coaching staff at the FAW.</p>
      <p>Levitt impressed during Wales' training camps in Cardiff and the Algarve region of Portugal earlier this year, so much so that Ryan Giggs called him up to the Red Dragons' senior squad for the June double-header against Croatia and Hungary.</p>
      <p>Speaking in May, Giggs said: "I know more about Dylan because he is at United.</p>
      <p>"I have spoken to (Nicky) Butty about him a few times, seen him a few times live on TV and in person.</p>
      <p>"He is similar to (Manchester City and Wales player) Matty Smith â€“ he wants to get the ball down, wants to pass and get in different positions.</p>
      <p>"He impressed me last week and that is why he is in the squad."</p>
      <p>Despite not getting any minutes under his belt for the senior team in 2019, Levitt harbours hopes of making his bow in the current international break.</p>
      <p>And Wales Under-21s manager Paul Bodin admits there's every chance Levitt could feature against either Azerbaijan or Hungary, particularly with Joe Allen being suspended against the former.</p>

      <p>"Dylan Levitt dropped down to us for the last game and did really well in Moldova, he was one of the shining lights," said Bodin.</p>
      <p>"With Joe Allen out, he's gone back up to the senior squad so it gives another player the opportunity to come into the under-21s. We wish Dyl well but obviously we wish he was with us.</p>
      <p>"He's 19 during the next camp. I'm sure his mum will bring a cake along to the seniors as she did in the under-19s group last year!"</p>
      <p>Levitt is yet to make his first-team debut for Manchester United, although he is a regular in their under-23s' side.</p>
      <p>And former Wales international Bodin admits the youngster now needs to make the step up to senior football to further develop his game.</p>

      <p>"He's a great player. What he has to do now at some stage is get some senior football at club level," added Bodin.</p>
      <p>"Whether that's going out on loan or breaking into the first team and Manchester United, whether he can do that I'm not quite sure yet.</p>
      <p>"But he's young and he's an incredible potential as Ryan has obviously realised.</p>
      <p>"The fact he's gone back up against having dropped down to us shows he's more than capable.</p>
      <p>"But at some stage he will need some senior exposure and hopefully he could even make his debut in the next campaign.</p>
      <p><b>"</b> He has progressed quite well. He plays under-23s football regularly and probably at his age and at a club like Man United, that is good progression.</p>
      <p>"But at some stage, probably in the next 18 months, I'm sure that (possible loan move) will be something that's discussed."</p>
      <p>Wales take on Azerbaijan at Baku's Bakcell Arena on Saturday, November 16 before ending their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign against Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium three days later.</p>
      <p>The under-21s battle it out with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina in a Euro qualifier at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
