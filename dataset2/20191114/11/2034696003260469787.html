      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/slipknot">Slipknot’s</a> <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/corey-taylor">Corey Taylor</a> has opened about excess in music, saying you don’t need drink and drugs to create.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://marshall.com/live-for-music/the-marshall-podcast">Marshall Podcast,</a> Taylor said he prefers to create without drink and drugs after hearing himself back on record when “loaded” in the studio.</p>
      <p>Taylor said: “I think it’s encouraged by the people who are actually embedded in that…They want people to think that it’s hard to create without chemicals. And that’s addict language, because I used to do that for me from a performing standpoint.</p>
      <p>“I was convinced that I couldn’t perform if I didn’t have a Jack and Coke — at least one…And then that became two. And then that became half a bottle. That’s addiction. So I think that’s a myth perpetuated by addicts who are looking for people to reinforce their dependency.”</p>

      <p>Speaking about hearing himself back on record after being “loaded”, Taylor said: “I have only been loaded in the studio twice, and I didn’t like it one bit, ‘cause I couldn’t control anything.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “And then listening back to shit, I was, like, ‘Oh, this is horrible. Why did I do that?’ So, I’ve really tried to kind of kill that myth for people.”</p>
      <p>Taylor went on to say he doesn’t judge people either for their choices. He added: “It is not the law of the land. You don’t have to be loaded to fucking create. You don’t have to be loaded to fucking have a good time.</p>
      <p>“I actually think you sound better and play better and you have a better energy when you’re not. Because then the focus is on you. There are no excuses after that. It’s you, and that’s the rawness of what we do.”</p>
      <p>Last month (October 29), <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slipknot-tease-theyre-trying-something-new-with-new-video-nero-forte-2562322">Slipknot teased they were “trying something new”</a> while shooting the official video for their single ‘Nero Forte’, the band’s Shawn ‘Clown’ Crahan has revealed.</p>
