      <p>Eintracht Frankfurt have lost their appeal against a ban on fans attending the Europa League tie at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga club had been charged by governing body UEFA following incidents during the Group F fixture against Vitoria in Portugal.</p>
      <p>The disciplinary action was for throwing of objects, crowd disturbances, act of damages and a late kick-off.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt had already been under a suspended sanction from previous breaches, and so UEFA imposed the ban on sale of tickets for the match in London on November 28 as well as one additional European fixture.</p>
      <p>The Germans lodged an appeal against the ruling, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>“The appeal of Eintracht Frankfurt against the judgement of the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Commission of 17 October 2019 was rejected by the competent chamber last night,” a club statement read.</p>
      <p>“As a result, the ‘cut-off penalty’ for the game at Arsenal FC on 28 November in London continues.”</p>
