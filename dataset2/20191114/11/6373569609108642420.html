      <p>Six men have been arrested by specialist police tasked with tackling organised crime groups in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Officers from Plymouth’s Proactive Converter Team carried out a series of searches late last night at a number of addresses in the Efford area.</p>
      <p>The searches came after a car was stop checked and searched in Plymouth last night. Two men - the driver and a passenger -  were arrested which in turn led to search warrants being executed at properties in Dartmeet Avenue, Embankment Road, Higher Efford Road, Stour Close and Efford Walk. </p>
      <p>By the end of the night’s work the team had seized what they have described as “several thousand pounds worth" of suspected class A drugs - cocaine and MDMA - as well as a quantity of class B cannabis. Police also seized a large amount of cash suspected of being the proceeds of criminal activities.</p>
      <p>Officer say they have also seized what they believe to be an industrial press and it is suspected this may have been used to ‘press’ the cocaine into tightly-sealed packs for transportation.</p>
      <p>Six men – aged 53, 50, 29, 28 and two aged 27 – were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs and money laundering. They were taken to Charles Cross custody suite where they await interview. Police say all six men are from the Efford area.</p>
