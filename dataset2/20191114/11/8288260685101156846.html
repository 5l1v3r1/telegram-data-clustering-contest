      <h1>General Election 2019: Redditch candidates for Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and others</h1>
      <h2>The Redditch seat is located in Worcestershire and contains the whole borough of Redditch and parts of the district of Wychavon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:38:55+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Regen, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/charlotte-regen/</a></address>
      <p>An election is coming, meaning voters in Redditch will soon voice who they want to run the country.</p>
      <p>Before Parliament was dissolved, the constituency was represented by the Conservatives - with Rachael Maclean as the MP.</p>
      <p>Redditch has been a Conservative constituency since the 2010 general election, when Karen Lumley nudged out Jacqui Smith.</p>
      <p>Since then the party has held the seat and secured 5.2 per cent of the votes in the last election.</p>
      <p>Rachel Maclean who was the latest MP is also the party's selected candidate for this year's election.</p>
      <p>The candidates are</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Labour - Rebecca Jenkins</li>
        <li/>
        <li>Liberal Democrats - Bruce Horton</li>
        <li/>
        <li>Conservatives - Rachel Maclean</li>
        <li/>
        <li>Green - Claire Davies</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why are we having an early election?</h3>
      <p>A general election - which determines who runs the country - normally happens every five years.</p>
      <p>There are 650 constituencies, where voters are invited to select an MP to represent their area.</p>
      <p>Nearly three-and-a-half years ago voters were called to the ballot box to decide whether the UK should remain in or leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>The majority chose to leave and we were supposed to have left on March, 29 this year, however, it has since been delayed after MPs failed to back plans put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May and now Boris Johnson.</p>
