      <h1>Anger after distressed stag found tangled in discarded plastic has to be put to sleep</h1>
      <h2>It is thought the stag had been grazing on seaweed on the idyllic island's shoreline when the plastic banding caught on his antlers.</h2>

      <p>These shocking pictures show a beautiful <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/animals">stag</a> which died after it was found with its antlers wrapped - in a mass of discarded plastic strapping.</p>
      <p>The distressed animal was discovered tangled in the plastic waste on a hillside on the west coast of Jura, Inner Hebrides, yesterday.</p>
      <p>It is thought the stag had been grazing on seaweed on the idyllic island's shoreline when the plastic banding caught on his antlers.</p>
      <p>He then walked around a mile onto the hillside, where he has been starving for the last week as the plastic was wrapped around his mouth.</p>
      <p>The beautiful animal was discovered by shocked gamekeeper, Scott Muir, 32, who said the stag sadly had to be put to sleep.</p>

      <p>Scott, who has lived on the island - with a population of just 230 - all his life, said plastic pollution on the coast has increasingly worsened in the last five years.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was walking over the estate when I saw the plastic waste and realised there was a stag caught.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was dead at first but as I approached it I could see his head start to move.</p>
      <p>"These can be 18st animals and I know how powerful they can be, but he looked tired and stressed and he couldn't see because the plastic was right around his antlers.</p>
      <p>"He wouldn't have been able to graze either as it was right over his mouth, so he was effectively starving.</p>
      <p>"He would have been down at the shore grazing on seaweed, like a lot of the stags do, and as he has had his antlers down they have caught in the plastic banding.</p>
      <p>"It looks like he has then walked about a mile up onto the hillside, no mean feat considering it was tangled around his back leg as well as round his antlers.</p>
      <p>"I think he has been there for about a week. In the end the animal had to sadly be dispatched."</p>

      <p>Scott is also a volunteer with Wild Side of Jura, a group aiming to protect the west coast and raise awareness to stop plans for a potential fish farm being built.</p>
      <p>Scott said: "We are a group of five or six volunteers who came together to protect the west coast of Jura and raise awareness of a fish farm which is trying to be built here.</p>
      <p>"The plastic pollution is getting worse. We have seen an increase in plastic waste on the west coast in the last five, six years.</p>
      <p>"The plastic on the stag is not fishing net but plastic banding which is used in conjunction with fishing.</p>
      <p>"We can't categorically say where it came from but I'd be willing to bet some sort of commercial <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fishing">fishing</a> , fish farm, which is what we are trying to stop on the west coast of Jura."</p>
      <p>Anger locals took to social media to voice their outrage.</p>
      <p>One said: "That's shocking, poor animal, the thought of him struggling with that for hours makes me so angry.</p>
      <p>"So much plastic out there, it makes it much more of a reality when you see the damage it does so close to home."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Poor thing, what an awful sight. I can't believe how loosely regulated boats are it's dreadful."</p>
      <p>Someone else added: "Whoever threw that, and more, overboard obviously do not care about the consequences of their actions.</p>
      <p>"Out of sight, out of mind. What a terrible plight for an innocent creature."</p>
