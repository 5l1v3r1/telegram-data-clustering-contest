      <h1>Man Utd set date for Paul Pogba injury return - and are targeting crunch clash</h1>
      <h2>Pogba has been sidelined since the end of September after aggravating a long-standing ankle issue in Utd's 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:13:38+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are hoping to have Paul Pogba fit for their crunch Premier League showdown with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> next month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fifa-world-cup">World Cup</a> winner has been sidelined since the end of September after aggravating a long-standing ankle issue in Utd's 1-1 draw at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> .</p>
      <p>During the international break in October, the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> man headed to Dubai for some warm weather training in a bid to get over the niggle, but was unable to do so.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/france-football-team">France</a> international subsequently had a cast fitted around his ankle in order to aid his recovery and the 26-year-old passed a huge landmark in his rehabilitation on Monday.</p>

      <p>After having his cast removed this week, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10341763/paul-pogba-injury-return-man-utd-city-derby-december/">The Sun</a> has claimed that United have targeted the Manchester derby as his return date.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side travel to the Etihad to face their fierce rivals on December 7.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun: “Ole wants to reintroduce him off the bench in the game if at all possible.</p>
      <p>“He has kept himself pretty fit in terms of his core fitness. He’s always in top shape, to be honest.”</p>

      <p>Pogba travelled to Amsterdam this week to have the cast removed and recorded the procedure, with the clip later uploaded to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman could be seen smiling as the cast was taken off using a drill, no doubt knowing a frustrating period in his career will soon be over.</p>
      <p>However, the 26-year-old is still a few weeks away from making a playing return with Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer himself admitting earlier this month that Pogba will likely not be back until early December.</p>
      <p>In Pogba's absence, Scott McTominay and Fred have begun building a good partnership in the heart of the pitch for the Red Devils and the Frenchman may have a battle on his hand to regain his starting spot.</p>
