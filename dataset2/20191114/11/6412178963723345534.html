        <b>Juventus’ sporting director Fabio Paratici is in London to discuss a move for <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mario-mandzukic">Mario Mandzukic</a> with Manchester United, according to <i>Calciomercato.</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>Paratici though is also in the U.K. to sound out any other potential buyers for the 33-year-old Croatian, with the Italian source claiming Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham are also interested in signing Mandzukic in January.</p>
      <p>Last month Juve boss Maurizio Sarri hinted that Mandzukic was going to be offloaded in January, Sarri said: “In this moment Mario Mandzukic is not training with the group due to an agreement he has with the club.”</p>

          <b>The experienced forward has been linked with a move away from Turin ever since he was omitted from Sarri’s Champions League squad. In fact United tried to sign the player before that, but failed to get a move completed for him in August.</b>

      </p>
      <p>The latest report claims United are in pole position to sign Mandzukic, but discussions are expected to be complicated with Juve wanting €15m and United only willing to pay €10m.</p>
      <p><i>Football Italia</i> and <i>Tuttosport</i> report that Mandzukic has chosen United and could move in December in a bid to settle in ahead of a January 1 move, but Paratici is also on the lookout for other suitors in case United representatives cannot agree a deal.</p>
      <p>Mandzukic has not kicked a ball this season, but played 25 matches in Serie A for Juventus last season, scoring nine goals.</p>
