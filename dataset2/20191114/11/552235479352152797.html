      <h1>Currys PC World kicks off Black Friday 2019 with early bird offers</h1>
      <h2>The first offers are now live with the tech giant dropping its prices on Nintendo Switch bundles, Dyson V8 vacuums, LG smart 4K HD TVs and more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:40:50+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Chantelle Symester</a></address>
      <p>Back Friday is officially on November 29.</p>
      <p>But that hasn’t stopped a whole host of top retailers setting out their stalls and showing off their sales goods with some cracking early bird offers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2L9VnUc">Currys PC World</a> has been teasing massive price drops since last week, hinting at offers that will be hard to match.</p>
      <p>And earlier this week, the tech giant was briefly selling a new Apple iPad for £4!</p>
      <p>The pricing glitch was caused by a system error and meant shoppers received an astonishing £285 discount.</p>
      <p>The deal appeared in online baskets when ahoppers used the discount code FREECASE - designed to offer customers a free £30 case when they bought the 9.7 inch 2018 Apple iPad (32GB).</p>
      <p>The iPad usually carries a price tag of £319 – although it has now been reduced to £289 in the early bird Black Friday sale.</p>

      <p>Top brands like Dyson, Nintendo, LG and more feature in the deals, which will continue throughout November.</p>
      <p>Highlights for the first wave of discounts include £100 off the Dyson V8 Cord-free vacuum cleaners, now £299 and £45 off the best-selling Nintendo Switch with Pokemon Sword or Shield game bundles, now £279.</p>
