      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Recent news of violence in Mexico has been in the headlines, most recently a gruesome murder of nine women and children that happened last week.<br/><br/>The family was ambushed by a heavily armed group while traveling from the town of Bavispe in Sonora state to Galeana in Chihuahua state.<br/><br/>A few weeks before that, the attempted capture of El Chapo's son touched off deadly violence in Culiacan in Sinaloa Cartel territory.<br/><br/>But those incidents happened in more isolated areas.<br/><br/>And most tourists tend to visit destinations like Mexico City and coastal resorts, like Cozumel and Cancun.<br/><br/>Eyewitness News spoke with a travel agent and security expert to get their perspective on what tourists should know if they're planning a trip to Mexico.<br/><br/>Caroline Reinhard-Chacon is the owner and manager at Travel Leaders in Montebello.<br/><br/>She commented on the recent incidents that have been in the news.<br/><br/>"It overall adds that perception that Mexico isn't a safe place to visit even though the violence is in very isolated areas, in contained areas," she said.<br/><br/>Homicide rates in Mexico have increased by 36% since 2015, reaching an all-time high. The U.S. State Department is warning tourists not to travel to the states of Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Michoacan, Colima and Guerrero.<br/><br/>"If you're afraid, you shouldn't go, it's your vacation. It's your money. But those people who do go have a great time and do feel safe," Reinhard-Chacon said.<br/><br/>She adds that the most popular tourist cities in Mexico are generally safe.<br/><br/>"But if you go to beach destinations and you exercise caution, you use your common sense, I think you could have a wonderful time in Mexico," Reinhard-Chacon said.<br/><br/>According to Mexican government's data, the number of tourists increased 78% between 2010 and 2018.<br/><br/>Eyewitness News spoke with former Los Angeles County Sheriff and ABC7 law enforcement analyst, Jim McDonnell.<br/><br/>"It's worthwhile considering certainly, anytime you plan on going anywhere, do your homework ahead of time," McDonnell said. "Because when we say Mexico, well Mexico is a big country. There are parts of it that are very safe, and there are parts of it that are not safe at all."<br/><br/>McDonnell recommends visiting the U.S. State Department's <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html">website</a>, and practicing situational awareness.<br/><br/>"Not being conspicuous, not standing out. Not wearing conspicuous, expensive jewelry. Those kinds of things make you a target," he explained.<br/><br/>McDonnell advises: the more planning, the better.<br/><br/>"Educate yourself before you go there, and as best you can, prepare yourself for the worst," McDonnell said. "And hope for the best."</p>
