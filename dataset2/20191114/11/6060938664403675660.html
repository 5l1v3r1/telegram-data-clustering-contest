      <h1>‘Rock On!!’ actor Luke Kenny looks unrecognisable as Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in Tanhaji poster!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:01:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Ajay Devgn revealed several character posters from his upcoming period drama ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’. He shared a striking poster of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sharad-Kelkar">Sharad Kelkar</a> as Chhatrapati Shivaji and Padmavati Rao as Chhatrapati Shivaji's mother Jijamata. However what caught our attention was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Luke-Kenny">Luke Kenny</a> as he posed as Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The caption of his character poster read, "Aurangzeb Mughal Emperor - Hum mukkamal Hindustan ko fateh karne ka irada rakhte hain." (We plan to conquer Hindustan).</p>

      <p>Luke has transformed massively from his popular character in ‘Rock On!!’. The actor played a lively rock band member in the musical but going by his Aurangzeb avatar, Luke has undergone a massive makeover for the period drama. With an intense gaze and a focused vision, Luke makes an impact as the Mughal warrior.</p>
      <p>'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior' will focus on the Sinhagad battle wherein <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tanhaji">Tanhaji</a> sacrificed his life and bravely fought against Udaybhan, who was leading the Mughals. With Ajay Devgn playing the titular role, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saif-Ali-Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> as the antagonist and a promising supporting cast, there is a lot of expectation from this period drama. Directed by Om Raut and produced by Ajay Devgn, 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior' is scheduled to hit the screens on January 10, 2020 and will clash at the box office with Deepika Padukone starrer ‘Chhapaak’.</p>
