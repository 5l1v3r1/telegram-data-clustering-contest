      <h1>Resume work - Judicial Service Management urges staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:44:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">Joyce Danso</a></address>
      <p>Accra Nov. 14, GNA - The Management of the Judicial Service has asked members of the Judicial Service Staff Association of Ghana (JUSAG) to call off its indefinite nationwide strike and resume work with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>A statement signed by Ms Cynthia Pamela A. Addo, Judicial Secretary, also asked all Judges and Magistrates to resume work.</p>
      <p>The statement said all courts would thus  be functional and  opened for service.</p>
      <p>"The Management of the Judicial Service has noted with concern that although on November 12, 2019, the National Labour Commission described the strike action as illegal, JUSAG went ahead with the strike on November 13,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>“We therefore call on all staff of the Judicial Service to resume with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>“Judges and Magistrates are requested to attend to work as usual”.</p>
      <p>JUSAG last week served notices that it would embark on the industrial action over non action of  salary reviews  and negotiations for staff of the Service, which were recommended by the Committee set up by the Judicial Council.</p>
      <p>It also complained about not being copies of the relevant report in spite of making several demands.</p>
      <p>The NLC , however, meeting with JUSAG on November 12, this year,  cautioned that the intended  strike was illegal.</p>
      <p>JUSAG, however, called the strike on November 13, leaving the court rooms locked up.</p>
