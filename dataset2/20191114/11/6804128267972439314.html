      <h1>Antonio's return and the Spurs factor - How West Ham can improve after the international break</h1>
      <h2>It's all a bit doom and gloom in east London at the moment but there are ways it can get better</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:25:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>There is fair bit of negativity around West Ham at the moment and rightly so.</p>
      <p>Results have not been good enough, the squad is badly underperforming, there have been some truly poor results and the dramatic downturn in fortunes has seen the team drop to 16th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Manager Manuel Pellegrini has yet to find an answer to a slide that has been going on for nearly two months - the Hammers haven't won a single game since beating Manchester United on September 22.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Chilean is under pressure to improve results ahead a of a tough-looking run of fixtures. While his job isn't under any immediate threat, there are some concerns behind the scenes over the terrible form and how some of the summer recruits are struggling to get going in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But is it all doom and gloom? At the moment, yes it is, but are there any signs on the horizon that things could get better?</p>
      <h4>The return of Michail Antonio</h4>
      <p>A lot is being pinned on the return of the winger who should hopefully inject some much needed pace and power into what is a very lacklustre and slow West Ham side at the moment.</p>
      <p>Antonio has been absent thanks to hamstring surgery since late August and he has been sorely missed, not only for his abilities as a winger but also as a player who can get up and support the isolated Sebastien Haller.</p>

      <p>It's that latter point that may prove crucial as the French striker has looked very lonely up front as Pellegrini's tactics don't suit him and his style of play.</p>
      <p>Antonio coming back into the side should help improve the team. While the winger is explosive and dynamic, they do have to be careful with him as this most recent hamstring injury was his third in recent years.</p>
      <p>But Antonio is a difference maker, likely coming off the bench against Spurs you would imagine, but his return could not be coming at a better time for a floundering Hammers team.</p>
      <h4>The Spurs factor</h4>
      <p>The Hammers players should up their levels for the visit of bitter rivals Spurs to London Stadium for the first game after the international break in E20. If the manager get them up for this game then there is a real problem.</p>
      <p>West Ham beat Spurs in their own backyard last season, becoming the first team to do so since they moved to their new Â£1bn behemoth stadium in north London and it went down an absolute treat among the fans.</p>
      <p>There are also reports that should the Hammers win next weekend then Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino could well find hinself out of a job after Tottenham's poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>Spurs at home is the perfect game for Pellegrini's side to get back on the wagon as Pochettino's side haven't won on the road in the Premier League since January.</p>
      <h4>West Ham played better against big teams last season</h4>

      <p>Clutching at straws? Maybe but it was the case that in 2018/19, West Ham turned up on the big occasions more often than not.</p>
      <p>Aside from the 4-0 whacking at Liverpool on the opening day of last season, the Hammers played well against the so-called big boys. They beat Manchester United at home and were robbed at Old Trafford when losing 2-1, drew with Liverpool in east London, were harshly beaten 1-0 at Manchester City and drew with Chelsea at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>While Spurs have tailed off this season, they are still one of the big boys and especially away from home, they are there for the taking. The Hammers swatted aside Man Utd in Stratford earlier this season but their form of the last campaign should, hopefully, give some confidence to a squad that is sorely lacking it at the moment.</p>
