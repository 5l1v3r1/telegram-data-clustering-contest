      <p>MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. -- The U.S. Coast Guard called off the search Wednesday for the two boaters after their boat overturned days ago.</p>
      <p>They were part of a trio who had left the Key Largo area last Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard says there was a third boater with them. That person was rescued Sunday night by a good Samaritan boater.</p>
      <p>The survivor, 31-year-old Adnan Diaz, says he'd left the other two on the boat when he went to swim for help after their boat capsized near MIami on Friday.</p>
      <p>The missing have been identified as 38-year-old Luis Rivas Engrova and 26-year-old Ylianet Iba√±ez of Naples.</p>
      <p>More than 10,000 square miles were searched.</p>
