      <p>Senegal’s push to reach a second consecutive AFCON final began in midweek, as they hosted Congo in the first qualifier for the 2021 tournament.</p>
      <p>Mane, who was the first of Liverpool’s internationals in action during the November break, started in attack as Aliou Cisse presided over an altered setup from the 1-0 loss to Algeria in July.</p>
      <p>Kalidou Koulibaly wore the captain’s armband, having inherited it from Cheikhou Kouyate, and Metz striker Habib Diallo started ahead of Mbaye Niang up front.</p>
      <p>The Lions of Teranga dominated, with 62 percent of possession and six shots on goal to Congo’s four, with two of their efforts finding the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Sidy Sarr opened the scoring in the 26th minute, and two minutes later Diallo clinched the result for 2-0, heading home from Mane’s cross from the left.</p>
      <p>Mane played 84 minutes, replaced by Niang in the closing stages, and applauded the Senegal supporters after the game to mark a positive start to the campaign:</p>

      <p>Next up is a trip to Eswatini on Sunday, with Senegal’s upcoming opponents losing 3-0 to Guinea-Bissau earlier on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It is likely Mane will start again at the Mavuso Sports Centre, with his importance to Cisse’s side undeniable as one of the best players in world football.</p>
      <p>Liverpool should see it as a positive that his international duty ends so early, with Mane then able to return to Melwood with plenty of time to prepare for the away clash with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> next Saturday.</p>
