      <p>On December 12, voters will flock to polling stations across the Dudley North constituency.</p>
      <p>Ian Austin was the incumbent for Dudley North but now the party has selected a new candidate.</p>
      <p>Austin has been the MP for the constituency since 2005 after taking Ross Cranston's place.</p>
      <p>However, Melanie Dudley will now takeover as Labour's new candidate.</p>
      <p>Labour first won their seat back in the 1997 general election, with 5.2 per cent of votes.</p>
      <p>Despite seeing a fluctuation in voters, the party have managed to keep their seat.</p>
      <p>Also in the running for Dudley North's seat is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conservatives - Marco Longhi</li>
        <li>Liberal Democrats -  Ian Flynn</li>
        <li>Brexit Party -  Rupert Lowe</li>
        <li>Green - Mike Harrison</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why are we having an early election?</h3>
      <p>A general election - which determines who runs the country - normally happens every five years.</p>
      <p>There are 650 constituencies, where voters are invited to select an MP to represent their area.</p>
      <p>Nearly three-and-a-half years ago voters were called to the ballot box to decide whether the UK should remain in or leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>The majority chose to leave and we were supposed to have left on March, 29 this year, however, it has since been delayed after MPs failed to back plans put forward by former Prime Minister Theresa May and now Boris Johnson.</p>
