      <p>Police in east China’s Zhejiang Province have apprehended 98 suspects for running online gambling involving a total of 290 million yuan (41.3 million U.S. dollars).</p>
      <p>In 2018, police in the city of Zhoushan cracked down on several cases in which suspects organised gambling in group chats on social media platforms through a mahjong app.</p>
      <p>After investigation, police found that Zhoushan had 220,000 registered users of the app by early 2018, with daily active users exceeding 20,000.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the app was developed by a tech company in Shanghai, which had developed more than 30 kinds of gambling apps involving over 20 provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Shanxi, and Hebei.</p>
      <p>The police received a tip off in June that partners of the company would meet in Shanghai on June 18.</p>
      <p>Zhoushan police then cooperated with their counterparts in Shanghai and busted the gang.</p>
      <p>The police said 46 of the suspects had been transferred for prosecution so far.</p>
