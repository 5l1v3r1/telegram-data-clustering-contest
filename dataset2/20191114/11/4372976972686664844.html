      <h2>Ensuring self-driving cars are safe in crowded urban areas is a bigger challenge than engineers had assumed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:53:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>FRANKFURT â€” Daimler has taken a "reality check" on self-driving "robotaxis", acknowledging that making them safe is proving harder than first thought amid questions over their future earnings potential.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius told journalists on Thursday</p>
      <p>Daimler would "rightsize" its spending level on robotaxis and that self-driving technology would more likely be applied to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/commercial-trucks/">commercial vehicles</a> for freight companies on long haul routes.</p>
      <p>Carmakers raced to develop self-driving vehicles after Google presented a prototype car in 2012, leading Daimler to develop an autonomous <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/mercedes_benz/">Mercedes</a>.</p>
      <p>The idea of fleets of robotaxis picking up and ferrying customers around cities gained traction, driven by the stellar growth of ride services such as <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/uber/">Uber</a> and of delivery services firms.</p>
      <p>However, costs and regulatory hurdles have spiraled, leading to a reassessment of the business potential.</p>
      <p>"There has been a reality check setting in here," Kaellenius said.</p>
      <p>Ensuring that self-driving cars are 100% safe in crowded urban areas is proving to be a bigger challenge than engineers had assumed a few years ago, he said.</p>
      <p>Even if Daimler is able to make robotaxis safe, the benefits of entering the crowded ride-hailing business with self-driving cars remain unclear, he added.</p>
      <p>"The full scale deployment would tie up a lot of capital with some uncertainties around the earnings potential," he said.</p>
      <p>"At this juncture we said to be the first one, does not make sense."</p>
      <p>Daimler has already sought a development alliance with <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/">BMW</a> for semi-autonomous vehicle technology and it has another project with supplier Robert Bosch to perfect technology for fully <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/driverless+car/">driverless cars</a>.</p>
