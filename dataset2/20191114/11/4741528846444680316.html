      <h1>This NNPC initiative aims to solve the problem of tanker explosions  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:20:10+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/emmanuel-abara/" target="_blank">Emmanuel Abara Benson</a></address>
      <p>The management of the <b>Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation</b> (NNPC) said there is a new initiative in place which is aimed at preventing future incidents of petrol tanker accidents. Yesterday, the Group Managing Director of the state-owned oil company, Mele Kyari, gathered stakeholders in Abuja to unveil the new initiative which is called the Safe-To-Load-Programme.</p>
      <p><b>A brief statement made available</b> by the NNPC disclosed that the initiative is a brainchild of Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Mr Mustapha was represented at the event by Ademola Ali, a staff of the SGF Office.</p>
      <p>Other stakeholders, who attended the meeting, include key officials from the Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), staff from the Federal Ministry of Works/Housing &amp; Transport, officials of the Nigeria Police Force and the Federal Road Safety Corporation, among others.</p>

      <p><b>While addressing the stakeholders</b>, the NNPC GMD stressed that it had become imperative to proffer a lasting solution to the incessant incidents of petrol tanker explosions across the country. He also claimed that safety is a core value of the NNPC, which is why this measure is being adopted in order to address the problem at hand.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Speaking further</b>, he disclosed that the Safe-To-Load-Programme basically entails the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>digitisation of all analogue loading facilities;</li>
        <li>ensuring that every truck departing NNPC’s depots meets the required axle limits;</li>
        <li>weight-bridges and sprinklers will be installed in every loading gantry; and</li>
        <li>the NNPC is also working to fix its pipelines in order to facilitate movement of petroleum products without excessive reliance on road transportation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Recall that in 2019 alone</b>, there have been many reported incidents of petrol tanker explosions in the country. This is mainly because Nigeria transports its refined petroleum products by its mostly deplorable roads.</p>
      <p><b>Last month</b>, Nairametrics reported how fire gutted some parts of <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/10/17/onitsha-fire/">the popular Upper Iweka and <b>Ochanja Market</b> in Onitsha</a>, Anambra State after a tanker loaded with petrol fell and exploded. Some deaths were reported, even as many shops with very valuable goods were razed down in the inferno.</p>
      <p><b>In June 2018</b>, Nigerians were outraged after a petrol tanker fell and exploded on Otedola Bridge in Lagos.</p>
