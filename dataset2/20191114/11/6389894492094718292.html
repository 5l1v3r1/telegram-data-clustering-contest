      <p>The iconic flip phone has made a comeback, with Motorola revealing an upgraded version of the once-universal device.</p>
      <p>Some 15 years after the original Razr hit the markets, Motorola is launching a slim retro reboot with a foldable screen.</p>

      <p>The gadget, which is set to go on sale for $1,500 in the US on Boxing Day, will be rolled out across the world, including in the UK.</p>
      <p>Boasting a 6.2in foldable screen and a fingerprint sensor, the latest model is a major upgrade from the popular flip phones of the early noughties.</p>
      <p>When the phone is folded, there is a 2.7-inch glass-covered display which allows users to text, call and control music.</p>

      <p>The device has a thickness of 14mm when it is shut.</p>
      <p>“With the new Razr we had to rethink how to engineer a phone,” said Glenn Schultz, the firm’s head of product development.</p>
      <p>“Our zero-gap hinge allowed us to bring to market a device that folds completely in half. Many didn’t believe we could do it, but let me tell you, it’s fun to work on something that everyone thinks is impossible.”</p>

      <p>The original flip phones caused ripples in the mobile market in the 2000s, with the likes of Paris Hilton and David Beckham promoting the Razr device. <br/><br/>Motorola’s market share – which has suffered in the wake of the Iphone’s rise – has tumbled from more than 20 per cent to roughly two per cent in the last 15 years.</p>
