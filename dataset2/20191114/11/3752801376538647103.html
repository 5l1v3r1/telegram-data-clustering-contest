      <h1>Job ad offering 'free' fishing holiday to woman who will 'cook and clean' was a 'massive prank'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:10:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">Riaan Grobler</a></address>
      <p>A Clanwilliam man has been inundated with calls from hopefuls after a friend placed a fake newspaper ad offering a "free" fishing holiday in Henties Bay in Namibia in exchange for cooking and cleaning.  </p>
      <p>The advertisement, which appeared in Die Burger on Wednesday, reads: "Lady wanted to cook and clean for five men during a fishing holiday in Henties Bay. In exchange, the chosen candidate can enjoy a free holiday that includes accommodation, food and transport."</p>
      <p>It then lists a number for JP van Zyl, stating that applications close on Friday. </p>
      <p>The ad had gone viral by Thursday, with many on social media expressing disbelief and outrage at the "job offer".</p>
      <p>"Are there actually people who would advertise such shit? My faith in the human race is ruined," Charl Stevens posted on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"Holiday? What #$@% holiday? She has to be a slave to 5 guys! The tragedy is: there are many women who would do it!" said Agatha Ikking.</p>
      <p>"Don't miss the change of a holiday of a lifetime!" Anton Zeelie noted sarcastically.</p>
      <p>"Wonderful opportunity - I should update my CV," Paulina Engelbrecht posted. </p>
      <p>But it turns out the advertisement was just a massive practical joke by one of his friends, Van Zyl told News on Thursday. </p>
      <p>"You have no idea how much response I have received," a laughing Van Zyl said. "But it was only a joke... One of my friends thought it would be really funny to prank me like this."</p>
      <p>According to Van Zyl, the fishing trip to Henties Bay is indeed being planned, "but that is the only part that is true [in the ad]." </p>
      <p>
        <b>Inundated with calls</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I know the guy who placed the ad very well, he is a good friend of mine. It gave us a good laugh." </p>
      <p>Van Zyl says he has since been inundated with calls from potential takers. </p>

      <p>"You will not believe how many women responded to the ad, saying they were willing to go. The calls, SMSes, WhatsApps - it just doesn't stop! It's actually scary that they are willing to do it. </p>
      <p>"Many of the women who responded are even married. And there have even been quite a number of guys who also want to go on holiday with us. They tell me they can also cook - they want to come along...</p>
      <p>"But it was a joke - I am not entirely crazy," Van Zyl said. </p>
      <p>"Everybody wants to find me a wife," he quips. "Maybe there's a happy ending here - you never know.</p>
      <p>"At least people can have a laugh about it. There are so many negative stories in the news. If people want to laugh at my expense, I have no problem with that..."</p>
