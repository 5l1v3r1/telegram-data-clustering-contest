      <p>Delhi High Court has issued notice to the central government to file an affidavit within one week stating names and addresses of all the ex-MLAs, ex-MPs, and other government officials who have been occupying government bungalows in an unauthorised manner.</p>
      <p>The Division Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Hari Shankar also asked the government to mention the amount that needs to be recovered from the officials who have been overstaying in government bungalows in an unauthorised manner.</p>
      <p>A PIL filed by Anti Corruption Council of India, has made the following demands before the court:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Direct government to give details of Ex-MLAs, Ex-MPs, and other persons who are involved in illegal occupying and overstaying in the government residential premises</li>
        <li>Direct government to show detailed expenditure on the current residential facilities of MPs, who have been staying outside due to non-availability of government bungalows and flats</li>
      </ol>
      <p>During the proceedings, it was submitted by the Petitioner that over 100 government bungalows are being occupied by ex-officers who are not authorised to occupy such premises due to exhaustion of their government service.</p>
      <p>It was also argued by the Petitioner that due to such unauthorised stay, many MPs and MLAs are being given accommodation in 5-star hotels at the expense of taxpayer's money.</p>
      <p>The court was also informed of the fact that an RTI was filed by the Petitioner seeking the above-mentioned information from the government, but the same was not answered by the concerned department.</p>
      <p>While issuing the notice, the Bench also asked the government to take this matter seriously. Moreover, it is also ordered that if the said affidavit is not filed within one week, the Secretary will have to make a personal appearance before the court.</p>
      <p>The Petitioner in this matter was represented by Advocates <b>ZU Khan</b>, <b>KK Shukla</b>, <b>Hussain Mueen Farooq</b> and <b>Ajeet Kumar Sharma</b></p>
