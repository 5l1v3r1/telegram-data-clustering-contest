        <b>A west midlands trust is set to lose roughly 20 per cent of its income after deciding not to renew a mental health contract, as two providers reshape around the patches of their integrated care systems.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gloucestershire Health and Care Foundation Trust, which predicts <a href="https://ghc.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/Trust-Board-25th-July-2019-Public.pdf">a total annual income of £117m</a> this financial year, recently told Herefordshire Clinical Commissioning Group it would not provide its mental health and learning disability services beyond 31 March 2020.</p>
      <p>Commissioners instead plan to directly award a two-year £49.9m contract to Worcestershire Health and Care Trust.</p>
      <p>The Gloucestershire trust and its predecessor have provided mental health and learning disability services for Herefordshire CCG since 2011. In 2019-20, this contract was valued at £23.2m.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://herefordshireccg.nhs.uk/library/governing-body-papers/governing-body-papers-2019/22-october-2019-extraordinary-meeting/2793-item-04-gb-contract-decisions-gb-october-2019/file">procurement notice</a> regarding the move said providing Herefordshire’s mental health services did not align with the trust’s “core functions”.</p>
      <p>However, at a recent meeting, commissioners said the move instead aligns with the development of the area’s NHS structures. </p>
      <p>Herefordshire and Worcestershire sustainability and transformation partnership plans to become an integrated care system, while the Gloucestershire trust, which was formed with last month’s merger of 2gether Foundation and Gloucestershire Care Services Trust, is part of the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/integrated-care-systems/gloucestershire-ics/">One Gloucestershire integrated care system</a> and provides mental health services for Gloucestershire CCG.</p>
      <p>The procurement notice continued: “There are currently two different commissioning arrangements and service models for mental health and learning disabilities health services across Herefordshire and Worcestershire.</p>
      <p>“Having different models of provision contributes to inequalities and inefficiencies in the provision of community and acute care — exacerbating the gaps in provision for patients in Herefordshire”</p>
      <p>Herefordshire CCG, Gloucestershire Health and Care Trust and Worcestershire Health and Care Trust declined to comment for this story, citing pre-election restrictions.</p>
      <p>The CCG itself is <a href="https://www.herefordshireccg.nhs.uk/news-events/354-four-herefordshire-and-worcestershire-ccgs-to-merge-in-april-2020">set to merge</a> with three other commissioning groups on next April. The merger is in line with the NHS long-term plan, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/policy-and-regulation/all-of-england-to-become-ics-by-2021/7024122.article">which calls for one CCG per STP</a>.</p>
      <p>NHS England and Improvement has <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/integration/batch-of-ccg-mergers-approved-for-next-year/7026156.article">given the green light</a> to numerous large-scale commissioning mergers across the country. It is hoped the combined groups will operate more efficiently. Last year, CCGs were asked to <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/policy-and-regulation/ccg-admin-budgets-to-be-cut-by-a-fifth/7023898.article">slash their running costs</a> by 20 per cent.</p>
