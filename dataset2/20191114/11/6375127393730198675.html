      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:46:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/itchie-g-cabayan" target="_blank">Itchie G. Cabayan</a></address>
      <h3>‘I DON’T want demoralization. Employees who have served longer and are qualified will be prioritized in terms of promotion.’</h3>
      <p>This assurance was made by Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, as he stressed that he does not want demoralization prevailing among the ranks of city employees.</p>
      <p>Speaking before employees, Moreno also urged those who have been serving for the longest time to take the opportunity to apply for promotion and take the civil service examinations, which will pave the way for their better chances at promotion.</p>
      <p>‘Ayoko ng demoralization. Mas matagal, mas dapat ma-promote. Kung hindi qualified, eh di ‘yung susunod na mas matagal. Kung di pa rin ulit qualified, ‘yung susunod ulit na mas matagal na sa trabaho,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Moreno assured that the basis for promotion will be the length of service and qualification and not the closeness to the boss.</p>
      <p>‘Hindi porke’t taga-bitbit ng bag or kasa-kasamang namamasyal diyan sa SM  ‘yun ang ipo-promote kahit hindi kwalipikado,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Moreno added that it also does not matter if the employee concerned campaigned for or is associated with his political rivals, as long as they are qualified for the position they are applying for.</p>
      <p>‘Marami na nga akong napirmahan na appointment ni hindi ko kilala o nakita eh.  Di naman importante na makita ko pa.  Ang importante eh tumutupad sa tungkulin,’ he said.</p>
