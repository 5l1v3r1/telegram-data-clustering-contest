      <h1>Investors Raise Billions To Invest In Later-Stage Companies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:47:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Later-stage tech startups are getting cash infusions from big investors eager to make deals, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35df8336-05a4-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">The Financial Times</a> (FT) reported on Wednesday (Nov. 13).</p>
      <p>SoftBank’s record losses from over-valued deals haven’t given investors cold feet, and private funding is going strong. Investors from the U.S. are on course to break fundraising records, with $23.9 billion already earmarked for growth equity funds, the FT said, citing Pitchbook data.</p>
      <p>Cambridge Associates managing director Michael Larsen said investment groups have triggered a “massive convergence” for late-stage startups.</p>
      <p>“More of the prime growth happens in the private years,” Larsen told FT. “Companies are also taking a longer path and achieving more scale.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.blackstone.com/the-firm/our-people/person?person=1000272">Blackstone</a> founder and chief executive officer Stephen Schwarzman is planning to raise $3 to $4 billion for its first growth equity fund led by former General Atlantic executive Jon Korngold, sources told FT.</p>
      <p>Hedge fund <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Management">Tiger Global Management</a> is on the prowl to raise $3.75 billion for a January investment fund, according to a document seen by FT.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley’s <a href="https://lsvp.com/">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a> is looking to raise funds for startups close to initial public offerings (IPO), sources told FT.</p>
      <p>Japan’s SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said Vision Fund 2 is tracking to raise $108 billion despite the WeWork debacle, Uber losses and questions about the participation of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth funds. </p>
      <p>“It’s a longer trend, but SoftBank definitely threw fuel on the fire,” said Bob Blee, head of the corporate finance group at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=silicon+valley+bank&amp;oq=Silicon+Valley+Bank&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.230j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Silicon Valley Bank</a>. Venture capital firms are trying to compete with larger funds, he said.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley Bank research indicated that there has been a record number of funding rounds that exceeded $100 million in the 12 months ending September.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2019/fundbox-tipalti-tip-venture-capital-scales/">B2B venture capital</a> for payments innovators has given way to an impressive start to the fall season with more than $420 million in funding. In September, Fundbox and Tipalti were among the many startups getting massive deals.</p>
