      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/beck-interview-new-album-hyperspace-producer-pharrell-2558020">Speaking about his collaboration with Pharrell to <i>NME</i>, Beck said:</a> “I’d always wanted to make a record with him. We had been friendly over the years and had got together and talked about making some music back in 2012, but around that time he ended up putting out a song with Daft Punk, then ‘Blurred Lines’ and ‘Happy’.”</p>
      <p>They started collaborating when Pharrell asked Beck to work on the new <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/nerd">N.E.R.D</a>. record. “From there we started sharing songs and writing and doing this project together,” Beck explained.</p>
      <p>“I had a few things after the ‘Colors’ tour finished and I really wanted to seize the moment with this project,” Beck added. “There’d been a period of time where Pharrell had been really busy and an opportunity opened up so I went with it. Originally it was going to be a single or an EP, but I think we were both surprised when there was a body of work here.”</p>
      <p>The upcoming album will also feature <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/coldplay">Coldplay</a>’s Chris Martin on ‘Stratosphere’ and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/sky-ferreira">Sky Ferreira </a>on ‘Die Waiting’.</p>
      <p>Back in October, Martin joined Beck onstage for a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-coldplay-frontman-chris-martin-join-beck-for-loser-performance-2557038">rendition of his 1994 cult hit, ‘Loser’.</a></p>
