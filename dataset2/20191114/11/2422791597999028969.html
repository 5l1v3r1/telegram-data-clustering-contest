      <p>PARIS -- Women who say they were raped and sexually assaulted in France by an associate of Jeffrey Epstein are voicing frustration at the apparent glacial progress of a French police probe into their allegations.</p>
      <p>The women question the zeal of investigators. French police have made only one public appeal for potential witnesses to come forward and it was only in French.</p>
      <p>Former model Thysia Huisman told The Associated Press: "I'm disappointed."</p>
      <p>Huisman is among a dozen people who have given evidence for the French probe. She told police she was drugged and raped in 1991 at age 18 by Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modelling agent who is central to the French investigation. Brunel denies wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Epstein maintained a residence in Paris before he took his life in August while awaiting trial on U.S. sex trafficking charges.</p>
