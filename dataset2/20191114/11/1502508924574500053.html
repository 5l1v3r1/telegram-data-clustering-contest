      <p>Alleging that the central government was not providing the funds which were due to the state, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said those amount would have helped the state carry out relief work in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">Cyclone </a>'Bulbul'-hit areas. Banerjee expressed hope that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would keep his promise of helping the state in dealing with the relief work in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>affected areas.</p>
      <p>"Around Rs 17,000 crore is due to us from the Centre. If they had given us that due amount, we could have used that to carry out relief works," Banerjee told reporters at the state secretariat on Thursday.</p>
