      <p>Moody's Investors Service today slashed <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAfeBW"><b>India's economic growth forecast</b></a> to 5.6 per cent for 2019, saying government measures do not address the widespread weakness in consumption demand.</p>
      <p>"We have revised down our growth forecast for India. We now forecast slower real GDP growth of 5.6 per cent in 2019, from 7.4 per cent in 2018," it said. "India's economic slowdown is lasting longer than previously expected." Moody's had on October 10 slashed India's economic growth forecast for 2019-20 fiscal to 5.8 per cent from an earlier estimate of 6.2 per cent.</p>
