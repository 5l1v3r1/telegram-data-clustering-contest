      <p>Funimation and Toei Animation are teaming up to celebrate 30 years of <b><i>Dragon Ball Z</i></b> in a big way in 2020. They will be launching the <b><i>Dragon Ball</i></b> Symphonic Adventure, which will be produced by Overlook Events and presented by AWR Music Productions. The event will take scenes from the show and combine them with a 60-piece orchestra and live vocals to create “an immersive multimedia event for fans.” This sounds like a great way to celebrate 30 years of one of the most popular anime. The North American tour for the <i>Dragon Ball</i> Symphonic Adventure will start on March 27, 2020, in Chicago. The event will be held at the Rosemont Theatre with music by the World Festival Symphony Orchestra who will be conducted by <b>Eric Roth</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>Based on its Narrative Symphonic Experience concept, Overlook Events mixes a symphony orchestra with rock instruments, live vocals, sound effects and light synchronized to a compilation of Dragon Ball video excerpts projected on giant screens, following a strict narrative – to create the “Dragon Ball Symphonic Adventure.” The result is a concert experience that achieves a musical and technical mastery still very rare in an industry dominated by cinema-concerts.</blockquote>
