        <b>Crypto.com, a digital currency-based platform from Hong Kong, has recently announced the launch of its beta crypto exchange, with plans to make it one of the top 10 exchanges within 5 years.</b>

      <h3>Crypto.com to launch a new exchange</h3>
      <p>According to Crypto.com, the purpose of the exchange — apart from providing a platform where users can buy and sell coins — is to help drive the mass adoption of the emerging asset class. The firm’s CEO and co-founder, Kris Marszalek, stated that the exchange is a ‘natural extension’ of Crypto.com’s business, which will ensure that everything remains in its own ecosystem.</p>

      <p>crypto.com announce new beta launch of exchange</p>
      <p>The company also highlighted some of the most important features of the upcoming exchange, such as increased liquidity, institutional-grade security and custody, low trading fees, and user-friendly interface.</p>
      <p>Crypto.com has managed to achieve a lot in the time since the company’s founding. It currently boasts over one million users, and it is one of the first crypto firms to obtain requirements necessary for the <a href="https://www.rsisecurity.com/compliance-advisory-services/ccss/">Cryptocurrency Security Standard</a>. The platform also has an impressive security reputation and has never suffered a hacking incident, according to Marszalek. These factors promise a high success rate for the upcoming exchange.</p>
      <p>Marszalek revealed that the exchange will support 9 cryptocurrencies immediately after launch, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, USDT, EOS, Stellar, and MCO.</p>
      <h3>CRO Token Will Fuel the New Platform</h3>
      <p>The new platform will utilize Crypto.com’s native cryptocurrency, Crypto.com Coin (CRO), to provide a number of benefits to users, such as a fee discount, better execution prices, and increased liquidity.</p>
      <p>The token has reacted positively to the announcement of Crypto.com’s new beta exchange launch, surging by around 16.01%. Its price at the time of writing sits at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crypto-com-coin/">$0.0450516</a>, while its market cap has increased to $471.58 million.</p>
      <p>The launch of Crypto.com’s exchange comes as a bit of a surprise, considering that Marszalek himself stated that he had doubts about launching an exchange. With the number of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-5-countries-for-crypto-exchanges/">crypto exchanges in the world</a> already being quite high, there is definitely no lack of such services in the space. However, he has changed his opinion recently, stating that he now sees the exchange as a necessity in order for Crypto.com to grow further.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but he believes that the exchange will indeed thrive, thanks to the firm’s large user base and the fact that it already meets all regulatory requirements.</p>
