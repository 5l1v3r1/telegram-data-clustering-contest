      <h1>Konami just re-upped gaming trademarks for the Goemon series, should we get our hopes up?</h1>
      <h2>I mean, I'll hold out</h2>

      <p><i>Goemon</i> is just one of those series that means different things to different people. For some, the SNES entry <i>Legend of the Mystical Ninja</i> was their first foray into this magical, crazy series. For many others, it was <i>Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</i> on the N64.</p>
      <p>But one thing is for sure, after all these years people still hold water for the franchise and want to see its glorious return. There's just one problem: Konami still controls it. The last time <i>Goemon</i> was truly active was in 2005 on the DS, as well as...wait for it...2011 when Konami made a sequel to the original pachislot game in Japan.</p>
      <p>That could change. According to Japanese Nintendo, Konami has opted for new trademarks for <i>Goemon</i>Â that include "game software" and "game programs." It's a multi-faceted claim that could lead to nothing more than Virtual Console/retro re-releases (which are now Switch Online NES/SNES perks). Either way, it's hope.</p>
