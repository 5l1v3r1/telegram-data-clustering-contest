        <figcaption>Amazing footage shows a huge murmuration of starlings in the skies above North Devon</figcaption>

      <p>This incredible video shows one of nature's greatest spectacles in the skies over Devon.</p>
      <p>Thousands and thousands of starlings created this stunning murmuration just off one of the counties busiest roads.</p>
      <p>The footage was taken by North Devon wildlife photographer Jason Barrow.</p>
      <p>Jason had been driving home on Tuesday night when he noticed the incredible sight and pulled over to capture it.</p>

      <p>It happened just over a field by the side of the busy A39 road between Kilkhampton and Hartland.</p>
      <p>He said: "They were everywhere, it was just great to see so many."</p>
      <h3>What are they?</h3>

      <p>According to the RSPB, starling murmurations are basically a mass aerial stunt - thousands of birds all swooping and diving in unison.</p>
      <p>We think that starlings do it for many reasons. Grouping together offers safety in numbers – predators such as peregrine falcons find it hard to target one bird in the middle of a hypnotising flock of thousands.</p>
      <p>They also gather to keep warm at night and to exchange information, such as good feeding areas. </p>
      <p>They gather over their roosting site, and perform their wheeling stunts before they roost for the night.</p>
      <h3>Where can you see them?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Autumn roosts usually begin to form in November, though this varies from site to site and some can begin as early as September. </p>
      <p>More and more birds will flock together as the weeks go on, and the number of starlings in a roost can swell to around 100,000 in some places. </p>
      <p>Early evening, just before dusk, is the best time to see them across the UK. You don't need any special equipment as it's all visible by just looking to the skies.</p>
      <p>They mainly choose to roost in places which are sheltered from harsh weather and predators, such as woodlands, but reedbeds, cliffs, buildings and industrial structures are also used.</p>
      <p>During the day however, they form daytime roosts at exposed places such as treetops, where the birds have good all-round visibility.</p>
      <h3>Declining numbers</h3>

      <p>The starling population has fallen by more than 80 per cent in recent years, meaning they are now on the critical list of UK birds most at risk.</p>
      <p>The decline is believed to be due to the loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farm chemicals and a shortage of food and nesting sites in many parts of the UK.</p>
