      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd today slammed the Ministry of Health (MoH) for carrying out selective prosecution of a legitimate tobacco company selling legal non-cigarette products while turning a blind eye to cheap illegal contraband.</p>
      <p>This comes as the MoH overturned its approval granted on July 12, 2018 for BAT to sell its "mini-cigar" — the Dunhill HTL-Cigarillo — as a non-cigarette tobacco product.</p>
      <p>In a letter dated Oct 21, 2019 sent to BAT's wholly-owned subsidiary Commercial Marketers and Distributors Sdn Bhd (CMD), the Ministry said that upon analysis of the Cigarillo, MoH found that the Cigarillo falls within the definition of a cigarette under the Control of Tobacco Product Regulations 2004 and that it will be required to comply with the restrictions applicable to cigarettes under the regulation.</p>
      <p>"We are especially baffled by the fact that there are other legal cigarillo products in the market today, but these products were not a part of any enforcement actions. Only DUNHILL HTL-Cigarillos were the focus of these raids. This also shows an inconsistency in the way MoH applies their policy," said BAT Malaysia managing director Erik Stoel in a statement today.</p>
      <p>Stoel criticised the Deputy Director General (Public Health) of the Health Ministry Datuk Dr Chong Chee Kheong for his unexpected 'U-turn' decision, claiming it highlights the challenging and unreasonable parameters imposed on a legal tobacco company to operate in this country.</p>
      <p>"This product was approved as a non-cigarette not only by MoH for sale a year ago but also by the Royal Malaysian Customs. Revoking it unilaterally without any chance of consultation is against any reasonable expectation of a legal business, let alone a public-listed company like us," he said.</p>
      <p>As such, CMD has today filed an application for a judicial review on the decisions made by the MoH to recategorise DUNHILL HTL-Cigarillo as a cigarette and to revoke its approval for sale as a non-cigarette tobacco product.</p>
      <p>In the application, CMD sought the following reliefs:</p>
      <p>&gt; that CMD be granted leave to apply for an order to quash the MoH decisions;</p>
      <p>&gt; for declarations that the MoH decisions are null and void; and</p>
      <p>&gt; for damages to be assessed in respect of all loss and injury sustained by CMD by reason of and/or incidental to and/or arising from the MoH Decisions in relation to the Cigarillo.</p>
      <p>Stoel accused the Ministry of intentionally coordinating a raid in East Malaysia affecting over 100 retailers weeks before a revocation letter was issued to the company. This, he said, deprived the company any chance to comply with the MoH revocation letter.</p>
      <p>The revocation letter allows the company a period of one month to remove the product from the market.</p>
      <p>"The heavy-handed approach we have endured is reflective of MoH’s subjective interpretation of the law without consultation of legal tobacco players.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Stoel highlighted that 65% of the cigarettes consumed in the country are cheap illegal contraband. As such, he lambasted Chong for focusing on the wrong issue.</p>
      <p>"The Deputy DG of Health and the Tobacco Control Sector has clearly lost the plot. The reality is that the Ministry’s own ineffective policy-making has undermined its own health agenda. Smoking consumption has grown by 5% and according to MoH data incidences of youth smoking have increased to 13.8% on the back of easily available illicit tobacco. Should that not be a priority of the Ministry?" he asked.</p>
      <p>Under the regulation, a cigarette is defined as “any product which consists wholly or partly of cut, shredded or manufactured tobacco, or of any tobacco derivative or substitute, rolled up in a single or more wrapper of paper, and which is capable of being immediately used for smoking”.</p>
      <p>Dunhill HTL-Cigarillos are cigarillos which are best described as a "mini-cigar", according to BAT. Unlike a cigarette which is wrapped in paper, a cigarillo is wrapped in tobacco leaves or tobacco based material comprising of homogenised tobacco more commonly known as reconstituted tobacco.</p>
