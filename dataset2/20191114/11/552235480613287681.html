      <h2>The pork sausages from Ballards made it to the final five of the champion of champions competition at the Butchers Shop of the Year Awards</h2>

      <p>A Castle Douglas butcher’s sausages are among the best in Britain.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Craig of Ballards on King Street recently returned home from the Butchers Shop of the Year Awards in London.</p>
      <p>And while the shop’s pork sausages didn’t win the overall champion of champions sausage title, they did make it to the final five.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jimmy said: “I didn’t know whether or not to go but I decided I would as I might never get the chance again. I’m glad I did.”</p>
      <p>The competition, held at the Hilton London Bankside, pitted award-winning sausages from across the UK and Ireland against each other.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">Ballards earned its place after the firm’s pork sausages were named best in Scotland by Scottish Craft Butchers earlier this year.</a>
