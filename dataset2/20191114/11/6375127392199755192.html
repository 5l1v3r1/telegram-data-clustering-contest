      <h3>A TOTAL ofÂ  312 Chinese nationals reportedly involved in telco fraud were deported by the Bureau of Immigration (BI).</h3>
      <p>Spokesperson Dana Sandoval said the 312 is part of the 512 arrested by the BI last month in a massive raid of a Business Processing Outsourcing office in Pasay City. Also leaving with the 312 are 21 minors whose custody were turned over to the Chinese embassy upon determination of their age.</p>
      <p>It can be recalled that last October 9, the BI conducted a raid in an office in the Millenium Building, Pasay City and hauled 512 aliens found to be reportedly conducting scamming operations. Those arrested consisted of Chinese, Burmese, Malaysians, Vietnamese, Taiwanese, and Indonesians.</p>
      <p>According to BI Intelligence chief Fortunato Manahan, Jr. the operation was a success after the implementation of the mass deportation and said they are thankful to the NCRPO (National Capital Region Police Office) for assisting the BI in the operation.</p>
