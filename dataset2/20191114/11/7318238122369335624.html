      <p>Maynard, who played for non-league Alphenese Boys but also made appearances at Royal Antwerp and Burton Albion FC, was shot dead in his car in Amsterdam-Zuidoost in September.</p>
      <p>It sparked a man hunt for two suspects who were believed to have fled the scene on a black scooter.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old defender had previously said it was his "dream" to play football in England. He had also played in Portugal and Hungary.</p>
      <p>In a statement at the time of his death, Burton Albion FC said it was "saddened" by the news, and added: "Our sympathies go out to all his family and friends at this difficult time."</p>
