      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): Gas Malaysia Bhd's third quarter net profit grew 12.24% to RM46.48 million, from RM41.42 million a year earlier, on higher revenue.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 increased to 3.27 sen, from 3.2 sen previously.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose 12.82% to RM1.76 billion from RM1.56 billion a year ago, thanks to higher volume of natural gas sold and higher natural gas tariff, Gas Malaysia said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2019, Gas Malaysia's net profit edged up 7.22% to RM138.8 million or 10.29 sen per share, from RM129.46 million or 10.07 sen per share last year, while revenue was up 15.87% to RM5.21 billion from RM4.49 billion.</p>
      <p>On prospects, Gas Malaysia expects the group's profitability for 2019 to be in tandem with the level reflecting the prevailing tariff setting mechanism framework.</p>
      <p>"The board anticipates that the yearly increase in natural gas sale volume and number of customers will sustain for the financial year 2019," the group added.</p>
      <p>Shares of Gas Malaysia closed one sen or 0.35% lower at RM2.82 today, valuing the group at RM3.62 billion.</p>
