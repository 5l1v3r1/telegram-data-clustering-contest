      <h1>Andrew Gutman to leave Celtic on loan again as defender agrees Stateside return</h1>
      <h2>The 23-year-old will spend the whole of 2019 away from Celtic.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:00:11+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic full back <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andrew-gutman">Andrew Gutman</a> will spend the whole of 2019 on loan at FC Cincinnati in the MLS.</p>
      <p>The defender signed a three-year deal at the Hoops last January but work permit issues meant he was immediately sent on loan to Charlotte Independence in the USL.</p>
      <p>He then joined Cincinnati in August and played eight times before the end of the season in October.</p>
      <p>And he'll now spend the whole of the 2019 MLS season - from March to November 2020 - on loan at the club from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> , who finished bottom of the league during their first campaign in the top flight.</p>
      <p>The club won just six games during their maiden league campaign and were beaten by USL side St Louis in the US Open Cup.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old left back is widely regarded as one of America's rising stars but is back in Glasgow training with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon's</a> men during the MLS off-season.</p>
      <p>And he admits it is an opportunity to remind Lennon of his capabilities.</p>
      <p>Gutman told fccincinnati.com: "It’s been good. It was a big step in my career, obviously.</p>
      <p>"I played in the USL and did well there, then went back (to Celtic) and did well in preseason there. Coming here was a good opportunity for me to get games at a high level, and I think I’ve done pretty well so far.”</p>
      <p>“They’re in season, but they have such a big squad, so the guys that aren’t rostered for games will have training sessions.</p>
      <p>"I’ll have a good stint of training over there with them just to get back in front of their faces and show them my qualities again.”</p>
      <p>Celtic also signed fellow American full back <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manny-perez">Manny Perez</a> last January, and he spent the season on loan at North Carolina FC.</p>
