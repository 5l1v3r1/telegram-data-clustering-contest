      <p>The word from <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-sonys-uncharted-adaptation-1203394336/">the Hollywood snoops at Variety</a> is that Mark Wahlberg has signed up for Sony's upcoming movie adaption of<i> Uncharted</i>, joining director Travis Knight and star Tom Holland in the new action flick, which recounts the adventures of a young Nathan Drake.<br/><br/>It is believed that the former Funky Bunch member - most recently seen in the <i>Transformers</i> series and hi-octane actioner<i> Mile 22</i> - will don the summery shirts of Victor "Sully" Sullivan, the carefree cad who takes Drake (Holland) under his wing and shows him the ins-and-outs of being an expert thief, adventurer, and artifact hunter.<br/><br/>Ironically, there was once a time where Wahlberg was in the running to play Nathan Drake himself, back when the concept of an<i> Uncharted</i> movie was first greenlit, but this particular project has gone through numerous changes - <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../sony-s-uncharted-movie-finds-new-director-in-travis-knight-568244.phtml">and directors</a> - since then. Still, it's great to see Wahlberg remain involved, even if in a new capacity.<br/><br/><i>Uncharted</i> begins production in 2020.<br/><br/><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-sonys-uncharted-adaptation-1203394336/">Mark Wahlberg joins Tom Holland in Uncharted movie</a> [Variety]</p>
