      <p>Neil Warnock has been backed to take the reins at Hearts and challenge Scottish giants Celtic and Rangers in the process.</p>
      <p>Veteran boss Warnock left his post with <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff City</a> on Monday after a lacklustre start to the Championship season.</p>
      <p>He was due to retire at the end of the 2019-20 campaign, but the 70-year-old previously revealed that he'd love to manage in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>He said over the summer: "I’ve always fancied one of them – Hibs and Hearts. It appeals to me up there with them being neighbours.</p>
      <p>"No disrespect to the big two but I’ve always been an underdog and I’ve always thought: 'I wish I could get a club up there and get a team to rival Celtic and Rangers.'</p>
      <p>"That’s how it used to be. Rangers haven’t been the force they were in recent years but I look back at what Aberdeen did all those years ago. It was unheard of, wasn’t it?</p>
      <p>"It would be nice to get something like that going. You’d have to do it on team spirit and togetherness and all that because the money isn’t there for Hearts and Hibs to compete with the two Glasgow clubs, really."</p>
      <p>Kirk Broadfoot, who played under Warnock at Rotherham and is now at Scottish side St Mirren, believes he would do a great job in the Scottish Premiership - and would relish the chance of shaking up the Glasgow monopoly.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neil-warnock-receives-hearts-backing-20877101">He said</a> : "He would be a great appointment for Hearts but great for Scottish football in general.</p>
      <p>"There would never be a dull moment if Neil was to come up here.</p>
      <p>"He is some character but more importantly he is a top manager, as he has proved throughout his career. If Neil was to go to Hearts then he would turn Tynecastle into a fortress and nobody would like going there.</p>
      <p>"It is a hard place to go just now but Neil would definitely take it up a notch or two.</p>
      <p>"He would unite everyone, the players and the fans, get everyone in it together.</p>
      <p>"That is one of his great strengths. He loves being the underdog and trying to beat the big teams so a job like Hearts would be perfect.</p>
      <p>"They have a good squad and have been unlucky with injuries but if they get the right manager in then I would expect them to climb quickly to the other end of the table."</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds are searching for Warnock's successor at Cardiff City Stadium, with ex-Millwall boss Neil Harris the current frontrunner.
