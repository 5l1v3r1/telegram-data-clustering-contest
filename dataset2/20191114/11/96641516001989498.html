      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/georgina-torbet" target="_blank">Georgina Torbet</a></address>
      <p>For competitive gamers, 3D audio can make the difference between locating a sneaking enemy and getting taken down by a well-aimed shot. Razer's gaming headsets have primarily used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/06/razer-launches-its-first-lightweight-kraken-headset/?_guc_consent_skip=1573728752">7.1 surround sound</a> for 3D audio in the past, but now the company is expanding its range of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/31/razer-thx-spatial-audio-headset-keyboard-mouse-gaming/?_guc_consent_skip=1573728847">competitive gaming headsets</a> using THX Spatial Audio with the launch of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZK6R8JF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=47939ba98d764296219958ef26c80dff&amp;language=en_US">Razer Kraken Ultimate</a>.</p>
      <p>THX Spatial Audio is a positioning audio feature that creates a 360-degree sound environment, and Razer promises it provides even greater positional accuracy than 7.1. The virtual speakers also match the distance of in-game audio sources which should put less strain on the ears.</p>
      <p>The audio is produced by 50mm drivers custom-tuned for a natural sound curve, and the microphone has active noise cancelling for clear communications with teammates.</p>
      <p>The headset also has comfort features integrated into the sound-isolating ear cushions, like cooling gel to prevent overheating during long gaming sessions and eyewear channels for those who wear regular or blue-light glasses. And of course, it wouldn't be a gaming product if there wasn't RGB, so it comes with RGB underglow which can be controlled through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/08/razer-chroma-alexa-support">Razer's Chroma software</a>.</p>
      <p>The headset weighs 275g and comes with a 1.3-meter-long cable that connects via USB, and it costs $129.99 or €149.99.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Kraken Ultimate, Razer is also introducing the more affordable Kraken X USB, which sells for $59.99 or €69.99. This headset has 7.1 surround sound, a bendable cardiod microphone, custom-tuned 40mm drivers and green earcup lighting.</p>
      <p>The Razer Kraken Ultimate and the Razer Kraken X USB are both available now from <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-audio/razer-kraken-ultimate">Razer's website</a> or from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZK6R8JF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=47939ba98d764296219958ef26c80dff&amp;language=en_US">Amazon</a>.</p>
