      <p>In mid-October, <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/samsung-android-10-galaxy-s10-heres-how-grab-now">Samsung opened up beta access</a> to Android 10 and its new One UI for Galaxy S10 owners, notice of which came by way of an official announcement. Now a month later, Samsung is doing the same for Galaxy Note 10+ owners, only without an official announcement (at least at the time of this writing).<br/><br/>This was first brought to attention by <i>XDA Developers</i> forum member tlbland0426. The user noticed <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/samsung">Samsung</a> had started accepting registrations for the Android 10 beta in the Samsung Members app, on unlocked <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review">Galaxy Note 10+</a> models in the US (SM-N975UI).<br/><br/>According to <i>SamMobile</i>, beta access is also available for regular Galaxy Note 10 owners (unlocked) in the US, not just the Galaxy Note 10+. To get it, here's what you need to do...</p>
      <h3>Installing The Android 10 Beta On Samsung Galaxy Note 10 And Galaxy Note 10+ Phones</h3>
      <p>The first order of business is to fire up the Samsung Members app on your Galaxy Note 10 or Galaxy Note 10+ handset. If you do not already have it, you can <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.voc">grab the app from Google Play</a></b>. Once you do that, you can register for the beta program.<br/><br/>After registering, the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/android-10">Android 10</a> beta should be available as an over-the-air update. Head over to <b>Settings &gt; Software update</b>. The initial beta is labeled as firmware version <b>N97*U1UEU2ZSK3</b>. The download should be in the neighborhood of 1.9GB.<br/><br/>It's still not clear when Samsung will start pushing out finalized Android 10 builds with its latest One UI to Galaxy Note 10 and <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review">Galaxy S10</a> owners at large. However, now that beta releases are starting to expand, we imagine final validation is not far behind (assuming these beta roll outs largely go without any hiccups).<br/><br/>One thing the updated software brings to the table is a tighter focus on what Samsung feels matters most to users, or at least that is the goal.<br/><br/>"The clean and easy-to-use interface allows users to enjoy minimized pop-ups, embedded loading indicators and simplified button arrangements. The new One UI features a streamlined design where notifications take up less space, so users are kept up-to-date while being able to focus on the task at hand. You stay focused while enjoying your favorite content in full screen and never miss any essential information," Samsung explained when announcing the beta release on Galaxy S10 devices.<br/><br/>There is also an enhanced dark mode, a tweaked smart lock screen that automatically adjusts the color and format of the clock and notifications so that the text and icons can be clearly seen, and various other changes.</p>
