      <h1>Double World Cup winner Frans Steyn sounds ready to put the farm before rugby</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:55:17+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/the-only-boks-player-to-beat-england-in-two-world-cup-finals-is-feeling-emotional-frans-steyn/">Two-time World Cup-winning Springbok Frans Steyn</a> appears set to call time on his European club adventure and exit <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier">Montpellier</a> at the end of January rather than what for his current contract to expire next July.</p>
      <p>Fresh from picking up his second World Cup winners medal in a final versus <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> twelve years after winning his first against the same opposition, the 32-year-old is ready to put his young family ahead of continuing his rugby career in Europe.</p>
      <p>Steyn is due back at Montpellier on November 19 following the Springboks champions tour of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> with the Webb Ellis Cup.</p>
      <p>It is believed he has already been in negotiation with Montpellier to prematurely end his deal as he reportedly wants to settle on the family farm in Bloemfontein and offer the same education to his children that he received.</p>
      <p><a href="http://ims.pressdisplay.as/epaper/en/viewer.aspx">Speaking to South African newspaper Volksblad</a>, Steyn explained: “Rugby has always been an inspiration for the Afrikaners, especially for farmers.

      <p>“Only good rain, a good rugby weekend gives us the power to face Mondays again. It is a privilege that many farmers do not have.</p>
      <p>“We know what to do in the future and what we need to have in place. We want to raise our children here and are attached to the rural feel that Bloemfontein offers. We want our children to have a good experience here as my wife and I had when one grew up here.”</p>

      <p>Attached to Montpellier since 2016, it apparently is not the first time that Steyn has mentioned retiring to the farm. However, this time it might just happen as it remains to be seen whether he would continue his rugby career locally with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/cheetahs">Cheetahs</a> in the PRO14 of the Free State <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/cheetahs">Cheetahs</a> in the Currie Cup.</p>
