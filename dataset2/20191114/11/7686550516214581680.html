      <p>Martin Lewis has revealed a handy trick that could see you get some free cash before Christmas. <br/><br/>Money can become a bit tight around this time of year, with many of us franticly looking to buy gifts for our friends and family. <br/><br/>This latest advice from <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts/">The Money Saving Expert blog</a> could help ease some of that financial pressure.</p>
      <p>To get this free £175, all you need to do is switch bank accounts. Currently, four banks will pay you to join them.</p>

      <p>"Switching only takes seven working days, and with most, you can get the bonus within a month of that," Martin says.</p>
      <p>"That's about 40 days, meaning it's still possible to bag the cash before 25 December, though even if you don't quite make that date, you'll have it to ease the Jan squeeze - when the gap between paydays is long."</p>
