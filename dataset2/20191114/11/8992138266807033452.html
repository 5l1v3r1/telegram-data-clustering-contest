      <h1>SIX Lists Tezos-Backed ETP, to Offer Staking Rewards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T11:46:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author">Arnab Shome</a></address>
      <p>Switzerland’s stock exchange <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/six/">SIX</a> added a Tezos-backed exchange-traded product (ETP) to its list of similar investment instruments.</p>
      <p>Similar to other such crypto products on the exchange, this was also developed by Amun AG in partnership with the Tezos Foundation.</p>
      <p>Given the proof-of-stake (PoS) structure of the digital currency, the ETP product will enable investors to generate passive income.</p>
      <p>The Tezos-backed ETP is listed under the ticker symbol of XTYZ at the stock exchange.</p>

      <p>Commenting on the new product, Hany Rashwan, chief executive of Amun, told ETF Stream: “Some staking services initially began as being secluded to a specific blockchain. As newer networks have popped up, many of these services have diversified and now offer staking services for numerous blockchains.”</p>
      <h3>Bringing crypto to the mainstream investors</h3>
      <p>It is the company’s<a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/six-lists-swiss-franc-denominated-crypto-etp/"> ninth such ETP product</a> listed on the Swiss exchange. Last month, it listed two such crypto-backed products on SIX – one <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/six-lists-a-bnb-backed-etp-product/">backed by Binance Coin</a> and another a crypto basket backed by Bitcoin and Ether.</p>
      <p>ETP is a publicly listed investment product that can be traded like any other stock. However, the companies managing them are legally obliged to back the products on a one-to-one basis by reserves of the underlying assets</p>
      <p>Amun has tied with Coinbase Custody to store all the digital assets backing its crypto products. Per the company, it is currently managing around $70 million worth digital asset-backed investment products.</p>
      <p>“For the first time, institutions, as well as retail investors, can invest in the public blockchain, the Tezos network with a PoS concept and consensus mechanism via our ETP and participate in the associated rewards for contributing to the security and stability of the Tezos blockchain – without the need to ever have to set up a crypto wallet or taking care of a private key,” Rashwan added.</p>
