      <p>The dramatic scenes came after the city was lashed by torrential rain and heavy winds.</p>
      <p>The recording was taken at around 1pm on Thursday on the A38 near a Premier Inn and McDonald’s.</p>

      <p>West Midlands Fire Service said: “When roads are wet, or covered in ice or snow, take extra care when driving. Stopping distances are much longer and your car might be more difficult to control.”</p>
