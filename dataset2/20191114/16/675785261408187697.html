      <h1>Kurt Zouma expresses admiration for Olivier Giroud's reaction to being benched</h1>
      <h2>The French forward has made just four appearances in the Premier League this season while Tammy Abraham has shone up front for the Blues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:21:03+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma has praised Olivier Giroud for continuing to remain professional despite his lack of minutes for the Blues so far this season.</p>
      <p>Manager Frank Lampard has tended to opt for either Tammy Abraham or Michy Batshuayi over the Frenchman, and Giroud has not played since Chelsea's 4-2 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> at the end of October.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Zouma insists Giroud still remains an influential figure in the dressing room, and lauded the striker for the effect he has had on some of the younger players.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.canalplus.com/">Canal+</a> Zouma said: "He is frustrated, he wants to play more. Like any football player, he wants to be on the pitch, but he is taking everything very calmly.</p>

      <p>"He is a professional, he works hard in training. I have a lot of respect for the player he is.</p>
      <p>"As someone in the dressing room, he is someone who gives advice to Tammy and Michy.</p>
      <p>"He wants the best for the team, which is important, and it is why he is a good person."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Giroud will stay at Stamford Bridge beyond January, and he is reportedly considering a move in order to gain playing time and ensure he remains in the reckoning for France's Euro 2020 squad.</p>
      <p>At the age of 33 Giroud is reaching the twilight of his career, and he may be considering the fact that Euro 2020 could well be his final tournament for France.</p>

      <p>He appeared for <i>Les Blues</i> in the most recent international break, scoring against both Iceland and Turkey, and was also included in the squad for France's final qualification fixtures against Moldova on Thursday and Albania on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , meanwhile, will look to continue their excellent recent form when they travel to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> after the international break on November 23.</p>
