      <h1>Shahid Kapoor on what makes Jersey different from ’83</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:17:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmfare.com/search/author_Filmfare" target="_blank">Filmfare</a></address>
      <p>There’s a lot of buzz around Shahid Kapoor’s much anticipated next – Jersey. The film is a remake of the Telugu sports drama with the same title and is slated for release on August 28, 2020. Jersey has got all Shahid fans super excited as he will be seen playing the role of a cricketer. What’s interesting is that next year Ranveer Singh starrer ’83 will also hit the screens which is again based on cricket. However, Shahid does believe that both films will have distinct identities.</p>
      <p>Opening up about the comparison between both the films, Shahid said in an interview, “ ’83 is a wonderful subject and I wish them all the best. It's about India triumphing at the World Cup and I think everybody wants to watch it. Jersey' is a personal film. It's a human journey and it touched me deeply. It's a very emotional film. I am guessing both films must have their own individual identity. I am definitely looking forward to seeing '83,”</p>

      <p>Busy prepping up for his role in the film, Shahid revealed that he is leaving no stone unturned to get his character right. He said, “I used to think I am a good cricketer because I used to open at school. I forgot the fact that there has been a long gap where I have not played cricket. It's fun to play cricket just like that, but when you are playing (the role of) a cricketer you need to get the technique right and dedicate a lot of time to it. I am trying to give as much time I can. I think we are in a time where authenticity is important. I don't think that as an actor you can get away without being convincing about playing a sportsperson. I am trying to get as close as I can. I am padded up, I am practising every day with season ball, with all the gears.”</p>
      <p>The Hindi version of Jersey will be helmed by Gowtam Tinnanauri, who also directed the original film.</p>
