      <h1>Public input needed for Waterloo cannabis shop</h1>
      <h2>You have until November 21 to have your say on a proposed retail cannabis shop in Waterloo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pare</a></address>
      <p>The first of three proposed cannabis shops in Waterloo Region has reached the next steps to becoming reality.</p>
      <p>The public input phase is open for the location at 32 King Street South in Waterloo, with submissions to be accepted until November 21 at midnight.</p>
      <p>This was the licensee that originally wanted to open in downtown Kitchener, but switched to the Waterloo location last month.</p>
      <p>According to the AGCO website, the Waterloo location would be called "Bud and Sally Cannabis Co."</p>
      <p>Once the public input period is over, the storefront would need an inspection by the AGCO before an opening date could be approved.</p>
      <p>The other two proposed stores in the region --- at 589 Fairway Road South in Kitchener and 75 Pinebush Road in Cambridge --- are still waiting to get to the next stage.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.iagco.agco.ca/prod/pub/en/Default.aspx?PossePresentation=PublicNoticeSearch">CLICK HERE</a> for the submission form on the AGCO website, and put "2208292" on the Applicant section for this storefront.</p>
