      <h2>Arsenal's second-choice goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez quickly removed his "like" on a post which called for Unai Emery's sacking as manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:30:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has come under fire after appearing to "like" an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post calling for Unai Emery to be sacked.</p>
      <p>Back-up keeper Martinez, 27, is currently away from north London on international duty with Argentina.</p>
      <p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted that Martinez had reacted to a post from "afc.talk" which stated "Like for Emery out", joining nearly 13,000 other users to like the picture.</p>
      <p>Martinez has since unliked the picture after fans spotted the activity, suggesting it may have been unintentional, but after a number of similar controversies not all fans are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

      <p>Commented on the incident on Reddit, one fan said: "I'm no longer willing to give the benefit of the doubt to any player who does this, even if it's our own. It's clearly on purpose."</p>
      <p>Another added: "A bit embarrassing if he's done that on purpose tbf. Be professional" and said "I wish players wouldn't do this s***, it's unprofessional as f*** and just furthers the media circus around the club."</p>
      <p>It was also labelled "confirmation" that "Unai Emery has lost the dressing room" whilst others praised Martinez and said "this guy has some balls!"</p>
      <p>The incident comes after striker Alexandre Lacazette was also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/alexandre-lacazette-likes-instagram-post-20739663">guilty of liking a post calling for Emery's sacking after they drew 2-2 with Crystal Palace.</a></p>

      <p>Martinez has been out on loan several times in recent years, including a spell at Reading last season, but has returned to the fold under Emery this season.</p>
      <p>Whilst he has played second fiddle to Bernd Leno in the Premier League, he has featured regularly in other competitions, starting all four Europa League games, keeping two clean sheets and conceding three goals.</p>
      <p>He also started both Carabao Cup games, including their 5-5 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , leading to a defeat on penalties.</p>
