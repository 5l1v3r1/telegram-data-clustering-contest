      <p>COLOMBO: Armed men stabbed and injured a writer in Sri Lanka on Thursday (Nov 14), a week after he published a book criticising the main opposition candidate at Saturday's presidential polls, police said.</p>
      <p>The attackers stormed the home of Lasantha Wijeratne, who released his book Wasteful Development And Corruption last week and gave a copy to ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa.</p>

      <p>"Four men broke into the house and stabbed him in the arm after holding a pistol to his wife's head," Wijeratne's lawyer Tharaka Nanayakkara told AFP by telephone. "They smashed furniture before escaping."</p>
      <p>Nanayakkara said the attackers accused Wijeratne of harming the campaign of Gotabaya Rajapaksa who is believed to be in a close race with Premadasa for the top job.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya is the brother of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, during whose decade in power until 2015 at least 14 journalists were killed according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF).</p>
      <p>Police said they launched an investigation into the incident in the south of the island nation, but were yet to arrest any suspects.</p>
      <p>It came even as Election Commission chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said the campaign had been relatively peaceful compared to previous polls.</p>
      <p>However, he said the behaviour of both private and state-controlled television networks had been highly biased and he hoped to prosecute offenders after the election.</p>

        <b>MEDIA CAMPAIGN 'WORST EVER' </b>
      </p>
      <p>No media organisation has been prosecuted for violating election laws, but last week Deshapriya banned a state TV network from broadcasting any political content after accusing it of partisan coverage.</p>
      <p>However, the Commission reversed the move the next day following protests that it was not being even-handed with all media outlets violating campaign rules governing broadcasts.</p>
      <p>"The run-up to the election was relatively peaceful, but the campaign in the media is the worst we have ever seen," Deshapriya said.</p>
      <p>Campaign rallies ended Wednesday night leaving two days of cooling period before Saturday's poll at which 15.99 million people are eligible to elect a leader from a record 35 candidates - including two Buddhist monks and just one woman.</p>
      <p>Frontrunners Premadasa and Rajapaksa wrapped up their final rallies amid tight security involving hundreds of elite police and paramilitary units.</p>
      <p>Premadasa, 52, is the son of assassinated president Ranasinghe Premadasa who was targeted by a suicide bomber during a rally in Colombo in 1993.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa narrowly escaped a suicide bomb attack in 2006 blamed on Tamil Tiger separatist rebels.</p>
      <p>While ethnic tensions have eased, this year the country was rocked by coordinated Islamist extremist bombings on Easter Sunday that killed at least 269 people.</p>
      <p>The European Union on Wednesday despatched 30 additional election observers around the country, joining 50 who have been in Sri Lanka for a month following the campaign.</p>
