      <p>The world’s largest charter owner and manager of container ships keeps getting larger.</p>
      <p>Vancouver-based Seaspan Corp. has agreed to buy a fleet of six container ships for $380 million US in cash. The deal, which will be financed via borrowings and cash on hand, is expected to close in December.</p>
      <p>The acquisition will increase Seaspan’s container cargo fleet to 119 ships. Its capacity will be one million 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) and give it a 7.7% share of a global container cargo fleet that shipping data company Alphaliner estimates now has a capacity exceeding 23 million TEUs.</p>
      <p>Bing Chen, Seaspan president and CEO, called the deal a “win-win outcome for one of our key financing partners, a key customer and for Seaspan … and [will] further cement Seaspan’s position as the leading global independent charter owner and operator of container ships.” </p>
      <p>Seaspan’s fleet has grown consistently from the 10 ships it had at its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2005.</p>
      <p>Its customers include Hapag-Lloyd, Maersk, Yang Ming and other top international container shipping lines.</p>
      <p>Chen revealed the six-ship purchase during Seaspan’s third-quarter earnings conference call when he noted that the company had closed a $500-million US “accordion to our portfolio financing program, increasing the financing to $1.5 billion.”</p>
