      <h1>Rescuing Xhaka from Arsenal and other midfielders West Ham should target in January</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers are crying out for a new midfielder in the transfer window, but will they have the money to do it?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham fans are crying out for the club to sign a new midfielder in the upcoming January transfer window and on current form, they are not wrong in their want.</p>
      <p>The Hammers are struggling in the engine room of the team with Declan Rice battling to keep his head above water week after week as Mark Noble's form dropped off.</p>
      <p>The link between midfield and attack has been very wide in recent games as well as the Hammers embarked on a dreadful run of six without a win prior to the international break.</p>
      <p>While there seems to be a few areas that need addressing, midfield is arguably one of the most pressing as it has been a real problem area for manager Manuel Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>A box-to-box midfielder with a decent engine seems to be the need and the solution to the problems that Pellegrini is struggling to find an answer for at the moment during the dire run.</p>
      <p>But what are the options out there that could be in reach for Pellegrini? There has been no news about what a potential budget for the January window could be though there is a strong suspicion that it won't be much following a £150m spree the past two summers.</p>
      <h3>Franck Kessie</h3>

      <p>The AC Milan midfielder has been linked with a move to West Ham before, most recently this past summer but his name has done the rounds for a move for some time.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is also of interest to Wolves and was linked to them in the summer too.</p>
      <p>He's played ten times for AC Milan so far this season, scoring once but has always been touted for a move away from the San Siro but nothing has ever come to fruition.</p>
      <p>Kessie is not a flair player, he's more of a workhorse but can get from box-to-box which is what the Hammers are crying out for. Last season he had on-loan Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko for company in a defensive midfield role which allowed Kessie to get to work.</p>
      <p>The catch? He could cost £20m at least, maybe even more and do the Hammers have that kind of budget?</p>
      <h3>Charles Aranguiz</h3>
      <p>Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Aranguiz was a target of manager Manuel Pellegrini in the summer but he said his fellow Chilean turned down a switch, saying: "I will not talk about conversations, but I can tell you that I would have loved to have many Chilean players... tried to take Aránguiz to West Ham, but he did not want to."</p>
      <p>But that hasn't stopped his name being thrown into the ring for a move as the manager made it clear he is an admirer of the 30-year-old but whether the midfielder would be interested in a move is up for debate as he's already turned down the Hammers once before.</p>
      <p>Plus, Bayer Leverkusen aren't too keen on losing the Chilean either so it would be a tough deal to get over the line.</p>
      <h3>Granit Xhaka</h3>

      <p>The Arsenal man's struggles in north London are very well documented and it all came to a head in recent weeks when he was swore at Gunners fans booing him off the field after another tumultuous outing.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery has refused to say whether Xhaka, who has been stripped of the captaincy at the Emirates, will stay at the club beyond January and he hasn't played for Arsenal in their last three outings.</p>
      <p>If the Hammers are serious about strengthening their midfield then they could swoop in for a loan deal with a view to buy to rescue the Swiss star from his Arsenal nightmare.</p>
      <h3>Maarten De Roon</h3>
      <p>The Dutchman has rejuvenated himself in Italy with Atalanta following his move from Middlesbrough in 2017, scoring nine goals since arriving and seeing his stock rise a fair bit.</p>
      <p>De Roon is a permanent fixture in midfield for Atalanta, making 141 appearances and can also fill in a defensive midfield role as well should Declan Rice pick up an injury.</p>
      <p>He's picked up nine assists so far for Atalanta as well and could be the solution Pellegrini is looking for.</p>
