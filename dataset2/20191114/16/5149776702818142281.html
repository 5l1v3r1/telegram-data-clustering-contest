      <h1>Notts County boss Neal Ardley vows not to go on the defensive in FA Cup clash at Northampton</h1>
      <h2>Magpies head to Sixfields as they seek third round place</h2>

      <p>Neal Ardley insists Notts County will not go on the defensive against Northampton Town but admits the Cobblers will be a “real challenge” to their hopes of FA Cup glory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley’s</a> side will head to Sixfields at the end of the month for the second round clash with the winners hoping to land a glamour tie against a Premier League team as a reward.</p>
      <p>Managed by former <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> boss Keith Curle, Northampton will be favourites going into the game with Town currently ninth in League Two, one division above the Magpies.</p>
      <p>While Notts boss Ardley is eager to measure the progress of his team against an EFL side, he is adamant he will not change his methods of playing attacking football when the two sides square-up.</p>
      <p>“We are going to a team in the level above and they should have bigger and better players,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Northampton will challenge us in general play and from set-pieces.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve got some big players ourselves if we can keep them fit going into that tie.</p>
      <p>“Whether we have six big ones to cope with their big six ones, is a different kettle of fish.</p>

      <p>“It’s going to be a real challenge. But it’s only down the road and we will take a fantastic following.</p>
      <p>“We are not afraid to lose. Last season we were because of the situation we were in.</p>
      <p>“We won’t go on the defensive, we have a way of how we play and that won’t change be it Saturday against Barrow as well as any cup game.”</p>
      <p>Curle’s side are currently in decent form after a slow start but hopes are high they can challenge for promotion to League One.</p>
      <p>Ardley has already begun to do his homework on the Cobblers and is already aware of the threat they will pose due to their physical presence.</p>
      <p>And he has warned his Notts side that if they cannot stand up to the imposing nature of Town, their hopes of an FA Cup third round place and a potential draw against a top flight team will go up in smoke.</p>
      <p>“I would have liked a home tie especially with the way we have been playing at Meadow Lane,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I did want a League Two team because I feel it will give us a good look at where we are.</p>
      <p>“Keith Curle has done well there. They had a slow start, but they have picked up and are on the verge of the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“They are in good form and the one thing that they are, aside from the fact they have good players, is they are very big.</p>
      <p>“They have two 6ft 3in centre-forwards, centre-backs and a 6ft 2in central midfielder.</p>
      <p>“They will test us at set-pieces, they will get balls into the box and if we don’t stand up to that we will struggle in the game.”</p>
