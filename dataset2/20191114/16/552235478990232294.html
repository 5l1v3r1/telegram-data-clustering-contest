      <h1>Adam Bogdan to rejoin Hibs as club strengthen squad while manager search continues</h1>
      <h2>The 32-year-old is a free agent after leaving Liverpool in the summer and is close to agreeing terms with his former side.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:41:27+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Adam Bogdan is set to re-sign for Hibs with the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> keeper close to penning a deal until January at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old is a free agent after leaving Anfield in the summer and is close to agreeing terms with his former side.</p>
      <p>The ex-Bolton man failed to find another club after his exit but kept in touch with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> , paving the way for his impending return.</p>
      <p>The goalie spent last season on loan with the Leith outfit and has a chance to claim the No.1 spot with Ofir Marciano falling down the pecking order and finding his future in doubt.</p>

      <p>Marciano recently said: “I have a contract for another year after this season but it's impossible to know if I'll leave.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Hibs are continuing the search for their new manager after the sacking of Paul Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p>Jack Ross is odds-on to get the job after he interviewed for the position this week, as well as city rivals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> .</p>
