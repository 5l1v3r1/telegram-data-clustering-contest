      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-overseas-bank">Indian Overseas Bank </a>has reported a divergence of Rs 2,262 crore in provisioning for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bad-loans">bad loans </a>in the year ended March 2019. The bank had earlier reported non-performing asset (NPA) provisions of Rs 18,647.23 crore for 2018-19, while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) assessed a provisioning for Rs 20,909.23 crore.</p>
      <p>Taking the provisioning divergence into account, the bank’s notional loss after tax goes up to Rs 5,999.88 crore, against the Rs 3,737.88 crore reported earlier.</p>
      <p>The divergence includes provisions attributed to valuation of investments, at Rs 281 crore. The gross NPA reported by the bank was Rs 33,398.12 crore for 2018-19, while the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rbi">RBI </a>assessment pegged it at Rs 33,756.12 crore — a divergence of Rs 358 crore. The net NPA reported by the bank earlier was Rs 14,368.3 crore, but <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rbi">RBI </a>assessed it at Rs 16,295.3 crore — a divergence of Rs 1,927 crore.</p>
      <p>The divergence disclosure comes against the backdrop of a tightening in asset-quality-disclosure norms for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/finance-news-banks-1030101.htm">banks </a>by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).</p>
      <p>Sebi had recently directed all listed lenders to make disclosures pertaining to divergences and provisioning within a day of receiving the RBI’s final risk assessment report.</p>
