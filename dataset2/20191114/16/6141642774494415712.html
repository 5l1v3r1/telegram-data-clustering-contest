      <h2>JERSEY Race Club broke all sorts of records in what turned out to be a stellar year, although financial concerns still remain with regards to attracting sponsorship to prop up one of the Island’s top spectator sports.</h2>

      <p>Modern day records were set in the 2019 season for the amount of overall runners, runners per meet and runners per race, with profit taken from tote betting rising by 39.5%.</p>
      <p>President Mark Johnson will present his report at the Race Club’s AGM next month and the majority of the news is good news. However, he said sponsorship is still a problem – something that has also struck the UK racing industry.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘It has been great, the tote money has been great, profit was £25,400, with £17,000 on Ladies Day being our biggest tote turnover ever.</p>
      <p>‘There were 316 runners last year, with the previous high being 295 in 2016.</p>
      <p>‘It has been really positive, we have had a good year and there is a feel-good factor back around racing in Jersey.</p>
      <p>‘But to balance that out we still have concerns over sponsorship but it isn’t just us, it is in the UK too.</p>
      <p>‘Six races went un-sponsored last year, four were only partly sponsored and that gave us a shortfall of £23,750, which nullifies the tote money in one hit.</p>
      <p>‘It is a struggle so we want people to get the word out, but it is tough and that is shown in the UK.’</p>
      <p>JRC was getting around 2,000 spectators to meets last season, with visitor and tourist numbers coming to Les Landes both up.</p>
      <p>Over 30 jockeys rode on the cards and it was helped by a feature being screened in Jersey and on ITV Racing’s main programme.</p>
      <p>Jersey has also garnered praise from top riders following extensive work to put in new hurdles.</p>
      <p>Johnson added: ‘We had Sam Twiston-Davies over and Brian Hughes who said the hurdles were among the best they had raced over.</p>
      <p>‘A total of 56 runners contested the nine hurdle races, with no horses falling and no horses unseating riders.</p>
      <p>‘There was a real positive vibe at the racecourse and it was great to hear people talk positively about going racing at Les Landes around the Island, in the UK, and on the plans in between.’</p>
      <p>Prize money for four big races in 2020 – which will again feature nine meetings, including a Liberation 75 event – will increase to £4,000, up from £3,500.</p>
