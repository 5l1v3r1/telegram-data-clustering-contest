      <p>Rail services in parts of Bangladesh including capital Dhaka were on Thursday suspended after six compartments of a train derailed following a devastating engine fire.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Railways Secretary, Mofazzal Hossain told journalists that three bogies caught fire after the derailment of the intercity train `Rangpur Express’ while crossing Ullapara station in Sirajganj district, 134 km northwest of Dhaka.</p>
      <p>“Six compartments and engine of the Rangpur Express veered off the tracks while it was passing through Ullahpara Station at 2:15 p.m. local time, said Hossain.</p>
      <p>“The accident occurred after the train’s engine caught fire due to technical glitches,’’ the official said.</p>
      <p>Several units of Fire Service and Civil Defence rushed to the accident site and managed to douse the fire.</p>
      <p>A five-member committee has been formed to investigate the incident.</p>
      <p>Hossain, however, said they are not aware of any injuries.</p>
      <p>Somoy TV, a leading Bangla 24-hour news television channel, but the number of injured people undergoing treatment at 10 as many passengers jumped from the slow-moving train.</p>
      <p>There are many unmanned level crossings along the Bangladesh railway across the country, where most of the railway tracks are in a dilapidated condition.,these often cause accidents.</p>
      <p>A head-on collision between two trains killed 16 people early Tuesday in Bangladesh.</p>
