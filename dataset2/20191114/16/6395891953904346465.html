      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - The State Department's inspector general has found that an employee working on Iranian policy was improperly removed from her post because of her ethnic background and perceived political views.</p>
      <p>The internal watchdog recommends internal discipline for any officials involved in removing the employee in the early days of the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>A senior State Department official mentioned in the report denied that he took improper action.</p>
      <p>The report released Thursday does not name the employee, but it matches the description of woman of Iranian descent who was perceived as being a supporter of President Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>The inspector general found no wrongdoing in the reassignment of two other employees and make no conclusion in two other cases it examined.</p>
