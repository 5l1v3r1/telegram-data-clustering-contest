      <p>Adulterers who may have taken the secret of an extramarital affair to the grave are being outed 500 years later.</p>
      <p>In the modern day the question of paternity can be solved with a simple test, but things were not so easy five centuries ago.</p>
      <p>However, researchers have put DNA evidence together with long-term genealogical data to explore questions of biological fatherhood on a broad scale, among people living in parts of western Europe over the last 500 years.</p>
      <p>Scientists found that while the overall number of so-called extra-pair paternity (EPP) events – women having babies with someone other than their partner – was fairly low, their frequency varied considerably among people depending on their circumstances.</p>
      <p>Evidence of EPP events appeared more often in people of lower socioeconomic status who lived in densely populated cities in the 19th century.</p>
      <blockquote>Our research shows that the chance of having extra-pair paternity events in your family history really depends on the social circumstances of your ancestors<cite>Maarten Larmuseau</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Study author Maarten Larmusea, of Belgian university KU Leuven, said: “Of course, extra-pair paternity, especially due to adultery, is a popular topic in gossip, jokes, TV series and literature.</p>
      <p>“But scientific knowledge on this phenomenon is still highly limited, especially regarding the past.</p>
      <p>“Our research shows that the chance of having extra-pair paternity events in your family history really depends on the social circumstances of your ancestors.”</p>
      <p>In terms of evolution, remaining faithful to a partner is not always the most advantageous strategy.</p>
      <p>Males may benefit from straying by siring extra offspring, and females may benefit by mating with superior males.</p>
      <p>The researchers looked at how often this has happened in human societies over time.</p>
      <p>Their study, published in Current Biology, covered several centuries during which there were dramatic changes in the human social environment.</p>
      <p>These included the urbanisation that accompanied the Industrial Revolution in 19th century western Europe.</p>
      <blockquote><b>1%<br/></b>Estimated average rate of extra-pair paternity events</blockquote>
      <p>To estimate historical EPP rates among married couples, researchers identified 513 pairs of contemporary adult males living in Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Based on genealogical evidence the men shared a common paternal ancestor and therefore – barring an EPP event – should have carried the same Y chromosome.</p>
      <p>If the researchers found a mismatch that could not be explained by mutation between the Y chromosome genotypes of the men in a pair, this indicated at least a single EPP event happened in the genealogy leading from their common paternal ancestor.</p>
      <p>In 25 out of 96 mismatch cases (26%), Y chromosome genotypes of one or more additional DNA donors helped to further narrow down the exact part in the genealogy where the EPP event happened.</p>
      <p>The scientists also obtained genealogical records of all paternal ancestors, including their year and place of birth, and social class based on their occupation.</p>
      <p>The evidence showed no significant difference in EPP rates between countries despite key religious differences, according to the study.</p>
      <p>But they varied widely with socioeconomic status and population density.</p>
      <p>The EPP rate was much lower among farmers and better off craftsmen and merchants – about 1% – than among lower class labourers and weavers – about 4%.</p>
      <p>The rates also rose with population density.</p>
      <p>Putting the two together, the researchers suggest the estimated EPP rates for the families varied by more than one order of magnitude.</p>
      <p>This was about 0.5% among the middle to high classes and farmers living in the most sparsely populated towns, to almost 6% for the low socioeconomic classes living in the most densely populated cities.</p>
      <p>They say the findings support evolutionary theories suggesting individual incentives and opportunities for seeking or preventing extra-pair mating should depend on the social context.</p>
      <p>The scientists argue their findings debunk the notion that EPP rates in western society are generally high, noting the evidence puts average rates at around 1%.</p>
