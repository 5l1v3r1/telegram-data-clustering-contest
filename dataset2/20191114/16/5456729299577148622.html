      <p>Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State on Thursday presented a N119.5 billion budget to the state House of Assembly for the 2020 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Mr Oyetola, while presenting the budget tagged, ‘Budget of Restoration’, said the presentation of the budget was in accordance with Section 121(1) of the 1999 constitution, as amended.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the budget is below the 2019 budget of 152.7bn.</p>
      <p>The governor gave the recurrent expenditure as N57. 6 billion, representing 48.24 per cent, while the capital expenditure stood at N61. 8bn, representing 51.76 per cent.</p>
      <p>Under the reccurent expenditure, he said N36. 5bn representing 30.50 per cent would be spent on personnel, N20.009 billion, representing 16.74 per cent accounted for overhead and N1. 2bn, representing 1 per cent would be for Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

      <p>On capital expenditure, N4. 3 billion, representing 6.97 per cent would go for health, N6. 5 billion, representing 10.53 per cent for education, N2. 3 billion, representing 3.82 per cent for agriculture and N4. 3 billion, representing 6.99 per cent for governance and administration sector, among others.</p>
      <p>Mr Oyetola, however, said the expected revenue in 2019 budget fell below the state government expectation, stressing the need for government to redouble its effort in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) drive.</p>
      <p>The governor urged the lawmakers on the need for a speedy passage of the budget.</p>
      <p>Earlier in his remarks, the speaker of the assembly, Timothy Owoeye, promised quick passage of the budget by the parliament.</p>
      <p>Mr Owoeye said the aim of the parliament was to put the state on the path of economic growth and stability.</p>
