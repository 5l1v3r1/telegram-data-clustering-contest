      <h1>Why rush hour traffic congestion on the Tyne Bridge has been even worse than normal</h1>
      <h2>Council bosses have discovered that traffic lights on the Gateshead side of the bridge are suffering a communications fault that drivers have complained is causing 'horrendous' queues</h2>

      <p>If you’ve noticed that traffic has been even worse than usual driving into Newcastle over the Tyne Bridge for the last few days, this could explain why.</p>
      <p>City highways bosses have confirmed that traffic lights on the Gateshead side of the bridge are suffering from an “intermittent fault” which is disrupting the timing of the signals and causing big rush hour queues.</p>
      <p>Drivers have complained of “horrendous” tailbacks on their morning commute this week, and Newcastle City Council has now pledged to fix the problem “as quickly as we can”.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the council, which is responsible for all traffic lights in Tyne and Wear, said: “We have been working to resolve an intermittent fault affecting traffic signals at the end of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-bridge">Tyne Bridge</a> in Gateshead.</p>

      <p>“The fault has been traced to a problem with the communications line linking the traffic lights with the main traffic signals network.</p>
      <p>“This has been causing problems with the timing and coordination of traffic lights at a series of junctions on the approach to the bridge, which is affecting traffic flows in the area and is resulting in delays during peak times.</p>
      <p>“We are working with the communications network provider to fix the problem as quickly as we can and would ask that people bear with us while we get this resolved.”</p>
      <p>Motorists have taken to Twitter to complain about the heavy delays this week, with queues reportedly stretching back as far as Heworth.</p>
      <p>Vicki Paul said: “What is going on with traffic on a morning, over the past 2 weeks it has took an hour or more to get along the felling bypass and over the bridge!!! Which would normally take me 20-30 mins max! And I leave at 7.30 in the morning to start for 9am and been late all week!”</p>
      <p>Richard Fawcett wrote: “I think the phasing on the last set of lights before the bridge going north have changed, which is just killing traffic flow. They were turning red as the set of lights before were going green, which is not what's supposed to happen. "This added 50 minutes to my journey today.”</p>
      <p>Drivers will be hoping that the disruption is not a sign of things to come, with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/tyne-bridge-lanes-clean-air-16888386">major changes planned for the Tyne Bridge from 2021</a> that will make it far more difficult to get into Newcastle.</p>
      <p>As part of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/clean-air-toll-newcastle-centre-16875900">plans to cut air pollution on Tyneside</a> , general traffic will be reduced from two lanes to one in each direction over the iconic crossing.</p>
      <p>Council bosses hope that the move will force motorists out of their cars and onto public transport.</p>
      <p>The bridge will have a northbound bus lane, which will also be used by taxis, while its other remaining lane is expected to be shut completely for long-awaited maintenance work. If local councils cannot get funding for the overdue restoration of the bridge in time, the remaining lane would also be used as a bus lane.</p>
      <p>Gateshead Council leader Martin Gannon has said that he hopes the changes will not cause gridlock south of the river, as drivers will make the “rational decision” to use public transport rather than endure the congestion.</p>
