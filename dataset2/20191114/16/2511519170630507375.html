      <h2>Laura Ingraham at one point suggests she thought a water bottle was an 'oxygen chamber'</h2>

      <p>After a day of public testimony in which Americans were told directly by top officials that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> attempted to coerce the president of Ukraine into digging up dirt on a political rival, the political punditry in the United States had plenty to work with — yet Fox News attacked one of the witnesses for drinking too much water.</p>
      <p>Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo led the charge during an appearance on the Ingraham Angle, a weeknight talk show hosted by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/laura-ingraham">Laura Ingraham</a>.</p>
      <p>For a portion of the show in question, they chose to hone in on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/george-kent">George Kent</a>, a top State Department official to Ukraine, who had brought a large blue water bottle to the hearings.</p>
      <p>“He drank a lot of water, Laura. I mean, fish are not this hydrated,” Arroyo said as footage of Mr Kent drinking water played. “Look, he’s — he’s always taking slugs — look, throughout the hearing, he took slugs of this thing.”</p>
      <p>“What is this, is he on the treadmill? What is this with the water?” Ingraham replied, apparently exasperated by Mr Kent’s hydration routine. Then, with a red circle drawn around the bottle as if it were incriminating evidence, she continued: “Do you guys see that?” </p>
      <p>Arroyo certainly did see it.</p>
      <p>“It’s amazing,” he added. “It was like a medical sized water tower… A water silo.”</p>
      <p>Then Ingraham decided to take it a step further, and suggested that she “thought had hid an oxygen chamber or something.”</p>
