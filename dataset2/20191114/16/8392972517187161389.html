      <p>They added, for clarity: "You only get the sensor mat, the door mats are £2.99."</p>
      <p>According to the back of the packaging, the mat is placed under a doormat and comes with an upright speaker to be positioned nearby.</p>
      <p>The speaker can also be mounted on a wall, as it has a hole in the back for hanging on a nail or screw. It is operated with two AA batteries.</p>
