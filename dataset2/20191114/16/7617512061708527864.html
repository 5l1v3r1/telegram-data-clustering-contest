      <p>Zero-emission vehicles accounted for 3.5% of new passenger car sales in Canada — with B.C. leading the pack since a new federal subsidy was introduced in May, said a new report by Electric Mobility Canada.</p>
      <p>For the third quarter (July through September), zero emission vehicles accounted for about 8% of new light duty vehicle sales in B.C. Year-to-date, the vehicles accounted for 8.5% of new vehicle sales in B.C. in 2019.</p>
      <p>Quebec had the second-highest rate at 7%.</p>
      <p>The spike in sales of battery electric, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen vehicles were the result of a new federal subsidy that can be stacked on top of provincial subsidies in both B.C. and Quebec.</p>
      <p>When the $5,000 federal rebate was combined with provincial subsidies, it meant British Columbians were eligible for up to $16,000 — $5,000 under the B.C. program and up to $6,000 for trading in an older car under the Scrap It program.</p>
      <p>The province has since dropped the rebate to $3,000.</p>
      <p>Under the CleanBC program, the province is mandating that 10% of new cars sold in B.C. to be low or zero emission by 2025. Year-to-date, B.C. is already about 2% away from that target.</p>
