      <h1>Litecoin Correction Causes Serious Bearish Action, Why Further Pullback is Likely</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>LTC broke out of a channel to a new descending wedge after dropping below $61 price levels earlier today.</li>
        <li>The price rejection at $66 price levels has made Litecoin stay under a bearish pressure since the weekly opening.</li>
        <li>Litecoin may gain bullish momentum if the price can reclaim $61, which appeared to be a critical confluence zone for the market.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/why-litecoin-may-soon-post-major-gains-despite-current-bearishness/">Litecoin</a> has witnessed a lot of price reductions over the past three days due to a significant correction which is making the bears gain control of the market.</p>
      <p>However, a bullish step back is expected for LTC, once it climbs back above $60 price level, although the $61 resistance is an essential level for the next bullish phase on the hourly chart.</p>
      <h3>Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Following November 10, rejection at $66, Litecoin has remained in a downward range. The latest bearish scenario has caused<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/14/crypto-market-bitcoin-remains-at-risk-ltc-bnb-bch-trx-analysis/"> LTC</a> to trade inside a descending wedge, but the price is now sitting on the lower boundary of the wedge.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a retracement could be underway to the upper boundary of the wedge at $60. A break above the wedge could allow the bulls to regain control of the market. This could bring the next resistance levels at $62, followed by a decent rally to $64.6 resistance levels.</p>
      <p>Litecoin is currently holding near support at $58. This support could become weak if we continue to witness a devastating price drop.</p>
      <p>However, we may need to keep an eye on the $57 and $56 supports in the next swing low. Additionally, Litecoin is still showing a bullish sign on the daily chart.</p>
      <h3>Litecoin to Enter the Bullish Trend</h3>
      <p>The market structure looks bullish on the higher time frame, but, the lower time frame is currently suggesting a bearish mode for Litecoin.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the last three days’ downward direction is just a sign of a small pullback on the daily chart. We can expect a bullish continuation in the next couple of days. Otherwise, we may continue to see a decline until Litecoin finds vital support for a rebound.</p>
