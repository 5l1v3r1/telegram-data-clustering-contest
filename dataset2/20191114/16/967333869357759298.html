      <p>Twitter users didn't appreciate the content, labelling it Hareem’s vulgar workout videos and “18+”.</p>

      <p>​Taking a jibe back at the haters, Hareem re-tweeted one of her exercise videos on Thursday, while asking her haters what exactly they found “vulgar”.</p>
      <p>However, after brutal netizens had befitting replies to her question, she deleted her tweet.</p>
      <p>Replying to her gym videos, some compared her twerking moves to an “earthquake”, while others called her an “aunty, or noted that she was over-exercising”.</p>

      <p>​The Pakistani entertainer has often been mocked for her bizarre social media posts.</p>
      <p>Sometimes she compares herself to Indian actress Katrina Kaif, sometimes she announces she declined a Bollywood movie opposite superstar Shah Rukh Khan because she is a “patriot”.</p>

      <p>​Earlier in October, Hareem <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910231077128852-pakistan-tik-tok-queen-occupies-pms-chair-draws-twitteratis-fury/">came under fire</a> for making a TikTok video inside the Pakistani Foreign Ministry's Jamshed Marker Hall while sitting on a chair reserved for Prime Minister Imran Khan. Hareem later deleted the video from her Twitter account.</p>

      <p>​On 30 October, Hareem claimed to have recorded a video of a “famous Pakistani cricketer” allegedly exposing himself to her while he masturbated.</p>
      <blockquote>“I was on video call with a famous Pakistani cricketer &amp; he started masturbating. I recorded the video. Do you want to see it? The cricketer's face is visible in the video,” she wrote in a tweet, only to delete it later.</blockquote>
