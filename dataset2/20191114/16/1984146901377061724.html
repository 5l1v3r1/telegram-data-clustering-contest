      <h1>Newcastle West End charity speaks out about the importance of paying staff the living wage</h1>
      <h2>With the real living wage increasing, The Scotswood Natural Community Garden urges more employers to join the movement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Nichol</a></address>
      <p>With thousands of people in the North East struggling to make ends meet, campaigners are urging for more employers to start paying their staff the real living wage.</p>
      <p>As the first and longest serving living wage employer in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Tyne and Wear</a>, this West End community garden is proud to be part of the living wage movement.</p>
      <p>After seeing first hand the levels of poverty that people live in their community, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">The Scotswood Natural Community Garden</a> is determined to encourage other employers to increase staff pay.</p>
      <p>And now the charity has been invited to speak at the North East Living Wage Week conference at Newcastle University as part of Living Wage Week.</p>

      <p>The real living wage is independently calculated based on living costs and is higher than the national living wage, which the Government introduced in 2016 for all staff aged over 25.</p>
      <p>Following a Government announcement on Monday, the 6,000 employers who have signed up to the voluntary scheme will lift their UK hourly rate by 30p to £9.30 and have six months to do so.</p>
      <p>But campaigners want to see more employers signing up to stop poverty amongst workers.</p>
      <p>And The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/scotswood">Scotswood</a> Natural Community Garden is no stranger to seeing the effects that poverty has on their community.</p>
      <p>Starting in 1995, the project teaches thousands of people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds about the environment while having a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Since 2012, the environmental project has been accredited as a Living Wage employer.</p>
      <p>And after receiving an email from Newcastle University invited them to talk at the real living wage conference, the group were surprised to be informed that they are Tyne and Wear’s first and longest living wage employer.</p>

      <p>Karen Dobson, CEO, said "In 2012 we looked at 60% at the time of children living in poverty had one parent that was working and weren’t getting paid enough so couldn't afford life necessities.</p>
      <p>"Because we are in a deprived community in terms of economic deprivation we see a lot of poverty first hand.</p>
      <p>"It so important that we are seen to be supporting the real living wage movement, the way to address poverty in our opinion is to pay people the money that they deserve so they can afford to live.</p>
      <p>"Yes, we are only a small charity but it should be bigger organisations companies should be campaigning for it."</p>
      <p>The community garden ensure that their suppliers are all accredited living wage employers and aim to get supplies from local business.</p>
      <p>While ensuring their staff are paid the real living wage, the charity ensures to help people living in poverty as much as they can.</p>
      <p>The garden donates food to those in their community that are in need, while also teaching people how to cook healthy at home.</p>
      <p>Karen added: "A lot of our volunteers are in long term unemployment or suffer from mental health issues.</p>
      <p>"Coming here gives them a purpose and getting active outside really helps their mental health.</p>
      <p>"We do all we can to help. We have shared lunches we cook for people, we give people food who to take away and some we help teach people who haven't been able to cook as they can't afford cooker how to cook."</p>
