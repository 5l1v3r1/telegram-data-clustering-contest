      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off Indonesia on Thursday, but there's no tsunami threat to Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.</p>
      <p>The quake, initially measured at a magnitude of 7.4, happened around 6:20 a.m. HST.</p>
      <p>According to the U.S. Geological Survey, it was closest to Kota Ternate.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear whether there were any injuries or damage.</p>
      <p>The PTWC said the temblor was too far away from Hawaii to have any kind of effect.</p>
