      <p>Turkish authorities have imposed a travel ban on Emma Hedvig Christina Winberg, wife of former British intelligence officer and White Helmets founder <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911111077278912-founder-of-white-helmets-james-le-mesurier-found-dead-in-istanbul---reports/">James Le Mesurier who was found dead in Istanbul</a> 10th November, <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkey-slaps-travel-ban-on-ex-mi6-officers-wife/1645357">Turkish media reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Winberg, a Swedish citizen, has provided much information to local media – and police – about Le Mesurier since his abrupt and mysterious death, including the claim he’d contemplated suicide 15 days before his death, and had been taking a variety of psychiatric medications in the final weeks of his life.</p>
      <blockquote>She also alleges her husband took sleeping pills on the day of incident, and she was sleeping when the incident took place early in the morning. She also said they’d received no visitors on the day of the incident, and had moved to the house in Beyoglu after Le Mesurier began to get injection and drug treatment due to a stress disorder, as they needed to stay close to a health institution.</blockquote>
