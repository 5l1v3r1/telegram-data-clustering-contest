      <h1>I always think about beating Magnus Carlsen: Anish Giri</h1>

      <p>CHENNAI: The upcoming Tata Steel <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/chess">chess</a> tournament in Kolkata - to be held from November 22-26 - is headlined by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/magnus-carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> who returns to the country six years after he was crowned a world champion.</p>
      <p>Carlsen taking on five-time former world champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/viswanathan-anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> is being given the top billing. However, the tournament will be special for one more player - <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anish-Giri">Anish Giri</a> - for whom the trip to India will be a homecoming of sorts.</p>
      <p>"Despite having an Indian grandmother and a Nepalese father, I have never been to India before. I have been to Nepal a couple of times, which isn't that far. I have a lot of Indian friends, and so I have some idea of what I am about to experience," the world no. 5 told TOI. Anish's father Sanjay hails from Nepal while his mother Olga is a Russian.</p>
      <p>A packed schedule may deny the Dutch Grandmaster a chance to visit his grandmother's birthplace -Varanasi - but he doesn't mind seeing a few places in Kolkata or even try the local cuisine.</p>
      <p>"I was hoping to make a bigger trip out of it, but the schedule is way too full. But I wouldn't mind trying the Indian food as long as it's not too spicy. I already have a few recommendations on the restaurants I should visit," said the 25-year-old.</p>
      <p>The event in Kolkata will give Anish another chance to take on Carlsen. The two never miss an opportunity for a friendly banter on the social media, and Anish is looking forward to the contest.</p>
      <p>"I always think about beating Carlsen. In that sense, I don't give much importance to where the battle takes place. This tournament will give a chance to meet the Indian chess fans as well."</p>
      <p>Anish, who won the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shenzhen-Masters">Shenzhen Masters</a> this year, is keen on putting together consistent performances before he gears up for the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/2020-Candidates">2020 Candidates</a> which will be held in Yekaterinburg, Russia from March 15 to April 5.</p>
      <p>"I am about to qualify for the Candidates by the average rating of this year, and with that in mind I can't be unsatisfied (about how the year has gone). Winning the Shenzhen Masters was one of my highlights this year. I did well in Zagreb and Saint Louis tournaments despite having a bad start. I want to approach Candidates next year at the peak of my performance," said Anish.</p>
