      <p>A Wishaw school’s sports programme is officially gold standard.</p>
      <p>Calderbridge Primary has been awarded a Sportscotland Gold Award from sportscotland in recognition for their work in promoting sport and fitness amongst the pupils.</p>
      <p>Steve Lytham, from sportscotland, was on hand to present pupils with their new gold flag and he heard more about the school’s programme.</p>
      <p>Calderbridge class teacher Jacqui Wilson said: “We have had great support from parents, staff and the Active Schools team.</p>
      <p>“All of our clubs are run by volunteers which is great for the pupils.</p>
      <p>“We have had clubs such as cheerleading, football and basketball amongst others.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The school’s sports committee is made up of pupils and they tell us what they would like to do and then it’s up to us to see if we can provide.</p>
      <p>“We have also provided the pupils with the experience of mixing with athletes.</p>
      <p>“For example we had the chance to meet the Danish gymnastics team when they were training at Ravenscraig.”</p>
