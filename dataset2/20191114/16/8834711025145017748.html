      <h1>NGOs Implicated In Esidimeni Deaths To Appear Before SIU Tribunal</h1>

      <p>Thirteen nonprofit organisations implicated in the deaths of at least 144 Life Esidimeni patients are due to appear before the Special Investigating Unit’s Tribunal soon for alleged fraud.</p>
      <p>Retired Judge Dikgang Moseneke recommended the Gauteng government investigate the organisations after the Esidimeni commission found they allegedly benefited over R5.5 million through fake invoices.</p>
      <p>The NGOs were found to be ill-equipped to look after the psychiatric patients who died during transfers across the province in 2016.</p>
      <p>The Special Investigating Unit has started with its crackdown on 28 NGOs facing several allegations of wrongdoing in connection with the Life Esidimeni tragedy.</p>
      <p>The SIU tribunal has completed its first phase of investigations into the 13 NGOs accused of illegally pocketing around R5.5 million.</p>
      <p>Tribunal spokesperson Selby Mokgotho said: “The civil claims have been investigated and finalised to institute proceedings with the ultimate intention of the recovery of the money.”</p>
      <p>Mokgotho explains what will happen after they appear before the tribunal.</p>
      <p>“The tribunal will be able to grant orders where there is a need for suspension orders.”</p>
      <p>There’s been no accountability or concrete action against those responsible for the deaths since the tragedy three years ago.</p>
