      <h1>Why isn't Emmerdale on tonight? ITV scrap latest episode for Euro 2020 football coverage</h1>
      <h2>Emmerdale will not air on ITV tonight, with 7pm seeing live coverage of the Euro 2020 qualifier between England and Montenegro</h2>

      <p>Emmerdale viewers will not get their usual double episode fix of the ITV soap tonight, as both episodes have been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The channel has scrapped the episodes to make way for live coverage of the Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>England will take on Montenegro in their first match for the international football championships next year.</p>
      <p>It will air live on ITV from 7pm right after the ITV News, and continue until 10pm.</p>
      <p>This means the schedule for shows usually on at this time has been wiped, with Emmerdale not on at all today.</p>

      <p>There was an extra episode on Tuesday, when it aired for an hour-long episode.</p>
      <p>It's not sure when the "missing" episode will air, but with Tuesday often airing a second episode it's possibly already been sorted.</p>
      <p>Viewers seemed pretty annoyed over the news, with an ITV announcer confirming the next episode would air on Friday.</p>

      <p>One fan said: "ahhh football how dare it replace Emmerdale."</p>
      <p>Another tweeted a series of angry face emojis, as others commented on the show being replaced.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night, a spiralling Cain Dingle was told by ex Charity that she was stopping him from seeing his granddaughter Sarah, and even his sons Kyle and Isaac after his recent dangerous behaviour.</p>

      <p>Her young son Moses had been kidnapped by a gang who Cain had stolen a car from.</p>
      <p>Cain has hit self-destruct ever since he found out wife Moira had an affair with farmhand Nate Robinson.</p>
      <p>Nate turned out to be his secret son, who was targeting him as revenge for abandoning him as a baby - except Cain didn't even know he existed.</p>

        <b>Emmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode on Thursdays at 8pm.</b>
