      <p>Former Plymouth Argyle manager Carl Fletcher has been sacked by Leyton Orient only 29 days after being appointed as their head coach.</p>
      <p>Fletcher's first match in charge saw the O's triumph 4-0 away to Grimsby Town on October 19.</p>
      <p>They then lost 4-0 at Argyle the following Tuesday, which was the start of a run of five games without a win.</p>
      <p>Last time out they lost 2-1 at home to non-League Maldon and Tiptree in the FA Cup first round.</p>
      <p>With Orient sitting in 16th position in League Two, ahead of a home game against Scunthorpe United on Saturday, the club issued a statement about Fletcher on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>It read: Leyton Orient has today parted company with head coach, Carl Fletcher, with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Chairman, Nigel Travis, said, “It’s unfortunate for the Club that we have parted company with Carl after such a short time, particularly as we are a club that tries to preserve stability.</p>
      <p>“However, we felt this was in the best interests of all parties and we thank him for his hard work and wish him every success in the future.”</p>
      <p>Ross Embleton, Danny Webb and Jobi McAnuff will take control of first-team affairs in the meantime, as they did for an interim period at the beginning of the season.</p>
