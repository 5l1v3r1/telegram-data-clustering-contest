      <p>A West Bridgford pub has had to switch off its electricity after rain water started dripping down the walls.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/west-bridgford">Gordon Road</a>, home to the Test Match <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/">pub</a>, has been closed by police after severe rainfall battered the area and led to flooding across the city and county.</p>
      <p>The pub is staying open to customers.</p>
      <p>Assistant manager at the pub, Tanya Clifton-Forbes, described the flooding that was forming in Gordon Road.</p>
      <p>"I've worked here for six-and-a-half years and I've never seen it as bad as this before," she told Nottinghamshire Live.</p>
      <p>"People can't drive down Gordon Road, but we are staying open. If people can walk to see us we'll stay open. We'll have a cup of tea for them.</p>
      <p>"It really is shocking. Gordon Road is terrible.</p>

      <p>"Rain water has been running down one of the walls in the pub and we've had to turn off the electric and speakers on that wall.</p>
      <p>"Police have closed <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/west-bridgford">Gordon Road</a> in both directions. One of the officers told me they've been telling residents they may have to be evacuated if things get worse, but it's still early days.</p>
      <p>"The flood water has lifted off the man hole covers, so it isn't safe, it's sensible to close the road.</p>

      <p>"Exchange Road behind us is also really badly affected. One customer came in with black bags up to her hips."</p>
      <p>Flooding is causing significant disruption across Nottinghamshire today, Thursday, November 14, with roads closed following heavy rain.</p>
      <p>In the city centre <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/bus-services-facing-disruption-because-3537902">buses are being diverted</a> because of flooding in the Mansfield Road and Shakespeare Street area.</p>
