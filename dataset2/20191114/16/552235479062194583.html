      <p>Hundreds of people in West Lothian gathered to pay their respects at Remembrance events held around West Lothian on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Veterans and their families also joined well wishers in towns and villages around the county to fall silent to remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice in World War One and Two and in more recent conflicts around the world.</p>
      <p>People of all ages attended services and laid wreaths in areas including Livingston, Bathgate and Mid Calder and a special Armistice event was help at West Lothianâ€™s Civic Centre on Monday.</p>
