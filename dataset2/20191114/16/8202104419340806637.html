      <h3>One of two inmates who escaped from the Saskatoon Regional Psychiatric Centre remains at large.</h3>
      <p>Kendal Lee Campeau, 29, was arrested without incident on Thursday around 1:45 a.m. at a residence in the 500 block of Douglas Crescent by members of the Saskatoon police guns and gangs unit, with assistance from patrol and canine units.</p>

      <p>Matthew Shaundel Michel, 24, remains out of custody. He is described as 5-foot-5 and 146 pounds. He was last seen wearing all black clothing.</p>
      <p>Campeau and Michel were reported missing from the federal facility on Wednesday around 8:40 p.m., police told the StarPhoenix. Tim Krause, assistant warden management services at the psychiatric centre, said the escape happened at the institution itself and not during any transport or out-of-facility excursion.</p>
      <p>The centre is located on Central Avenue, on land leased from the University of Saskatchewan’s North Management Area.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">The institution is not identifying the level of security under which the two inmates are being held. RPC has minimum-, medium- and maximum-security inmates.</span>
      </p>
      <p>Both men are considered violent, according to Saskatoon police. There were no injuries associated with the escape, Krause said.</p>
      <p>When RPC staff realized there were patients unaccounted for and that there may have been an escape, an emergency lockdown and count were implemented. RPC remained under lockdown Thursday morning, which means patients are confined to their cells until normal operations can resume. The lockdown also means no visitors are allowed.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Campeau was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of attempted escape, kidnapping and forcibly seizing three guards at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre while armed with shanks made from an oven rack. He and two other inmates were drunk on prison-made alcohol and hand sanitizer when they forced their way into a staff office at the facility, holding weapons to the guards’ throats and demanding their keys.</p>
      <p>People living in the area of the psychiatric centre, located in the 2500 block of Central Avenue, were advised to lock their vehicles, homes and outbuildings and were reminded to remove any spare keys left in vehicles.</p>
      <p>Anyone who believes they may have spotted Michel or who might have information on his whereabouts, is asked to contact Saskatoon police at 306-975-8300 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.</p>
