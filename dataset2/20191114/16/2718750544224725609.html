      <p>How can any film top the iconic <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6xy5q7">David Hasselhoff cameo</a> as a human speedboat-man in 2004’s <i>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</i>? Easy. That first film used Hasselhoff to send up and camp-ify the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PdAeOOtWl4">inherent goofiness of traditional ideas of masculinity</a>. So 2020’s <i>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run </i>trailer features the perfect follow-up, the beloved poster man for sensitive <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/NeoTheMatrix.jpg/220px-NeoTheMatrix.jpg">Neo</a>-Masculinity: Keanu Reeves. More specifically, Keanu Reeves’s head, floating in a tumbleweed. Why are sea creatures SpongeBob and Patrick in the middle of a Wild West town, talking to some sagebrush, you ask? According to the trailer, they’re on the hunt for SpongeBob’s pet snail, Gary, who’s gone missing. <i>SpongeBob</i> purists (my people!) will note that this is a darn near-identical plot to the season-four episode-three special double episode, “Have You Seen This Snail?” but we’ll just glide past that. This film already seems worth it for a floating Keanu-head saying, “I’m made out of sage and I am a sage,” with a twinkle in his eye. Even though this movie isn’t out until May 2020, we’re already bracing ourselves for too much cross promo in the upcoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/live-little-mermaid-and-spongebob-musicals-to-premiere.html"><i>The SpongeBob Musical: Live on Stage!</i></a><i> </i>event on Nickelodeon. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/little-mermaid-live-best-worst-moments.html">We’ve been burned before</a>.</p>
