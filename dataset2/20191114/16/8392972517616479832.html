      <p>Oti Mabuse has admitted she "feared" for her life after a lift went wrong in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> rehearsals with Kelvin Fletcher.</p>
      <p>The pair have been practising their jive to Jailhouse Rock from Smokey Joe's Cafe this week ahead of this weekend's show.</p>
      <p>However, during an appearance on Strictly: It Takes Two on Wednesday night, the pair spoke about their Salsa performance last weekend and Oti revealed she was left "flying across the room" during rehearsals.</p>

      <p>Oti said: "At this point of the competition, we're all trying to push each other. So when you get lifts, you're like, 'how can I make these lifts scary and impossible?'</p>
      <p>"[Kelvin] just kept getting better and better. But after [the dance] I thought, 'what was I thinking?'"</p>
      <aside>On Wednesday, he gets faster and I almost fly across the room.</aside>
      <p>Host Zoe Ball asked: "You simplified it a little bit for the show. Were you in fear of your life?"</p>
      <p>Oti replied: "I was! Every week Kelvin starts slow, but then he progresses incredibly.</p>
      <p>"So when we were doing it, I thought 'you have your hands up and I'll have my hands up'. On Wednesday, he gets faster and I almost fly across the room.</p>

      <p>"I was like, 'oh my god, don't let me go!'"</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, professional dancer Oti hit back at claims Strictly judge Shirley Ballas made her cry after she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictlys-oti-mabuse-in-tears-after-shirley-ballas-criticism/">said there was "a little bit too much rise and fall" in their performance</a>.</p>
      <p>Shirley, 59, told the pair after their routine: "There's very minimal rise and fall in the Viennese Waltz, and there's just a little bit too much rise and fall for me.</p>
      <p>"Also the fleckerl that you chose to dance, and if you choose to dance it, it's a rotary figure that should actually have more power, and it looked a little bit stuck, for me.</p>
      <p>"Although I totally enjoyed the emotive part and I give you 100% for that, also I want to take into account the other one minute and 25 seconds that you're dancing. But otherwise, I thought you did a grand job."</p>

      </p>
      <p>After viewers slammed Shirley for her criticism, Oti cleared things up on Twitter.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Just to be clear. Nothing @ShirleyBallas said to us was wrong nor did it make me tear, she was being honest and her critique is valuable to our journey.</p>
      <p>"I’d like us to improve &amp; as I stated before I was emotional about THE DANCE &amp; how happy dancing made me feel (HAPPY TEARS)."</p>
