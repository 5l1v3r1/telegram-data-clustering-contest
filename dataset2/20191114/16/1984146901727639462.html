      <p>We're calling it now, we reckon we have stumbled across the best festive food combination out there this year and we should now as we've actually tried it!</p>
      <p>Give a round of applause to Costa who have united two winter warmers together to make a dream dish that returns to its festive menu after proving massively popular last year.</p>
      <p>The famous coffee chain, with plenty of branches in the Newcastle area, is once again selling, wait for it....pigs in blankets mac n cheese.</p>
      <p>Yes, you heard that right, macaroni cheese with the added bonus of pigs in blankets, which are of course the best part of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> dinner!</p>
      <p>Priced from £3.40, customers have been going mad for the combination of macaroni pasta with a cheese sauce, Cumberland pork sausage, mature Cheddar cheese, sweetcure bacon, spinach topped with a parsley crumb.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Costa told Chronicle Live: "We’ve had SO MUCH love for this product – it’s one of our best sellers and is flying off the shelves."</p>
      <p>For journalistic purposes only of course, we called into the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/eldon-square">Eldon Square</a> branch of Costa on a wet and miserable Thursday afternoon in Newcastle and as well as being a perfect winter warmer, we can confirm the pigs in blankets mac n cheese was absolutely delicious!</p>
