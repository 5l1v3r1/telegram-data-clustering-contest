      <h1>'What-if scenario' - Club chief gives update on plan for Aston Villa transfer target</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes Rangers' sporting director confirming Alfredo Morelos plan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:23:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:23</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>There are ‘ongoing’ conversations to ensure that Rangers have a ready-made replacement for Alfredo Morelos when the Aston Villa-linked striker leaves the club.</p>
      <p>Morelos, 23, has been touted for a move to the Premier League and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> are said to be among his admirers.</p>
      <p>Just four months after his first appearance of the season in the qualifying stages of the Europa League, Morelos has already scored 22 goals.</p>
      <p>Rangers are keen to ensure the Colombian stays beyond the January window – as boss Steven Gerrard has already confirmed – but sporting director Ross Wilson revealed a plan is being drawn up for when the times comes to sell.</p>

      <p>“That’s a conversation that’s ongoing with the scouts all the time,” Wilson told <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/rangers/alfredo-morelos-looks-like-he-could-play-in-any-league-but-we-are-not-planning-on-selling-rangers-sporting-director-ross-wilson-1-5045557">the Scotsman.</a></p>
      <p>“One of the aims of the scouting and recruitment department is to make sure that in every position we always have a strong list of where we might go in a ‘what-if’ scenario. That’s something we’ve got and it’s something that will build and evolve and develop all the time.</p>
      <p>“The scouting network here has started to be developed strongly across the last couple of years and I’ve had a lot of chats with head of scouting Andy Scoulding as to how we continue to develop that.</p>
      <p>“The task is to make that scouting structure bigger and more robust, tap into the networks we’ve all got inside the club, to find as many opportunities as we can, whether that’s from England, Scotland or into Europe.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Morelos has also been linked with Leicester City and Crystal Palace, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alfredo-morelos-rangers-transfer-news-17253675">although talk of a move to the King Power Stadium was quashed by reports in Scotland.</a></p>
      <p>Wilson added: "We want our best players to stay here as long as they possibly can.</p>
      <p>"We understand that like every other club in world football that there comes a point when players have to move on to something else for a variety of reasons."</p>
