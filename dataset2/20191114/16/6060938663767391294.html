      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IndiGo">IndiGo</a> has been facing headwinds with constant snags on Pratt &amp; Whitney engines that power its mainstay of Airbus A320/21 Neos. The airline has a stiff regulatory deadline to change over 100 of these engines in 3 months or ground the Neos that still have the older, more snag-prone versions of the same. Amid this turbulence, it has been witnessing a major dispute between its founder-promoter groups of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rahul-Bhatia">Rahul Bhatia</a> and Rakesh Gangwal that has now moved to courts in UK and US. And this July-September quarter saw the airline, so far India’s only profitable one, lose Rs 1,062 crore. IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta had a freewheeling conversation with TOI’s Saurabh Sinha where he spoke on each of these challenges and more. Excerpts…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. How has the long-running dispute between the promoters affected the airline?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. Our airline’s mission is to be a great transport company connecting all parts of India and that is shared by everyone, employees and the board. We ordered planes, engines recently and are growing rapidly (after the dispute became public). There was a time when the company as involved when the issue was of related party transactions (RPT) which has now been resolved with the new board-approved RPT.</p>
      <p>Now the disagreement does not involve the running of the company in any way. To the best of my knowledge, the Bhatia and Gangwal groups have appointed an arbitrator each and they haven’t gone to the next step (of these two arbitrators choosing a third arbitrator after which the process begin). We are a professionally-run company with a strong board that runs the business. I give credit to Bhatia and Gangwal: they have stepped back and told us, ‘run the business’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. Will IndiGo be able to meet January 31, 2019, DGCA deadline for changing over 100 Pratt engines for Neos?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. We have two deadlines. By November 19, an engine each on 23 A320 Neos has to be changed and we are pretty sure to achieve that on all or 22 of them. The January 31 deadline is a little more challenging. But both PW and Airbus are working very hard with us to achieve that too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. As suggested by the DGCA, are you looking at deferring future deliveries of Neos to ensure all Neos in your fleet currently get the required replacement engines?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. No. We want the deliveries to keep coming off the aircraft. Engine itself we are looking at both PW and CFM to help.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. Do you feel fares being charged by airlines today are reflected of cost?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. Many industries operate on cost plus basis. They are the fortunate souls of the world. We are not so fortunate. Cost has no relevance to fares. Zero. This is a very price-sensitive market. Empty seats are a perishable commodity and very expensive. Our goal is to have over 80% load factor. We look at our booking at the beginning of month. If it is 50%, we don’t touch fares. If it is above 50%, we raise fares. And if it is below 50%, we put in a sale. No one has pricing power.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. The economy is slowing down. What impact are you seeing on airline industry?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. This Dussehra and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Diwali">Diwali</a> the demand was below our forecast. This October there was softness in demand. We don’t see this continuing. We see softness in economy but we are not in a recession, nowhere close to that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. Your Q2 Rs 1,000 crore plus loss was a shocker ...</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. There were two cost temporary spikes which hit us and the changing accounting standards. Typically an airline will have 7% pilots under training and we have 15% (as it had a big influx of ex-Jet pilots). We have 600 pilots under training who are yet to start flying but are paid. This goes away next June. Then the older A320 classic engines are hitting shop visits that has spiked costs. Then there was mark-to-market (exchange rate) that affected everyone, including us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q. Will you be bidding for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Air-India">Air India</a>?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A. No comments on that.</p>
