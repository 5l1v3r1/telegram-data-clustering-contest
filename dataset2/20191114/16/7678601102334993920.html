      <h1>Pelindo II subsidiary eyes Patimban Port</h1>

      <p>PT Indonesia Kendaraan Terminal (IPCC), a subsidiary of state-owned port operator PT Pelabuhan Indonesia II (Pelindo II), said it hopes the government will appoint it to be the operator of the Patimban Port, although the government has said it plans to name a private company to operate the port in Subang, West Java.</p>
      <p>Salusra Wijaya, IPCC’s acting president director, said in Jakarta on Thursday that the company had formally asked the transportation minister for permission to take part in the bidding to become the operator of the port, which is to be a large vehicle terminal for both exports and imports.</p>
      <p> "So far, so good and we are confident that with our experience and expertise, as well as the availability of funds, we will be ready to manage the Patimban Port," he was quoted as saying by Kontan.</p>
      <p>IPCC, which operates Indonesia’s largest vehicle terminal in the Tanjung Priok Port, is among the largest vehicle terminal operators in Southeast Asia.  </p>
      <p>Salursa said the company would cooperate with car producers such as Hino and Nissan to run the vehcile terminal, which is about 70 kilometers from the Karawang Industrial Estate in West Java, where many Japanese automotive companies have built factories.</p>
      <p>Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Pandjaitan has said the government would hand over the operation and management of the Patimban Port to a private company.</p>
      <p>The minister said in Jakarta on June 24 that the Patimban would compete with the Tanjung Priok Port in North Jakarta, which is managed and operated by Pelindo II.</p>
      <p>The port is being built by a consortium of five companies: Japan's Penta-Ocean Construction, TOA Corporation, Rinkai Nissan Construction and state-owned construction companies PT Wijaya Karya and PT Pembangunan Perumahan.</p>
      <p>The development of the Rp 43.2 trillion (US$3.08 billion) Patimban Port is to be implemented in three stages until 2027. The port is to be able to handle containers of 3.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) when the first stage is completed in 2020. Its capacity will be expanded to 5.5 million TEUs in the second stage and then to 7.5 million TEUs in the final stage. (hen)</p>
