      <p><b>British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd</b> today slammed the Ministry of Health (MoH) for carrying out selective prosecution of a legitimate tobacco company selling legal non-cigarette products while turning a blind eye to cheap illegal contraband.

For the nine-month period, Gas Malaysia's net profit rose 7.22% to RM138.8 million from RM129.46 million last year, while revenue grew 15.87% to RM5.21 billion from RM4.49 billion.</p>
