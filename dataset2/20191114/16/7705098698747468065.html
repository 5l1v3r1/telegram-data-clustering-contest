      <h1>Star Wars’ Daisy Ridley Describes The Rise of Skywalker in 4 Words</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:57:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>Brace yourselves: the last installment in the <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> </b>original saga will likely provoke very different emotions. Or at least that’s what<b> </b>star Daisy Ridley teased about <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a> </b>in her latest interview with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/14/daisy-ridley-rise-of-skywalker-dark-scary/">Entertainment Weekly</a>. The British actress was asked to describe the story in 3 words, but she eventually chose to use 4.</p>
      <p>“Definitely dark….” Ridley said. “There are bits that are genuinely scary. And sad. And joyful.”</p>

      <p>The third film of the new trilogy will probably be Ridley’s last time as Rey. In <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29687060/daisy-ridley-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-interview/">Marie Claire</a>‘s holiday issue, the actress confessed that has no regrets, though, highlighting once again how many different scenarios she had to go through.</p>
      <p>“The third one for me was the best,” she added. “It’s a big film for everyone. I did all of the emotions: I did frowns, I did smiles, it was the sort of biggest breadth, and I think that’s also why I had such a good time, because I got to do so much [stuff]—like, physically, emotionally—and I got to work with so many people.”</p>
      <p>Since a lot of details are still under wraps, we can only guess what she is referring to when she speaks about the story. One thing is for sure: there is a lot of hype surrounding <b>The Rise of Skywalker</b>, and Disney has likely done all they can to cook the story to perfection so as not to leave a bad taste in <b>Star Wars </b>fans’ mouth.</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b> will hit theaters on December 20. What do you think Daisy Ridley is referring to when she speaks about the “genuinely scary” bits? Let us know your guess in the comments section below.</p>
