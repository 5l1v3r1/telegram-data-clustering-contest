      <h1>IG Model Eliza Reign Fights Future For Her Right To Speak In Paternity Drama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:01:08+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">AllHipHop Staff</a></address>
      <p>Future's paternity drama with an Instagram model he claims is trying to extort him continues to unfold in family court.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>A woman seeking to have rapper Future formally identified as the father of her child is fighting the star's request for a gag order.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/ig-model-eliza-reign-says-rapper-future-stopped-contacting-her-after-he-fathered-child-Vunhq-Oji0mjii20s44TdQ/">Eliza Seraphin filed paternity papers in Broward County, Florida over the summer, asking for the "Mask Off" hitmaker to officially be recognized as the father of her child.</a>
      </p>
      <p>She's also asking the rapper be ordered to pay retroactive child support and cover her hospital expenses from her daughter's birth in April.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/future-marches-into-court-to-shut-up-alleged-baby-mama-D-e0QInj5kOKIj7ClCttPw/">Future, real name Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, fired back at Seraphin, also known as Eliza Reign, accusing her of attempting to "extort" money from him because he is rich.</a>
      </p>
      <p>He also demanding she be prohibited from talking about him or discussing the case in public.</p>
      <p>Now Seraphin has responded to the hip-hop star's effort to silence her, calling on the judge overseeing the case to rule in her favor and also order Future to pay her legal fees, <a href="https://theblast.com/c/rapper-future-baby-mama-Eliza-Reign-court-gag-order-florida-paternity-baby-lawsuit-joie-chavis">reports The Blast.</a></p>
      <p>The rapper is refusing to acknowledge Seraphin's daughter, Reign, as his own, recently using social media to make it clear he only has five "wives," including his ex-fiancee Ciara, the mother of his five-year-old son Future Zahir.</p>
      <p>Soon after the lawsuit was filed, he wrote, "I have 5 wives BTW (by the way). Love them all to death."</p>
      <p>Seraphin isn't the only woman taking Future to court over paternity - Cindy Renae Parker lodged a similar suit in Texas last month, claiming he is the father of her son Legend, who was born in July.</p>
