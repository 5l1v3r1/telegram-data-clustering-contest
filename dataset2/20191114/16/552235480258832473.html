      <p>A man who was attacked by his own <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dangerous-dog">dog</a> ended up in the dock.</p>
      <p>Allan Forsyth, 30 was pounced upon by Bronson his Johnson American Bulldog in April this year, and suffered multiple bites to his body and calf.</p>
      <p>He was charged under the dangerous dogs act of being the owner of the dog which attacked him to his severe injury at his home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Rutherglen</a> , near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> .</p>
      <p>Forsyth today admitted the charge which could result in Bronson being put down.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alan Findlay has ordered a report on Bronson by an animal expert to see if it is a danger to the public.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that Bronson mauled Forsyth after he allegedly annoyed it in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>The court heard police were contacted at 2.45am by Forysth’s partner.</p>
      <p>When they arrived they found four dogs outside of the house and Forysth on the couch with “significant” leg and arm injuries.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Louise McNeill said: “Officers were told by Forsyth’s partner that he had been drinking and was antagonising the dog.</p>
      <p>“She said Bronson lashed out and bit him several times repeatedly on the body.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The court heard that one of the other dogs saved Forsyth from more serious injury by attacking Bronson.</p>
      <p>Ms McNeill added: “One of the female dogs began to attack Bronson which caused him to lose his grip.”</p>
      <p>All four dogs were taken to police kennels by the officers where they have remained since the incident.</p>
      <p>It is open to the sheriff to have Bronson destroyed for the attack.</p>
      <p>However, Sheriff Findlay replied: “It seems a bit unfair on Bronson if he has been harassed.”</p>
      <p>He deferred sentence on Forsyth for background reports and a report on Bronson.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Findlay will also determine whether Forsyth should be from owning animals.</p>
      <p>Forsyth, now of Cambuslang, has been bailed meantime.</p>
