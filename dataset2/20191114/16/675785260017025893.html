      <h1>Pep Guardiola writes to 114 Man City fans and offers them VIP tickets to Shakhtar tie</h1>
      <h2>The fans made the long trip to watch City in Ukraine and have been rewarded for their support with a night of entertainment in the club's hospitality suites</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:58:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> has personally invited 114 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> fans for a VIP hospitality experience at their Champions League clash with Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
      <p>The City boss signed letters to each fan, whom had all travelled to the Ukraine for the away Group C fixture in mid-September.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's note thanked them for their 'dedicated support', as well as details of the reward for the match on November 26.</p>
      <p>Those that made the 4,000-mile round trip will now be the beneficiaries of one of City's high end hospitality packages, which are priced at anything from £359.</p>
      <p>City fan Darren Page shared a picture of his letter on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , along with the message: "Thanks Pep and @ManCity."</p>
      <p>The letter read: "Dear Darren, on Wednesday 18th September you and 113 other dedicated supporters made the long trip to watch us play against Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine, and I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you.</p>
      <p>"We were so pleased to start our Champions League campaign with a victory. We faced a tough Shakhtar team but I felt that we played well, controlled the game and deserved to win.</p>
      <p>"To have your support in these games means so much, and as I have always said, we are nothing without our fans."</p>

      <p>It was penned by Guardiola himself, who added: "'As a gesture of our thanks, we would like to invite you to a City hospitality experience at the return fixture vs Shakhtar Donetsk on 26th November 2019.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of the players and the staff, I would like to thank you again for your incredible support. Pep Guardiola."</p>
      <p>All recipients of the letter are now set for a nights entertainment on behalf of the club.</p>

      <p>City's top Tunnel Club VVIP package costs £12,000 for 10 people, and includes heated and padded seats behind the team dugouts, five-course fine dining; and unlimited drinks in a private booth.</p>
      <p>It also boasts a "world-first in football" view at players when they line up in the tunnel through a glass window.</p>
      <p>The Tunnel Club Premier package offers the same perks, minus the private booth, for £600 per person.</p>
      <p>Or the fans could be treated to a night in the Chairman's Club, which sees them join directors and celebrities in a box on the half-way line, complete with the five-course meal, all for £359 each.</p>
      <p>And the game itself is still of large importance for City, whom can seal their progression to the knockout stage with a win over Shakhtar.</p>
      <p>They are currently top on 10 points - five clear of the Ukrainian outfit - with Dinamo Zagreb joint second in the table, and Atalanta bottom on just one point.</p>
