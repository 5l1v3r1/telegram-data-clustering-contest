      <h1>Renowned musicians find their way back to Saskatoon for SSO Homecoming</h1>

      <p>The SSO Homecoming concert features Carissa Klopoushak, Ryan Cole, and William Rowson — all professionals who got their start in Saskatoon.</p>
      <h3>They’ve travelled far, but <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/music/review-sso-aims-for-the-stars-with-creative-rendition-of-the-planets">the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra</a> is welcoming back some alumni that call Saskatoon their hometown.</h3>
      <p>“You can never take the prairie girl out of the prairie girl,” Violinist Carissa Klopoushak said.</p>
      <p>Klopoushak, trumpet player Ryan Cole and conductor William Rowson are back in the city for the SSO’s Homecoming concert on Nov. 16. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/music/1107-you-saskatunes-classical">All three musicians grew up in Saskatoon and got their start playing in the city</a> — each was a member of the Saskatoon Youth Orchestra for a time — and they’ve gone their separate ways nationally and internationally.</p>
      <p>Klopoushak now plays with the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa. Cole is the principal trumpet for the Victoria Symphony, and Rowson is listed as an assistant conductor for the Vancouver Symphony.</p>
      <p>As Rowson puts it, Saskatoon remains a fondly-remembered home regardless of where these talented performers have ended up.</p>
      <p>“If you go off to prestigious schools elsewhere and study with very famous people in big cities, I always filter things through the first experiences I had playing — which were with the SYO,” he said.</p>

      <p>The Homecoming concert with the SSO will feature a pair of better-known works in Franz Schubert’s Symphony No. 8, “Unfinished,” and selections from Antonin Dvorak’s Slavic Dances, as well as a pair of concertos to be performed by Klopoushak and Cole: Canadian composer Vivian Fung’s Violin Concerto No. 1, and Marcus Goddard’s Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra — a piece written specifically for Cole.</p>
      <p>“This piece was written for me and premièred by me, and now I get to take it home and say … this piece is for me, and I can show everyone,” he said.</p>
      <p>Cole said his first memory of the broad classical music genre was as a child watching the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra with his family — an experience Rowson echoed. And Cole has never played with the SSO as a guest artist before now.</p>
      <p>So to be returning home to the place he learned to play the instrument that’s helped define his life, to play a piece written just for him, is a unique experience.</p>
      <p>“For me, I hope someone out there … can sort of see that if they want to do something, they can do it,” he said. “It’s sharing that experience with someone else. It’s not about just me, it’s for them.”</p>
      <p>Rowson, who will be the guest conductor for the entire concert, said he loves coming back to Saskatchewan with his kids to visit his parents on their farm. Being able to bring some music with him this time is a big added bonus.</p>
      <p>“To walk out on the stage and see everything from the other side, I always have to stop for a minute and take everything in,” Rowson said. “I always peek out around the corner and see where our family used to sit, where our tickets were.”</p>
      <p>While the performers still find their way back to Saskatoon when they can — Klopoushak, for instance, helps run the Ritornello Chamber Music Festival — it’s always a little different when they’re performing for friends and family.</p>
      <p>“The idea of coming back and playing in Saskatoon … it’s a part of my career I’ve tried to make as regular as possible,” Klopoushak said. “I love that community. I miss the city.”</p>
