      <h1>Another Coaching Casualty On The Horizon?</h1>

      <p>It looks like another coach could be on his way out of a Premier Soccer League club this season. </p>
      <p>Following an unimpressive start of three wins from 11 matches thus far during this campaign, the indication is that Cape Umoya United could be making coaching changes for the restart of their GladAfrica Championship campaign after the FIFA international break, with sources indicating that Dominic Isaacs could be relieved of his duties. </p>

      <p>Isaacs was appointed as the Mother City club’s coach in November last year, replacing veteran coach Roger de Sa, who had been in charge of the team. </p>
      <p>Umoya were at the bottom of the NFD log with only two wins from 12 games at the time of Isaac’s appointment. </p>
      <p>“I think it’s better if you call the club management and ask them,” Isaacs told the Siya crew about the latest developments at Umoya.</p>

      <p>“They haven’t officially served me with any papers. So, I can’t confirm anything,” the former Kaizer Chiefs defender added. </p>
      <p>Asked if he had been in charge of the team's training sessions this week, Isaacs responded, “I didn’t train the team yesterday (Wednesday) (and) I didn’t train them today. I don’t want to make a comment on whatever. I cannot deny or confirm, I think it’s better if you call the club.”</p>
      <p>The Siya crew has learnt from sources close to the club that Maahier Davids, the brother of Orlando Pirates assistant coach Fadlu Davids; as well as veteran coach Johnny Ferreira have emerged as early candidates for Umoya’s coaching position, should Isaacs’ exit from the club be confirmed.      </p>
