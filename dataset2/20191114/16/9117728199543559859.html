        <b>In 2001, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a> and Fernando Alonso were just starting their Formula 1 journeys. Juan Pablo Montoya was another driver starting out and he had a lot of attention on his back. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> was the third race of the season back then. </b>

      <p>Montoya, who was racing for Williams alongside Ralf Schumacher, was leading the race after catching up with then-champion Michael Schumacher. This was until Jos Verstappen caused some issues. </p>

      <p>Verstappen hit Montoya's Williams car and knocked him out of the race. Verstappen took the blame for the incident after the race. This was not the only time in that season when a car drove into the back of a Williams. Rubens Barrichello had torpedoed Ralf Schumacher in the same race. </p>
