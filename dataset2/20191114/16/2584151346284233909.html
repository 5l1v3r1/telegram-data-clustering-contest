      <h1>Romania’s Commission candidate gets MEPs’ backing</h1>
      <h2>Adina-Ioana Vălean approved after original candidate Rovana Plumb rejected.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:13:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Hanne Cokelaere, Maïa de La Baume</a></address>
      <p>Romania’s candidate for commissioner, Adina-Ioana Vălean, was today given the green light by MEPs in the European Parliament's Transport and Tourism Committee.</p>
      <p>A majority of committee coordinators gave their approval to Vălean after a near three-hour session, two officials confirmed to POLITICO.</p>
      <p>The far-right Identity and Democracy was the only group to oppose Vălean’s confirmation, while the Greens said they wanted her to provide additional information.</p>
      <p>The approval means Vălean can take up a role as commissioner in Ursula von der Leyen's Commission subject to final approval by the European Parliament plenary.</p>
      <p>The decision came despite a patchy performance during the hearing, in which Vălean acknowledged several times she did not have details of the policy areas at hand.</p>
      <p>She took questions on a range of topics including a future aviation tax, plans to decarbonize the maritime sector and how far she would go to back the bloc's railways as a clean mode of transport.</p>
