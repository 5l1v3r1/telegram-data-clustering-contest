      <h1>Ledger Vault Secures $150 Million Crime Insurance Policy for Digital Assets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:28:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:28</time> by <a rel="author">Ana Alexandre</a></address>
      <p>Ledger Vault, the custody arm of hardware <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/abra-adding-60-new-cryptocurrencies-in-consumer-adoption-push-report">wallet</a> manufacturer Ledger, has procured a crime insurance policy developed with broker and risk advisory firm Marsh and insurance company Arch Insurance Limited.</p>
      <p>According to an announcement on Nov. 14, the Ledger Vault platform now provides its users a customized <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-man-arrested-for-unregistered-crypto-transactions">crime</a> insurance program for cryptocurrencies for up to $150 million. The program applies to third-party theft of the master seed and private keys, secure transmissions of the master seed fragments, and insider Ledger employee theft caused by collusion.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the new offering, Demetrios Skalkotos, global head of Ledger Vault, explained: </p>
      <blockquote>“The policy also covers the clients’ onboarding process, their personal security devices and the secure encrypted communication channel that is established when using the Vault platform. This unique policy is a true end-to-end solution that gives our customers the flexibility to both store and move funds without compromising on security and governance.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Insurance offerings for crypto grow</h3>
      <p>As more money enters the cryptocurrency sector, investors are looking to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-insurance-a-promising-sector-despite-caution-of-major-players">digital asset insurance</a> policies in order to cover losses due to possible thefts or accidents.</p>
      <p>Indeed security research firm CipherTrace has previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cyber-criminals-netted-43b-from-crypto-related-crime-in-2019-study">estimated</a> that more than $4 billion worth of cryptocurrency was lost through theft and fraud in 2019.</p>
      <p>Cardiff-based cryptocurrency insurance startup Coincover launched a cryptocurrency insurance offering in September. Coincover reportedly monitors the wallet at all times and issues warnings if it observes suspicious activity. </p>
      <h3>Ledger Vault’s tech is adopted at other institutions</h3>
      <p>Previously, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-rokkex-incorporates-ledger-vault-to-improve-security">reported</a> that Estonia-based crypto exchange Rokkex integrated its trading platform with Ledger Vault to secure its crypto assets.</p>
      <p>In May, news broke that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/canadas-largest-bank-mulls-crypto-exchange-after-bitcoin-ban-report">Canadian</a> cryptocurrency broker Voyager Digital planned to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-custody-firm-ledger-vault-to-provide-services-to-crypto-broker-voyager-digital">integrate</a> Ledger Vault’s multi-authorization cryptocurrency wallet management system into its trading platform with the aim to increase its overall cybersecurity.</p>
