      <p>If <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/575331/daylight-saving-time-effects">Daylight Saving Time</a>'s cruel theft of those precious autumn sunlight hours is making you crave more caffeine than usual, you’re in luck: Starbucks is blessing us with a buy-one-get-one-free deal this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Thrillist <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/starbucks-happy-hour-november-2019-bogo-handcrafted-drinks">reports</a> that you can claim your free drink with the purchase of any handcrafted coffee beverage, grande-sized or larger, between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m today. You’ll have to download the Starbucks app in order to access the deal, but you don’t have to be a member of the rewards program. If you’re planning on nabbing your two coffees today, however, now might be a good time to register—it’s free, and you’ll earn stars on your purchase that’ll count towards another eventual free beverage or food item.</p>
      <p>Though <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64991/14-freshly-brewed-facts-about-starbucks">Starbucks</a> holds these “Happy Hour” opportunities every so often, the deals themselves vary. Sometimes, for example, all handcrafted beverages are half off, and other times the offer only applies to blended Frappuccino beverages.</p>
      <p>According to the terms listed in the app, today’s BOGO bargain doesn’t include regular hot coffee, hot tea, ready-to-drink beverages (like juices or other bottled drinks), or Starbucks Reserve drinks.</p>
      <p>It does, however, include the internationally esteemed <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/68212/what-pumpkin-spice">pumpkin spice</a> latte, as well as the recently returned lineup of irresistible <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2019/starbucks-rings-in-the-holidays-with-fan-favorites/">holiday drinks</a>: peppermint mocha, toasted white chocolate mocha, caramel brulée latte, chestnut praline latte, and eggnog latte.</p>

      <p>If you happen to have a child in tow (or you’re just not hooked on caffeine), <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72909/13-things-you-might-not-know-about-hot-chocolate">hot chocolate</a> makes an ideal after-school treat, and Starbucks has an impressive five flavors to choose from: traditional, peppermint, toasted white chocolate, regular white chocolate, and salted caramel.</p>
      <p>And when you do visit the café today or any other day, remember to be kind to the barista … or else they might swap out your drink for a decaffeinated one. Here are 11 other <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/578283/starbucks-employee-secrets">secrets</a> from Starbucks employees.</p>
