      <p>As one of South Africa’s successful exports to European shores, Nasief Morris has rubbed shoulders with some of the biggest names in world football.</p>
      <p>When it came to his cars, the defender was no slouch either and boasted a host of multimillion-rand cars, which included a venomous Maserati.</p>

      <p>As if that were not impressive enough, the 38-year-old boasted a Range Rover Sport as well as the beat that is the Mercedes Benz C63, which Morris referred to as “his toy”</p>
      <p>In an episode of SLTV in 2016, the former Panathanaikos defender gave fans a rare view at his luxurious collection.</p>
      <p>Though it is unclear whether Morris still has any of his rides, his collection will certainly go down as one of Mzansi’s finest.</p>
