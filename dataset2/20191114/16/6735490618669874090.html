      <p>“Just came back to say; after months of seeing every person of color they could think of for the role of Prince Eric, @DisneyStudios somehow still cast a white guy,” he tweeted. “I guess diversity is just a word. And THAT’S Hollywood. One brown person is enough, two brown leads [are] unthinkable.”</p>
      <p>The tweet is not presently available to see. Navarro had made a brief comeback to Twitter to share his thoughts before again deleting his account.</p>

      <p>“Literally, @Disney saw a who’s who list of actors of colour and STILL went with the white guy,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/_alexismiguel/status/1194688260838232065?s=20">wrote</a> separately on his Instagram Stories. “So much for diversity. I guess two brown leads would have tanked the movie right? Boring.”</p>
      <p>The new “Little Mermaid” film stars Halle Bailey, Jacob Tremblay, Awkwafina and more.</p>
