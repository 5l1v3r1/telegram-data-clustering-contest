      <p>Sun City - <b>Louis Oosthuizen</b> had to fight kidney stones the morning prior to the opening round of the <b>Nedbank Golf Challenge</b> as he fired to the top of the leaderboard at Sun City on Thursday.</p>
      <p>SA's top ranked golfer carded a superb opening round of<b> 63</b>, <b>nine shots under par</b>, to take a <b>three-shot</b> lead into Friday.</p>

      <p>Oosthuizen confessed that he almost did not play as he battled with kidney stones which resulted in treatment in Rustenburg on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The whole of yesterday, I spent my time in the hospital in Rustenburg. At 3am, I was on my knees next to the toilet. I really thought I wasn't going to tee off this morning, I thought it was going to be a horrible week for me," Oosthuizen told reporters after his round on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I slowed everything down, it (the pain) wasn't that bad, it got better during the round... I'm very chuffed with the round."</p>
      <p>Oosthuizen has had success before at the Gary Player Country Club as the then young Mossel Bay-born golfer claimed the Dimension Data Pro-Am in 2007.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old admitted that being back in Sun City had brought back good memories and helped his stellar bogey-free round.</p>
      <p>"I just love the golf course, my first win on the Sunshine Tour was on this course at the Dimension Data. Every time I play here, it brings back good memories," said Oosthuizen.</p>
      <p>Oosthuizen hopes to repeat his performance again in Round 2.</p>
      <p>"I'm hoping for a pretty similar thing tomorrow gameplay wise, just try and get as many birdie opportunities as I can," he said.</p>
      <p>Thomas Detry is Oosthuizen's nearest rival, as the Belgian golfer carded a 6-under 66.</p>
      <p>South African's <b>Ernie Els</b> and <b>Zander Lombard</b> sit T4 alongside defending champion Lee Westwood on 4-under 68.</p>
