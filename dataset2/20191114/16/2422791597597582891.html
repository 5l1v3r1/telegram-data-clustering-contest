      <p>SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Several people were injured Thursday during a shooting at a Southern California high school and the gunman was in custody, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Reports on the number of people injured have fluctuated.</p>
      <p>Fire officials said at least three people were injured.</p>
      <p>However, a hospital in the city of Santa Clarita tweeted that it received two patients in critical condition and three more were on the way.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said deputies responded to Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles (48 kilometres) northwest of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told KNX radio the suspect in a school shooting was in custody.</p>
      <p>Television images showed deputies swarming the school and several people being moved on gurneys.</p>
      <p>Lines of students were escorted from the school by armed deputies.</p>
      <p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said President Donald Trump was monitoring the reports.</p>
      <p>There were three confirmed patients with injuries, and it was not immediately clear if they were gunshot wounds or other types of injuries, fire spokesman Christopher Thomas said.</p>
      <p>Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in the city of Santa Clarita tweeted that it received two patients in critical condition and three more were on the way.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles County sheriff's Santa Clarita Valley station says there are "reports of approximately five victims being treated."</p>
      <p>Saugus High School and other schools in the area were locked down.</p>
