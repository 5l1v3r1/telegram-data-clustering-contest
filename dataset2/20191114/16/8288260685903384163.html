      <h1>'Let's build momentum' - Table-topping Tamworth FC have one main focus</h1>
      <h2>Tamworth FC are currently two points clear at the top of the Southern Premier Central Division and they entertain Kings Langley at The Lamb on Saturday, kick off 3pm</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:43:43+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Panter</a></address>
      <p>Joint Tamworth boss Gary Smith says his side are fully focused on maintaining their title challenge.</p>
      <p>And he believes their exit from the FA Trophy last weekend, however disappointing, might not be a bad thing as they look to fulfil their ultimate goal.</p>
      <p>The Lambs were humbled 5-3 by Gainsborough Trinity in the Trophy on Saturday, meaning their cup adventures, in the main FA competitions, are over.</p>
      <p>They do still have the Birmingham and Staffs Senior Cups to play for but the priority is very much on the Southern Premier Central and a 2-0 win over Alvechurch on Tuesday night means they are two points clear at the top of the table.</p>

      <p>And Smith said: “We have only really got the league to concentrate on now.</p>
      <p>“There are some clubs in our division who are still in the FA Trophy or FA Cup or even both competitions.</p>
      <p>“Don’t get me wrong, those cups are fantastic and being involved in them gives a great buzz around a club, fantastic hype and involvement brings in revenue.</p>
      <p>"But it can hinder you in terms of the league.</p>
      <p>“We have a chance now to really push on in terms of our league fixtures and build some real momentum.</p>
      <p>“We have the advantage over the winter as well that, with a 4G pitch, we rarely have games called off.</p>
      <p>“So some teams could end up with a fixture backlog and we have a chance to build up some points.”</p>
      <p>Smith admits that won’t be easy though as teams target upsetting the applecart against the team at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>“No-one will make it easy for us,” he said. “But, then again, we won’t make it easy for anyone either!</p>
      <p>“We have told the boys that every game from now until the end of the season will be a cup final for us. We know that, as leaders, everyone will want to knock us off that perch.</p>
      <p>“We’ll stay focused and we can hopefully kick on in the run up to Christmas.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Next up is a home game against Kings Langley on Saturday, kick-off 3pm. The visitors are 15th in the table with five wins from 13 games played.</p>
      <p>“They are a bit of an unknown quantity for us,” Smith said. “We have not played them before but the league has proved anyone can beat anyone.</p>
      <p>“So we will make sure we do our homework correctly, set ourselves up well and look for three points.”</p>
      <p>Skipper Ryan Beswick is expected to be involved again as he continues to manage a foot problem.</p>
      <p>“Bes is an old, wise head and he knows how to manage himself,” added Smith. “You can see the influence he has on the side.</p>
      <p>“He came back in on Tuesday night, along with Jordan Gough and Aaron Forde and all three of them came out and showed what good players they are at this level.”</p>
      <p>Lathaniel Rowe-Turner could return to the side this weekend after missing the clash with Alvechurch due to a family matter.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Dan Creaney says he’s enjoying the battle for the Golden Boot at Tamworth and says it can only bring out the best in the side going forward.</p>
      <p>Creaney notched his ninth goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Alvechurch on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>He’s running neck and neck with skipper Ryan Beswick with Tyrell Waite and Rhys Hoenes a couple of goals further back.</p>
      <p>Jordan Clement, Ahmed Obeng, Bilal Yafai and Greg Kaziboni have also bagged goals this campaign and are capable of pushing on.</p>
      <p>And Creaney said: “It’s just nice to score and help the team.</p>
      <p>“Bes (Ryan Beswick) put it on a plate for me to be fair.</p>
      <p>“An early goal is always the best, it sets you at ease. It puts a bit of confidence in you. You are not as nervous on the ball.</p>
      <p>“I was just gutted not to add to it to be honest. I want to keep pushing the other lads in the scoring stakes!</p>
      <p>“Bes, Tyrell and a few of the other lads are up there in the goals and it’s getting competitive.</p>
      <p>“We are all enjoying the banter and we are trying to out-do each other. I just need to get Beswick off penalties!”</p>

      <p>Creaney felt the win over Alvechurch was comfortable.</p>
      <p>“In the first half, we came out of the blocks flying and it’s good we can do that. We were left chasing the game Saturday (against Trinity) so it was nice to be on the other side of it, 2-0 up early on.</p>
      <p>“The second half was not as great but it’s a Tuesday night and the lads have been at work. We still saw it out well.</p>
      <p>“We have been top of the league for two games now and hopefully we can start to create a little gap. We want to start pushing on.”</p>
