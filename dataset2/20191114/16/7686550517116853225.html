      <h1>Cardiff City and Birmingham City hit with fines following melee</h1>
      <h2>The Midlands club have also been handed a fine worth £7,500</h2>

      <p>Cardiff City have been fined £5,000 for their part in a melee with Birmingham City players.</p>
      <p>A scuffle broke out in injury time during the Bluebirds' 4-2 win over the Blues at Cardiff City Stadium at the start of this month.</p>
      <p>Birmingham have also been fined £7,500.</p>
      <p>The fine comes after both clubs admitted to failing to control their players and while Cardiff accepted the standard penalty, Pep Clotet's side requested a paper hearing.</p>
      <p>The incident-packed clash saw two sendings off as well as six goals, with Danny Ward and Harlee Dean being dismissed for Cardiff and Birmingham respectively.</p>
      <p>Dean's marching orders were given in the 93rd-minute following a hefty collision with hat-trick hero Joe Ralls, which sparked the brief brawl near the halfway line.</p>
      <p>His leading elbow on Ralls preceded a big coming together of both sets of players before referee Andy Madley brandished he red card to Dean.</p>
      <p>Birmingham's appeal to overturn the decision was rejected.</p>
