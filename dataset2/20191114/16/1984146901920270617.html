      <h1>Aston Villa face goalkeeper crisis ahead of Newcastle United visit</h1>
      <h2>Dean Smith's side will be without £8m England keeper and his back-up after double injury blow</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:44:12+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Jamieson</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa will go into their Premier League clash with Newcastle United without their first and second-choice goalkeepers.</p>
      <p>Their £8m signing Tom Heaton was forced to pull out of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England squad</a> this international break after picking up an injury in training ahead of their Midlands derby with Wolves.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Dean Smith's side</a> were then dealt a second blow when his deputy, Jed Steer, was forced off in the 2-1 home defeat to their rivals last weekend with a calf injury.</p>
      <p>With Heaton expected to miss the next couple of weeks, and Steer ruled out until the new year, Villa will turn to Orjan Nyland for the match with United when the Premier League gets back under way.</p>
      <p>Nyland was confident he can stake his claim for a first-team role, however, saying: "It's about being ready when the opportunity arises. They're betting on me to the extent that they want me to be there,"</p>
      <p>"They have clear goals for me, and I think I'm a Premier League keeper."</p>

      <p>Villa are also sweating on the fitness of midfield talisman Jack Grealish. He picked up a knock in a defeat against Manchester City last month, but is closing in on a return.</p>
      <p>Grealish has been a key man for the Premier League new boys, and while <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> fans wouldn't mind if he was missing when the two sides meet, he remains a popular figure among the Toon Army after it was his late goal for Villa against Brighton in 2017 which helped the Magpies land the Championship title.</p>
