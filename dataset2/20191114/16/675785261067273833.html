      <h1>Fabinho delighted with Liverpool nickname handed down by Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <h2>The German manager has come up with a new pet name for the Brazilian midfielder and Fabinho certainly seems to appreciate it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T16:45:30+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool midfielder Fabinho seems to be happy with his new nickname 'Dyson' as the 26-year-old continues to impress for the Reds.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian international has proved to be a superb bit of business for Jurgen Klopp, and he was a big part of the team that helped <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> win the Champions League last season.</p>
      <p>He has also been an ever-present so far during the current campaign, and has been named 'Dyson' due to his constant ability to sweep up in the middle of the pitch, with Klopp comparing him to the popular hoover brand.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his new nickname to <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/372860-fabinhho-on-nicknames-and-improvements">Liverpool's official website</a> , Fabinho said: "A few people call me this! Between us players I'm more known as Flaco but they're cool nicknames.</p>

      <p>"Before the coach used it (Dyson) another player used it- I think James Milner might have said it.</p>
      <p>"It's a cool nickname but the one that the majority of the players use, Flaco, that was started by Virgil van Dijk and everybody started calling me it."</p>
      <p>Although Fabinho is satisfied with his performances since his move from Monaco in 2018, he still feels there is room for improvement, and thinks there is still more to come from him.</p>
      <p>He added: "I wanted this season to be different because I had already adapted to the team and the league. I wanted to keep improving as a player and help the team out more. That's what I've been aiming for.</p>

      <p>"I'm happy for the praise that I've got but I know I still have got the scope to improve and I want to keep improving.</p>
      <p>"There's always scope to improve. I'm still young, I want to improve more, develop more. I've got personal objectives as well, so I've still got more to offer to the team."</p>
      <p>Fabinho has been included in the Brazil squad to take on bitter rivals Argentina on Friday and South Korea on Tuesday.</p>
