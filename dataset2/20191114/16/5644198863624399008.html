      <p>PHNOM PENH: Cambodian leader Hun Sen ordered the release on Thursday (Nov 14) of dozens of opponents and activists that authorities accused of helping his arch-rival plot a coup.</p>
      <p>The arrests were linked to attempts by <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-ordered-cambodia-s-rainsy-barred-from-flight-malaysia-12090994">opposition figurehead Sam Rainsy</a> to return home from France, where he has lived since 2015 to avoid jail for convictions he says are politically motivated.</p>

      <p>Hun Sen had sent out arrest warrants for Rainsy to neighbouring countries ahead of his planned homecoming of Nov 9.</p>
      <p>The Cambodian strongman also beefed up security at the Thai border crossing, and his government has said they will regard Rainsy's return as a "coup attempt".</p>
      <p>"The (coup) plot had ill will, but people did not join it," said Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia since 1985, on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He said more than 70 opposition activists would be released on bail "for the sake of national unity", adding that they had been cheated by Rainsy.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes days after Cambodia lifted house arrest restrictions on <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/cambodian-opposition-leader-kem-sokha-freed-from-house-arrest-12080094">Rainsy's political ally Kem Sokha</a>, the co-founder of the now-dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The dissolution of the CNRP paved the way for Hun Sen to sweep a widely criticised election last year, turning Cambodia into a one-party state.</p>
      <p>As a result, the European Union started a review of a duty-free tariff scheme for the country's lucrative garment sector. Analysts say the possible removal of the deal is a rare weak spot for Hun Sen.</p>
      <p>For now, it remains unclear how Rainsy can return to Cambodia without Hun Sen's say-so.</p>
      <p>He had promised to come home on Saturday, Cambodia's independence day, but was blocked from a Thai Airways flight in Paris. </p>
      <p>He then flew to Malaysia instead, and on to Jakarta on Thursday morning.</p>
