      <p>The market has all been waiting for this: the return of the Moto RAZR. The Moto RAZR clamshell phone from the early 2000s is back. It is an upgraded version although the design is really reminiscent of the original Moto flip phone. The idea of a comeback or that Motorola RAZR foldable phone may be in the works was first heard in January. A foldable phone patent was officially granted and then confirmed. A few months later, Motorola’s first foldable phone was seen on the Bluetooth site.</p>
      <p>The device was said <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/motorolas-first-foldable-phone-seen-on-bluetooth-site-may-arrive-this-2019-20190417/">to arrive this 2019</a>. Soon, more images were <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/motorola-razr-foldable-phone-images-leaked-on-weibo-20190429/">leaked</a>. Lenovo even showed a <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/lenovo-shows-fan-video-to-promote-motorola-razr-without-permission-20190519/">fan video</a> to promote Motorola Razr without permission. Motorola said the <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/motorola-moto-razr-foldable-phone-will-be-out-before-2019-ends-20190930/">foldable phone would be out</a> before 2019 ends. More <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/more-motorola-razr-foldable-phone-live-images-surface-on-the-web-20191103/">live images</a> surfaced on the web and D-Day has finally come. Motorola has <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/motorola-razr-images-surface-once-again-launch-happening-soon-20191101/">officially launched</a> the RAZR as we’ve been expecting to happen today, November 13.</p>
      <p>The<b> Motorola razr</b> is this generation’s stylish flip phone. Remember the time when the original RAZR was all the rage. A lot of people were holding the clamshell phone in their hands all over the world. It was a fashion icon and it’s getting a new lease in life with a better and more advanced design.</p>

      <p>The Motorola RAZR has evolved into a clamshell phone with a flexible display. Believe it or not, the phone folds completely. There is still a hinge but instead of two separate screens, there is only one tall display that offers a larger screen real estate. It was a product of long consumer research and more than 20 prototypes.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/tag/motorola-foldable-phone/">Motorola foldable phone</a> boasts a premium stainless steel casing, 3D Gorilla Glass, and a sleek and slim design. The company has described the patent-protected zero-gap hinge. It protects the display from dust and debris so it won’t be easily damaged. The device is also splash-proof and water-resistant with a special coating. The antennas have been re-engineered to fit a smaller space.</p>
      <p>Specs of the next-gen Motorola RAZR are as follows: 6.2-inch ​Flex View display, 21:9 aspect ratio, external 2.7-inch interactive​ Q​uick View screen, 6GB RAM, 128GB onboard storage, Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 octa-core processor, and a 2510mAh battery with 15W TurboPower charging. There’s also the standard connectivity options like Bluetooth 5.0, WiFi, hotspot, GPS, and GLONASS. When it comes to imaging, there’s nothing spectacular—just a regular 16MP rear cam with f/1.7 aperture, Laser AF, Dual Pixel AF, and dual-LED flash plus a 5MP selfie camera with screen flash.</p>
