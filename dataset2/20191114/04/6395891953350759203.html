      <p>The route presented <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/plans-laid-out-for-hyperloop-route-with-stops-in-pittsburgh/1008268667#">Wednesday</a> is being proposed by Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, which has a test track in France and is working on a passenger system between Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. </p>
      <p>Most of the proposed route between Cleveland and Pittsburgh would be built 6 to 12 feet underground and mostly on public rights of way near highways.</p>
      <p>It would rely on solar energy power and it could move up to 6 million passengers a year. There would be two stations in Pittsburgh -- one downtown and the other at the airport. </p>
      <p>The plan is to get a passenger route up and running in India during the next decade, and a route in the United States will likely <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/plans-laid-out-for-hyperloop-route-with-stops-in-pittsburgh/1008268667#">follow</a> after that. </p>
