      <p>Police in Wiyung sub-district in Surabaya, East Java arrested a 26-year-old man named Erik Dwi Guna Yulianto on Sunday for allegedly filming women in fitting rooms at a mall. </p>
      <p>Erik, who worked as a shopkeeper at a clothing store, was arrested based on a report from one of the victims, who found out that she was being filmed on Sunday. </p>
      <p>“The suspect deliberately put his mobile phone under the fitting rooms. There was an element of deliberate recording while the victims changed clothes,” Wiyung Police Chief M. Rasyad said on Monday, <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-timur/d-4780848/seorang-pria-pelaku-perekaman-di-ruang-pas-sebuah-mal-surabaya-diamankan">as quoted by </a><i><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-timur/d-4780848/seorang-pria-pelaku-perekaman-di-ruang-pas-sebuah-mal-surabaya-diamankan">Detik</a>.</i></p>
      <p>Police said the victim then complained to the store manager but <a href="https://surabaya.kompas.com/read/2019/11/12/16303231/perekam-fitting-room-di-mal-simpan-6-video-konsumen-perempuan-saat-coba-baju">she was ignored</a>. She then filed a report to the mall’s security officers, which resulted in Erik being apprehended and handed over to the police station. </p>
      <p>Rasyad said that his team found six videos of female customers changing inside the fitting rooms in Erik’s phone. The phone has since been seized.</p>
      <p>Erik told the police that the videos were for his own personal use and he had no intention of spreading them online. The suspect has been charged with violation of Indonesia’s anti-pornography laws, and may face up to 12 years in prison or a fine ranging from IDR250 million (US$17,732) to IDR6 billion (US$425,600).</p>
