      <h1>Police arrest 86 y.o. man for raping and impregnating his teenage granddaughter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:41:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>An 86-year-old man identified by his initial A was arrested this week in West Nusa Tenggara’s (NTB) Bima district under the suspicion that he raped his 17-year-old granddaughter.</p>
      <p>“Bima Police’s Women and Child Protection Unit [PPA] are examining and investigating the case further, to try and unveil this case of sexual abuse [against someone] underage that has resulted in pregnancy,” <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4783890/keji-kakek-di-bima-ntb-hamili-cucunya?tag_from=wpm_nhl_9">Purnama, a spokesman from NTB Police, told <i>Detik </i>today.</a></p>
      <p>A was arrested on Tuesday, after his daughter, identified as Am, filed a report against him to the police. The victim is A’s own granddaughter, a high school student identified as D, who has reportedly been abused sexually since she was in middle school.</p>
      <p>“The victim D has been living with the suspect since she was a child, and has a relationship as granddaughter and grandfather. Based on a statement from the reporter, who listened to the victim’s story, this has been going on since she was in Grade 8,” Purnama explained. </p>
      <p>According to the police, this case does not solely involve A, but three other people who have raped D on different occasions since 2017. Authorities have identified them by their initials: K, P and I.</p>
      <p>“At this time, [police in Bima] are continuing with their investigation by questioning the victim and witnesses. They’re also examining the crime scene and gathering evidence in order to arrest other [possible] suspects,” Purnama said.</p>
      <p>Sexual abuse of a minor is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison in Indonesia. However, A might receive an increase by up to a third of his eventual sentence due to his biological connection to the victim.</p>
