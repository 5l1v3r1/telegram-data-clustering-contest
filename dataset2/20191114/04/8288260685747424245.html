      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news and views | Looking ahead to the visit of Steve Bruce's Magpies on November 25 when the Premier League returns from a two-week hiatus for internationals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <h4>Rangers chief weighs in on Morelos rumours</h4>
      <p>Rangers' new sporting director Ross Wilson says his side do not need to sell <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> target Alfredo Morelos.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> has been heavily linked with Villa, the Colombian international in fine form at this early stage of the season, with Villa struggling in the forward department and in need of goals to bolster their hopes of surviving relegation in their first season back in the Premier League after three years out of the top flight.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/i-told-him-rangers-striker-17234360">netted his 22nd goal in his 26th match of the season</a> in Sunday's 2-0 win at Livingston in the Scottish Premiership.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has had to field no end of questions about his future, with Villa believed to one of a few Premier League teams monitoring the former HJK Helsinki man.</p>
      <h4>Grealish issues two-word injury update</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Jack Grealish</a> has posted on social media as he continues his comeback from a calf injury that has sidelined him for the past three matches.</p>
      <p>The Villa captain has missed the Carabao Cup and Premier League matches with Wolverhampton Wanderers and a League defeat to Liverpool because of a calf injury sustained in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester City last month.</p>
      <p>Villa <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-grealish-14251861">revealed on Wednesday that the 24-year-old would hopefully return</a> to training having been rated at 50-50 to feature against Wolves.</p>
      <p>Grealish has played 12 times for Villa this season, scoring four goals and setting up the same number for his team-mates.</p>

      <h4>Smith hopeful pair return for Newcastle</h4>
      <p>Villa boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> is hopeful that injured pair Tom Heaton and Bjorn Engels will be fit for the visit of Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Heaton (calf) missed the 2-1 defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> last time out as did Engels (hip).</p>
      <p>The Villa pair, summer signings from Burnley and Reims respectively, had previously started every match of the Premier League season so far.</p>
      <p>But they didn't make the Wolves game, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-grealish-14251861">with Jack Grealish compounding Smith's injury woes</a> by also sitting out of the Molineux trip.</p>
      <h4>The Liverpool verdict on McGinn</h4>
      <p>Liverpool director Kenny Dalglish has heaped praise on Villa midfielder <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> , ahead of the latest round of Scotland internationals.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has been in sparking form for the claret and blues since signing from Hibernian last season.</p>
      <p>His early season Premier League performances have earned him admirers up and down the country, including from Liverpool's arch rivals Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have been consistently linked with a move for McGinn, with some suggestions Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be willing to part with £50m for him.</p>
