      <h1>Dolly Parton's faith-based CMAs performance praised by fans: ‘Everyone should be made to listen to this’</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/dolly-parton">Dolly Parton</a> is never short on delivering heart-stopping moments.</p>
      <p>Wearing multiple hats on one of country music’s biggest nights, the “9 to 5” songstress traded her hosting duties for a pulpit when she took center stage Wednesday at the 2019 CMAs and belted out a trio of faith-based anthems for a medley of her own.</p>
      <p>Tapping Christian pop duo King &amp; Country for their collaboration of “God Only Knows,” Parton set the audience up for an unexpected trip to church when she then brought out Zach Williams for a rendition of “There Was Jesus,” before going solo and summoning a gospel choir for her offering of “Faith,” in which she collaborates with Galantis and Mr. Probz.</p>

      <p>“Thank you @DollyParton for the BEST performance of the night! @KeithUrban did an awesome job too!” wrote one user, while another echoed the sentiment, <a href="http://twitter.com/inkedbarbiexxx/status/1194816275521912833">adding</a>, “Literally sat here like a giddy child watching Dolly Parton sing on the CMAs.”</p>

      <p>However, while many fans were in awe of the 73-year-old Parton’s ability to set the stage ablaze with just her voice, others were head-over-heels in love with the fact they were able to witness faith-based music from Parton on national TV.</p>

      <p>“I’m sorry, @DollyParton singing worship music is everything. Everyone should be made to listen to this. Love this. I swear there would be a lot less hate in the world if everyone did. @CountryMusic #CMAs,” another emphatically shared.</p>

      <p>Another reverberated the sentiment, <a href="http://twitter.com/SLMC77/status/1194816201916063744">writing</a>, “Taking us to church- Amazing!” and tagging the three performing acts on stage.</p>
      <p>While another fan simply <a href="http://twitter.com/CheriRoman/status/1194816659523096576">wrote</a>, “Best quote tonight at #CMA by @DollyParton, of course--"Everybody at the CMAs, keep the faith!" @CountryMusic.”</p>
