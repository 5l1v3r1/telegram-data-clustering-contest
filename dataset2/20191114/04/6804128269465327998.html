      <p>It has been a busy day in terms of Tottenham Hotspur news.</p>
      <p>Focus for the players, or at least most of them, is on their international teams and playing for their countries over the next week or so.</p>
      <p>For Mauricio Pochettino, however, he needs to get his head around the club's plight in the Premier League and how to fix it.</p>
      <p>He will not be helped by an outspoken Danny Rose, opening up on his future in the media.</p>
      <p>That, and more, looking ahead to the January transfer window is here in our round-up of all the biggest stories from N17 in the past 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>Danny Rose warning</h3>
      <p>Danny Rose is never shy of an opinion.</p>
      <p>And the left-back has been speaking his mind once again.</p>
      <p>Footballers are often more liberal with their words when they're on international duty and Rose has been no different.</p>
