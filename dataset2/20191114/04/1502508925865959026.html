      <h1>Google to launch checking accounts next year in a tie-up with Citigroup</h1>
      <h2>The move would come as internet titans become increasingly involved in online financial transactions and e-commerce</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:10:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author">AFP | PTI</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>plans to launch a checking account service next year in a collaboration with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/citigroup">Citigroup </a>and a credit union in Silicon Valley, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In a project code named Cache, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>is working on a system that will host checking accounts clearly bearing the brands of the financial institutions, which will handle security and regulatory compliance issues, according to the Journal report.</p>
      <p>The report quoted a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>executive as saying the company's approach "is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system" in what might be seen as a longer but safer route.</p>
      <p>The move would come as internet titans become increasingly involved in online financial transactions and e-commerce.</p>
      <p>Apple and Google both offer digital wallets that can be used on smartphones to pay for purchases online or in real-world shops.</p>
      <p>Apple also recently released a credit card.</p>
      <p>Amazon has been reported to be in talks with banks about creating a checking account service.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Facebook has been steadily building up e-commerce tools at the social network as well as the ability to send money using its messaging apps such as WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>Facebook has gone a major step further, releasing controversial plans for a global cryptocurrency called Libra.</p>
      <p>Facebook had originally hoped to roll out Libra next year, but has met fierce resistance from regulators and governments who see it as a threat to their monetary sovereignty.</p>
      <p>The social media giant's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg last month opened the door to scaling back plans for Libra if it cannot win approval as a new currency for global exchanges.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg told US lawmakers on October 23 that the goal of Libra was "to build a global payment system rather than a currency".</p>
