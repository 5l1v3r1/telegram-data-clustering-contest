      <p>HIMMELPFORT, Germany (AP) — Santa Claus is at it again, answering thousands of Christmas letters from children around the world at a special post office in the northern German town of Himmelpfort.</p>
      <p>As part of the annual event organized by Germany’s Deutsche Post, Santa and 20 helpers last year responded to 277,200 letters from 64 countries.</p>
      <p>They answer in various languages and also in braille, and each letter has a special Santa postmark.</p>
      <p>The tradition began when postal workers in 1984 received two letters addressed to Santa in Himmelpfort, which means “heaven’s gate.”</p>
      <p>Not wanting to send them back “recipient unknown” they answered.</p>
      <p>All letters received between Thursday and Dec. 15 will be personally answered and returned before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Address letters to: An den Weihnachtsmann, Weihnachtspostfiliale, 16798, Himmelpfort, Germany. Remember a return address.</p>
