      <h2>David Black's family paid tribute to his bravery for "not letting go" after an attack left him bed-bound, following his death.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Leona Greenan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/leona-greenan/</a></address>
      <p>A dad left in a vegetative state following a vicious assault has died five years later.</p>
      <p>Family man David Black was 35 when he was attacked by Raymond Bell, then 29, and left for dead after a house party in November 2014.</p>
      <p>His injuries, including a bleed on the brain, were so severe they changed his life forever and rendered the dad-of-two bed-bound and only able to communicate with his family by blinking.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old Celtic fan, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/blantyre">Blantyre</a>, Lanarkshire, passed away at Kilbryde Hospice on October 27 from bronchial pneumonia. His heartbroken mum Kate Neil said: “David was an amazing son, brother and dad.</p>
      <p>“He gave our life meaning and faith and showed us what love was. He will be extremely missed and loved forever and left a lasting impression on everyone he met.</p>

      <p>“He fought the hardest battle on Earth and even until the end continued to show us just how strong, brave and beautiful his soul truly was. I laid a crucifix on his chest and he passed away peacefully. David was not afraid to die and I was not afraid to let him go.”</p>
      <p>Kate was forced to turn her living room into a makeshift hospital ward in a bid to provide her son with at-home care while awaiting an appropriate adapted property.</p>
      <p>She added: “A huge thank you to the staff at the hospice. From the minute he was admitted there he had a cheeky grin and his blue lips turned pink again. He was at peace and so were we.”</p>
      <p>David was found barely alive in a coma five days after the attack. The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> heard that Bell inflicted horrific injuries on David, repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head.</p>
      <p>He denied the attack but was convicted of attempted murder and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prisons">jailed</a> for nine years.</p>
      <p>A date for David’s funeral is yet to be confirmed.</p>
