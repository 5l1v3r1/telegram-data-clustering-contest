      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): Airbnb looks to empower travelling beyond big cities, as it raked in nearly 6,800 guests into host communities in Sabah and Sarawak to collectively earn approximately RM1.4 million in the span of less than a week earlier this year.</p>
      <p>This was in conjunction with the Rainforest World Music Festival held in July 2019 in Kuching, Sarawak, which saw just over 1,500 guests, leading to host earnings of almost RM265,000, and the Kota Kinabalu Jazz Festival in August 2019, where more than 5,000 guests brought in host earnings of nearly RM1.2 million.</p>
      <p>"As the world's largest community-driven hospitality platform, Airbnb is committed to working with local governments and tourism organisations to offer a sustainable solution, helping towns and cities benefit from the influx of tourism around big events without having to invest in additional infrastructure," Airbnb Southeast Asia head of public policy Mich Goh said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>"In preparation for Visit Malaysia 2020, we are looking to continue making travel to emerging destinations more accessible, and empowering local hospitality entrepreneurs to share their spaces and passions with guests around the world," she added.</p>
      <p>Airbnb noted that the number of Airbnb guest arrivals visiting off-the-beaten path destinations in Malaysia grew by 98% year-on-year in 2018, driven by travellers increasingly seeking more local, unique and authentic experiences.</p>
      <p>"By helping spread tourism across Malaysia, Airbnb is bringing the economic benefits of tourism to local communities that haven't shared these benefits in the past," it said.</p>
      <p>Goh noted that there is a growing Airbnb community in Malaysia full of passionate people who care deeply about home sharing.</p>
      <p>"Recently, we saw the launch of Malaysia's first Airbnb Home Sharing Club by the host community in Kuala Lumpur, which allows hosts to come together to share advice and best practices, connect with other hosts, support volunteer activity and advocate for fair home sharing laws.</p>
      <p>"We hope to eventually expand the number of home sharing clubs to represent host communities nationwide," Goh added.</p>
