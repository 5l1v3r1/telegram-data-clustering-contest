      <h1>Inside story of Kylie Jenner's $1bn empire - and her big break into industry</h1>
      <h2>Kylie Jenner has become the youngest billionaire after her cosmetic company became a global phenomenon and there were a couple of key moments to that success</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:29:03+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:29</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> is a self-made billionaire after her cosmetics company was valued at more than $900 million (£700 million).</p>
      <p>Kylie Cosmetics has been a roaring success and the 22-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star owns every single part of it.</p>
      <p>She launched the company in 2016, selling a $29 (£22) "lip kit" and by the end of 2018 she had sold more then $630 million (£490 million) worth of her products.</p>
      <p>Kylie keeps the operation simple by employing just seven full-time staff and five part-timers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/">Forbes</a> has reported that Kylie outsources the manufacturing and packaging of her products to Seed Beauty, a private-label producer in nearby Oxnard, California, while her online outlet is managed by Shopify.</p>

      <p>Of course, momager Kris Jenner looks after all the finances, for her usual 10% cut, or management fee as it is put, and then the rest is down to Kylie's huge social media presence and influence.</p>
      <p>With more than 150 million followers on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> and a further 30 million on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Kylie has set up a platform to spread her message far and wide without having to pay a cent in advertising.</p>
      <p>Kylie admits: "Social media is an amazing platform. I have such easy access to my fans and my customers."</p>
      <p>She then uses this to the full with almost hourly reminders of her products and videos of what shades Kylie Cosmetics are selling.</p>
      <p>The launch of a new product can reach millions in seconds, with the photogenic Jenner ensuring she is posing provocatively for each new launch, to ensure there are headlines to help promote the products.</p>

      <p>With many of her followers being young women and girls, she has an audience that is the ideal demographic for her products.</p>
      <p>Another 22 million follow Kylie Cosmetics directly and this instant access to her client base has meant that Kylie has been able to capitalise on her social media presence and the influence she has.</p>

      <p>Of course, the interest in the Kardashians is huge and Kylie will always get a boost from her life being laid bare in their reality show.</p>
      <p>Fans have bought into her private life and this in turn has helped her get them to buy into her make-up business.</p>
