      <p>Ambulance bosses are to apologise to a 97-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/four-humble-scots-war-heroes-20855438">World War II</a> hero who was left in agony for more than three hours after breaking his hip.</p>

      <p>Labour’s health Monica Lennon said: “It’s upsetting to hear that anyone in severe pain has been made to wait hours for an ambulance, least of all a 97-year-old veteran who has served his country.”</p>
      <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service said it would carry out a full inquiry into <br/>the “circumstances of the delay”.</p>
