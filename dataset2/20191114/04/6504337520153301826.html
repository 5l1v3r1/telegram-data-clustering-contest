      <p>A car in flames shut down several lanes of the Bay Bridge on Wednesday night, as emergency responders worked to put out the fire.</p>
      <p>The fire was first reported just before 8 p.m., on the eastbound side of the Bay Bridge, past Treasure Island. The car was on the right side of the road as it continued to burn, forcing California Highway Patrol officers to shut down a number of lanes while firefighters worked to put the fire out.</p>
      <p>The fire was extinguished as of 8:15 p.m., said Officer Eric Anderson with the CHP.</p>
      <p>Both the driver and a passenger were reportedly able to get out of the vehicle, according to the CHP traffic incident page.</p>
      <p>CHP officers on the scene closed three right-hand lanes of traffic and cars were moved around the fire via the two left-hand lanes during the shutdown.</p>
      <p>All lanes have since reopened as of 8:50 p.m.</p>
