      <h1>It’s Time To Admit Climate Denial Is Making Australia’s Bushfires Worse</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:01:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:01</time> by <a rel="author">Elfy Scott</a></address>
      <p>Extensive and devastating bushfires along the east coast have made this week horrifying for a lot of Australians.</p>
      <p>At least <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-14/nsw-fires-death-toll-rises-after-fourth-body-found/11703328">four lives</a> have been lost in the unprecedented blazes and more than 200 properties have been destroyed in NSW since Friday.</p>
      <p>Koala populations have also been severely impacted, with at least 350 animals dying after fires swept through the Lake Innes Nature Reserve.</p>

      <p>Catastrophic fire warnings were issued in the Sydney region for the first time ever and people across NSW and Queensland have been on high alert packing up their homes and preparing to evacuate.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://junkee.com/nsw-bushfires-scott-morrison/228886">they’ve been happy to supply “thoughts and prayers”</a>, the government has been totally unwilling to engage with the idea that this is climate change in action and it’s understandably making people really angry.</p>

      <h3>Climate Change Is Making Our Fire Seasons More Destructive</h3>
      <p>Over 300 fires burned across NSW earlier this week and they’ve been burning down forestry like wetlands and subtropical rainforests that just should not be burning.</p>
      <p>Drought, extreme heat and hectic winds have all contributed to making these fires more intense than we’ve ever seen them before.</p>
      <p>Everybody really needs to pay attention to that idea: they have just never been this bad before.</p>

      <p>Greg Mullins is the former NSW fire commissioner and he wrote <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/this-is-not-normal-what-s-different-about-the-nsw-mega-fires-20191110-p5395e.html">this week</a> that if anybody tries to say that Australia has had fires like this, smile politely and walk away, because they don’t know what they’re talking about.</p>
      <p>And, as if we needed any more reminding of the direction our climate is going, Tuesday was Australia’s first rain-free day on record.</p>
      <p>Like, absolutely no rain. Anywhere. For 7.6 million square kilometres.</p>
      <h3>And Yet, Politicians Are Still Totally Failing To Address How These Fires Are Related To Climate Change.</h3>
      <p>Whenever climate change has been brought up with Liberal and Nationals politicians this week, we’ve been getting dismissive reactions.</p>
      <p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian stated on Monday that while there’s no doubt that the drought conditions have contributed to the severity of the fires, it was “not appropriate to get into a political argument as to what the causes are at this stage”</p>
      <p>They say they’re focusing on the needs of the people affected by this week’s fires and they’re telling us to stop politicising the disaster.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They’re telling us there’s a time and a place to discuss climate change and that time and place is NOT a press conference about fires that are literally being driven by climate change events.</p>
      <p>Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack even said on Monday that people drawing the lines between climate change and the fires were “ inner-city raving lunatics “</p>
      <p>Despite this, the bushfires are pointing yet another finger at a broad failure of policy on climate change.</p>
      <p>Fire controllers and scientists have been warning the government about the growing threat of bushfires for a really long time.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year a group of emergency services chiefs wrote a joint letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying they wanted to meet with him to talk about climate change risks.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/zdaniel/status/1193297938476347398?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>The emergency chiefs also wanted to launch a parliamentary inquiry to ensure emergency services were adequately equipped.</p>
      <p>Morrison responded by not meeting with them at all and the Berejiklian government has cut $26.7 million in funding to the Rural Fire Service and $12.9 million to Fire and Rescue.</p>
      <p>The forecast from climate scientists is really dire and all indications say the situation is only going to get worse.</p>
      <p>One report from 2007 said that the number of ‘extreme’ fire danger days on the east coast could increase by up to 25% by 2020 (yes that’s next year 2020) and by up to 70% by 2050.</p>
      <h3>For A Really Long Time Now, It’s Been Feeling Like Scientists Are Just Screaming Into The Void.</h3>
      <p>Doctor Grant Wardell-Johnson, an associate professor in biodiversity and climate from Curtin University, said earlier this week that climate change is more serious than any war we have ever faced.</p>
      <p>He also said that endless solutions have been presented to the government and they need to be enacted now or the situation will spiral rapidly beyond our control.</p>
      <p>This has been a horrifying week for a lot of Australians and it’s thrown into sharp relief the government’s total failure to prepare for an impending climate crisis.</p>
