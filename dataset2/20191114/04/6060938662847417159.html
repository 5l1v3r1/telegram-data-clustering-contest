      <h1>Will Pucovski withdraws from Australia squad again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T04:09:04+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 04:09</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Promising batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Will-Pucovski">Will Pucovski</a> has ruled himself out of selection for Australia's Test series against Pakistan due to "matters pertaining to mental wellbeing", <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cricket-Australia">Cricket Australia</a> said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old right-hander was in the running to make his Test debut but reported the issue to team management in Perth while playing for Australia A against Pakistan, where he was out for five in the first innings and did not bat in the second.</p>
      <p>Ben Oliver, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Australia’s EGM of National Teams, said Australian cricket would always place the wellbeing of its people ahead of performance.</p>
      <p>“We applaud Will for having the courage to discuss his situation with team management,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Will’s decision not to nominate for Test selection was the right one in the circumstances and one that everyone in the Australian cricket family supports."</p>
      <p>Pucovski, who hit 243 for Victoria in a Sheffield Shield game against Western Australia last year, has previously taken a six-week break from cricket because of mental health issues and left the Australia squad that played Sri Lanka this year for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Australia will name their squad later on Thursday for next week's first Test in Brisbane.</p>
