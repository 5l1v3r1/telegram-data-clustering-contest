      <p>A 'disruptive' <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Scots tycoon</a> – who scooped £9million after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-tycoon-slated-foul-mouthed-20868542">flogging his travel empire</a> – was barred from his old firm’s stores, a tribunal heard.</p>
      <p>Bill Munro, 75, sold Barrhead Travel for £36million, netting a £9million personal jackpot, but was accused by buyers Travel Leaders of refusing to let the business go.</p>
      <p>The US firm banned him from travel shops, saying he disrupted staff and discussed the firm’s sale.</p>
      <p>The Record revealed that Jonathan Knapp, a senior vice-president with Travel Leaders, made Munro redundant months after buying the firm last year. During the deal, Knapp sent an email saying: “F*** him. I’m happy to acquiesce but my recommendation is to serve him notice day one after completion.”</p>

      <p>At the tribunal, Travel Leader CEO Ninan Chacko said: “Mr Munro felt he had licence to do what he wanted in the business and interpreted everything as a licence for him to continue. He was disruptive in our view and in Barrhead management’s view. It was tantamount to wanting your cake and eating it, too.</p>
      <p>“He entered Barrhead premises at one point ostensibly to book a holiday but started discussing the (sale) situation with staff. It was ultimately disruptive to Barrhead and staff.</p>
      <p>“It was thoroughly inappropriate. He was excluded from the stores.”</p>
      <p>Munro was offered a new job with Travel Leaders UK but refused as it removed his 42 years of continuous service with the firm. He launched a legal action, claiming unfair dismissal and wants reinstated.</p>
      <p>The tribunal continues.</p>
