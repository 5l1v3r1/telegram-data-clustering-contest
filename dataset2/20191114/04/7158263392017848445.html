      <p>So you want bigger, fuller, holy-wow lips, eh? Maybe you’ve been inspired by the recent trend of EVERY SINGLE CELEBRITY getting lip injections or maybe you’ve always wanted to pump up your natural lips a bit. Either way, the question of how to make your lips bigger is a very common one (like, I get a text about it all too frequently). But here’s the thing: Unless you want to get <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/advice/a41046/lip-injection-facts/">lip injections</a>—which are truly not as scary as they sound but do kinda hurt and can cost anywhere between $500 and $2,000—there’s no tried-and-true DIY way to get bigger lips that last.<br/><br/>Still, that doesn’t mean you need to go under the needle to get some immediate plumping effects. With the right combo of products and techniques, even naturally thin lips can look a little <i>va-va-voom</i>. And to help you out on your lip journey, I broke down every tip, trick, and product, below, to help you get bigger lips ASAP.</p>
      <h3>1 How to Get Bigger Lips: Temporary “Filler” SkinMedica HA5 Smooth and Plump Lip System</h3>

      <p>Think of this two-step plumping system as needle-free fillers (except, you know, temporary. Womp). Each tube contains a blend of five different types of <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g28948492/best-hyaluronic-acid-serum/">hyaluronic acid</a>—a naturally occurring molecule that <b>can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water</b>—to subtly make your lips look bigger, plumper, and more volumized without the irritants.</p>

      <p>Okay, I know this is the most basic-seeming tip, but you’d be surprised by how a little <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a26105847/diy-lip-scrub-recipe/">lip scrub</a> can go a really, really long way. Why? It’s a basic optical illusion:<b> The smoother the surface, the more light it can reflect.</b> And more light means bigger-looking lips. Gently buff your lips each morning in circles with a lip scrub or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Manual-Toothbrushes/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3778211">toothbrush</a> to lift flakes.</p>

      <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/advice/g3071/fuller-lips/">lip-plumping gloss</a> is the most obvious step to getting bigger lips, but it’s timeless for a reason: It really works. This super-shiny gloss is filled with plant extracts and hyaluronic acid to <b>give you immediate fullness without any of the stinging</b>, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Oh, and it comes in six shades (including clear), if neutral isn’t your thing.</p>

      <p>Regardless of what your #TBT photos say, your lips probably weren’t massively bigger in junior high—they were just being illuminated with a constant sheen of sticky <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g12447782/best-lip-gloss/">lip gloss</a>. That doesn’t mean you need to go back to the hair-glued-to-lips days, but definitely<b> ditch your <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g26099200/best-matte-lipstick-colors/">matte lipsticks</a> for a high-shine gloss</b>, like this one from Hourglass (which also comes in neutral and clear shades).</p>

      <p>Not a fan of the gloss but still want bigger lips? Try a lip oil, which gives you all the same shine benefits without any of the stickiness or weight. And for an added bonus, try a formula loaded with peppermint, which<b> naturally “irritates” your lips just a little bit to help plump them up</b> (don’t freak—it’s a common lip ingredient for this very reason).</p>

      <p>Lip contouring? Yup, it’s a thing, and as someone who has personally tried this, I can attest that it really, truly works. Just grab a <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g9209102/best-lip-liners/">lip liner</a> one shade darker than your natural lip color (or the gloss or lipstick you’re planning to wear), <b>line your lips, </b><b>scribble in the corner Vs of your mouth, and draw a line down the center of your bottom lip</b>. Soften the lines by gently smudging them with your finger, then add your gloss or lipstick. Confused?

      <p>Hi, you know that little dip on the top of your lip? That’s your Cupid’s bow, and it’s the very underappreciated VIP of faking bigger lips.

      <p>Logic check! Bigger objects create bigger shadows, right? Right. So to fake a bigger bottom lip (dare I say ~*PiLLoWy*~), blend a bit of bronzer or contour powder or matte <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g25572959/drugstore-bronzer/">bronzer</a> in the half-inch space beneath your lower lip. Just a sheer layer, blended back and forth, <b>will create the illusion of ultra-plump lips</b>. Hey, I don’t make these optical rules—I just follow them.</p>
