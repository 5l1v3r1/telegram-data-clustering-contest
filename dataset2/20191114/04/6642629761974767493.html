      <p>The<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html"> United States</a> will maintain about 600 troops in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a>, Pentagon chief Mark Esper said on Wednesday, despite <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a>'s desire to end US involvement in what the president calls "endless wars".</p>
      <p>"We're still moving troops out of northeastern Syria," the US defence secretary said as he travelled to Seoul, where he begins a tour of Asia on Thursday.</p>

      <p>"We're going to have about 500 to 600-ish troops there, at the end of the day," Esper said.<br/><br/>Asked if that figure included the approximately 200 troops deployed to the Al-Tanf base near the southeastern borders with Jordan and Iraq, Esper said that he was referring to northeastern Syria, where Trump has instructed the Pentagon to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/deploy-troops-eastern-syrian-secure-oil-fields-191025022517393.html">secure oil fields.</a></p>
      <p>There would be "600-ish" troops across the country, he then reiterated.<br/><br/>Esper said that the numbers could fluctuate, particularly if European allies strengthened their presence in the country.<br/><br/>"Things change. Events on the ground change. We could have, for example, partners and allies from Europe joining us," he said. "If they join us on the ground it may allow us the ability to redeploy further US forces out there."<br/><br/>Trump's abrupt announcement last month that he had <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/white-house-turkey-military-operation-northern-syria-191007034354242.html">ordered a full troop withdrawal </a>drew angry rebukes at home and abroad. <br/><br/>Critics said it could allow a resurgence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL </a>or ISIS) group while leaving US-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria vulnerable to a Turkish offensive.<br/><br/>The US president later relented in part, saying he would leave some troops in the region to protect valuable oil fields.</p>
