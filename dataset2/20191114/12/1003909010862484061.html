      <h1>Nelson: A suggested Alberta sales tax is just another red herring</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:05:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Nelson, For The Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The amount of righteous chatter about Alberta’s need to introduce a sales tax across our province is now reaching deafening proportions.</p>
      <p>Never in the field of Canadian history, it would seem, have so many wanted so much to pay more to some government.</p>
      <p>Now, this appears very odd at first glance. Why, for heaven’s sake, would any sane person want to hand over even more of their cash to any level of government? Imagine the giant grin spreading across our current mayor’s face if he and a collection of his favourite swashbuckling spenders on city council suddenly received permission to invoke a Calgary-wide sales tax, for example. Does that idea make you feel slightly queasy?</p>
      <p>Yet these sales tax calls persist. In fact, they’re getting louder. But if any of these selfless souls have a particular area of society they believe desperately needs extra moolah, then surely there is a host of suitable charities they can donate to? Nope, there’s more to this than some folk simply having a particularly large societal heart.</p>
      <p>Ah, but the clue to this conundrum is actually quite straightforward. Those advocating a sales tax — and it’s always (just like that famous yellow polka dot bikini) an itsy bitsy, teeny weeny one to start with — usually toil at a job in the public sector, academia or aboard some type of government-funded think tank or special interest group.</p>
      <p>And, those folk can smell the financial fish a-baking these days in Alberta and something smells more than a little off to them.</p>
      <p>Of course: now we understand. These advocates want a sales tax not for society’s sake but for their own. Because, if governments manage to get their clammy paws on even more cash courtesy of ordinary Albertans, then they can spend it on ensuring the programs and areas in which these people are employed continue unabated: poof go those current threats of cuts, rollbacks and frozen spending.</p>
      <p>So don’t for a moment believe this sales tax movement is tied to any desire for a balanced budget. That is just a smokescreen, a way to camouflage the true intent. All extra tax revenue will get spent and we’ll remain as unbalanced as a three-legged elk during rutting season.</p>
      <p>Want an example? Then look to Ontario, which has an effective provincial sales tax of eight per cent (added onto the federal GST of five per cent). It also carries an accumulated debt quickly closing in on $350 billion, which currently sucks up about $13 billion each year in interest charges. Hey, maybe hiking the sales tax to 20 per cent will solve their budgetary problems as well? Then again: maybe not.</p>
      <p>It is poppycock. Actually, Alberta has had its own form of sales tax for decades. It went by the name of energy royalties. If we’d been smarter, like the Norwegians, we’d have saved that bonanza but, other than a few years during the early Peter Lougheed era, we’ve merrily spent it. That’s why, despite no actual sales tax, our provincial government shells out more per head than any other in Canada.</p>
      <p>Yet on top of that big nut, we’re supposed to believe giving them even more money to waste is the way to go?</p>
      <p>Do it and soon we’d have transit green lines, blue lines and red lines crisscrossing Calgary in a way that would put our current rainbow nation of garbage bins to shame. And when we then need the ultimate purple line, what would be the proposed solution? Jack another percentage point on the existing sales tax.</p>
      <p>That’s how it goes folks. Give them two per cent and soon it’ll be 10.</p>
      <p>There’s little Alberta Advantage left these days, but not having to fork over a sales tax — a cost that hits the poorest folk hardest of all — is still something to be proud of.</p>
