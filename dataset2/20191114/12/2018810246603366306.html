      <p>Who wants to roll Shannon Noll in an esports tournament?</p>
      <p>So around about PAX one of the funnier — or weirder — PR stunts was unveiled. Shannon Noll, a living meme, would be making his own team for <i>PUBG</i>. The team would be playing in a open tournament for a <a href="https://legion.lenovo.com/t/TkRnPQ==/loc-iv-pubg-aus-and-nz-qualifier">Lenovo sponsored event on November 16</a>, which just meant everyone else could team up for the chance to talk shit to the former <i>Australian Idol</i> star over voice chat.</p>
      <p>But now Noll's joined by some other members who might be worth bantering as well. The other three members of this weird, celebrity <i>PUBG</i> team include Sydney socialite Roxy Jacenko, speedskater and accidental Olympic winner Stephen Bradbury, and the only member of the group who actually plays <i>PUBG</i> regularly, <i>Love Island</i> member Cassidy McGill:</p>

      <p>25 teams have been approved for the <a href="https://legion.lenovo.com/t/TkRnPQ==/loc-iv-pubg-aus-and-nz-qualifier">online ANZ qualifiers so far</a>, with another 11 pending approval. There are actual <i>PUBG</i> teams in the mix, like Team Immunity, and the winners of the online qualifiers will get sent to a second stage to earn the chance to play at the world finals in Bangkok's Pantip Plaza in mid-December.</p>
      <p>The chances of them getting through the initial qualifiers — or more than a couple of kills — are less than zero, but I can totally see the team copping some interesting treatment at the hands of the rest of the server. Maybe a couple of teams decide to sacrifice themselves to further the cause of Nollsy. Maybe everyone just surrounds them in a building and shouts Shannon Noll memes at the squad through voice chat. Or maybe the team discovers that <i>PUBG</i> <a href="https://forums.pubg.com/topic/159149-why-does-this-game-make-me-have-to-poop/">has its own brand of poo-jogging</a>.</p>
      <p>"I’m also confident my underdog skills are intact, maybe I'll ‘Do A Bradbury’," Stephen Bradbury said in a release.</p>
      <p>And who knows. Maybe he will. Brendan Greene has some useful advice on that front.</p>
