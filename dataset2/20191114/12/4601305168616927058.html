      <h1>Meet Narwhal, an abandoned puppy with an extra tail on his head</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:32:16+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>Staff at <a href="https://www.iampitbullstrong.com/">Mac's Mission</a>, an animal rescue center in Missouri, named him Narwhal. The healthy 10-week-old pup has an extra tail, smack in the middle of his forehead.</p>
      <blockquote>Rochelle Steffen, who runs Mac's Mission, named after a pit-bull terrier she rescued seven and a half years ago, told BBC News Narwhal "is in no pain and plays for hours". ... And X-rays had showed his secondary tail, about a third the size of his actual tail, was not connected to anything and served no purpose other than to make him the "coolest puppy ever".</blockquote>
      <p>Narwhal will not be made available for adoption until he's grown up some, to confirm the secondary tail is healthy.</p>
