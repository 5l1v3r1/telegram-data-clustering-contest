      <h1>MAS Architecture Studio's wind tower keeps visitors cool without air-conditioning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:45:22+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/natashah-hitti/" target="_blank">Natashah Hitti</a></address>
      <p>MAS Architecture Studio favoured passive ventilation over high-tech solutions in this installation for <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dubai-design-week/">Dubai Design Week</a>, which reimagines Emirati wind towers using 480 layers of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/recycled/">recycled</a> cardboard.</p>
      <p>Located in Dubai's design district, the Barjeel – or wind tower – installation adopts a more traditional approach to air-conditioning than the electrical methods used in the surrounding high-rises.</p>
      <p>Carved from layers of recycled <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/cardboard/">cardboard</a> and sheets of aluminium, the six-metre-tall structure was designed as a modern take on the wind towers found in the Arabian Gulf.</p>

      <p>Intended as an "homage to regional traditions", the barjeel features a circular base, which can be seen in the seating inside, and a square body in reference to the simple geometric forms that are ubiquitous in Islamic architecture.</p>
      <p>"Barjeels have been used for passive ventilation over centuries," <a href="https://www.mas-arch.com/">MAS Architecture Studio</a> founder Kerim Miskavi told Dezeen. "Nowadays they're being used less and less because, today, the typical answer to acclimatisation is high technology and mechanical systems."</p>
      <p>"We wanted to create something that was specific to the region and drew inspiration from the vernacular architecture, but we also wanted to create a space where the visitors could come in and relax," he added.</p>

      <p>The installation works in the same way as a traditional barjeel – a wind catcher on top of the structure catches the wind and directs it downwards to bring a cool breeze into the space. Barjeels were commonly erected on the roof of a building.</p>
      <p>Hotter air inside the structure circulates and rises to the top. Cut-outs are positioned around the structure just above seated head-level, to offer further breeze to those sitting inside.</p>
      <p>Visitors can take refuge from the sun inside the tower, which was created for this year's Dubai Design Week.</p>

      <p>"Nowadays Dubai is known for its towers – a huge skyline with the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/burj-khalifa/">Burj Khalifa</a> and all these modern high-tech towers," said the designer.</p>
      <p>"But when you think about it, the barjeel was probably the first tower built in Dubai, and it was used for a very different reason; it was purely performative and for people's comfort," he continued.</p>
      <p>"We liked this notion that the wind tower is a very human phenomenon in architecture," he added. "It's a good mix between function and symbolism, but it's neither purely symbolic or purely functional, and I think it fits well in a context like this."</p>

      <p>With the first examples dating back to 3100 BC, historically the wind towers were built to accompany small houses and villas in the region, acting as natural, non-electrical forms of air-conditioning.</p>
      <p>Originally made from basic materials such as palm branches and leaves, the Barjeel gradually increased in scale and advanced in materials, eventually being made from mud, <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/clay/">clay</a> and bricks.</p>
      <p>The Istanbul-based studio designed its version of the structure to be zero-waste, assembled from 480 layers of reclaimed cardboard.</p>

      <p>As Miskavi explained, the studio chose recycled cardboard not only for its sustainable qualities, but also for it's strong yet lightweight properties, as the structure had to be pre-fabricated in Turkey and shipped to Dubai.</p>
      <p>The structure is fixed in place through gravity and compression, with no adhesive used to secure the layers together.</p>

      <p>Between every 90 or so layers of cardboard is an aluminium sheet, while four aluminium posts penetrate the structure at each corner and attach to a metal base – which Miskavi describes as a "skewer-like" system.</p>
      <p>Both the cardboard and aluminium has been left untreated, to keep the installation as organic as possible.</p>
      <p>According to Miskavi, the corrugated design of the cardboard also grants the installation a "transparency" and "openness" by allowing some light into the structure. When rotated 90 degrees however, the material becomes solid and opaque.</p>

      <p>Now in its fifth edition, <a href="https://www.dubaidesignweek.ae/">Dubai Design Week</a> hosts an array of events, including the Downtown Design trade fair and the Global Grad show, as well as numerous installations and pavilions dotted around the city.</p>
      <p>The annual event is taking place this year from 11 to 16 November 2019, with most attractions located in the city's design district, also known as D3.</p>
