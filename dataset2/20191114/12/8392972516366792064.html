      <p>Step aside mince pies and Christmas pud, there's only one dessert we want on December 25 and that's McDonald's new Snickerdoodle McFlurry.</p>
      <p>Billed as a "creamy, sweet treat perfect for the holiday season", McDonald's say the Snickerdoodle McFlurry "is made with creamy vanilla soft serve with Snickerdoodle topping mixed throughout".</p>

      <p>For those not in the know, Snickerdoodle is a type of cookie that's full of the flavours of the festive season because it's rolled in cinnamon sugar.</p>

      <p>It's available via McDelivery until November 17.</p>
