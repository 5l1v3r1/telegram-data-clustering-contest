      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission says no voter will be allowed to vote without voter card recognised by the Smart Card Reader in the November 16 elections in Bayelsa and Kogi.</p>
      <p>Prof. James Apam, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, told NAN on the sideline of a one-day Training on Election Duties, organised by Federal Road Safety Corps for its Staff at Kogi Sector Command Headquarters in Lokoja.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of Apam, Olugbenga Ajayi, a staff officer of the commission, warned that no person would be allowed to vote without being accredited using the card reader.</p>
      <p>“We keep learning everyday; and we want to obey what we have said as electoral umpire; if card reader cannot identify you, you cannot vote.</p>
      <p>“It is either card reader or no voting in Kogi and Bayelsa elections; anything apart from the use of card reader for accreditation and voting will be disqualified.</p>
      <p>“No manual accreditation would be allowed; it is either card reader or no voting,” he reiterated.</p>
      <p>He enjoined all the personnel participating in the elections to conduct themselves very well and not to compromise but respect their dignity and protect the sanctity of the elections.</p>
      <p>He further urged other security personnel to adequately secure electoral staff and election materials, saying all eyes are on Kogi and Bayelsa elections.</p>
      <p>He also called for timely arrival of security personnel at INEC Local Government Secretariat, who would be escorting their staff and election materials to INEC Registration Area Centre for timely dispatched.</p>
      <p>“We urged the security personnel to live by the oath they swore to and not chasing after politicians for money,” he said.</p>
