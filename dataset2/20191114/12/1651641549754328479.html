        <b>Just a few minutes after the leaked release date for Halo Reach, Xbox’s Bleeding Edge release date has also been leaked. Whoopsie.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/heres-everything-that-happened-at-xboxs-e3-2019-conference/">Announced during Xbox’s E3 2019 presentation</a>, the upcoming online-multiplayer arena brawler is a stark contrast from developer <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">Ninja Theory’s critically acclaimed Hellblade</a>.</p>
      <p>Just like with the Halo Reach leak, this new leak was also spotted by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39681/bleeding-edge-release-date-closed-beta">TrueAchievements</a>. Through another slip-up on the Microsoft Store, we now know that the title is scheduled to release in March.</p>
      <p>According to the game’s Microsoft Store page, Bleeding Edge will release officially on March 24th. However, there are two other release dates for upcoming betas for both <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xbox-game-pass-discord-nitro/">Xbox Game Pass members </a>and those who pre-order the game.</p>
      <p>The title’s two closed betas will be within a fairly close proximity to each other. The first closed beta will begin on February 14th whereas the second beta will kick off on March 13th.</p>
      <p>While the Bleeding Edge release date was leaked, that’s not all that the Microsoft Store let out. Pre-order bonuses are also available: anyone who pre-orders or plays the game before March 31st will get access to the Punk Pack.</p>
      <p>The Punk Pack gives players access to a decent chunk of content. There’s three skins for playable characters Nidhoggr, Buttercup and Zero Cool, a sticker pack, three taunts and Rioter’s Hoverboar.</p>
