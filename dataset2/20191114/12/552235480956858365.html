      <p>Calum Mackenzie from Alness was last seen at around 1.45pm on Thursday, November 7 in the Dalmore area.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-search-man-missing-highlands-20845817">We told</a> how he did not turn up for tea with his parents on Thursday afternoon, who then raised the alarm</p>
      <p>He was seen on CCTV visiting the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/supermarket">Morrisons</a> on Dalmore Road shortly before 1.30pm.</p>
      <p>He purchased food before leaving the store on foot.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Officers</a> have said they will be stopping drivers and speaking to people in the area, a week from the last time he was seen in case they may have seen something which could help establish his subsequent movements.</p>
      <p>Further searches will also be carried out in the area today, with support from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> helicopter.</p>
      <p>Inspector Alasdair Goskirk said: "We will be speaking to drivers and pedestrians around the Morrisons and Lidl supermarkets in case there is anyone who regularly uses the route around that time who may have noticed something relating to Calum's disappearance, even if they didn't think much of it at the time.</p>
      <p>"We will also be distributing posters to people in the area."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 3129 of November 8. More here.</p>
