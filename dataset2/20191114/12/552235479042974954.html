      <h2>Police have launched an investigation after Christopher Smith, 61, was left with a bleed on the brain following the sickening attack in the Village.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:54:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>An elderly veteran who was jumped on Remembrance Day has said he 'feared for his life' during the vicious attack.</p>
      <p>And, shockingly, Christopher Smith, 61, from Calderwood in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbridehttps-wwwdailyrecordcouk-all-about-east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> is adamant that one of his attackers is a fellow veteran spotting medals on one of the assailants.</p>
      <p>Christopher, who served with the Royal Marines during the height of the troubles in Northern Ireland, has been left with a bleed on the brain, cracked ribs and bruised kidneys after the attack on Sunday just after 11pm on Stuart Street in the Village.</p>
      <p>The veteran is still recovering from a major heart attack earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He had spent the day paying his respects to the fallen and friends who didn't make it home and was heading home after a couple of drinks when two men in their 30s approached him out of the blue.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea who they were, I have never met them in my life before," he told the News.</p>
      <p>"One of them said something but he was so out of it and I couldn't understand him.  I just said to them to go away and leave me alone. I didn't want any trouble.</p>
      <p>"The guy who was wearing an Afghanistan medal said something about his friend dying over there, I said I had lost friends everywhere and the next thing I know I am being battered and face down on the ground."</p>

      <p>He went on: "I didn't know what to do, I couldn't fathom was happening - on Remembrance Day of all days. It is just unbelievable.</p>
      <p>"I remember at one point they left me in a heap, started to walk away and I thought I better try and get myself up but they came back for another go and set about me again, kicking and punching me on the face, head, body - everywhere. It was so vicious, I was just in total shock.</p>
      <p>"I honestly thought the second time that was it, they were going to kill me. I underwent major heart surgery earlier this year and died twice on the operating tabe."</p>
      <p>Christopher added: "Then after what was probably minutes, they walked off and just left me lying there face down in a puddle. I somehow managed to get myself  into the Village Inn for help. My face was in a right mess and I was in a state.</p>
      <p>"I just don't understand why this happened to me, I didn't do anyhing. It's horrific, especially as was of them was another veteran."</p>
      <p>Christopher received treatment at Hairmyres Hospital before being discharged and police have now launched an investgation.</p>
