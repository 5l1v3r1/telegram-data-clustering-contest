      <h1>Alicia Keys to Host 62nd Grammy Awards</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:54:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>Alicia Keys will be returning to host the 62nd Grammy Awards, announced the Recording Academy on Thursday. Accompanying the announcement was Keys taking to her social media channels and releasing a YouTube video in which she convinces last year’s host (<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/01/alicia-keys-to-host-grammys.html">also her</a>) to let her help out at the awards.</p>
      <p>Keys’ hosting stint last year was warmly received (we called it “<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/grammys-2019-the-recording-academy-steps-up-their.html">a spot of sunlight</a>”), with Recording Academy President and CEO Deborah Dugan saying in a statement that “Alicia Keys has been a beacon of artistry within the music community for more than two decades.” She continued: “Last year was a testament to her compelling creativity and we are thrilled that she will return to the Grammy stage as our host. Anything can happen, you don’t want to miss it!”</p>
      <p>Grammy nominees are set to be revealed on Nov. 20, with the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards taking place on Jan. 26, 2020 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The awards will be broadcast live on CBS and live-streamed on GRAMMY.com starting at 8 p.m. ET.</p>
