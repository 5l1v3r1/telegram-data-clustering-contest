        <b>The Department of State Services says it is prepared to release Omoyele Sowore, the convener of the planned RevolutionNow protest but waiting for appropriate persons to take his delivery.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Dr Peter Afunanya, the Public Relations’ Officer of the Service disclosed this in a statement on Thursday in Abuja.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>He said appropriate persons were yet to turn up to take his delivery adding that he would be released once the processes were concluded.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>According to him, it is only appropriate that those who stood surety for him present themselves and have him released to them.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>“While all those that have so far shown up are not directly concerned with the matter and therefore unqualified; many others have either chosen to grandstand or politicise it to achieve hidden interests.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>“The service reassures the public that it will not waste a second to release Sowore if the proper processes are followed,” he said.</b>
        <br/>
        <b> He said the service had in the last few days, continued to witness deliberate campaigns of calumny, threats and aspersions against it.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Afunanya said the DSS would not, for any reason, join issues with its Mudslingers adding that the role of the media was to be neutral and remain champions of truth. </b>
        <br/>
        <b>“It is even more disappointing that Mr Femi Falana, who is a senior lawyer, would wrongly guide his client and supporters. </b>
        <br/>
        <b>“He is rather playing to the gallery and mobilizing miscreants to subvert the Service and other state authorities. </b>
        <br/>
        <b>“He has excellent relationship with the DSS.  But in the circumstance, he has refused to reach out to him over the case like he had on previously related ones.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>“For the avoidance of doubt, the Service restates its commitment to the rule of law and particularly respect to the court,” he said.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>The information officer calls for calm but stated that the service would not be intimidated or harassed into hasty actions.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Afunanya had denied reports in some sections of the media that operatives of the service opened fire on alleged protesters who stormed its facility on November 12.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>He said the operatives had stood in defence of their facility when some group of persons made unruly attempts to forcefully break into DSS to effect the release of Sowore.</b>
        <br/>
        <b>“Despite serial and unwarranted provocations, the service, as a professional and responsible organisation, did not shoot at the so called protesters,” he added. </b>
