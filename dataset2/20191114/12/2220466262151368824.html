      <p>BEIRUT: The revolution clock yet ticks, and the pulse of my heart has become synchronized to it. For the last few weeks I have been looking into the mirror to find the revolution staring back at me.In the reflection, I see a woman with the power of incubating the warm cycle of life inside her body, and like the revolution, new existences can’t emerge without her.It’s been 28 days since everything about me changed and I slowly became metamorphosed as the revolution itself. How else would I describe this indescribable electricity being generated within me, as though it’s not my legs that carry me to the revolting streets but a staggering current of persistence and belonging? Every waking hour, the surface of my skin seems to be absorbing a new component of Lebanon's air that has also been occupying every corner within my body that had once felt futile: the filaments of the ongoing revolution.Even my dreams have become manifestations of figments of the revolution. After the adrenaline rush that seems to accompany me everywhere dissipates into my pillow and I fall asleep, my mind replays the revolution’s events.I dream of the son that watched his revolutionary father become a martyr, I dream of the instant the bullet went through Hussein al Attar’s young heart for having fought for injustice, and I dream of the tears that ran down the soldier’s face as he realized that the weapon he carried did not make him feel any less helpless.   However, I also dream of the warmth that was felt by the thousands of men and women that held each other’s hands from the South to the North of Lebanon. I dream of the mothers that cooked food for the protesters without expecting anything in return, I dream of the people that sacrificed their own comfort to swipe the demonstration sites clean, and I dream of the sense of hope that has been revived in the Lebanese spirit.Before October 17, I used to resort to the comfort of my home to refuel my inner fire. Now, I find home in the revolting streets and family in their people. I find comfort in the adrenaline rush of the dancing, the chanting, the constructive discussions, and the unified smiles and demands. The revolution is my child, our child, the child of all the Lebanese that are driven by the urgency to make change in their homeland, to bring forth an environment that their children can thrive in, can grow to find the purpose they seek.  Today, the child of the revolutionaries is almost a month old. The men and the women that birthed this child, hand-in-hand, have been celebrating its long-awaited presence every day. They have turned the Lebanese streets into the child’s home, making sure no one attempts to harm it. Everyone yet heads to the revolting streets carrying the responsibility of the child’s survival on their backs; and for the continuity of its life, many risked and sacrificed their own. Despite, at times, the doubt factor creeps into my thoughts through questions I never assumed I would ask myself, such as whether or not I have enough food, fuel, cash, or offline messaging applications in my reserve, but then the power of the child that has been brought to life by the revolutionaries settles my worries. These are historic times and I’m happy to be alive here and now.
