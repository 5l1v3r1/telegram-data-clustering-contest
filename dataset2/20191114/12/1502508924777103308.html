      <p>Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Thursday pitched for a separate ministry for promoting cooperatives in the country, saying they are effective institutions where people can find job opportunities.</p>
      <p>Currently, cooperatives come under the aegis of the Agriculture Ministry.</p>
      <p>"There is a need to form Ministry of Cooperatives so that cooperatives can develop as professional and effective institutions for playing an important role in socio-economic development of the country," Gangwar said at the inaugural function of 66th All India Cooperative Week organised by the National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI).</p>
      <p>Cooperatives are effective institutions where people can find opportunities for jobs. However, there is a need to rise above politics so that cooperatives can function professionally, he was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
      <p>Cooperatives can be the best institutions for welfare of women and backward classes of the society, he added.</p>
      <p>Gangwar further said the government is committed to the welfare of labour force in the country. The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/labour-ministry">Labour Ministry </a>has been giving priority to simplification of the labour laws.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, International Cooperative Alliance (Asia-Pacific Region) Regional Director Balu Iyer said aspirational youth are looking forward to cooperatives as a start-up, and they need to strengthen and professionalise themselves so that they not only provide job opportunities to youth but also make them entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>He further said that cooperatives can be the best institution for doubling farmers' income.</p>
      <p>Earlier, NCUI President Chandra Pal Singh Yadav said the government should support and strengthen cooperatives.</p>
      <p>Pointing out that India is the biggest cooperative movement in the world, he said cooperatives need to be provided tax relief at a time when corporates are given tax relief.</p>
      <p>"Cooperatives should not be discriminated in this regard", he added.</p>
