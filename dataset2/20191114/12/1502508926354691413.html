      <h1>China completes Mars lander test for 2020 mission to catch up with US</h1>

      <p>China on Thursday completed a test of its Mars exploration lander ahead of Beijing's first mission to the red planet slated for 2020.</p>
      <p>Beijing is pouring billions into its military-run space programme, with hopes of having a crewed space station by 2022.</p>
      <p>Thursday's hovering and obstacle avoidance test, which took place in Huailai, northern Hebei province, was conducted in a facility that simulated conditions on Mars.</p>
      <p>A red platform with steel cables attached mimicked the planet's gravity -- which is about a third that of Earth -- as the lander descended from a tall, metal structure.</p>
      <p>The test is "an important part" of China's plans to land on Mars, said Zhang Kejian, director of the China National Space Administration (CNSA).</p>
      <p>"Currently, all development work is going smoothly," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>China is pushing to catch up with the United States and become a space power, with ambitions of a manned lunar landing.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year it made the first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon, deploying a rover on the surface.</p>
      <p>China's first mission to Mars will focus on "orbiting and landing on Mars and perform a patrol survey on the surface," Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of China's Mars mission, said at Thursday's test.</p>
      <p>"After the probe is launched, it will take seven months to reach Mars," he added.</p>
      <p>The final landing process will only last about seven minutes, but is "the most difficult and the most challenging part of the whole mission".</p>
      <p>China now spends more on its civil and military space programmes than Russia and Japan, and is second only to the United States.</p>
      <p>Although opaque, its 2017 budget was estimated at USD 8.4 billion by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
