      <p>Gabriel Jesus and Roberto Firmino were on target as the Selecao defeated their bitter rivals 2-0 in Belo Horizonte to secure a place in the Copa America final on home soil.</p>
      <p>Argentina, who last won the tournament in 1993, had hit the crossbar in the first half through Sergio Aguero’s header, while Messi was struck the post.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the Barcelona playmaker accused the referee of bias. “The officiating was crazy,” the Argentina captain said. “He (the referee) was on their side. In every divided ball or dispute, he inclined the pitch their way.”</p>
