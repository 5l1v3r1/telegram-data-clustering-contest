      <p><b>Daniel Craig</b> (<i>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</i>, <i>Spectre</i>, <i>Logan Lucky</i>) plays Detective Benoit Blanc in the upcoming <b>Rian Johnson</b>-directed film <b><i>Knives Out</i></b>, an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit with an incredible all-star cast and a dark, hilarious script and storyline. In the clip below, Detective Blanc is questioned by Linda Drysdale (<b>Jamie Lee Curtis</b>), daughter of the late Harlan Thrombey (<b>Christopher Plummer</b>), about his motives in investigating her father’s death.</p>
      <p>The film also stars <b>Toni Collette</b>, <b>Chris Evans</b>, <b>Ana De Armas</b>, <b>Don Johnson</b>, <b>Noah Segan</b>, <b>Edi Patterson</b>, <b>Riki Lindhome</b>, <b>LaKeith Stanfield</b>, <b>Katherine Langford</b>, <b>Jaeden Martell</b>, and<b> Michael Shannon</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan’s dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan’s untimely death.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The whole film is filled with a dysfunctional family that each seems to harbor a dark secret, and no trust for anyone else. It looks wild and fun, and I can’t wait to see it! <i>Knives Out</i> hits theaters on November 27th, 2019.</p>
      <p>Check out the clip below, and let us know if you’re excited for the film.</p>
