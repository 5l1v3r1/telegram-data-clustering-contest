      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a P2,000 financial grant per month to members of the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) of the military.</h3>
      <p>Duterte signed Executive Order No. 94 on November 8, but it was only released to the media yesterday.</p>
      <p>Under the new EO, each qualified member of CAFGU would receive the financial grant starting July 1 this year.</p>
      <p>The financial grant covers only duly-appointed members of the CAFGU Active Auxiliary units “appearing in the roster maintained by the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) and actually rendering services.”</p>
      <p>Duterte said the funding requirements for the financial grant should be sourced from the current year’s available appropriation.</p>
      <p>He said the funding requirements for the succeeding years should be included in the annual General Appropriations Act.</p>
      <p>The President ordered the Department of Budget and Management and Department of National Defense to issue guidelines on the implementation of the EO, which took effect immediately.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Duterte granted each member of the CAFGU  financial support of P7,000 per month, covering the months of November and December.</p>
      <p>CAFGU was created through EO 264 in 1987 and mandated “to complement and support the regular forces of the AFP in dealing with internal and external security threats.”</p>
