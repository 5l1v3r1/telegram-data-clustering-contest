      <h1>Apple Releases Firmware Update for AirPods Pro</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:43:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Juli Clover</a></address>
      <p>Apple today released a new firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, which were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-airpods-pro-october-30/">originally released</a> on October 30. <br/><br/>Today's firmware update is labeled as 2B588, up from 2B584, which was the release version of the firmware that the ‌AirPods Pro‌ shipped with.</p>

      <p>There's no word on what's included in the firmware update, but it may improve connectivity or resolve other small issues with the earbuds. <br/><br/>The firmware update will install automatically when connecting the ‌AirPods Pro‌ to your iPhone or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and it could take some time for the update to become available for everyone. To check the firmware of your ‌AirPods Pro‌, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/update-airpods/">follow these steps</a>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch the Settings app on your iPhone, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/">iPod touch</a>, or ‌iPad‌.</li>
        <li>Tap General.</li>
        <li>Tap About.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to ‌AirPods Pro‌ and tap it.</li>
        <li>The firmware number is listed under "Firmware Version."</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There's no reliable way to force a firmware update on the ‌AirPods Pro‌, so ‌AirPods Pro‌ owners will need to be patient and expect the ‌AirPods Pro‌ to be updated over the course of regular use.</p>
