      <p>SURAT: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/shikhar-dhawan">Shikhar Dhawan</a> failed to score in his first game of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy as Delhi suffered a shock eight-wicket defeat at the hands of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a> for their first loss of the tournament.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nitish-Rana">Nitish Rana</a> took Delhi to 165 for seven with 55 off 30 balls, a quickfire innings that included half a dozen sixes. This was after Delhi decided to bat at the Patel International Stadium.</p>
      <p>Jammu and Kashmir made short of the 166-run target, racing to victory in 15.5 overs with eight wickets in hand. The flying start to the chase was provided by openers Shubham Khajuria (49 off 22) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jatin-Wadhawan">Jatin Wadhawan</a> (48 not out off 33) before <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Manzoor-Dar">Manzoor Dar</a> smashed 58 off 24 balls.</p>
      <p>It was the first loss for Delhi and first victory for Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Dar was picked up by IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2018 edition but did not get a game. The franchise eventually released him. With a blistering knock on Thursday, he is certain to attract some attention ahead of the IPL auctions next month.</p>
      <p>It was not an ideal start to the tournament for India opener Dhawan, who is not in the best of form. His stay in the middle lasted nine balls.</p>
      <p>In another Group E game, Gujarat thrashed Sikkim by nine wickets.</p>
