      <h1>The USPTO Wants To Know if Artificial Intelligence Can Own the Content it Creates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">msmash</a></address>
      <p>The US office responsible for patents and trademarks is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20961788/us-government-ai-copyright-patent-trademark-office-notice-artificial-intelligence">trying to figure out how AI might call for changes to copyright law</a>, and it's asking the public for opinions on the topic. From a report:<i> The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published a notice in the Federal Register last month saying it's seeking comments, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/uspto-questions-if-artificial-intelligence-can-create-or-infringe-copyrighted-works-191107/">spotted by <i>TorrentFreak</i></a>. The office is gathering information about the impact of artificial intelligence on copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights. It outlines thirteen specific questions, ranging from what happens if an AI creates a copyright-infringing work to if it's legal to feed an AI copyrighted material. It starts off by asking if output made by AI without any creative involvement from a human should qualify as a work of authorship that's protectable by US copyright law. If not, then what degree of human involvement "would or should be sufficient so that the work qualifies for copyright protection?" Other questions ask if the company that trains an AI should own the resulting work, and if it's okay to use copyrighted material to train an AI in the first place. "Should authors be recognized for this type of use of their works?" asks the office. "If so, how?"</i></p>
