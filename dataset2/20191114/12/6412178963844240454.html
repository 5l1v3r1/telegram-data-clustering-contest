        <b>The January 2020 transfer window for Premier League clubs will close at 11pm on Friday, January 31, it has been announced.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 2020 winter transfer period will open on New Year’s Day.</p>
      <p>The timings were confirmed at the top flight’s November shareholders’ meeting in central London on Thursday, attended by chairmen and chief executives of the 20 clubs.</p>
