      <p>With Black Friday right around the corner, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> has launched a deal for new subscribers: the first four months for 99 cents, if you sign up by January 6, 2020. The deal doesn’t apply to Amazon’s new <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/amazon-music-launched-hd-streaming-neil-young-approves/">Neil Young-approved HD Streaming service</a>, but it does cover the over 50 million songs available in standard definition (which, according to <i><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-music-unlimited-spotify-4-months">TechRadar</a></i>, is more than either Spotify or Apple Music offer). The price goes up to $9.99/month after the first four months, or $7.99/month if you’re a Prime subscriber.</p>
