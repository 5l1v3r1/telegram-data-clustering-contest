      <p>Massachusetts post-rockers <b>Caspian</b> recently announced a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-joanna-newsom-caspian-jesse-malin-aaron-west-more/">2020 West Coast tour</a>, which made it seem like something must be brewing in the land of Caspian, and something was indeed brewing. They’ve now announced their first album since 2015’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/caspian-share-d/"><i>Dust and Disquiet</i></a>, <i>On Circles</i>, which is due January 24 via Triple Crown (<a href="http://smarturl.it/caspiantheband">pre-order</a>).</p>
      <p>Guitarist/keyboardist Philip Jamieson says, “I’ve grown weary of reading about bands discuss the renewing, rehabilitative properties their most recent [album] has had on them. They incur corrosion, come close to running out of gas, descend into the dark abyss, and finally emerge on the other side with a record that has given them crystal clear perspective and a confident path forward. <i>On Circles</i> is <i>not</i> that record.”</p>
      <p>It was recorded by the great <b>Will Yip</b>, and the first single is “Flowers of Light,” which is one of Caspian’s more uplifting-sounding songs, and — as you’d expect from this band — it tugs at the heartstrings even without lyrics. Listen and watch the accompanying visualizer below. For a song that presumably does have lyrics, <b>Pianos Become the Teeth</b> frontman <b>Kyle Durfey</b> guests on the song “Nostalgist.”</p>
      <p>Caspian have also added Eastern North American tour dates to their 2020 schedule, including a NYC show on <b>April 8 at Le Poisson Rouge</b>. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/caspian/"><b>Tickets</b></a> for that show (and the whole tour) go on sale Friday (11/15) at 10 AM local. There’s also a <a href="https://www.caspian.band/">premium package for all dates</a> available now, that includes a ticket, exclusive patch and signed poster.</p>
      <p>This weekend, Caspian are playing two special hometown shows with the Losander Chamber Orchestra. All dates are listed below.</p>
