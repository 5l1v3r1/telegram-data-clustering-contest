      <h1>Emmerdale fans slam Jimmy's child abuse storyline as totally unbelievable</h1>
      <h2>They say it's 'idiotic'</h2>

      <p>Jimmy King has been unfairly accused of child abuse, and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> fans are furious about it.</p>
      <p>They've accused the plot of being unbelievable and full of holes - insisting Jimmy's hands are far too big to have caused the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-horrified-as-arthur-punches-archie-unconscious-and-blames-jimmy/">bruising on little Archie's arms</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Viewers know that Archie has been a victim to some disturbing abuse by Arthur, who sees him as a threat.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night (November 12), Arthur blamed Archie for 'ruining' his dad's birthday and turned nasty towards the young boy - punching him and knocking him to the floor.</p>
      <p>The nasty altercation came after Arthur told him no one missed his mum Rachel now that she was dead.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When Laurel and Jai found poor Archie on the floor, Arthur told them he'd fell by accident.</p>
      <p>But later, Jai and Laurel found more bruises on him.</p>
      <aside>If Jai and Laurel actually had a closer look at Archie's bruises, they'd clearly see the fingermarks are way too small to be Jimmy's. IDIOTS.</aside>
      <p>However, when they questioned Archie about how he got the marks, Arthur blurted out that Jimmy King was to blame!</p>

      <p>On Wednesday (November 13), Jai accused Jimmy of allowing things to get "fraught" and said: "Archie came back with some bruises. A little clutch of them on his arm."</p>
      <p>When Jimmy shrugged it off, saying "it'll be the usual rough and tumble, they're more like puppies than kids", Jai shot back: "I think it was more than that."</p>
      <p>"What are you saying?" asked Jimmy. "Are you seriously suggesting me?"</p>
      <p>Jai replied: "Laurel said I shouldn't, but... This is about my son. He is shy and sensitive and he needs me to protect him.</p>
      <p>"He didn't have a mark on him until he went to your house."</p>

      <p>But those watching from home made it clear they hated the way the storyline was going, saying Jimmy couldn't have caused the bruising, and saying he wouldn't hurt a fly.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "If Jai and Laurel actually had a closer look at Archie's bruises, they'd clearly see the fingermarks are way too small to be Jimmy's. IDIOTS."</p>
      <p>Another said: "The Emmerdale storyline where Arthur (a child) is blaming Jimmy (a grown man) for the handprint bruises he gave another little boy is ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"Surely Laurel and Jai can see that the bruises are too small for an adult's hands?!"</p>

      <p>A third seethed: "Arthur the tiny child and Jimmy the [bleep] massive bloke totally have the same sized hands #emmerdale."</p>
      <p>"What the hell? Arthur blamed someone like Jimmy, who couldn't even hurt a fly," said one more, while another added: "If they honestly believe Jimmy would hurt a child, they need their heads' read."</p>
      <p>One furious viewer tweeted: "Talk about clutching at straws, stupid storyline. Little child finger prints versus big 50-year-old finger prints.</p>
      <p>"Writers are bloody awful for this soap at the moment, no wonder all the actors are leaving."</p>
