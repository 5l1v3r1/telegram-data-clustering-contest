      <h2>All you need to know about the January transfer window dates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:55:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">Aidan McCartney, Connor O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window may still feel like a few months away but it will soon be here as teams look to add to their squads again.</p>
      <p>The transfer window for Premier League clubs shut for business on Thursday, August 8 just before the new season started although players could be sold to foreign clubs until the end of August.</p>
      <p>Trading will resume in the New Year with plenty of major transfers expected as Premier League sides look to prepare for the business end of the season.</p>
      <p>But when does the January window open and close? Here is the information you need to know as confirmed by the Premier League.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When does the January transfer window open?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Business will begin as the window opens on Wednesday, January 1, 2020 at midnight.</p>
      <p>While it is unlikely we will see many deals formally arranged before Wednesday, some could be announced on the first day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When does it close?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The window will close on Friday, January 31 2020 at 11pm, although we may see some deals completed after this deadline.</p>
      <p>Transfers can be completed after the deadline as long as all the necessary paperwork is submitted in time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who can play on January 1?</b>
      </p>
      <p>New players signed on 1-2 January will not be eligible for Matchweek 21 it has been confirmed. However they can be made available for the following games with clubs permitted to make changes to their squad lists throughout the January window.</p>
      <p>The league has announced: “Clubs completing deals late on Deadline Day, 31 January, will be able to submit a Deal Sheet between 21:00-23:00 GMT.</p>
      <p>“Clubs will have until midnight on Deadline Day to complete the information needed by FIFA's Transfer Matching System to apply for international clearance for new signings.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>When is the deadline for squad lists?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deadline will be 14.00 GMT on Wednesday February 20th.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What about the loan window for signings?</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the start of the 2016/17 campaign, FIFA introduced new rules which mean that the emergency loan window would no longer exist.</p>
      <p>Free agents are permitted to join clubs outside the window while there is dispensation should clubs suffer a goalkeeping crisis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How many loan players can a club have?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Championship and EFL clubs are allowed to have eight players on loan, but can only pick a maximum of five loanees in their match day squad.</p>
      <p>They can only sign a maximum of four players from a specific club, of which only two can be over the age of 23.</p>
      <p>To quote the EFL: "A maximum of five players registered on a temporary loan transfer can be named in the players listed on a team sheet for any individual match played under the auspices of the league.</p>
      <p>"This maximum shall reduce to four players where a club names a player on the team sheet who is registered on an emergency goalkeeper loan."</p>
