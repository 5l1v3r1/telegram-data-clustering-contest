      <p>I’ve been a long time fan and pretty vocal supporter of the Nvidia Shield range over the years. Actually, that’s true of a few of us here at eTeknix! I loved the Shield Portable from six years ago and maybe <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/best-games-to-play-while-sitting-on-the-loo-with-nvidia-shield/">loved it a little too much</a>. It <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/can-you-really-use-the-nvidia-shield-as-a-desktop/">got used as a PC</a>, it got <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/is-emulation-the-best-feature-of-the-nvidia-shield/">used as an on-the-go emulator</a>. Then we got the amazing <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-shield-tablet-android-5-0-lollipop-review/">Nvidia Shield Tablet</a>, which I still use to this day to stream PC games, and on our long business trips around the world… So I can play PS1 games on the way. Plus, we at eTeknix have had a few of the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-shield-android-tv-review/">original Shield TV units</a> and the more modern <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-shield-tv-2017-model-android-tv-console-review/">2017 Edition Shield TV</a> deployed around the office for daily use. So, when I say that I’ve been looking forward to the new 2019 editions of the Nvidia Shield TV, you know I really mean it.</p>

      <h3>Nvidia Shield TV 2019 Edition</h3>
      <p>There aren’t a lot of big changes between the old ones and the new ones. There’s the “standard” version that we have today, and there’s the Pro version; which I’m sure we’ll get to soon enough. The big hitters this time though as Dolby Vision HDR support, something sorely lacking on the previous models. Keep in mind Dolby Vision needs a chipset, and can’t be done purely with a software update, so it’s nice to see this addressed. The new Tegra X1+ SOC gives it a performance bump, using the same chip as the newer Nintendo Switch models and Switch Lite, so we know it has some decent chops. All they’ve done is go from 20nm to 16nm but it’s basically still the same Maxwell GPU as before. That being said, it still makes it the most powerful device in its class.</p>

      <h3>What’s in the Box?</h3>
      <p>The box is pretty compact, about the size you would expect for a large mobile phone. Inside, you’ll find the remote and the Shield TV mounted with protective foam. Behind that, a power cable and quick start guide, and that’s about it. There’s no HDMI cable, which seems a bit odd, as it’s absolutely essential for use. Thankfully I’ve got about 20 of them in a box somewhere, but others may not.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164706-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>A Closer Look</h3>
      <p>The unit its self is a bit of a strange-looking thing. It’s a tube, so it’ll roll around if you put it on your desktop. It’s got a good weight to it too, and the overall construction feels pretty solid.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164750-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It does stand on one end, but honestly, it’s not meant to. You aren’t meant to have this one out on show. It’s designed to be dumped behind you TV stand with all your cables and plugs where nobody will see it. It’s a strange approach to take, but honestly, it’s not a terrible idea either. The less stuff you have on your TV stand, well, it’s one less thing to dust as far as I’m concerned.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164809-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On one end, you’ll find a master power button, the HDMI port, and the SD card slot.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164814-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On the otherwise, the RJ45 and power connector. That’s it, it doesn’t have any big RGB lights, no big control surfaces, it just lives between the cables and gets on with it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164821-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s obviously bigger than an HDMI dongle, but it’s still much smaller than the Shield TV’s we’ve seen before. It is a supersize-dongle-hide-it-somewhere-thingybob!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164837-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Remote</h3>
      <p>The new remote is looking fantastic though. IT’s a much chunkier affair this time, so it’s much more comfortable to hold. Plus, they’ve solved the issue of the crap internal battery failure from before; it just takes two AAA batteries now, huzzah!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164858-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It has a nice weight to it and a lightly textured coating that makes it easy to hold. There’s a big and rather blatant Netflix button right at the bottom.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164925-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus, you get this nice D-Pad and OK button setup here. However, you can customise the functions of the buttons a wee bit too if you really need to. Right, let’s plug it all in and go watch some TV… It’s a tough job, but someone has to do it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112_164935-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
      <p>Here you can see the original Shield TV and the new one right next to it. This is a lot smaller, but it’s a very different shape too. Because the cables stick out the ends, it’s not really suitable to have on show. For me, I’d tuck this in the gap behind my centre speaker and forget it was there; simple!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_093443-880x561.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Power up the system and it’s all pretty straight forward from there. I’ll no doubt tell you that there is a new firmware, so just OK that and leave it to do its thing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_094227-880x718.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_094239-880x703.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Dolby Vision</h3>
      <p>Now, let’s not muck about here, this isn’t a full review of the Shield TV, because we’ve done that several times before. It’s pretty much the same as it was before. However, there are a few new features, such as the inclusion of Dolby Vision HDR. Because my TV does support Dolby Vision, it auto-detected it and notified me to enable it. Of course, I said yes!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_094915-880x567.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Dolby Atmos/DTS:X</h3>
      <p>I may have my two big floor standing speakers and centre at the front, but I’m flanked by a full 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos setup here, so that means I can really unleash all the processing the Nvidia Shield TV can offer me.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_094940-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095246-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Take note though, it defaults to 60 FPS mode. You’ll want to enable auto-resolution switching in software like Plex, or configure the output using the Shield TV menus to ensure you can watch true 24 frame movies correctly.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095305-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>AI Upscaling</h3>
      <p>One of the big new features here is AI upscaling. It’s no good for 4K content, as that’ll already be native on your 4K screen. However, for content that is 1080p and below, it’s a pretty cool thing to have. Now, I’ve tried it out, and the results are certainly subjective.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095418-880x557.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>What’s cool is that you can basically choose how aggressive you need it to be. Leaving it on a toggle between basic and AI-Enhanced with medium force seemed to be the sweet spot. It turns its self off on content that doesn’t need scaling. However, for lousy quality YouTube videos and not 4K Netflix or stuff on Plex, it worked great. I heard people saying “it doesn’t work on Plex” but I can tell you now, it absolutely does.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095430-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I watched a bit of Avatar (1080p) and what I notice most of all was the background detail. It was like enabling higher anisotropic filtering and sharpening, kinda like what we see with Nvidia Ansel Detail Filter.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_100308-880x530.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Enthusiast Ready</h3>
      <p>What I do love is that it has such broad support for modern TVs. I know that’s like… well, duh! But seriously, there are a lot of cheap TV boxes and dongles out there that simply don’t have a full range to them. You’ve got multiple colours spaces, multiple HDR formats, and more here. This ensures it’ll work on older TVs, as well as getting the best out of high-end models; especially now that Dolby Vision is finally added.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095509-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Thanks to the HDMI pass-through of audio, you can ensure you get the most from your AV receiver too. Now, I leave mine on Auto, and it’ll select Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, or whatever is needed. However, if your amplifier, soundbar or TV has a limitation, you can set that standard here and lock it in.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095615-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_095623-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I gave it a quick test with some hi-res audio FLAC files, and just like the old Shield TV, there was no issue passing this through to my amplifier.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_100657-880x553.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Netflix</h3>
      <p>A few applications will support both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. However, thanks to the big “Netflix” button on the remote, this one was the obvious place to start. Netflix has done a lot of work to push both Dolby Vision and Atmos, especially on a lot of their exclusive and original content. Stranger Things offers up Dolby Vision, although it will work on the HDR10 protocol or SDR if required.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_100952-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>StarTrek is another one, I honestly think this show looks off somehow using HDR10. However, the colour grading works really well in Dolby Vision, so well worth checking out again if you haven’t seen it rocking DV.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_101032-880x584.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>However, for those of you with a more advanced home theatre setup, you’ll be looking for the double badge. If it says “VISION ATMOS” then you can enjoy both Dolby Vision and Atmos. The Shield TV had no issues pumping this through to my TV and Amp. Of course, the speakers and panel you have will need to have those features, if they don’t, you won’t see that badge here.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_101047-880x522.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Unlike the Xbox One, it’ll auto-switch correctly from SDR to HDR modes. Hence why I only use the Xbox Netflix app for HDR content, as it sucks for SDR and tries to map the colour space. The Shield TV on the other hand delivers everything as intended.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_102441-880x514.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Oh, the Dark Crystal series is Atmos and Vision enabled? Well, it’s at this point I took a nice long break from “testing” because, why wouldn’t you!?</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191114_102627-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>GameSteam</h3>
      <p>Honestly, I’m not going to dive into all of this as I normally would. The Nvidia Geforce Now, GameStream and Android gaming features have been covered extensively by us here at eTeknix over the years. YouTube is available in 4K as before, you can use Google Assistant to control your smart home and find TV shows to watch. All these features and here and they’re all doing what they do. Just remember, for GameSteam, you need a PC in the house with a compatible Nvidia GPU.</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>The Nvidia Shield TV 2019 Edition is available now for a very reasonable <a href="https://amzn.to/2Knbpb4">£149.99</a>. That makes it the most affordable release of the Shield TV to date! It launches alongside the Shield TV Pro, which we haven’t tested yet, but that model is available for just <a href="https://amzn.to/352bkBD">£199.99</a>.</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Since the team at Nvidia last updated the Nvidia Shield TV in 2017, very little has changed. However, a few little changes here and there can add up in a big way, and they certainly have here today. I love my Shield TV, it’s the entertainment hub we use for almost all of our viewing at home and in the office. However, it was lacking a minor detail that has now been addressed; Dolby Vision.</p>
      <h3>Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos</h3>
      <p>I love my Dolby Atmos setup, and it’s worked great for me on my original Shield TV setup. However, my TV also has Dolby Vision, a flagship format of HDR that offers scene by scene adjustments to ensure the best picture quality. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use this feature until now without resorting to a 4K Blu-Ray disc. Thankfully, I can now watch all the flagship content on apps like Netflix as it was intended. I’m sure there are a fair few home cinema enthusiasts and consumers in general who are thankful to see this update.</p>
      <h3>Should I Update?</h3>
      <p>Honestly, unless you REALLY want Dolby Vision working, no. I mean, if this was to be your first Nvidia Shield TV then buy the new one. It’s more compact, it’s cheaper, the remote is VASTLY superior to the old one, and the AI Upscaling is pretty neat too. I will be updating mine because I do want those features, but beyond that, it’s still the Shield TV we’ve known and loved for a few years now.</p>
      <h3>Familiar</h3>
      <p>Using the device doesn’t feel any different to me. It’s still got lag-free navigation, it can still handle 4K GameSteam, 4K movies, and anything else I throw at it with ease. It was the best smart TV box before, and it still is. I’m eager to get my hands on the pro one, but for £149.99, the new smart TV in a can form factor model is a pretty sweet deal.</p>
