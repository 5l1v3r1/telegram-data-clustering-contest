      <h1>Crypto Exchange OKEx Launches Bitcoin Futures Margined With Tether</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:49:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has launched Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) futures contracts that are margined with the Tether (USDT) stablecoin. OKEx <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usdt-margined-futures-live-on-okex-300958231.html">announced</a> the new offering in a press release on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>OKEx first <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/okex-to-launch-usdt-futures-trading-with-up-to-100x-leverage">announced</a> its intention to launch USDT-settled futures trading with up to 100x leverage at the end of October. Now, after conducting a simulation that began on Nov. 5, the exchange listed the BTC/USDT offering on its trading platform.</p>
      <p>The exchange previously said that offering a stablecoin-based derivatives contract will make it simpler and more efficient for traders to navigate the market and calculate risk. OKEx CEO Jay Hao commented:</p>
      <blockquote>“The simulation of our USDT Futures Contract was very successful, and we received positive feedback from traders in the OKEx community.”</blockquote>
      <p>The derivative in question is quoted and settled in USDT and each BTC/USDT contract has a face value of 0.0001 BTC and has an available value range of 0.01 to 100 times. The platform’s users can take both long and short positions on the contract.</p>
      <h3>More assets to come</h3>
      <p>In the future, OKEx will also launch USDT-margined futures for other crypto assets. More precisely, the firm announced plans to launch such contracts for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index">EOS</a>, Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>), Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, Ethereum Classic (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/etc-price-index">ETC</a>), Tron (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tron-price-index">TRX</a>), and Bitcoin SV (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bsv-price-index">BSV</a>).</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-plans-to-roll-out-cash-settled-bitcoin-futures-contract">reported</a> yesterday, Bakkt announced that its Bitcoin futures trading on the Intercontinental Exchange will expand to include a cash-settled option.</p>
