      <h1>Vikrant Massey has the sweetest thing to say about Deepika Padukone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:07:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.filmfare.com/search/author_Filmfare" target="_blank">Filmfare</a></address>
      <p>Coming together on the big screen for the first time are Vikrant Massey and Deepika Padukone who will be seen in Meghna Gulzar directorial Chhapaak. Based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal, the film features Deepika playing the lead and Vikrant as her love interest in the film. Anticipated to be one of the biggest films next year, Chhapaak is slated to hit the screens on January 10, 2020.</p>
      <p>Opening up about the experience of working with Deepika in the film, Vikrant said in an interview recently that she’s one of the finest actors in the Hindi cinema to work with. He told, “It was great working with her. I have always said this that she is one of the finest co-actors I have worked with in my career. I really had a nice experience working on the film. We have completed the shooting and it is to release in two months' time, so, I am keeping my fingers crossed.”</p>

      <p>It’s with this film that Deepika is turning a producer in collaboration with Fox Star Studios. Speaking of the film’s trailer, the latest we hear is that makers of the film plan to drop it in the first week of December. What makes this film a lot more special is the fact that other than Deepika fans, various acid attack survivors are also eagerly waiting for the film. For the unversed, Chhapaak will be clashing with Ajay Devgn’s period drama Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.</p>
