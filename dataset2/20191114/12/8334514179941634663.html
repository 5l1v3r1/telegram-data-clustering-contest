      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s bank staff union called on Thursday for employees to stay on strike until it receives details of a security plan, especially on how to deal with customers.</p>
      <p>The union called for the strike over safety fears, as protests against political leaders sweep Lebanon and depositors demand access to their money after banks imposed new curbs.</p>
      <p>George al-Hajj, president of the Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees, told Reuters the strike, which has shut banks across the country this week, would continue on Friday.</p>
