      <h1>How police caught man who snatched a child from Nottingham and flew to Madrid</h1>
      <h2>A man and an accomplice were today jailed for their actions which saw a woman bound and gagged for seven hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:45:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Sherdley</a></address>
      <p>With just seconds to spare after a flight had been cleared for take-off from Madrid, Spanish authorities swooped on a plane with a young child on board with an abductor.</p>
      <p>Officials boarded and found the infant safe and well after working against the clock.</p>
      <p>The story is a rare one faced by police in Nottinghamshire where their investigation all began in a house in the city.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, November 14, a 45-year-old man was jailed for 15 years with an extended licence period of three years. A 43-year-old woman - his accomplice - was jailed for seven years.</p>
      <p>They pleaded guilty to abduction of a child, making threats to kill, false imprisonment and having an imitation firearm.</p>
      <p>Nottingham Crown Court heard how the child - who cannot be identified - was taken from the house by the man after he climbed in through a window in the early hours.</p>
      <p>After clambering into the ground-floor room, he threatened a woman who had been asleep with a fake gun. She was bound and gagged, leaving the man clear to make his getaway more than 1,000 miles to Madrid.</p>
      <p>His accomplice, another woman, waited more around seven hours before alerting police. Initially, she posed as a victim in the abduction, claiming she had acted under duress at the hands of the man.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">Detective Chief Inspector</a> Pete Quinn, of the force's public protection team, told in an interview with Nottinghamshire Live how she was lying through her teeth.</p>

      <p>"She directed officers to an adult female who was still tied and bound on a bed; masking tape around her mouth, tie ropes around her wrists and rope around her ankles. She was in significant distress.</p>
      <p>"She had been asleep in bed and the child had been sleeping. No one else was there. The man climbed through a ground-floor window and then threatened her (the woman with the child), while she was in the bed, with an imitation firearm, then she was restrained and the child was removed".</p>
      <p>The accomplice called 999 at 10.55am on Thursday, August 1, this year, raising concerns for the welfare of a child.</p>
      <p>Police went to the scene and untied the woman who had been held captive, and she was taken to hospital as a precaution.</p>

      <p>DCI Quinn recalls how she bravely spoke about what had happened and it all "unravelled quite quickly". The accomplice had been involved in tying her up and she was directed by her co-accused not to contact police before 11am.</p>
      <p>A deliberate plan, says DCI Quinn, so that the man - someone he describes as "nothing other than a callous, selfish criminal" - was in the air with the child and out of reach of the law when police were first alerted.</p>
      <p>"It was always, quite frankly, a flawed plan in many ways," he says. "It relied on the police believing her story. Had it not unravelled as quickly as it had, it might have built in a delay".</p>
      <p>There was possibility that interviews may have delayed things but the police were well ahead of the man and woman, who cannot be identified.</p>
      <p>"Capturing him was a secondary objective, because the child was the priority," says DCI Quinn.</p>

      <p>Through border agencies, police confirmed the man's flight with the child to Madrid and his plan to board a second flight to Algeria.</p>
      <p>"It is absolutely a race against time. One, we have got this young child and we don't know what that man's intention is with the child. We don't know if he is seeking to harm the child.</p>
      <p>"We are satisfied, as we are working, he Is in the air between London and Madrid. We had a reasonable idea what bit of the sea he is at. We know he is going to get a connecting flight to Algeria. If he gets on that flight, our chances of having him detained and locating that child safe would be reduced.</p>
      <p>"With every hour that passed, in my view, the risk to the child increased".</p>

      <p>The force in Nottingham had to meet certain protocols before Spanish authorities could move in. They had to circulate the suspect as internationally wanted and were reliant on the support from the National Crime Agency and Interpol.</p>
      <p>DCI Quinn explained: "My officers were doing the paperwork to ensure he is circulated as 'internationally wanted', while also on the phone to the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">CPS</a> pre-warning them. Spanish authorities needed to be satisfied international protocols should be observed. We managed to get that done."</p>
      <p>By the time the suspect and the child disembarked and boarded the connecting flight to Algeria, Spanish authorities entered the plane and found the child - who is now safe - and the man.</p>
      <p>"It was a close-run thing," recalls DCI Quinn. "We were concerned that if the plane took off with the child, that out chances of apprehending him would be reduced. A<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime"> European arrest warrant</a> would not have counted in Algeria. It would have become a far more complex investigation."</p>

      <p>The CPS authorised charges, so police could apply for the arrest warrant, a practice that would normally take several weeks and not an afternoon.</p>
      <p>A senior CPS prosecutor went to Oxclose Police Station and police presented their case after an intensive day of work. Once they got their warrant, officers flew to Madrid to collect the man after the CPS liaised with prosecutors in Spain and for a judge there to grant the man's extradition.</p>
      <p>DCI Quinn stressed the abduction was targeted, premeditated and planned.</p>

      <p>"I don't think they intended to harm the child. I think they were reckless. I condemn their actions. There were lots of opportunities to change their minds and withdraw from this and, I have no doubt, to cause someone to have a life-changing experience. I don't think they had any regard for the trauma inflicted on the victim. Their actions were terrible".</p>
