      <h1>NAWOJ wants media to monitor, expose incidences of abuse against girl-child</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:54:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>National Association of Women Journalists called on the media to monitor and expose incidences of abuse and all forms of violence against the girl child.</p>
      <p>The call is in a communique signed by the association’s National President, Ifeyinwa Omowole, issued at the end of a one-day workshop to mark “NAWOJ at 30”  in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The association identified sexual harassment, rape and violence against minors, as well as poor representation of women in politics as factors that militate against the development of the girl child.</p>
      <p>It also listed poverty, parental negligence, negative influence of social media, indecent dressing, as well as posting to cover assignments at odd places and at odd times as factors that could promote sexual violence or rape on minors and women.</p>
      <p>The association observed that culture, religion, insecurity, the lack of adequate finance, the lack of level playing field and intimidation are other factors affecting women from active participation in politics.</p>
      <p>The association noted that “the media should continue to report on the importance of girl child education and ensure effective monitoring of laws that affect the girl child”.</p>
      <p>It added: “The media should also continue to write reports on issues of girl child education, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, insurgency</p>
      <p>and cultural barriers, as well as issues that contribute to high rate of school dropout by girls.”</p>
      <p>NAWOJ, therefore, resolved that existing laws relating to child rights, violence against persons, prohibition act should be reviewed, and stringent measures meted out on perpetrators.</p>
      <p>It stated:  “Sex education should be included in the school curriculum” and urged women to seek elective positions in politics.</p>
      <p>“Women should strive toward unity of purpose to achieve greater heights.</p>
      <p>“Older women are encouraged to be role models and mentors to younger women to bridge generational gaps.”</p>
      <p>NAN reports that 260 journalists, including men and women, attended the workshop on gender based issues, organised by NAWOJ in Abuja.</p>
