      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:00:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>Google has built a new artificial intelligence-powered singing meter called ‘FreddieMeter.’</p>
      <p>The FreddieMeter is able to see how closely Freddie Mercury fans can get their voice to sound like the late lead vocalist of Queen.</p>
      <p>Google created the project in partnership with Queen, Universal Music Group and Hollywood Records. FreddieMeter is being released in support of the Mercury Phoenix Trust, a charity started by band members Brian May, Roger Taylor and Jim Beach to raise awareness and funds for the fight against HIV/AIDS. The FreddieMeter is launching in honour of Queen’s first-ever live performance of <i>Bohemian Rhapsody </i>44 years ago.</p>
      <p>FreddieMeter will show users how close their voices match Mercury’s as it analyzes their pitch, timbre and melody to determine a score of 0 to 100.</p>
      <p>You can pick one of four Queen songs: <i>Bohemian Rhapsody, Somebody to Love, We Are The Champions </i>and <i>Don’t Stop Me Now. </i>Following that, you’ll get a score that you can share directly from your device to YouTube and other social media platforms. To compete in the challenge, use the hashtag #FreddieChallenge on your social channels and tag three friends. Lastly, encourage people to donate, to the <a href="http://www.mercuryphoenixtrust.com/donate">Mercury Phoenix Trust.</a></p>
      <p>The Google Creative Lab and Google Research created FreddieMeter by using on-device machine learning. Google trained the meter based on Mercury’s isolated vocals as well as people trying to sing like the late artist.</p>
      <p>FreddieMeter works on desktop, Android and iPhone devices. Google says the audio doesn’t get uploaded to any servers and that it stays completely local until the user shares it.</p>
      <p>Recently, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> received one billion views on YouTube, which coincided with the launch of the HD remastered version of the video. According to Google, this is the first pre-1990s video to reach this milestone on the platform.</p>
