      <h1>Disrupting the disruptor: Disney+ signs up 10 million in day</h1>

      <p>Walt Disney Co.'s new streaming television service Disney+ got off to a roaring start by signing up 10 million subscribers on its first day, the company announced Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Disney said in a statement it has seen "extraordinary consumer demand" and "has already reached a major milestone, achieving a remarkable 10 million sign-ups since launching."</p>
      <p>The news comes despite a launch marred by glitches that prevented many customers accessing titles from Mickey Mouse cartoons to Star Wars.</p>
      <p>Disney+ marks a huge bet by the media-entertainment giant, pitching it into direct conflict with on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime which have disrupted the Hollywood media landscape.</p>
      <p>It went live Tuesday across the US, Canada and Netherlands, featuring thousands of movies and TV episodes from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and National Geographic.</p>
      <p>Disney chief Bob Iger called the launch "a historic moment for our company that marks a new era of innovation and creativity."</p>

        <b>'Jaw dropping' </b>
      </p>
      <p>Daniel Ives at Wedbush Securities described the 10 million subscriptions as "jaw dropping" and "considerably higher than we and many on the Street were anticipating."</p>
      <p>Ives said in a research note that Disney appears to be "coming out of the gate with unmatched content and a massive brand/distribution that makes the House of Mouse a legitimate streaming competitor on Day One to Netflix," and that it suggests the company could hit its target of 60 million to 90 million subscribers ahead of its 2024 target.</p>
      <p>The Disney+ launch comes less than two weeks after Apple began its well-financed Apple+ TV service, and ahead of rival offerings from AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia and Comcast's NBCUniversal, with each seeking to chip away at the customer base of Netflix and Amazon.</p>
      <p>Richard Windsor, analyst at Radio Free Mobile, said the technical problems with Disney+ were "a good sign because it implies that the demand for the unique catalog that it has to offer is stronger than expected, putting it in a very strong position long-term."</p>
      <p>Windsor said the market is fluid now with the entry of new players but that deep-pocketed players such as Disney, Apple and Amazon "will end up acquiring many of the weaker players" and cut into Netflix's large user base.</p>
      <p>Ives said Apple has a chance to gain ground by reaching its customer base of 900 million people who use iPhones, despite having only a handful of original shows at launch.</p>
      <p>He said Disney "has a whole other strategy as the company has a content library that is unmatched with a global consumer base that will be tapped through its theme parks and other vast distribution tentacles."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Late-night 'Star Wars' </b>
      </p>
      <p>On the Disney+ launch day, excited fans had stayed up until the small hours to be among the first to watch "The Mandalorian," a new live-action Star Wars television series which is among a handful of exclusives available at launch.</p>
      <p>In early reviews, the Los Angeles Times called the first episode "safe-but-entertaining," describing it as "long on impressive special effects and alien shootouts, and short on a fresh story line."</p>
      <p>Vanity Fair praised the pilot's action sequences but found the show "lacking the achingly human element of the 'Star Wars' universe."</p>
      <p>For Disney, the strategy of going directly to consumers means it will forgo an estimated $5 billion in revenues from streaming rights deals from other services.</p>
      <p>Disney is undercutting most rivals with a monthly price of $6.99, or $12.99 packaged with Hulu and its sports service ESPN+.</p>
