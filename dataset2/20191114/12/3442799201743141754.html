      <h1>HomeRun Adds Thousands of Icons for Customizing Your Watch HomeKit Triggers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:35:53+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/ryanchristoffel/" target="_blank">Ryan Christoffel</a></address>
      <p>Customization options have never hurt an app, and in many cases they make apps far more functional and endearing. Today <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homerun-for-homekit/id1367842592?uo=4">HomeRun</a>, the Apple Watch app for running HomeKit scenes, has expanded its customization options immensely by adding over 4,400 new icons that can be used for configuring the app’s grid of HomeKit scenes, and also for adorning your watch face via HomeRun’s complications.</p>
      <p>HomeRun <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/homerun-quickly-trigger-homekit-scenes-on-your-apple-watch/">debuted last November</a> as the best option for running HomeKit scenes from your Apple Watch. Unlike Apple’s own Home app, which only displays two scene triggers on-screen at once, with HomeRun you can fit up to 12 on-screen with a 44mm Watch, plus <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/homerun-11-enables-creating-custom-watch-complications/">create complications</a> for those scenes that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/homerun-launches-advanced-daily-routine-feature-for-complications-and-siri-face/">run on a user-set schedule</a>, so the right scene complication is always present at the right time.</p>

      <p>Previous releases enabled customizing HomeRun’s scene grid, which makes up the app’s main UI, by choosing from different colors and glyphs for each of your HomeKit scenes. The number of options was fine before, but now it’s much more than fine. Developer Aaron Pearce has added thousands of new icons by including the full set of Apple’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/4/#sf-symbols">SF Symbols</a>, the full set of <a href="https://www.simpaticons.com/">Simpaticons</a>, plus emoji options. The over 4,400 icons can be browsed inside HomeRun’s companion iPhone app, where a search option has thankfully been included.</p>
      <p>I love that these new options work not only inside HomeRun’s grid, but also for configured complications. The sole exception is emoji, since they don’t fit watchOS’ design standards for complications. That slight drawback aside, this is a fantastic release for HomeRun that ensures I have no reason to ever look elsewhere for HomeKit scene control on the Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>HomeRun 1.3 is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/homerun-for-homekit/id1367842592?uo=4">available now on the App Store</a>.</p>
