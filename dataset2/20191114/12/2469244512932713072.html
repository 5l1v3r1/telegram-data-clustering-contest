      <p>Established in 1990, The Eastern Eye is described as the original contemporary Indian restaurant, responsible for re-defining quintessential Indian cuisine by bringing together authentic flavours, reflecting traditional recipes using innovative techniques, with world-class presentation.</p>
      <p>It claims to have created an exciting range of menus and palate pleasing dishes to please all with a focus on quality since day one.</p>
      <p>The restaurant even welcomes customers to visit its kitchen to inspect the quality of hygiene and preparations. <br/><br/>In August it was announced the restaurant had made the final of the English Curry Awards 2019. With a rating of 4/5 on Trip Advisor, it was the only restaurant from Devon to make the final.</p>
      <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of the British Curry Awards.</p>
      <p>The process of public nominations creates an authentic list of the nation’s favourite Asian eateries, based on the opinions of local residents, leading to a rigorous vetting process by an independent panel of judges.</p>
      <p>British Curry Awards Founder, Enam Ali MBE, said: “I am so very grateful to local curry restaurant diners who, every year, take the effort to nominate their favourite restaurants for the British Curry Awards, and who provide us with their vital feedback, letting us know about the best service, the best curry cuisine and other factors for consideration.</p>
      <p>"Only with their feedback can their local restaurants also continue to optimise quality of the service they provide. It is the opinions and feedback of local diners that is paramount, and of far more significance that a critic’s review or a Michelin star rating."</p>
