      <p>Dark Mode for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>has been in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/companies-news-1010101.htm">news </a>for long but the feature may debut sooner on the messasing app starting with the iOS users.</p>
      <p>The iPhone users will be able to run this feature on iOS 13 and the icons in dark mode are in blue and grey colour schemes, according to WABetaInfo, a fan website that tracks <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>updates.</p>
      <p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>is also testing a new beta update for iOS users which would bring features like hide muted status update, splash screen and app badge improvements, among others.</p>
      <p>WhatsApp's new splash screen would essentially let users see the WhatsApp logo whenever they open the app on their iPhones. This is also available on the Android beta app.</p>
      <p>Last week, WhatsApp has added a new privacy setting, which will let users decide whether they want to join a group on the messaging platform or not.</p>
      <p>To enable it, users need to go to "Settings" in the app, then tap Account, Privacy and Groups and select one of three options: "Everyone," "My Contacts," or "My Contacts Except."</p>
