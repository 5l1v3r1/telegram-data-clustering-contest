      <p>Samuel Umtiti was not included on the squad list for Barca's game at Cartagena, even though he is not in the France squad.</p>
      <p>Him missing out is nothing new. Since he played 90 minutes aganst Leganes last season, Samu has been in a diabolical dynamic. He has not played two consecutive matches in the 68 since then.</p>
      <p>The club did not like how he managed his knee problem, forcing himself to play at the Russia 2018 World Cup, which has had negative effects on his career since.</p>
      <p>Valverde left out Umtiti from the Cartagena squad list because they are taking extreme caution with him. They don't want him to be the new Vermaelen.</p>
      <p>After two excellent campaigns, his knee problem flared up. The medics recommended surgery and recovery but he took conservative treatment so he could feature in Russia.</p>
      <p>Umtiti returned with the World Cup under his arm but the knee messed up. On Sep 26 he played 90 against Leganes then disappeared for nine games, coming back to face Atletico, before missing 19 more matches.</p>
      <p>On Feb 19 he was on the bench against Lyon, then played 90 against Sevilla, before resting two games. After that he plays 90 then is out for two or three matches.</p>
      <p>The unhappiness at the club increased when Umtiti says he doesn't regret his decision, despite the negative effects. Barca signed him up to a big deal at the start of June 2018, but it has not worked out.</p>
      <p>A year later they wanted to sell him but his physical problems and new high salary stopped any deal going ahead.</p>

      <p>The reality is that Pique-Lenglet is the first choice pair, but Umtiti is still a useful back up. Todibo is considered too young.</p>
      <p>Umtiti played 90 mins against Eibar, but then was out again. He played against Celta Vigo too, and may next reappear against Dortmund on No 27. That game Pique is suspended, so Barca need Samu fit.</p>
