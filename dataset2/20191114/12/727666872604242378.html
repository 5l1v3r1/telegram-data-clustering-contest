      <p>It looks like Fiddy wants to lead President Xi Jinping's digital infantry.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Apparently, China has an army of paid trolls to disrupt conversations on the country's social media platforms. The network of commentators, known as the 50 Cent Party for the rumored payment amount per post, purposely pushes positive information about the government.</p>
      <p>China allegedlyÂ concocts about 448 million social media comments a year. AnÂ <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/trolling-by-distraction/514589/"><i>American Political Science Review </i>paper</a> concludes,Â "If these estimates are correct, a large proportion of government web site comments, and about one of every 178 social media posts on commercial sites, are fabricated by the government."</p>
      <p>After discoveringÂ China's 50 Cent Party, one of America's most well-known internet trolls expressed interest in finding theÂ propaganda squad. Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson tweeted about the communist nation's likelyÂ 2 million-strong "strategic distraction" operation.</p>
      <p>"What is this sh*t, Iâ€™m trying to find my army. ðŸ¤”," tweeted Jackson. He later added, "ðŸ‘€do I have to go to China to find my Army ðŸ˜’I just want to be apart of it. LOL."</p>
      <p>For years, 50 Cent has used his social media accounts to take aim at his rivals such as Ja Rule, Wendy Williams, Bow Wow, and Young Buck. However, the G-Unit leader's Instagram page was recently deactivated.</p>
