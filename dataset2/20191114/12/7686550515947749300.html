      <p>Warren Gatland has admitted he had suspicions about a Wales player doping during his 12-year reign as national head coach.</p>
      <p>Gatland, who left the post after the Rugby World Cup, admitted he had suspicions about a Wales player based on jokes made by teammates, but later clarified he had no evidence to base any suspicion on.</p>
      <p>The identity of the player the Kiwi was referring to is unknown.</p>
      <p>Gatland made the revelation while speaking to <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/rugby/maybe-one-gatland-welsh-player-doping-924838">Off The Ball</a> presenter Joe Molloy on Wednesday night, while discussing doping in the sport.</p>
      <p>Gatland said: "You know I haven’t come across, personally, any players that I've coached from a Wales perspective that I would - well sorry, maybe one."</p>
      <p>Asked if he had a suspicion, the former Wales boss said: "Yeah, maybe one, now that I think about it."</p>
      <p>When asked if the person played for Wales, Gatland responded: “He may have done, yeah.”</p>
      <p>Gatland clarified the comments were only a suspicion or a doubt, and he had no evidence.</p>
      <p>"And that's the whole time I've been coaching Wales."</p>
      <p>He continued: “It’s probably unfair of me to say I had the suspicions [about one of them] because I’ve got no evidence or anything like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of like just saying, ‘Is there a possibility?'"</p>
      <p>Asked if he felt it was his role to confront the player, he said: "No, no.</p>
      <p>"It was more like a couple of people making jokes sort of thing."</p>
      <p>“Truth in humour?,” Molloy asked.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, exactly,” Gatland responded.</p>

      <p>The coach, who is promoting his autobiography, said: "The sad thing about professional sport, and whether it's team sport or individual sport, when money's involved, there's that potential for it to be exploited with performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
      <p>"I think we all want it to stay as clean as we possibly can...</p>
      <p>"I’d like to think that the sport is clean. From a New Zealand perspective, I think it’s pretty clean.</p>
      <p>“But when you go down levels… we’re seeing positives in Wales as well at junior levels and in other nations as well.</p>
      <p>“There’s always that temptation in players wanting to try and play at a higher level and taking the risks by taking drugs. I definitely don’t condone that."</p>
