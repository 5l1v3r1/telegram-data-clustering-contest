      <h1>Torquay and Plymouth in top five healthiest places to live in UK</h1>
      <h2>New research has found the healthiest and unhealthiest towns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:36:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author">Colleen Smith</a></address>
      <p>New research has revealed the UK’s unhealthiest places based on those towns with the most fast food restaurants per person - and it ranks Torquay and Plymouth in the top five healthiest.</p>
      <p>The healthiest place is Dorchester according to the research, but Torquay ranks third at 115 out of the total 117 places and Plymouth is fifth healthiest at 113.</p>
      <p>If you think there's now a Greggs on ever Devon high street it's nothing compared to Birmingham which has an amazing 87 Greggs.</p>
      <p>East Central London ranks at the top of the table with the most McDonald's, KFCs and Dominos per person.</p>
      <p>Galashiels has the most Greggs, West London has the most Pizza Huts and Enfield has the most Burger Kings per head of population.</p>
      <p>The study is part of a wider campaign to find out how lazy the UK is by bean bag retailer Great Bean Bags.</p>
      <p>It follows news that McDonald’s will have a site in every UK county once it opens a Rutland restaurant.And Greggs has just launched its 2,000th store.</p>

      <p>The survey uses location data from six leading high street fast food chains.</p>
      <p>And nutritional therapist, Claudia le Feuvre, explained the concept of 'secondary gain' to explain why more people are eating fast food: "We know takeaways aren’t healthy, but we perceive advantages that keep us trapped in the same cycle - in this case secondary gain might be the convenience, speed or appeasing someone else by getting a takeaway.</p>
      <p>"We even justify it through all kinds of self-talk like ‘it’s been a hard week’ and ‘I deserve a treat’ which can certainly play on our minds and have us heading into the takeaway without even realising it.</p>

      <p>“Fast foods are often formulated to achieve the ‘bliss point’. This is the optimal blend of salt, sugar and fat which triggers the brain to produce feel-good endorphins and dopamine, a neurotransmitter that will keep us coming back for more.</p>
      <p>"The McDonald’s burger bun is classified as confectionary as it has such high sugar content.</p>
      <p>"If it’s not the bliss point, it could be the ‘mouth feel’ that has you going back for more. Food companies work hard to perfect the perfect crunch of a chip for example.”</p>
      <p>Patrick Tonks, creative director at Great Bean Bags which conducted the research, adds: “It’s crazy to see just how many of these leading high street eateries there are across the country. Following the news from McDonald’s, we wanted to see which places in the UK have the most restaurants per capita.</p>

      <p>“Birmingham is home to quite a lot of the restaurants, which is handy if you’re on the lookout for a Greggs, with 87 of them in total in the city.</p>
      <p>"But whilst this research is a bit of fun, it still shows a massive demand for quick food, especially given McDonald’s and its recent plans. It seems that the market is continuing to grow and that demand is still there - and we are firm believers in exercising some balance in life.”</p>
