      <p>Cape Town - <b>JP Duminy</b>, ruled out of the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament due to injury, will stay on with the Paarl Rocks team for the duration of the tournament in a mentorship role.</p>
      <p>In a further move to strengthen the backroom team, CEO James Fortuin announced that Proteas fielding coach <b>Justin Ontong</b> will join the team as specialist fielding coach.</p>
      <p>Ontong recently returned from India where he was the Proteas' fielding coach during their sub-continent tour completed in October.</p>
      <p>Duminy said on Wednesday he was disappointed in missing out on the MSL 2.0 tournament.</p>
      <p>"This was one tournament I was looking forward to play in this year, particularly after missing out last year due to injury.</p>
      <p>"Playing with one of my best mates as well (Faf du Plessis), we've been talking the last month at how excited we were about playing together again,” he said.</p>
      <p>"It's great to be still involved as a mentor for the team and there are lots of younger guys I feel I can assist. One of my biggest passions is team and business culture. To operate from that mindset and see how I can add value to the team culture and environment as well is a great opportunity,” he said.</p>
      <p>Duminy remains the Proteas leading T20I run-scorer and says the Paarl Rocks had a great start getting an overwhelming win against the Cape Town Blitz.</p>
      <p>"There's great mix of experience and youth in the team and some great talent on show. For me it's a great privilege to be involved and share in the experience of the MSL in the next few weeks," he said.</p>
      <p>The Mzansi Super League (MSL 2.0) is taking place from November 8 to December 16.</p>
