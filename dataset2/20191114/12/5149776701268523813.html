      </figure>
      <p>The January transfer window is fast approaching, and work is sure to already be going on behind the scenes at Nottingham Forest on new player comings and goings.</p>
      <p>Twelve new signings were added in the summer, with that business paying dividends as the Reds currently <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/best-chance-nottingham-forest-tipped-3536353">sit fifth in the Championship table.</a></p>
      <p>Head coach <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> has been very guarded about what will happen when the winter window opens, with his focus at the moment very much on what is happening on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Here is what the Frenchman has already said about his January plans...</p>
      <h3>Lamouchi on strikers</h3>
      <p>Forest have <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfers-january-latest-3534689">already been linked with</a> a number of players, including Newcastle United striker Dwight Gayle.</p>
      <p>When asked if up front is an area which may need strengthening, Lamouchi has said: “January, for me, is so far away. There’s no point talking about players who are not in my squad.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-gayle-3454540">“I want to just focus on my players. I am happy with them.”</a>
      </p>
      <p>Lamouchi had previously admitted he would like to have seen his attacking ranks bolstered further in the summer.</p>
      <p>Although the club did look at free agents available, the Frenchman considered there to be a lack of suitable options.</p>

      <h3>Lamouchi on Tyler Walker</h3>
      <p>On the possibility of whether he could recall Tyler Walker, who has been in good form on loan at Lincoln City, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-boss-sabri-lamouchi-3314692">he said back in September:</a> “We have reflected on this, but unfortunately he can come back just in January, not before.</p>
      <p>“It is good to see him doing well, of course.</p>
      <p>“Tyler in Lincoln is doing well, so that is one example of the benefit of going on loan.”</p>
      <h3>Lamouchi on defenders</h3>
      <p>Defender Alexander Milosevic last month left the club “by mutual consent” after failing to make a single appearance this season.</p>
      <p>The Reds still have centre-backs Michael Dawson, Joe Worrall, Chema, Tobias Figueiredo, Yohan Benalouane and Michael Hefele on their books.</p>
      <p>Asked if Milosevic’s departure could free up space in the squad or funds ahead of January, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-alexander-milosevic-lamouchi-3488368">Lamouchi gave nothing away.</a></p>
      <p>“You are talking about the next window,” he said at the time. “We have 11 or 12 games to play until then, so I just want to focus on Luton (who were the club’s next opponents).”</p>

      <h3>Lamouchi on recruitment duo</h3>
      <p>In October, Forest unveiled Francois Modesto as technical director and Jose Anigo as head of international recruitment, although both are understood to have already been working at the club for some time.</p>
      <p>Speaking about their appointments, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-new-duo-3444044">Lamouchi said they would have an eye on the “future”.</a></p>
      <p>“It is good for the club. They are working for the future,” he said when discussing the duo last month.</p>
      <p>“I know them from before, so it is good to have them with us.</p>
      <p>“They help because the manager cannot do everything alone, so they anticipate some (transfer) windows and the (transfer) market, and to work for the long-term with the club.”</p>
      <p>Both Modesto and Anigo are believed to have played a role in the Reds’ summer recruitment.</p>
      <p>Asked if <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-appointments-modesto-anigo-3432341">the announcement of the pair</a> comes with a view to January, Lamouchi said at the time: “Yes, but this is not my job for now.</p>
      <p>“Before January we have 14 games to play, so I just want to focus on my job on the pitch now.</p>
      <p>“But the club starts to work for the future, of course.”</p>
