      <p>Did Hov's seat at the table make it possible for Kap to make a comeback?</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>When the news first broke that <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/jay-z-s-roc-nation-nfl-to-reportedly-donate-400-000-to-chicago-youth-programs-rqiv57hYDUWuOutqfHufEg/">Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter's Roc Nation entertainment company was partnering with the National Football League</a>, there were a lot of critics that took issue with the business arrangement. Some detractors specifically had a problem with Colin Kaepernick not being involved in the deal.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick has now been given the chance to conduct a "combine-style" workout for interested teams this Saturday in Atlanta. There are reports claiming Jay-Z was somehow involved in getting the alleged blackballed quarterback an opportunity to return to the NFL.</p>
      <p>"I am also told that Jay-Z - who has been working with the NFL on some social justice initiatives - was involved in this and pushed this idea to some extent," reported NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.</p>
      <p>Plus, Rapoport, tweeted, "Two notes: 1. Jay-Z, a partner with the NFL on social justice, had some influence here. 2. This is not part of Kaepernick’s settlement, nor did he ask for this in his settlement."</p>
      <p><i>First Take</i> host Stephen A. Smith also mentioned the Hip Hop mogul when speaking about the upcoming Kaepernick workout. ESPN's highest-paid personality said, "The name that comes to my mind is Jay-Z and Roc Nation."</p>
      <p>For his part, Kaepernick seems eager to display his skills for NFL franchises. He posted a tweet on Tuesday that confirmed that he will be attending the workout this weekend.</p>
      <p>"I’m just getting word from my representatives that the NFL league office reached out to them about a workout in Atlanta on Saturday. I’ve been in shape and ready for this for 3 years, can’t wait to see the head coaches and GMs on Saturday," wrote Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>Jay-Z's partnership with the NFL supports the Inspire Change initiative which focuses on education and economic advancement, police and community relations, and criminal justice reform. Additionally, all proceeds from Inspire Change apparel and the <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/nfl-names-sash-s-what-would-a-champion-do-as-initial-inspire-change-song-of-the-season-v-CiU3F6ZU2iW-lMMxjdiA/">"Songs of the Season"</a> series go toward the League's philanthropic efforts.</p>
