      <h1>Bayelsa/Kogi elections: Court to hear suit challenging Bello’s eligibility on Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:44:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>A suit challenging whether the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, is fit to contest for the November 16 governorship election in the state will tomorrow, Friday, come up at the Federal High Court, Abuja.</p>
      <p>The originating summon, which is instituted by Natasha Akpoti, the Social Democratic Party governorship candidate in the forthcoming poll, will be mentioned at Court 5 before Justice Inyang Ekwo.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that while SDP candidate is the plaintiff, the All Progressives Congress and the Independent National Electoral Commission are 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.</p>
      <p>The suit, dated October 10 and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1221/2019, filed by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, on Akpoti’s behalf, sought the court’s determination on the eligibility of Governor Bello in the Saturday election, having been allegedly involved in double registration as a voter.</p>
      <p>Akpoti said “that by his wilful act of making double registration as a voter, Yahaya Bello, candidate of the 1st defendant is not a fit and proper person to be allowed by the 2nd defendant to vote or be voted for in the forthcoming Kogi state governorship election, having committed an act of electoral fraud.</p>
      <p>“That Mr. Yahaya Bello, the candidate of the 1st Defendant was initially registered as a voter sometime in 2011 in Abuja, by the 2nd defendant.</p>
      <p>“That Bello, the candidate of the 1st defendant again fraudulently procured from the 2nd defendant. a second registration as a voter on 23rd May 2017, at Government House, Lokoja, while his 2011 first registration as a voter in Abuja was still live, extant and subsisting.</p>
      <p>“That the said Yahaya Bello, the candidate of the 1st defendant carried out the double registration with the 2nd defendant so as to scuttle due electoral process.</p>
      <p>“That such a person is not a fit and proper person to be voted for in any election, let alone for the high office of the governor of a state.”</p>
