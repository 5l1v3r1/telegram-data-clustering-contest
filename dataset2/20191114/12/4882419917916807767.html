      <p>Philippe Coutinho costs Bayern Munich over half-a-million euros per match, per a report from German newspaper Bild.</p>
      <p>On loan from Barcelona at Bayernm, the player cost the Bavarians 8.5m euros in terms of a loan fee, while he has a 25m euro a year salary. His total cost to Bayern is 33.5m euros.</p>
      <p>So he will cost the club a minimum of 657,000 euros per match, and that is assuming he will play in every game, includng the DFB Cup and Champions League finals.</p>
      <p>Coutinho was also recently named as the loan player with the most value in the five big leagues, per the CIES Football Observatory.</p>
      <p>Their study reports that he is worth 96.5 million euros - a figure under the 120m euro option to buy that Bayern Munich have on the midfielder.</p>
      <p>He is not having a great time in Germany where he is no longer essential after a promising start tot he season.</p>
      <p>Coutinho is playing where he likes, in attacking midfield, when he does feature.</p>
      <p>He is followed by Arsenal's Dani Ceballos (65.7m euros) and Martin Odegaard of Real Sociedad (57.3m), both on loan from Real Madrid.</p>
