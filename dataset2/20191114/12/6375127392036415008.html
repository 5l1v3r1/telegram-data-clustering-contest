      <h1>Cayetano slams Drilon barb as fake news</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:04:20+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/jester-p-manalastas" target="_blank">Jester P. Manalastas</a></address>
      <h3>FAKE news.</h3>
      <h3>This is how Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano described the claim of Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon that the administration’s ‘’Build Build Build’’ program is a “dismal failure.”</h3>
      <p>In an interview, Cayetano said Senator Drilon is “deceiving” the public when he called the program a failure.</p>
      <p>According to Cayetano, compared to other presidents, it is only during the time of President Rodrigo Duterte when a large number of infrastructure projects have been approved and constructed.</p>
      <p>The House Speaker said the program was implemented not for political reasons but to uplift the lives of the Filipino people.</p>
      <p>“Panlilinlang na naman o fake news ang sabihin na failure ang ‘Build, Build, Build. Pero puwede bang mas marami at bilisan? Siyempre. You can always say that if we make 10 [projects], ang target natin 10, we can go to 15,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Drilon slammed the Build Build Build project saying only nine out of the 75 proposed flagship projects have been started during the Duterte administration.</p>
      <p>“It is sad to say that the BBB program of the administration is a dismal failure. Out of the 75 flagship projects that were proposed at the start of the administration, exactly nine started construction. That is only 2% of the total,” Drilon said.</p>
      <p>But Cayetano said Drilon did not take into account projects that are already in the pipeline and those started from scratch, which are more difficult to construct.</p>
      <p>“For example, yung subway. Napakahirap gawin nun, from scratch ginawa ng administrasyong ito iyon. Pero before the end of the President’s administration, two or three stations will be opened,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cayetano said in order for the House to help, a new House special committee will be formed to be headed by Tarlac Rep. Charlie Cojuangco. The panel’s main purpose is to oversee and ensure the speedy implementation of the remaining flagship projects under the “Build, Build, Build” program.</p>
      <p>Cayetano expressed confidence that before the Duterte administration ends in 2022 all of the infrastructure projects will be finished.</p>
