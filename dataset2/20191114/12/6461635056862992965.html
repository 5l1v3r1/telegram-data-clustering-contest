      <h1>Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique at crossroads over new Barcelona manager’s appointment</h1>

      <h3>Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique have contrasting points of opinion to offer as far as the appointment of a new Barcelona coach is concerned.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde has come under the scanner in recent months and was perhaps lucky to have kept his job coming into 2019/20 following his side’s massive collapse at the business end of last season. The Blaugrana threw away a 3-0 advantage from the first leg in the Champions League and then lost the Copa del Rey Final to Valencia by a 2-1 score.</p>
      <p>La Liga’s defending champions are toppers in the domestic league as well as their group in the Champions League, but already having lost thrice in La Liga has meant that the rallying for Ernesto Valverde being fired has begun and is stronger than ever. Apparently, the club has given him time until mid-December to salvage his job.</p>
      <p>River Plate manager Marcelo Gallardo is among those who are in contention to land the potentially vacant job from the Camp Nou. The Argentinian manager has had a great amount of success in South America and <a href="https://www.diariogol.com/fcbarcelona/pillado-y-es-messi-asunto-muy-feo-pique-calla-por-vergueenza-lio-brutal-en-el-barca_20009750_102.html"><b>Diario GOL has reported</b></a> that Barca’s most important dressing room figure- Lionel Messi- is in favour of the appointment.</p>
      <p>Gerard Pique however believes that Gallardo’s appointment could be fatal for the Catalans. The central defender has a point in his mind which conveys that the River Plate boss does not have much experience to lead a Barca side seeking results at the earliest and thinks that Marcelo Gallardo’s appointment would create another Tata Martino situation at the club.</p>
      <p>Netherlands’ manager Ronald Koeman is also one of the members of the club’s managerial candidates’ shortlist as is former manager Pep Guardiola according to some fresh claims. However, it is unthinkable of either coming to the Camp Nou in the winter and Barcelona would have to wait for the bigger names until the off-season.</p>
      <p>Who do you think would be the best replacement for Ernesto Valverde at the club?</p>
