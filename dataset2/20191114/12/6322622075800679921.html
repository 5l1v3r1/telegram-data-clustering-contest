      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): Amalgamated Industrial Steel Bhd (AISB) is acquiring five parcels of land near the under-construction Damansara Damai MRT station in Sungai Buloh for RM31 million.</p>
      <p>The leasehold commercial land parcels, measuring 14,365 sq metres in total, house a single-storey sports centre and a one-and-a-half-storey reconditioned car showroom, AISB said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The group said the property is located within an area with mixed commercial and residential development and it is 15km from Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>It is strategically located within four km from the Sungai Buloh MRT station and is easily accessible to the North-South Expressway, Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP) and Duta-Ulu Kelang Expressway, said AISB.</p>
      <p>The group said its wholly-owned subsidiary, Parkwood Damai Sdn Bhd, signed the sale and purchase agreement with Rias Niaga Sdn Bhd today.</p>
      <p>The proposed acquisition, it said, will be funded via a combination of internally-generated funds and bank borrowings.</p>
      <p>Loss-making AISB is involved in the sale of steel-related products and property development.</p>
      <p>It said the proposed acquisition is in line with the group’s long-term strategy to grow its property development business by tapping into strategic locations with development potential where the infrastructure, amenities and connectivity are established.</p>
      <p>Upon completion of the acquisition, the group said it intends to plan and carry out a redevelopment to realise the land’s earning potential.</p>
      <p>AISB’s share price closed half a sen or 2.13% higher at 24 sen today, bringing the group a market capitalisation of RM33.02 million.</p>
