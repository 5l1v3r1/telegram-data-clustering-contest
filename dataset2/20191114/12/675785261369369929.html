      <h1>Liverpool hero claims Harry Kane would get into Jurgen Klopp's side ahead of Anfield star</h1>
      <h2>After biding his time and eventually breaking into the Tottenham first-team, Kane, 26, has become one of the deadliest strikers in European football</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:40:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy says Harry Kane would walk into Liverpool's team ahead of Roberto Firmino - but reckons a world-record fee would prevent the move from happening.</p>
      <p>After biding his time and eventually breaking into the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> first-team, Kane, 26, has become one of the deadliest strikers in European football.</p>
      <p>The England star has scored 174 goals in just 267 appearances for Spurs and is already into double figures for the current campaign despite their struggles under Mauricio Pochettino this season.</p>
      <p>And, although Murphy doesn't think the Reds have the funds to prise Kane away from north London, he is of the opinion that the Spurs star is more prolific than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> forward Firmino.</p>

      <p>“Liverpool or City, would he get in both teams?” Murphy said on <a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1194668750147969024"><i>talkSPORT</i> </a>. “Would Liverpool and City fans take Harry Kane now?</p>
      <p>“I think Harry Kane would get in Liverpool’s team ahead of Firmino, because I think he’d score more goals. I love Firmino but he’s not Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>“And I think with Aguero being nearly 32, I think City fans would welcome Harry Kane with open arms.</p>
      <p>“That’s not to say he’s better than Aguero, City fans aren’t going to have that argument, it’s not about that.</p>
      <p>“But right now if Harry Kane was on the shopping list, would City fans be happy?</p>

      <p>“What would he cost? That’s another question. Because you’ve got FFP as well. It could be a world record.”</p>
      <p>While Kane has enjoyed a bright start to the season on a personal level, the club are in somewhat of a crisis and Pochettino faces an uncertain future as boss.</p>
      <p>Just over five months ago, Pochettino was on the brink of Champions League glory following Spurs' remarkable run to the final, the culmination of a season in which he was also heavily linked with the jobs at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , such was his stock.</p>
      <p>Beaten by Liverpool in that final, and following a wretched start to this season, Pochettino has now suggested he may not be given time to continue what he considers to be a rebuilding process at the club.</p>
      <p>The facts do not lie, as Spurs have won just three league games this season and only six of their last 24.</p>
