        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 14 – Forty-four Nairobi MCAs allied to the National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition Thursday signed a petition to kick out their Minority Leader Elias Otieno.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The motion to have Otieno removed was fronted by Kabiro MCA Clarence Otieno and handed over to the party’s Minority Whip Peter Imwatok.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The petition was signed by members in a parliamentary meeting attended by all MCAs of NASA affiliate parties predominately made up of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) in the presence of the ousted Minority Leader.</p>
      <p>The Minority Whip said the meeting was guided by the Nairobi County Assembly Standing Order 21 and Section 10(3) of the County Governments Act, 2017.</p>
      <p>“A member designated under paragraph (1) maybe removed by the party or coalition of parties that designated him or her by two-thirds of votes all members of the second largest party or coalition of parties in the County Assembly,” Imwatok quoted.</p>
      <p>He the party has 48 hours to replace Otieno, under the Assembly’s Standing Order 21 (1) which gives the party the sole mandate to do so.</p>
      <p>Otieno who represent the Kileleshwa ward in Nairobi County Assembly has been accused of defying the ODM party position on several occasions including on the reinstatement of Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi.</p>
      <p>He was also accused of undermining the ODM candidate in the Kibra by-election, Imran Okoth, after he publicly announced his support for Amani National Congress (ANC) candidate Eliud Owalo.</p>
      <p>The MCAs also cited is incompetence claiming that he failed to provide the Minority Party/Coalition with direction when required.</p>
      <p>He was accused of opposing the nomination of Nairobi West MCA Maurice Gari to the Assembly’s Public Service Board.</p>
      <p>MCAs faulted Otieno for going to court to sue ODM over his nomination, instead of using dispute resolution mechanisms under the party’s constitution.</p>
      <p>Otieno was also accused of disrespecting the women leadership.</p>
      <p>The ouster came just days after Jubilee Party made temporary changes on the Assembly leadership following wrangles pitting Guyo against Speaker Beatrice Elachi.</p>
      <p>According to the changes, Dandora 3 MCA Charles Thuo will be the Majority Leader and will be deputized by Ziwani Kariokor MCA Millicent Mugadi.</p>
      <p>Nominated MCA June Ndegwa was designated Majority Whip deputized by Hassan Abdikadir.</p>
