      <p>Students of Ayrshire College have backed the Kilmarnock Standard’s campaign to boost voter registration in next month’s general election.</p>
      <p>This week we spoke with social science students of Ayrshire College who told us why they believe youth engagement is important and spoke about how young people are often silenced from participating in the discussion.</p>
      <p>The students worry voter turn out could be suppressed by the date being so close to Christmas.</p>
      <p>“It all comes down to how engaged people really are in politics,” said Ella Tannock, aged 19. “If you are then you will use your vote.”</p>
      <p>When asked whether the vote should have been extended to 16 to 17 year-olds, as it is in Scottish elections, the students said “definitely”.</p>
      <p>22-year-old Mark Rorison said: “The first time I voted was when I turned 16 and we had the Scottish Referendum.</p>
      <p>“I really engaged with it and I think that is because I was allowed a say.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But I did not vote in the EU referendum,” he added. “I didn’t really know much about it and I didn’t see how my vote would have an effect.</p>
      <p>“When I saw what happened I thought differently. But I would have voted remain and that’s how Scotland voted.”</p>
      <p>One student who will not turn 18 until January next year told us it was frustrating to be denied a vote at such an important turning point for the country.</p>
      <p>She said: “If we were given the vote on Scottish Independence that should have been it, we should have got it for everything. I will of course be using my vote when I become 18.”</p>
      <p>However, they say not all young people are motivated to engage in politics.</p>
      <p>“I know someone who did not know what Brexit was when I was at school,” said 18-year-old Rebecca Hainey.</p>
      <p>The students say mixed messages about youth engagement make it difficult for young people to have the confidence to get involved.</p>
      <p>“I think young people are actually discouraged from participating.</p>
      <p>“When we do voice our opinion we are told we’re too young but if we don’t say something then we’re lazy,” said Ella.</p>
      <p>“The way adults talk about Greta Gerwig is so unfair. She is a young person just trying to stick up for what she believes in and people are making fun of her and dressing up as her for Halloween.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I want to know more, I’m 19 I can vote but we were not taught a lot about voting in school.”</p>
      <p>The majority of students said they get their information and news from social media, particularly Facebook.</p>
      <p>Every student we spoke with said they would be using their vote on December 12 - however they also acknowledged limitations to the First Past the Post voting system which they said “benefits some and not others”.</p>
      <p>However, “not voting is a waste,” said 23-year-old Emma Jamie. “Some people do not have a chance to vote so it’s wrong if you don’t use yours.”</p>
      <p>Charlotte Mitchell, head of Ayrshire College Students Association said: “It is important that students vote on matters which affect them and what a bigger matter to have a say in than who runs the country, particularly at a time when there is so much at stake.</p>
      <p>“As a democratically run organisation Ayrshire College Students Association is keen to encourage as many students as possible to engage in the democratic process and use their vote.</p>
      <p>“Opportunities for students to register to vote will be happening across the college over the next few weeks with pop-up registration roadshows on each campus.”</p>
