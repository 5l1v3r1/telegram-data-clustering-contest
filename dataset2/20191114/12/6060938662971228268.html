      <p>A picture of India’s first Prime Minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> in which a woman can be seen kissing him is being shared to malign him and portray him as a womanizer.</p>
      <p>The picture is being shared with the claim that Nehru couldn’t come out of the clutches of Britishers, thereby implying that he exchanged a kiss with a British woman.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user shared the image with a caption in Hindi that loosely translates to, “Nehru was at the peak of freedom struggle, but the Britishers kept him captive via crooked means. Even after trying hard, Nehru couldn’t resist freeing himself. Here’s a photo that symbolizes his struggle.”</p>

          <u>TRUTH</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The lady seen kissing Nehru in the picture is his niece Nayantara Sehgal and not a British woman. The picture was taken when Nehru arrived at London Airport in 1955.</p>
      <p><b><u>VERIFICATION AND METHODOLOGY<br/></u></b>Using reverse-image search on Google and relevant keywords, we found an <a href="https://thehumornation.com/truth-behind-nehru-kissing-lady/">article</a> on a website called Humor Nation, which mentions the lady kissing Nehru as his niece Nayantara Sehgal, when he visited London in 1955.</p>
      <p>Taking a cue from that using keywords ‘Nehru London 1955 visit’, we found a video uploaded by verified account of British Pathé on April 13, 2014.</p>
      <p>Titled ‘Mr Nehru Arrives At London Airport (1955)’, the description of the video mentions that Nehru was accompanied by his daughter <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/indira-gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> on that trip. He met his sister Mrs <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vijaya-Lakshmi-Pandit">Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit</a> at the airport.</p>

      <p>At 0:27 one can see the same visual of a lady greeting and kissing Nehru, but from a slightly different angle.</p>
      <p>Seeing her from different angles, it is confirmed that she is indeed Nayantara Sehgal, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit’s daughter, Nehru’s niece. Before giving a peck on Nehru’s cheek, she could also be seen hugging Indira.</p>
      <p>The original image is also <a href="https://www.alamy.com/jul-07-1955-a-kiss-for-mr-nehru-the-indian-prime-minister-mr-nehru-image69293917.html">available</a> on Alamy stock photo agency.</p>
