      <p>Realme is on a roll when it comes to providing updates for its smartphones. The company seems to be especially committed this week. It already updated several devices such as Realme 3, 3i, Realme 5 and Realme 2 Pro. Except for Realme 5, all the said devices have received the November security patch. Now, the company is giving the same treatment to the 64MP mid-range beast – Realme XT.</p>
      <p>The latest OTA update, carries RMX1921EX_11.A.12 serial number, for the Realme XT brings the Android security patch for November 2019.

      <p>One of the main selling points of Realme XT is the powerful camera capabilities thanks to the Quad-Rear camera system led by a 64MP shooter. There are other interesting specs like the Snapdragon 730G and the AMOLED display, but the camera undoubtedly is a key element in this phone. Apart from the Nightscape for Selfies, the update also improves the Wide-Angle Video recording. Moreover, it comes to address an issue that was making the camera crash in the 64MP photography mode.
