      <p>Benjamin Auguste, project director for Groupe Legendre, appeared in the Magistrate's Court on Thursday following the incidents earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Police legal adviser Simon Crowder, prosecuting, said that it was difficult to measure the harm that the incidents had caused but that it was likely there were already a large number of pollutants in the marina due to the nature of the activities which took place there.</p>
      <p>He added that environmental protection officers had carried out extensive sampling and testing of the affected area of the marina and there was no evidence of aquatic life being harmed. The pollution was predominantly 'visual' and the risk had been 'low', he said.</p>
      <p>Advocate James Angus, defending Groupe Legendre, said that the unexpected discovery of an old, unrecorded and irregularly-shaped sea wall during the excavation had stopped the business from putting in measures which would have stopped silt from escaping.</p>
      <p>However, he said that after finding it, work stopped immediately and a geo-texture membrane was ordered and installed shortly after.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Bridget Shaw fined the company £10,000.</p>
      <p>'This is a major public construction project and the public should have confidence in a company that it puts its environmental responsibilities at the fore of everything that it does and you say it does,' she said.</p>
      <p>'But on this occasion, your company fell short.'</p>
