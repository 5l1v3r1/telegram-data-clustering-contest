      <p>Cast your minds back to 2009 when a shy teenager stepped onto The X Factor stage and wowed both the show's judges and viewers at home with his rendition of Luther Vandross' Dance With My Father.</p>
      <p>That boy was of course <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joe-mcelderry">Joe McElderry</a> and under the guidance of the region's own Cheryl Cole, the South Shields singer went onto win the ITV show that year.</p>
      <p>He was crowned the winner when huge audiences tuned in week after week and millions of votes were cast in the final.</p>
      <p>Ten years have now passed since then 18-year-old Joe beat Olly Murs in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">The X Factor</a> final, and went onto land a huge number 1 with debut single The Climb, albeit slightly delayed after THAT Rage Against the Machine Christmas no.1 campaign.</p>
      <p>Since then Joe has been kept busy by releasing a string of top 10 albums, the last being 2017's Saturday Night at the Movies; winning other TV talent shows - being champion of both Popstar to Operastar and The Jump - and treading the boards in hit musicals Joseph &amp; the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat and Club Tropicana.</p>

      <p>But now, the 28-year-old is back to focusing on music with his Impossible Dream tour, which has already entertained Whitley Bay and saw Joe host a special 'Audience with...' style event at The Customs House in his native South Shields at the start of the month.</p>
      <p>The next Impossible Dream show brings Joe to a familiar stomping ground of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-theatre">Tyne Theatre</a> in Newcastle on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>He told ChronicleLive: "I’m so excited to be celebrating 10 years with the tour! We have already done two shows and the response has been amazing.</p>
      <p>"For people to hear right the way through my music over the last 10 years to right now and celebrating all of the projects that have been milestones in my career so far has been wonderful to look back on.</p>
      <p>"The show is filled with lots of old and new material some that people may have heard and brand new material that I have been working on for my new album. <br/><br/>"It’s a true celebration with the people who have supported me over the years."</p>
      <p>
