      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- New York is the first state to release the names of medical facilities that have treated patients with a deadly, drug-resistant fungus that is spreading.</p>
      <p>64 hospitals, 103 long-term care nursing homes, a long-term care hospital and three hospice units in New York have cared for patients with an especially virulent germ called Candida auris. Most of the patients were in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
      <p>New York health officials disclosed the names of the facilities because Candida auris has been spreading quickly.</p>
      <p>Michael Craig, an antibiotic resistance expert for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the newspaper that someone in the United States dies of a resistant infection every 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Back in May, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/health/ny-officials-wont-disclose-facilities-hit-by-deadly-superbug/5287285/">7 On Your Side Investigates reported </a>that health officials were refusing to identify the hospitals and nursing homes affected by the fungus.</p>
      <p>"It's a very serious health threat," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, Columbia University professor and an expert on public health policy. "It's a superbug, meaning resistant to all-known antibiotics."<br/>Hospitals, the Center for Disease Control, and New York City and state health departments had refused to give 7 On Your Side Investigates the names of the facilities where Candida auris has caused serious illness and deaths.</p>
