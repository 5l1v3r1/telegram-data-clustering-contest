        <b>The government has banned the heartburn drug Ranitidine made with raw materials from two Indian companies after detecting high levels of cancer-causing ingredients in them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Directorate General of Drug Administration announced the move on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The two Indian companies that supply the raw material – Ranitidine hydrochloride – are Saraca Laboratories Limited and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, according to the DGDA.</p>
      <p>Tests run on the raw materials from these companies and the finished product revealed higher than normal levels of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which the US Food and Drug Administration says is a “probable human carcinogen, the authority said.</p>
      <p>The drug authority has accordingly banned the production, sale and marketing of Ranitidine products made using the materials supplied by the Indian firms.</p>
      <p>But the ban is unlikely to have any impact on the treatment of patients, according to physicians.</p>
      <p>“It’s not an essential drug now. We have so many alternatives and better drugs available in the market,” Dr Raj Datta, a consultant of the Sheikh Russel Gastroliver Institute and Hospital, told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>He pointed to drugs like omeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole as viable alternatives. “But the cost of Ranitidine is slightly lower than others.”</p>
