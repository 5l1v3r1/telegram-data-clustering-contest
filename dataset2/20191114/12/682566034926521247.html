      <p>United States -<b> James Harden</b> was labeled "amazing" by coach <b>Mike D'Antoni </b>after erupting in a fourth-quarter scoring spree to lead the Houston Rockets to a <b>102-93</b> victory over the <b>Los Angeles Clippers</b> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Harden led the scoring with 47 points, including seven three-pointers, while the former NBA MVP also added six rebounds and seven assists.</p>
      <p>The Houston talisman plundered 17 points late in the fourth quarter to help transform an 84-80 deficit with 5min 52sec remaining into victory.</p>
      <p>"It's not like we haven't seen it before, and we'll see it again," Rockets head coach D'Antoni said. </p>
      <p>"He's amazing. He's just a master of the game. It's what I expect. He's a special player, no doubt about it."</p>
      <p>Harden shouldered the bulk of the Rockets' offensive duties, with Russell Westbrook (17) and Clint Capela (12) the only other Houston players to score double figures.</p>
      <p>The Clippers were led by Kawhi Leonard, who had 26 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists.</p>
      <p>Lou Williams had 20 off the bench for the Clippers while JaMychal Green added 14 as the Clippers fell to 7-4 with the defeat.</p>
      <p>The Clippers also had coach Doc Rivers ejected in a surreal exchange late in the fourth quarter which saw his son -- Rockets shooting guard Austin Rivers -- urging officials to toss him.</p>
      <p>"It was a really good moment," Austin Rivers joked afterwards. </p>
      <p>"I enjoyed it a lot. I'm not gonna lie to you. I really did enjoy that."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lakers rout Warriors</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rockets improved to 8-3, leaving them hard on the heels of the Los Angeles Lakers, who cruised to a blowout 120-94 win over the injury-decimated Golden State Warriors on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Warriors, who reached five consecutive NBA Finals from 2015-2019 have endured a nightmare start to the season, with a long-term injury to Stephen Curry depleting a squad already attempting to adjust from the loss of Klay Thompson (knee) and departure of Kevin Durant to the Brooklyn Nets.</p>
      <p>The Lakers were in no mood to show the Warriors any mercy at the Staples Center on Wednesday, LeBron James scoring 23 points and Kyle Kuzma 22 in a comfortable win. </p>
      <p>The Lakers, who have not have reached the playoffs since 2013, lead the Western Conference with a 9-2 record.</p>
      <p>In the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics improved to 9-1 to remain on top of the table after a 140-133 defeat of the Washington Wizards.</p>
      <p>Kemba Walker had 25 points in an impressive all-round scoring display by the Celtics, who saw seven players reach double digits.</p>
      <p>Walker was backed by Jayson Tatum with 23 points and Jaylen Brown with 22. Turkish star Enes Kanter meanwhile pulled down nine rebounds as well as contributing 13 points.</p>
      <p>But it was a frustrating night for Washington's Bradley Beal, who finished with 44 points, five rebounds and six assists yet somehow ended on the losing side.</p>
      <p>In Orlando, Nikola Vucevic scored 25 points as the Magic jolted the Philadelphia 76ers with a 112-97 victory.</p>
      <p>The Sixers, playing without the injured Joel Embiid, fell to 7-4 after the loss while Joel Embiid Orlando improved to 4-7.</p>
      <p>In Portland, the reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors eased past the Trail Blazers after another superb display from Pascal Siakam.</p>
      <p>Siakam, who had scored 24 points in a win over the Lakers on Sunday, once again led the scoring with 36 points, receiving backing from Fred VanVleet who finished with 30. </p>
