      <p>Just because there's no budget left, doesn't mean you need to give up on the work Christmas party, as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgroceries.morrisons.com%2Fwebshop%2FstartWebshop.do&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fyou-can-now-your-work-20879973">Morrisons</a> has decided to step in and save the day by offering out its beloved cafés for festive events - and you'll still get a three course traditional turkey dinner, complete with all the trimmings.</p>
      <p>Okay so it might not be the most picturesque setting out there, but it's an absolute steal at £7.50 per head, and there's still plenty of spaces left if you've still not gotten around to booking anywhere.</p>
      <p>Christmas party goers can pick from an extensive menu including prawn cocktail starters, roast dinners that contain both roast AND mashed potato as well as Christmas pudding with custard for dessert. There's also an array of vegan and vegetarian alternatives, including Mushroom Wellington for main.</p>
      <p>Prices start at £6.50 for two courses, or three for £7.50 each, with the store able to cater for tables of up to 20 people. We've got the full menu below.</p>

      <p>Morrisons says that it's decided to open up its cafés for Christmas parties after finding out that many businesses are deciding to cut back on the work parties this Christmas due to tough trading conditions, economic uncertainty and fragile confidence.</p>
      <p>The supermarket is already taking bookings for dates between Monday 25th November to Monday 23rd December,also making it ideal for panicked planners who are still yet to book a venue for the occasion.</p>
      <p>Helen Tordoff, Head of Cafes at Morrisons commented: “Some small businesses have had a tough year so we have created the best Christmas meal for those on a budget.</p>
      <p>And as our cafés regularly host group meet ups, we thought we’d extend the invite to local companies so they can save some Christmas costs. It will mean that more people can get into the party spirit without breaking the bank.”</p>
