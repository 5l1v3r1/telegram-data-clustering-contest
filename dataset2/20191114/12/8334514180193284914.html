      <p>The state-run NHS has provided free at the point of use healthcare for more than 70 years and is a highly emotive issue before the Dec. 12 election, with voters rating it as the second most important subject after Brexit.</p>
      <p>NHS England said on Thursday the percentage of patients seen within four hours in all accident and emergency departments stood at 83.6% in October, down from the 85.2% the month before and 89.1% a year ago.</p>
      <p>This was the worst performance since records began in 2004. The overall target of 95% was last met in July 2015.</p>
      <p>The news sparked an immediate war of words.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Matt Hancock said the figures showed Britain could not afford to have a Labour government run by Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>“We are giving the biggest cash boost ever to our NHS, but Corbyn’s chaotic policies will put that at risk,” he said in a statement. The Conservatives have been in power since 2010.</p>
      <p>Labour’s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, said the Conservatives had “ushered in the worst NHS crisis on record”.</p>
      <p>The four-hour target was first introduced by Labour’s Tony Blair in 2004 in a bid to stop patients being left to languish on trolleys in corridors.</p>
      <p>Johnson has toured a string of hospitals since he took office in July, arguing that he will be able to invest more in the health service once he has resolved Brexit.</p>
      <p>But the deteriorating performance shows the perils of holding a winter election. Polls show the left-leaning Labour Party is favored by voters to oversee the health service.</p>
      <p>Providing care from the cradle to the grave, the NHS is struggling with record demand from a growing and ageing population, as well as cutbacks to social care services.</p>
      <p>Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper noted that 97% of patients were treated within four hours when the Conservatives came into office in 2010.</p>
      <p>John Appleby, head of independent think-tank the Nuffield Trust, said the figures showed the next government would face one of the bleakest winters in the NHS’s history.</p>
      <p>“As the election promises roll in, we should be under no illusion about the money, staff and time it will take to turn this situation around,” he said.</p>
