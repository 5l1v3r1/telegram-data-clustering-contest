      <h2>Arsenal legend Ray Parlour believes Unai Emery needs to follow the example of Arsene Wenger to find a clear direction for his side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:33:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Ray Parlour says Unai Emery must learn lessons from predecessor Arsene Wenger by transferring a clear plan to his players.</p>
      <p>Emery has come under fire after a poor start to the season which has left the Gunners eight points off the top four and the Spaniard under pressure.</p>
      <p>Former captain Parlour has questioned the lack of direction under Emery, stating he is still unsure of his best formation and system.</p>
      <p>After making little progress over the last 18 months, Parlour believes Emery needs to focus on finding the right formula rather than chopping and changing.</p>
      <p>He has called on him to follow Wenger's example of ensuring each player knows their job to deliver better results on matchdays.</p>

      <p>Parlour told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/629302/arsenal-unai-emery-ray-parlour/">talkSPORT</a> : “Emery doesn’t know his best team and he doesn’t know his best formation, but he should know! You’ve got to work on these formations. Do they work on them?</p>
      <p>“[Mesut] Ozil was frozen out and now he’s back in favour, and defensively they’re still not solid enough.</p>

      <p>“All these things are not in the right direction for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> at the moment.</p>
      <p>“I don’t mind three at the back, but you’ve got to work on it week in, week out in training, so the players know exactly what their jobs are as a team and then we can maybe move up the league.</p>
      <p>“He needs to say the formation we’re going to play and stick to it!</p>

      <p>“You can’t keep changing systems. At the moment it’s 4-2-3-1, then it’s 4-3-3 and then it’s three at the back, nobody really knows!</p>
      <p>“It’s about finding the right formula and then working with the players so they understand how he wants them to play, and then it’s down to them when they cross the white line.</p>
      <p>“That’s why Arsene Wenger did so well. He trained you, everyone knew their jobs and then he’d leave you alone and say, ‘on match day it’s down to you’.”</p>
