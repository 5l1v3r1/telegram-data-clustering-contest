      <p>DoT has sent letters to internet services providers (ISPs) to submit the audited <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adjusted-gross-revenue">Adjusted Gross Revenue </a>(AGR) documents up to 2018-19 in Kerala circle and will soon start sending them across the country for compliance of the Supreme court order on AGR dues payment.</p>
      <p>In letters to the Kerala circle ISPs, the DoT said "The Supreme Court while upholding the AGR definition as defined in the licence agreement of DoT has given a time period of three months within which the judgement is to be implemented and compliance reported."</p>
      <p>In view of this, DoT (HQ) has instructed the offices to complete all assessments and reassessment of licencees of Kerala circle and the compliance be reported on documents by November 28.</p>
      <p>Officials said PGCIL, Gail, RailTel, Oil India, and DMRC are likely to be sent letters for paying the AGR that can run into crores.</p>
      <p>The top court has said AGR must include all revenues including those from non-core activities as well if a company has a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/telecom">telecom </a>licence.</p>
