      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T12:55:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/walmart">Walmart </a>Inc reported better-than-expected third quarter US comparable sales on Thursday as people spent more at its stores and website and the retailer picked up market share in food and other groceries.</p>
      <p>The world's largest retailer also raised its annual earnings outlook, sending its shares up over 3 per cent in premarket trade.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/walmart">Walmart </a>has now posted a 21-quarter, or over five-year, streak of US growth, unmatched by any other retail chain.</p>
      <p>Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.2%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended Oct.31. Analysts estimated growth of 2.9%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.16 per share, beating expectations of $1.09 per share.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/online-sales">Online sales </a>rose 41%, higher than the previous quarter's increase of 37 pct and greater than the company's expectation of 35%.</p>
      <p>Operating income continued to remain under pressure and fell 5.4 percent to $4.7 billion as a result of ongoing investments in its e-commerce business.</p>
      <p>Walmart's online expansion has come at a cost to profitability, and losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about $1.7 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/walmart">Walmart </a>forecast earnings per share, including the impact from its acquisition of Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart, to increase "slightly" from a year ago.</p>
      <p>Total revenue rose 2.5 percent to $128 billion.</p>
