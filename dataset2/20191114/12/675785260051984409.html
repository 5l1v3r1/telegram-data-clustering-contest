      <h1>Blind man furious as passengers on packed train 'ignore his request for seat'</h1>
      <h2>Jonathan Attenborough says he and his guide dog were left in the doorway of a ScotRail train and has blasted staff for failing to intervene during his trip between Edinburgh and Perth, Scotland</h2>

      <p>A blind man claims that passengers on a packet train refused to give up their seat for him and his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/guide-dogs">guide dog</a> .</p>
      <p>Jonathan Attenborough says he repeatedly asked people if there were any available seats and did not even get the courtesy of a response.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old said he is "losing faith in humanity" after being forced to stand next to a door for half an hour.</p>
      <p>He has shared photographs of the incident which show how busy the train was on his nightmare trip between Edinburgh's Haymarket and Perth on Monday.</p>
      <p>The student from Newburgh, Fife, also blasted ScotRail staff for not intervening to help him.</p>

      <p>Jonathan said it was essential for blind and visually-impaired people to be seated to help prevent disorientation. He was also concerned that his guide dog, Sam, was in danger of getting his paws or tail crushed.</p>
      <p>He targeted ScotRail, copying in Scottish transport secretary Michael Matheson, in a furious <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> message.</p>
      <p>Jonathan wrote: "Completely unacceptable passenger assistance from @ScotRail to leave me and my guide dog in the doorway of the train.</p>
      <p>"I asked several times if there was any spare seats, and not one passenger responded. Doesn’t give me much faith in humanity @MathesonMichael."</p>

      <p>Jonathan posted two photos of his experience on the train.</p>
      <p>One image shows Sam sitting on the floor surrounded by at least four people standing in the doorway.</p>
      <p>Another photo shows Sam wedged between two bags as he struggles for space. A handbag is also seen hovering over his head.</p>
      <p>The post has angered many people.</p>

      <p>@Notsobigbryan said: "Shame on every single passenger in that carriage."</p>
      <p>@MSenIt4life added: "I think @ScotRail should take responsibility for this! At the very least give you back your money for the ticket! It’s their train; they either don’t have rules in place or haven’t trained their staff. Either way, they should take responsibility for this; there’s no excuse!"</p>
      <p>@Dancesinclogs wrote: "I'm so sorry that you had such bad treatment from @ScotRail and the passengers who ignored you should be ashamed of themselves. Do hope you have recovered from the journey and the experience."</p>
      <p>@Mummasuze said: "I just don’t understand what is wrong with people today, I hope they all feel thoroughly ashamed of themselves."</p>

      <p>@Johnnib_john wrote: "That's absolutely disgraceful, passengers also play a part and should have consideration, shame on them."</p>
      <p>Jonathan said: "It’s important for any blind or visually impaired people to be seated when on moving transport as the movement of the train can be very disorienting, I also like to be seated so that my dog is safely out of the way so that his tail or paws don’t accidentally get stood on by other passengers.</p>
      <p>"It’s difficult to hold on, to keep my balance when having to stand on a moving train, and also hold onto my dog at the same time to ensure that he is okay in situations like this too."</p>

      <p>Referring to the lack of response from fellow passengers, he added: “It made me feel very anxious as I would have expected at least a response even if it was just someone saying that there weren't any seats available.</p>
      <p>"I did not come across any ScotRail staff on the train as it was so crowded that the train conductor couldn’t make his way through the train until it was clearer. I think the customer service experience has to improve from ScotRail especially for disabled people.</p>
      <p>“I also think that some kind of government regulation around assisted travel for disabled people should certainly be looked at as well."</p>

      <p>A ScotRail spokesman told Mirror Online: "It’s really disappointing to learn that no customer offered up a seat for Mr Attenborough.</p>
      <p>"We would expect customers to keep our priority seats, which are located near the doors in our trains, free for people who are less able to stand.</p>
      <p>"We also provide a free assisted travel service to customers who need a little extra help.
