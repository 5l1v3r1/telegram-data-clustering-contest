      <p>Walmart somehow kept the most anticipated Black Friday ad under wraps for as long as possible, but it's finally here.  <br/><br/><b>Also:</b> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/black-friday-2019-best-deals-available-now-update-sales/">Check out CNET for even more Black Friday deals</a> <br/><br/>Though the retailing Goliath is best known for its low prices on a wide variety of everyday products, it always highlights its electronics deals for Black Friday, including a number of deals on PCs (particularly from HP) that won't cost you an arm and a leg. Here are a few of the best Walmart Black Friday deals on laptops, desktops, and even tablets.</p>
      <h3>When is Walmart's Black Friday 2019 sale?</h3>

      </ul>
      <p>Walmart has held a couple different Black Friday sales already this year. An early one kicked off 8 November and lasted until 10 November. It was a three-day online sales event. But Walmart also has an even bigger "Early Access" sale that began in October and is still live for shoppers. It covers even more products than the three-day event did.  <br/><br/><a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2019/11/14/walmart-black-friday-deals-revealed-more-ways-to-save-starting-today">Walmart's Black Friday ad has now also appeared online</a>, revealing that its official Black Friday event starts online at 10pm EST on Wednesday, Nov. 27. In Walmart stores, the event begins at 6pm local time on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, Nov. 28.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This deal is what Walmart does best: A low price on a basic product. This HP Windows laptop has minimal specs (Intel Celeron N4000 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB solid-state drive, 14-inch display), but it costs as little as a Chromebook, and a free year of Microsoft Office 365 Personal is thrown in for good measure.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clearly sick of Amazon's runaway success with the Kindle Fire HD tablets at their rock-bottom prices, Walmart responded with a line of equally cheap Android tablets under its Onn. house brand. (Yes, it's "Onn." with a period.) For this year's Black Friday, Walmart has taken notice of the number of stores selling the Kindle Fire HD 7 for $29.99 and decided to one-up them ever so slightly. It's slashed the price of its 7-inch Onn. Android tablet to $28 to ensure that it has a lower price -- and tosses in a $10 Walmart eBooks credit to sweeten the deal.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>AMD's Ryzen 5 processor has been highly regarded as an alternative to Intel's Core chips, and this 15.6-inch laptop (with its subtly stylish blue chassis) is built around one. Its other midrange specs (for a sub-$400 price tag) include 8 gigs of RAM, both a 1TB hard drive and a 128GB SSD, and Full HD resolution from the display.</p>

      <p>It seems like every retailer that sells computers these days has a least a couple of gaming PCs among its offerings. Then again, there are plenty of gamers on a budget, many of whom might be interested in Walmart's sale on this basic gaming system. It's a little light on storage with just a 256GB SSD but is otherwise capable with a Core i5-9400F CPU, 8GB of RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card.  </p>

      <p>No bargain basement Chromebook, this HP model delivers several upgraded specs for a still affordable price. From its Intel Core i3 processor to its 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD to its 15.6-inch full HD touchscreen, this system has the appearance of a midrange Windows laptop in Chromebook clothing.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Despite the decline in the tablet market, and Amazon's dominance of Android tablets with its cheap Kindle Fire models, Samsung continues to plus away with its Galaxy Tab lineup. If you're looking for a little more refinement than what a Kindle Fire brings (or just a more ad-free experience), Walmart is taking $50 off the 10.1-inch version of the Galaxy Tab A, which features a full HD display and 32GB of built-in storage.</p>

      <h3>Best early Black Friday deals at Walmart</h3>
      <p>Walmart recently announced an "Early Access" sale so customers could get a jumpstart on their online shopping. Pitched as a pre-Black Friday sale, Early Access includes rollbacks across many categories, including tech and electronics. But the best part is all the deals, which originally went live Oct. 25, are still available in the run-up to Black Friday.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Apple AirPods dominate the Bluetooth earbud space, but they're rarely ever hugely discounted. So, while this may not seem like a good deal, it's the cheapest price out there on the latest-generation model with the wireless charging case. The older model is also on sale. Either way, it's your best bet for saving money on the AirPods.</p>
