      <h1>Scarborough: GOP Hearing Defenses 'Laughable', Republicans 'Chasing Their Tails' | Breitbart</h1>

      <p>Thursday, MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough reacted to the first day of impeachment hearings, calling the GOP’s defenses “laughable.”</p>
      <p>According to Scarborough, testimony and “shocking revelations” from the day before blew “holes” in both the Republicans’ and White House’s defenses.</p>
      <p>“We had some new revelations, some pretty shocking revelations, and also, though, mainly a lot of steady testimony that continues to blow holes in the Republicans and the White House’s defense,” Scarborough outlined. “So, we’ll get to that in a little bit. It is something, though, how Republicans are chasing their tails and coming up with laughable defenses that will, once again, be proven false in the coming days.”</p>
      <p>He later added that Republicans shifted the narrative on hearsay when it was in their favor.</p>
      <p>“The dog continues to chase its tail and all we can do is sit back, look down amused, shaking our heads because the Republicans have no defense,” concluded Scarborough.</p>
