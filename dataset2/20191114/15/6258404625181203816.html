      <p>Google has announced that it has begun the rollout of its new SMS text messaging app with features powered by RCS (Rich Communication Services). Google says that some people had the chat features in their <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/android">Android</a> Messaging already, but the rollout is now going to everyone in the States.</p>
      <p>The traditional SMS text messaging features that Google has offered to Android users are getting new chat features, including the ability to chat over WiFi or using mobile data. Users will be able to send and receive high-resolution photos and videos, and see if people have received your latest messages.</p>

      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/google">Google</a> says that the update brings better group chats with the ability to name groups and add or remove people to and from groups, and see which people haven't received the latest messages. Users who already have Messages will be prompted to enable chat features in the coming weeks. If you don't have the Messages app, it can be downloaded on the Play Store. Google says that it expects the service to be available broadly in the U.S. by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Chat features in Messages were enabled earlier this year for anyone in the UK, France, and Mexico. Google promises to continue working to bring chat features to everyone around the world. Google also promises it is committed to working with its partners, including carriers and device makers, to provide a consistent and interoperable experience for everyone on Android. If you don't have RCS-powered Chat features on your device yet, you can enable it by following the steps <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/enable-rcs-on-andorid">here</a>.</p>
