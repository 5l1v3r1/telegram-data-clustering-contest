      <h1>Bella Italia is Serving up Christmas Dinner on a Pizza and it Sounds Awful</h1>

      <p>Bella Italia has unveiled its Christmas Party menu which includes the return of the pigs in blankets pizza and lasagne - now with pulled turkey.</p>
      <p>Honestly, you'd have to be a really big fan of the festive season to get on board with this, because it sounds horrendous. Available in pizza or lasagne form, the Pizza Festiva and Lasagne Festiva feature "pulled turkey confit, pigs in blankets, cranberry sauce and red onion," slapped on top of a classic pizza base, or - if you're feeling really brave - smooshed into the layers of a lasagne. Delightful.</p>
      <p>The items will be joined by other festive additions, like Chicken, Cranberry &amp; Pancetta Terrine, Roast Parsnip &amp; Chestnut Soup, and Pumpkin &amp; Pancetta Arancini. All of these are included in the <a href="https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/christmas">Christmas set menu</a> which offers two courses for £17.99 or three for £19.99.</p>
      <p>You won't have to wait too long to try these seasonal treats - both the Lasagne Festiva and Pizza Festiva will be available from November 19, so good luck with trying that.</p>
