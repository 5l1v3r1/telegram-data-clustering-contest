      <p>Netflix has released a super fun new trailer for<b> Michael Bay’</b>s new action-thriller <b><i>6 Underground</i></b>, and the trailer features <b>Ryan Reynolds </b>and his vigilante squad as they race through the streets of Italy during a crazy car chase in a neon green car. The scene is both action-packed and filled with some very funny humor. This movie looks like it’s going to be a blast!</p>
      <p>It’s been a long time since I’ve been excited about a Michael Bay movie! In the film, Reynolds plays one of six individuals who fake their deaths and form a vigilante squad. The whole point of the squad is so that they can take down some of the most notorious criminals in the world.</p>
      <p>Here’s the synopsis:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>What's the best part of being dead?<br/>It isn't escaping your boss, your ex, or even erasing your criminal record.<br/>The best part about being dead...is the freedom.<br/>The freedom to fight the injustice and evil that lurk in our world without anyone or anything to slow you down or tell you "no."</i>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <i>6 Underground introduces a new kind of action hero. Six individuals from all around the globe, each the very best at what they do, have been chosen not only for their skill, but for a unique desire to delete their pasts to change the future. The team is brought together by an enigmatic leader (Ryan Reynolds), whose sole mission in life is to ensure that, while he and his fellow operatives will never be remembered, their actions damn sure will.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i>6 Underground</i> was written by <i>Deadpool </i>writers <b>Paul Wernick </b>and <b>Rhett Reese</b>, and it also stars <b>Mélanie Laurent, Corey Hawkins, Adria Arjona, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Ben Hardy, Lior Raz, Payman Maadi</b>, and <b>Dave Franco</b>.</p>
      <p>The movie will be released on December 13th.</p>
