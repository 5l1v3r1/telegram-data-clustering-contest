      <p>An intruder attempted to steal two valuable paintings at a Rembrandt exhibition before spraying police with an unknown substance and fleeing.</p>
      <p>Officers were called at 11.30pm last night to reports of an alarm at Dulwich Picture Gallery.</p>
      <p>An intruder appeared to have forced entry into the gallery and removed the two paintings, which were part of an exhibition.</p>
      <p>But when the suspect was challenged by police, they used a canister to spray the officer in the face with an unknown substance.</p>
      <p>The suspect was then able to get away.</p>
      <p>Police say the officer who was sprayed did not suffer serious injuries and was able to continue working.</p>
      <p>Both paintings were later found.</p>

      <p>A Met Police statement said: "The officer located and recovered one painting, and in cooperation with security staff, the other painting was also quickly found.</p>
      <p>"Neither painting had left the gallery grounds and both remain in the gallery’s care.</p>
      <p>"Detectives from the Flying Squad are investigating."</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Jason Barber from the Flying Squad said: “This was an audacious attempted burglary and was clearly planned in advance. Two paintings in the exhibition were targeted and it was only down to the prompt response of gallery security staff and the courage and swift intervention of officers that these two works of art were not stolen. Thankfully both the paintings were quickly recovered and secured.”</p>
