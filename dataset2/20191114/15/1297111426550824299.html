      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-happy-80th-birthday-george-reed">George Reed</a> now has a portion of 10th Avenue renamed in his honour to accompany his statue outside Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders, the City of Regina and the Regina Exhibition Association Limited (REAL) announced Wednesday that a stretch of 10th Avenue on the north side of Mosaic Stadium, starting at Elphinstone Street through to Gate 2, has been renamed George Reed Way.</p>
      <p>In 2017, statues of Reed and quarterback <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gag_kiNBtc">Ron Lancaster</a>, another iconic Roughrider, were unveiled on the west side of Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>“If you think of the Saskatchewan Roughriders, two names automatically come to mind — George and Ronnie — and I had the privilege of playing with them for six years,” Roughriders alumni Dale West said.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEVC_-YVCQU">“George just exemplified everything that it is right about being a professional football player and being a great human being.”</a>

      <p>In addition to the unveiling of George Reed Way, Mosaic Stadium’s official address has been changed to 1734 George Reed Way.</p>
      <p>The last two digits are in recognition of Reed’s jersey No. 34, which he wore for 13 record-breaking seasons with the Green and White. No. 34 is one of eight numbers retired by the Riders.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhhmnvBK8iw">Riders president and CEO Craig Reynolds referred to Reed as “a living legend.”</a>
      </p>
      <p>“You can go anywhere in this country and they know George Reed and you don’t have to be a Rider fan,” Reynolds said. “If you know football, you know George Reed. It speaks to what he did on the field, but what he accomplished off the field as well.”</p>
      <p>Reed, 80, retired in the spring of 1976 with a CFL-record 16,116 rushing yards.</p>
      <p>He was a key part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpTBWmoBXzQ">the 1966 Grey Cup championship win</a>, rushing for 133 yards and a touchdown. The year before, he was named the CFL’s most outstanding player after rushing for a franchise-record 1,768 yards.</p>
      <p>Off the field, he created the George Reed Foundation, which focuses on helping the physically and intellectually disabled and the disadvantaged. He is also a long-time supporter of Special Olympics.</p>
      <p>“It’s one thing to be a football player,” West said. “It’s another thing to be a wonderful person. George has proven time and time again just how great a person that he is.”</p>
      <p>Reynolds didn’t rule out the possibility of Ron Lancaster Way being among the plans for Evraz Place.</p>
      <p>“With our 110th anniversary coming next year, we will really be looking at how we celebrate the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Riders greats,” Reynolds said.</p>
