      <p>A mice infestation at a Tamworth charity’s storage facility could hinder future fundraising events.</p>
      <p>The Mariposa Trust – which operates across the UK and internationally supporting anyone affected by the loss of a baby, at any stage of pregnancy, at birth or in infancy, whether recently or historically – is being badly affected by the rodents and has already lost many of its resources.</p>
      <p>Andy Clark-Coates, founder and CEO, said: “Sadly the problem has been very frustrating for all involved. The building owners have done their best to try and stop the mice, but the proximity to open fields means that you think it is sorted and then it continues all over again.</p>
      <p>“We have lost many resources and books and urgently need to move locations before the winter sets in.</p>

      <p>“We ideally need somewhere that we can move into during the first two weeks of December, due to staff being away over the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>“If we are unable to find somewhere, we would have to look at using container storage, however due to our requirements for access (roller shutter) with the ability to move pallets of stock and equipment in and out, and easily around, a container would be highly unsuitable, and hinder fundraising events that need easy access.</p>
      <p>“The charity is funded by the generous support of individuals and companies, and from fundraising events and projects that it runs, and as such needs quite a large area to store equipment and goods donated to the charity to be given/used at events.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“In addition, the charity runs a global series of events called the ‘Saying Goodbye’ services of remembrance at cathedrals around the world, and so there is equipment, resources and more associated to this area of its work.”</p>
      <p>Explaining how the problem came about, Mr Clark-Coates said: “A local trustee has given the use of a large garage for the past few years, but following a mouse invasion earlier in the year that resulted in damage to books and resources, and a continued problem that resulted in furniture and other goods being damaged, the charity is needing to find a larger facility, hopefully with less vermin.</p>
      <p>“Ideally we need a small workshop or industrial unit with a roller shutter entrance, as goods generally arrive on pallets, so have to be moved with a pallet truck. It needs to be at least 450 sq ft, so that there is room for racking and packing areas. The charity is hoping that there is a local company in Tamworth or Sutton Coldfield that has a suitable space that they could provide.”</p>
