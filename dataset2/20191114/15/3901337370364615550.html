      <p>A man growing in confidence with Orlando Pirates, Gabadinho Mhango recently scored a wonderful solo effort while on national team duty with Malawi. Did you see it?</p>
      <p>Pirates' results may have been indifferent in recent times, but Bucs fans can take solace in the fact that Mhango is among the few players beginning to find their feet this season.</p>

      <p>In fact, the former Bidvest Wits man was one of the stars who shone in the most recent Soweto Derby, and even managed to get his name on the scoresheet in the process.</p>
      <p>With some wind in his sails, Mhango's confidence at club level seemingly filtered through to his duty for Malawi recently as he managed to score a spectacular solo goal in his country's 1-0 win over South Sudan in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier this week.</p>
