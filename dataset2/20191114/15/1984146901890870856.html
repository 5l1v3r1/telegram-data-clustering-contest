      <p>Geordie Shore is known for its shock departures - there have been plenty over the years - and it looks like the latest series has brought another.</p>
      <p>While series 20 has just got going on MTV, filming for series 21 of the Newcastle-set reality show is already well under way.</p>
      <p>Months before it's due to air, the forthcoming series has already given us plenty to talk about, from the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/amelia-lily-joins-geordie-shore-17137727">shock casting of former X Factor star Amelia Lily</a> to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/geordie-shore-cast-new-boys-17255378">the arrival of two new lads,</a> one of whom is from nowhere near Newcastle!</p>
      <p>But this week has brought the most explosive moment to date, with the news that Bethan Kershaw has quit the show after a blazing row with boyfriend Beau Brennan.</p>
      <p>Former Ibiza Weekender star and beautician Bethan and Whitley Bay lad and civil engineer Beau both joined the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/geordie-shore">Geordie Shore</a> cast as newcomers earlier this year for series 19 and sparks quickly flew between them.</p>

      <p>They've already had an argument on screen in series 20 and, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10338964/geordie-shore-bethan-kershaw-quit-rows-boyfriend-beau/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunshowbizfacebook&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1573666513">The Sun</a> , tempers have flared again during filming for the new episodes, leading to Bethan storming out of the Geordie Shore house and off the show.</p>
      <p>A source told the paper: "Bethan and Beau got into a heated argument and things escalated really quickly.</p>
      <p>"It was one of the worst rows they have ever had - really explosive stuff. In the end, Bethan was very emotional and just walked. She's had enough.</p>
      <p>"The bosses are panicking because she is a great cast member and they really don't want to lose her."</p>
