      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it was ready to work with Bolivia’s new interim leader, but noted that she had come to power without having a full quorum in parliament.</p>
      <p>Jeanine Anez, the Senate vice-president, stepped in as interim leader on Tuesday after long-time president Evo Morales resigned under pressure on Sunday in what Russia has compared to an orchestrated coup.</p>
      <p>Moscow had good ties with Morales, who visited Russia for talks with President Vladimir Putin as recently as June.</p>
      <p>Anez was forced to declare herself president after legislators from Morales’ Movement for Socialism party boycotted her swearing in. She instead invoked a constitutional clause as the next person in line to succeed the president.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said “We noted... that at the moment of her confirmation in this role, there was not a full quorum so we see certain moments here that we will of course take into account,” RIA news agency reported.</p>
      <p>“But clearly, she will be recognized as Bolivia’s new leader until the question of a new president is resolved with elections,” he said.</p>
