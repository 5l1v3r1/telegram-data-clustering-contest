      <p>Microsoft and Salesforce today announced expanded partnership that will help their joint customers. As part of this partnership, Salesforce has announced Microsoft Azure as its public cloud provider for Marketing Cloud. Salesforce Marketing Cloud was previously available only on AWS and Google Cloud.</p>
      <p>Salesforce also announced new integration to connect Salesforce’s Sales Cloud and Service Cloud with Microsoft Teams. This integration will allow sales and service users to search, view, and share Salesforce records directly within Teams. This integration will be made available in late 2020.</p>
      <p>“In a world where every company is becoming a digital company, we want to enable every customer and partner to build experiences on our leading platforms,” said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft. “By bringing together the power of Azure and Microsoft Teams with Salesforce, our aim is to help businesses harness the power of the Microsoft Cloud to better serve customers.”</p>
      <p>“At Salesforce, we’re relentlessly focused on driving trust and success for our customers,” said Marc Benioff and Keith Block, co-CEOs, Salesforce. “We’re excited to expand our partnership with Microsoft and bring together the leading CRM with Azure and Teams to deliver incredible customer experiences.”</p>
