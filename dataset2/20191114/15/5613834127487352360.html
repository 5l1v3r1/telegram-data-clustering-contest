      <h1>Disney+ is Streaming “Gargoyles” Uncut and Uncensored, As the Show Originally Aired</h1>

      <p>While it was made for children, the ’90s animated series<b> “Gargoyles”</b> pushed the boundaries on a handful of occasions, most notably with the infamous episode <i>Deadly Force</i>. In the eighth episode of the very first season, the character Broadway picks up a handgun and accidentally shoots Elisa with it, and parental complaints led to the episode being banned.</p>
      <p>Similarly, bits and pieces from other episodes were edited out of “Gargoyles” for re-airings on Toon Disney and Disney XD, but the good news is that the just-launched<b> Disney+</b> is streaming all of the episodes fully uncensored. This tidbit comes via fan <a href="https://twitter.com/GregXB/status/1194235585701044224">Greg Bishansky</a>, who notes that this is the first time since the mid-90s that the show has aired in its uncut form.</p>
      <blockquote>Bishansky tweets, “Disney+ contains the uncut and uncensored Gargoyles! Not the Toon Disney/Disney XD edits. The show hasn’t aired in this format since the mid nineties, and was only available this way on DVD.”</blockquote>
      <p>On a related note, “Gargoyles” creator <a href="https://twitter.com/Greg_Weisman">Greg Weisman</a> is urging fans of the series to binge it on Disney+ and work together to get<b> #KeepBingingGargoyles</b> trending on Twitter. Weisman is hoping that the renewed interest in “Gargoyles” will perhaps lead Disney to order up a reboot.</p>
      <p>So if you love “Gargoyles,” get to streaming and let your voice be heard!</p>
