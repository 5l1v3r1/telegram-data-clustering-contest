      <h2>The investment was led by Silicon Valley venture capital giant, Accel</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:19:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Toronto-based password management software company, 1Password, announced that it raised <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/password-management-startup-announces-200-million-investment-to-grow-enterprise-business">$200 million USD</a> (approximately $265 million CAD) in venture capital.</p>
      <p>The investment comes from Silicon Valley venture capital giant, Accel. The company invests in startups and larger companies and has funded a number of tech companies including Facebook, Slack and Spotify.</p>
      <p>This is the first time that the startup has taken an outside investment in its <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/password-management-startup-announces-200-million-investment-to-grow-enterprise-business">14-year history</a>. It is entering the rapidly growing enterprise industry as it shifts from consumer markets.</p>
      <p>1Password offers a password-management service that generates and stores unique passwords for users to easily log into several accounts. Although the service started as a service for individuals and families, the company has been able to grow by offering its service to businesses.</p>
      <p>The company told the <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/password-management-startup-announces-200-million-investment-to-grow-enterprise-business"><i>Financial Post</i></a> that it has millions of users and that more than 50,000 companies use its service.</p>
      <p>1Password says this investment will allow it to sell its service to larger enterprise customers, as it believes that passwords are still a weak factor for a lot of companies.</p>
