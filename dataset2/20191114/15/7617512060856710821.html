      <h1>Barge grounded on Quadra Island won’t be refloated before weekend</h1>

      <p>An attempt to refloat the massive barge that ran aground on Quadra Island Saturday evening will not take place before the weekend.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, Transport Canada said it is working with the owner and a salvage contractor overseeing plans to refloat the Nana Provider. The department said it’s making sure the salvage contractor is aware of the water depths, environment and tidal currents in Discovery Passage as it develops a plan.</p>
      <p>Transport Canada is also investigating how the barge managed to run aground on the rocks on the southwest coast of the island, north of Cape Mudge.</p>
      <p>The Nana Provider was heading to Alaska when it hit rocks and damaged its hull.</p>
      <p>The barge was being pulled by a tugboat and was headed toward Whittier.</p>
      <p>The six people on board the tugboat were uninjured and the tug was not damaged.</p>
      <p>There are three loaded rail cars on board the Nana Provider — one contains compressed carbon dioxide, while the other two contain a corrosion inhibitor. All other rail cars and containers are empty, as is the hull.</p>
      <p>No pollution has been seen. The Canadian Coast Guard has said the situation is stable and there is little risk of pollution, as the cars are individually secured and raised above deck.</p>
      <p>A coast guard vessel remains at the scene to monitor the situation and ensure public safety.</p>
