      <h1>Ford’s all-electric SUV gets an official name: Mustang Mach-E</h1>
      <h2>Reservations will open on November 17th</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-j-hawkins" target="_blank">Andrew J. Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Ford’s all-electric Mustang-inspired SUV won’t be revealed to the public until November 17th, so, naturally, the slow drip-drip of information has begun. The company finally announced the vehicle’s official name — the Mustang Mach-E — and you’ll be able to reserve one for yourself starting this Sunday.</p>
      <p>For a while, Ford was using the codename “Mach 1” to refer to the electric SUV. “Mach E” was also a name that was rumored to be under consideration. Now, we have the official name, making it clear that the Blue Oval isn’t big on surprises or misdirection.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930394/ford-mustang-electric-suv-mach-e-reveal-date">The big debut</a>, hosted by actor Idris Elba, will help kick off the annual Los Angeles Auto Show starting next week. As soon as the event is over at approximately 6:30PM PT / 9:30PM ET, reservations will open at <a href="http://Ford.com/">Ford.com</a>. Customers will have to drop $500 to reserve the Mustang Mach-E, though the deposits are refundable. A “limited first edition” version of the vehicle will also be available to the first customers.</p>
      <p>The new vehicle, which is expected to have around 300 miles of range, has been <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/366388/ford-mustang-electric-suv-spied/">spotted a number of times</a> in recent months in testing camouflage. There’s been <a href="https://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2019/10/key-details-about-fords-mustang-inspired-suv-leak-out/">speculation</a> that it will cost around $50,000, come in short- and long-range variants, and be available in rear or all-wheel drive configurations.</p>
      <p><i>Jalopnik</i> actually has a set of pictures featuring the car still in camouflaged wrap. Here’s one and you can see more <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-ford-mustang-inspired-suv-caught-almost-tot-1839701061">at this link</a>.</p>

      <p>The Mustang Mach-E represents the tip of the spear of Ford’s ambitious $11 billion push to electrify its entire lineup. Ford has said it would introduce up to 40 all-electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022 (across all of Ford’s global markets). The company has already teasing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706515/ford-electric-f150-pickup-truck-pull-million-pound-train">an all-electric F-150 truck</a> that is expected to follow the SUV into the market.</p>
      <p>But the company is already looking beyond these initial EVs. Ford said last April that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech">build an electric SUV using tech from EV startup Rivian</a> as part of a $500 million investment. Ford is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation">partnering with Volkswagen,</a> and it will build at least one electric vehicle using Volkswagen’s modular EV platform.</p>
