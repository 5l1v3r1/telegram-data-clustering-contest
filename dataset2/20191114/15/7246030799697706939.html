      <h1>Court Orders Neria Zarog Freed from Police Custody</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:25:37+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/newsbriefs/" target="_blank">Jewish Press News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Lod district court judge Hagai Tarsi dismissed a police appeal and ordered the release of administrative detainee Neria Zarog from detention.</p>
      <p>Zarog, age 21, was arrested after he refused to comply with an IDF administrative order forbidding him entry into the northern Shomron, which is where he lives with his wife and child. Zarog is a shepherd.</p>
      <p>No explanation has been given for the administrative order, and all attempts to get it cancelled were denied. Some suspect the order is the result of Zarog building his home in Area B, an area where the army has no authority to destroy it.</p>
      <p>In protest, Zarog announced he was staying in Yitzhar and was defying the order. He locked and chained himself into a building in Yitzhar.</p>
      <p>A massive police force was brought to Yitzhar to find and arrest him.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of Yitzhar residents came out to protest the arrest. Police, protesters and <a href="https://www.jewishpress.com/news/police-news/police-engage-in-5-hour-stand-off-during-arrest-of-yitzhar-resident-15-injured/2019/11/11/">Zarog, who was chained down</a>, were injured in the protest and subsequent arrest.</p>
      <p>At the request of the state representative, Zarogâ€™s release will be delayed until tomorrow for the purpose of appealing to the Supreme Court to get the ruling overturned.</p>
