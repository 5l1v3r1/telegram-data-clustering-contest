      <p>Following the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/07/apple-releases-ios-13-2-2/">iOS 13.2.2 on November 7</a>, Apple has stopped signing iOS 13.2, which means downgrading to iOS 13.2 is no longer possible. <br/><br/>iOS 13.2 was a major update that brought support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, added new emojis, and introduced Deep Fusion support for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a> and 11 Pro. <br/><br/>Apple routinely stops signing older versions of software updates after new releases come out in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date. <br/><br/>iOS 13.2.2 is the current public version of iOS. iOS 13.2.2 is a bug fix release that addresses an issue that caused apps running in the background to unexpectedly quit, leading to background apps refreshing more often than normal. <br/><br/>The update also fixes a few other bugs with cellular connectivity, cellular data, Safari, and more. <br/><br/>Developers and public beta testers can also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/12/apple-seeds-ios-13-3-beta-2-to-developers/">download iOS 13.3</a>, an upcoming update that introduces Communication Limits for Screen Time and a handful of other tweaks and changes.</p>
