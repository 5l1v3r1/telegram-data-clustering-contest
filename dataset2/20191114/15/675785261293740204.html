      <h1>Bayern Munich told Pep Guardiola is 'best solution' amid return rumours</h1>
      <h2>The Spaniard has been linked with a return to the Bundesliga with Bayern after their recent sacking of Niko Kovac has left Hansi Flick in temporary charge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:31:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bayern-munich">Bayern Munich</a> have been urged to re-appoint <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> as manager, by club legend Lothar Matthuas.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> boss enjoyed three successful years with the German club from 2013-16, winning back-to-back Bundesliga titles in each season.</p>
      <p>He is also said to still be in close contact with Bayern's owners, while his family is reportedly unsettled in Manchester.</p>
      <p>And following the sacking of Niko Kovac, Matthaus feels a return for Guardiola to Bavaria would be an ideal fit.</p>
      <p>Matthaus told Bild: "If Bayern want to play possession football, there is no better solution than Guardiola.</p>

      <p>"It would be a win for Bayern Munich and for the Bundesliga."</p>
      <p>Guardiola is under contract with City until the end of the 2020-21 campaign, and there is currently no suggestion he is considering departing the Etihad.</p>
      <p>However should he stay at the Sky Blues beyond this season, it will be his longest reign at any of the clubs he has managed.</p>

      <p>Bild also claim that Guardiola still owns a flat in the centre of Munich, where his wife Cristina and their three children felt at home.</p>
      <p>Cristina has recently returned to Spain to live, after failing to settle in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has already broke his own three-year rule by staying for a fourth season with Man City, after previously admitting his regret at prolonging his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> tenure, before ending his time at Bayern after three seasons.</p>
      <p>Bayern are currently under the caretaker stewardship of Hans-Dieter Flick, who was operating as Kovac's assistant before his sacking.</p>
      <p>Flick has led Bayern to two wins in two matches so far, after a heavy 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt was enough to convince the club's board to part ways with Kovac.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed that Flick will remain in charge "until further notice, giving him a chance to stake a claim for the post on a permanent basis.</p>
