        <i>The Design Museum’s Deyan Sudjic was granted access to the legendary Italian house’s archives and headquarters in Milan for upcoming exhibition Prada. Front and Back</i>
      </p>
      <p>London’s Design Museum has announced that its September 2020 exhibition will focus on Prada, the institution having been granted access to the Italian fashion house’s Milanese archives and headquarters – marking the first time a major museum has dedicated an exhibition to Prada. Titled <b><i>Prada. Front and Back</i></b>, the exhibition promises a look at both the collections, clothing and accessories produced by the house, as well as the company’s ever-growing infrastructure, in an unprecedented behind-the-scenes exploration of <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/prada">Prada</a>.</p>
      <p>Deyan Sudjic has curated the exhibition (it marks Sudjic’s final show as co-director of the <a href="https://designmuseum.org/">Design Museum</a>, a role he is stepping down from in January 2020). “For me, it’s a particularly personal challenge to work on the Prada exhibition – there is so much to explore about a company that never wants to do the obvious thing, and that is such a genuine cultural force,” he says.</p>
      <p>At the exhibition’s core, of course, will be <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/tag/miuccia-prada">Miuccia Prada</a>, who joined her family’s business in the 1970s and first introduced ready-to-wear in 1988. <i>Prada. Front and Back</i> will trace the extraordinary trajectory that Mrs Prada has engineered for the house: taking it from luggage and leather goods to one of the world’s most recognised and revolutionary luxury fashion houses, alongside her husband and co-CEO Patrizio Bertelli. “She has made Prada the essence of modernity,” says the Design Museum.</p>
