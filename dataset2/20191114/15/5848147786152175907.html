      <h1>‘A horrible map to look at’: No rain as Australia enters grim summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:27:12+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/robyn-wuth/" target="_blank">Robyn Wuth</a></address>
      <p>Australia is staring down the barrel of a horrific summer season that will drag scorching temperatures and extreme conditions well into the new year.</p>
      <p>Livio Remano has never seen such extreme conditions in the 20 years he has worked with the Bureau of Meteorology, comparing the long term seasonal outlook to a bad chest X-ray.</p>
      <p>“It’s horrible, it’s a horrible map to look at,” he said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I have never seen this before in my life … the entire country of Australia is covered in deep red.”</p>
      <p>That red colour means 70 to 80 per cent of the country is experiencing above-average temperatures, and is being blamed on something called an extremely positive Indian Ocean Diode.</p>
      <p>Westerly winds weaken along the equator and push warm water to shift towards Africa during a typical IOD.</p>
      <p>The wind changes allow cool water to rise from the depths of the ocean in the east, causing a temperature difference across the tropical Indian Ocean, with unusually cooler water in the east and warmer in the west.</p>
      <p>It means atmospheric moisture levels drop in Australia’s northwest, which alters the path of weather systems coming from Australia’s west.</p>
      <p>The result is less rainfall and higher than normal temperatures over parts of Australia.</p>
      <p>Queensland is moving into its wet season but there is little chance of significant rainfall until January.</p>
      <p>But eventually, Mr Remano says the rain will come.</p>
      <p>Whatever rain does fall will be isolated and could cause more harm than good with the threat of dry lightning strikes sparking new fires.</p>
      <p>“What we need is English rain, but it is not forthcoming – certainly not anytime soon,” he added.</p>
