        <b>India pacer R Vinay Kumar has expressed his shock on the match fixing fiasco in the KPL as he said that he never expected any such thing to happen in Karnataka as he also stressed that it has a negative impact on youngsters. Kumar has moved to Pondicherry this season from Karnataka, after 15 years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The allegations of match fixing in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) and the arrests of CM Gautam and Abrar Kazi has left a deep impact on the cricketing fraternity of the state which bagged the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/vijay_hazare_trophy">Vijay </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/hazare_trophy">Hazare Trophy</a> this season. The veteran Indian pacer R <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/vinay_kumar">Vinay Kumar</a>, who is a prominent face in Karnataka cricket has expressed his shock over the fiasco. </p>
      <p>The Central Crime Branch (CCB) has alleged that the arrested players Gautam and Kazi were offered a sum of 20 lakh for batting slow in the final of the season against Hubli Tigers, which the Tigers eventually won by just eight runs.</p>
      <p>“It’s really sad. We did not think that such things will happen to Karnataka. Whoever has done something wrong, needs to be punished,” Vinay told Sportstar. </p>
      <p>“I am really hurt with whatever has happened. It should not have happened. You feel bad,” Vinay, who was the captain of the Hubli Tigers in the KPL, said.</p>
      <p>Vinay then went on to explain how the scandal would affect the youngsters and has tarnished the reputation of the state board.</p>
      <p>“It’s not good for cricket, especially for the youngsters who are coming to play for Karnataka. They have seen players as their role models and if they know about such things, it leaves a bad impression. But there are very good examples also, who went on to play for India. They performed and waved the Karnataka flag at the international stage, so these small incidents could hurt their feelings, but I am sure, things will get better.”</p>
      <p>The experienced speedster who has 31 ODIs, nine T20Is and one Test for India under his belt moved to Pondicherry this season after serving Karnataka cricket for 15 long years. Kumar praises the calibre of the youngsters in the team as he expressed his joy of enjoying his role in the side.</p>
      <p>“The experience has been really good. We qualified for the quarterfinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, but unfortunately, we lost the game against Karnataka — my previous team.</p>
      <p>”If you see that game, had we bowled first, we could have given a better fight. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament, we can’t take any teams lightly. T20 is all about two guys clicking with the bat or the ball. Defending 120 in the first match shows the kind of calibre these guys have and I am really enjoying my role,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kumar who is looking to play mentor to the youngsters in the team stressed that youngsters are getting better day by day.</p>
      <p>“If I talk to fast, bowlers, I need to understand their mindset and make them understand their roles. They have to keep things simple. It’s a young side but is quite a talented side. They are getting better day by day.”</p>
