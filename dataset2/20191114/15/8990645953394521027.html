      <p>With Turkey Day two weeks away, what recipes are you searching for? What do you think is the top recipe search for the state?</p>
      <p>Using Google Trends, <a href="https://housemethod.com/lifestyle/most-popular-thanksgiving-recipes-state/">House Method</a> compiled their list of the most searched main and desert dishes for the upcoming fall feast.</p>
      <p>As the turkey is the main focal point for the meal, its understandable that it would be the most searched dish in the country, topping the list in nearly 1/5 of states, but not in Texas. For the Lonestar State, its all about the dressing.</p>

      <p>On the desert side, it should come as no surprise that Texas and most of the states that searched for dressing were also searching for the best recipe for Pecan Pie.</p>
      <p>What's your favorite Thanksgiving dish? Any new recipes you're trying out this year?</p>
