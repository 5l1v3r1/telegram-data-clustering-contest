      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov is known as one of the most dominant fighters in the sport today. But according to the undefeated UFC lightweight champion, he never really enjoyed inflicting pain on his opponents.</p>
      <p>“I had fights in my career where I understood that I could hurt my opponent more, but I’d talk to him, tell him to give up so that I don’t beat him too hard,” he said in his native language (via RT Sport).</p>
      <p>“For example, if I had a painful hold where I could break something, I wouldn’t tighten it all the way. I’d just fix it so that the opponent would tap out. Because I have no aim to hurt anyone in this sport.</p>

      <p>“Yes, we compete in a very brutal contact sport,” he added. “But it’s never my goal to inflict a lot of pain on my opponent. If I understand that I’m winning, I don’t aim to hurt someone bad.”</p>
      <p>“The Eagle,” however, made an exception to this mindset for Conor McGregor, whom he says he took pleasure in beating.</p>
      <p>“Well, with the exception of one fight. Let’s say in that fight, I beat that guy with pleasure, I’ll tell you.”</p>
      <p>Khabib is still deciding on whom he will fight next, but he says there is a “<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956774/ufc-mma-news-video-twitter-press-conference-russia-khabib-nurmagomedov-tony-ferguson-fight">95 percent chance</a>” it would be Tony Ferguson.</p>
