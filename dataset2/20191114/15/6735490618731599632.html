      <p>The 23-year-old will be under supervision, reporting to a parole office until the end of her sentence in 2024.</p>
      <p>Kelley was originally sentenced for violating probation following a 2017 drug-related conviction. Kelley had reportedly left her court-mandated recovery program, leading to the warrant for her arrest.</p>
      <p>In May 2017, Kelley pled guilty to meth manufacture, delivery, sale and possession on charges stemming from a 2015 arrest. She was originally sentenced to serve nearly 12 months in jail, but her sentence was suspended and she was placed on probation.</p>
