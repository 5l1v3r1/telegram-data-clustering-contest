      <h1>How Style Can Help You Land the Job You Want</h1>

      <p>Every day on the job is different for 25-year-old <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hansmils/?hl=en">Hannah Miller</a>—and that's how she likes it. "I couldn't just sit at a desk all day—I would go crazy," she says. Miller is a photo producer for Hearst Digital, where she produces all of the branded content shoots (including for <i>ELLE</i>)!</p>
      <p>"It's nice always being on my feet and going places," Miller says. About half of her week is spent on set, which could be in a studio setting <i>or</i> traveling abroad, depending on the client and shoot. Whether she's picking up props before heading into the office or working on set at a gorgeous mansion in New Jersey, Miller's personal style is top of mind.</p>
      <p>"I think that fashion and the way you dress is such a powerful tool," she says. "Dressing up in a way that makes me feel confident and good shows on the outside, and it helps me feel like I'm being taken seriously."</p>
      <p>Since she <i>does</i> spend the majority of her time at work on her feet and moving around, it's very important to Miller that she's wearing a comfortable pair of shoes. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525074&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN5092.Chron%2FB23166838.259897201%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D455633035%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D121176714%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Ffashion%2Fa29607761%2Fstyle-dressing-for-job-sorel%2F">SOREL Cate Lace booties</a>, for example, are comfy enough to get her from the office to photoshoots and fashionable enough to stand up to her work attire.</p>

      <p>"Being in something that's stylish, yet comfy is really important," she says. "<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525074&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN5092.Chron%2FB23166838.259897201%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D455633035%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D121176714%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Ffashion%2Fa29607761%2Fstyle-dressing-for-job-sorel%2F">These<b> </b>are great </a>because they have a little bit of height, but they're still very, very walkable and I think that's the best of both worlds for my day-to-day at the office."</p>

      <p>You know how they say, "Dress for the job you want, not the job you have"? We think it's important to do both. "Even just dressing in a way that's appropriate and professional shows that you're there for the job and that you're capable of so many things," Miller says.</p>
      <p>While you're finessing your personal style (because aren't we always), take a cue from people in your office. "I feel so lucky to get to go to work at a place where just the people around the office offer so much inspiration," she says. "I'm constantly like, <i>Omg—I love that skirt or blazer</i>. Incorporating special pieces into my own style makes me feel like I belong among this place of powerful creatives."</p>

      <h3>Know What Works for You—and Work It</h3>

      <p>"It's so important to find what you like about your body and accentuate that, because that's the way to make yourself feel confident," Miller says. For her, wearing something like this matching set that shows off her legs—plus the added height from the shoes—allows her to walk into a room and feel empowered.</p>
      <p>"I think sometimes it's 'look good, feel good,'" she says. White tees are a staple for Miller, too. "When you're wearing something a little more dressed up, throwing on a white tee underneath makes it a bit more casual." And she would know—she has about 50 in her closet.</p>
      <p>Another tip: It's always good to wear a light-colored shoe like the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525074&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN5092.Chron%2FB23166838.259897201%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D455633035%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D121176714%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Ffashion%2Fa29607761%2Fstyle-dressing-for-job-sorel%2F">SORELs</a> with a skirt, Miller says, so it doesn't cut your leg off in an awkward way.</p>

      <p>For Miller, working in fashion and a creative industry means she can play with fun prints and more casual looks at work, too. Here, she pairs her "favorite jeans ever" with a silk button down and blazer coat that give the denim a more polished look. With the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525074&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fad.doubleclick.net%2Fddm%2Ftrackclk%2FN5092.Chron%2FB23166838.259897201%3Bdc_trk_aid%3D455633035%3Bdc_trk_cid%3D121176714%3Bdc_lat%3D%3Bdc_rdid%3D%3Btag_for_child_directed_treatment%3D%3Btfua%3D&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Ffashion%2Fa29607761%2Fstyle-dressing-for-job-sorel%2F">SOREL booties</a>, this is an outfit that Miller could easily get around in—from a shoot on-location back to the office.</p>
