      <h2>Decades-old campaign financing rules make it harder to distinguish between national and local spending, and keep track of who’s buying election ads on social media.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:26:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Scott</a></address>
      <p>LONDON — British political parties are testing the country's electoral spending rules by using sophisticated social media campaigning tactics to woo potential voters, according to a review of the groups' paid-for social media messages by POLITICO.</p>
      <p>The strategies focus on taking advantage of loopholes in the United Kingdom's decades-old campaign-financing rules, which separate political parties' spending from that of local candidates. These gaps allow national campaigns to buy paid-for messages in local constituencies that may breach existing electoral law.</p>
      <p>British political parties have regularly paid for partisan messages on behalf of their candidates, often through paper leaflets promoting the parties' wider electoral themes delivered to people's homes.</p>
      <p>But the level of sophistication in targeting would-be voters offered by social media companies like Facebook — which have reams of data on their users — has made such tactics both more widespread and more cost-effective for parties aiming to reach potential supporters. All British political parties now advertise on social media; Facebook in particular has garnered roughly 80 percent of such political ads, according to a POLITICO analysis of companies’ transparency reports.</p>
      <p>That has made it easier to blur the lines between national and local spending, and harder to keep track of who's buying these paid-for ads that target voters online.</p>
      <aside>"Everyone is playing around with the spending limits" <i>— Sam Jeffers, co-founder of WhoTargetsMe</i></aside>
      <p>"Are they testing the boundaries of legality? Almost certainly," said <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/justin-fisher">Justin Fisher</a>, a professor of political science at Brunel University, in reference to how national campaigns are buying social media ads on behalf of local candidates. "But would a more regulated system be better? Probably not."</p>
      <p>Fisher explained that forcing political parties to be more overtly transparent about their funding practices would likely not solve the problem, and could instead force a greater regulatory burden on smaller parties compared with their bigger rivals.</p>
      <p>Under Britain's existing campaign-financing rules, national political parties <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50170067">can spend</a> up to £19.5 million on the December 12 election, as long as they stand a candidate in each of the country's 650 constituencies. These funds can be used on nationwide advertising campaigns, partisan messaging (both online and offline), rallies and other political activity. They cannot be used to help the electoral prospects of a specific candidate.</p>
      <p>Additionally, each local candidate <a href="https://fullfact.org/law/election-spending-rules-conservatives-electoral-commission/">can spend</a> roughly £16,000 (the figure depends on the number of registered voters in the constituency) on their own advertising, public meetings and administrative costs, with would-be lawmakers facing fines or disqualification if they breach that limit.</p>

      <p>"Everyone is playing around with the spending limits," said Sam Jeffers, co-founder of <a href="https://whotargets.me/">WhoTargetsMe</a>, a British organization that relies on people downloading software onto their computers so the group can track political advertising on individuals' Facebook pages. "It's now a common practice."</p>
      <h3>Conservative and Labour spending</h3>
      <p>The Conservatives and Labour Party have taken center stage in testing the U.K.'s creaking electoral rules.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, both parties' national campaigns have used their funds to purchase social media ads that promoted specific local candidates or attacked their direct opponents, according to a review of the Facebook's transparency records. Such spending, if not correctly allocated to these candidates, may have breached the country's campaign financing rules.</p>
      <p>In Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Uxbridge constituency, for instance, the Conservative Party <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=GB&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=7972991316">paid up to £5,000 for a Facebook ad</a> — that ran between October 11 and November 3 — to promote his support to keep a local police station open. In the online video, Johnson stands along a main road in his constituency, mixing local messages about his backing for the local police station with national campaign slogans related to Brexit.</p>
      <p>In early November, the party also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=GB&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=8807334278">bought a series of Facebook paid-for messages</a> that promoted individual candidates in several marginal constituencies across the country, although it was unclear how the spending was attributed to either the national or local campaigns.</p>
      <p>Labour also has pushed the limits of what is allowed under U.K. law, including the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=GB&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=25749647410">purchase of up to £299 worth of social media ads</a> by the party's national campaign to attack Francesca O'Brien, a Tory candidate standing in Gower, a Labour-held Welsh seat with a 3,000-person majority that voted 50/50 to leave the European Union during the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p>

      <p>Electoral rules experts say that such activities, though in a gray legal area, may still be permitted, as long as local candidates reimburse their parties' national campaigns for any social media ad-buys.</p>
      <p>Representatives for both the Conservative Party and Labour Party did not respond to repeated calls for comment. There is no evidence that either campaign has done anything illegal. Campaign-expense documents will only be made public months after the upcoming December election.</p>
      <p>Each candidate has a month to turn in their electoral spending to local returning officers, while national campaigns have until next<b> </b>summer to send their separate receipts to the country's Electoral Commission. The agency then will cross-check both local and national spending, though it doesn't have the powers to prosecute possible infractions.</p>
      <p>But with much of digital campaign spending remaining opaque and reliant on political parties volunteering information about their online activities, pressure is again growing for a major overhaul of the country's campaign laws to remove any doubt over who is funding such ad-buys, and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-general-election-facebook-misinformation-boris-johnson-interference-russia/">questions are being raised</a> on whether the U.K.'s electoral standards are fit for the digital age.</p>
      <p>"The real problem with control of election spending — which is supposed to produce a level playing field — is that the law, which substantially dates from the 19th century and was updated in 2000, fails to cope with the realities of digital election campaigning," said <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/people/bob-watt">Bob Watt</a>, an academic at the University of Oxford whose work specializes in updating the U.K.'s electoral rules. "The law is badly in need of reform."</p>
