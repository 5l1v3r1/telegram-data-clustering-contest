      <p>Japanese company Hamster has been doing sterling work of late bringing classic arcade titles to the Switch via its Arcade Archives line, and it's lining up a release for one of Irem's most loved shooters.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_in_the_hunt">In The Hunt</a></b> – known in Japan as <b>Kaitei Daisensō</b> – was originally released in 1993 and was developed by the same core team that would later part company with Irem and form Nazca – the studio which created SNK's <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/metal_slug">Metal Slug</a></b> series.</p>
      <p>While the gameplay is obviously different from that seminal run-and-gun blaster – this is an underwater, side-scrolling shooter – the similarity in the visual style is clear to see. In The Hunt features some incredible 2D sprite work and gorgeous level design. It was ported to the PlayStation, Saturn and Windows PC back in the day.</p>
      <p>The title will hit the Japanese eShop on November 21st, with a price of ¥838.</p>
