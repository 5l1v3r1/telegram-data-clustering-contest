      <p>PITTSBURGH -- Penguins star Sidney Crosby will be out at least six weeks after what the team said was a successful core muscle injury repair Thursday.</p>
      <p>General manager Jim Rutherford says the procedure was performed by Dr. William Meyers in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Crosby leads the team in scoring with five goals and 12 assists in 17 games despite dealing with a sports hernia since training camp.</p>
      <p>The two-time MVP left a 3-2 shootout win over Chicago on Nov. 9 in the third period. He got tangled up with Blackhawks defenceman Erik Gustafsson and moments later took a shot from Gustafsson that smacked off his right foot.</p>
