      <h2>Honey, Obsidian shrunk the gamers!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:20:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/kris-holt" target="_blank">Kris Holt</a></address>
      <p>If <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/gaming-irl-outer-worlds-destiny-2/">The Outer Worlds</a></i> has got you excited to play whatever Obsidian Entertainment's cooking up next, you won't have to wait too much longer. Its first-person survival title, <i>Grounded</i>, will arrive on Xbox Game Preview next spring.</p>
      <p>You'll endure the terrors and dangers of life in a suburban backyard, but it won't necessarily be all sun loungers and barbeques. Your character will be shrunk to the size of an ant -- I'm getting some serious <i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</i> vibes with this one. You'll need to scavenge for objects to build a base with, scrounge for life-saving resources and try to co-exist with friendly insects while fending off giant beasts.</p>

      <p>Obsidian, which Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/10/microsoft-studios-fallout-new-vegas-wasteland-obsidian-inxile/">bought last year</a>, says <i>Grounded </i>is a sandbox title, though it'll include environmental and narrative-driven storytelling elements. You can explore and try to stay alive by yourself or with up to three friends in co-op multiplayer.</p>
      <p><i>Grounded </i>is the first Xbox Game Preview title that'll be available with Xbox Game Pass. You can also pick it up via the Microsoft Store or Steam.</p>
