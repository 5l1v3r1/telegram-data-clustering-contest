      <h1>Plymouth Argyle playmaker Danny Mayor makes promise to Green Army over his form</h1>
      <h2>The 29-year-old signed for the Pilgrims in the summer with very high expectations for him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:42:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle midfield playmaker Danny Mayor has promised there is ‘definitely more to come’ from him performance-wise.</p>
      <p>By his own admission, the 29-year-old has had an up and down start to his first season at Home Park.</p>
      <p>Promotion from League Two remains the aim for Mayor, who has been a marked man for the opposition.</p>
      <p>That has led to him being kicked time after time to try and stop him but he has vowed to ‘just keep getting up’.</p>
      <p>There was much excitement among the Green Army when Mayor followed manager Ryan Lowe from Bury to Argyle this summer.</p>
      <p>Widely regarded as one of the best players in League Two there were very high expectations for him.</p>
      <p>Mayor has shown some good form for Argyle at times but consistency has been an issue for him.</p>
      <p>He said: “There were a couple of things off the pitch that I wouldn’t say distracted me but made it a bit more difficult.</p>
      <p>“I think it has been up and down really, not the form that I wanted. There is definitely more to come.”</p>
      <p>Mayor does not mind being picked out as the Pilgrims’ main man by opposing sides, who believe if they can stop him they can stop Argyle.</p>
      <p>“If that’s what they are saying then, of course, I’m happy with it because it means I’m doing something right, but we have got a lot of good players at Argyle,” he said.</p>
      <p>Often that has led to Mayor being repeatedly fouled, without much in the way of protection from referees.</p>

      <p>“I just try not to react,” he said. “I did it last season and the Gaffer (Lowe) lynched me so I can’t really do it again.</p>
      <p>“I figure if you are getting kicked then you must be playing alright. Take it on the chin and just keep getting up.”</p>
      <p>Mayor has spent most of his football in his native north-west of England.</p>
      <p>He has no regrets about deciding to move to the opposite end of the country to play for Argyle.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m loving it down here. I have to admit I did think I would maybe struggle.</p>
      <p>“I have not left home for a couple of years. I have never moved this far south. I feel like I’m in France.</p>
      <p>“I actually love it. It is different and I can do stuff with my little boy that you can’t do up north so I’m very relaxed down here.”</p>
      <p>Mayor was one of five Bury players who were brought to Home Park by Lowe following their promotion-winning campaign in League Two last season.</p>
      <p>He believes they have settled in well at their new club and that another promotion is their collective target.</p>
      <p>Mayor said: “There is absolutely no cliques. I have come down here with all the Bury lot, but some of the lads that I get on with were here last year.</p>
      <p>“I get on really well with Joe (Riley), he’s my room-mate.</p>
      <p>“The Gaffer always says it doesn’t matter about ability, he wants to sign good lads and that’s what he has got here.</p>
      <p>“Everyone wants the same thing. Everyone wants to push forward and get promoted.”</p>
      <p>Mayor returned to Argyle’s starting line-up for the 1-0 FA Cup first round win at Bolton Wanderers last Saturday.</p>
      <p>Initially, he had to serve a one-match suspension for the 2-0 home league win against Carlisle United on October 19 after being booked five times this season.</p>
      <p>He then played as a second half substitute in the next two games, including the 4-0 Devon Derby drubbing at Exeter City, due to the form of George Cooper.</p>
      <p>Mayor understood why Lowe went for Cooper instead of him for those matches, but was glad to get recalled against Bolton.</p>
      <p>He said: “I love playing football. That’s what I have come down here to do.</p>
      <p>“I knew the Gaffer couldn’t change it. Coops was playing unbelievable. I accepted that and I bided my time, but I’m glad to be back on the pitch.”</p>
      <p>Mayor added: “I just want us to win games and if George is the one who is setting up goals then he deserves his place.</p>
      <p>“The aim is to get promotion, whatever team we field. It’s definitely good to have George pushing me and me pushing him.”</p>
      <p>Argyle return to League Two action on Saturday with a difficult task awaiting them at table-topping Forest Green Rovers.</p>

      <p>Forest Green were beaten play-off semi-finalists under Mark Cooper last term and they are making another strong push for promotion this time around.</p>
      <p>Mayor said: “I will be honest, I don’t know much about them this season. I know they are doing well, and they were a good team last season.</p>
      <p>“As well as us (Bury), they were one of the better teams at playing football. They did it really well and they have carried on.”</p>
