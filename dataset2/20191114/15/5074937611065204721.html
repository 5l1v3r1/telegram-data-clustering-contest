      <p>He said over the past six years, in line with the organisation's culture, it had been supporting the GJA, which it considered a key partner,</p>
      <p>He advised media practitioners to give of their best in their respective fields, saying success could not be achieved in a vacuum but through hardwork, discipline and team work.</p>
      <p>Mr Affail Monney, President of the GJA, expressed his appreciation on behalf of the Association, and commended them for their consistent support.</p>
