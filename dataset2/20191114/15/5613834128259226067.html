      <h1>Like ‘RE2’, ‘Devil May Cry 5’ Also Receiving Additional DLC Content?</h1>

      <p>It seems that <b><i>Resident Evil 2</i></b> might not be the only one to be in line for more DLC.</p>
      <p>After it was made known that Capcom <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3593927/new-resident-evil-2-dlc-way/">added a hidden achievement in the latest update</a> to their successful remake of the survival horror classic, <b><i>Devil May Cry 5</i></b> has also received a similar update. According to the game’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/601150/history/">Steam database</a> page, a new changelist update includes entries for multiplayer, PvP and Co-op play. And like <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, Capcom has said nothing about any additional DLC for <i>DMC5</i>.</p>
      <p>One could speculate that like <i>RE2</i>, Capcom is simply gearing up for a “Gold Edition” for <i>DMC5</i>, which has to date has sold over 2.5 million units worldwide. But, until Capcom says anything, we’ll just have to wait.</p>
