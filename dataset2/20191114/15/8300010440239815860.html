      <p>SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Los Angeles police detectives are investigating after chilling footage of an apparent kidnapping in South Los Angeles was posted to social media.<br/><br/>Police responded to a possible kidnapping in the 3800 block of Third Avenue in the Leimert Park area around 11 p.m. Tuesday. Upon arrival, officers did not find evidence of a kidnapping, according to the LAPD.<br/><br/>In the video, a woman can be heard screaming for help several times and saying, "Somebody help me please!"<br/><br/>Police said they have been aware of the footage, caught on a neighbor's doorbell security system, and were canvassing the neighborhood looking for new leads. The residents whose camera captured the alleged incident were seen rushing out of their home as a white four-door Toyota Prius with a broken front passenger window sped away from the neighborhood.<br/><br/>"I'm bothered and I'm rarely bothered," said witness Denise Bingham. "I'm all shook up. I'm shaken up just talking about it. Her screams I can't forget it. I can't forget it."<br/><br/>Anyone with information can contact LAPD detectives at 213-485-6570.<br/><br/><i>Video of the incident is part of an ongoing investigation.</i></p>
