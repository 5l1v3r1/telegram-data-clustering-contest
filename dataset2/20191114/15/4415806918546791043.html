      <h1>NTA accused of 'gross mismanagement' for paying agency staff double what it's paying its own staff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:19:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/daniel-mcconnell/" target="_blank">By Daniel McConnell</a></address>
      <p>The National Transport Authority has been accused of “gross mismanagement” after it emerged it is paying agency staff working for it double what it is paying its own full-time staff.</p>
      <p>At a meeting of the Dail's spending watchdog this morning, the NTA was slammed after the body confirmed that the number of agency staff far exceeds the number of full-time staff.</p>
      <p>The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) heard that on average full-time staff at the NTA are paid about €73,000 a year including PRSI and pension payments, while the average cost of each agency worker is nearly €140,000.</p>
      <p>It was further explained to the committee that the vast majority of these agency workers are not performing specialised work but fulfilling “day-to-day” activities.</p>
      <p>Several committee members were highly critical of the spend with Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy putting pressure on the Department of Transport to explain why this is the case.</p>
      <p>PAC chairman Sean Fleming went through correspondence from the NTA in which the figures were contained and told his colleagues that at present there are 114 full-time staff and 150 outsourced agency work.</p>
      <p>“It is outrageous, this represents gross mismanagement of their financial allocation,” said Mr Fleming.</p>
      <blockquote>This is not specialised staff in the main, these are staff working day-to-day</blockquote>
      <p>In its documentation to the PAC, seen by the Irish Examiner, the NTA said there is a “significant cost premium attached to the use of outsourced placements” over NTA direct employees.</p>
      <p>“On average, the cost of an outsourced placement is more than double the salary cost of an equivalent permanent role within the Authority,” it confirmed.</p>
      <p>“In terms of the Authority’s resourcing mix, the overall aim of the NTA is to shift the 2019 ratio of ‘Direct Employees: Outsourced Placements’ (44% v 56%) to an approximate ratio of 68% direct employees and 32% outsourced placements,” it said.</p>
      <p>In response to a query from the Irish Examiner, the NTA referred to comments made by officials who appeared before committee in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Before the committee, the NTA said that the authority has been significantly under-resourced. Its staffing complement, in particular, has been well below what it requires to effectively undertake its statutory and non-statutory functions, it said.</p>
