      <p>FARMERS from across Ireland are planning a national tractor protest in Dublin later this month to campaign against continued discrimination of the farming community and rural Ireland as a whole.</p>
      <p>The tractor protest will be held on Tuesday, November 26, with the support of farmers from all farming organisations.</p>
      <p>The objective is to highlight the demise of farming and rural Ireland, said Aontú Dáil candidate for Mayo, Paul Lawless.</p>
      <p>A public information meeting will take place on Wednesday, November 20, at 8 p.m. in Knock Community Centre and all farmers are encouraged to attend.</p>
      <p>Said Mr. Lawless: “Farmers are being driven into poverty, debt and ultimately off the land. Family farms are the lifeblood and economic engines of small towns and villages across Mayo. The annihilation of the family farm will have catastrophic consequences for every parish in the county. It will send destructive tremors through all other agricultural businesses and sectors which are the fabric to many rural villages and towns.</p>
      <p>“We demand guarantees now that sustain family farming and the economic existence of people outside of Dublin. We are holding this protest so that the government can acknowledge the crisis that is facing so many of its citizens and actively plan to combat these issues.”</p>
