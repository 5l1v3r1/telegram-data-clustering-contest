      <p>The general election is underway, but when does voting take place, when will we know the results and when are the TV debates?</p>
      <p>We've got the answers right here:</p>
      <p><b>Wednesday 6 November</b> - dissolution of Parliament</p>
      <p>Dissolution is the official term for the end of a Parliament. That's when the election campaign officially began.</p>
      <p>Instructions, known as writs, were issued for elections to take place in the UK's 650 constituencies.</p>
      <p><b>Thursday 14 November</b> - deadline for the delivery of nomination papers</p>
      <p>Candidates who wanted to stand as MPs had to hand in nomination papers by 4pm.</p>
      <p><b>Tuesday 19 November</b> - the first TV election debate takes place, as Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson go head-to-head on ITV at 8pm.</p>
      <p><b>Tuesday 26 November</b> - voter registration deadline</p>
      <p>To vote in the 2019 General Election you must be registered to vote by midnight on 26 November.</p>
      <p><b>Tuesday 26 November</b> - deadline for postal vote applications</p>
      <p>The deadline to apply for a new postal or postal proxy vote, or to make any changes to existing postal votes, is 5pm.</p>
      <p><b>Thursday 28 November</b> - the Sky News election debate</p>
      <p><b>Friday 29 November</b> - the BBC's election debate</p>
      <p><b>Wednesday 4 December</b> - deadline for proxy vote applications</p>
      <p>Deadline for applying for a new proxy vote (except for emergency proxies) is 5pm.</p>
      <p><b>Thursday 12 December</b> - polling day</p>
      <p>Polling booths are open between 7am and 10pm.</p>
      <p>Counting of votes begin when the polls close.</p>
      <p><b>Thursday 12 December to Friday 13 December</b> - the result</p>
      <p>Counting starts at 10pm.</p>
      <p>Typically, the TV news shows organise an "exit poll", which is an opinion poll of people who have just voted. These exit polls tend to be pretty accurate, and they'll publish the findings just after 10pm. So we may have some idea who won the election quite early on. However, this is still just an opinion poll, not the actual result.</p>
      <p>Results from each constituency will be announced as the votes are counted. Local councils organise the count, and some traditionally do it faster than others (it might depend, for example, on how many people actually vote in each constituency). The first result might be announced around midnight, but there will probably be very few announcements until at least 1am.</p>
      <p>As time goes by, more and more results will be announced. It will probably be clear who has actually won by around 4am.</p>
      <p><b>Tuesday 17 December</b> - Parliament is expected to return for the election of the Speaker</p>
      <p>Election of the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>The Speaker is elected on the first day that the House meets after the General Election.</p>
