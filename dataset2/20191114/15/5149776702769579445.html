      <h1>Clear message issued over reported Nottingham Forest striker target</h1>
      <h2>The Reds have again been linked with Scottish forward Lawrence Shankland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:11:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Dundee United will not “entertain” any January bids for reported <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> target Lawrence Shankland.</p>
      <p>Head coach Robbie Neilson says he still expects the striker to be at the Scottish club come February.</p>
      <p>The Reds were linked with Shankland in the summer and it was reported earlier this month that they could rekindle their interest when the transfer window opens again.</p>
      <p>Celtic and Rangers are also said to be interested in the 24-year-old, who has been <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forests-january-transfer-target-3527535">in prolific form</a> so far this season with 19 goals in as many appearances for the Scottish Championship side.</p>
      <p>But Neilson is eager to hang on to the front man.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there will be any bids getting entertained in January, that is for sure,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50419638">he told the BBC.</a></p>

      <p>“The owner (Mark Ogren) was over last month and spoke about the importance of keeping Lawrence and making sure that we get ourselves out of this league.</p>
      <p>“Every player has his price but the value of going up would heavily outweigh that, not just financially but also the prestige and with the fans.</p>
      <p>“I expect him to be here at the start of February.”</p>
      <p>Shankland <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-target-turns-down-3053097">made the move to Dundee from Ayr</a> in the summer after a season which saw him bag 34 goals in 41 appearances.</p>
