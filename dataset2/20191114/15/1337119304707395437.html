      <h1>Walmart’s Black Friday ad has been unveiled — here are the deals you need to know about</h1>
      <h2>The Apple Watch Series 3 will start at $129, which is its lowest price ever</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:02:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner" target="_blank">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p>Walmart is the latest retailer to share its full Black Friday ad, and we’ve gone through it to find the very best tech deals. Some of the deals we’re seeing on the seventh-generation iPad and the PS4 Slim are similar to what will be on sale at other stores, like Target and Best Buy. But there is a surprising number of deals that seem to be exclusive to Walmart.</p>
      <p>We’ll point out which of the deals below you can take advantage of now, but most of them will begin online starting on Wednesday, November 27th, at 10PM ET, and in stores on Thanksgiving Day starting at 6PM ET. We’ll be updating this post as new deals come in and existing deals conclude.</p>
      <p>Walmart says that it will publish even more deals starting on November 22nd, so stay tuned for an update.</p>
      <h3>Computers and tablets</h3>
      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLaptop-Hexa-Core-Processor-RAM-i7-9750H-PCIe-Black-Intel-GeForce-Nvidia-6GB-Y545-RTX-16GB-Core-Lenovo-81Q6000QUS-Card-SSD-2060-Graphics-512GB-Storage%2F560161624">Lenovo’s Legion Y545 gaming laptop (15.6-inch display, Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 2060, 512GB PCIe SSD) is $1,099 right now</a> (usually $1,599). Any laptop with Nvidia’s ray tracing-enabled graphics card for less than $1,200 deserves your attention, so you should check this deal out while it’s available.</p>
      <p>Apple’s 10.5-inch iPad Pro from 2017 is heavily discounted at Walmart right now. <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-5-inch-iPad-Pro-Wi-Fi-512GB%2F55900709">The Wi-Fi version with 512GB of storage is $599</a>. It doesn’t have the same design as the newer iPad Pro or its USB-C port, but it has a few advantages over the current iPad Air. It has slightly more RAM, and notably, it has a ProMotion display with a variable refresh rate.</p>

      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-7th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB%2F216119597">Apple’s new seventh-generation iPad (Wi-Fi, 32GB) will be $249</a> (usually $329). We’re seeing this deal happening at other retailers, but it’s still hard not to emphasize how big of a deal this is. This model just released a few months ago, and while it has the same processor as the previous model, it has a bigger screen, an extra gigabyte of RAM, and a Smart Connector port, adding support for the Smart Keyboard.</p>
      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTouchscreen-HP-Full-Intel-4GB-UHD-128GB-White-Cloud-Chromebook-Core-620-15-Blue-Intel-i3-8130U-Graphics-Backlit-SDRAM-Ceramic-HD-Audio-15-de0517wm-15%2F836683677">HP’s Chromebook 15 (with a 15.6-inch display, 8th Gen Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM, 128GB of storage) will be $299</a> (usually $469). This model has a backlit keyboard, and for the money, looks better than most options at this price range.</p>
      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-Pavilion-Gaming-Desktop-Tower-Intel-Core-i5-9400F-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660Ti-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-690-0073w%2F902037635">HP’s Pavilion gaming desktop will be $579</a> on Black Friday, and for the money, it has some very decent specs. Inside, you’ll find a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics card, and 256GB of SSD storage. This package includes a keyboard and mouse with purchase.</p>

      <h3>Headphones</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fathcpid%3D604342441%26athpgid%3DathenaHomepage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3DBestInDeals%26athieid%3Dv1%26athstid%3DCS020%26athguid%3D466001f5-46cfa622-42efd1179a18a716%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue">second-generation Apple AirPods truly wireless headphones will be $129, down from their $144 sale price.</a> This is the best price that we’ve seen from a major retailer. It’s worth noting that this model doesn’t include a wireless charging case, so you’ll need to power it via its Lightning port. Still, that’s not bad at all for the latest AirPods.</p>
      <h3>Phone and smartwatches</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065">Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS, 38mm) will be $129</a>. We’ve only just started to see the third-generation Apple Watch drop below its $199 retail price, but this is by far the largest price drop yet. If you want the bigger 42mm model, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711">Walmart will have limited quantities of it for $159</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fpostpaid-annual-event-promotions%2F0%2F0%2F%3F_refineresult%3Dtrue%26_be_shelf_id%3D7851490%26search_sort%3D100%26facet%3Dshelf_id%3A7851490">Walmart will offer up to $700 in gift cards</a> when you activate certain iPhones and Samsung phones with an installment plan on AT&amp;T, Verizon, or Sprint, and trade in your old phone. As for how much you’ll get in return for your old phone, it varies on the model (you don’t need to trade in a phone to get the gift card), and how big of a gift card you get depends on the phone you’re interested in buying. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$450 gift card for the iPhone XS</li>
        <li>$400 gift card for the iPhone XS Max, or iPhone XR</li>
        <li>$300 gift card for the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max</li>
        <li>$450 gift card for the Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 Plus, or Note 10 Plus</li>
        <li>$300 gift card for the Galaxy S10E or Note 9</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFitbit-Versa-LITE-Edition-Smartwatch-Charcoal-Silver-Aluminum%2F497506373">The Fitbit Versa Lite smartwatch will be $99</a> (usually $159) during Black Friday at Walmart. If you don’t need a watch that has built-in Wi-Fi or the ability to track runs via GPS, this model will cost what Fitbit’s more limited trackers usually sell for.</p>
      <h3>Smart home</h3>
      <p>Several Google products are discounted right now at Walmart, including the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Charcoal%2F473535403">Google Nest Hub smart display for $99</a>. It usually costs $129, so this is a small but welcome discount. The <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Home-Smart-Speaker-Google-Assistant%2F54742302">Google Home smart speaker that regularly costs $100 is down to $79</a>.</p>

Best Buy and Target will also host this deal in case you strike out trying to find one at Walmart.</p>
      <p>If you’re hunting for an Xbox One at Walmart, you’ll find some good deals, though Target and Best Buy are offering these prices as well. <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fquery%3Dxbox%2520one%2520x%2520console">All Xbox One X consoles will be $349</a> (usually $499), and the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-One-S-All-Digital-Edition-V2-Console-Disc-free-Gaming-White-NJP-00050%2F339940120">Xbox One S 1TB All-Digital console (without a disc drive)</a> will be $149 (usually $249).
