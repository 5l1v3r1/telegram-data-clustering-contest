      <h1>Cartoon Network Comes to GOtv as the Pay-TV Company Adds Channels for the Holidays</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:36:26+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author">Kenn Abuya</a></address>
      <p>The holiday season is here, and this is the time of the year when parents get to interact with their school-going children whether it is convenient for them or otherwise, and we all know these young people need to be entertained. This is also the time of the year when businesses offer tons of promotions and discounts for their products and services, which include the likes of Black Friday deals.</p>
      <p>Multichoice-owned GOtv is adding new channels for its subscribers who may be using a variety of plans. These customers will have something new to watch over the festive period.</p>
      <p>The company is calling the offering ‘This is us Wakenya,’ which has since added four new channels to give viewers a refreshed entertainment experience on GOtv Max, Plus, and Value subscriptions.</p>
      <p><b>GOtv Max</b> has now been replenished with four new entertainment channels: TNT Africa, Discovery Channel ID, Da Vinci Kids and Cartoon Network</p>
      <p>Cartoon Network is hugely popular and will make a lot of people very happy, especially parents who want their kids engaged over this long holiday session.</p>
      <p><b>GOtv Plus</b> customers will also access Da Vinci Channel, Fox Channel, and Trace Music (No CN).</p>
      <p>Those on the <b>Value package</b> will not be left behind as they get to enjoy Realtime on Channel 12.</p>
      <p>“We are giving our GOtv customers the most value for money and even greater choice by making additional channels available to more packages and streamlining packages to deliver fresh entertainment. Our goal as GOtv is to deliver a television experience that caters to the whole family, and this comes just in time for the holidays. These changes will not only strengthen our DTT offering but also make great entertainment accessible to more even customers,” says Philip Wahome, MultiChoice Kenya Corporate Communications Manager.</p>
