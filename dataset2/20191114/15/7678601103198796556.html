      <h1>Medan suicide bomber pledged allegiance to new IS leader before attack: Think tank</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:53:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Ivany Atina Arbi</a></address>
      <p>A suicide bomber who blew himself up at Medan police headquarters in Medan, North Sumatra, on Wednesday, had pledged allegiance to a new Islamic State (IS) caliph (leader) before committing the attack, a global think tank has said.</p>
      <p>Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) revealed the information through its Twitter account <i>@TRACterrorism </i>on Wednesday afternoon, citing the news spread by IS supporters on their Telegram channel as its source.</p>
      <p>"Islamic State East Asia/Jamaah Ansharut Daulah supporters claim on Telegram that suicide bomber in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, pledged to new Caliph last night before the attack," the tweet said.</p>

      <p>The TRAC is a group providing researchers in terrorism studies, international relations and other relevant fields with data and analysis about ─ among other things ─ terror attacks in the world.</p>
      <p>Telegram, a highly encrypted messaging service, has been a favored medium and widely used by terrorist organizations to spread their propaganda and recruit members, terrorism analysts have said.</p>
      <p>The browser version of the messaging app was blocked by the government for its rampant use among local terrorists in July 2017. However, after Telegram reportedly agreed to create a system to filter out terrorism and radicalism-related content, the government restored full access to the app in August the same year.</p>
      <p>SITE Intelligence Group, a US-based company that tracks the online activity of jihadist organizations, has also said on its Twitter account <i>@siteintelgroup </i>that the Medan suicide bomber was identified as an “IS Telegram user”.</p>

      <p>The suicide bombing in Medan was the first that occurred in Indonesia following the death of former IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a raid by United States special forces in northwestern Syria in late October.</p>
      <p>In an audio tape posted online days after Baghdadi’s death, the IS group warned the US to “beware vengeance [against] their nation and their brethren of infidels and apostates”, Reuters has reported.</p>
      <p>The group also said in the tape that they had appointed Baghdadi’s successor, identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi.</p>
      <p>Following the attack at Medan Police headquarters, which occurred at around 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday and injured six people, authorities have identified the suicide bomber as Medan resident Rabbial Muslim Nasution, aka Dedek.</p>
      <p>The National Police said on Thursday that Rabbial had been exposed to terrorism through his wife, identified only as DA, who had "physically interacted" with a female terrorism convict currently detained in a penitentiary in Medan. </p>
      <p>The police had identified DA as a member of the IS-linked Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) ─ a homegrown terror group that was behind multiple terror attacks in Indonesia ─ who actively communicated with other cells in other parts of the country through social media.</p>
      <p>"The network seems to be planning an attack on Bali," National Police spokesperson Brig. Gen. Dedi Prasetyo said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>DA was arrested in her home in Medan by personnel of the police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad following the attack on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Densus 88 had also reportedly arrested four alleged terrorists with suspected links to JAD, three of whom were arrested in Banten and one in Central Java, after the attack.</p>
      <p>It is still unclear whether or not Rabbial was also a JAD member as the police said they were still investigating his affiliation.</p>
      <p>A number of security analysts have suspected that the Medan suicide bombing was executed by IS supporters as a form of revenge for the death of Baghdadi, who had declared himself as caliph of all Muslims.</p>
      <p>“We suspect that the terror attack was carried out by JAD or IS. The purpose was to avenge the death of IS leader [Baghdadi],” said Mohamad Nurzzaman, the head of the strategic study division at the country’s largest Islamic group Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) youth organization as quoted by NU Online<i>.</i></p>
