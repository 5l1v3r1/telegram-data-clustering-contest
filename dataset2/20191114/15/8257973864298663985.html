      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- <i>Real Housewives of Orange County</i> star Kelly Dodd is engaged to be married.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old television personality announced in an Instagram post Wednesday that she got engaged to her boyfriend, Fox News reporter Rick Leventhal.</p>
      <p>Dodd shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B406Fq-JeYA/">photo</a> of herself cuddled up to Leventhal in New York, where she will attend BravoCon this week. Her large pear-shaped diamond engagement ring can be seen on her left hand.</p>
      <p>"I can't believe I just got engaged!! @rickleventhal you are my <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Prince/?tps=1">Prince</a> and my dream come true!!! #love #engaged #myprince," Dodd captioned the post.</p>
      <p>Leventhal posted the same <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4044sWAGfP/">photo</a> on his own account.</p>
      <p>"Dreams do come true," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Dodd's <i>Real Housewives of Orange County</i> co-stars Emily Simpson and Braunwyn Windham-Burke and actor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jerry_O_Connell/?tps=1">Jerry O'Connell</a> were among those to congratulate the couple in the comments.</p>

      <p>"Omg!!!! I'm so happy for you! Can't wait to see you tomorrow and celebrate!!" Windham-Burke added.</p>
      <p>Dodd and Leventhal met through <i>Real Housewives of New York City</i> star Ramona Singer at a party in the Hamptons over the summer. The couple were first linked in August.</p>
      <p>"They've known one another for a short time but it's been a very deep connection," a source previously <a href="https://people.com/tv/rhoc-kelly-dodd-engaged-boyfriend-rick-leventhal/">told People</a>. "They are in love. It's special. They have great chemistry."</p>
