      <p>If <i>Sea of Thieves</i> isn't your bag, how about a sumptuous cel-shaded game from Rare that looks like a lost Miyazaki film? The Microsoft studio announced <i>Everwild </i>today during the XO19 Inside Xbox presentation, and while there aren't many details to run with, it certainly looks intriguing. The trailer shows us a gorgeous world filled with fantasy creatures and human-like characters tentatively co-existing, while something nefarious brews in darkness. Rare says it's an open-world title that it'll be developing alongside <i>Sea of Thieves, </i>so don't expect it to arrive anytime soon.</p>
