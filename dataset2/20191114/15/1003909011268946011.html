      <h1>Williams: What's so threatening about my freedom of conscience bill?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:00:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>“Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: freedom of conscience and religion.”</p>
      <p>If you listen to some recent commentary from some pundits and politicians, you’d think that’s a statement from a preacher or radical political activist.</p>
      <p>But, no, it’s Section 2(a) of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms — part of Canada’s Constitution added under Pierre Trudeau. Conscience rights are not offensive or part of a malicious agenda. Freedom of conscience is the first “fundamental freedom” listed in the Charter for a very good reason — all other freedoms depend upon it.</p>
      <p>My private member’s Bill 207, the Conscience Rights Protection Act, merely seeks to affirm constitutional rights — the highest law of the land — in Alberta law.</p>
      <p>Bill 207 does not restrict access to health-care services. Provision of services will continue on exactly as before. But my bill does provide clarity to health-care professionals in an evolving legal environment.</p>

      <p>The Supreme Court’s 2015 Charter decision, which legalized euthanasia, created new predicaments for health-care providers. A subsequent ruling from the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that doctors must provide an “effective referral” to a professional who is willing to participate in such an act should they be unwilling to do so personally.</p>
      <p>While such a requirement might seem innocuous at first glance, a doctor who objects to euthanasia on deeply held moral grounds may view participating in an effective referral akin to being an accomplice in the act.</p>
      <p>Should that doctor be sanctioned or fired for exercising his or her conscience rights? I would say no. Albertans should not have to surrender their constitutional rights in order to practice their chosen profession — especially not when there are viable alternatives to forcing providers to act against their conscience.</p>
      <p>Some wrongly argue that declining to refer a patient to a specific doctor or service is the same as restricting access to health care. But public reaction to my bill has made it clear that there are many doctors willing to provide services that a minority of doctors might find is against their beliefs. No single doctor has a monopoly on providing a service to patients.</p>
      <p>What’s more, this attack ignores the multitude of access points Albertans have in a modern society. We no longer live in an era where Albertans are isolated in small towns with limited connectivity and freedom of movement.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.cpsa.ca/standardspractice/medical-assistance-dying/?highlight=medical%20assistance%20in%20dying">College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta</a> currently requires doctors with moral objections to “offer the patient timely access to another physician or resource that will provide information about all available medical options.”</p>
      <p>The college has stated that Bill 207 does nothing to change the status quo: “(The college) believes the bill as drafted is broadly consistent with this standard and meets both the needs of physicians and Albertans.”</p>
      <p>Alberta Health Services’ excellent Healthlink 811 24/7 phone line currently provides medical referrals for all Albertans, as well as a vast amount of information.</p>
      <p>And while some self-proclaimed “experts” have argued that Bill 207 is an attack on Albertans’ rights, the opposite is true.</p>
      <p>A legal opinion of Bill 207 from a reputable law firm was in turn provided to retired Supreme Court Justice John C. Major, one of Canada’s pre-eminent and most well-respected legal minds.</p>
      <p>Major’s assessment is clear: “(The legal opinion’s) conclusion which speaks for itself is that Bill 207 is valid legislation that embraces the Charter rather than breaches it. An opinion that I agree with.”</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that some political opponents and activists will continue to try to mar Bill 207 over the coming weeks and months. Nevertheless, I hope that we can all agree that fundamental freedoms should be valued and respected — and that includes conscience rights.</p>
      <p>We can and should continue to provide a balance and encourage thoughtful accommodations that both provide Albertans with access to health care while not needlessly impinging on the constitutional rights of their fellow Albertans.</p>
