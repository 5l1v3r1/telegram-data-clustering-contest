      <p>Quadra Island resident Sarah Boyes is hoping crews will soon be able to refloat the massive barge that ran aground Saturday evening north of the community of Cape Mudge.</p>
      <p>From the kitchen window of the waterfront home where she is housesitting, Boyes can see the Nana Provider, still tethered to its tugboat, with a Canadian Coast Guard vessel bobbing in the background.</p>
      <p>“It could be sitting there for a while, but I really hope they can get it out,” said Boyes.</p>
      <p>“The saddest moment was watching two sea lions mournfully calling for 25 minutes in front of it at low tide the other day. They couldn’t get around it … The barge is right in their favourite place to hunt and play. It’s right through their regular path and through their hunting grounds.”</p>
      <p>Transport Canada said in a statement Thursday that an attempt to refloat the barge will not take place before the weekend. Transport Canada is working with the owner and a salvage contractor to ensure any plan to refloat the Nana Provider takes into account water depths, the environment and tidal currents in Discovery Passage.</p>
      <p>The government body is investigating how the barge managed to run aground on rocks on the southwest coast of the island.</p>
      <p>Nana Provider was being pulled by a tugboat, heading to Alaska, when it hit rocks and damaged its hull. The six people on the tugboat were uninjured and the tug was not damaged.</p>
      <p>There are three loaded rail cars on board the barge — one contains compressed carbon dioxide, while the other two contain a corrosion inhibitor. All other rail cars and containers are empty, as is the hull.</p>
      <p>The coast guard has said the situation is stable and there is little risk of pollution.</p>
      <p>Boyes said the grounding “sounded horrendous.”</p>
      <p>“It sounded like the whole bottom was being ripped open as it was coming in on the rocks. It was pretty damn scary. And then to have the crew yelling: ‘Whoa. Stop. Help.’ I’m sure they’ve never yelled so loud in their lives.”</p>
      <p>Prior to the noise, Boyes said, she had looked out at the water because the house was vibrating more than normal, and noticed that the tug was really close to shore at low tide.</p>
      <p>“All I remember seeing in the darkness is this huge tug all lit up. The tugs do come close at high tide to avoid the ebbs, but I’ve never seen one this close. It looked low, but it was dark and I was distracted. I turned away, thinking they must know what they’re doing, and within 10 seconds, I heard the barge hitting and I watched it coming right at me.”</p>
      <p>The tug was to her right. On her left was the massive dark barge scraping along the rocks.</p>
      <p>“I was caught right in the middle hearing the sounds of both vehicles,” Boyes said.</p>
      <p>Catherine Smith lives in the house closest to the stranded barge, about 200 feet off her deck. She said she has watched tugs pulling barges up and down the channel for 40 years and never seen anything like this incident.</p>
      <p>She said she jumps every time the barge makes noise. “At low tide, the whole barge tilts to the port side, which faces Campbell River. It groans and it creaks and it bangs. So this happens every time there’s a low tide, whether it’s now or in the middle of the night.”</p>
      <p>Smith said crews are working from 8 a.m. until it gets dark, and she has seen divers come and go and compressors being dropped off, but wants more information on what’s going on.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, she phoned and wrote to the owner, Lynden Incorporated, asking for more information, but she hasn’t heard back.</p>
      <p>If the barge had been full of chemicals, it would have been a dire emergency, said Smith, who hopes the area is monitored after the barge is removed.</p>
      <p>“It’s in a rather sensitive area with octopi and all kinds of sea life and a rock for the seals and the sea lions. And the whales would come right past.</p>
      <p>“I think some serious thought has to be given to how they go through, because the tug was 1,000 feet from the barge. They couldn’t have had eyes on the barge, because they were around the corner. It’s not a straight sightline.”</p>
      <p>Like Boyes, Smith has heard sea lions barking at the barge.</p>
      <p>“They were definitely unhappy with this state of affairs.”</p>
