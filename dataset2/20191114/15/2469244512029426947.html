      <p>A new cycle scheme in Exeter is <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/special-features/exeters-electric-bike-hire-service-3310888">being introduced</a> in a bid to make it easier, healthier and greener to get around the city.</p>
      <p>Co Bikes has electric bikes distributed at various <a href="https://www.co-bikes.co.uk/locations/">key points</a> around Exeter.</p>
      <p>People can hire them and use them to get around before dropping them off at different spots in the city.</p>
      <p>The bikes are located at Exeter Central Station, St Davids Station, the Civic Centre, Digby &amp; Sowton Station, County Hall, St Luke's Campus and The Forum on the University of Exeter main campus.</p>

      <p>A live map on the Co Bikes website reveals how many bikes are available at each location.</p>
      <p>To use each bike, customers download an app to their phone. Registration is free, although a £10 deposit is taken to activate it which is then redeemed against each trip.</p>
      <p>Bikes are hired at £1 every 20 minutes, or £24 for anything between eight and 24 hours.</p>
      <p>They do not have to be returned at the same dock where they were hired, meaning you could hire one at St Davids then cycle to County Hall and return in there, for example.</p>

      <p>Co Bikes are powered by nextbike, who operate shared bike schemes in 200 cities around the world.</p>

        <b>My experience of using one of Co Bikes' electric bikes for the day:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having never used Co Bikes or even ridden an electric bike before, I was a little sceptical of how I would find the experience.</p>
      <p>I turned up at St Davids and, within five minutes, was cycling for my first experience of an electric bike.</p>
      <p>Downloading the app and registering is genuinely easy. I'm not desperately tech savvy, but within five minutes I had the app on my phone after following the instructions at the dock and I was cleared to take one of the bikes.</p>
      <p>And, even for an experienced cyclist like myself, I was genuinely surprised at how quickly I could get around.</p>
      <p>St David's Hill is rarely fun, even on my road bike, but this e-bike chewed through it with no hassle at all - and I wasn't a sweaty mess by the end of it.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>They are also at St Davids Station</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The bikes have three gears and are surprisingly satisfying as soon as you hear them whir into action and propel you along. Having said that, they are nice and stable too, so you really don't have to be Sir Bradley Wiggins to get the hang of them.</p>
      <p>They have a couple of nifty features as well, including a basket at the front where you can shove your bags.</p>
      <p>There is also an in-built lock on the bikes  so you don't have to worry about security if you are popping into shops or leaving it unattended for a while.</p>
      <p>I also had a useful experience when I came to return mine at Central Station.</p>
      <p>All of the docks were full, so again I followed the instructions by locking the bike and leaving it there before ringing nextbike customer service to confirm my session had come to an end.</p>

        <figcaption>The bikes are located conveniently around the city</figcaption>

      <p>Criticisms? Very few, to be honest.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the only one I could think of was that they are so easy to get around on, it's easy to forget that they weigh a little more than a normal bike so pulling one up onto the curb or through a doorway requires a little more effort - but that really is splitting hairs.</p>
      <p>I've also noticed more and more of the bikes around town, so it's nice to see they are catching on.</p>
      <p>Exeter has some pretty ambitious green targets to hit in the coming years and we all know how bad the traffic can be, so hopefully something like this can at least make a bit of a difference.</p>
