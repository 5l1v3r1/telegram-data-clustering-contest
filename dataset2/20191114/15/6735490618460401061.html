      <p>“I love that we were creating this American mythology about Camp Redwood that had its own inner life. I knew going into the season that I was very, very interested in working with John Carroll Lynch, who we worked with before, he was Twisty,” he said. “I wanted to make a leading part or bigger part for him. I knew that I wanted Finn [Wittrock] to be his son, and I knew that I wanted a happy ending, ironically.”</p>
      <p>Murphy continued, “I wanted something that was – this whole season was about two things: Younger and happy ending. So we were writing to those two things all along. John says that when I pitch American Horror Story to him, I don’t know the ending. But I knew that was where we wanted to go to, that very ending.”</p>

      <p>As Murphy explained, the ending turned out to be quite different from other “AHS” finales.</p>
      <p>“It’s the only ‘American Horror Story’ ending that has made me cry,” he admitted. “Something about that father-son thing always kills me. I’m very nostalgic about Lily Rabe, seeing her in that part. I was really close to her mom, Jill Clayburgh, which is how Lily was introduced into my life. I’m also very close to Finn, and I always wanted to write a beefy, big part for John Carroll Lynch. It was a murderer’s row of talent that I was really close with and loved. Yeah, I loved it.”</p>
