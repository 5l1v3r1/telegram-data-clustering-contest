      <p>Arsenal have reportedly sent scouts to watch Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu in international action.</p>
      <p>Soyuncu has been a revelation for the Foxes this season since they sold Harry Maguire to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> for a world record fee on the eve of the season.</p>
      <p>He will be in action for Turkey against Iceland on Thursday and Turkish newspaper <a href="https://www.star.com.tr/spor/">Star</a> claim Gunners scouts will be in attendance to watch him in action.</p>
      <p>They are also believed to be keeping an eye on Soyuncu's team-mate Merih Demiral, with Manchester United scouts believed to be joining them to watch the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> youngster in action.</p>

      <p>He eventually opted to join <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in August 2018 on a five-year deal, playing a bit-part role last season with Maguire established as their first choice.</p>
