      <p>A significant number of you want nothing to do with snow right now, but it's time to bundle up and watch a new trailer for <i>Wasteland 3</i>, the latest in a line of nuked-out role-playing games from inXile.</p>

      <p><i>Wasteland 3</i> is trading out Arizona's blazing heat for a literal nuclear winter in Colorado, and you'll be able to run wild with a six-person Ranger squad in co-op. That'll keep the spider-mechs at bay.</p>
      <p>During today's X019 stream, inXile studio head Brian Fargo had a lot of good things to say about Microsoft and its post-acquisition impact on <i>Wasteland 3</i> (which is still coming to PC, Xbox One, and PS4). Even as someone who hasn't managed to get this series off their to-do list yet, I'm interested.</p>
      <p>"You don't need to have played the first two <i>Wasteland </i>games," said Fargo. "In fact, <i>Wasteland 3 </i>is completely standalone." He also dropped this tidbit: the game has "half a million words of dialogue."</p>
      <p>If you're longing for another tactical RPG, go ahead and set the date: May 19, 2020.</p>
