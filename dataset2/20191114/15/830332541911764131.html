      <h2>Movie's end has people buzzing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:21:37+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Respers France, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - "Last Christmas" is based on the famous Wham! holiday song, but the film has a decided twist that has audiences buzzing.</p>
      <p>Director Paul Feig and producer David Livingstone <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/last-christmas-story-behind-george-michael-movie-twist-explained-1254657">talked to The Hollywood Reporter</a> about that and more regarding <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/entertainment/last-christmas-review/index.html">the movie</a> which stars Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding.</p>
      <p>Clarke plays Kate, a woman who is having a bit of a rough time and who is a heart transplant patient. She meets Golding's character Tom, who takes her on a tour of the city and implores her to "Look up" as a way of getting away from distractions and really being present in life.</p>
      <p>Livingstone told THR he came up with the idea for the film when faced with the challenge of introducing something new into the already well-worn trope of holiday films.</p>
      <p>"I thought the biggest thing I can think of is [the song] 'Last Christmas,'" he said. "That's the one thing that happens every Christmas, particularly in the UK. [George Michael's] our Stevie Wonder, really, where you just go, 'Oh, my god, Christmas has arrived. It's 'Last Christmas.'"</p>
      <p>George Michael was one half of the duo Wham! and sings the song "Last Christmas" which he also wrote.</p>
      <p>Livingstone said he had approached Michael about working together on the project and the singer wanted Emma Thompson to write the script.</p>
      <p>It all was put on hold, Livingstone said, after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/europe/george-michael-death-natural-causes-coroner/index.html">Michael's death</a> in 2016 and Thompson's busy schedule. But it all came together after Livingstone and Thompson ran into each other at an awards ceremony.</p>
      <p>"We were both backstage and I said, 'We should really do something, Emma. And she said, 'Let's do Last Christmas. Let's make it happen,'" he said. "So we did. She wrote the beautiful script."</p>
      <p>Audiences learn at the end that Golding's Tom actually died and was the heart donor who saved Clarke's Kate.</p>
      <p>It's a literal interpretation of the song's line "Last Christmas, I gave you my heart."</p>
      <p>Director Paul Feig told THR the ending helped hook him.</p>
      <p>"I like when movies surprise you and things are unexpected but in very emotional ways -- something that affects you so deeply and connects you even more to the characters and makes their journey become even more clear," he said.</p>
      <p>Feig also <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/paul-feig-dissects-the-twist-at-the-heart-of-last-christmas.html">talked to Vulture </a>about wanting to go beyond just a typical "girl meets boy" film.</p>
      <p>"None of us ever -- I know I definitely didn't want to, and Emma [Thompson] didn't want to, and Emilia didn't either -- want to make a movie about, you know, a woman being saved by a man," he said.</p>
