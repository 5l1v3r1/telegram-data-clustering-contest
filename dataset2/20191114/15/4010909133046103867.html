Here's what you need to know.</p>
      <p>Starting with Friends, the reunion will be streaming on HBO Max with all the original cast members - Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc - as well as the original show creators, David Crane and Marta Kauffman.
