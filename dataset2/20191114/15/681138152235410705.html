        <b>A 21-year-old man has been banned from attending any football match in the UK after he fought with police before a game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jon Harknett from Spruce Avenue, Colchester was arrested on March 30, the day of the U's game against Cambridge United, after getting involved in a fight.</p>
      <p>Harknett ran towards a developing fight between opposing fans in Newmarket Road, Cambridge, shortly after 2pm, as fans headed towards Abbey Stadium.</p>
      <p>He was stopped by an officer but managed to struggle free and threw a punch towards him before being arrested on suspicion of affray.</p>
      <p>Harknett was charged with using threatening words or behaviour and initially denied the offence.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on November 13 where he was given a football banning order and fined Â£1500.</p>
      <p>Harknett cannot attend any UK football match, specifically home and away games for Colchester United.</p>
      <p>He will also have to surrender his passport when England play abroad and during Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Mark Wood, football officer from Cambridgeshire Police said: "This type of anti-social behaviour tarnishes the reputation of the 99 per cent of supporters who just want to turn up and watch the match.</p>
      <p>"There is no place for this behaviour anywhere and particularly not at football matches, which are family environments."</p>
