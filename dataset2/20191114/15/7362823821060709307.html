      <h1>Conway calls out House Dems for pushing hearsay evidence: 'Bunch of gossip girls'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:12:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Givas</a></address>
      <p>House <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrats</a> are relying on hearsay evidence to try to remove <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> and have turned the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> into an episode of "Gossip Girl," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-nikki-haley-donald-trump-americas-newsroom">Kellyanne Conway</a> said Thursday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends">Fox &amp; Friends</a>."</p>
      <p>"The president is being treated unfairly," she said. "I think those 31 Democrats who won in 2018 in districts Trump and [Mike] Pence carried in 2016 are probably watching this most closely. Much more closely than the country is.</p>
      <p>"You tune in, you're either sound asleep, or you can't follow -- he said/she said, he said, he said. It's a bunch of gossip girls. It's not a legitimate inquiry," she continued.</p>
      <p>Conway, the White House counselor, also said congressional Democrats have no case against Trump and accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a>, D-Calif., of running a "kangaroo court."</p>

      <p>"We learned that the Democrats have really no case against the president," she said earlier in the segment. "[If] this was a real court of law and not Adam Schiff’s kangaroo court, objections would have been flying from any reasonable attorney."</p>
      <p>"I think that's why the president and people like Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham">Lindsey Graham</a>, chair of the Judiciary Committee, have said, 'We want to know what the whistleblower said in the first place because we need to confront our accuser,'" Conway continued.</p>
      <p>"If you were in a civil suit or... a criminal suit you would be able to confront your accuser... and challenge evidence and present witnesses and challenge witnesses."</p>
      <p>She also said Democrats are still holding onto Robert Mueller's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation">Russia investigation</a> and will stop at nothing to see Trump removed from power.</p>

      <p>"This entire inquiry is just a continuation of their Russian investigation that went nowhere," Conway said, claiming Mueller was "stumbling and bumbling" through his congressional testimony earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"He was the original star witness of the summer that was supposed to undo the president... They can’t get [Trump] at the ballot box. They're trying to undo a democratically elected president from three years ago and they’re trying to interfere. Yes, I said it, interfere, in the next election."</p>
