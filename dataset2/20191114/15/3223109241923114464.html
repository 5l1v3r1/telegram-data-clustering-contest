      <h1>Google Maps Audibly Translates Place Names, So You Don’t Have To</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:38:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Navigating a foreign country where you don’t speak or read the language can be… interesting.</p>
      <p>So <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/google-maps-out-thanksgiving-1810292/">Google Maps</a> is adding a new translation feature that lets your phone do the speaking.</p>
      <p>Gone are the days of anxiously trying to talk to a taxi driver in Spanglish or accidentally offending a local when asking for directions in broken Italian.</p>
      <p>Starting this month, world travelers can tap the new speaker button next to a place name or address and Google Maps will say it out loud.</p>
      <p>Need to know more about your destination? Want to thank the Good Samaritan? Hoping to score with a cute passerby? Click “Get more translations” to open the Google Translate app (if you have it installed).</p>
      <p>The text-to-speech technology automatically detects what <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/google-translate-adds-more-languages-to-wikipedia-article-editing-1769371/">language</a> your phone is using, to determine which places you might need help translating.</p>
      <p>If your phone is set to English, for instance, and you’re looking at a place of interest in Tokyo, the speaker icon will appear next to the location’s name and address.</p>
      <p>“So you can get a real-time translation,” Google Maps Product Manager Laszlo de Brissac wrote in <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/speak-easy-while-traveling">a blog announcement</a>.</p>
      <p>Don’t be too offended if the <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/google-maps-adds-voice-guidance-for-visually-impaired-1807060/">app</a> tries to help steer you through Paris, when you took four years of high-school French. There does not appear to be a way to turn off certain languages that users may already know.</p>
      <p>In that case, just ignore the speaker icon and <i>tu te fais</i>.</p>
      <p>The new feature is rolling out this month to Android and iOS users, with support for 50 languages (including Japanese) and more on the way.</p>
