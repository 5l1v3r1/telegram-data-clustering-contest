      <h2>Atletico Madrid striker Costa is being tested</h2>

      <p>Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa has taken some tests after suffering a hernia injury in recent days. The forward may be out until April even if he does not take surgery on the injury.</p>
      <p>The player could have conservative treatment if the injury is small, but if it affects the nerve he will need to be operated on.</p>
      <p>The forward has played 15 games this season, although only has two goals and two assists. Even if he is back in April it would put at great risk his chances of playing for Spain in the 2020 European Championships.</p>
