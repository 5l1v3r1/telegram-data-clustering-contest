      <p>Xbox sure knows how to slash prices for big holiday promos, and Black Friday 2019 is no exception. Microsoft is taking $150 off the top for Xbox One X console bundles and $100 off Xbox One S systems.</p>
      <p>From November 24 to December 2, the <b>console deals</b> are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one-x?xr=shellnav">Xbox One X bundles</a> for $349.99 ($150 off)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one-s?xr=shellnav">Xbox One S bundles</a> for $199.99 ($100 off)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/consoles/xbox-one-s/all-digital-edition">Xbox One S All-Digital Edition bundles</a> for $149.99 ($100 off)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a lot of different bundles with a lot of different games <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/consoles">floating around</a>, so it's up to you – the Black Friday discounts are across the board. I'd just be wary of the All-Digital Edition if you like discs.</p>
      <p><b>Certain Xbox One controllers</b> – like the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/gears-5-kait-diaz">Kait Diaz Gears 5 Limited Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/sport-blue-special-edition">Sport Blue Special Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/night-ops-camo-special-edition">Night Ops Camo Special Edition</a> – will be $20 off from November 24 to December 2. So $50 instead of $70, in most cases. If you think those gamepad designs are ugly (you said it, not me!), you can also save $10 on your own custom-detailed <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/?rtc=1">Xbox Design Lab</a> controller during that Black Friday window.</p>
      <p>The best overall deal, however, is <b>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</b>. Beginning November 14, you can get three months of the service for $1. That's full access to some great games – including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-outer-worlds-569391.phtml"><i>The Outer Worlds</i></a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-gears-5-566490.phtml"><i>Gears 5</i></a>, and <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-subnautica-483678.phtml">Subnautica</a> </i>– for a dollar. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Game Pass Ultimate</a> includes Xbox Live Gold, too.</p>
      <p>Or, if you'd rather not be tied to a subscription, you can save on select Xbox Game Studios titles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Gears 5 </i>(33% off)</li>
        <li><i>Forza Horizon 4 </i>(50% off)</li>
        <li><i>Sea of Thieves: Anniversary Edition </i>(50% off)</li>
        <li><i>State of Decay 2 </i>(50% off)</li>
        <li><i>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice </i>(50% off)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They really, <i>really</i> want everyone to sub to Game Pass. Imagine how overwhelmed you'd be if you woke from a coma and just now considered getting an Xbox One, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../the-next-generation-of-xbox-begins-holiday-2020-with-halo-as-a-launch-title-556610.phtml">a year before Scarlett is due</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Disclosure-bot:</b> Just in case the editor neglected to mention it, we have zero control when deals start and end. Deals can sometimes be gone within minutes (please don't shoot the messenger). Trying deal links even hours after this article's time stamp may lead to self-punching, so maybe bookmark our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/index-huge.phtml?t=deals">video game deals</a> if you're on the hunt. Also, it goes without saying, but some shopping links do directly support the author. If you've spotted any inaccuracy please let us know asap.</p>
