      <p>ATLANTA, Ga. â€“ There were 2,172 cases of lung injury linked to vaping as of November 13, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">said on Thursday</a> .</p>
      <p>That's an increase from last week, when there were 2,051 cases of vaping-related lung injuries.</p>
      <p>"Fortunately, the new cases appear to be trending downward nationally, although some states remain hard-hit," Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, testified Wednesday to the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.</p>
      <p>The vaping injuries have been reported in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Alaska remains the one state without any vaping-related injuries reported to the CDC.</p>
      <p>The agency has also confirmed 42 confirmed deaths in 24 states and the District of Columbia, ranging from 17 to 75 years old with a median age of 52. Other deaths are still under investigation.</p>
      <p>But the ages of those impacted by lung injury tend to be younger, with a median age of 24 and nearly 4 in 5 patients under 35. About 7 in 10 are male.</p>
      <p>The CDC says it has yet to identify the official cause or causes of the outbreak, but the investigation has increasingly focused on products containing THC.</p>
      <p>Last week, the agency reported the first "chemical of concern" it detected in patient samples: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/health/vaping-injury-vitamin-e-thc-bn/index.html">vitamin E acetate</a> , an additive sometimes used in these products because it resembles THC oil and may be used as a thickening ingredient.</p>
      <p>The chemical is generally considered harmless in foods, supplements and lotions -- but inhaling it "may interfere with normal lung functioning," according to the CDC.</p>
      <p>However, that doesn't mean the case is closed. The CDC is continuing to evaluate a wide range of chemicals, according to Schuchat.</p>
      <p>"This does not rule out other possible ingredients," Schuchat told reporters last week. "There may be more than one cause."</p>
