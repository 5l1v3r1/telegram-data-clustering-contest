      <p>Turkey’s Interior Ministry did not provide any further details Thursday or identify the suspects.</p>
      <p>Turkey is engaged in a push to deport foreign IS members who are held in its prisons or in Syria, since it invaded parts of northeast Syria to drive away from a border area Syrian Kurdish fighters it considers to be terrorists.</p>
