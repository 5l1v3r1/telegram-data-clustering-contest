        <b>The National University is set to rename five of its affiliated colleges that were named after anti-liberation figures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The university has already changed the name of one of the colleges -- Rangamati's Rabeta Model College -- to Langdu Model College.</p>
      <p>The authority is working to finalise the names of the others, it said on Thursday. These are: Habiganj's Syed Sayeeduddin College to be renamed Moulana Asad Ali Degree College; Cox's Bazar's Eidgah Farid Ahmed College to be renamed Eidgah Rashid Ahmed College; Tangail's Basail Emdad Hamida College to be renamed Basail Degree College; and Gaibandha's Dharmapur Abdul Jabbar College to be renamed Dharmapur Degree College.</p>
      <p>It comes a year after the National University authority decided to identify and rename colleges named after people who opposed the Liberation War of Bangladesh.</p>
