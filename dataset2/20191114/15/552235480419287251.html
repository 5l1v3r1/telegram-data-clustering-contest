      <h1>Livingston could look to add to squad as injury list piles up</h1>
      <h2>Boss Gary Holt joked that he may have to put his boots on as the Lions deal with a lengthy injury list.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:06:21+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Carson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/callum-carson/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Holt joked that he might have to come out of retirement to help ease his side’s injury woes.</p>
      <p>Skipper Alan Lithgow is set to miss several weeks following surgery to remove his appendix, and joins Nicky Devlin and Cece Pepe on the injury list.</p>
      <p>Lithgow (31) missed the defeat to Rangers and could struggle to feature again before the winter break, while Frenchman Pepe picked up a calf injury in a recent reserves game.</p>
      <p>Devlin’s season could be in doubt after he damaged knee ligaments in last month’s draw with Hearts.</p>
      <p>Chris Erskine and Lee Miller have also missed time recently, while Lyndon Dykes and Scott Pittman have only just returned to first team action.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Holt said: “Bringing someone in is something we’re looking at, but are they going to be up to speed with us having so many games in quick succession before the winter break?</p>
      <p>“We have to have a look at what’s out there because we’re right down to the bare bones just now. I might even have to get my boots back on.</p>
      <p>“Alan is going to be a big miss and I’m not sure how long he’ll be out for, but that’s part of football and it’s something we have to deal with.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Our injuries are affecting us. Even with Pitts and Lyndon, they’re still playing catch up on the fitness side of things so the break is ideal.”</p>
