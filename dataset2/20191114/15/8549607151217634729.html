        <b><a href="https://crypto.com/en/index.html">Crypto.com</a>, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency service provider that offers users lending services, crypto payments through Visa debit card services and more, has announced the launch of its cryptocurrency exchange. The firm says the new crypto trading venue will be initially available to only its retail and institutional customers via its mobile app, trading API and web interface, according to a <i>Finance Magnates</i> report on November 14, 2019.</b>

      <h3>Crypto.Com Exchange Now Live</h3>
      <p>In a bid to promote unending customer loyalty by offering them a complete suite of highly functional cryptocurrency-linked financial products and services, Crypto.com has rolled out its exchange.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-com-launches-cryptocurrency-exchange-supporting-9-assets/">sources</a> close to the matter, the new Crypto.com exchange will initially support a handful of established cryptos, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, litecoin (LTC), EOS, lumens (XLM) tether (USDT), MCO, and its native CRO altcoin.</p>
      <p>Crypto.com claims to have up to one million users at the moment and the new exchange will only be available to these existing users for now.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the launch of the exchange, Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com reiterated that the exchange has always been the missing link in Crypto.com’s product offerings and it is proud to bridge that gap.</p>
      <p>In his words:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>For Crypto.com, it’s about closing the loop. We’ve got a lot of customers who use us for buying and storing crypto and earning interest, but whenever they need to trade in a professional environment, they move to other platforms.</b>”</blockquote>
      <h4>Security is Key </h4>
      <p>At a time when crypto exchange hacks and heists are becoming quite synonymous with the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Crypto.com has made it clear that it takes the security of its users’ funds very seriously. </p>
      <p>The firm claims to have achieved the <a href="https://www.certificationeurope.com/certification/iso-2700-information-security/">ISO Certification 27001:2013</a> – the current standard that proves a firm’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) is watertight, PCI DSS Level 1 Certification, and CCSS Level 3 Compliance.</p>
      <p>What’s more, Crypto.com says it has also inked a deal with Ledger Vault, the institutional-grade crypto custodial service of Ledger, to enable it to tap the platform’s robust services</p>
      <p>In related news, earlier in October 2019, <i>BTCManager</i> <a href="https://btcmanager.com/crypto-com-services-49-american-states/">informed</a> that Crypto.com had extended its products and services to 49 U.S. jurisdictions, as part of plans to achieve its primary objective of making it easier for everyone to buy, hold and spend cryptos.</p>
