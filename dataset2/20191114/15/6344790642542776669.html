      <h1>New Details on Marvel's WANDAVISION Series and Its Sitcom Themes</h1>

      <p>I’ve heard some interesting news regarding what Marvel’s <b><i>WandaVision</i></b> will entail from a couple of different sources. While the studio hasn’t confirmed any of this, there has been other info leaked that ties into what I’ve heard.</p>
      <p>Before I go on, <b>Elizabeth Olsen</b> explained that the series is “a mash-up between American sitcoms throughout the decades and Marvel films with these characters.”<b> Paul Bettany </b>added, “That’s where it starts, and then it sort of snowballs into an epic Marvel movie that you’ve grown to know or love.”</p>
      <p>While the following is just rumors at the moment, if you want to play it safe and not have anything spoiled for you, here’s a spoiler alert:</p>

      <p>According to entertainment scooper <a href="https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/exclusive-details-on-marvel-studios-wandavision/">Charles Murphy</a>, parts of the series might actually be filmed in front of a live studio audience. It’s explained that the series will pay homage to several multi-camera comedies throughout the years.</p>
      <p>As we’ve seen in early<a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/fantastic-recreation-of-the-wandavision-teaser-trailer-that-marvel-screened-at-d23"> promos</a> that have been <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/poster-art-revealed-for-marvels-black-widow-film-and-wandavision-series">shared</a>, the series will start off with a <i>Leave It To Beaver</i> themed episode. From what I’ve learned, the series will also feature sitcoms from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980, 1990s, and the 2000s.</p>
      <p>I’ve heard that one will be a <i>Bewitched</i> themed episode and that there will even be a <i>Modern Family</i> themed episode. That should give you an example of what to expect from the series. It will be cool to see what other sitcoms the series pays tribute to as the story plays out.</p>
      <p>When previously talking about the show, director <b>Matt Shakman</b> (<i>Game of Thrones, The Boys</i>) told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibW1UKctqqM">Extra Butter</a>, “We can’t say much. It’s all pretty much on lockdown at this moment, but all we can say really is it’s a blend of classic sitcom and huge, epic Marvel action.”</p>
      <p>I’m excited to see how this series all comes together! The series will explore why Wanda Maximoff is known as Scarlet Witch, and it will lead into the big MCU film <i>Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness</i>. The series is said to see Scarlet Witch’s descent into madness and it’s rumored that she might be the main villain in the <i>Doctor Strange</i> sequel, which would certainly be fascinating.</p>
      <p>What other classic sitcoms would you like to see incorporated in WandaVision?</p>
      <p>The concept for the series was conceived by <b>Kevin Feige</b>, and <i>WandaVision</i> debuts on Disney+ in Spring 2021.</p>
