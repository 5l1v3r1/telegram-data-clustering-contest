      <h1>Teenage protesters released from detention in Papua</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:30:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Benny Mawel</a></address>
      <p>Four students detained by police in antiracism protests that turned violent in Wamena and Timika, Papua, in September have been released because they are under the age of 18. </p>
      <p>The students’ lawyer, Gustav Kawer, said that they had been detained for over a month. </p>
      <p>“Two in Timika and two in Wamena – all were released on a diversion program because they are underage,” Gustav told <i>The Jakarta Post</i> on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>A 2012 law on the child criminal justice system stipulates that children in the justice system must be put into diversion programs. </p>
      <p>Gustav said one of his clients in Wamena was arrested on Sept. 30 after being treated for bullet wounds suffered during the protest.</p>
      <p>He said his clients were not processed according to the correct legal procedures, that they had been kept in a storage room rather than a cell and that the diversion process had been unnecessarily prolonged. </p>
      <p>Papua People's Assembly (MRP) chairman Timotius Murib said that underage detainees should be processed quickly according to prevailing laws.</p>
      <p>“These children are the future so they should be handled correctly so that they are free from collective trauma,” he said. </p>
      <p>If not, “they might not be proud of being part of this nation,” Timotius added. (kmt)</p>
