      <p>These lads and lasses were all enjoying a night out on the Toon 11 years ago.</p>
      <p>As ever, we hope the last decade or so has been good to them.</p>
      <p>Their photos first appeared in the Chronicle’s weekly Bigg Night Out section during February 2008.</p>
      <p>In our regular feature, we showed people having fun in and around the bars of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle city centre</a>.</p>
      <p>But, what was happening in 2008?</p>
      <p>Here in the region, the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/angel-of-the-north">Angel of the North</a> was celebrating its 10th birthday; the ocean liner QE II was paying a last ever visit to the River Tyne; and Newcastle United legend <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/kevin-keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> returned to the club for a third time - although there wouldn’t be a fairy tale ending this time around.</p>
      <p>It was a year when North East filmgoers were flocking to see the likes of The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Slumdog Millionaire, Kung Fu Panda, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</p>
      <p>In the pop charts, we were listening to the likes of Adele, Duffy, Rihanna, Leona Lewis and Kelly Rowland.</p>
      <p>And on the box, we watched new shows and series including Ashes To Ashes, Lark Rise To Candleford, and Wallander.</p>
      <p>In February that year, the BBC announced the children’s TV school drama Grange Hill was to be axed after 30 years, while Aussie soap, Neighbours, ended its 22-year stint on the Beeb by moving to Channel 5.</p>
      <p>In the news 11 years ago was the disappearance of nine-year-old West Yorkshire schoolgirl Shannon Matthews. Her mother Karen would later be convicted of kidnapping her own daughter after hatching a plan to claim £50,000 reward money.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Heather Mills, who grew up in the North East, agreed a £24m divorce settlement with estranged husband and former Beatle, Sir Paul McCartney.</p>
      <p>Check out our photos from 11 years ago, and see if you recognise any familiar faces.</p>
