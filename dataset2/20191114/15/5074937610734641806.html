      <h1>Cedi depreciation declines following strong macro-economic fundamentals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:54:01+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Anane, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 14, GNA - The strong macro-economic fundamentals posted by the economy, has resulted in a significant decline in the rate of depreciation of the cedi.</p>
      <p>"The annual depreciation of the cedi to the US dollar between 2017 and 2019 has been the slowest since 2012."</p>
      <p>Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Minister of Finance, said this when he presented the 2020 Budget Statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Before we assumed office, the cedi depreciated by an annual average of 17.7% from 2013 to 2016. Since 2017, the cedi has depreciated by an average of 7.8%, the Minister said.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori-Atta said the weak fundamentals of the economy, caused the NDC government to seek a bail out from the IMF in 2015.</p>
      <p>"Ghana successfully exited the IMF program, when the fundamentals got strengthened under our competent economic management," he said.</p>
      <p>The Minister observed that the strength of Ghana's fundamentals was confirmed on March 16, 2019, by Standard and Poor's(S and P) Global, which confirmed Ghana's sovereign rating as B with a stable outlook, after upgrading Ghana's sovereign credit rating from B- to B, with a stable outlook last year.</p>
      <p>He said the upgrade was the first by S and P for Ghana in ten Years</p>
