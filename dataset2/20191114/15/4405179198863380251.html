      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/author/ashleigh-allsopp/" target="_blank">Ashleigh Macro</a></address>
      <p>If you're looking for a discount on the MacBook Air, you've come to the right place. We'll talk you though some of the best deals around, and explain whether they are really good deals, or just OK deals. We know exactly what the MacBook Air costs at Apple right now, so we know just how much of a discount you are getting - beware that because Apple recently discounted its MacBook Air, some deals aren't as good as resellers are making them out to be!</p>
      <p>We also know how to tell which MacBook Air is being sold - and whether it is a current model, or an old model. So don't fall in to the trap of spending more than you need to. Read on...</p>
      <p>The first thing you need to know is that at the end of 2018, Apple gave the MacBook Air a power boost, and, for first time since it launched 10 years previously, gave the much-loved Mac laptop a redesign. Then in July 2019 Apple made a slight change to the screen - adding True Tone, a technology that means that the colours and brightness can adjust depending on your surrounding light. Other than this change the 2018 and 2019 models are identical, the specs did not change when Apple updated the machines in July 2019. The price did change, however. </p>
      <p>The other change in July 2019 was that Apple stopped selling the older MacBook Air - which used to cost £949 in the UK, or $999 in the US. We think that the older model was overpriced and didn't recommend buying one at Apple's price. However, there may still be a few good deals on that older model - we really wouldn't recommend spending more than £700 on it, though.</p>
      <p>You can find out everything you need to know about the 2019 laptop in our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/mac-laptops/macbook-air-2019-3700470/">MacBook Air review</a>.</p>
      <p>You can buy a MacBook Air directly <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air">from Apple here</a>, but there are plenty of stores offering a discount on the new models so it's worth shopping around. In this article we'll tell you the best deals you can get on a new MacBook Air, as well as some great deals you can get on the older model. You'll also find some MacBook Pro and MacBook deals listed below as with a discount these might be a better offering than the MacBook Air is.</p>
      <h3>How much does the new MacBook Air cost?</h3>
      <p>When it launched in 2018 the MacBook Air was more expensive than the previous model was, starting at £1,199/$1,199. At the time Apple continued to sell the old 1.8GHz MacBook Air for £949. However, in 2019 Apple discontinued the £949 model and reduced the price of the new-style MacBook Air by £100.</p>
      <p>This is the current line up:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1.6GHz, Dual-Core, 8th gen (3.6GHz Turbo Boost), 128GB: £1,099/$1,099</li>
        <li>1.6GHz, Dual-Core, 8th gen (3.6GHz Turbo Boost), 256GB: £1,299/$1,299</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These specs are exactly the same as the 2018 model, apart from the addition of True Tone in the display. Prices are down £100 per machine compared to the 2018 model.</p>
      <p>It's not only the price of the standard model that has decreased. Apple also cut the price of some build-to-order options. For example, there is now the option of a 1TB SSD for £400/$400, rather than a 1.5TB SSD for £2,399/$2,399.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>16GB memory: +£180/$180 (£1,579/$1,579)</li>
        <li>512GB SSD storage: +£200/$200 (£1,599/$1,599)</li>
        <li>1.5TB SSD storage: WAS +£1,000/$1,000 (£2,399/$2,399) NOW 1TB SSD +£400/$400</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you were to choose all the build-to-order options the top-spec model would cost £1,879, rather than £2,579 as it did previously.</p>
      <p>You're here because you want to save even more money though, so read on to find the best deals!</p>
      <h3>Best MacBook Air Deals</h3>
      <p>You can browse through the best MacBook Air deals below. We also have deals for more MacBook Air as well as some other MacBook models further down in this article (in case you're not completely decided.)</p>
      <h4>MacBook Air 2019 model</h4>
      <p>Apple has a 'new' MacBook Air for 2019, but the only new thing about it is the introduction of True Tone to the screen (which means the screen can adjust to different lighting conditions) and a price drop from Apple. All the other specs are the same as the 2018 model. The MacBook Air price is now £100 less than it was, starting at £1,099.</p>
      <p>Price-cuts on the new MacBook Air are already starting to arrive, check them out below.</p>

      <h4>MacBook Air 2018 model</h4>
      <p>If you see a MacBook Air on sale it can be tricky to tell if it's the 2018 or 2019 model because the only difference is the addition of True Tone. Some deals may also look better than they are as the reseller isn't taking into account Apple's own price drop on the Air, which now starts at £1,099 rather than £1,199. However, if you find a good deal on the 2018 MacBook Air we recommend it, purely because it's practically identical to the 2019 model.</p>
      <table bordered="">
        <tr>
          <td>Retailer</td>
          <td>Price</td>

        <tr>
          <td colspan="4">Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h4>MacBook Air 2017 model</h4>
      <p>The 2017 MacBook Air was still on sale from Apple until July 2019. You may still be able to find a deal on the old-style MacBook Air, although we emphasise that the model may officially be from 2017, but the processor is from 2015, so it's not a modern Mac - that processor will soon be five years old!</p>
      <table bordered="">

      <p>Note that Apple put the price up by £100 back in July, so this is actually a better deal than it looks on Amazon. It's a great way to get a MacBook Pro with a very similar spec to the new 16in model for a lot less!</p>

      <p>Very has a slight discount on the 2018 MacBook Air (same spec as the 2019 model aside from True Tone). But as with the other Air deals, now that Apple's reduced pricing itself this deal's not as good as it was.</p>
