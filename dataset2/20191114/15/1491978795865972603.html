        <i>When Steven Lindberg took a closer look at his image of a deer taken near his Michigan home, he had a surprise</i>
      </p>
      <p>Five years ago, Steven Lindberg vowed to upload an image a day to Facebook, a largely unexceptional exercise that the retired <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan">Michigan</a> state legislator often conducted as he was walking his dog near his home in Marquette.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, Lindberg took a picture of a deer. Ordinarily, that would have been unexceptional, too: there are 30 million such animals in North America.</p>
      <p>But when Lindberg uploaded the image, he realized the buck had three antlers.</p>
      <p>Veterinarian Steve Edwards told the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/12/3-antlered-deer-spotted-photographer-michigans-upper-peninsula/2581933001/">Detroit Free Press</a> it was a “one-in-a-million” find. Others said the animal could be even rarer than that, and attributed the extra growth to damage to the pedicels, the structures in the skull that support antlers.</p>
      <p>Lindberg, 75 and a former hunter, told the Free Press he stopped shooting animals 20 years ago when he lost the desire to kill.</p>
      <p>“When I get a picture of a deer, I’m just as excited,” he said.</p>
