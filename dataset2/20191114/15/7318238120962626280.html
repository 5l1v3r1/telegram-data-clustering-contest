      <h1>Russia football team ditch new Adidas kit after flag colour criticism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:57:05+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>Russia's national football team are set to ditch their newly-made Adidas kit for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifier against Belgium this weekend after spotting an apparent oversight on the design.</p>
      <p>The new kit, which was revealed last week, features a red torso with striped red, blue and white sleeves in descending order, which is meant to resemble the Russian tricolour flag.</p>
      <p>But many have since pointed out that this order of stripes doesn't actually resemble the Russian flag at all — which is white, blue and red in descending order — and actually is closer to the Serbian flag instead.</p>

      <p>Speaking to AFP, the Russian Football Union said the team would continue playing in the kit it had used in previous matches.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Adidas launch of the kit pointed toward the striped sleeves as "reintroducing the strong, bold colours of the nation's flag".</p>
      <p>But the team's manager Stanislav Cherchesov said it was "interesting".</p>
      <p>He added: "When fans support the team by clapping with their arms in the air, you'll be able to see the Russian flag on the sleeves."</p>
      <p>Euronews has invited Adidas to respond to this article.</p>
