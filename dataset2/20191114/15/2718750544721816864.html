        <i>Could you?</i>

        <i>Could you? </i>
        <br/>
        <i>Could you …</i>
        <br/>
        <i>… Believe Pink would give anything other than an emotional awards-show performance?</i>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, so part of us wanted Pink to dramatically throw off her poncho to reveal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htaKHoihSSA">silks that would hoist her up</a> into a beautiful country-tinged aerial number during her performance of her ballad “Love Me Anyway” at last night’s CMA Awards. Of course, we got the next best thing: sweet, sweet harmonies with country-music singer Chris Stapleton. Pink and Stapleton performed for the audience with a pianist, backing guitar, and string quartet, because there’s no genre she can’t make her own. It’s pleasant and lovely to watch Stapleton and Pink post-apocalyptically harmonizing through the smoky-hazy orange lights and fog effect, <i>could you love me anyway / like it’s the end of the world?</i></p>
      <p>So sure, Kacey Musgraves. You might have won the CMA Award for Music Video of the Year for “Rainbow.” But never forget who the true queen of awards-show vocals is. Pink <a href="https://vimeo.com/147850776"><i>invented </i>rainbows</a>.</p>
