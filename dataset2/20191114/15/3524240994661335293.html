      <p>South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases on Thursday said they have not confirmed any Ebola cases in the country or neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>This follows media reports that a South African woman, staying in Ficksburg not far from neighbouring country Lesotho, was confirmed as the first case of Ebola in the country.</p>
      <p>“We have not had any positive Ebola cases in South Africa or neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>“This was the first small scale field simulation exercise to test preparedness.</p>
      <p>“The biosafety level-4 Lab has not been requested to test suspected Ebola cases for any neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>“As such, we have not had a positive Ebola case,’’ said NICD on its twitter account.</p>
      <p>They stated that the incident was a field simulation exercise to test Lesotho’s preparedness to handle the disease.</p>
      <p>“Chances of reaching South Africa are very slim, Nonetheless, South Africa has strong Ebola response systems that are in place, should there be a suspected case.</p>
      <p>“ If anything changes, we will report its findings to alert the public,’’ the NICD said.</p>
