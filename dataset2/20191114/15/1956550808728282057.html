      <p>Sharjah Art Foundation’s annual art book fair is back for a second year.<br/><br/>The event, which spans three days from Thursday November 14 until Saturday November 16, features 150 independent publishers and artists from across the globe, meaning you have even more choice than last year.<br/><br/>You’ll be able to pick up special prints, posters, art books and journals from the 55 booths and curated tables at the event at Bait Obaid Al Shamsi, the 174-year-old historical building in Arts Square.<br/><br/>If you’re a budding artist yourself, you won’t want to miss out FOCAL POINT’s programme of activities, which includes workshops on how to draw Manga, zine making, and free-hand drawing.<br/><br/>This year’s fair has a special focus on zines and comics, so anyone who’s working on their collection should pop in to see if they can nab those difficult-to-find editions hidden among the stacks.<br/><br/>The best part? Entry to the fair is completely free, as are all of the pop-up workshops that are suitable for both children and adults.<br/><br/>There’ll be live music performances from bands throughout the day, and, if you get peckish, there are plenty of food vendors and coffee stalls.<br/><br/>You can even turn your visit into a day out, as the Rain Room, the permanent installation in Al Majarrah Park, is within walking distance, as are six of Sharjah Art Foundation’s Autumn exhibitions.<br/><i>Free. Thu-Fri 4pm-10pm; Sat 2pm-9pm. Bait Obaid Al Shamsi, Corniche Street (06 568 5050).</i></p>
