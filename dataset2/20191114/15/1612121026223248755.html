      <p>After months of leaks and rumors, the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344621-motorola-razr-2019-launch/">Moto Razr</a> folding smartphone has finally been <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346395-motorola-unveils-the-foldable-razr-a-verizon-exclusive-launching-in-january/">unveiled</a> as a Verizon exclusive (and EE in the UK) that will go on sale in January 2020. Unlike Samsung’s bodged <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344800-samsung-galaxy-fold-durability-test/">Galaxy Fold </a>and Huawei’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345608-huaweis-mate-x-the-backwards-foldable-phone-ships-in-november-for-2400/">Mate X</a> (that still hasn’t launched), the Moto Razr stays true to its iconic predecessor’s clamshell design and simply opens up to reveal what a display that is now classed as a normal-sized, a 6.2-inch smartphone display. Another notable feature is the $1,500 price tag that may just make your wallet weep a little. If you are curious as to how Motorola developed this new, modern take on the legendary Razr, you are in luck because Moto has posted a video showing what happened behind the scenes, and we’ve embedded it for your enjoyment after the break.</p>

      <p>It seems like people fall into one of two camps. Either you love the nostalgic memories that this re-imagining of the original Razr brings and its different take on a foldable display, or you can’t look beyond its mid-range specs, expensive price tag, small capacity battery, and maybe even that it only unfolds into a normal phone-sized display. Despite all those reasons, I’m still a fan of folding smartphones and can’t wait to get my grubby hands on a Moto Razr demo unit.</p>
