      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:25:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>It will soon be time for the British public to vote in a general election to decide the political future of the country.</p>
      <p>Following further deadlock over how to approach the critical issue of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , MPs in the House of Commons have backed a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> on December 12 to allow people to vote on what comes next.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> leads the Conservative Party in the hopes of increasing their power in Westminster, facing the likes of the Leader of the Opposition and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> , and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> leader Jo Swinson.</p>
      <p>There will also be campaigns from the likes of the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Brexit Party, the DUP, Sinn Fein, and the Green Party.</p>
      <p>But who is predicted to come out on top?</p>
      <p>Here are the latest odds and polls</p>
      <p>Â </p>

      <p>Alternatively, <a href="https://sports.ladbrokes.com/en-gb/betting/politics/">Ladbrokes</a> also have the Conservatives set for the most seats at 1/16, with Labour at 10/1, the Liberal Democrats at 50/1, the Brexit Party at 250/1, and the Green Party at 500/1.</p>
      <p>They have a Conservative Majority most likely at 4/7, followed by No Overall Majority at 6/4, then a Labour majority at 25/1, a Liberal Democrat majority at 200/1, and a Green Party majority at 1000/1.</p>
      <p>It would appear that a Conservative Majority is still most likely, but is very closely followed odds for No Overall Majority.</p>
