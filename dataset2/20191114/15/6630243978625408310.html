      <h1>Kenya, Somalia to normalize relations after leaders meet in Nairobi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T15:35:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Abdur Rahman Alfa Shaban</a></address>
      <p>Despite a raging maritime boundary disagreement, leaders of Kenya and Somalia on Thursday agreed to normalize relations at a meeting in Nairobi.</p>
      <p>Kenya’s Uhuru Kenyatta and his Somali counterpart Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo reaffirmed the invaluable relations between the two neighbours during a joint press conference after a closed-door meeting.</p>
      <p>The Somali leader was part of world leaders who were in Kenya for the just-ended International Conference on Population and Development. This years’ was the 25th edition.</p>
      <p>Kenya’s Foreign Affairs chief, Monica Juma wrote on Twitter: “The two principals agreed to bring normality to our bilateral relations and do everything to ensure peaceful relations including obtaining visas on arrival to encourage free movement of our people.”</p>
      <p>The Somali leader also expressed gratitude to Kenya for its role in AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping mission fighting insurgent group, Al-Shabaab and its role in sheltering Somali refugees fleeing conflict back home.</p>
      <p>On the issue of the maritime boundary, Farmaajo said he had confidence that the International Court of justice, ICJ, seized with the matter will deliver a mutually acceptable resolution when it rules on the matter in the months ahead.</p>
