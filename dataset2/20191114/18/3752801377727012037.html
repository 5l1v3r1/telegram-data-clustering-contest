      <p>KwaZulu-Natal snake catcher Nick Evans could not believe his luck when he happened upon two pregnant green mambas - on two consecutive days.</p>
      <p>He was called out to a house in Shallcross on November 6, where he found the first pregnant mamba.</p>
      <p>"It's a beaut, she’s full of eggs," Evans can be heard shouting in excitement on a video as he holds the snake.</p>
      <p>The slithery serpent was curled up behind a washing machine when he found it.</p>
      <p>He told News24 green mambas were uncommon in areas like Shallcross as they generally lived in coastal areas. He suspects a small number of snakes may have found a new home in a river on a reserve close by.</p>
      <p>The second mamba was found in a retaining wall on the premises of a local school in Tongaat on November 7.</p>
      <p>At first glance, Evans thought the snake had just eaten but, little did know, he was in for his second surprise.</p>
      <p>"I caught a pregnant one yesterday in someone's kitchen. That's very exciting," Evans told onlookers.</p>
      <p>He explained to the crowd that it might have been looking for a spot to lay its eggs.</p>
      <p>According to him, the first snake carried nine eggs, while the second had 10.</p>
      <p>Evans will be on baby snake watch until the mothers give birth.</p>
      <p>"Once they give birth, I'll feed and then release them," he said.</p>
      <p>Last month, Evans <a href="https://www.news24.com/Video/SouthAfrica/News/watch-ssssurprise-33m-pregnant-python-rescued-from-kzn-river-20191101">rescued a pregnant 3.3m python from a river in KwaZulu-Natal</a>. </p>
