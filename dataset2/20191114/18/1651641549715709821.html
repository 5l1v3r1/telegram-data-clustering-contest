      <blockquote>
        <i>The design follows an Aquabrush print: a custom camouflage that was made exclusively for X019. Aquabrush is inspired by the traditional 1950’s lizard-brushstroke camouflage and the River Thames in London. The design brings together the origins of artistry in camouflage design and the celebration of the rich culture of the U.K., subtly integrating iconic landmarks in London and a section of the River Thames with the hallmark maharishi dragon.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The controller is limited to 1,000 units so if you want one of your own, you’ll have to act fast.
