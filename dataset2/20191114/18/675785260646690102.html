      <p>"There's risk of localised flooding and tricky driving conditions - with yellow warnings there."</p>
      <p>Sleet and snow will move in for parts of west England and Wales, with these wintery showers mainly falling on ground above 400m in the Welsh mountains.</p>
      <p>Rain is expected to turn to showers by the end of the night.</p>
      <p>Temperatures will remain cold overnight, with a widespread frost by Friday morning.</p>
      <p>By tomorrow, temperatures could plunge to as low as -6 on higher ground in Scotand.</p>
      <p>Friday promises to be brighter with more winter sunshine in parts.</p>
      <p>Aidan added: "Sunshine will come through for eastern England in complete contrast to Thursday's weather, but we will still see one or two showers for northern England, north east Scotland and parts of East Anglia and the south east, west Wales and Cornwall."</p>
      <p>On Friday, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland will enjoy some good November sunshine, feeling brighter, dry but chilly.</p>
