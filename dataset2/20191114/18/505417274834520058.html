        <b>Zach Elbouzedi’s second-half goal gave ten man Ireland a crucial victory away to Armenia to keep them top of their Euro 2021 qualification group.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite missing a host of starters, including suspended captain Jayson Molumby and the duo of Lee O’Connor and Troy Parrott, <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/kennedymarisa760/ireland-mccarthy-team-parrott/">who are both with the senior side</a>, Kenny’s men dominated proceedings throughout the first half but couldn’t quite find the opening goal.</p>
      <p>In the second 45, Ireland continued to put the pressure on and eventually broke the deadlock thanks to Waterford’s Elbouzedi who found himself on the end of a ball into the box from Adam Idah and the 21-year-old steadied himself and finished impressively past the Armenian goalkeeper.</p>

      <p>Ireland had been defeated for the first time in their group last month as they fell to Iceland in difficult conditions, but looked confident throughout as they created chances but failed to find the second goal.</p>
      <p>Four of Ireland’s starting back five were making their debuts in Yerevan but it was one of their more experienced players, West Brom’s Dara O’Shea, who found himself sent off with just fifteen minutes to go after a last ditch challenge on an Armenian player.</p>
      <p>Kenny’s side survived the late scare with their win meaning that they stay top of the group four points ahead of Iceland who have two games in hand.</p>

      <p>“I’m very pleased with the win”, Kenny told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWbPPac5k6Q&amp;feature=youtu.be">FAI TV following the game.</a></p>
      <p>“The players really worked hard for each other today, there was a real sense of team. We had a lot of changes from the previous game, with three of the back four and the goalkeeper making their debuts.</p>
      <blockquote>“When you’re putting them together over a couple of days you don’t have a lot of preparation, but they were so composed and did very well. We had a high-pressing game which Armenia struggled to live with, and we created a lot of great chances that we just couldn’t take.</blockquote>
      <p>“You think it might not be our night but persistence is important and we kept going.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted to get the win. We’ve had a brilliant campaign and then we had such a setback in Iceland with a defeat we didn’t deserve, so it was important to bounce back with a win here.”</p>

      <p>Ireland now move onto their next test as they face Sweden, whom they beat 3-1 away from home, at Tallaght Stadium on Tuesday and Kenny is hoping that The Boys in Green can take their strong momentum into another crucial clash.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big game on Tuesday, it would be great to have a good crowd. We’ve got to build momentum again after tonight’s win, and bring it into the game on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“It’s a home game for us at Tallaght, the games have been brilliant for us there, we haven’t conceded a goal, we had a full house against Italy and we’ve beaten Luxembourg and Armenia there so they have been great games and we look forward to going there on Tuesday.”</p>
