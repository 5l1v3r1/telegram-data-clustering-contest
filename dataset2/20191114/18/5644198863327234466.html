      <p>KUWAIT CITY: Kuwait's prime minister submitted his resignation on Thursday (Nov 14) along with his Cabinet, officials said, amid infighting between ministers and criticism of their performance.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Sheikh Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Sabah Mubarak Al-Sabah "submitted the resignation of the Cabinet to the emir ... in order to allow for a Cabinet reshuffle," government spokesman Tareq al-Mazrem said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Minister of Finance Nayef al-Hajraf and Minister of Public Works Jenan Bushehri resigned this month, with both under fire for alleged mismanagement of their portfolios and poor use of public funds.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, parliament also grilled Interior Minister Sheikh Khaled al-Jarrah Al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family, over similar accusations.</p>
      <p>Independent MP Saleh Ashour told AFP that as well as those criticisms, disputes between ministers over the current composition of the Cabinet had also triggered the resignation.</p>
      <p>Parliament speaker Marzouk al-Ghanem told reporters Thursday that "a large group of MPs believe that the problem lies in the government team because it is not homogenous".</p>
      <p>Kuwait is the only Gulf state with a fully elected parliament and the government is controlled by the ruling family.</p>
      <p>The oil-rich country has been shaken by political disputes between lawmakers and the government for over a decade, with parliament and Cabinets dissolved several times.</p>
      <p>A demonstration held outside the Kuwaiti parliament over alleged rampant corruption was reminiscent of past crises that have marred political life in the country.</p>
