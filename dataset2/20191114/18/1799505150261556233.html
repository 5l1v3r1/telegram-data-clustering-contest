      <p>(CN) – Archaeologists combing through dinosaur fossil sites in Japan have discovered a previously unknown bird species that soared through the skies over 120 million years ago. The pigeon-sized bird holds clues to the evolution of modern birds, according to a study released Thursday.</p>

      <p>Scientists consider the archaeopteryx, or bird-like dinosaur, to be the first known bird on the planet.</p>
      <p>The archaeopteryx, whose fossils were found in Germany, lived during the Late Jurassic period between 160 to 140 million years ago.</p>
      <p>But the archaeopteryx did not develop the fundamental flight mechanism that modern birds have.</p>
      <p>Birds flying over us today have a skeletal structure containing a pygostyle, a triangular plate located near the backbone that supports tail feathers, a key adaptation for flight.</p>
      <p>The earliest known birds with pygostyle skeletal structures appeared in the Cretaceous period about 120 million years ago.</p>
      <p>Cretaceous era bird fossils have been found only in northeastern China, Spain and Brazil, until now.</p>
      <p>While digging at a fossil site in central Japan in 2013, Takuya Imai of Fukui Prefectural University discovered a three-dimensionally preserved fossil of what has since been named fukuipteryx prima. The light brown-colored bird had a wide wingspan and a short tail feather.</p>
      <p>The primitive bird’s fossils are the first from the Cretaceous period to be found outside of China, according to the study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0639-4">Communications Biology</a>.</p>
      <p>Imai observed that the fukuipteryx prima had a fully formed pygostyle and shared several features with the archaeopteryx, including a wide wishbone, an unfused pelvis, and forelimbs.</p>
      <p>But researchers advance the theory that fukuipteryx prima’s pygostyle is simply a byproduct of tail reduction during evolution and is unrelated to flight.</p>
      <p>An early Cretaceous bird called the jeholorniformes lacked the pygostyle, for example, according to the study.</p>
