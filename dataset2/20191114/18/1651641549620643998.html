        <b>Soleil “Ewok” Wheeler, a deaf 14 year old Fortnite pro, has become the latest streamer to leave Twitch in favour of Microsoft’s Mixer platform.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following in the likes of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitchs-top-steamer-ninja-is-moving-exclusively-to-microsofts-mixer/">Tyler “Ninja” Blevins</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/another-twitch-star-moves-to-microsoft-mixer/">Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/king-gothalion-is-also-making-the-switch-from-twitch-to-mixer/">Cory “Gothalion” Michael</a>, and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/supergirl-guest-actor-rahul-kohli-streams-on-microsofts-mixer/">Supergirl Guest Actor Rahul Kohli</a>, Ewok has opted to stream exclusively on Mixer.</p>
      <p>Ewok <a href="https://twitter.com/Ewok/status/1194980606284849160">broke the news on Twitter</a> with a short video that shows her painting the Mixer logo on a wall.</p>

      <p>Ewok then confirmed the news with a link to her Mixer channel, which you can find <a href="https://mixer.com/ewok">by following the link here</a>. There’s also a limited-time offer where, for the next month, you can subscribe to Ewok on Mixer for completely free.</p>
      <p>The streamer rose to fame last year after being hosted on TimtheTatMan’s stream and quite literally blowing all of her Fortnite competitors out of the water. She later joined FaZe Clan in July 2019, making her the first girl to do so.</p>

      <p>If you want to get into Mixer, good news! <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-introduces-cheaper-mixer-subscriptions-to-support-streamers/">Microsoft has introduced cheaper Mixer subscriptions</a> so that you can support your favourite streamers without burning a hole in your pocket.</p>
      <p>Monthly subscriptions are now $4.99/month instead of $5.99/month, which means you can watch your favourites play games for the same price as a fancy cup of coffee.</p>
      <p>If you already have a Mixer account, consider checking out Mixer Academy, a <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/mixer-academy/">program that’s designed to let Mixer members learn how to be the best streamer, moderator, or power user around</a>.</p>
