        <i>Almost third of urgent housing budget is spent on emergency bed and breakfasts, data shows</i>
      </p>
      <p>The cost of housing homeless families in temporary accommodation has risen by 78% in five years to more than £1bn, according to the latest official data.</p>
      <p>A combination of soaring rents and more families without accommodation pushed spending on emergency housing to almost £1.1bn in England in the year to April 2019, analysis of figures from the Ministry of Housing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/communities">Communities</a> and Local Government shows.</p>
      <p>Almost a third of the budget (£344m) was spent on rooms in emergency bed and breakfasts, which are among the most expensive yet least comfortable forms of accommodation, particularly for families, according to housing experts.</p>
      <p>Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the “shocking” increase – up 9% year on year – was the result of a failure by successive governments to build affordable social housing.</p>
      <p>“What is even more shameful is that so much of this public money is lining the pockets of unscrupulous private landlords, who can charge desperate councils extortionate rates for grim B&amp;Bs, because there’s nowhere else for families to go,” Neate said.</p>
      <p>Shelter’s analysis shows that a 78% increase in spending on temporary accommodation in five years has far outstripped the 45% increase in the number of homeless households needing it. Similarly, the number of homeless families housed in B&amp;Bs has increased by 61%, yet the amount spent on their rents has risen by 111%.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Observer found that firms providing temporary accommodation in England’s top 50 homeless blackspots <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/13/private-landlords-profits-housing-crisis-homelessness-councils-england">received an average of £10,000 of public money for each booking</a>.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the GMB union called for local authorities to be given powers to take over long-empty dwellings to house homeless people. Research by the union found that in 2018 London had a total of 22,481 long-term vacant dwellings, 2,244 more than the year before. In the same period, 232,409 households were on local authority housing waiting lists in the city.</p>
      <p>Neate added: “No family should have to live in a tiny room where there’s nowhere to even cook a meal, or any safe space for their children to play. This is a crisis we cannot allow politicians to ignore during this election. Social housing must be at the heart of every manifesto.”</p>
