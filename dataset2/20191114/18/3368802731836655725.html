      <p>Terming the crisis artificial, senior treasury and opposition bench lawmakers yesterday came down heavily on the government in parliament for failing to check skyrocketing onion prices.</p>
      <p>They said people were suffering and the government’s failure to bring down the prices of the daily essential would trigger negative reaction from the people. </p>
      <p>The MPs, taking the floor on points of order, said there was “no shortage” of onions in the market and the crisis was artificially created. </p>
      <p>The prime minister was present when lawmakers vented their displeasure. Later, she too said that unscrupulous traders were hoarding onions.</p>
      <p>Awami League senior parliamentarian Mohammad Nasim said, “Commerce minister [Tipu Munshi] and finance minister [AHM Mustafa Kamal] are saying that onions are being imported, then why prices are shooting up every day? </p>
      <p>“It is not understandable. It is tarnishing our image. It will be bad for us if people start to react,” said Nasim, who launched the criticism. </p>
      <p>“When the commerce minister makes statement that price of a kg of onions will not come down to Tk 100, then traders get the opportunity [to hike the price even more],” he added. </p>
      <p>Nasim urged the commerce and finance ministers to take effective steps and be more active to check the price spiral. </p>
      <p>Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Commerce Tofail Ahmed said onion prices further increased due to cyclone Bulbul.</p>
      <p>“I am really sad to say that price of a kg is now Tk 200. We have never thought that price of a kg of onions will reach Tk 200,” said the former commerce minister. </p>
      <p>Yesterday, onions were actually being sold for as high as Tk 220 a kg in retail markets.  </p>
      <p>Tofail urged the finance minister to withdraw all kinds of duties on onion imports to manage the crisis. </p>
      <p>Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haque suggested drives against unscrupulous traders to control the prices.     </p>
      <p>“We see that Phensidyl traders are getting killed in shootouts. It will be an example if onion traders responsible for the price hike die in shootouts.” </p>
      <p>He urged Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to “take personal initiative” to import onions from India. </p>
      <p>BNP lawmaker Harunur Rashid said people were making fun of the skyrocketing onion prices on social media. “The government should be more active in controlling the prices.” </p>
      <p>Speaking about the soaring prices of onions, Hasina in her winding-up speech for the 5th session of the 11th parliament said the government would sell 50,000 tonnes of onions in the open markets in districts to curb rising prices.</p>
      <p>She said the government has already taken steps to import onion from different countries, including Egypt and Turkey.</p>
      <p>“LCs [letters of credit] have been opened for importing 50,000 tonnes of onions ... These onions will reach within a few days. We will give these onions to TCB [Trading Corporation of Bangladesh] to carry this to districts on trucks.</p>
      <p>“We are aware about it and alert so that it [crisis] cannot deteriorate further.”</p>
      <p>The PM said the TCB was selling onions for Tk 45-50 per kg at different places.</p>
      <p>Hasina said officials during drives found onions going bad in storages but those were not being sold.</p>
      <p>She said that usually farmers grow onion once a year. Researchers are working so that it could be grown round the year,” she added.</p>
      <p>Hasina said onions were Rs 100 a kg across India except one state.</p>
      <h3>PRICES SOARING </h3>
      <p>When lawmakers were vocal in parliament, the prices of the essential spice were making new records. </p>
      <p>Within a day, the prices went up by Tk 30-40 per kg. </p>
      <p>Yesterday afternoon, a kg of onions was being sold for Tk 220 in the capital. </p>
      <p>The Burmese variety was selling for Tk 190-200 a kg and the Egyptian ones Tk 170-180.  </p>
      <p>The Daily Star found the prices at two kitchen markets and several retail stores in the city’s Karwan Bazar, Moghbazar, and Farmgate areas. </p>
      <p>During the visits, buyers were seen arguing with sellers, expressing frustration, and anger. Some were even mocking the “ridiculous” prices. </p>
      <p>“It is simply fraud and anarchy. A section of traders is making extra profit, but the government is doing nothing,” said Muhammad Mustafa in Karwan Bazar at one stage of his argument with a retailer. </p>
      <p>He had gone to four-five shops but left the market without buying onions. </p>
      <p>Shopper Saiful Islam said onions have no alternative and it was hard to stop using them. </p>
      <p>“I think that the people of low-income group, like us, will have to stop onion consumption now.”  </p>
      <p>Wholesalers and retailers were blaming “supply shortage” for the price hike. </p>
      <p>“The way the shortage is, I think many traders will not be able to buy onions in the coming days,” said Md Hridoy, a wholesaler in Karwan Bazar. </p>
      <p>However, the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection, during a drive in the city’s Shyambazar, found no supply shortage.  </p>
      <p>Shyambazar is one of the country’s largest spice wholesale markets. </p>
      <p>“We found sufficient quantity of onions in the market. We asked the traders why they were giving the excuse of supply shortfall, but none of them could give us a satisfactory answer,” said Abdul Jabbar, an assistant director of the directorate. </p>
