      <p>RetcH has been applying pressure this whole year. Kicking off the year with <i>Rich Than The Opps</i> was already a sure sign that he about to have a good year but it felt like he remained a bit low key following its release. Thankfully, he came out with more music following the summer and today, he dropped off his latest project, <i>Still Goin' Up.</i> The project includes seven tracks in total with no features.</p>
      <p><i>Still Goin' Up</i> comes a few months after he released his joint project with Gu Mitch, <i>GuWiiMoney</i>. He followed that up with his <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ScHoolboyQ/profile">ScHoolboy Q</a> collaboration "On Me." Hopefully, he maintains his pace in 2020. We're excited to hear whatever else he has in store in the future.</p>
      <p>Peep his new project below.</p>
