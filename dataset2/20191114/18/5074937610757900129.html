      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:23:39+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Yaw Ansah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA - Mrs Jean Mensa, the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission, has charged newly appointed officers of the Commission to exhibit a high level of integrity, fairness and transparency. </p>
      <p>She counseled the personnel to create a level playing field for all parties and conduct their official activities without fear or favour.</p>
      <p>Mrs Mensa was speaking at a two- day orientation programme organised for 158 newly appointed officers on Wednesday in Accra.</p>
      <p>Congratulating them on their appointments, the Chairperson encouraged the officers to exhibit a high level of professionalism and discipline.</p>
      <p>She said, “For those who have been deployed to the field, you will have the responsibility of being entrusted with the commission’s resources that is funds and property. We expect you to be honest and apply the funds for the purpose for which they were allocated.</p>
      <p>“Any violation of this policy will not be tolerated. The Commission will not take lightly acts of dishonesty”.</p>
      <p>Dr Bossman Eric Asare, the Deputy Chairman in charge of Corporate Services, advised the officers to remain non-partisan in the discharge of their duties and also strive for excellence wherever they were posted.</p>
      <p>He urged them to match their actions and inactions with the confidence reposed in them by the Commission in appointing them as officers.</p>
      <p>Mr Samuel Tettey, the Deputy Chairman of Operations, admonished them to work together in harmony with their colleagues to achieve the overall objective of the Commission.</p>
      <p>Present at the orientation were Mrs. Rebecca Adjalo, Ms. Adwoa Asuama Abrefa, Commission Members as well as directors of the EC.</p>
