      <h1>Pimco Says a ‘Comprehensive’ U.S.-China Deal Is Still Far Off</h1>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Nicola Mai isn’t holding his breath for U.S. and Chinese officials to resolve their differences and pass a sweeping trade agreement.</p>
      <p>While he expects a limited deal that stops a further escalation of trade tension, a more substantial truce doesn’t yet seem to be in the cards, Mai, a London-based sovereign credit analyst and portfolio manager, told Bloomberg TV on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“To find a more comprehensive deal, you need to deal with more significant issues like technology transfer and intellectual property,” he said. “It looks like we’re still far from that.”</p>
      <p>Trade woes are weighing on China’s already sluggish growth, which makes a deal in the nation’s best interest, according to Mai. Structural factors such as de-leveraging and a change of its economic model also put growth under pressure and may encourage the government to approach a pact with the U.S., he said.</p>
      <p>In the U.S., meantime, data may also signal a weaker economy as the year’s end approaches, meaning the Federal Reserve may actually have further room to reduce rates, he said.</p>
