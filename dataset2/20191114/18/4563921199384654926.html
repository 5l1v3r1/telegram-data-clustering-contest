      <h1>Beyond the dire needs of Iraq’s demonstration: National renaissance and a new challenge to Iran</h1>

      <p>For many, Iraqis have long been gone into hibernation to hold the politicians accountable for corruption in OPEC’s second-largest oil producer. So the first of October 2019  was a turning point when the young Iraqis have taken the streets in Baghdad, and to gather hugely in the symbolic place of Tahrir square, which separates a hundred meters of the Republic Bridge from the green zone. Shockingly the contagion of the protest spilt over into the other Shiite-dominated cities in southern the country, such as<a href="https://www.shafaaq.com/en/iraq-news/30-killed-and-more-than-2300-injured-in-a-new-statistic-of-the-demonstrations-in-iraq/"> Wasit, Basra, Maysan, Dhi Qar, Muthanna, Babylon, and Diwaniyah.</a></p>
      <p>Several demonstrations erupted in different parts of Iraq over last years to be sure, yet none of which was as spontaneous and outstanding as October’s one. Youths have taken the initiative without support neither from clerics nor any political party. The grievances have, primarily, limited to the basic needs of offering jobs and making substantial strides in services. Though, quickly, inflated to change the government whom the wrathful youths blame for turning a blind eye to the corruptors.</p>
      <p>In this circumstance of the unconscious co-presence, the protestors unprecedentedly overstepped their differences to rally around the Iraqi flag. Concurrently, they lambaste Iran for meddling into their affairs. That was a grave alarming for Iran’s policies not only in Iraq but inside Iran also regarding its populace is upset about the current economic crisis due to the US sanctions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Iraqi government in predicament  </b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2018, the Adeel Abdul-Mahdi’s government was formed by a fragile contract between al-Fatah and al-Binna Alliances plus Kurd’s bloc. Abdul-Mahdi was one of the dissenters who once received by Iraqis with flowers bouquet and festoon when he returned home after the US invasion in 2013. At that time, most of the current adolescent protestors were either had a few years or not yet born; nonetheless, they grew up on the pledges of the successive governments that didn’t amount to more than repetitive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/iraqi-protesters-demonstrations-month-of-violence">slogans</a>.</p>
      <p>On the 25th of October, the tight deadline for the government to commence decisive reformations came to an end without concrete change. Against this backdrop, the second wave of anti-government campaign erupted, this time more massively to exceed Baghdad to disseminate into the other southern cities of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/iraqi-protesters-demonstrations-month-of-violence">country</a>. Influx of all walks of life have joined in with the angry mob what put the government between the devil and the deep blue sea.</p>
      <p>First option for Abdul-Mahdi was to call for an early election that means dissolving the parliament, as per (64) article of the constitution, that required the absolute majority of <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;q=Iraq&amp;status=in_force&amp;status=is_draft">its representatives upon the prime minister request and the President’s consent</a>. Practically such a process is difficult to achieve timely considering the current government has yielded from intricate coalition of competitive parties. Another troublesome article of the constitution is of the interim sixty days in which the government converts into a <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;q=Iraq&amp;status=in_force&amp;status=is_draft">caretaker government</a> until new government receive the office, that means to be paralysed to achieve the urgent reforms sought by the angry youths. On similar premise was the answer of the prime minister to the plea of well-known <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50248954">cleric Muqtada al-Sadr for the former to resign</a>.</p>
      <p>The second alternative is to actualize swiftly the dire needs of the protestors who are significantly increasing in number and raising their demands. The prime minister, however, preferred remaining in the office so it can work on the people’s needs, for the time being at least until the two blocs in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50248954">the parliament form a new government</a>. The protestors have perceived these gestures suspiciously, arguing whether a pile of pledges haven’t realized within years, they wouldn’t definitely be achieved over a few months. In a desperate attempt to appease the demonstrators, Iraqi <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191101-iran-anxious-as-popular-movements-threaten-its-influence-in-iraq-and-lebanon">President Barham Salih delivered live televised speech</a> promised to hold an early election, reversely, people’s reactions became far more violent.</p>
      <p>Whether the government would answer protestors’ call to step down, or it would utterly resist, the essential question remains is how to fulfil the rest of their demands. Especially, they made their claim quite lucid; the “real country” is sought for, not merely socio-economic reforms.</p>
      <p>
        <b>From dire needs to National renaissance   </b>
      </p>
      <p>There is little doubt that Britain had established Iraq with multi-identities in the 1920s, composing of Sunni, Shiite, and Kurds, that shaped, afterwards, the ruling elites which would be in enduring conflict for decades to come Ironically, after 2003, the same paradigm has been rearticulated by the US civil governor to compose the Iraqi political system of different ethnic and sectarian elites in order allegedly to avoid marginalising any community. These elites, however, adopted increasingly extreme stands on their constituencies’ issues for their own political purpose that indulged the country into endless chaos for over sixteen years.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding, in a much similar trajectory to many states of the Arab Spring, some impoverished segments in Baghdad have begun to protest sporadically, then the sentiment has spread rapidly like wildfire amongst Iraqi youths. The protest rose a severe challenge as much to the official government as to the politically active elites. when <a href="https://atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/iraqi-protestors-unite-behind-demands-not-sectarian-identities/">the demands peaked to expel all the political parties whom the protestors accuse of foreign allegiance</a>. Nonetheless, couple of incidents got the government into a tight corner; on the one hand, students of the colleges and even primary schools abruptly got out of their institution, waving the flag and singing the national anthem collectively. On the other hand, the demonstration blew up in the Shiite holy city of Kerbala which supposedly supports wholeheartedly the Shiite-dominated government. The situation aggravated when the furious people have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/iraqi-protesters-attack-iran-consulate-karbala-191103232545555.html">set fire to the Iranian consulate In Kerbala.   </a> </p>
      <p>Noteworthy, these public claims have also brought about a couple of neoteric events that might reproduce the Iraqi identity, if not reintroduce it differently. First: the youths who have mainly led the public rally have vowed to fly nothing but Iraq flag despite <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/10/iraq-protests-reasons-renaissance.html">the majority of them were from the Shiite sect.</a> Second: in unusual phenomenon after 2003, the women from diverse speciality stood shoulder to shoulder with the men despite the brutal reaction of the security forces. Together they are chanting slogans against the politicians and clerics too; <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/women-come-to-the-fore-in-iraq-protests-1.932768">some of those women even didn’t put a veil on</a>.</p>
      <p>Needless to say that the demonstrators founded for a new political practice within which the prospective governments would be responsible not only to their political collations but to the laypeople as well. Ultimately,  the protesters need to incarnate their movement as a social entity to maintain constant momentum on political life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Iran is anxious</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the eve of the collapse of the tyrant government in Baghdad, Iran emerged as the most influential player, benefiting from its historical religious and cultural ties as well as a long shared border of1400  km with Iraq. It developed complicated relationships with all competitive political groups in Iraq, especially with those who took Iran their exile during Saddam Hussein’s rule. It has significantly entrenched its clout after defeating ISIS in 2014, by backing up each of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/iran-support-iraq-open-syria-border-1462444"> Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi forces including the Popular Mobilization Forces.</a></p>
      <p>Therefore, the anti-Iranian demonstration shocked the Iranian leaders seeing the protesters are not their traditional foe in Iraq, Sunni sect, instead they are mostly kids from<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/iraqi-protesters-demonstrations-month-of-violence"> the pious Shiite neighborhoods.</a> Iran, publically, downplayed the effectiveness of the protest, and they connected the Iraqis’ movement to US-sedition. Additionally, on October 6, 2019, <a href="https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1180945275306889216?lang=en">the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeted</a> on his official account “Iran and Iraq are two nations whose hearts &amp; souls are tied together through faith in God, love for Imam Hussein and the progeny of the Prophet. This bond will grow stronger day by day. Enemies seek to sow discord but they’ve failed and their conspiracy won’t be effective”.  </p>
      <p>On the contrary, the Iraqi streets exploded in outrage from Iran and its affiliations inside the country, particularly, when anonymous snipers killed dozens of them. While Iraqis accused Iran and its affiliates of the executions, Iran claimed the assassinators are from the Iranian opposition of <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/10/iran-media-claims-foreign-influence-iraq-protests.html">Mujahedin-e Khalq</a> in Iraq. They sneaked in the crowd of demonstrations, pretending they are  Iranian security forces, so the Iraqi would attribute their murders to Iran. However, the demonstrators have attacked the buildings of all parties, and they executed <a href="https://shafaaq.com/en/iraq-news/director-of-asaib-ahl-al-haq-and-his-brother-killed-southern-iraq/">two leaders</a> of full-hearted pro-Iran militia, Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq in Maysan province. Furthermore, many <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/popular-protests-deal-blow-iraq-iran-ties">effigies of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani were insultingly burnt</a>, that even occurred repeatedly in Shiite-dominated cities in southern Iraq.</p>
      <p>These rapidly spiralling events in Iraq imposed new burdens on Iran to unobstructedly continue its strategies in the region, chiefly because:</p>
      <p>First: As Iraq is a sole conduit for it to elude <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/18/trump-sanctions-iran-again-inching-toward-economic-blockade-saudi-oil-rouhani/">the US sanctions</a>, Tehran doesn’t tend to compromise the domination upon it.</p>
      <p>Second: Iraq presents the strategic corridor of what once King Abdullah of Jordan called ” <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/iran-and-shiite-crescent-myths-and-realities">Shia Crescent</a>“, in which Iran domination stretch from Iraq to Syria and Lebanon reaching to the Mediterranean sea.</p>
      <p>Third; Iranians’ worry is the Iraqi demonstration might spill over into their constituencies at home, especially Iranians are suffering from the current economic and financial hardships due to the last package of the US sanction. According to the International Monetary Fund (<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20191101-iran-anxious-as-popular-movements-threaten-its-influence-in-iraq-and-lebanon">IMF</a>), Iran GDP anticipated to shrink by 9.5 per cent at the end of 2019, after it grew healthy last year to reach 4.8 percent.   </p>
      <p>Though seems it is not as capable as used to be in the last ten years in Iraq, Iran attempted despairingly to contain the demonstration. For that reason, the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/anti-government-protests-in-iraq-and-lebanon-threatening-iran-s-regional-influence-1.8059140">Iranian Gen</a>. Qassim Soleimani flew by helicopter to meet with the Iraqi prime minister and politicians. Perhaps he realized now the demonstration is much immense than the heavily fortified of Green Zone where he held his meetings.  After all, these social movements of anti-sectarianism would more or less make the Iranian domination upon the surrounding region inoperative in the near future.</p>
