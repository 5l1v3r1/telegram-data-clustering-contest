      <p>Sandringham Estate plays host to the royal family each Christmas, but three members of the family are expected to be absent this year.</p>
      <p>Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and their son, Archie, will not be with his family for the holidays. Instead, they announced they will be spending Christmas with Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/11/13/prince-harry-meghan-archie-skipping-queens-christmas/4180668002/">USA Today reported</a>.</p>
      <p>In an official statement, Buckingham Palace said the couple have spent the past two Christmas celebrations at the estate and have made the decision with the support of Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace officials said they are following precedent set by other members of the royal family, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/11/13/prince-harry-meghan-archie-skipping-queens-christmas/4180668002/">USA Today reported</a>.</p>

      <p>In 2016, William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and their children spent time with Kate's parents instead of attending celebrations at Sandringham, <a href="https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-are-skipping-christmas-with-the-royal-family-this-year/">People Magazine reported</a>.</p>
      <p>While they may not be at Sandringham, palace officials have not said specifically where Harry, Meghan and Archie will be with Ragland.</p>
      <p>The family may travel to the United States or Ragland may spend time in the U.K., <a href="https://www.etonline.com/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-wont-be-spending-archies-first-christmas-with-the-royal-family">Entertainment Tonight reported</a>.</p>
