      <p>When he was at the peak of his powers Teko Modise was one of the glamour boys of Mzansi football and once got around in a stylish Aston Martin worth well over the R1 million mark.</p>
      <p>Modise starred for Orlando Pirates, although he stay at the club was marred by their barren spell. He later joined Mamelodi Sundowns where he achieved incredible success, most notably the 2016 CAF Champions League.</p>
      <p>Now retired, the 37-year-old revealed details of his flashy Aston Martin DB9 in his memoire that was released in 2017.</p>

      <p>Modise revealed that he forked out a mammoth R22 000 a month on the car, which according to their website, is well worth over the R1.2 million mark.</p>
