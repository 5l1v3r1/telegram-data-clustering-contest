      <h1>Target To Offer Free Same-Day Delivery Trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:29:34+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>The Target app is integrating with Shipt for same-day delivery, sometimes within one hour, Target said in a <a href="https://corporate.target.com/article/2019/11/shipt-on-target-app">press release </a>on Thursday (Nov. 14).</p>
      <p>Same-day delivery will be free for orders of $75 or more from Nov. 17 through Nov. 26.</p>
      <p>“Millions of guests love using the <a href="https://corporate.target.com/">Target</a> app to shop, save and get what they need quickly – and it’s a game-changer during the busy holiday season,” said Dawn Block, senior vice president of digital for Target. She added that offering same-day delivery makes holiday shopping easier and faster.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.shipt.com/">Shipt</a> shoppers will personally fulfill orders and bring items directly to customers’ homes, offices, hotels and other locations. Users will also get benefits, including 5 percent off for purchases made using a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2019/target-touts-omnicommerce-as-the-secret-to-its-big-earnings-beat/">Target</a> RedCard as well as special offers.</p>
      <p>Target shoppers can get same-day delivery by becoming a Shipt member or by paying a $9.99 delivery fee per order. Newcomers to Shipt get a free four-week trial membership.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/ecommerce/2019/same-day-delivery-wars-amazon-walmart-sams/">Target acquired Shipt </a>in 2017 for $550 million. Previously, Target customers could get same-day delivery by being a Shipt member for $99 a year, which is still an option.</p>
      <p>Walmart ramped up its next-day delivery service ahead of the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/back-to-school-season-fuels-retail-activity-and-innovation/">back-to-school shopping season</a>.</p>
      <p>Groceries are also being used in tandem with faster deliveries, underscoring how more shoppers are becoming comfortable with ordering grocery items online. Walmart’s latest offering in this area is the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/walmart/2019/walmart-rolls-out-paid-membership-for-unlimited-delivery/:~:targetText=Walmart%20has%20introduced%20a%20new,month,%20according%20to%20the%20company.">Delivery Unlimited subscription</a>, which offers consumers the option of either paying $12.95 per month or $98 per year to shop online and have their groceries delivered as often as they like, with no restrictions on delivery times.</p>
      <p>In April, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2019/prime-delivery-day-packages/">Amazon</a> said it would spend $800 million to slash delivery times from two days to one day for its millions of Prime customers. One-day and same-day delivery is an option for some goods, depending on the market.</p>
      <p>Alcohol, groceries and countless other products are all part of the same-day delivery mix. Consumers can expect more moves on this front in the coming months and into 2020.</p>
