      <p>Paramount Pictures has been developing<b><i> Beverly Hills Cop 4 </i></b>for a few years, and now that it’s finally ready to go, they’ve ditched it and handed it off to Netflix.</p>
      <p>Netflix recently released <b>Eddie Murphy</b>’s new comedy <i>Dolemite Is My Name</i>, and it makes sense that they’d want to stay in business with Murphy. <i>Dolemite Is My Name </i>was a great movie, and fans have been looking forward to seeing him reprise his role as Axel Foley.</p>
      <p>There are no details on the story, but Foley, a street-smart Detroit cop, will find himself transplanted back to the streets of Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p><b>Bob Bakish</b>, CEO of Paramount’s parent company Viacom, is the one who confirmed the film project was moving to Netflix and that they would be licensing the rights of the franchise to them. However, Paramount Pictures still plans on producing and releasing Murphy’s <i>Coming 2 America</i>.</p>
      <p>The deal also enables Netflix to produce one more <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> sequel if they want to.</p>
