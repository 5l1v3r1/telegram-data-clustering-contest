      <h2>Love Island's Amber shows off another winning look as she undergoes another stunning hair transformation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:23:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Love Island's Amber Gill has fascinated the nation with her array of transformations.</p>
      <p>And the 2019 winner wowed her fans once again when she unveiled another dramatically different look on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Amber opted for a change of hairstyle entirely as she regrouped with her Love Island besties Anna Vakili and Yewande Bialas.</p>
      <p>Typically known for her bouncy corkscrew curls, the Love Island star got everyone doing double takes when she arranged her locks in loose waves.</p>
      <p>The glamorous MissPap ambassador kept her caramel-coloured style, although she decided to change up the style of her natural curls.</p>

      <p>In a series of Instagrams, Amber drew attention to her new hairdo by filming a number of pieces to camera.</p>
      <p>The stunning model touched her face with her hands, framing her face, and ensuring all eyes were on her.</p>
      <p>Amber would have been almost unrecognisable if she hadn't been hanging out with her usual Love Island crowd.</p>

      <p>Despite having a very distinctive look with her springy curls, Amber has unveiled a number of transformations since leaving the villa to wow her fans.</p>
      <p>Most notably, the Love Island beauty had all the attention on her when she sported bouncy black waves that were nothing like her natural locks.</p>
      <p>Amber had made the epic entrance at her hotly-anticipated launch of her clothing range with MissPap, in London at a bash attended by the great and the good of the Love Islanders.</p>
      <p>Previously, the reality star has talked about how she maintains her lush locks and keeps it in tip top condition.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/love-islands-amber-gill-knows-curls-talks-caring-black-hair-less-washes-better-10904061/">The Metro</a> : "I wash it about once a week, I could push it to two weeks if I wanted to.</p>
      <p>"With my kind of hair, the less washes the better.</p>
      <p>"I just thicken it with loads of products, loads of thick, premium products, and then just leave it to air dry. Thatâ€™s all I do."</p>
