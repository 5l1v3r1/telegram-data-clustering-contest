      <p>In case you missed it, 11 Bit Studios’ <b><i>This War of Mine</i></b> turns the big five today. And in celebration of the game’s successes, the devs have released a free update to the game entitled <b><i>This War of Mine: Final Cut</i></b>.</p>
      <p><i>Final Cut</i> not only has goodies like a new character, new classic scenario, and all of the locations from the game’s Stories DLCs filled with more quests and events, it also gives the graphics a boost with 4K UI adjustments, remastered versions of all the classic levels and 21:9 aspect ratio support.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to put the last touch to this phenomenon. The phenomenon, which made us who we are today as a team, equally in terms of creative fearlessness and business direction, and helped us pave our further way,” says Przemyslaw Marszał, art director at 11 bit studios.</p>
      <p>“We think of the <i>Final Cut</i> as a closing episode to the one-of-a-kind series This War of Mine has been. It will remain precious to our hearts and I don’t know what ideas the future will bring but <i>Final Cut</i> is final by no means.”</p>
      <p>And if you haven’t played the game yet, both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/282070/This_War_of_Mine/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/this_war_of_mine?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=20191114_thiswarofmine_entw&amp;utm_term=EN">GOG.com</a> are having a discount on the game right now.</p>
