      <p>Dana Gunders says there are more and more partnerships developing to address food waste. NextCourse recently did a project with the Climate Collaborative, which is helping natural foods retailers implement tools to reduce their food waste. Gunders says sustainability professionals working to reduce food waste should not shy away from messaging around this issue. "People like to see that their employers are working on something like food waste reduction," she said.</p>
