      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-reunion-special-works-at-hbo-max-1254331">The Hollywood Reporter </a>says a Friends reunion with the full cast and creators being part of it is in the works.</p>
      <p>The hit TV series celebrates its 25th anniversary while insiders revealed that the six core stars and creators of the NBC comedy from Warner Bros. TV are in discussion to reunite on HBO Max.</p>
      <p>The unscripted reunion special will feature Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer including series creators David Crane and Martha Kauffman.</p>
      <p>However, the deal is far from done as details are still being ironed out. The challenge is to sort out everyone’s schedules once they complete the deals.</p>

      <p>There is also a possibility that the talks might not work out and the whole thing could collapse.</p>
      <p>When asked for comments, HBO Max and producers WBTV remained mum.</p>
      <p>Friends found new audiences at its streaming on Netflix after the news of the reunion special.</p>
      <p>At the end of the year, Friends will be leaving Netflix and will be available on WarnerMedia-backed HBO Max.</p>
      <p>There has been no confirmation of the $15 monthly subscription platform launch date.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that WarnerMedia reclaimed streaming rights to Friends for its own platform for $85 million per year for five years ($425 million).</p>
      <p>WarnerMedia outbid Netflix and the streaming service paid $80 million to $100 million to keep Friends on the service for 2019.</p>
      <p>Bob Greenblatt, WarnerMedia Entertainment and direct-to-consumer chairman have been the driving force pushing for the Friends reunion which will do well with HBO Max’s debut and the series’ new streaming home.</p>
      <p>The fact that the cast is willing to do it is an accomplishment in itself.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the cast and creators have remained steadfast that they would not do any sort of scripted revival since the series wrapped its 10-season run.</p>

      <p>To honour legendary director and producer James Burrows, NBC staged a mini-Friends reunion in 2016.</p>
      <p>Excluding Perry, five of the six stars were part of the show that also included stars from Will &amp; Grace, Cheers and The Big Bang Theory.</p>
      <p>On Oct 27, Aniston denied there will be a Friends reboot to TV host Ellen DeGeneres but said, “We would love for there to be something, but we don’t know what that something is. So we’re just trying. We’re working on something.”</p>
      <p>The actress returned to television on Nov 1 on the premiere of Apple TV+’s The Morning Show.</p>
      <p>It is her first TV series regular role since she completed Friends. Aniston acts opposite her Friends on-screen sister, Reese Witherspoon on The Morning Show.</p>
      <p>She also just joined Instagram recently, uploading a photo of her and her Friends co-stars.</p>
      <p>Warner Bros. TV, Friends producer has been busy celebrating the show’s 25th anniversary, with iconic pop-ups of Central Perk, replica couches places at landmarks around the world and special theatrical screenings of the beloved series.</p>
      <p>Experts believe an upstart streaming service like HBO Max would do well with must-see TV series like a Friends reunion.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Disney’s streaming service launched its highly expected Star Wars scripted drama The Mandalorian.</p>
