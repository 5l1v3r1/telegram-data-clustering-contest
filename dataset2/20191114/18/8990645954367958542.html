      <p>Here’s one for the fans of all things Dr. Pepper.</p>
      <p>It’s no secret we Texans love all things Texas and Dr. Pepper is no exception. The soda was created in Waco back in 1885 and the headquarters are currently located in Plano.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wideopencountry.com/dr-pepper-jelly-is-real-and-you-can-actually-make-it-at-home/">Wide Open Country</a> has shared the recipe for Dr. Pepper jelly and it’s surprisingly simple. I’ve also included a handy video that’ll walk you through the process.</p>
      <p>1. Add 4 cups of Dr. Pepper soda to a large pot</p>
      <p>2. Bring the pot to a full rolling boil for 5 minutes</p>
      <p>3. Remove from heat and stir in one pack of sure-jell with a metal spoon</p>
      <p>4. Combine sugar to the pot (4 cups sugar)</p>
      <p>5. Bring the pot back to the stove and heat to a boil, keep boiling for 2 minutes</p>
      <p>6. While the jelly is boiling, prepare your jars. Put them in a pot of hot (not boiling) water that covers them completely and put on the stove to keep warm</p>
      <p>7. Do the same for the jar lids (put them in hot water in a large saucepan)</p>
      <p>8. After 2 more minutes of boiling, remove the jelly from the stove and let it cool slightly before pouring into your jars (use a funnel if desired)</p>
      <p>9. Be sure to wipe the lids with a damp cloth to ensure you have a tight seal on the jars</p>
      <p>10. Carefully place the sealed jars back into your large pot of hot water</p>
      <p>11. Bring the pot back to the stove on high heat and let the water boil one last time</p>
      <p>The best part is that you can use the recipe to make all kinds of different soda flavors. I don’t know about you, but I’m totally down for some Mexican Coke jelly.</p>
