      <h1>EU launches ‘infringement’ action over UK refusal to appoint new commissioner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:02:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>The European Commission has launched “infringement proceedings” against Britain after Boris Johnson refused to nominate a new British EU commissioner.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the commission said that it considered that the UK was “in breach of its EU treaty obligations”.</p>
      <p>It said that the Government had until November 22 to respond to the notice.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he would not appoint a new commissioner – even though all member states are legally obliged to do so.</p>
      <p>Incoming commission president Ursula von der Leyen has said she wants to form a new College of Commissioners on December 1.</p>
      <p>But in a letter to the commission on Wednesday, the Government said official pre-election guidance meant it could not make international appointments ahead of polling day on December 12.</p>
