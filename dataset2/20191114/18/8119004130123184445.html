        <b>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina to watch a Test match between India and Bangladesh in Kolkata</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first-ever pink-ball day-night Test between the two nations is scheduled to start on Nov 22 at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Modi formally wrote to Hasina inviting her to attend the inaugural event of the match on Wednesday night, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen told a news conference in Dhaka on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Hasina agreed to attend the event and she would return home the same night, Momen said.</p>
      <p>However, Modi will not be able to attend the event due to his-prescheduled programme, he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Hasina had shown interest to attend the match at the invitation of Sourav Ganguly, now president of India's cricket board.</p>
