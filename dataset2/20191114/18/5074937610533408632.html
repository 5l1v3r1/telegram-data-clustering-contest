      <h1>President must be commended for the proposed amendment of Article 55- Ablekuma Central MCE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:37:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author">Albert Allotey, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA – Madam Mariama Karley Amui, the Municipal Chief Executive for Ablekuma Central, has said the proposed amendment of Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution is a laudable idea and the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo deserves commendation.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is indeed a bold step by His Excellency the President since he is voluntarily giving up his power of appointing Metropolitan, Municipal, District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) and that it is a selfless and visionary gesture that must be applauded.”</p>
      <p>Madam Amui made the commendation when the Assembly held its first town hall meeting at Lartebiokorshie to create awareness on the forthcoming election of assembly members, Unit Committee members and the referendum on the Article 55 clause 3 of the Constitution on December 17, 2019.</p>
      <p>She called on the citizenry to vote ‘Yes’ in the referendum for the amendment of the Article to allow political parties to participate in District Level Elections.</p>
      <p>Madam Amui said the government led by President Akufo-Addo is determined to expand the frontiers of governance and decentralisation and to make the people the drivers and beneficiaries of development.</p>
      <p>“It is for this reason that government desires to involve the people in local governance through the election of MMDCEs,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Chief Executive said the election of MMDCEs by popular vote would increase accountability and also increase the participation of ordinary citizens in local governance, adding “this is ample manifestation of direct democracy.”</p>
      <p>Madam Amui urged the public to go out in their numbers on December 17 to vote for their assembly members, unit committee members as well as the referendum.</p>
      <p>She called on traditional leaders, religious leaders, youth groups, women groups and every individual to become ambassadors of the district level elections and the referendum.</p>
      <p>“Please use your position and influence in society and every opportunity to educate your community on the exercise. We know that with you on board the exercise will be a resounding success for the Ablekuma Central and the entire nation,” she appealed.</p>
      <p>Mr Joseph Addo Boateng, the Ablekuma Central Municipal Director of the Electoral Commission, took the gathering through the process of the referendum, the election of the assembly members and unit committee members.</p>
      <p>He asked the participants to share the education they have acquired with community members, their households, church members and friends for them to become aware of the referendum and the district level elections on December 17.</p>
      <p>Madam Comfort Azalletey, the Ablekuma Central Municipal Director of the National Commission for Civic Education, called on the electorate to come out in their numbers on December 17, to vote because it was their civic right and responsibility to help in the development of the country.</p>
      <p>She said over the years the turnout in assembly elections has been very low because many are unacquainted with the roles and responsibilities of assembly members and the unit committee members in the development of our electoral areas.</p>
