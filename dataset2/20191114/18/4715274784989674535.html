      <p>Against Thailand’s Mono Vampire, San Miguel-Alab Pilipinas will debut a retooled team led by holdovers Lo Domingo and Brandon Rosser with new additions DLSU Green Archer Andrei Caracut, former ABL Finals MVP Jason Brickman, Jeremiah Gray, former Batang Gilas member Jordan Heading, former NU Bulldog bigman Tzaddy Rangel, veteran professional player and former Letran Knight center Aaron Aban and former UST standout Louie Vigil. Serving as world imports for coach Jimmy Alapag’s squad are Adrian Forbes, Khalif Wyatt, and Nick King.</p>
      <p>Aside from Alab and Mono Vampire, eight other teams will send their hardcourt warriors to compete this season: Hong Kong Eastern, Singapore Slingers, Saigon Heat, Macau Black Bears, Formosa Dreamers, Fubon Braves, Westports Malaysia Dragons, and the Wolf Warriors.</p>
      <p>After winning the ABL crown in Season 8 in dramatic fashion, Alab was booted out during the quarterfinals of Season 9. Can Alab recover its moxie and stamp its class once more on an open field for ABL supremacy? Catch all the home games of Alab LIVE on S+A, S+A HD, and iWant while the team’s away games will be broadcast either live or via satellite.</p>
