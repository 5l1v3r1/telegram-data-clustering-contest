      <p>The second instalment of Disney’s much-loved animated film, Frozen, has arrived.</p>
      <p>But how does it shape up in comparison to the first one?</p>

        <b>Here is what you need to know about Frozen II</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cast: it features the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, Alfred Molina, Evan Rachel Wood and Ciaran Hinds. Director credits include Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee.</p>

        <b>What’s the plot?</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to lovable snowman Olaf (voiced by Gad), who is a permafrosted font of wisdom about the natural world, water has memory.</p>
      <p>Considering that audiences who flocked to the original Frozen are largely made of water, it’s safe to assume that their memories of Buck and Lee’s Oscar-winning adventure will ebb and flow throughout this visually stunning sequel to the highest-grossing animated film of all time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Oh no, H2O? Not quite… </b>
      </p>
      <p>Water and the other classical elements – air, earth and fire – play pivotal roles in Frozen II.</p>
      <p>The realistic movement of aqua has always been a chink in the armour of computer animators. Not so here.</p>
      <p>Disney’s platoons of digital wizards repeatedly quench our thirst with jaw-dropping set pieces including a thrilling gallop over crashing waves of an angry sea astride an untamed water horse.</p>

        <b>What about the music?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’ve had six years to commit to memory every note, key change and lyrical flip of Do You Want To Build A Snowman?, For The First Time In Forever, Love Is An Open Door and Let It Go.</p>
      <p>It would be churlish to expect returning songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez to ride the crest of those sound waves again on a first listen.</p>
      <p>In the sequel, Elsa’s call to arms Into The Unknown soars to dizzying high notes and Kristoff’s faux 1990s rock ballad Lost In The Woods is a hoot, replete with four-legged backing singers.</p>
      <p>Anna’s solo The Next Right Thing is a beautifully melancholic distillation of grief.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What lies ahead for Elsa and Anna?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three years have passed since Elsa (voiced by Menzel) ascended the throne of Arendelle.</p>
      <p>An ethereal voice from the enchanted forest beckons her to unlock the secret of a bedtime story told to Elsa and sister Anna (Bell) by their parents, King Agarr (Molina) and Queen Iduna (Wood).</p>
      <p>“The truth must be found. Without it, there is no future,” confirms troll king Grand Pabbie (Hinds).</p>
      <p>Thus, Elsa, Anna, her goofy beau Kristoff (Groff), reindeer Sven and Olaf journey to an ancient stone circle shrouded in swirling mist, which designates a hidden pathway to the supposedly lost Northuldra tribe.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What about Olaf?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inveterate scene-stealer Olaf hysterically recaps the first film in the sequel’s crowd-pleasing showpiece and finds a perfect match for his gosh-darn cuteness in a blue salamander sidekick.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s the verdict?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the first film encouraged characters to let go of things that hurt or hinder – fear, self-doubt, regret, the past – Buck and Lee’s follow-up dives deeper into their tearful self-reflection.</p>
      <p>Menzel and Bell gently tug heartstrings as sisterly bonds strain and their brave heroines make sacrifices to remedy a great injustice.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had my adventure/I don’t need something new,” defiantly trills Elsa.</p>
      <p>Legions of fans do, and, despite its flimsy plot, Frozen II largely delivers.</p>
      <p>Frozen II is released in the UK and Ireland on November 22.</p>
