      <h1>Connor Brown murder trial: Teenager relives the moment his friend fell fatally injured to the ground</h1>
      <h2>Leighton Barrass and Ally Gordon deny murdering Connor Brown in an alleyway in Sunderland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:16:21+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>A teenager told a court of the moment his fatally wounded friend fell to the ground after allegedly being stabbed following a row over £5.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Connor Brown was stabbed five times by Leighton Barrass after an altercation in an alleyway.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court has heard Connor was "brave" in punching Barrass after he threatened to stab people as he looked for revenge for being punched by Stephen Nunn.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that after Barrass stabbed him, Ally Gordon kicked and stamped on Connor.</p>
      <p>Both men deny murdering 18-year-old Connor in Sunderland in February and are standing trial.</p>
      <p>Nr Nunn, who was then 18, told police during a video recorded interview, which was played in court, how he bumped into Connor in Gatsby's bar during the Saturday night out and said he was "happy, having a laugh, enjoying himself".</p>
      <p>Mr Nunn said he and Connor were in a lane behind the bar when they saw Gordon, who he vaguely knew, with Barrass, who was a stranger to him and he described as having a "babyish" face. He said both men looked "high or drunk".</p>
      <p>He told police that he was offered "pills" by the men and refused but when asked if he would swap £10 for two fives, he ended up £5 out of pocket.</p>
      <p>He said Barrass, who "looked off his head or wired" then started to get "rowdy, swearing and stuff".</p>
      <p>Mr Nunn added: "He started coming into my personal space and I punched him because I felt threatened by way he was going on towards me.</p>
      <p>"He wasn't threatening at first but swearing, getting rowdy. The condition he was in made me feel like I was in some sort of threat so I defended myself and I hit him."</p>
      <p>Mr Nunn said he planned to go back towards the bar when he heard someone shouting "he's got a knife".</p>
      <p>He added: "I didn't really think he had a knife with him. Obviously he did.</p>
      <p>"I turned around and there was a massive commotion, like rumble sort of thing, a bunch of people together.</p>
      <p>"I remember seeing Connor's white top and an arm come around and hit him.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if it was a punch or with the blade but at the time I didn't believe he had a knife with him."</p>
      <p>Mr Nunn said his view of exactly what happened was obscured by the movement of people.</p>
      <p>He said he felt like he "froze" during the incident, which lasted "a minute at most, might have been 30 seconds".</p>
      <p>He added: "All I remember, after the commotion separated, was Connor coming towards me and as he got closer I started to see a bit blood on him.</p>
      <p>"It was on his top, he had a white top on, it was easy to notice. As he started to get closer he fell."</p>
      <p>Mr Nunn said he ran to get help from nearby doorstaff when he realised what had happened.</p>
      <p>He added: "I wanted to stay and help him because he's my mate."</p>
      <p>Barrass, 20, of Hartside Square, Sunderland and Gordon, 20, of Polmuir Road, Plains Farm,  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a>, who were allegedly acting as a "team", deny murder.</p>
      <p>Barrass has admitted having a knife in the back alley that night while Gordon denies possessing a different knife on his way to Scotland.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
