      <p>Tarkwa (W/R), Nov. 14, GNA - The Judicial Service Staff in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Constituency have joined their colleagues nationwide to embark on the indefinite strike action over the review of their salaries.</p>
      <p>As at about 1030hours on Wednesday when the Ghana News Agency (GNA) visited the Tarkwa High court, Circuit court, District court one and two no staff, including security personals, had reported to work.</p>
      <p>The various offices and court rooms were locked and the workers hoisted red flags to register their displeasure over the unsettled salary review.</p>
      <p>Some few people the GNA spotted around the Tarkwa Circuit Court and the District Court one and two who had travelled from far for their cases to be heard on Wednesday November 13 had to return home disappointed as there were no staff to attend to them.</p>
      <p>Maame Abena Asantewaa, a mother of three and a petty trader who usually sell around the court premises, said the strike action had affected her sales badly.</p>
      <p>She, therefore, appealed to the government to address all the issues raised by the aggrieved staff so that she could make enough sales to take care of her children who are in school.</p>
