        <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Ghana v South Africa</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 14 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue</b>: Cape Coast Stadium</p>
      <p>Bafana Bafana will kickstart their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers campaign with a trip to Ghana on Thursday evening at Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>The match is scheduled to get underway at 19h00 in Ghana (21h00 South African time).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read:<a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/afcon-1/2021-africa-cup-of-nations-qualifying-wrap-1/667427"> Bucs Star Carries Scoring Form Into AFCON Qualifiers</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>New Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will play his first competitive match as head coach after his charges beat Mali 2-1 in the Nelson Mandela Challenge friendly last month.</p>
      <p>Ntseki has kept the core of the team that reached the quarter-finals of the recently completed Afcon in Egypt under former coach Stuart Baxter and he will rely on that experience to get a positive result in Cape Coast.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Black Stars have not played any matches since their disappointing 2019 Afcon tournament in Egypt, where they were knocked out in the last 16 by Tunisia.</p>
      <p>Their Football Association was troubled by administrative issues, that saw FIFA appoint a committee to run their affairs until new leaders were appointed in the recently completed elections.</p>
      <p>A win for either side by a margin of less than four goals will not be enough to earn top spot in Group C, after Sudan thrashed São Tomé and Principe 4-0 on Wednesday to lead the section.</p>
