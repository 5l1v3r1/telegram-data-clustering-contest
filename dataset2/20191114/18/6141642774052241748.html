      <p>A 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of Syria-related terror offences as he landed on a flight to Heathrow Airport was deported from Turkey over claims he was a member of so-called Islamic State, the PA news agency understands.</p>
      <p>The man, who has not been named, was arrested by the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism command on Thursday as he landed at Heathrow Airport on a flight from Turkey.</p>
      <p>Earlier the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed a Briton was one of several IS suspects deported this week.</p>
      <p>The Home Office refused to confirm the identity of that suspect.</p>
      <p>However, it is understood that the arrested man was, indeed, the deported Briton.</p>

      <p>The arrest is not considered significant, PA understands.</p>
      <p>He remains in custody, although the Home Office said it used various tools to manage the threat of any Briton returning to the UK from Syria, including Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs) notices placing restrictions on that person.</p>
      <p>Turkey has declared its determination to deport alleged foreign IS members who are held in its prisons or in parts of Syria it controls.</p>
      <p>That came after Ankara was condemned by some western governments for sending forces to parts of north-east Syria to drive out Kurdish fighters it considers to be terrorists even though they were allies in the US-led push to defeat IS in the region.</p>
      <p>Turkey has already deported a US national and IS suspect – named in reports as Muhammed Darwis B, who is said to be a US citizen of Jordanian descent – who was stuck in a no-man’s land between Turkey and Greece after Athens refused him entry.</p>
      <p>Ankara said the United States had agreed to take him back.</p>
      <p>It was reported that Ankara also plans to deport other alleged IS members, including two Irish and 11 French citizens in the near future.</p>
      <p>Last month it was confirmed two suspected IS terrorists, dubbed The Beatles because of their accents, had been taken from Syria into American custody.</p>
      <p>Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, both in their 30s, were moved by American security services to an “undisclosed location” amid fears they could escape custody as Turkish troops invaded the Syrian Kurdish-held region of north-eastern Syria.</p>
      <p>They were described as “the worst of the worst” by US president Donald Trump.</p>

      <p>In August, Mr Javid also stripped 24-year-old “Jihadi” Jack Letts of his British citizenship.</p>
      <p>The convert was 18 when he left his Oxfordshire home to join IS in Syria in 2014.</p>
