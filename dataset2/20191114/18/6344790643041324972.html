      <p><b>James Wan </b>and <b>Leigh Whannell</b>’s <b><i>Insidious</i></b> horror franchise has been a lot of fun to watch. I’ve enjoyed the films that have been made, and if you have as well, you’ll be happy to learn that there’s another sequel in development.</p>
      <p>The news comes from franchise star<b> Lin Shaye</b>, and she tells <a href="https://dailydead.com/interview-lin-shaye-discusses-gothic-harvest-the-grudge-ambition-penny-dreadful-city-of-angels-and-the-possibility-of-another-insidious-movie/">Daily Dead</a> in an interview:</p>
      <blockquote>"I've heard rumblings. There's no script as far as I know.[With] Elise, <i>The Last Key</i> pretty much completed my story as a character. I'm now in The Further. There's no more prequels. Everybody knows more about me than I knew. I kind of have an idea what the story might be about, and that I don't feel comfortable talking about, because nothing has been brought out into the open. But as far as I've heard, there will be another one. And it'll be sort of a different setup in a way, of some of the same characters from a couple of the past episodes, too."</blockquote>
      <p>She went on to explain:</p>
      <blockquote>"It's an exciting idea that I've heard, but I don't have any information about it. There's no script as far as I know yet. And there's been no date in terms of beginning photography or anything. It'll probably be in the next year or so, because Blumhouse is a little busy, as we all know. But I've got my fingers crossed there will be one more, I hope."</blockquote>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to what the creative team is planning for the next I<i>nsidious</i> film. One of the things that I like most about this franchise is how the films cleverly and uniquely connect with each other as the story has jumped forward and backward through time.</p>
      <p>Have you enjoyed the Insidious films and are you happy to learn that there’s another sequel in the works?</p>
