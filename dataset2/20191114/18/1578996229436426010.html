      <h1>Charm La’Donna Is the Choreographer Behind the World’s Biggest Pop Stars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:39:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Ariana Yaptangco</a></address>
      <p>Two weeks ago, in the middle of the night, Selena Gomez surprised fans with a new single. "Look at Her Now" was met with usual fanfare⁠—a video shot on Apple's new iPhone 11, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29553902/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/">rampant speculation</a> that the song is a kiss-off to ex Justin Bieber⁠—but the real buzz surrounds the video's choreography. Gomez, clad in a sparkly silver dress, shakes and shimmies with a girl squad of dancers. They whip their long braided ponytails, and their hand movements, quick and intricate, are mesmerizing. Twitter was inspired.</p>
      <p>You may not know Charm La'Donna, the choreographer and mastermind behind "Look at Her Now," but you've seen her work. Born and raised in California, the dancer and creative director has worked with Gomez for years, along with a slew of diverse megastars. Dua Lipa's most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHQ0F2Aa7Oc">MTV EMA performance</a>? Charm choreographed it. Rosalía's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1r9An6haVS/?hl=en">all-Spanish tour</a>? Charm again. Kendrick Lamar's critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFwtA3p4Mw">2018 Grammy's performance</a>? Yup, that was Charm too.</p>
      <p>No La'Donna production is the same. "I tap into something different for every artist because every artist is different, and I think that's why all my performances are so different," La'Donna told ELLE.com during a break from rehearsals in LA. "[People wonder], 'How can she choreograph Kendrick, and then choreograph Dua, and then choreograph for Selena, and then choreograph Meghan Trainor?' It's because I tap into those creative spaces with my artists."</p>
      <p>Ahead, La'Donna talks her accomplished career path, creative process, and what it's like to collaborate with the world's biggest pop stars.</p>

      <h3>Everybody’s obsessed with Selena Gomez’s "Look At Her Now" music video and even more recently, Dua Lipa's EMA performance. Can you talk about your process when choreographing something of that scale?</h3>
      <p>To be honest, my process changes every time. It depends on the performance. It depends on the music. It depends on the artist and what the overall creative is. I never plan. This is one thing that stays the same: I go into the room, and I create in the space while I'm there. I don't pre-plan anything.</p>
      <h3>A standout from the "Look At Her Now" music video is the intricate hand movements. Where did that come from?</h3>
      <p>To be honest, it was listening to Selena go, "Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm." It makes you want to move your hands. And then, in the space with her, we just started moving in that way, and then it came. Doesn't it sound like she's like, "Mm, mm," telling someone off in it? The music drove that a lot.</p>

      <h3>If we're looking at a Selena or a Dua, how much does the artist themselves inform the choreography, versus the music?</h3>
      <p>Well, I think both go hand-in-hand, because the artist is so close to the music, and it's what they created, right? It almost is a piece of them. So, when I choreograph, I am just fortunate enough to be able to know and be friends with the artists that I work with. So, I know them, and I get to know them, in a way. That inspires me to pull the moves out and in the space. I don't prepare anything to bring to them because I want it to be organic to who they are.</p>
      <h3>Is that a scenario where you go into a dance studio with the artist? Or do you start off by yourself?</h3>
      <p>I start it by myself when they send me the track. Most of the time, if not every time, I get the music before the audience gets the music, so that I can live with it and interpret it how I will.</p>

      <h3>How did you first get into dance?</h3>
      <p>I was three years old. My mom put me in a recreational dance studio, and the teacher there actually told my mom to put me in a proper dance studio. I told her, "I want to dance. I want to entertain. I want to be a performer."</p>
      <h3>What artists did you look up to growing up? Anyone’s music videos you watched and tried to create in your living room?</h3>
      <p>I was a big fan of Fatima Robinson, and all the Aaliyah videos that she choreographed, and Missy Elliot and Britney Spears videos. I would try to learn and do on my own, and then it kind of led me to choreographing at a very young age, putting dance moves together for talent shows, or for my friends. It grew from there.</p>

      <h3>Do you have any advice for aspiring dancers and choreographers?</h3>
      <p>One distinctive thing that I would always do when I would try to learn dance moves, or look at dance videos, or look at award shows, [is] I would see myself there. I think that's a big part of manifesting who I am. I've always seen and known what I wanted, and gone for it, and worked really hard to get it, and haven't allowed anything or anyone to stop me in my path and what I believe. I would just tell dancers and aspiring choreographers to use any platform they have, and to push themselves, and to believe in themselves first, because we are an innovative community.</p>
      <h3>Is there a industry you haven't worked in yet that you want to break into?</h3>
      <p>I've tapped into film and television, but I really want to dive in. Of course, Broadway I would love [to do]. I just choreographed a piece for theatrical company, which I'm super excited about.</p>
      <p>What I'm really excited about is using everything I've learned in the industry, learned from the artists that I've worked with—choreographed and directed—and creating my own visual for myself that I'm going to be doing next year. It's really putting it all in a pot and showing my visuals, in a way, with collaborations with my friends. That's what I'm really looking forward to.</p>
