      <h1>Pakistan's envoy elected to head UN convention on conventional weapons</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:14:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>In an endorsement of Pakistan’s strong credentials in multilateral diplomacy, the country’s permanent envoy to the United Nations in Geneva  Khalil Hashmi has been elected as the chairperson of the annual meeting of states parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW).</p>
      <p>“Pakistan’s unanimous election reflects recognition by the international community of the country’s longstanding contribution to promote international security through arms control instruments,” said an official statement issued on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The CCW represents an important arms control framework that envisages prohibitions and restrictions on certain conventional weapons that can cause unnecessary suffering to combatants or affect civilians indiscriminately,” it added.</p>
      <p>After his election to the UN post, Khalil Hashmi took to Twitter, saying: “Great honour for having been elected today [Wednesday] in Geneva as chairman of the 2019 Annual Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). Imp[ortant] issues including autonomous weapons and financial aspects of the Convention under consideration.”</p>

      <p>The convention and its five protocols strike a prudent balance between humanitarian concerns and legitimate military utility of certain categories of conventional weapons, the communique said.</p>
      <p>The states’ parties meet annually to review the implementation of the convention as well as to explore the possibility of developing additional protocols on new weapon systems of concern.</p>
      <p>“This year’s annual meeting will address several important issues including the role of autonomous weapons and the financial sustainability of the Convention.”</p>
