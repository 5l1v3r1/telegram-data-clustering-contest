      <h1>Sekyere East GES engages public on school enrolment campaign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:09:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author">Gideon D. Ebbah, GNA   </a></address>
      <p>Effiduase (Ash), Nov. 14, GNA – The Sekyere East District Directorate of the Ghana Education Service (GES) has held its turn of “the Right Age Enrollment (RAE)” campaign.</p>
      <p>This is a national public sensitization exercise rolled out by the GES to help enroll in school, all children of school going age.</p>
      <p>The RAE is in line with an all-inclusive national educational drive being rolled out to ensure that no child is left behind in the nation’s effort to mobilize human resources for accelerated development.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a town hall meeting at Effiduase, Madam Vida Barbara Ntow, the Early Childhood Coordinator at the GES Headquarters, said the meeting is aimed at engaging all parents and stakeholders to impress upon them the need to enroll their children who have turned age four at the pre-school level.</p>
      <p>She told the meeting attended by parents and other stakeholders that the RAE aims at ensuring that all children in that age bracket are enrolled at Kindergarten (KG) level, where a systematic educational approach, geared at sustaining the children’s interest in school, is applied.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the RAE would also help in the early detection of children with learning difficulties to enable such children receive the appropriate professional intervention and support to ensure that they go through formal education without any hindrance.</p>
      <p>Again, she said, early enrollment amongst KG children has enabled the children to gain the requisite cognitive, social, physical and learning skills necessary to migrate to Primary One and further.</p>
      <p>She said the main challenge facing Ghana’s Kindergarten education is not exclusion or dropout, but the problem had to do with the mixture of both over or under-aged children sitting in pre-school classrooms.</p>
      <p>The other challenge, she said, was children of school going age who are not in school, .</p>
      <p>“Since the Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education (FCUBE) of the government was enabling free and universal access to basic education, there is no excuse for parents especially those in the rural and poverty-prone areas of the urban centers to enroll their children at the right age of 4”.</p>
      <p>Madam Mary Boatemaa Marfo, the District Chief Executive (DCE) said it is necessary for all parents to consider and partake in the RAE campaign since education empowers individuals from their childhood to matured stage.</p>
      <p>Mr David Oppong, the Sekyere East GES District Director, called for strong coordination between the GES district directorates and the department of Social Welfare in terms of enhancing and sustaining monitoring and evaluations on the National Policy of compulsory enrolment of children at age four in the KG1.</p>
      <p>The Reverend Father Peter Brenyah, the Priest of the Effiduase Catholic Church and the Local Manager of the Catholic schools, urged the GES to collaborate with the District Assembly in engaging the relevant stakeholders in finding sustainable solutions to challenges in the primary education sector.</p>
