      <p>"There are other mechanisms if someone wants to drop their baby off and they make that choice," Merriman said.</p>

      <h3>Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said he will meet with a Saskatoon organization planning to launch a drop-off site for abandoned babies after the discovery of a deceased infant in a downtown recycling bin last week, but declined to say if he supports the project.</h3>
      <p>Sanctum Care Group executive director Katelyn Roberts told Postmedia on Tuesday that her organization would move ahead with installing an “angel’s cradle” where a baby can be safely and anonymously abandoned.</p>

      <p>The project was put on hold last October when the ministry announced more review was needed.</p>
      <p>“We do feel that the tragedy that did unfold demonstrates a real need to push this along in a more efficient way,” Roberts said.</p>
      <p>Merriman sidestepped questions from reporters on Wednesday about whether a cradle is needed, saying he prefers parents follow normal adoption procedures or access existing services.</p>
      <p>“There are other mechanisms if someone wants to drop their baby off and they make that choice,” Merriman said.</p>

      <p>Merriman stressed several times that a cradle may not necessarily have saved the baby’s life.</p>
      <p>Roberts said the same on Tuesday, but argued the option is worthwhile even if it only saves one life.</p>
      <p>Merriman said the ministry met with 85 community organizations in Saskatoon this year and not all agreed a cradle was needed. He said the Saskatoon Tribal Council pointed out that some children would not be able to connect with their home community, for example.</p>
      <p>The ministry resolved to focus on “the prevention side of things,” and earmarked an additional $1.2 million for those efforts, Merriman said.</p>
      <p>“At that time, a decision was made to make sure we were on the proactive side of things — to make sure we didn’t get to the point where an angel’s cradle would have to be used.”</p>

      <p>Saskatchewan does not have “safe-haven” legislation exempting people from criminal charges for voluntarily abandoning a child. There is no immediate plan to pass one. Merriman declined to answer a question about whether Sanctum’s funding would be affected if it proceeded with installing the cradle without the ministry’s blessing, calling it a “‘what if’ scenario.”</p>
      <p>Roberts said the organization hopes to work with the ministry on the initiative.</p>
      <p>EGADZ executive director Don Meikle, whose organization works with young mothers in Saskatoon, said it’s time to “expedite” a conversation on safe-haven laws and an angel’s cradle.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t something for two or three years down the road. This is something for now,” Meikle said.</p>
      <p>If a cradle is installed, it should be at a well-known location such as a hospital, like existing cradles in Vancouver and Edmonton, he suggested, adding that any plan should also consider the health and care of the mother or parent.</p>
      <p>“I think we owe it to the baby and the mum to find out what the heck happened,” Meikle said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/autopsy-scheduled-as-investigation-continues-into-body-of-infant-found-in-saskatoon-recycling-bin">An autopsy was performed on the infant’s body on Tuesday</a>. Merriman said the coroner’s report will be available in about four months.</p>
