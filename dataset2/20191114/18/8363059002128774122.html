      <h1>Google Trials A 'Clear' Button For Search</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:00:57+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tegan Jones</a></address>
      <p>Google has begun trialling a 'clear' button in search that will allow users to move onto a new query without having to manually delete their current text.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/12/google-search-clear-text-desktop/">9ToGoogle</a>, this experiment seems to be restricted to only some Google accounts. It's currently unclear if any Australian users are part of the UI trial.</p>
      <p>Anyone who does get a chance to use it will see a rectangle 'clear' button on the far right of the main search box. It doesn't appear to currently be working with most other result tabs such as 'news'.</p>
      <p>It's not a huge change, but if rolled out properly it would be a nifty little feature that will certainly help save some search time. [<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/12/google-search-clear-text-desktop/">9To5Google</a>]</p>
