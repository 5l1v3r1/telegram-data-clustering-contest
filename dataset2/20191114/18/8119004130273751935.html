        <b>BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has appealed to the Supreme Court challenging a High Court order that turned down her bail plea in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kayser Kamal, a lawyer for Khaleda, confirmed the development on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Appellate Chamber is expected to hear the petition next week, he said.</p>
      <p>The High Court on July 31 rejected Khaleda’s bail petition in the case.</p>

      <p>On Oct 29 last year a special court in Dhaka sentenced Khaleda to seven years in prison in the case dubbed “false” by the BNP.</p>
      <p>The former prime minister was transferred to the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital on Apr 1 this year for treatment from the old jailhouse on Nazim Uddin Road.</p>
      <p>She has been in prison since February last year serving 17 year jail in the Zia Orphanage and Zia Charitable Trust corruption cases.</p>
