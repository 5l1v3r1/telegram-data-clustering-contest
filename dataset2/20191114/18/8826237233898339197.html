      <h1>Jeffrey Epstein Estate Seeks to Create Fund to Compensate Accusers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:55:08+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(NEW YORK) â€” Lawyers for the estate of Jeffrey Epstein want to set up a fund to compensate women who have accused him of sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>The estate filed papers Thursday in the U.S. Virgin Islands asking a court there to approve the voluntary claims program.</p>
      <p>They say that it would be managed by Kenneth Feinberg, a mediator known for administering payouts in other high-profile civil cases.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old Epstein killed himself in his New York City prison cell in August after he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The wealthy financier had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing girls as young as 14 and young women in New York and Florida in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Feinberg said that if the fund is approved, the accusers could begin receiving payments early next year.</p>
