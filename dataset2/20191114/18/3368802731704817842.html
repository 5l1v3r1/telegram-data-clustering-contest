      <p>The government yesterday urged the media to properly verify facts before publishing news on sensitive issues.</p>
      <p>A public notice issued by the home ministry said, “The publication of misleading news on important personalities, politicians, businessmen, government officials and institutions are being noticed occasionally in print, electronic, online, and social media.”</p>
      <p>This is deteriorating public discipline, tarnishing personal reputation, creating social unrest and confusions in people’s mind, the notice read.</p>
      <p>The government relies heavily on the mass media’s positive role in preventing deterioration of public discipline and social unrest, it mentioned.</p>
      <p>In view of this, the media is requested to publish objective and informative news after verifying facts accurately on such sensitive issues, it added.</p>
