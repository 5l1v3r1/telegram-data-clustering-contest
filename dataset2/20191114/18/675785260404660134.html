      <h1>Benefit scandal so bad new mums are going without food for babies</h1>
      <h2>Mothers-to-be and new mums are entitled to payments for up to 39 weeks from 11 weeks before their baby is due, or later if they choose to work for longer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:56:31+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Ros Wynne Jones, https://www.facebook.com/roswynnejoneswriting/</a></address>
      <p>Ever since Iain Duncan Smith set about “reforming” the welfare system with a scythe under the Coalition Government, our social security net has been a disaster.</p>
      <p>The Bedroom Tax. Cuts to Personal Independence Payments relied upon by disabled people. The universal misery of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> .</p>
      <p>Now, even those benefits which haven’t been cut and aren’t Universal Credit are descending into disarray and chaos. And, even those applying for one of the most vital benefits of all, Maternity Allowance, are now facing lengthy delays.</p>
      <p>The benefit particularly supports gig-economy mums – agency workers, and those on temporary contracts or who are self-employed. The backlog is leaving families with an agonising wait for much-needed support at a vulnerable time. It is pushing some over the breadline into poverty, and forcing others to leave their babies to go back to work.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, women who claim Universal Credit are left facing further problems because Maternity Allowance is treated as unearned income.</p>
      <p>Amy Downes, a self-employed social media manager, has received no support since the birth of her second son James 12 weeks ago, leaving her family struggling on her teacher husband’s salary. This has meant she has had to take on work.</p>
      <p>After an 11-week wait, the DWP finally contacted Amy, only to tell her she would get £27 a week, when in fact she was entitled to £150. She is now going through an appeal process with the DWP.</p>
      <p>“Maternity Allowance is a massive support, especially in the early months after having a baby, when you don’t get any income from being self-employed,” Amy says. “I had £100 left over from my last invoice before I went on maternity leave and I am now trying to make this stretch, and I am having to work.</p>
      <p>“It is just added stress. I was diagnosed with postnatal depression when I had my first child and one of the triggers for my anxiety is financial worries. I can’t do things like go to baby massage classes or any baby groups, we have to stay at home all day.</p>
      <p>“When I ring the DWP, I am usually on hold for 40 minutes and I keep getting told there will be a 14-week delay.”</p>
      <p>Mothers-to-be and new mums are entitled to payments for up to 39 weeks from 11 weeks before their baby is due, or later if they choose to work for longer. But the Government is dealing with a backlog of claims.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Amy is making cutbacks on her wedding plans and Christmas. “I’m relying on credit cards and overdrafts.”</p>
      <p>She knows she is one of the luckier ones. “From talking to other mums in similar ­situations, I know they are going to foodbanks and some are going without meals, so they can provide for their babies,” Amy says.</p>
      <p>While Labour has pledged to overhaul ­statutory maternity pay, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> MP Hannah Bardell and Independent MP Frank Field have raised questions in Parliament over the growing scandal. “Women who are due to have babies are going to be left in poverty because of this Government’s mismanagement,” Bardell told Parliament.</p>

      <p>Single parent Emma Seed, 32, waited almost two months for her Maternity Allowance payment. A seasonal worker at a holiday resort in Malton, North Yorks, the delays have left her with rent arrears and long-term financial problems. “I am now torn as to whether I should go back to work, but this will mean I have to stop breastfeeding and find someone to look after Olive,” she says.</p>
      <p>Jade Mackay, who gave birth to her second child Benjamin in August, was left waiting three months for her money, which meant she fell behind with her rent. “Benjamin was a poorly baby, so I spent three weeks in and out of ­Bradford and ­Pinderfields hospital in Wakefield,” she says. “I had to pay for parking, food and extra petrol.”</p>
      <p>Jade’s job ended in August, so the family are now relying on her partner’s income of £1,200 a month. The 27-year-old, from Wakefield, said: “The length of time I have waited is ­ridiculous. We have been living on the breadline bordering on poverty.</p>
      <p>“I applied for Maternity Allowance in July and I was told on the last week of October it would be paid within five to 10 working days.</p>
      <p>“I have since received my back payments on October 31 and I was told from November 6 I’d be paid every two weeks, but we haven’t had another payment from them. I am meant to be getting £147.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had to borrow from family to make sure we could keep our heads above water. We’ve had to choose between paying rent or gas and ­electric and buying discounted foods.”</p>
      <p>A DWP spokesman said: “We ­understand how important this ­financial support is for new parents and are sorry for the delays some are currently experiencing. We are putting more staff in place to speed up the process and we are fast-tracking ­emergency cases.</p>
      <p>“Average waiting times have fallen in recent weeks and we are continuing to reduce them further. You can apply 14 weeks before the week in which your baby is born so we urge people to apply as soon as they are eligible. All payments will be backdated to the date when someone becomes eligible."</p>
