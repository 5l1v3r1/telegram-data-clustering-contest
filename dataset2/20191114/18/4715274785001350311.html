      <p>If the finals were today, the public wouldn’t mind if any contender in the Top 12 of GMA Network’s reality singing tilt, The Clash, was declared winner. It’s like you can randomly pick one of the finalists and call him or her the ultimate winner and nobody would contest the results.</p>
      <p>After a series of dramatic eliminations and surprising twists, The Clash has finally introduced its Top 12 Finalists to the members of the entertainment press early this week. </p>

      <p>During the event, where program hosts Julie Ann San Jose and Rayver Cruz, rendered a duet of the “Best Part,” each finalist performed a two-minute song number to impress the scribes.</p>
      <p>“Walang tapon,” a member of the audience commented after hearing the last finalist to perform.</p>
      <p>Based on what we have seen and heard during the event, GMA Network has chosen a dynamic crop of young and talented singers who are ready to be recording stars. They are: Al Fritz (Cavite); Aljon Gutierrez (Oriental Mindoro); Antonette Tismo (Parañaque); Clark Serration (Cebu); Janina Gonzales (Parañaque); Jeniffer Maravilla (Malabon); Jeremiah Tiangco (Cavite); Lorraine Galvez (La Union); Nef Medina (Cavite); Sassa Dagdag (Pampanga); Thea Astley (Qatar); and Tombi Romulo (Cavite).</p>
      <p> The finalists have been battling it out for weeks, but The Clash Panel—composed of Asia’s Nightingale Lani Misalucha, Asia’s Romantic Balladeer Christian Bautista, and Comedy Concert Queen Ai Ai delas Alas—are looking forward to fiercer musical face-offs as the competition progresses.</p>
      <p>“It’s actually very exciting because now that the competition is becoming more intense, even viewers are having a hard time choosing among the Clashers. All of them are very determined to win and they have what it takes, we can see that. So we’re looking forward to seeing a lot more from them,” shared Lani.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a good set of Top 12 Finalists. All of them are very talented and we’ve seen them give outstanding performances, but at the end of the day, this is a competition and they have to show us more to make it all the way to the end,” said Christian.</p>
      <p> For AiAi, this is the beginning of their ‘real’ fight, “Exciting lalo ang show dahil eto na ‘yung totoong laban. Habang kumokonti sila, dapat mas ibigay pa nila ‘yungbest nila. Tsaka marami pa silang twists na aabangan, pati viewers natin, kaya ‘wag silang bibitaw sa The Clash.”</p>
      <p> The Clash also has Rita Daniela and Ken Chan as journey hosts.</p>
      <p>Under the helm of Director Louie Ignacio, follow the journey of each Clasher every Saturday after Daddy’s Gurl and every Sunday after Daig Kayo Ng Lola Ko on GMA-7.</p>
