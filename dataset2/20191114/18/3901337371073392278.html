      <p>Brazil legend Pele, widely regarded as one of football's greatest players ever, has picked one of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo as the player he wishes he could have played alongside during his career.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Click through the gallery above images of Messi, Neymar and Ronaldo, one of whom Pele wishes to have played with.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Pele spoke to <i>La Gazzetta dello Sport</i> in a recent interview, during which he discussed his deteriorating health, revealed his toughest opponent and picked a modern-day great as the one player he wishes he could have played alongside.</p>
      <p>The 79-year-old was asked to name one footballer playing in 2019 he would have loved to have played with during his own career, and picked FC Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo and countryman Neymar.</p>
      <p>"I think Leo Messi," Pele answered. </p>
      <p>"He is a skilled player, gives assists, passes, scores, dribbles well. If we were in a team together, the opponents would have to worry about two players, not just one!</p>
      <p>"Today, Messi is the most complete player."</p>

      <p>Pele also claimed that the aforementioned trio were the only players who could be considered modern-day greats, whereas in his era there were players from every country who were at that level. </p>
      <p>"Once, you found two or three in every country with a great football culture," the former Santos superstar added. </p>
      <p>"Eusebio, (Antonio) Simoes, (Johan) Cruyff, (Franz) Beckenbauer, (Diego) Maradona, Garrincha, Didi. How many did I say? There were so many.</p>
      <p>"Today, we have two or three in total. Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, I would say Neymar, who in Brazil has not yet managed to become a great figure."</p>

      </p>
      <p>The three-time FIFA World Cup winner remains Brazil's all-time leading goalscorer with 77 strikes to his name in 92 international appearances, and is also the most prolific goalscorer at club level in football's history.</p>
