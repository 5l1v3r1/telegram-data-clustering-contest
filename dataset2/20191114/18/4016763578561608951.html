      <h1>Migos Win Copyright Battle Over “Walk It Talk It”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:28:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/migos">Migos</a> just won a copyright infringement lawsuit over their <a href="https://genius.com/artists/drake">Drake</a>-assisted <a href="https://genius.com/Migos-walk-it-talk-it-lyrics">“Walk It Talk It.”</a></p>
      <p>Last October, a North Carolina rapper filed a complaint against the Atlanta trio, claiming that the 2018 hit infringed on the copyright of a 2007 record called “Walk It Like I Talk It.” U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres dismissed the complaint this week.</p>
      <p>In legal documents obtained by <i><a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/migos-win-walk-it-talk-it-copyright-infringement-lawsuit">Complex</a></i>, Torres ruled that the plaintiff Leander Pickett (aka M.O.S.) had no case because the phrase “walk it like I talk it” is too common for copyright protection. The judge pointed to rap songs with similar lyrics: <a href="https://genius.com/artists/jeezy">Jeezy</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Jeezy-3-am-lyrics">“3 A.M.,”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/artists/paul-wall">Paul Wall</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Paul-wall-march-n-step-lyrics">“March N’ Step,”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/wiz-khalifa">Wiz Khalifa</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Wiz-khalifa-be-easy-lyrics">“Be Easy.”</a></p>
      <p>“Because songwriters must be free to borrow sayings and expressions from popular culture, the Second Circuit and courts in this district have found that short and commonplace phrases are not protectable, even when used as the title or repeated lyrics of a song, as is the case here,” Torres said. “The only similarity between the two works at issue, the lyrics ‘walk it like I talk it,’ is not original to the author and is, therefore, not protected by the copyright laws.”</p>
      <p>The Migos cut is centered around the titular hook:</p>
      <blockquote>Walk it like I talk it (walk it)<br/>Walk it like I talk it<br/>Walk it, walk it like I talk it (woo)<br/>Walk it like I talk it (yeah)</blockquote>
      <p>M.O.S. uses a similar cadence in his version of the hook:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, he didn’t attempt to copyright his song until March 2018, a few months after Migos dropped their track. Torres noted that Pickett failed to properly register the copyright for his work.</p>
      <p>“The only meaningful similarity between Plaintiff’s Work and Defendant’s Work is that the lyrics ‘walk it like I talk it’ form each song’s chorus, or hook,” the decision said, according to <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and-management/8543550/migos-walk-it-talk-it-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed">Billboard</a></i>. “Having carefully listened to the two songs, the Court concludes that the similarity between the two works concerns only ‘unprotectible elements’ of Plaintiff’s Work.”</p>
      <p>Migos’ co-defendants include Capitol Records, Quality Control Music, and producers <a href="https://genius.com/artists/og-parker">OG Parker</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/deko">Deko</a>. The plaintiff’s lawyer Dana Whitfield told <i>Billboard</i> that the rapper’s legal team is “exploring options for an appeal.”</p>
      <p>Most recently, the hip-hop group <a href="https://genius.com/a/travis-scott-migos-young-thug-debut-new-collaboration-at-astroworld-festival">debuted a new collaboration</a> with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/travis-scott">Travis Scott</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/young-thug">Young Thug</a> at the Astroworld Festival.</p>
