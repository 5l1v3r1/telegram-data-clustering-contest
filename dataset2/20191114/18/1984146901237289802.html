      <p>Three suspected thieves have been arrested after a shop worker was threatened with a knife in broad daylight.</p>
      <p>At about 11.10am on Wednesday police received a call that two men had attempted to steal a bike from outside a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> furniture shop.</p>
      <p>The thieves had allegedly been attempting to steal a silver Suzuki SV1000 from outside Delcor Furniture on Double Row in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/seaton-delaval">Seaton Deleval.</a></p>
      <p>They were confronted by a brave staff member but the culprits then brandished a knife and threatened to stab him.</p>
      <p>The men then attempted to make off with the bike but abandoned it a short distance away after again being challenged by the staff member, and a second man who owned the bike.</p>
      <p>Police were called and were able to identify three suspects who were arrested and remain in police custody.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Detective Inspector</a> Tam Fowler, who oversees the Operation Benelli team, praised the bravery of the members of the public.</p>
      <p>He said: “This would have been a terrifying incident for the two men who confronted the men who were trying to steal the bike.</p>
      <p>“There actions have allowed us to respond quickly to make these arrests while we were also able to seize a suspected stolen bike from a nearby address.</p>
      <p>“I want to praise the men for the courage they have shown and I hope our quick response shows them how serious we take this offending.</p>
      <p>“It is completely unacceptable to steal someone else’s property but it is also very concerning that these offenders were carrying a knife.</p>
      <p>“We need the public to work with us and if they see people acting suspiciously in their community then please give us a call.</p>
      <p>“It was a fantastic piece of work by both our Op Benelli team and response officers in the area and our CID detectives will now take on this investigation.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The three men arrested – aged 21, 19, and 17 – remain in police custody at this time.</b>
