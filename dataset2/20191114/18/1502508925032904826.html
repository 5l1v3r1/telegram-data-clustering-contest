      <h1>In October, India's diesel demand fell at steepest annual rate in 3 years</h1>
      <h2>Sales of gasoline, or petrol, rose 8.9% in October from a year earlier, to 2.54 million tonnes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:20:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>India's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/diesel">diesel </a>demand in October fell at its steepest annual rate in nearly three years, provisional government data showed, reflecting subdued industrial and economic activity during the month.</p>
      <p>Local sales of diesel, which accounts for about two-fifths of overall fuel consumption, slipped 7.4% year-on-year to 6.51 million tonnes. The annual decline was the most since January 2017, according to data posted on the website of Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.</p>
      <p>Demand for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/diesel">diesel </a>in the world's third biggest oil importer is seen as a measure of industrial vibrancy as it is used, for example, to fuel trucks transporting goods across the country.</p>
      <p>Declining <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/diesel">diesel </a>consumption is forcing refiners to export the fuel, adding to abundant supplies in Asia and weighing on refining margins for 10ppm gasoil. A fall in auto sales over the last year in tandem with a shift by motorists to gasoline powered vehicles, has also contributed to the fall in diesel consumption.</p>
      <p>Sales of gasoline, or petrol, rose 8.9% in October from a year earlier, to 2.54 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>However, demand for diesel is expected to recover in the next six months as the longer-than-usual monsoon season that affected transportation and industry has ended, the chairman of top domestic refiner Indian Oil Corp said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Slowing economic and industrial activity has already led some global agencies to cut their Indian <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fuel-demand">fuel demand </a>forecasts.</p>
      <p>The International Energy Agency expects oil consumption growth to drop to 170,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, the slowest since 2014. Asia's third-largest economy expanded by just 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace since 2013, and the International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for this fiscal year.</p>
      <p>"We don't see a significant revival in (GDP growth) for some time. No doubt, the slowdown in consumption has weighed on diesel too," said Jigar Trivedi, a commodities analyst at Mumbai-based Anand Rathi Shares &amp; Stock Brokers.</p>
      <p>Overall refined fuels consumption, a proxy for oil demand, fell 1.4% to 17.41 million tonnes on an annual basis in October, the steepest decline since June.</p>
      <p>In April-October 2019, the first seven months of this fiscal year, India's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fuel-demand">fuel demand </a>grew by 1% from a year ago, the data showed.</p>
      <p>Growth in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fuel-demand">fuel demand </a>in India is on course to fall to its lowest in at least six years as the economy slows and after heavy rains impacted gasoil consumption.</p>
      <p>Fuel demand fell to its lowest in a year in September, revised data shows.</p>
