      <h2>Laura Pidcock leads Labour's campaigning as the party focuses on equality and employment rights</h2>

      <p>Employers will face fines unless they "take satisfactory measures to close the pay gap" under a Labour government, North West Durham candidate Laura Pidcock has announced.</p>
      <p>She took centre-stage in Labour's general election campaign, in her role as Shadow Employment Rights Secretary. If Labour wins the December 12 general election then she is expected to lead a new ministry of labour.</p>
      <p>Next year marks 50 years since the Equal Pay Act, but on average women in full-time work still earn 13.1% less than men. According to pressure group the Fawcett Society, the pay gap will take another 60 years to close.</p>
      <p>Launching Labour's plans alongside Dawn Butler, the Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary, she said Labour will close the gender pay gap by creating a new "Workers’ Protection Agency" with powers to fine organisations that fail to report their gender pay, publish action plans to reduce pay gaps or take satisfactory measures to close the pay gap.</p>
      <p>Firms with more than 250 staff will also face fines if they fail to obtain "government certification on gender equality". By the end of 2020, a Labour government would lower the threshold to workplaces with 50 employees, while providing additional support for small business. </p>

      <p>Female employees would be entitled to statutory maternity pay for 12 months, up from nine months now.</p>
      <p>And there will be "national pay scales" in low paid sectors with overwhelmingly female workforces, such as childcare and school support staff.</p>
      <p>Large employers will also be required to introduce a menopause workplace policy, to break the stigma associated with the menopause.</p>
      <p>Ms Pidcock said: "For far too long the interests of working women have been at the bottom of the list of priorities for government.</p>
      <p>"Labour in government will be uncompromising in tackling the structural barriers that is holding so many women back.</p>
      <p>"Employers will no longer be able to treat the issue of the gender pay gap as an afterthought. Instead, they will be expected to take proactive steps to close it.</p>
      <p>"Labour will deliver the real change that women need in the workplace.”</p>
      <p>The Fawcett Society's research suggests the pay gap is not simply a result of men being paid more than women to do the same job, although this does happen. It also reflects the fact that women are more likely to be in low paid and low skilled jobs, and are more likely to be caring for children or elderly relatives.</p>
      <p>It says that the solutions involve advertising all jobs as flexible, part-time or a job share, unless there is a strong business case not to, and improving childcare provision.</p>
      <p>Ms Pidcock was later asked about Labour's policy on immigration, after Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite trade union spoke out against freedom of movement. Labour's annual conference this voted for a policy to "maintain and extend” free movement for EU citizens, but Mr McCluskey said this was not a sensible approach.</p>
      <p>Leaving the European Union would allow the UK to end freedom of movement but would not force it to. A policy of ending freedom of movement would mean Labour taking a far tougher anti-immigrant line than under previous leaders such as Ed Miliband or Tony Blair.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Radio 4's Today Programme, Ms Pidcock said: "We know actually that migrant labour does not undercut wages, it is exploitative bosses that seek to undermine national agreements - that's our emphasis."</p>
      <p>Questioned on whether she would be happy for immigration to rise under a Labour government, Ms Pidcock added: "I think these targets are arbitrary."</p>
      <p>When pushed on leader of the Unite union Len McCluskey's comments in the Guardian that "it's wrong to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter market regulation", Ms Pidcock said: "It isn't right that we place the blame on numbers of immigrants for wages. Actually those employers that seek to undermine those national agreements are to blame for the exploitation."</p>
      <p>She added: "And he (Mr McCluskey) talked about stricter regulations and that is what we are proposing."</p>
