      <p>The body of a man described by friends as a 'good and supportive friend' who 'spoke his mind with an eccentric flair' was found in woods in Torquay earlier this year, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>The family of David Brian Gerry, 43, reported that he'd gone missing and had been experiencing suicidal thoughts in May this year.</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police launched a major search operation following <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/police-concerned-missing-man-david-2894131">concerns for Mr Gerry's welfare</a>.</p>
      <p>After more than 20 police, ambulance and Coastguard personnel searched for Mr Gerry, his body was found in the woods near Watcombe Beach.</p>
      <p>Assistant Coroner, Deborah Archer, told the inquest at Plymouth Coroners' Court that David Brian Gerry had experienced depression since his early 20s, and had a 'long-standing low mood' and reduced motivation.</p>
      <p>He was married, had two children and a great relationship with his family, the inquest was told, and enjoyed playing football, being a key member of a five-a-side team in Torquay.</p>
      <p>Mr Gerry had been taking medication and receiving counselling on-and-off for the two years before he died and had 'life-long struggles with low mood,' the coroner said.</p>
      <p>He told a therapist he had 'good days and bad days' in June 2018, but his sleep had improved since receiving counselling.</p>
      <p>By July 2018, Mr Gerry 'described feeling better,' Ms Archer said and his mood had started to lift.</p>
      <p>He soon referred himself to the depression and anxiety team, the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Ms Archer told the inquest that Mr Gerry's parents and close family were a "protector factor" in his life, and it was his assessment by the team that first mentioned suicidal ideas.</p>
      <p>But in July 2018 he was thought to have no feelings of self-harm, nor any further 'dark thoughts'.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, Mr Gerry separated from his wife, Lucy, and moved back to his parents' house, Ms Archer said.</p>
      <p>Mr Gerry's later review, in January 2019, reported that he expressed a strong desire to reduce his medication, but by the May he reported experiencing a low mood and anxiety, with a loss of motivation and tearfulness most days.</p>
      <p>However, he had no suicidal ideation, the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>The inquest also heard that Mr Gerry had obtained a sick note from his GP and had been signed off work for two weeks.</p>
      <p>Ms Archer said this provided 'evidence of forward planning'.</p>
      <p>On the last day Mr Gerry was seen, Monday May 20, the inquest heard that Mr Gerry had gone for a meal at his parents' house, and said goodbye to his father with a big 'bear-hug', while he held his mother's hand for a significant amount of time, which the pair found unusual.</p>
      <p>This was the last time his parents saw him.</p>
      <p>He then went to the Acorn Centre for his weekly football game, and acted 'different that evening', his friend said, he "didn't want to engage in conversation," the inquest heard.</p>
      <p>He was found by police and coastguard in the woods near Watcombe beach. He had died by hanging.</p>
      <p>Mr Gerry was described by his friend as a "good and supportive friend, a handy-man who'd help me out a lot."</p>
      <p>"He spoke his mind with an eccentric flair" and played in a band, the inquest heard, and had run and played for the five-a-side football team at the Acorn Centre in Torquay for over nine years.</p>
      <p>He was always calm, never lost his temper and "would welcome anyone to join in," the inquest heard.</p>
