      <p>A suspected charity box thief has had a warrant issued for his arrest after he fled the court building.</p>
      <p>Liam Hodgson had arrived at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court</a> for his hearing on Thursday morining.</p>
      <p>But, the 32-year-old, who had travelled from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alnwick">Alnwick</a> to Bedlington, was not prepared to hang around and left the building 30 minutes later and before his case was called on.</p>
      <p>Now, a warrant has been issued for his arrest.</p>
      <p>The court was told that Hodgson, of Cedar Grove, Alnwick, was facing a charge of theft by finding after he allegedly stole a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charity">charity</a> box from Carlo's Fish and Chip shop, in his home town, on September 13 this year.</p>
      <p>How much was in the box was unknown.</p>
      <p>Alan Brown, defending, told magistrates: "He came to court and asked for us to represent him but, it seems, he's decided not to enjoy our company."</p>
      <p>Prosecutor, Lorna Rimell, added: "It's a postal requisition, which was sent to his home address, I'd apply for a warrant without bail."</p>
      <p>Magistrates agreed and an arrest warrant was issued.</p>
      <p>When police catch-up with Hodgson, he will not be allowed bail until he has appeared in the dock to face the charge.</p>
