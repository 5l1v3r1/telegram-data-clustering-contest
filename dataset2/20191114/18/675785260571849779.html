      <h1>Steven Gerrard says he regularly messages Jurgen Klopp to seek managerial advice</h1>
      <h2>Many have touted Gerrard to take over from Klopp when the German eventually leaves the European champions and the two appear to have a close relationship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:41:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has praised Jurgen Klopp for helping him in management as the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legend's stock continues to rise.</p>
      <p>Gerrard's Rangers are currently level on points with Celtic at the top of the SPL and are also performing well in the Europa League, with last week's win against Porto a particular highlight.</p>
      <p>Speculation has grown suggesting that Gerrard could be the man to step into Klopp's shoes when he departs Anfield, and Gerrard told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steven-gerrard-liverpool-rangers-news-17252732?_ga=2.149777910.1568501069.1573755111-1546131598.1565373512">Liverpool Echo</a> that he is regularly in contact with the Reds boss.</p>
      <p>"We exchange messages quite a lot," Gerrard said. "I have said it before and I will say it again, he has been fantastic for me, even going back to when I had the first chat with him at the Academy.</p>

      <p>"I thought about 'Am I doing the right thing? What would you do in my situation?' I asked him all these types of things and he has always been there to give me sound advice.</p>
      <p>"We were messaging each other just a few days ago and obviously we've both had big weeks and weekends, so yes, he has been fantastic and I can't thank him enough really."</p>
      <p>Gerrard also revealed that he takes inspiration from all of his ex-managers as he continues to build his experience as a coach.</p>

      <p>"I have tapped into them all, Rafa (Benitez), Brendan (Rodgers), Gerard Houllier, Roy Hodgson, all of them," he said. "Probably unknown to them but I have tried to tap into all of them and use it myself, and having that around what I do. But, if we talk about the Porto fixture, there are certain things we tried to do as a team that we would have done as a team when I played.</p>
      <p>"What Rafa would have said to us in that situation? What would Brendan (Rodgers) have said in and out of possession? So you try and take things from them all."</p>
