      <h1>Vocational and Technical Education would be first choice academic path - Minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:06:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">Laudia Sawer, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 14, GNA - Dr Mathew Opoku Prempeh, Minister of Education says government is working hard to ensure that Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) gains the position of first choice career and academic path.</p>
      <p>Dr Prempeh said it is unfortunate and regrettable that in Ghana, many young people see TVET as a last choice when considering an academic or career choice.</p>
      <p>The Education Minister said this at a sod-cutting and launch of the Polytechnics, Technical and Vocational Training Centres Upgrading Project at the Tema Technical Institute by Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.</p>
      <p>Dr Prempeh said for many years, the sector has not enjoyed the best of attention and prestige adding that the unfortunate consequence of that has reflected in the under-investment in the TVET sector.</p>
      <p>He said such poor investment had led to poor teaching quality, outdated curriculum, obsolete machinery and poorly equipped workshops in technical and vocational institutions.</p>
      <p>The Education Minister said as a developing country, Ghana could not continue to go down the lane of focusing on grammar education at the expense of technical and vocational training.</p>
      <p>Dr Prempeh said countries that have made great strides in development were raking in the investment they made in the vocational and technical sector.</p>
      <p>He said the government has taken a cue from countries like China to turn the fortunes of the country through practical trainings and whipping up interest in TVET as a first career choice.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to the day TVET will fully play the mainstream role and take its rightful position in the country as a career path”.</p>
      <p>Dr Prempeh said government would use it as a crucial tool to empower the energetic and teaming youth by providing them with critical skills to contribute to the country’s industrialization drive.</p>
      <p>He urged students and tutors of beneficiary institutions to take advantage of the upgrading project to acquire and impart the needed skills respectively to prepare them for the job market.</p>
