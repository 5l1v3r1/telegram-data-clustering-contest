      <p>President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign announced it raised $3.1 million in small-dollar donations during the first 24 hours of House Democrats launching public impeachment hearings on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The news was announced by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale.</p>
      <p>“One of our best fundraising days ever… again!” he wrote on Twitter. “Dems just don’t get it. They are filling our bank and improving our turnout every day!”</p>

      <p>Campaign officials told Breitbart News that the impeachment inquiry had strengthened the 2020 campaign since it was first announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in September.</p>
      <p>“Every single time they do this, we raise a fortune,” Eric Trump told Breitbart News, recalling the $15 million raised in the 72 hours since Pelosi announced the inquiry.</p>
      <p>He said that the campaign was experiencing a jump in new donors who had never donated to the president’s re-election campaign before.</p>
      <p>“Our country is doing amazing, and people don’t want to see the charade,” he said, pointing to voter scores that he was watching in swing states.</p>
      <p>Eric Trump joined Trump Victory Director of Regional Communications Rick Gorka in a call with reporters to discuss the impact that the impeachment had on the campaign.</p>
      <p>“It’s like Kavanaugh on steroids,” Gorka said, referring to the energized Republican base reacting to the baseless smears against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “The energy we’re receiving from the field has been tremendous, we’re putting them to work.”</p>
