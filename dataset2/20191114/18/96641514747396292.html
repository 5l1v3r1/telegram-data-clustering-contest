      <h1>The NSA says it stopped tracking cellphone locations without a warrant</h1>
      <h2>For now, at least.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:46:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Last year the Supreme Court ruled, in a 5-4 decision, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/22/supreme-court-ruling-requires-search-warrant-for-phone-location/">that a search warrant is required</a> for law enforcement to perform cellphone tower searches to track someone's location. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-intelligence-agencies-we-stopped-collecting-your-phones-location-data-without-probable-cause"><i>The Daily Beast</i></a> reported on a letter sent by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to Senator Ron Wyden affirming that ever since that Carpenter decision, the "Intelligence community" has not sought cell-site location data or GPS records without a warrant.</p>
      <p>It had been doing that, claiming authority under the Title V of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fisa/">FISA</a>) / Section 215 of the Patriot Act. However Section 215 of the Patriot Act is set to expire next month, and in the letter (<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/111419%20ODNI%20Reponse%20to%20Wyden%20RE%20Phone%20Location%20Tracking.pdf">PDF</a>), the assistant director writing it never confirms that the Supreme Court decision means they couldn't, or wouldn't, do it in the future.</p>
