      <h1>Plans to utilise space across Mid Devon plant more trees</h1>
      <h2>The motion has been welcomed by the Tiverton Tree Group</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:06:12+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Plans to use all land within the ownership of Mid Devon District Council to plant trees have been put forward.</p>
      <p>Councillor Bob Evans (Lower Culm, Conservative) moved the motion at a meeting on Wednesday, November 6. It will now be discussed by the Council’s Environment Policy Development Group.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is well known that the planting of trees has an extremely positive effect in the fight against reducing carbon within the atmosphere. Each trees sequestration process is known to benefit carbon reduction as each tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year and can sequester one ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old.</p>
      <p>“Given the climate crisis declared by this Council and its stated ambition to be carbon neutral by 2030, I ask that all members support the following motion.”</p>
      <p>His motion said: “This Council agrees to use any and all land within the ownership of the authority that is not suitable for development, for the planting of native British trees.</p>
      <p>“This Council agrees to undertake an area-wide audit with the assistance of members and landowners to identify suitable sites both within MDDC ownership and private ownership to maximise opportunities for such activity, to be completed within no more than twelve months from the date of this motion if approved.</p>
      <p>“This Council agrees to work alongside community groups and schools whenever possible to encourage community ownership and sense of place and wellbeing within our communities.</p>
      <p>“This Council agrees that any and all opportunities should be sought to obtain trees from organisations such as government agencies and relevant charitable organisations.”</p>

      <p>The newly formed Tiverton Tree Team welcomed the move.</p>
      <p>Miriam Hadocks from the team said she had been encouraged by the actions of the Council and their response towards the request to declare the climate emergence.</p>
      <p>She added that there had been strong support for extensive tree planting to combat climate change and that the tree team had been contacted by landowners, individuals, schools and community groups wanting to find out more. </p>
      <p>“Tiverton Tree team have received a donation of almost 1000 trees to be planted on public and community land and monetary donations to buy more,” she explained.</p>
      <p>“We have many volunteers to plant them and a vision to develop accessible community woodland, enriching the environment and encouraging local people and groups in planting and aftercare.</p>
      <p>“Time is of the essence in climate mitigation, and we plan to start on National Tree Planting Day on November 30 and continue beyond that date. This offers district residents and this Council the opportunity to take immediate positive action on our joint aims.”</p>
