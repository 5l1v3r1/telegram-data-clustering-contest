      <h1>Grade 10 girl suspended from Gauteng school after video of assault on boy goes viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T18:06:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">Jeanette Chabalala</a></address>
      <p>A 16-year-old Grade 10 female pupil at Jan Viljoen Hoerskool was suspended with immediate effect for allegedly assaulting a 16-year-old Grade 9 male pupil, the Gauteng Department of Education said on Thursday. </p>
      <p>The incident happened on Tuesday after the two wrote their exams, spokesperson Steve Mabona said.</p>
      <p>Mabona said the suspension emanated from video footage which went viral on social media, showing the female pupil assaulting a male pupil.  </p>
      <p>"It is unfortunate that the incident happened at the time when learners are busy with their year-end examinations," he said.</p>
      <p>"We strongly condemn any misdemeanour in schools, which could lead to serious action being taken against a learner. We have dispatched our psycho-social team to provide necessary support to all affected by the said incident."</p>
      <p>Mabona said the school governing body would facilitate the disciplinary process in due course and that the department would ensure that proper procedures were followed.</p>
      <p>Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi urged principals and educators to respond appropriately when cases of bullying, violence and intimidation were reported. </p>
      <p>"Ignoring these reports makes the victim feel more vulnerable and subjected to secondary trauma of adults that show a cavalier attitude. We also urge our learners to refrain from any acts of misconduct in schools, as it will impact negatively on their performance," Lesufi said.  </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in a separate incident, Mabona said a group of parents locked the gates at Mountainview Secondary School in Heidelberg on Tuesday, preventing teachers and pupils from entering the school yard. </p>
      <p>Mabona said the parents had indicated that they had long standing grievances which were not being addressed by the district.</p>
      <p>He said, due to the disruptions at the school, Grade 9 and Grade 11 pupils could not write their exams. He said the exams would be rescheduled to another date and that pupils would continue as normal from Friday.  </p>
      <p>However, he added that it was encouraging that the Grade 12 pupils had been transported by officials to an undisclosed venue where they continued with their examinations. </p>
