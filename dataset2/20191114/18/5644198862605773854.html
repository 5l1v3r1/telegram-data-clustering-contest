      <p>SINGAPORE: The Jurong-Clementi Town Council said on Thursday (Nov 14) that the fire hose reels over which it was <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bukit-batok-fire-3-rescued-12054054">issued a warning</a> by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) had been locked to prevent vandalism. </p>
      <p>In a statement last week, SCDF said that its firefighters were responding to a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bukit-batok-fire-3-rescued-12054054">blaze at an HDB flat in Bukit Batok</a> when they realised several of the hose reel cabinets had been padlocked.  </p>

      </h3>
      <p>Even after breaking one of the padlocks, the hose reel could not be used because there was no water supply, said SCDF. </p>
      <p>Responding to CNA's queries, the town council said it had locked the hose reels at Block 210A Bukit Batok because they had been "frequently misused and vandalised". </p>

      <p>“As a precaution, a small padlock was used to prevent casual vandalism. We have since removed all padlocks,” said the spokesperson.</p>
      <p>General manager of the town council, Mr Ho Thian Poh, said earlier that the fire hose reels at Block 210A had been <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fire-hose-reels-bukit-batok-flat-jurong-clementi-town-council-12088742">certified to be in working condition</a>. </p>
      <p>They were last put through maintenance and testing on Oct 14 this year. </p>
