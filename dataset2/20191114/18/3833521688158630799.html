      <h1>N.B. moves toward privatization of cannabis sales following losses in first year</h1>

      <p>FREDERICTON - New Brunswick has issued a request for proposals for a single private operator to take over the government's operation, distribution and sales of recreational cannabis in the province.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Ernie Steeves says today that after a careful analysis, the government concluded the best approach was to turn to the private sector.</p>
      <p>Interested proponents will have until Jan. 10, 2020 to submit proposals.</p>
      <p>Cannabis NB, a provincial Crown corporation, lost almost $12 million in its first six months and continues to bleed red ink, although sales are on the rise.</p>
      <p>It was announced last month that second quarter losses for the current year were $1.5 million.</p>
      <p>Steeves says he expects strong interest in the request for proposals.</p>
