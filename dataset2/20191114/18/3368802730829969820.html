      <p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said the government would probe if there was any ill motive and conspiracy behind the recent train accidents and take necessary action after completion of the investigation.</p>
      <p>Delivering her winding-up speech at the fifth session of the 11th parliament, she expressed deep sorrow at the deaths of passengers in Tuesday’s train accident in Brahmanbaria.</p>
      <p>“An accident is an accident. The train accident took place in Kasba due to fog. The driver could not see the signals due to fog and this caused the accident.”</p>
      <p>The premier said another train accident occurred in Ullapara of Sirajganj, but only a few people suffered minor injuries. “We usually see several similar incidents occur following an incident. We have to see why this happens.”</p>
      <p>She said the number of train accidents increases in the winter and the government was pondering about what could be done in this regard. </p>
      <p>Hasina said she has already instructed the authorities concerned to repair all the old rail lines.</p>
      <p>The premier thanked the lawmakers for keeping parliament vibrant. “No foul language was used in parliament. We have ensured a tolerant environment at the Jatiya Sangsad, which is good for democracy.”</p>
      <p>Turning to electricity coverage, she said a total of 234 upazilas have been brought under 100 percent electricity coverage and electricity production has reached 22,400 MW.</p>
      <p>“We will ensure electricity for all upazilas within a year. We will arrange solar panels at places which are out of the coverage of the national grid.”</p>
      <p>Talking about the ongoing drive against drug and corruption, the PM said the drive would continue.</p>
      <p>About the recent protests at several public universities, she said some teachers were using the students for their gains. “Such activities of the teachers were hampering the education of all students.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Leader of the Opposition Raushan Ershad in her concluding speech at the session said the killing of Nusrat Jahan Rafi in Feni was a testimony to how much cruelty existed in the society now. The madrasa student was sexually harassed before being burnt to death, she added.</p>
      <p>She suggested continuing the ongoing drive against bribery, casinos, drug and criminal activities.</p>
      <p>“Such activities had been going on for a long time. Why didn’t the police take action against illegal casino business and others earlier? Why didn’t the home minister take any step?” Raushan questioned.</p>
      <p>She criticised the metro rail project saying that the country lacked skilled manpower to run metro rail. “You cannot even run trains properly. Then how will you operate metro rail?”</p>
      <p>The opposition leader also urged the International Cricket Council to reduce the two-year ban imposed on cricketer Shakib Al Hasan, saying that people wanted to see him on the field.</p>
      <p>Raushan urged the government to step up the drive against food adulteration. “People have been taking adulterated food for years. We want safe food.”</p>
      <p>The fifth session of the current parliament had begun on November 7. Six bills were placed and three were passed by the House during the brief session.</p>
