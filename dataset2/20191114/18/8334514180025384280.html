      <p>Houston Rockets center Clint Capela is expected to miss at least one game after being evaluated for a concussion, ESPN reported Thursday.</p>
      <p>Capela bumped his head while attempting to draw a charge on the Los Angeles Clippers’ JaMychal Green during the fourth quarter of Wednesday’s 102-93 victory.</p>
      <p>Veteran Tyson Chandler would likely get the start at center Friday against the visiting Indiana Pacers if Capela is not available.</p>
      <p>Capela tallied 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting and grabbed 20 rebounds against the Clippers, his seventh double-double in 11 starts this season.</p>
      <p>Capela, 25, is averaging 13.4 points and 12.5 rebounds this season and owns career averages of 12.0 points and 9.3 boards in 306 games.</p>
