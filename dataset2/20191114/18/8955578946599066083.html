      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 14 – RIA Tomsk.</b> Who owns rights to a work made by artificial intelligence? Can neural network developer claim money for using findings if open data is at heart? Many questions will be answered by conference participants "Intellectual Rights: Challenges of the XXI Century", which is held at <a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU). More details – in material of RIA Tomsk.</p>
      <p>Earlier it was reported that the international scientific and practical conference "Intellectual Rights: Challenges of the XXI Century" will be held on November 14-17 in the 31 building of TSU (Embankment of Ushayka, 12). The partners of the conference are Gazprombank, Skolkovo Foundation, Russian Bar Association, European Media Group and a number of Russian and foreign patent law firms.</p>
      <h4>Leader's ambitions</h4>
      <p>According to the rector of TSU Eduard Galazhinsky (the participants of the conference saw his opening speech in the record), intellectual property issues for the university are not only and not so much scientific, but an applied task.</p>
      <p>"According to the research of Rospatent, TSU is one of the five leading inventive institutions of the country, occupies the leading position in the number of registered intellectual property objects. And it is important for us to understand not only how to protect our intellectual achievements, but also how to quickly translate them into knowledge and technology", – Galazhinsky said.</p>
      <p>According to the Rector, created together with Gazprombank and Skolkovo Foundation in 2018 Scientific and Educational Center (NOC) "Intellectual Property and Intellectual Rights" claims to be a leader in the examination of intellectual property legislation today.</p>
      <blockquote>"Those fields, that we are entering, are related to the use of new technologies, artificial intelligence, blockchain in solving legal issues, and I think we should be the first in these areas together with the participants of this conference. But it is not even about who is faster, it is important that those real projects on which the university is working are implemented and protected as a result", – Galazhinsky said.</blockquote>
      <p>However, Elena Borisenko, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Management of Gazprombank, noted in her speech, it is not enough to simply gather leading specialists on its site and open a research program:</p>

      <p>"Lawyers, by virtue of their conservativeness, are not inclined to high-speed decisions. And not just in Russia. But this world will need us only when we meet the challenges of time. Our expertise is relevant only here and now, not in the long term. We must explain to innovators why the protection of intellectual rights is not a deterrent to progress, but a factor of development".</p>
      <h4>Who owns artificial intelligence?</h4>
      <p>Intellectual property issues in the era of artificial intelligence are far from idle, the participants of the conference note. There are many unusual nuances to traditional legal advisers even in the simplest disputes of developers and their employers about who owns intellectual rights to invention.</p>
      <blockquote>"With regard to intellectual property, even such aspects are important as evidence of intellectual property: on which computer the program code underlying the invention is written – on a personal, or owned corporation. Intellectual property is always a fine line", – Dmitry Zauers, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Gazprombank said.</blockquote>
      <p>Intellectual property problems are seriously complicated when working with artificial intelligence. There is no universal answer to the question: who owns the product obtained by AI based on open source analysis (for example, data from social media users)? And if AI independently creates works of art based on the algorithm, the Chairman of the Board of the Skolkovo Foundation Igor Drozdov asks.</p>
      <p>"Who owns that AI created? The answer is whether working with AI is creative. The share of creative component in work with modern technologies is decreasing from year to year. Should we consider the right owner an engineer who works with a neural network that creates works of art independently, without his direct creative participation? This is an open question", – Drozdov said.</p>

      <p>Another problem faced by legal practitioners in the field of intellectual property protection is the constant "fluidity" of technology, which requires too frequent changes in the texts of laws governing this field. Thus, legislators are reviewing the whole package of laws of the Russian Federation at present, excluding the term "computer programs for ECM" and replacing it with "computer programs" from them.</p>
      <blockquote>"Legislation must be technologically neutral. The law should not describe technology in detail, as technology will change quickly and will require changing legislation. For example, if we write in the law on biometric data, we will trap the law with a specific technology, which may change tomorrow", – Drozdov said.</blockquote>
      <p>Participants of the conference will discuss "fluid" legal practice on intellectual property protection within three days. Specialists are ready to share their recommendations with players of the innovative sector of the economy.</p>
