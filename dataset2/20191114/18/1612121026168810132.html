      <p>November is a great month for buying a TV. That’s typically when we see the best deals on them, and right now TCL has jumped on the bandwagon even ahead of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>There are several options of TCL TVs discounted on Amazon, some of which are over 40% off. There’s a mix of 5-series and 6-series here, too, so you get some flexibility with what you want to pay for.</p>
      <p>The cheapest of the bunch of a 32-inch TV down to just $149. This one’s much more basic, but would be great in a spare room or bedroom. If you want to step up into something for playing games or watching movies, they have a 43-inch and 55-inch Roku TV on sale for $299 and $399, respectively. Both of these TVs support Dolby Vision, which is really rare in this price point, and have Roku’s whole ecosystem built-in.</p>
      <p>If you’re wanting to step up to something a little nicer, the TCL 6-series 55″ and 65″ TVs are down to $599 and $799. These are QLED TVs with Quantum Dot technology, so you’ll see a pretty nice improvement in color reproduction and contrast on these sets, and they still support Dolby Vision, too. The 75-inch version is on sale for $1399, which is definitely getting pricey, but hey, if you’re gonna go big, go all the way.</p>
