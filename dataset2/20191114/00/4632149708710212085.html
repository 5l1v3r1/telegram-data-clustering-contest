      <p><i>He had asked them to clean up after one of them puked in car</i> <br/><br/>A 28-year-old man, who couldn’t shrug off two particularly insistent hitchhikers, had to regret giving them a ride. The two men, who were drunk to begin with, puked in the car and when the man asked them to clean up, they thrashed him and hit him with a beer bottle inside his own car on Friday midnight in Marathahalli. <br/><br/>The victim, Avinash BN, a resident of Kumbalgodu who works as a driver with a software company, has filed a complaint with the Marathahalli police.</p>
      <p>I stopped my car and the two asked me to drop them to their house. They seemed drunk so I refused. They did not let me pass and blocked my car ­</p>
      <p>–Avinash BN<br/><br/>Avinash said that on Friday night, he was returning to the company after dropping employees at various locations when two men blocked his vehicle on Tulasi Road in Marathahalli around 12:30 am. <br/><br/>“I stopped my car and the two asked me to drop them to their house on CGI Road. The two seemed drunk so I refused to give them a ride. They did not let me pass and blocked the car all the while arguing with me. I was scared and I agreed to drop them as that location was on my way. While we were on our way, one of them puked inside my car. I stopped for a while, but then started again. I told them to clean the vehicle as it belonged to the company. <br/><br/>They agreed and said they would do so as soon as we get to their house. So I went on and once there, I also got down along with them and asked them to clean the car,” said Avinash.</p>

      <p>This is when things started going out of hand. “One of them opened a beer bottle and tried to clean the car with beer. I immediately stopped him and asked him to go inside and get water to clean it. To that, they said they had only agreed to clean the car but had not mentioned whether they would use water or beer. I tried to stop them from pouring the beer inside my car and told them that it would stink even more. He got irked by this and pushed me inside the car and hit my on the eye with the bottle. I tried to defend myself but both of them overpowered me and attacked me,” he said. <br/><br/><br/>The two men punched Avinash in the face and with the bottle hit him on the back. “My face started bleeding and my white shirt had turned red. I managed to run away from them and immediately dialed 100. The police rushed to my help and took the two of them into custody,” he said. <br/><br/>Avinash sustained a deep cut around his right eye and got himself treated at a private hospital before filing a written complaint with the Marathahalli police. <br/><br/><br/>Marathahalli police have registered a case and have booked the two under IPC sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).</p>
