      <p>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - A months-long independent probe into the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/virginia-beach/">Virginia Beach</a> mass shooting has concluded, but it offers no clear answers as to why a city engineer killed 12 people in his workplace, according to findings released Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The investigation, conducted by Chicago-based security company <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hillard-heintze/">Hillard Heintze</a>, found no warning signs by the shooter that could have helped the city prevent the May 31 tragedy.</p>
      <p>The firm also said that the longtime city employee did not work in a systemically toxic workplace, which some people in this coastal city of nearly 500,000 had proposed as a possible factor.</p>
      <p>What the investigation did reveal was a man who experienced the kind of pressures and life challenges that many people do.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">DeWayne Craddock</a>, 40, had gone through a divorce and was having trouble at work. He wrote emails on his work computer that went unsent but claimed he was unjustly disciplined.</p>

      <p>But independent investigators were at a loss to explain how such “stressors” could have translated into violence.</p>
      <p>“The information is just not there,” the independent security firm’s CEO, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arnette-heintze/">Arnette Heintze</a>, told reporters after presenting a 262-page report to Virginia Beach’s City Council.</p>
      <p>“What we can tell you is that in 2016 his life started changing,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arnette-heintze/">Heintze</a> said. “We can tell you that he started acquiring firearms … body armor and silencers. He starts visiting (newspaper websites that are reporting) on mass shootings.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">Craddock</a> had worked in the city’s public utilities department. He used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to kill 11 of his co-workers and a contractor who had stopped at the city’s sprawling municipal complex to get a permit.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">Craddock</a> had submitted his resignation earlier in the day, citing “personal reasons.”</p>
        <p>The independent probe’s report will likely do little for family members of the victims who have been grasping for answers and critical of the investigations.</p>
        <p>A police investigation into the massacre is ongoing. An update in September from police investigators did not offer a clear motive, either.</p>
        <p>Jason Nixon, whose wife Kate Nixon was killed by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">Craddock</a>, said the independent investigation was a “dog and pony show” that “regurgitated” information provided by Virginia Beach police. He said no real independent digging was done.</p>
        <p>“Family members are beyond upset,” he said.</p>
        <p>Nixon said his wife wrote up <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">Craddock</a> for having a poor attitude. But he said such details were glossed over. Nixon said he plans to ask state police to conduct an investigation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the probe offered several recommendations to the city. They included suggestions that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/virginia-beach/">Virginia Beach</a> improve its workplace violence prevention programs, human resources functions and mass-notification alerting systems.</p>
        <p>The independent investigation, however, was also somewhat limited in scope. The security firm did not have access to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">Craddock</a>’s personal computer, which <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arnette-heintze/">Heintze</a> attributed to an ongoing investigation by the FBI.</p>
        <p>Dwight Brown, whose daughter LaQuita Brown was killed, said after Wednesday’s presentation that independent investigators failed to talk to him during their probe. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arnette-heintze/">Heintze</a> responded that they had talked to at least some members of her family.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arnette-heintze/">Heintze</a> also underscored the challenge of trying to understand someone like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dewayne-craddock/">Craddock</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arnette-heintze/">Heintze</a> described the shooter as “truly isolated and such a loner” that he didn’t have relationships with people “who could have provided some insight.”</p>
