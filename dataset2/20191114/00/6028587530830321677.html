      <p>Former UFC Lightweight champion, UFC Featherweight title challenger and future Hall-of-Famer Frankie Edgar is moving down to bantamweight. While on the surface that sounds like a cool idea, there are several reasons for Edgar fans to be worried.Cory Sandhagen, the man who will welcome Edgar to the 135-pound division, might be the worst possible matchup for him.</p>

      <p>Also, while the move to 135 is sensible, it might be coming four years too late.</p>
      <p>Edgar just turned 38 and he’s coming off a loss to UFC Featherweight champion Max Holloway at UFC 240 in July. There wasn’t much of a future for Edgar at featherweight.</p>
      <p>That seemed clear after he was knocked out by Brian Ortega in March 2018, but a victory over the spiraling Cub Swanson earned Edgar a lifetime-achievement title shot against Holloway.</p>
      <p>Now that he’s embracing a move to bantamweight, the UFC is serving the 5’6” Edgar up to a 5’11” Sandhagen who is in the midst of a seven-fight win streak. Sandhagen is a gifted striker who also boasts a wide range of grappling talents. He’s beaten the hard-hitting John Lineker and multi-talented Raphael Assuncao in his last two bouts, and could be just one or two wins away from his own title shot.</p>

      <p>If we’re being honest, most can see Sandhagen’s movement and length creating an insurmountable challenge for Edgar. To win, Edgar has to close the distance and make it a grappling match, but there is no guaranteed he’ll have a marked advantage over Sandhagen on the ground.</p>
      <p>In every way possible, this seems like a bad matchup for Edgar. However, it is a fight and strange, unexpected things can happen. At the time of publication, there were no odds on this bout. However, I’d be shocked if Sandhagen wasn’t a sizable favorite.</p>
      <p>If Edgar can pull the upset, it will be arguably the biggest win of his career. Almost no one will expect Edgar to beat a man 11 years his junior, five inches taller, and who also employs a style that should give him problems. If Edgar loses, and is stopped or wiped out over the course of three rounds, talk of the legend’s retirement will be augmented.</p>
      <p>At that point, you have to wonder why Edgar was given this kind of a matchup in his first bantamweight bout. Edgar is never one to run from challenges, but this one isn’t likely to end well.</p>
