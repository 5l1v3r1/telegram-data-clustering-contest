      <p>These days, <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> defaults into a high fantasy mode. Films like <i>Harry Potter</i> and the adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien’s works have installed the idea of flashy magic and epic quests into the minds of many fantasy fans. It wasn’t always this way. Low fantasy, such as the Fahfrd and the Grey Mouser series and the adventures of Conan The Barbarian, influenced earlier editions of tabletop RPGs as much in the earlier days of the hobby. Gamers who are hungry for a game where characters must hold on for dear life through a deadly learning curve until they can truly call themselves adventurers will find a lot to love in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524851663/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=grimandperilo-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1524851663&amp;linkId=8f792e981af95eb6151f24de1a61ae0d"><i>Zweihander </i></a><i>RPG</i>.<i>Zweihander</i> characters aren’t made; they are rolled. While most modern designs give players a firm hand in choosing character elements, <i>Zweihander</i> offers several charts that cover everything from class and flaws to height and weight. There’s a certain charm to being handed a handful of traits and stitching them together to form a character. Sometimes the blank character sheet can be a terrifying mountain to climb and. Putting the puzzle pieces together exercises different parts of creativity. The random rolls can also push players out of their comfort zones. Players who might always play wizards might find playing a fighting character a refreshing change or an exhilarating challenge.</p>

      <p>The classes also aren’t ones exactly sound like the types of people who should make their livings as wandering adventurers. A Cultist or a Bounty Hunter probably already has the kind of skills to survive in a cave full of monsters, but a Fop or Valet seems to be more likely to end up bleeding out in the dark. The key to new characters is their survival to the expert levels which all feel a bit more like the fantasy heroes fans are used to. Persevere to these levels and that Bounty Hunter becomes an Assassin or that Fop becomes a Grail Knight. <i>Zweihander</i> makes even the smallest success or advancement feel better given everyone’s humble beginnings.</p>
      <p>Each character also gets a Dooming, which is a prophecy at 10 years old that tells the child how they will die. The tables for these are full of deliciously vague statements like “you shall see thine death twice” or “beware the black stallion” that a good GM can insert to tense up their group. A player with the former doom will tense up the second time they meet any NPC while one with the latter doom will start sweating bullets the moment they realize their generous lord has a black stallion on their heraldry. <i>Zweihander</i> drips with flavor in these moments and even when the character is made up of random bits rolled from a chart, it’s hard to walk away from character creation without at least one interesting hook to play.</p>
      <p>The default setting is caught between the forces of Order and Chaos. Each character gains a personality trait connected to one of these alignments. They act like dramatic poles that the player can switch through depending on how they are feeling that day. Some days, a character might feel witty, other days they might feel scorn. Whenever a character acts in accordance with one, they gain levels toward that alignment. Acting toward the order side of things gives a character a fate point, which offers the rare opportunity to buck the randomness of the system and shrug off a bad die roll or a fatal blow. Embracing chaos means mutations, addictions and more as the character is warped by their choices. Smart GMs will avoid clear cut choices between good and evil, instead offering the harder choices that have plagued fans of Bioware games for decades.</p>
      <p>Roleplaying veterans might get a sense of familiarity here. <i>Zweihander</i> began as a fan-made update of <i>Warhammer Fantasy Role Play</i> that eventually morphed into its own thing. The basics are the same: Add attribute plus skill as a percentage, roll percentile dice and try to get under the percentage. There are a few modern tweaks added for playability. Critical successes and failures key off of doubles on the percentile dice. Certain abilities and conditions will also flip the order of the percentile dice making failure much more difficult in a specific area. This is where the abilities of less glamorous classes often come into play. That Fop might not be the best with a blade, but their Fame &amp; Fortune ability means they will never suffer a critical failure on a test, ever, and that can mean the difference between life or death.</p>
      <p>While <i>Zweihander</i> takes a lot of inspiration from Warhammer, the world it creates offers a dark allure of its own. It’s a world where nobody is truly good nor completely evil, where magic is powerful yet terrifying and where anything the players get is taken. It wouldn’t take much to turn this game into the world of <i>the Witcher</i> or even Westeros for fans of <i>Game of Thrones. Zweihander</i> offers a game that’s full of chaos and death but also a grim beauty that matches its excellent pencil sketch illustrations.</p>
