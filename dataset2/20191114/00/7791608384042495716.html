      <p><b><i>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</i></b> actor Noah Centineo has become an internet meme from his baffling acceptance speech, but in one fell swoop, the 23-year-old has also inadvertently dragged David Spade down with him. <br/><b>Centineo recently won</b> the Favorite Comedy Movie Star category of this year’s People’s Choice Award. The actor hobbled to the stage with his crutches, which he had to use due to a recent knee injury, and gave a “cringe-worthily” <a href="https://twitter.com/OrangePaulp/status/1193952890018304000?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">confusing speech</a> that ultimately turned into a meme. <br/><b>He gave his thanks,</b> but not without leaving everyone confused with his departing words, “It matters not what you’ve done but what you do with what you’ve done for others.” <br/><b>If you’re equally</b> confused by that sentence, don’t worry, you are not alone.</p>

      <p><b>It must have been</b> a good day for meme lovers, as the camera also panned over to a seemingly baffled David Spade, who was spotted licking his lips with a confused look plastered on his face. This is a meme-ception at its finest. <br/><b>The moment has opened</b> the internet’s floodgates, launching plenty of Spade-centered memes. <br/><b>In response,</b> the <i>Grown Ups</i> actor took to his show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeEhUyVyEMc&amp;utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Lights Out with David Spade</i></a> on <i>Comedy Central</i> to address the matter directly. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>“So, the People’s</b> Choice Awards were last night. I was there. I had a good time,” he said, before adding, “I got memed for some dumb reaction I had in the audience. So embarrassing,” he confessed. <br/><b>He then soldiered up</b> and declared that such award shows are “long,” and that audience members are not aware “when you are on camera.” <br/><b>Take a look</b> at some hilarious reactions below.</p>
