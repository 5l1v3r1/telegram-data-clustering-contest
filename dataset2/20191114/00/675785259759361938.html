      <h2>Ian Huntley killed Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both aged 10, in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002 - and is now serving life imprisonment in HMP Frankland where he allegedly kicked a guard</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:13:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Child killer Ian Huntley was locked up in solitary confinement after swearing at an official and kicking a guard, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Huntley was  allegedly first thrown in isolation after breaching prison rules by saying 'f*** off' to a worker.</p>
      <p>He was then taken out of his cell for an adjudication hearing, however, he soon returned to solitary after reportedly kicking a prison guard.</p>
      <p>The kick was described as 'pathetic' by a jail source, who also claimed the murderer was crying as he was dragged back to segregation, an article states.</p>
      <p>The monster's special privileges were said to have been taken away after the attack, meaning he lost his £20-a-week painting job and was not allowed to buy fish and chip dinners.</p>

      <p>Huntley was thrown into isolation in HMP Frankland, in Durham, in August - and his prison time is now said to be catching up with him, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10341990/ian-huntley-meltdown-solitary-twice/">The Sun</a> . </p>
      <p>The prisoner killed Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both aged 10, in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in jail in 2003.</p>

      <p>Describing Huntley's latest attack, a jail source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10341990/ian-huntley-meltdown-solitary-twice/">The Sun</a> : “It was a pretty pitiful, pathetic attempt, more a trip than a kick.</p>
      <p>“Huntley was quickly restrained and taken back to segregation again, sobbing as he went.</p>
      <p>"He’s almost unrecognisable now from what the public would remember.</p>
      <p>"He looks like a skinny old man with no fight left in him."</p>

      <p>The murderer is at constant risk of attack from other prisoners and has had a string of health problems and suicide attempts in jail.</p>
      <p>Damien Fowkes, a serial armed robber, slashed Huntley's throat in HMP Frankland in 2010.</p>
      <p>The murderer was recorded apologising for the 2002 killings last year.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that the monster had struck up a close bond behind bars with a fellow prisoner named 'Luna', who is transitioning.</p>
