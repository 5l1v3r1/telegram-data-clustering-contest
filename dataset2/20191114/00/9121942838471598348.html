      <p>NEW DELHI (AP) — Schools in India’s capital are shut after air quality plunged to a severe category for the third consecutive day, enveloping New Delhi in a thick gray haze of noxious air.</p>
      <p>According to the state-run Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index Thursday exceeded 460, nine times the level recommended by the WHO.</p>
      <p>Buildings and monuments are largely obscured by the haze and an official health advisory has asked residents to avoid all physical activity outdoors.</p>
      <p>Air pollution in northern India, including New Delhi, peaks in the winter due to smoke from agricultural fires.</p>
      <p>The smoke from fields mixes with vehicle emissions and construction dust, making it the world’s most polluted capital.</p>
