      <h1>John Lewis Unveils Amusing 2019 Christmas Ad Featuring A Baby Arsonist Dragon</h1>

      <p><b>John Lewis’</b> much-anticipated Christmas advert has dropped, and it stars an adorable, unintentionally trouble-making dragon called Excitable Edgar. <br/><b>This year,</b> John Lewis teamed up with sister brand Waitrose to create the festive commercial, which will run on its social media platforms. The ad centers around Excitable Edgar the baby dragon, who loves Christmas but can’t seem to control his fire-breathing instincts. This often leads to disastrous consequences. <br/><b>Due to his excitement,</b> Edgar accidentally melts an ice rink, turns a snowman into a puddle, and sets a Christmas tree on fire. Despaired, Edgar tucks himself away from his village but his friend Ava convinces him to join in on the festivities and helps him put his fire-breathing tendencies to good use. <br/><b>Ava encourages Edgar</b> to help create the gift of Christmas, a pudding, resulting in applause and cheers from the village folk. The positive response pleases Edgar. <br/><b>Waitrose’s customer director</b> Martin George explains that the “Christmas pudding scene” will hopefully remind viewers that “a thoughtful gesture can mean so much.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>George adds</b> that the “the magic of friendship is one of the most wonderful things” of the festive period. <br/><b>The film was created</b> by communications agency <a href="http://www.adamandeveddb.com/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">adam&amp;eve DDB</a>, who also worked on John Lewis’ 2009 Christmas advert. <br/><b>The campaign also</b> comes with a full range of Edgar merchandise, including a £15 (US$19.27) cuddly toy, chocolate Edgars and gingerbread cookies. An Excitable Edgar filter is also available to Snapchat users, while an emoji of the dragon will be available on Twitter until 25 December. <br/><b>The ad also encourages</b> engagement with a positive cause. The company has teamed up with food poverty charity <a href="https://fareshare.org.uk/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">FareShare</a>, with feasts held in John Lewis stores and venues ahead of Christmas.</p>
