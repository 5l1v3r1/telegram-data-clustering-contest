      <h1>2019 Volvo XC40 R-Design Review: 4 Things You Need To Know</h1>

      <p>The XC40 is a newer vehicle from the Volvo Brand and the smallest SUV in their lineup behind the XC60. But sometimes big things come in small packages, and and the XC40 has so much personality it’s bursting at the seams.  </p>

        <b>Spacious Interior</b>
      </p>
      <p>My test car was equipped with the R-Design package, Volov's equivalent to a sports-package. This build includes some unique features and great options, such as the Lava carpeting, a special R-Design steering wheel, sport paddle gear selectors, and seats finished in perforated Nappa Leather and Nubuck upholstery. </p>

      <p>I especially loved the interior door panels, as they are also done in Lava upholstery, giving the entire interior of the vehicle a warm and fuzzy feel to it. </p>

      <p>Even though it's a smaller vehicle, the interior gives off a spacious experience, and that's thanks to the glass roof, low center console, and a minimalistic space-saving design.  Elements like large storage compartments in the doors, under the seats and in the trunk all ensure that you have plenty of room to stow your stuff without cluttering the drive. Other highlights include a removable bin in the mid console, a small fold-away hook as part of the glove compartment, and easily-accessible slots for credit and service cards.</p>

        <b>Excellent Road Manners</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you're looking for an SUV that won't break the bank like an X2 M35i, but still offers driving fun and quick acceleration, look no further than the XC40’s T5 engine.  It boasts 248 horsepower and a substantial 350 pound-feet of torque, which yields a 0-60 time of just 6.3 seconds. Steering is precise and offers respectable road-feel, especially for a vehicle in this segment. </p>

      <p>Not everything under the hood is perfect though, as the XC40's engine has a harsh tone to it, especially noticeable when putting the pedal down for rapid acceleration.  That's partly due to sub-par cabin insulation, but the engine could also use some refinements to reduce cabin noise.</p>

        <b>Thoughtful Exterior Design </b>
      </p>
      <p>The smaller the SUV, the harder it is to incorporate stylish design, as there is physically less surface to work with.  Despite that general rule, however, I believe the designers at Volvo did a great job with the XC40. In keeping with the brand's style identity, it features vertical taillights, cute egg shaped mirrors, and Thor's hammer accent LED lights.  These accents hold up well even when going up against the style choices of larger vehicles.</p>

        <b>Final Thoughts</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 2019 Volvo XC40 incorporates most of the things you would want from a small SUV, including a plethora of active safety features, distance guided cruise control, a functional yet novel interior, cute exterior design, potent T5 powertrain, and all at a reasonable starting price of just over $35,500.  However, the XC40 lacks a powerful sound system (even the optional Harman/Kardon system just isn't enough for true music lovers), and sadly it suffers from a rough engine note under moderate to heavy acceleration. Everything considered, it's still a great vehicle and would be at the top of my list-in-class alongside the BMW X2 and Lincoln Corsair.</p>
