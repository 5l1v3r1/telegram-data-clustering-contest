      <p>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - North Carolina State finally had a full roster - and most of those players found their scoring touch.</p>
      <p>C.J. Bryce scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a> had six double-figure scorers in its 86-77 victory over Florida International on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Pat Andree and Devon Daniels added 14 points apiece to help <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a> (2-1) win its second straight. The Wolfpack played eight players and each of them logged at least 14 minutes.</p>
      <p>“You notice through our games, nobody on our team is going to put up 30 points a game,” said D.J. Funderburk, a forward who missed the first two games because he was suspended indefinitely for violating team policy.</p>
      <p>“The point spread is kind of equal, everybody can go get a bucket,” he added, “and as long as we keep playing together and keep composure down the stretch, we’ll be all right.”</p>

      <p>Funderburk finished with 11 points while Markell Johnson and Manny Bates each had 10. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a> beat FIU at its own game, forcing 22 turnovers from an FIU team that itself thrives on takeaways.</p>
      <p>Devon Andrews scored a season-best 21 points and Tevin Brewer finished with a season-best 19 for the Panthers (1-2). They had the ball trailing by six points in the final minute before Cameron Corcoran missed a 3-pointer and Markell Johnson hit a free throw with 42.2 seconds remaining to put <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a> up 81-74.</p>
      <p>Brewer was called for double dribbling with 28.9 seconds left, Bryce hit a free throw with 27.9 seconds to play, Antonio Daye Jr. turned it over on FIU’s next possession and Bryce pushed the lead to 84-74 with two free throws with 21.5 seconds to play.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a> also built a 38-31 rebounding advantage, turning that into 20 second-chance points to just seven for the Panthers.</p>

        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Florida International: The Panthers are at their best when they’re forcing turnovers and generating steals and deflections - they led the nation with averages of 19.6 turnovers forced and 5.6 steals last season -and forced at least 18 turnovers in both of their previous games. The tables turned in this one: They went almost six minutes in the second half between field goals, turning it over eight times during a 10-possession stretch, and finished with 22 of them.</p>
        <p>“We got shots up, we were scoring and we were efficient,” coach Jeremy Ballard said. “But way too often, we gave the other team the ball. … Last year, we made our money on turning people over and valuing the ball. … But right now, we’re just not valuing the ball enough, and it’s a shame because we score when we take care of it.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a>: The Wolfpack finally had their full complement of players with Funderburk making his season debut 3:33 in, and coach Kevin Keatts certainly was glad to have more bodies on his bench.</p>
        <p>“I probably, two weeks ago, had the best eight-man practice schedule you could have, and I’m tired of that,” Keatts said. “Now it’s good to have five-on-five.”</p>
        <p>HOT HAND</p>
        <p>With <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nc-state/">N.C. State</a> down 10 early, Andree hit four 3s in the span of three minutes, with the fourth tying it at 24 with 8 ½ minutes before the break.</p>
        <p>WELCOME BACK</p>
        <p>This was a homecoming for two FIU players: Senior guard Trejon Jacob is from Raleigh while nearby Durham is the hometown of sophomore guard Antonio Daye Jr.</p>
