      <h1>New Galaxy S11 Leak Reveals Punchy And Powerful Phone</h1>

      <p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung’s</a> next flagship - <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/11/samsung-galaxy-s11-screen-samoled-trademark-new-screen-details-spec-launch-date/">the Galaxy S11</a> - is expected to launch in February 2020, which means the vast majority of the design will be locked in. That means the geekerati are on the digital hunt for information about the new daily of handsets. And the latest specifications easter egg may have been delivered by <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a>.</p>

      <p>Details on Qualcomm’s upcoming SnapDragon 865 have been posted on the Chinese social network <a href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/IfKHU0U2H?from=page_1005056048569942_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment">Weibo</a>, which matches up with expectations, <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/alleged-snapdragon-865-leak-glimpse-galaxy-s11/">as SamMobile reports</a>:</p>
      <p>"Unsurprisingly, the Snapdragon 865 is being manufactured on a 7nm EUV process, same as the Exynos 990. After all, both chipsets are being mass-produced by Samsung. As usual, however, there are more differences than similarities between the two solutions.</p>
      <p>"A total of eight CPU cores will reportedly beat at the heart of the Snapdragon 865 SoC. There are four ARM Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8GHz, along with three Cortex-A77 cores clocked at 2.42GHz, and one high-performance Cortex-A77 core operating at a frequency of 2.84GHz.”</p>
      <p>More importantly is the modem that is executed to be in the SoC. The listed X55 modem offers 5G connectivity, and with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/23/samsung-galaxy-s11-5g-portfolio-new-leak-rumor-specs-launch-date/">Samsung expected to offer the three key flavours of the S11 family</a> (the tightly focused S11e, the standard S11, and the larger S11+) with 5G connectivity the modem matches up to S11’s capabilities.</p>
      <p>The same is true of the GPU chip that will allow for faster processing of imaging data, with 8K HDR video within reach, and a NPU (Neural Processing Unit) which should allow for more AI algorithms to take place on the device rather than in the cloud - which increases the security around personal data.</p>

      <p>All the above remains unconfirmed, but with Qualcomm expected to launch new products in early December we may have more details on the SnapDragon 865 at that point. And with the SnapDragon series making up a significant proportion of flagship smartphones, the 865 could tell us a lot about the direction of Android in 2020.</p>
