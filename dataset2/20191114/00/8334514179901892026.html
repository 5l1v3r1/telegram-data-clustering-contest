      <p>DeGrom went 11-8 with a 2.43 ERA in 32 starts, striking out an NL-best 255 in 204 innings.</p>
      <p>He earned 29 of 30 first-place votes.</p>
      <p>“I said it was a dream to win one, but to win back-to-back, honestly, I’m kind of speechless right now,” he said on MLB Network.</p>
      <p>Verlander, 36, previously won in 2011, when he also took home the American League MVP award. He was 21-6 with a 2.58 ERA in 34 starts this season, striking out 300 for the first time in his career while pitching a major-league high 223 innings.</p>
      <p>“It’s truly incredible,” said Verlander, who led the majors in wins.</p>
      <p>“You know, 2011 was just a magical season, but I hadn’t really had to grind through much at that point in time. I lot has changed since then personally and professionally, but I think it just makes it that much sweeter.”</p>
      <p>For the first time in AL history, teammates finished first and second in the voting, with the Astros’ Gerrit Cole being a close second. Verlander picked up 17 first-place votes and 171 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers Association of America, with Cole earning the other 13 first-place nods and 159 points. No other pitcher placed second on any ballot.</p>
      <p>DeGrom, 31, is the first Mets pitcher to win in back-to-back seasons and the second in franchise history to win multiple times, joining Tom Seaver (1969, 1973, 1975). He started this season with a 3-6 record, but from that point in early June, he dropped his ERA from 3.45. He went at least seven innings in 19 starts over the season.</p>
      <p>“Last year, it was kind of smooth sailing all year,” deGrom said. “But this year, I had to kind of recover from that little rough patch and figure out a way to get it done and go out there and fix some mechanical things.”</p>
      <p>DeGrom becomes 11th pitcher to win in consecutive years, the last being Washington’s Max Scherzer in the National League in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Scherzer tied for second in this year’s voting with the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Hyun-Jin Ryu, who picked up the other first-place vote.</p>
      <p>Scherzer’s teammate on the World Series champion Nationals, Stephen Strasburg, tied for fourth with the St. Louis Cardinals’ Jack Flaherty.</p>
      <p>Verlander’s season included his third no-hitter — Sept. 1 at Toronto — and his 3,000th career strikeout.</p>
      <p>With Wednesday’s winners, there are now 21 pitchers that have won multiple Cy Young Awards.</p>
      <p>Verlander finally picked up his second trophy after finishing second in 2012, 2016 and 2018. He had narrow losses to David Price in 2012 and Rick Porcello in 2016.</p>
      <p>This time, he came out on top over Cole, who was 20-5 with a 2.50 ERA and a major-league-best 326 strikeouts in 212 1/3 innings.</p>
      <p>“Having come so close a couple of other times, just everything, all that this means, it’s just such an incredible feeling,” Verlander said.</p>

      <p>Charlie Morton of the Tampa Bay Rays was third, followed by the Cleveland Indians’ Shane Bieber and Lance Lynn of the Texas Rangers.</p>
      <p>Verlander is the fourth pitcher in Astros’ history to win the award, joining Dallas Keuchel (2015), Roger Clemens (2004) and Mike Scott (1986).</p>
