      <p>Kweku Baako Jnr has reacted to the NDC's call on Ghanaians to vote 'No' in the upcoming referendum which is going to be held on December 17.<br/><br/>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) led by its National Chairman, Samuel Ofosu Ampofo at a press conference said a <i>"YES" vote will further polarize the nation, particularly local communities along the lines of NPP / NDC, and will likely lead to the creation of “NDC Communal Labour day” and “NPP Communal Labour day”, as well as “NDC market” and “NPP market”.</i><br/><br/><i>"At the meeting held last Thursday, the NEC of the NDC affirmed our long-held position that MMDCEs should be elected. We however took the view that the local government system should remain non-partisan and that individuals contest the District Assembly and Unit Committee elections on their own merit. We, therefore, decided to campaign for a NO vote at the referendum and to urge all Ghanaians to vote NO at the referendum".</i><br/><br/>The Editor-in-Chief of the <b>New Crusading Guide</b> newspaper speaking in reaction to issues raised by the NDC on Wednesday's edition of '<b>Kokrokoo'</b> on <b>Peace FM</b> said: "<i>there is a certain element of bad faith on the part of the NDC on this matter. Suddenly they are asking people to go for an emphatic no relative to the referendum; it's so pronounced and sudden...it's looking as if there is a slight dichotomy between the party in parliament and the party outside in terms of how they perceived the processes. It looks as if there is a certain disconnect; there was something wrong with their communication and now the party which is supreme has taken charge...saying we are going for an emphatic 'no' and it has created serious complications."</i><br/><br/><b>Watch his submissions below</b></p>
