      <p>The UFC heads to Brazil on Saturday for UFC Fight Night 164. The ESPN+ streaming event, which is headlined by a light heavyweight matchup between Jan Blachowicz and Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza, marks the promotion’s final 2019 visit to Brazil. The bout is Souza’s debut at 205 pounds. Blachowicz is coming off a knockout win over former UFC middleweight champion Luke Rockhold, who was competing in his first light heavyweight contest.In the co-main event, ex-UFC light heavyweight champion Mauricio “Shogun” Rua, who has been competing since 2002 and a member of the UFC roster since September 2007, faces Paul Craig in a light heavyweight matchup. Craig has been fighting since 2013. Both fighters are coming off “Performance of the Night” bonus-inning stoppage victories.</p>
      <p>Before the five-fight main card, the UFC presents seven preliminary bouts on ESPN+. </p>
      <p>At the top of the preliminary card, Sergio Moraes, who is looking to avoid the first three-fight losing skid of his professional career, faces James Krause in a welterweight contest. Krause is on a five-fight winning streak. Krause, who has had success as a coach and trainer, is returning to the octagon for the first time since a knockout win over Warlley Alves in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Also on the prelims is ex-bantamweight champion Renan Barao. Barao has struggled mightily since he lost the title in 2014. He had a 32-fight unbeaten streak headed into his title defense against T.J. Dillashaw. Dillashaw won that contest by TKO in the fifth round. Barao is 2-7 in his past nine outings. He hasn’t secured a fighter since he defeated Phillipe Nover in September 2016. Barao faces Douglas Silva de Andrade in a featherweight matchup. Andrade began his career on a 23-fight unbeaten run. He is 3-3 since he joined the UFC and coming off a TKO loss to Petr Yan.</p>
