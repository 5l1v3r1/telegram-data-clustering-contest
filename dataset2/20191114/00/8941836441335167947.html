      <p>His mother, Priscilla Maldonado, says the cause is still unknown. As of now, doctors plan to leave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja/">Ja</a>’bari’s eyes alone.</p>
      <p>The surgery allowed lab-grown sheets of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja/">Ja</a>’bari’s skin to be transplanted onto the uncovered parts of his body. A Boston-area company that produces skin grafts for severely burned patients developed the skin from his biopsied cells.</p>

      <p>Maldonado says the procedure was remarkably successful. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ja/">Ja</a>’bari gained weight and color in his skin.</p>
