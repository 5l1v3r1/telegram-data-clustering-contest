      <h1>More than half of people who appealed being denied benefits by DWP won their case</h1>

      <p>More than half of people who took the government to court after losing out on benefits went on to win their case, data shows.</p>
      <p>Analysis of Freedom of Information responses shows that more than half a million people were wrongly denied disability benefits from 2013 to 2018.</p>
      <p>In the North East,<b> </b>68,269 people who had lost disability, sickness and incapacity benefits appealed against their decision at a tribunal and 34,930 suceeded.</p>
      <p>Charities have claimed that the figures show the government’s benefits tests were beset by "poor decision-making" and "obvious inaccuracies".</p>
      <p>Most of the appeals concerned Employment Support Allowance (ESA), which is paid to people who cannot work because of illness or disability; the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is paid to people with extra care or mobility needs; and Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which was introduced to replace DLA.</p>
      <p>Daphne Hall, the vice chair of the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers, said: "The reason for the high success rates [at tribunals]...is because of the poor assessments carried out by health professionals.</p>

      <p>"The DWP tend to base their decision purely on these assessments and disregard other evidence sent in by the claimant."</p>
      <p>Initial assessments are carried out on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions by the private companies Capita and the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos), which have come under criticism for scoring claimants too harshly.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Britain’s most senior tribunal judge, Sir Ernest Ryder, senior president of tribunals, also said the quality of evidence provided by the DWP was so poor it would be “wholly inadmissible”  in any other court.</p>
      <p>However, Capita and Maximus said the majority of people were satisfied with the process, and they were working with charities and disabled people’s organisations to improve their services.</p>
      <p>The figures gathered from the North East also show that the success rate for benefits appeals at tribunal has risen from 42% to 60% over the five-year period.</p>
      <p>When all types of benefits are considered, the success rate rose from 38% in 2013-14 to 58% in the period from April 2018-December 2018 with some 37,321 people successful over the period.</p>
      <p>Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter, the housing and anti-homelessness charity, said: "It seems obvious that the removal of funding for legal advice in welfare benefits matters has led to a steep drop in cases being brought to tribunal, as people are no longer able to obtain legal advice and obtain representation for the early stages of the appeal process.  </p>
      <p>"If someone is already struggling to navigate the labyrinthine benefits system, then they are probably going to struggle to navigate the courts system without help. Often people in these situations are already under a lot of stress and struggling to get by, without support it’s easy to get lost in the system.</p>
      <p>"Early advice is less costly and more efficient, and can fix problems before they are allowed to snowball. It’s very frustrating when we find ourselves helping people in court in situations that could have been resolved much earlier without the need for stressful and costly court proceedings."</p>
      <p>Rachel Logan, Law and Human Rights Programme Director at Amnesty International UK, said: "Amnesty’s own research before the LASPO review was announced made clear that the Government’s relentless cuts have left thousands of society’s most vulnerable people without essential legal advice and support, often denying them the rights they are entitled to.</p>
      <p>"Although this data is new to us, it would be no surprise that access to justice for those without deep pockets remains out of reach, or that LASPO continues to have a disproportionate impact on those most in need.</p>
      <p>"Legal aid is the bedrock of a society where everyone is able to secure their rights and challenge injustice. There needs to be an urgent change of direction if we are to avoid slipping further into a two-tier justice system that is causing an untold amount of harm to some of society’s most vulnerable people."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: "We are committed to ensuring people get the support they are entitled to and spend £55bn a year supporting disabled people and those with health conditions.</p>
      <p>"We have been improving the assessment process and just 4% of all ESA decisions and 5% of all PIP decisions are overturned at appeal."</p>
