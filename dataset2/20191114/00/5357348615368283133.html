        <b>THE Kingston Central Police are “actively investigating a break-in” at the popular Bashco store in downtown Kingston after criminals made off with an undisclosed amount of cash and electronics sometime between Tuesday night and daybreak on Wednesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deputy Superintendent of Police Dahlia Garrick, in charge of the constabulary's Corporate Communications Unit, speaking with the <b>Jamaica Observer </b>yesterday evening, said the incident occurred sometime between 7:15 pm the evening before and 6:30 am yesterday.</p>
      <p>“They gained access to the building by cutting a hole in a section of the roof, broke into the administrative office and gained access to a safe from which they stole an undetermined sum,” Garrick said. She said the individuals then went on to access the adjoining convenience store at the location, where they broke into the manager's office and stole two laptops before proceeding to another section of the building where they stole another “undetermined sum”.</p>
      <p>“The matter is now an active investigation being led by detectives from the Kingston Central Police Division,” Garrick told the <b>Observer</b>. She said the police were “following some leads” and intended to “actively pursue all leads”.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, early shoppers turning up to make their purchases at the store which normally opens at 8:30 am had to wait while investigators carried out their duties inside the store which was finally opened to the public some moments after 12.</p>
      <p>Store officials yesterday refused to speak about the incident but when the <b>Observer </b>visited a number of shoppers were in the aisles and at the checkout areas.</p>
      <p>Only last Thursday Minister of National Security Dr Horace Chang said the police would be intensifying safety and security measures in anticipation of increased activity during the Christmas holidays. He said this would see “a significant ramping up of police presence, particularly in the commercial districts and public spaces”.</p>
      <p>“This will be accompanied by other strategic, targeted and intelligence-driven security operations to bolster public safety, maintain public order, deter acquisitive and violent crimes, and further disrupt gangs,” Chang told a press conference at Jamaica House.</p>
      <p>Police Commissioner Major General Antony Anderson, speaking at the same event, said he had mandated the Jamaica Constabulary's divisional commanders to, not only focus on town centres, but also gangs, guns and criminal leaders (dons) over the next two months.</p>
