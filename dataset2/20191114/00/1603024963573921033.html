      <p>In a separate tweet, Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it "approves merger of the BNP Paribas Mutual Fund and the Baroda Mutual Fund".</p>
      <p>Bank of Baroda and BNP Paribas Asset Management in a joint statement in October had said they entered into binding agreements.</p>
      <p>The strategic alliance would allow both companies to leverage each other's strengths to offer products specially designed for retail and institutional clients in India, they had said.</p>
      <p>Baroda Asset Management is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda, while BNP Paribas Asset Management India is an entity of BNP Paribas Asset Management Asia.</p>
      <p>The regulator has also given nod to "secondary acquisition of additional 3.28 percent of the issued and paid up share capital of Delhivery Private Limited by SVF Doorbell (Cayman) Ltd".</p>
      <p>In February 2019, CCI had approved SVFD's subscription to compulsorily convertible preference shares amounting to 22.44 percent of the total shareholding of DPL (Delhivery Pvt Ltd) on a fully diluted basis.</p>
      <p>"Accordingly, subsequent to the investment, SVFD will hold up to approximately 25.72 percent the issued and paid up share capital of DPL on a fully diluted basis," CCI said.</p>
      <p>Further, in another tweet, the regulator approved "subscription to securities of Ecom Express Private Limited by CDC Group plc".</p>
      <p>CDC is a development finance institution, wholly owned by the UK government, which provides scarce and patient capital to private sector entrepreneurs in developing countries, the combination notice said.</p>
      <p>Besides, Ecom Express is engaged in third party logistics services including delivery services and e-KYC facilitation for the customers of banks, NBFCs and other companies that require such services among others, it added.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
