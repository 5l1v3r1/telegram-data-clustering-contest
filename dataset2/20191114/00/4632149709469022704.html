      <p><i>15 students pick on compatriot, extort money </i><br/><br/>A 22-year-old student from Kerala who was pursuing his Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree in a reputed private college has withdrawn his admission, after being allegedly ragged by his college mates. He has since returned to his home state. The ragging included physical harm, death threats and extortion according to a complaint filed by Al Ameen Anzari. <br/><br/>The incident is said to have happened a few days back and Anzari filed a criminal complaint against the accused on Monday. The victim who had sustained serious injuries after he was viciously attacked, filed the complaint on Monday when he had recovered from the injuries. <br/><br/>Anzari had joined East Point College of Higher Education located at Virgo Nagar in Avalahalli on August 27. <br/><br/>“When he was returning to his room around 5 pm after his first day in college, around 15 of the accused waylaid him and took him to one of their rooms. There they tortured him and made him stand till 10.30 pm and extorted Rs 3000 from him. Again on September 17th evening at around 6 pm, the accused are alleged to have called him on the phone asking him to meet them at one of their rooms. When he did not go, the accused are alleged to have pulled him to one of the rooms and threatened him for money,” said an officer based on the complaint by the victim. <br/><br/>In the complaint, the victim states that the accused had slapped him and pulled his beard. Unable to bear the pain, he broke down but they continued to tear his shirt and beat him, ignoring his pleas to be released. <br/><br/>“Two of the accused also hit him on the head with a wooden plank. When he tried to escape, they tried to strangle him. At this point, Anzari says in his complaint that he had started bleeding from his nose. He tried to escape again when they pushed him to the floor and dragged him. They threatened to kill him if complained about them,” the officer said. Fearing that his life was in danger, the victim reportedly returned to his home state and was admitted to a hospital in Kollam where he was treated for injuries. Anzari states in his complaint that the thrashing that he got from the wooden planks left him with clots in his head.</p>

      <p>– A police officer quoting from the complaint<br/><br/>“A notice is being served to the college seeking explanation about the ragging incident. The victim and the accused are all said to be from Kerala. Nobody has been arrested yet. The place where the alleged ragging happened is also being searched. The case is still under investigation,” the officer added. <br/><br/>After the incident, it is said that the matter came to the notice of the college management. The accused are said to be pursuing a course in Nursing in the same college. The accused are identified as Ameer, Rahil, Mubazil, Shahin, Musthafa and 10 others. Dr R Vijaya Baskaran, Principal, East Point College of Higher Education said that the victim had withdrawn his admission since the incident. “The incident reportedly happened a few days back and a high level enquiry was conducted. After the incident, the guardian and relatives of the victim came to the college. The students against whom the allegations were levelled are not with us now,” the principal added. <br/><br/>The principal said that he had no knowledge of the police complaint lodged by the victim. <br/><br/>A case of ragging under section 116 of the Karnataka Education Act of 1983, causing hurt (IPC 323), causing hurt by dangerous weapons (IPC 324), wrongful confinement (IPC 342), putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion (IPC 387), intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace (IPC 504), criminal intimidation (IPC 506) and unlawful assembly (IPC 149) has been registered against the accused. <br/><br/><b><u>RAGGING LAWS IN INDIA<br/></u></b><br/><i>Ragging has been the bane of college life but has been normalised to such a large extent that some students think of it as a right of passage, a ritual that will make them tough or gain them acceptance into college. Ragging has ranged from mild acts of serving tea and coffee to seniors to violence and sexual assault. Despite the regulations put in place by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2009 to curb ragging, UGC received 3022 complaints of ragging between 2013 to 2017, according to information presented in the Lok Sabha. In this period, the highest number of complaints came from Uttar Pradesh (461) followed by (357), West Bengal (337). From Karnataka, 139 complaints of ragging were recorded. Between 2015 and 2018 (March), of the 2,041 complaints received, in 871 cases students were punished and in 338 cases students were suspended, said Satya Pal Singh, minister of state, human resource development, told the Lok Sabha in April 2018.</i></p>
