The move is anticipated to allow Salesforce to optimize Marketing Cloud performance to meet increasing customer demands.</p>
      <p>In order to support their joint customers using Salesforce CRM and Microsoft Teams, Salesforce will also build new integrations for its Sales and Service clouds with Teams. The integrations will allow sales and service users to access Salesforce records directly in Teams, and is expected to go live in late 2020.</p>
