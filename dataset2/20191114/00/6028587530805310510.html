      <p>I finally got to personally experience LAX-it, the latest attempt to tame traffic at Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX. LAX-it is a new terminal to bus to ride-share vehicle system at LAX. The goal of <a href="https://www.flylax.com/lax-it">LAX-it</a> is to get the impenetrable traffic around the airport oval flowing and passengers out of the airport faster. (Think ‘LAX-exit’, not Brexit or <a href="https://www.ex-lax.com/index.shtml">ex-lax</a>.)</p>
      <p>With LAX-it, convenient airport pickups by Lyft, Uber and taxis would end. Instead, the curb lane was assigned to buses, which would circle the oval picking up passengers arriving at each terminal every five minutes during peak periods. Passengers and their luggage would take the buses around the airport oval until they arrive at the LAX-it lot, a 15-20 minute process. At the LAX-it lot, four lines of rideshare vehicles and taxis would wait for the passengers who booked them.</p>
      <p>Why the need for such a disruptive plan? LAX handled <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2019/2/6/18214094/lax-burbank-airport-how-busy-crowded-long-beach">87.5 million passengers</a> in 2018, almost 250,000 a day. That made it the world’s fourth-busiest airport, second-busiest in the United States after ATL. But unlike most world airports, LAX has no direct rail connection. All passengers must arrive or depart by road, leaving the airport oval consistently choked with traffic. Traffic engineers say the maximum number of cars LAX can handle is 100,000, an amount achieved every day as traffic spills into adjoining neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Initial implementation of LAX-it <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2019/11/01/unhappy-halloween-at-lax-as-new-rideshare-pickup-plan-creates-long-lines-hour-long-waits/#2ffea5ed7dac">did not go smoothly</a>. Some of the problems with “Carmaggadon” included confusion among passengers trying to figure out the new system, traffic gridlock, non-arriving or crowded shuttle buses, ride-share shortages and “<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/LAX-scrambles-to-fix-Carmaggedon-passenger-14811025.php#photo-18562287">inflated fares</a>.” Once passengers stepped off the packed buses into the LAX-it waiting lot (which Uber had warned was too small before launch) waits were often more than an hour. And the shortage of drivers led to surge pricing.</p>

      <p>However, the system looks like it may scale up in time for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2019/11/13/travel-tips-from-tsa-for-biggest-thanksgiving-airport--crowds-ever/#523a474b44e3">the Thanksgiving crush</a>, which the TSA predicts will be the biggest ever this year. When I arrived on November 8, the airport had already spent more than 10 days straightening things out. I also had another advantage. My flight arrived at Terminal One (Southwest) literally across the street from LAX-it. There was little LAX-it signage upstairs, but plenty at baggage level. And unusually for Los Angeles, there were plenty of airport employees around ready to help.</p>
      <p>As I had only a backpack and trusty roller bag, I skipped the bus. and skedaddled directly to the LAX-it lot, a five-minute walk via a wide sidewalk.</p>
      <p>Essentially a glorified, active parking lot, LAX-it does have both toilets and food trucks. There now seemed to be plenty of space for the rideshare line-up. But expanding the lot (as predicted, it the original layout was too small) required execution of a contingency plan for the takeover and shutdown of Park n’Fly. Park n’Fly’s let drivers park, exit the lot and walk towards Terminal One without waiting for a shuttle.</p>
      <p>Convenient and affordable, Park’ n’Fly was a secret of LAX I shared only with friends. Those who felt no such compunction gave Park n’Fly 4.6 stars based on 191 ratings. Joe S., in what was probably the last review, gave Park N’ Fly 5 out of 5. “Convenient location is just a short walk from Terminal 1. Hopped to and from my Southwest flights with ease. While drivers are always friendly, I really liked not having to take a shuttle.”</p>
      <p>But Park n’Fly was so last week. When I arrived at LAX-it, after ten minutes of confusion as to which Uber line to use, I checked the app. The same Uber X route that had cost me $27 (plus tip) from the Valley to the airport Monday now cost $67 (plus tip) on, Friday, almost 150% more . One of the many workers helping passengers said “Yeah there’s probably a little bit of surge pricing going on.”</p>
      <p>I had options. I could have checked Lyft or for a taxi. I could have tried to figure out where the low-cost (under $10 to Van Nuys, Hollywood, Long Beach or Union Station) <a href="https://www.flylax.com/en/flyaway-bus">FlyAway bus </a>was operating within the new alignment.</p>

      <p>Or I could simply have waited, gambling more rideshare drivers would show up and surge prices would drop. As I just wanted to get home, I did none of those things. I accepted the surge pricing and got a ride within 10 minutes. I had to find the car, then figure out how to match up the six-digit pin code I’d been sent with my driver’s number.</p>
      <p>The $67 plus tip fare seemed high, although similar to the $75 I’d paid for cabs before rideshares arrived. Similar surge pricing has been reported at LAX through the last month. But to be fair, it’s certainly possible that $67 for what proved to be a 70-minute 20-mile ride in heinously slow traffic, plus costs like $4 gas and depreciation, is closer to what the service actually cost than the $27 I paid to get to the airport.</p>
      <p>Surge pricing is apparently triggered by shortages of drivers, and traffic, wait time and wariness of the new system may still be keeping drivers out of the airport. Some drivers complained to me of long waits while they could be working elsewhere. Issues of ingress/egress (getting in and out of the lot) may have kept others away. A source said the industry also needs to incentivize drivers to complete trips at an airport that many see as a nightmare.</p>
      <p>So LAX-it is a work in progress, a stop-gap while the rebuilding of LAX lumbers along. Like the airport it serves, passengers and drivers will may not love LAX-it, but they will have to get used to it.</p>
