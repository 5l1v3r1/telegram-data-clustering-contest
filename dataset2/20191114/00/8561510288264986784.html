      <h1>Apple Exec: Kids With Chromebooks Are “Not Going to Succeed”</h1>

      <h3>Weird Flex</h3>
      <p>Phil Schiller, head of marketing at Apple, says that if you want a kid to succeed in school, they should <a href="https://futurism.com/apple-siri-hear-sex-acts-drug-deals">use an iPad</a> in class.</p>
      <p>Specifically, he was railing against the prevalence of Chromebook laptops in schools, arguing in an <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/">interview with <i>CNET</i></a> that his company’s product is better for keeping kids engaged than the competition’s.</p>
      <p>But still, arguing that not giving a student a specific computing device spells academic doom is a bit like saying a medieval torture rack provides just a bit of a stretch.</p>
      <h3>It’s A Computer</h3>
      <p>Schiller insisted that classroom technology must inspire kids if it’s to be effective — so far so good ­— but then he said that the iPad was the “ultimate tool” for kids to learn on and that Chromebooks aren’t able to keep kids engaged.</p>
      <p>“Chromebooks have gotten to the classroom because, frankly, they’re cheap testing tools for required testing,” he told <i>CNET</i>. “If all you want to do is test kids, well, maybe a cheap notebook will do that. But they’re not going to succeed.”</p>
      <p>It’s hard to describe this logic without delving into pointless sarcasm, but it bears noting how weird it is to see a company claim its products are the only ones that can help schoolchildren succeed.</p>
