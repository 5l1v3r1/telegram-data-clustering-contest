      <h3>With cooler weather arriving in Saskatoon, an annual clothing drive once again offered school kids free winter gear.</h3>
      <p>The Rock 102 Coats for Kids Campaign held its final event of the year Wednesday at Bishop Klein Community School, taking donated clothing and letting kids and school representatives select from among hundreds of coats, mitts and other winter items.</p>
      <p>The yearly event is done in conjunction with Care &amp; Share Saskatoon as a way to help make sure kids who might not otherwise have the right clothes don’t spend the winter feeling chilly.</p>
      <p>“With winter upon us, many children need warm coats, toques and mittens and this is an expense many families cannot afford,” Sandi Meldrum, Executive Director for Care &amp; Share said in a press release issued ahead of the event.</p>
