      <h3>A First Nation northeast of Saskatoon is reeling after the Saskatchewan Hockey Association voted to eliminate its two long-standing boys’ hockey teams and award the franchises to other communities.</h3>
      <p>That decision will be a blow not just to Beardy’s &amp; Okemasis Cree Nation, but also young Indigenous hockey players across Saskatchewan, say two people affiliated with the Beardy’s Blackhawks</p>
      <p>“The Beardy’s Blackhawks, we represent the First Nations of this province,” Blackhawks Minor Hockey Association (BMHA) spokesman Rick Gamble said in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“It means a lot to our First Nations in the province. A lot of these First Nations kids would never get a chance to play anywhere else,” Gamble said of the Beardy’s midget AA and midget AAA teams.</p>
      <p>Beardy’s Blackhawks manager Mel Parenteau, who has spent two decades with the club, said the opportunities to play on another midget AAA team would not have been there for many First Nations teenagers.</p>
      <p>“They would never have had a chance,” said Parenteau, who, like Gamble, expressed deep disappointment in the SHA’s decision to award the franchise to Warman, Sask., about 60 kilometres to the south.</p>
      <p>The SHA announced Tuesday that both the AA and AAA Beardy’s teams would move for the 2020-21 campaign following a review in which each of the 12 clubs in the league was asked to reapply for its position.</p>
      <p>Applications were due Oct. 1 and reviewed by an SHA task force. The Notre Dame Argos also failed to make the cut for the 2020-21 season, while the SHA awarded new teams to Warman and Estevan.</p>
      <p>According to a Nov. 12 memorandum published on the SHA website, that task force considered multiple criteria to determine the best location of each team and then made its recommendations to the SHA’s board of directors.</p>
      <p>SHA general manager Kelly McClintock said a broad review of minor hockey began three years ago, and all of the Midget AA and AAA teams in the province knew for two years the league would be effectively re-starting.</p>
      <p>The applications were judged based on the presence of a “strong minor hockey program” and billeting and education opportunities for players, and the 12 successful applicants “did a better job” of providing those, he said.</p>
      <p>McClintock declined to get into specifics, and emphasized that Beardy’s &amp; Okemasis’ is not the only franchise in the league with Indigenous players. Eight teams sent Indigenous players to a recent national tournament, he said.</p>
      <p>“I understand their disappointment. But we had to make a decision, what we see as best for all of hockey in the province,” he said.</p>
      <p>In a news release issued Wednesday morning, the BMHA described the AAA Blackhawks as a “one-of-a-kind” franchise, the only such team in the entire country that is located on and operated by a First Nation.</p>
      <p>“The only one. In this era of reconciliation, this team should be a point of pride, and a flagship franchise for a sport’s governing body like the SHA,” BMHA president Jason Seesequasis said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The AAA Blackhawks have been in place for 25 years, the AA Blackhawks even longer. Midget AAA is typically played by teenagers aged 15 to 17, and is the highest level of hockey beneath junior and the Western Hockey League.</p>
      <p>Garnet Eyahpaise, a former Beardy’s &amp; Okemasis chief, said he read the original proposal that created the team more than two decades ago, and watched as generations of Indigenous and non-Indigenous players came through the club.</p>
      <p>“We may be different colours but we’re playing for the same team, same jersey. Those things you can’t measure,” he said of how the club “broke down barriers” between people from around the province.</p>
      <p>Gamble said the team entered the review process in good faith and hoped no decision had been made before any vote was cast, despite he and Parenteau hearing rumours that the result was predetermined.</p>
      <p>McClintock denied that suggestion, saying the applications were evaluated fairly and there was no premeditated decision about which teams would be successful in re-entering the league.</p>
      <p>“There was no fix.”</p>
      <p>Gamble went on to say the BMHA is exploring its options, but that any appeal would be like “Attila the Hun going to the Vatican.” The association is also considering legal options, he added.</p>
      <p>McClintock said there is no way to appeal a decision made by the association’s board, and that it won’t be revisited.</p>
