      <p>Meanwhile, stronger US currency against its key rivals and surging crude oil prices capped the rupee's gains to some extent.</p>
      <p>The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, rose by 0.01 per cent to 98.38.</p>
      <p>Global crude oil benchmark Brent Futures surged 1.17 per cent to trade at USD 63.10 per barrel.</p>
      <p>Investors fretted over a host of negative factors like higher retail inflation print, weak IIP data and worries over US-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>After weak set of government data indicated deepening of economic slowdown, Moody's Investors Service lowering India's GDP growth forecast further hit investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>Moody's has slashed economic growth forecast to 5.6 per cent for 2019, saying government measures do not address the widespread weakness in consumption demand.</p>
      <p>"We have revised down our growth forecast for India. We now forecast slower real GDP growth of 5.6 per cent in 2019, from 7.4 per cent in 2018," it said. "India's economic slowdown is lasting longer than previously expected."</p>
      <p>Wholesale prices-based inflation eased further to 0.16 per cent in October, as against 0.33 per cent in September due to subdued prices of non-food articles and fall in prices of manufactured items, government data showed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, retail price based consumer inflation spiked to 16-month high of 4.62 per cent in October on costlier food items, reducing the headroom for a rate cut by the RBI in its monetary policy due next month.</p>
      <p>The industrial production shrank by 4.3 per cent in September, registering the weakest performance in seven years due to output decline in manufacturing, mining and electricity sectors.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors pulled out a net Rs 584.92 crore from Indian markets on Friday, according to exchange data.</p>
      <p>The 10-year government bond yield was down 0.18 per cent at 6.52 per cent.</p>
