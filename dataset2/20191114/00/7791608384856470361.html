This can be seen in its series of apps like <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/404687/Adobe-Debuts-Photoshop-For-iPad-Which-Can-Hold-Large-Files-Sans-Lag-In-Beta-Mode/">Photoshop for iPad</a> and a forthcoming <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/407203/Adobe-Will-Be-Launching-Illustrator-For-iPad-In-2020-Here-s-What-To-Expect/">Illustrator software</a> for the Apple tablet. <br/><b>Now, the company</b> is working on the ability to import photos directly from a memory card to the <a href="http://ow.ly/TEGu4?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Lightroom</a> photo-editing tool seamlessly. <br/><b>This will be extra</b> useful for those wishing to rely on their iPads more and not bring their laptops everywhere with them. The direct photo import feature is currently being tested by Adobe and will likely be available by the end of this year, per <i><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/ipad-photo-editing-will-get-better-with-lightroom-upgrade-coming-soon/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">CNET</a></i>. <br/><b>Adobe’s photography</b> product management leader Tom Hogarty shared with the tech news site that the feature has been a “long time coming,” and has been requested by users “for quite a while.” <br/><b>Hogarty showcased in</b> <a href="https://youtu.be/jGV9BbzjK3s?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">a video</a>, found below, on how the file system in iPadOS 13 and iOS 13 has been altered to enable the feature. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The Lightroom software</b> for iPad has always backed the desktop version as an accessory. However, this new update will allow the iPad to serve as a sole device for creatives to work on their projects. <br/><b>The Lightroom upgrade</b> will also arrive with the option to import photos from the iPhone’s camera roll and make simple edits through the iPad for online sharing. <br/><b>Check out the</b> sneak peek showcasing the long-awaited feature below.</p>
