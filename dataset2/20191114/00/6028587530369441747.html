      <p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191113005568/en/Sale-LORD-Corporation-Leads-1-Billion-Plus-Fund">Four research institutions will receive $261 million each, resulting from the sale of the LORD Corporation, a family-owned manufacturing company led by the late Thomas Lord.</a>Duke University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Southern California (USC) and the Cleveland Clinic are the beneficiaries of the LORD distribution, which is unique in the the history of higher education philanthropy for several reasons, including its overall size, the four-way distribution, and the fact that the gifts are unrestricted, meaning that the institutions can spend or invest the proceeds as they see fit.</p>
      <p>Each of the recipient institutions already had foundations that had been established by Lord in the 1980s, and they had received more than $200 million for research and other priorities up to the present time.</p>
      <p>After the LORD Corporation was purchased last month by the Parker Hannifin Corporation for $3.75 billion, the donation of the billion dollars was made possible to each of the institution’s foundations.</p>
      <p>Most large gifts to universities come with restrictions that mandate that the funds are spent in a manner specified by the donor and agreed to by the institution. Build a library or a stadium. Establish scholarships for a particular kind of student. Form a cancer institute. Or endow a professorship in the humanities, a chair in the sciences.</p>
      <p>The unrestricted nature of the Lord gifts makes them unusual and reflects a level of trust in the integrity and leadership of the institutions receiving them. They will allow institutional priorities to govern the use of the money rather than the personal preferences of the benefactor.</p>
      <p>According to reporting in the <i>Washington Post</i><i>, </i>USC Provost Charles Zukoski indicated that the university was looking to focus the money “around a narrow set of topics to have an enormous impact.” He suggested the possibility that fields like data science and artificial intelligence would be bolstered to address environmental issues or challenges confronting the big cities.</p>
      <p>Duke plans to plow the entire $261 million into its endowment, <a href="https://giving.duke.edu/ways-to-give/endowment/">which now stands at about $8.6 billion.</a> “The Lord Foundation’s exceptional support for Duke will transform our efforts to address the world’s most intractable problems,” <a href="https://today.duke.edu/2019/11/lordfoundation">said Duke President Vincent E. Price. </a>“From the foundation’s earliest investments in our Pratt School of Engineering to this truly visionary distribution, Tom Lord has left a lasting legacy on Duke’s campus, one that will continue to improve the lives of our students, faculty, staff and those who benefit from their work, for many decades to come.”</p>
      <p>The Cleveland Clinic will use the gift, the largest in its history, to support graduate and postgraduate education and to advance research in immunology, a field where the institution is already a recognized leader.</p>
      <p>MIT was considering several targets for the gift, according to <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2019/sale-lord-corporation-billion-education-research-1113">Provost Martin Schmidt, who said that the value of the gift was magnified because of its flexibility</a>. Likely priorities include support for graduate students, renovation of academic buildings, and supporting MIT’s study of climate change.</p>
      <p>It’s been a remarkable year for higher education philanthropy. The Lord bequest is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/11/08/the-wp-carey-foundation-makes-record-125-donation-to-the-university-of-pennsylvania-law-school/#1ce2a4e155a7">just the latest in nine-figure mega-gifts to colleges and universities during 2019</a>. And these donations come on the heels of a record year in 2018; charitable contributions to higher education <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/20/donations-colleges-are-number-donors-down">totaled $46.73 billion in 2018, a 7.2% increase</a> over the prior year, making it the highest level ever. </p>
