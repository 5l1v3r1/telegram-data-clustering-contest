      <p>ATLANTA (AP) — Former President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a> was already “up and walking” just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.</p>
      <p>The Rev. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tony-lowden/">Tony Lowden</a> of Maranatha Baptist Church visited <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a>, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“His spirits are good and he is up and walking,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tony-lowden/">Lowden</a> told reporters.</p>
      <p>Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a>’s Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain’s surface.</p>
      <p>She said he would remain hospitalized under observation. It’s unclear when he’ll be released.</p>

      <p>The center said the bleeding was connected to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a>’s recent falls. A Spring fall required <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tony-lowden/">Lowden</a> said he expects <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> to ask when can he resume teaching Sunday School. The former president has been teaching Sunday School regularly at Maranatha Baptist for decades.</p>

        <p>“I am going to tell him that we have everything in order at the church and he doesn’t have to worry about anything,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tony-lowden/">Lowden</a> said. “There is no need to rush.”</p>
