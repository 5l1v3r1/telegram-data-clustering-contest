      <p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gretchen-whitmer/">Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</a>’s administration is launching initiatives to cut opioid overdose deaths in half in five years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gretchen-whitmer/">Whitmer</a> and other top officials on Thursday announced a series of steps to combat an epidemic that has claimed more than 7,000 lives over five years.</p>
      <p>They include removing prior authorization requirements for opioid-treatment medicines in the Medicaid program and spending $1 million on advertising to reduce the stigma around addiction. The state also is expanding medication-assisted treatment in prisons and support for syringe-service programs.</p>
