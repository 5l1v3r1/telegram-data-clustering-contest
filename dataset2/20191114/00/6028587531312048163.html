      <p>As more and more original series players enter the television arena, it feels like the name of the game isn’t who can make the best show but who can land the best IP to help build their brand. And, while Spectrum Originals isn’t exactly a new player, it has been ramping up its original series production recently. First with <i>Bad Boys</i> spin-off <i>L.A.’s Finest </i>and now again with a revival of beloved sitcom <i>Mad About You</i>.Starring Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt in their respective roles as Paul and Jamie, the new <i>Mad About You</i> joins the loving couple on the day their daughter Mabel heads off to college at NYU. Now faced with the reality of an empty nest, Paul and Jamie must find new ways to keep their marriage, and selves, sane.</p>
      <p>While there’s nothing wrong with the new revival of <i>Mad About You</i> - it’s charming, mildly funny and carries the tone of a sitcom that never really left the 90s despite its odd depiction of tech use - there’s nothing that feels too necessary about it either. Ultimately, it’s another case of a revival happening because someone said “can we” rather than “should we?” Reiser and Hunt haven’t skipped a step in their long time away from the Buchman roles, but the show just feels like a needless exercise in television show rebooting.</p>
      <p>The only thing new brought to the table in the show is that of the couple’s now grown daughter Mabel who, while featured as a series regular, may have been better served as an occasional pop-in character to act as a foil in between misadventures among the couple themselves. The actress playing Mabel, Abby Quinn, like her veteran co-stars, is bringing plenty of enjoyable work to the table, but for what feels like an unneeded addition to the already unneeded series.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, what can be said about the new <i>Mad About You</i> is that it’s a fine revisit for fans of the original series, but not something that’s going to attract anyone new to the IP. The show does get an A for effort, as there’s nothing poor to put upon it, but that’s the only thing it gets an A for because, while being a fine series that isn’t going to bother anyone, it’s no less a pointless one to make.</p>

        <b><i>Mad About You</i> premieres Wednesday, November 20th on Spectrum Originals</b>
