      <p>T-Mobile is updating Samsung’s recent Galaxy S flagships this week.</p>
      <p>First up, the Galaxy S10, S10e, and S10+ are all receiving updates. The <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-s10/">Galaxy S10</a> is getting bumped up to version G973USQS2BSIX while the Galaxy S10e is moving to version G970USQS2BSIX and the Galaxy S10+ is being updated to version G975USQS2BSIX.</p>
      <p>The update changelogs for all three S10 series phones say that “The security of your device has been improved” and include the November 2019 security patch level. T-Mo says that an SSU network lock fix is included, too.</p>
      <p>TmoNews readers Daryl and Kevin received their Galaxy S10 updates over the air, so if you’ve got an S10 series phone, you should see an update on your device soon. If you’d like to check for your update manually, just launch the Settings app and tap on “Software update” followed by “Download updates manually”.</p>

      <p>Also being updated are the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+. Both phones are receiving the November 2019 Android security patches, less than two weeks after <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-pushes-software-update-samsung-galaxy-s9/">they last got a security update</a>.</p>
      <p>If you’ve got a Galaxy S9, be on the lookout for an update to version G960USQS7CSJ6. Galaxy S9+ owners should watch for an update to version G965USQS7CSJ6. You also have the option of checking for your update manually using the same method as on the Galaxy S10.</p>

        <i>Thanks, Daryl and Kevin!</i>
