      <h1>Do You Feel The Ground Shifting? Five Indicators That The Era Of Capitalism 2.0 May Be Closer Than You Think</h1>

      <p>In my work in movement building through the years, one thing has become clear: generally, you don’t recognize the early signs of a coming tipping point or a dramatic shift that is taking place. That is because smaller, incremental changes or actions often don’t get attention or aren’t as well understood in terms of the potential long-term impact that they collectively represent. Yet movements and societal shifts are actually the result of a series of these seemingly small acts that, when taken together, can represent powerful forward momentum that precedes a tipping point.Such just might be the case today as a landscape of the business sector reveals indicators that may signal that Capitalism 2.0, the idea that capitalism must be rethought to ensure it works for all while still retaining the benefits of a free-market system, is closer than you think.</p>

        <b>
          <u>A New Purpose For Business</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>This past August, while many Americans were enjoying time away or the more laid-back rhythm that summer often brings with it, it was easy to miss a single news story that holds the potential to radically alter the future of capitalism. The Business Roundtable, an influential association comprised of Fortune CEOs who run our nation’s largest companies, issued the release of a new Statement of Purpose of a Corporation. As a title, this sounds very technical—perhaps almost banal. And yet, one could argue that this singular action represents a tectonic shift in the history of capitalism in the United States.</p>
      <p>Why? Well, to best understand the significance of this move, we have to look back nearly 50 years. It was in a 1970 New York Times Magazine article that one of the nation’s most celebrated economists of the time, Milton Friedman, boldly declared, “There is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits” for its shareholders. In the same piece, he went on to argue that “social responsibility” was decidedly not the role of business. It was this singular focus and ethos that has largely defined the “purpose of business” as carried out by most corporate boards and CEOs for many decades.</p>
      <p>But the August move by the Business Roundtable that was signed by 181 corporate CEOs elegantly makes clear from the outset that the purpose of a corporation going forward will include providing value to all stakeholders, beyond the sole purpose of returning profits to shareholders: “Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity. We believe the free-market system is the best means of generating good jobs, a strong and sustainable economy, innovation, a healthy environment and economic opportunity for all.” And while at one level, this statement represents a radical shift for corporations and for capitalism, at another level, it is hard to read the sentiment without some sense of, “But of course!” </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there is a growing body of data to suggest that firms that are purpose-driven and serve larger stakeholder interests, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors beyond shareholders, are outperforming their counterparts who are still driven more singularly by shareholder profits. </p>
      <p>The Motley Fool summarized the benefits of a multi-stakeholder approach in May of this year stating, “When companies pursue a stakeholder-centric approach to value creation by incorporating ESG into their long-term investment strategy, they're able to attract the best talent, build loyal customer bases, prosper through strong corporate governance oversight, mitigate risk, and drive profitable growth by investing in sustainable innovations that positively impact the world.”</p>
      <p>In September of this year, a Fortune article entitled, <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/25/esg-investing-stocks-data-revolution/">Why Good Companies See Better Stock Returns</a>, reported a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research study concluded that “a strategy of buying stocks that ranked well on various ESG metrics—buying only the best-behaved companies, in other words—would have beaten the broader market by up to 3 percentage points a year over the past five years.”</p>
      <p>And for the skeptics who still fear what it means for businesses to go beyond the mere focus on profits, Harvard Business School Professor <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/harvard-business-school-professor-esg-will-overcome-a-stigma-to-succeed-51551445224">George Sarafeim writes in Barron’s</a>, “Even if you do not believe that ESG factors will improve performance, I haven’t seen any recent evidence that integrating material information about ESG will hurt performance.”</p>
      <p>As new data continues to emerge that analyzes the performance of companies who bring a multi-stakeholder approach, this new definition of business holds the potential to pay dividends beyond the societal benefits it brings with it and accelerate a path toward a new form of capitalism.</p>

        <b>
          <u>Growing Economic Impact of Women and Millennials</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The signs of the growing need for a multi-stakeholder approach are apparent to those paying close attention to societal shifts. For the last decade, for instance, The Case Foundation (where I serve as CEO) has been tracking the beliefs and perceptions of the millennial generation. Each year there has been a growing body of data that suggests millennials, the largest generation and workforce in American history, believe that capitalism should deliver more for society than it traditionally has. And over the last decade, CEOs have come to understand that to attract and retain the best and brightest talent from this generation, they have to look at the company’s larger role as corporate citizens. As women have grown to represent a more significant segment of the corporate workforce, they have brought similar sensibilities to decisions related to who they will work for and with what brands they want to be affiliated. These combined shifts in the demographic profile of workers are not lost on CEOs who understand talent is central to success.</p>
      <p>CEOs have also heard a growing cacophony of consumer voices from millennials and women, two segments that are paying closer attention to corporate actions than previous generations and who are quick to adjust brand choices based on corporate actions. Frankly, it just makes good business sense for these CEOs to be in touch with the elements driving their target consumer’s buying decisions. Just look at REI’s decision to close annually on Black Friday, urging its customers and employees to #OptOutside instead of shopping. CEO and president, Jerry Stritzke, sees the decision to stay closed on Black Friday as integral to helping the business succeed in a time when other retailers have been forced to close, saying it deepens their connection with the company and its membership model. And reports show it has helped REI’s bottom line. In 2015, the first year the company closed for Black Friday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rei-closes-for-black-friday-survives-retail-apocalypse-2018-10">REI posted its largest-ever membership growth, and it increased revenue by 9.3 percent to $2.4 billion</a>.</p>
      <p>And while it is easy to think of a millennial as a worker in a hoodie or a fresh college grad, the truth is that the oldest millennial is now nearly 40, many with new economic power they are wielding through investments they make. Here, too, they are joined by women, who have growing economic power of their own. Indeed, some data suggests a coming wealth transfer of tens of trillions of dollars to these segments of society—new capital ready to be deployed against a changing criteria for what they demand from the capital they invest. These are the segments that have moved from conscious consumers to conscious investors. Talk to wealth advisors and private banks and they will acknowledge that a large percentage of their female and millennial clients seek new opportunities to deploy their capital—investing in arenas where the capital can bring both a financial and a social return. The kinds of questions they are fielding from these growing segments of investors include corporate activities that touch on employment policies, environmental and sustainability practices, as well as diversity and inclusion, all signaling a shift in traditional investment analysis.</p>

        <b>
          <u>Burgeoning Impact Investing Movement</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>These new segments of investors are joined by a new generation of entrepreneurs who are building new companies that are impact-focused from their founding. Together, this new activity has led to the growth of the impact investing movement that includes companies and funds that provide both a financial and a social return. One example of this growing market segment includes the more than 3,000 Certified B Corporations, businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Corps are accelerating a global culture shift to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy. Their impact assessment tools for companies have been used by more than 50,000 companies around the world, a true sign of the growing trend among companies who are focused on impact and returns beyond profits.</p>
      <p>While still in its early days, impact investing is growing rapidly, with an estimated $502 billion in assets under management in 2018, doubling from $228 billion in 2017. Already at this scale, the market for impact investing is larger than the GDP than the vast majority of countries in the world, as reported by the International Monetary Fund. The year-over-year doubling we have seen of assets under management suggests that 2019 could tip the $1 trillion mark, a likely sign that a tipping point is within sight.</p>
      <p>The impact investing movement has been further spurred in recent years by big finance and marquee investors jumping in, including the largest firms in the world: BlackRock, Bain Capital, KKR and Apollo, along with big banks including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citibank and others.</p>
      <p>Popular brands are emerging in the impact space, as well. One example is Warby Parker, itself a Certified B Corporation, which has become a leading eyewear brand with a socially conscious mission. Their buy-a-pair, give-a-pair program has provided more than 5 million pairs of eyeglasses to someone in need and has demonstrated that building social impact into the model of a business from its founding can differentiate a brand and draw new generations of consumers to the business.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>A New Focus on the Long Term</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Another emerging sign that points to needed changes in the role of corporations is the Long Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), a new effort to build support for a long term, versus short term, focus on the part of companies. In recognition that the current quarter-to-quarter earnings that drive priorities and decision making by corporate CEOs and can often work against longer-term interests, the LTSE was approved by the SEC in May of 2019, and could see trading in the coming months.</p>
      <p>But there is a broader movement in the investor community, including the voice of the CEO of the largest asset management firm in the world, Larry Fink of BlackRock. In his annual letters to CEOs, he has emphasized the need to consider long-term interests and has become recognized for his leadership in encouraging boards to consider longer-term, multi-stakeholder approaches to increase the value of the enterprises they represent. This spotlight provides further support for other CEOs and boards to follow the lead of companies like Unilever and Salesforce, whose leadership has embraced this kind of thinking and showed investors, employees and customers that this long-term focus yields long-term benefits.</p>

          <u>Addressing the Failures of Capitalism </u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The consequences of the wealth and earnings gaps in America have resulted in some political platforms that call for a move away from free market policies of the past. The fundamental distrust that exists between citizens and consumers and major corporations today has opened the door to dialogue that includes draconian proposals. For some, the answer to the failures of capitalism is to reject capitalism altogether and strive for an entirely new economic structure that is more equitable and serves more Americans. But perhaps another path to a more inclusive economy is to recognize the unprecedented innovation and economic prosperity capitalism has enabled in the nation throughout our history, to fix the broken parts and build what some have called a Capitalism 2.0 that can work for all.</p>
      <p>In a world where a limited few now represent the combined net worth of billions of individuals on our planet, there is recognition that we can and must find a way to make capitalism work better for everyone. Many recognize that while the “American dream” stems from our free market policies and an enduring belief that anyone from anywhere should have a shot, the truth is that the dream is elusive to many across our society. While unemployment is at a historic low, the $1.5 trillion of student debt that the next generation is saddled with, combined with over-concentrated and siloed networks that can enable significant opportunities for success, means that Americans have come to recognize in a very personal way the idea that talent is universal, but opportunity is not.</p>
      <p>It is understandable to see why some across the country don’t believe capitalism has worked for them. Overall in America, new firms, or business startups are at a 40-year low. Yet research confirms that it is new business startups that provide the net new jobs in our country. There is both an economic and innovation imperative to look across society and across geographies, to get all the ideas and all the players on the field and to extend the opportunity to build new businesses to more segments of society. </p>
      <p>This idea requires a new approach to how investment capital is deployed, such as in the case of venture capital. Last year in America, venture capital–also known as the “jet fuel” for new firms that have high growth potential – was deployed in a very concentrated fashion.  In 2018, 79 percent of venture capital went to just three states: California, New York and Massachusetts. Our nation’s third largest state, Florida, received just 2 percent. And the data is more dire for women and people of color. Only 2 percent flowed to woman-led firms while less than 1 percent found its way to African American founders. We can, and must, find pathways to better diversify capital so that it can hold the same potential for innovation from more places and offer prosperity for more communities and more segments of society.</p>

          <u>Unleashing Business as a Powerful Force for Change</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>For too long, the role of business and capital has been narrowly defined as simply about the purpose of producing profits, leaving the broader responsibility for the well-being of our communities to either government or to nonprofit organizations. With shifting demographics in America and the country facing significant social, economic, environmental and political challenges, there are growing market forces that compel businesses to take on a broader set of interests to remain competitive. At the same time, we’re seeing new firms and new investors are bringing new types of enterprises forward that transparently integrate purpose and impact into the fundamental business model, all while retaining free market approaches to building value. Simultaneously, there is a building trend toward a focus on long versus short-term, driving business decision making and taking into account the broader needs of a larger set of stakeholders, beyond the sole interests of shareholders.</p>
      <p>As companies—young or old, large or small—begin to embrace the idea that their purpose includes making a profit for shareholders but also extends to considering the well-being of their employees, their community and the well-being of our planet, they can be unleashed as a powerful force for change. As we are seeing many of these elements come to life in different ways across this movement, there are signs that the era of Capitalism 2.0 may be dawning.</p>
