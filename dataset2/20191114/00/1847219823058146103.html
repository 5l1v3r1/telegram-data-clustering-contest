        <b>On Thursday, 14 November, Latvia’s Central Election Commission (CVK) registered a signature collection process initiated by <i>Varu Latijas Tautai</i> and <i>Centre Party</i> for the dismissal of the 13<sup>th</sup> Saeima.</b>
      </p>
      <p>«Voters will be able to vote on this initiative within 12 months at www.latvija.lv or by using services of a sworn notary, at the office of declaration of residence in the municipal administration, orphan court that performs notary service, or at the county or city management office. Signature collection will commence on Friday, 15 November and will last until 14 November 2020,» CEC explains.</p>
      <p>When deciding to register the initiative group, CEC made sure the applicants meet requirements of the Law on National Referendums and legislative initiatives and European Citizens’ Initiatives legislation.</p>
      <p>CEC also concluded that the day documents regarding registration of the initiative group were submitted, limitations in regards to initiating referendum for the Saeima’s dismissal, which are governed by Section 14 of the Constitution, were not yet in force. In accordance with the Constitution, the right to dissolve the Saeima cannot be used a year after the Saeima’s composition, a year prior to the end of the parliament’s term, the last six months of the state president’s term, as well as earlier than six months after the last referendum on the Saeima’s dismissal.</p>
      <p>Considering that both applications were submitted to CEC on the same day in regards to the same topic. CEC decided to register two initiative groups for the same initiative.</p>
      <p>The Constitution of the Republic of Latvia provides that no less than one-tenth of voters have to sign initiatives in favour of the Saeima’s dismissal for the idea to be legally approved. To use this right, it is necessary to register an initiative group with CEC. This group will need to collect and submit to CEC signatures of no less than one-tenth of the country’s population (154 865) within 12 months.</p>
      <p>If the necessary number of signatures is collected within the given period of time, a referendum on this topic is organized. In accordance with the Constitution, if the referendum results in the majority of residents voting in favour of the Saeima’s dismissal, the parliament is to be considered dismissed, as explained by CEC representatives.</p>
