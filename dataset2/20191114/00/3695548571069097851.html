        <b>Stewart-Haas Racing will promote its Xfinity Series driver Cole Custer to replace Daniel Suarez in its NASCAR Cup Series line-up for 2020, Autosport has learned.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sources have suggested the 21-year-old's deal will be officially announced within the coming week.</p>
      <p>A request for comment from a SHR spokesperson was not immediately returned.</p>
      <p>Custer is one of four drivers who will compete for the 2019 Xfinity title at Homestead this weekend.</p>
      <p>Suarez, the 2016 Xfinity Series champion, joined SHR this season in a one-year deal after losing his Joe Gibbs Racing seat to Martin Truex Jr.</p>

      <p>While he has shown flashes of competitiveness, Suarez failed to make the playoffs and so far this season has just four top-five finishes.</p>
      <p>SHR is retaining Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch and Clint Bowyer as the rest of its line-up.</p>
      <p>It is also beginning a technical partnership with the small Go Fas team for next season, with no driver allocated to that entry yet.</p>
