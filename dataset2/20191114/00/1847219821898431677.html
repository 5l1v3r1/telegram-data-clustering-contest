        <b>The United Kingdom is in a month’s time holding its early parliamentary election. The outgoing chairman of the EU’s European Council, Donald Tusk has said indirectly that the country’s divorce from the bloc can still be reversed.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/donald-tusks-message-to-uk-voters-dont-give-up-on-stopping-brexit">British news portal The Guardian reported</a> on Wednesday, November 13, that Tusk’s comments mark a break from the policy of EU chiefs steering clear of getting drawn into domestic political debates in member states during election periods.</p>
      <h3>«I want to tell you something I wouldn’t have dared to say a few months ago, as I could be fired for being too frank,» Tusk stated.</h3>
      <p>«The UK election takes place in one month. Can things still be turned around? [German-American journalist and philosopher – BNN] Hannah Arendt taught that things become irreversible only when people start to think so. So the only words that come to my mind today are simply: don’t give up. In this match, we have already had added time, now we are in extra time, perhaps it will even go to penalties?»</p>
      <p>The Guardian evaluated that Donald Tusk has given his implicit backing to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s and Conservative Party opponents in the general election with this call for anti-Brexit campaigners to keep fighting in the month before Britain goes to the polls.</p>
