      <p><b><i>Joker </i>will pass $1 billion worldwide on Friday or Saturday amid an otherwise miserable November slate, partially because three of the presumed-to-be-big November releases, <i>Wonder Woman 1984, No Time to Die </i>and <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>, fled to 2020. </b>This November has been disappointing to say the least. <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>opened below $30 million and last weekend saw the first November frame in 20 years without a $20 million Fri-Sun earner. I’d like to think that James Mangold’s <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>will pull in the demos who claim to want more star-driven, adult-skewing, aggressively old-school (and muscular) studio movie making to the tune of a $30 million-plus debut. And I’d like to think the fact that I’m not the only one who liked the new <i>Charlie’s Angels </i>means it might end up opening closer to $20 million than $10 million, or that the AARP-friendly movie stars (Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen) of <i>The Good Liar </i>could give WB a win in the adult drama department, but we’ll see. If not, well, next week will see the cold spell snapped by Walt Disney’s <i>Frozen 2.</i></p>
      <p><i>Joker </i>will essentially be the “big movie” of both October and November. It’ll pass $1 billion worldwide as early as tomorrow night (on the second anniversary of the overseas debut of <i>Justice League</i>, ironically enough) to become, once it passes the unadjusted $1.004 billion cume of <i>The Dark Knight</i>, the biggest global grosser ever to never play in China. As tempting as it is to look at the disappointing results for <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>, <i>Doctor Sleep </i>and (maybe, finger crossed) <i>Ford v Ferrari</i>,  right as everyone falls into the Disney+ wormhole of childhood nostalgia, and presume that it’s the end times for non-Disney theatricals, it’s slightly more complicated than that. One reason <i>Joker </i>has earned around $32.3 million domestic and $90 million overseas within the month of November is that its three chief rivals ended up ditching 2019 for release dates in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of reasons why <i>Joker </i>has legged out to a likely total of around $340 million domestic and $1.05 billion worldwide. But one big reason, which also explains why this November has been some a weak month for everyone else, is that three of the bigger/biggest movies slotted for November ended up vacating. We all discussed the underperformance of <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>when it opened on November 1, but it only opened on November 1 (instead of November 15) because Warner Bros. moved <i>Wonder Woman 1984 </i>to June 5, 2020. That was three years to the weekend as the first <i>Wonder Woman </i>movie, and as a result <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>tried to position itself as the big female-led action spectacular for the month. One DC Films flick got to leg out because the other one got a better release date.</p>

      <p>Last weekend saw painfully weak overall results, all due respect to the slight over performance of <i>Midway </i>($21.5 million over a Fri-Mon Veteran’s Day launch), but last weekend was supposed to be the opening for MGM and Universal’s <i>No Time to Die</i>. The 25<sup>th</sup> official 007 flick, again starring Daniel Craig, was supposed to open on the same early November slot where every 007 film, save for <i>Tomorrow Never Dies </i>(which opened concurrently with <i>Titanic </i>in December of 1997) had opened going back to <i>GoldenEye </i>in 1995. Alas, director swaps (with Cary Fukunaga stepping in for Danny Boyle) caused the release date to be pushed first to February 14, 2020 and then to April 3, 2020. <i>Wonder Woman 1984 </i>and <i>No Time To Die </i>would have both injected big bucks into the November box office and lessened the overall “Disney controls the market” narrative.</p>
      <p>With <i>Wonder Woman </i>ditching November 1 and then <i>No Time to Die </i>ditching November 8, <i>Dark Fate </i>and Sony’s <i>Charlie’s Angels </i>moved to November 1 before the Elizabeth Banks actioner moved to November 15 to avoid a head-to-head showdown. Oh, and Paramount’s <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>moved from November 15 to November 8. But, wait! Reactions to the first trailer and specifically the source-unfaithful designs of the title character caused the filmmakers to delay the movie until February 14, 2020 so they could offer a Sonic closer to his video game inspiration. So, <i>Sonic </i>went from November 15 to November 8 (the original <i>No Time to Die </i>release date) to February 14, 2020 (which was <i>No Time to Die</i>’s second release date). Even if it wouldn’t have pulled in <i>Detective Pikachu </i>numbers, I think <i>Sonic </i>would have played better than <i>Midway </i>and <i>Doctor Sleep</i>.</p>
      <p>I cannot presume that <i>Wonder Woman 1984 </i>would have earned the same (or better) as the $412.5 million domestic/$821 million worldwide grossed by the first <i>Wonder Woman</i>, nor can I presume that <i>No Time to Die </i>would have equaled or surpassed the $200 million domestic/$881 million global gross of <i>Spectre</i>. But even presuming some downturn, that’s an unholy amount of money, $1.4 billion to $2 billion even assuming <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>only pulled <i>Tomb Raider </i>numbers, that was supposed to be part of this month’s overall global box office. Since nothing of equal or greater value took their place, there was a huge hole in the overall marketplace. Yes, in a skewed way, <i>Wonder Woman 1984 </i>moving from November 1, 2019 to June 5, 2020 is part of what helped <i>Joker </i>cross $1 billion. Ditto the lack of the 007 actioner or the <i>Sonic </i>adaptation.</p>

      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate, Charlie’s Angels </i>and <i>Doctor Sleep </i>couldn’t come close to making up the difference, which was good for <i>Joker </i>but bad for the overall theatrical industry. We saw this before in 2014, when three big summer flicks (<i>Furious 7</i>, <i>The Good Dinosaur</i> and <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>) all moved to 2015, with nothing filling the void. <i>Maleficent </i>moved from July 4th weekend to late May. That was good for the Jolie flick, as it earned $242 million domestic and $758 million worldwide. But the lack of “big” movies from late-June to mid-July, especially with nothing big over July 4th weekend, coupled with <i>Transformers: Age of Extinction </i>“only” earning $240 million domestic from a $100 million, led to a comparative downturn from summer 2013. This led to months of “slump” talk. That’s what happens when you lose three surefire biggies with no relative replacements.</p>
      <p>The key difference between mid-summer 2014 and post-summer 2019 is that audiences are much less likely to go to the movies just to go to the movies. In the summer of 2014, it can be argued that Fox<i>’s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes </i>soared to $710 million worldwide both thanks to the popularity of <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes </i>($480 million in 2011) and because the under performance of <i>Transformers: Age of Extinction </i>(in North America, not overseas as the film topped $1 billion global) and the absence of <i>Furious 7 </i>in July made <i>Apes </i>the mega-movie for July. Ditto the absence of <i>Maleficent </i>(from July)<i> </i>and <i>Furious 7 </i>allowing Scarlett Johansson<i>’s Lucy </i>($460 million worldwide)<i> </i>to over perform. But in 2019, folks who otherwise would have seen <i>Wonder Woman 2 </i>or <i>James Bond 25 </i>just stayed home and binged streaming content.</p>
      <p>The delays of <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>, <i>No Time to Die </i>and <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>may be good for those individual films and, thus, good for Warner Bros., MGM/Universal and Paramount. But it resulted in a lack of “big” movies in November, with the marketplace essentially on hold between <i>Joker </i>on October 4 and <i>Frozen II </i>on November 22. It also means that a year of unprecedented Disney domination was made that much more possible by three potentially big non-Disney movies not adding to the year’s cumulative “not Disney” global box office totals. <i>Joker </i>will pass $1 billion tomorrow or Saturday partially because much of its competition flew the coop. When Sonic got a facelift, when Princess Diana decided to take her shot at being the biggest movie of the summer, and when James Bond decided to die another day, <i>Joker </i>and Disney ended up with the last laugh.</p>
