      <h1>Stewards of city's mental health strategy revealed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:48:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:48</time> by <a rel="author">Sammy Hudes</a></address>
      <p>A 21-member group will lead Calgary’s efforts to combat mental-heath and addictions issues as part of the city’s $25-million strategy.</p>
      <p>The Community Action on Mental Health and Addiction Stewardship Group was unveiled Wednesday, led by former Alberta Health Services CEO Dr. Chris Eagle and Karen Gosbee, whose late husband, George Gosbee, died by suicide in 2017.</p>
      <p>Others serving on the committee include Mayor Naheed Nenshi and city manager David Duckworth, along with AHS, Calgary police, education and business community representatives.</p>
      <p>The group will meet bimonthly, with a focus on “co-ordinating existing services throughout the city to build a made-in-Calgary strategy.”</p>
      <p>Their first meeting took place Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Eagle spoke Wednesday about his younger sister’s death by suicide in February.</p>
      <p>“She went through a system . . . and she fell through between the cracks,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Not because of any shortage of expertise or the passion of different organizations. She fell between the cracks because the system is not a mental-health system. It’s not an addictions system. It’s a series of component parts that don’t really work together and we can do much better than that.”</p>
      <p>A cardiac anesthesiologist, Eagle in 2017 <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/former-ahs-boss-takes-the-reins-of-health-care-fundraising-body">took the helm</a> of the Calgary Health Trust.</p>
      <p>The committee plans to set up a series of “collaboration circles,” designed to bring together diverse community members “to develop more holistic approaches,” according to the City of Calgary.</p>

      <p>Gosbee’s husband had been a respected Calgary businessman. But <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/altacorp-capital-announces-death-of-founder-george-gosbee">his 2017 death</a> at the age of 48 was met by disbelief throughout the city, she said.</p>
      <p>“He appeared to have everything,” said Gosbee.</p>
      <p>“In reality, the family and I had lived with that dark secret, the shroud of silence to protect my husband and (our children’s) father.”</p>
      <p>She said she hopes his story will serve as a “call for action” to help reduce the “shame and stigma” of mental-health issues. She said Calgarians need more “integrated and cohesive pathways” that allow people to navigate the mental health system more quickly and efficiently.</p>
      <p>Nenshi said he hopes the committee will develop a “Calgary model” to address mental-health issues that can serve as an example to other communities.</p>
      <p>“We are in an unprecedented crisis in our community,” the mayor said.</p>
      <p>“We continue to lose four, five, sometimes six people a week here in Calgary to opioid overdose; far, far more people than we lose to violent crime, than we lose to car crashes in our community every single day.”</p>
      <p>But he said Calgary also faces a “more silent” crisis, in which one in four people suffer from mental illness.</p>
      <p>“We don’t do a good job as a community on helping people stay alive and helping people get better,” said Nenshi.</p>
