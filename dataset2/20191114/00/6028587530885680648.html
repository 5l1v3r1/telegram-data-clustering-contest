      <p>A shooter opened fired in a Santa Clarita school, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles at 7am this morning. He was described as an Asian male wearing all black clothing. Several people were injured and at least two are in critical condition.The suspect initially avoided capture and was at large in the area. Area schools were put on lockdown and parents were warned to lock their doors. At 8:40am the sheriff’s department tweeted: “This is still a very active situation. Reports of approximately 5 victims being treated. Parents, deputies are on scene everywhere protecting your children.”</p>
      <p>The suspect was located shortly thereafter and the authorities reported that he is “no longer a threat.” It was initially unclear whether that meant the suspect has been apprehended or is dead. It has now been confirmed that the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>
      <p>It appears that there were no fatalities in the shootings. Little is known about the shooter’s motivations, what weapons he used, or the details of the attack.</p>
