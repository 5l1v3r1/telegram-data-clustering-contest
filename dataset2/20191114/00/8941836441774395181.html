      <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus’ president is vowing to go ahead with creating a national park in a largely untouched area of the tourism-reliant island, following a string of deliberately-set forest fires that were blamed on local landowners’ development plans.</p>
      <p>Nicos Anastasiades tweeted Thursday that such actions only make authorities more determined to protect and rehabilitate the remote northwestern Akamas Peninsula.</p>
      <p>Authorities say “premeditated arson attacks” on Wednesday burnt around 70 hectares (173 acres) of dense pine forest in the area.</p>
      <p>Police believe the fires may have been set by local residents who fear that declaring the area a national park will reduce property values and prevent land development.</p>

        <p>Anastasiades said any development “can and must” be in step with efforts to safeguard the peninsula’s environmental value.</p>
