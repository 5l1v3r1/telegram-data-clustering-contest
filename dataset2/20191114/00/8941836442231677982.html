      <h1>Marijuana legalization supported by two-thirds of Americans: Pew study</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/andrew-blake/" target="_blank">Andrew Blake</a></address>
      <p>Marijuana legalization is supported by roughly two-thirds of Americans, the results of a newly released Pew Research Center study showed Thursday.</p>
      <p>A survey conducted in September of more than 2,000 adults found that 67% of respondents said they think “the use of marijuana should be made legal,” Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/">reported</a>. Thirty-two percent answered no that question.</p>
      <p>That two-thirds supermajority is the largest ever recorded by Pew and up five percentage points from a similar survey the group conducted last year.</p>

      <p>The showing also marks a significant increase from less than a decade earlier. A survey conducted by Pew in 2010 found that only 41% of respondents said marijuana should be legalized, compared to 52% who answered to the contrary.</p>
      <p>When Pew’s pollsters asked a separate question that broke down the policy into medicinal and recreational categories, the results were a staggering 91% in favor of at least some form of legal marijuana use.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Roughly six-in-ten Americans — 59% — said marijuana should be legal for both medical and recreational use, according to the latest survey, while 32% said marijuana should be legal for medicinal use. Only 8% said pot use should not be legal under any circumstances, Pew reported.</p>
      <p>The results of the latest Pew survey are on par with recent reporting from other polling firms showing increased acceptance of the idea of legal marijuana. Gallup <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/oct/23/support-for-marijuana-legalization-steady-in-spite/">said</a> last month that 66% of respondents surveyed said they support making marijuana legal.</p>

        <p>Marijuana is classified a Schedule 1 drug under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and accordingly prohibited by federal law. Most states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation defying the federal prohibition, however. Thirty-three states have passed state laws legalizing medicinal marijuana, including 11 that permit adults to use marijuana for recreational purposes.</p>
