      <p>The long-running, groundbreaking animated series <i>The Simpsons</i> marked the start of its third season with “Stark Raving Dad”, an episode both initially popular and now controversial for its choice of guests–Michael Jackson. Now the show is available on Disney+, with one curious omission...<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-episode-featuring-michael-jackson-kept-disney-1254609"> “Stark Raving Dad” is unavailable</a>, with the third season beginning with “Mr. Lisa Goes To Washington”.In “Stark Raving Dad”, Jackson voiced Leon Kompowsky, a man Homer meets in a mental institution who curiously sounds exactly like–and claims to be–Michael Jackson. Jackson was never credited for the episode due to contractual issues, but the episode was sparked from Jackson himself. <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/the-simpsons-disney-plus-michael-jackson-1202189573/">A fan of the show</a>, he called creator Matt Groening and offered to do a guest appearance on the series.</p>
      <p>It isn’t the first time the episode has been pulled from circulation in recent memory. In March 2019, the episode was pulled from circulation after HBO’s <i>Leaving Neverland</i> documentary highlighted the singer’s dark history of molestation accusations by multiple men.</p>
      <p>Following the documentary, Simpsons producers opted to remove the episode from streaming and TV channels, with executive producer James L. Brooks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/08/michael-jackson-simpsons-episode-pulled-by-producers">declaring it</a> “the only choice to make”. He told the Wall Street Journal:</p>
      <p>“The guys I work with – where we spend our lives arguing over jokes – were of one mind on this. This was a treasured episode. There are a lot of great memories we have wrapped up in that one, and this certainly doesn’t allow them to remain... I’m against book-burning of any kind. But this is our book, and we’re allowed to take out a chapter.”</p>
      <p>Jackson’s estate has vehemently denied all allegations, and Disney+ has not yet commented on the episode’s exclusion. It is assumed that the omission follows the troubling documentary and its recent pulling.</p>

        <b>Disney Struggles To Address Past Controversy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since its streaming launch, Disney has made <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484470/disney-features-a-warning-on-some-of-its-older-content-with-outdated-cultural-depictions">several kinds of attempts</a> to address past content that is explicitly or subtly problematic, in whole or in part.</p>
      <p>A number of its earlier episodes, cartoon shorts, and animated features include in their description a warning that they “may contain outdated cultural depictions”. The warning sits alongside both well known controversial content, like <i>Dumbo</i> with its infamous and troubling crow scene, and with some older content that doesn’t really have evident issues. The policy seems to be a content-irrespective catch-all to cover bases regarding Disney’s early content.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Disney’s <i>Song of the South </i>is overtly omitted from the streaming service for having explicit <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468463/song-of-the-south-the-story-behind-the-disney-movie-that-disappeared?pv=search">racist content</a>. The 1946 film’s last theatrical release was in 1986, and it has never received a VHS or DVD home release.</p>
      <p>Disney is clearly attempting to find a satisfactory way to fairly incorporate its long-spanning content library, even when earlier content is acknowledged today to be inappropriate. In some cases, content is reclaimed with a fair warning, while other earlier content may be axed entirely–the policy Disney seems to implicitly be following with “Stark Raving Dad”.</p>
