      <p><i>The film, a multilingual, will go on floors in the middle of next year<br/></i><br/>Sudeep is all set to make a comeback as a director. The actor has directed six films so far starting with My Autograph in 2006. His last was Manikya in 2014. Sources privy to the development said that the new film will go on floors sometime in the middle of 2020. Work on the script will begun shortly after the plot was okayed a few weeks ago. Sudeep himself is likely to take an active part in the script development process, the source said. <br/><br/>Officially however, there is no confirmation about this development. While Sudeep remained silent, his manager said the focus is on the two upcoming films. While the actor is currently shooting for Kotigobba 3 for producer Soorappa Babu, two more of his films will be simultaneously launched in early 2020. One of these is Phantom, produced by A Manjunath and the other is a bilingual in Kannada and Telugu. <br/><br/>The film Sudeep is set to direct will start after the completion of Phantom and the bilingual. Sudeep had also written the story for Just Maath Maathalli which he directed. While his last film in Kannada Pailwaan was dubbed and released in multiple languages, the upcoming films are likely to have only a Kannada release. On the other hand big-budget films in other languages he has acted in are being released in Kannada. The 2020 film he is directing will however be for a bigger market. The film is likely to be made simultaneously in more than one language. The story therefore is one that suits the sensibilities of audience in all the languages, the source said.</p>
