      <p>Manhattan scammer Anna Delvey may have a girlfriend in prison, according to a new <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/12/fake-heiress-anna-sorokin-finds-love-in-prison/amp/">report from Page Six</a>.</p>
      <p>Though Delvey’s lawyer shot down rumours that Delvey had gotten married during her time at the Albion Correctional Facility, a source told <i>Page Six </i>that she claimed she had “some sort of girlfriend” during her time in Rikers Island jail. Whether or not the relationship is romantic is unclear, according to the source. </p>
      <p>Delvey (real name: Anna Sorokin) posed as a German heiress in order to scam<a href="https://refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/201794/anna-delvey-famous-friends-celebrities-she-knew"> friends in her New York City social circle </a>out of thousands of dollars. Labeled the “Soho grifter” by the press, she was<a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/230908/anna-delvey-found-guilty-grand-larceny"> found guilty of all charges against her</a> in April of 2019, including attempted grand larceny in the first degree and grand larceny in the second degree. The following month, she was <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/232272/anna-delvey-sorokin-court-sentence-prison-time">sentenced to four to 12 years in prison</a>. </p>
      <p>One of Delvey’s most notorious scams was against <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/my-misadventure-with-the-magician-of-manhattan"><i>Vanity Fair </i>photo editor Rachel DeLoache Williams,</a> who was invited on a trip to Morocco with Delvey and then obligated to put the entirety of the vacation on her credit card. Williams went on to write the book <i>My Friend Anna </i>about their relationship and how she was eventually conned out of her savings by the woman who claimed to have all the money in the world. </p>
      <p>While the real Delvey may be out of the public sphere, her myth around her story is about to get new life. <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/201401/shonda-rhimes-anna-delvey-netflix-show">Shonda Rhimes is producing Netflix series <i>Inventing Anna</i></a>, which chronicles the grifter’s time in Manhattan. A character seemingly based on Williams will be portrayed by <i>Scandal</i>’s Katie Lowes while <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/10/8663906/netflixs-anna-delvey-series-has-been-officially-perfectly-cast">Delvey will be played by <i>Ozark </i>star Julia Garner</a>. </p>
      <p>Given how skilled Delvey was at making friends in the elite NYC social scene, it’s not surprising that she may have found at <i>least</i> a platonic girlfriend behind bars.</p>
