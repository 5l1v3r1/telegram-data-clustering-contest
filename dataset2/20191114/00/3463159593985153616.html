      <p>The last-minute sales phase for the FIFA Club World Cup 2019™ presented by Alibaba Cloud starts online today, 14 November 2019. The final, the semi-final featuring Liverpool, and the double-header on 14 December were all in high demand during the Visa Presale phase, so fans who missed their first opportunity will have another shot via <a href="https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/organisation/ticketing/">FIFA.com/tickets</a> starting at 13:00 CET (15:00 in Doha).</p>
      <p>With less than a month to go until the opening whistle, inventory will be made available for all matches, including the final. Online sales will continue on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to availability, until the end of the tournament. A traffic light system on the Ticketing Portal, accessible via <a href="https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/organisation/ticketing/">FIFA.com/tickets</a>, will give an indication of ticket availability at any particular point in time. As additional tickets may be released on an ongoing basis, fans should monitor the system regularly.</p>
      <p>The opening match will be played between hosts <a href="https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/clubs/club/1933634/">Al-Sadd SC</a> and OFC champions <a href="https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/clubs/club/1952079/">Hienghène Sport</a> on 11 December at <a href="https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium/36097/">Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium</a>. The other qualified teams are Concacaf champions CF Monterrey, UEFA champions Liverpool FC, and CAF champions ES Tunis. The representatives of CONMEBOL and the AFC will be known on 23 and 24 November, respectively. Visit <a href="https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/matches/">FIFA.com</a> for the full match schedule.</p>
      <p>Tickets are affordably priced in three categories, ranging from QAR 25 for Category 3 tickets for the first three matchdays up to QAR 400 for Category 1 tickets for a double-header (a full overview is available <a href="https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/ticket-prices-x7974.pdf?cloudid=p5hxsta9rhrdzjdntzo5">here</a>). In cases where two matches are played on the same day at the same stadium (double-headers), each ticket will provide access to both matches.</p>
