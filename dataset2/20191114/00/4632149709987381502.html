      <p><i>De:Vision – The Underground Stage of the upcoming FiveSixZero music summit and festival will bring the best of techno, deep-house and tech-house musicians on stage. Here’s a sneak peek</i> <br/><br/><b>Shall Ocin </b><br/>At a very young age, Ocin started playing guitar and electric bass, and developed a fondness for 80s music and funk. By 1998, he had discovered the turntables and soon he set on the path to become a DJ. His contagious groove and knack for producing dance-friendly tracks took him to the clubs in Argentina, Spain, France, and Germany. In 2006, he decided to settle in Valencia, Spain, and produce his own music. Four years later, he released his first set of work under the name of Paneoh, and later worked up the charts on labels such as Bedrock and Connect Four. And now, after playing across the world, he’s coming to Bengaluru to headline the ‘De:Vision – The Underground Stage’ at the FiveSixZero fest. <br/><br/><b>Mia Mendi</b> <br/>It represents the artistic duo of James and Meti, who are taking the world of progressive house music by storm. Together, they churn out melancholic ambience, which is loaded with drums and modulating leads. Their esoteric production is beautifully sewn together with the threads of bedlam – made to move you through a string of sombre dreams. <br/><br/><br/><b>Ankytrixx </b><br/>A music devotee from the time he was a teenager, Ankit Kocher is a self-taught producer/DJ from India, popularly known as Ankytrixx in the electronic dance music circuit. His early listening years were shaped up by the works of John Digweed, Paul Oakenfold, Nick Warren and others. He ventured into the hottest clubs of Kolkata, Nepal and then Mumbai, where he moved to advance his career. The rest, as they say, is history. Now, with his company Ankytrixx &amp; Friends, he also spearheads programming weekend solutions for top-notch nightlife venues. In recent news, this livewire performer has emerged as a true international star, by joining a world-class DJ lineup that includes Sven Vath and Stephan Bodzin at Europe’s popular Ark Cruise fest. <br/><br/><i>Attend the music summit and fest from November 22 to 24, at The Lalit Ashok, Kumarakrupa Road, tickets on bookmyshow.com, details <br/>on fivesixzero.in</i> <br/><br/><b>To feature an event on this page, send the details and photographs to mybangaloremirror@timesgroup.com with the subject line ‘Unwind’</b></p>
