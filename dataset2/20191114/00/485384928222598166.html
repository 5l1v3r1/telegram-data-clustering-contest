      <p>For the past eight months, George Pell has been held at the Melbourne Assessment Prison, waiting to learn whether successive attempts to appeal against his child sex abuse convictions would be successful.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-13/george-pells-child-sex-abuse-appeal-bid-high-court-ruling/11695564">Wednesday morning, the <b>High Court of Australia agreed to refer his appeal bid to a</b> <b>full bench of the court's seven justices</b></a>.</p>
      <p>So what happens now?</p>
      <p>Wednesday's court decision is only a partial win for the <b>78-year-old former adviser to the Pope</b>.</p>
      <p>In a twist, the High Court did not formally grant Pell special leave to appeal against his conviction, it simply agreed to hear (in front of the full court bench) arguments for and against his conviction.</p>
      <h3>So what does the decision actually mean?</h3>
      <p>The move is not uncommon, but effectively requires all parties to prepare and argue their cases before the seven judges of Australia's highest court.</p>
      <p>Pell's lawyers will now need to say why his conviction should be overturned, while the defence will have to mount a case in support of the Victorian Court of Appeal's <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-18/what-is-next-for-cardinal-pell/11521418">previous ruling, which upheld the convictions</a>.</p>
      <p>The High Court <b>will rule on whether Pell has the right to appeal at the same time as it hands down its decision on whether or not his appeal has been successful</b>.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Gans, a Professor at the Melbourne Law School, said it was possible the court could disallow the appeal partway through hearings next year.</p>
      <p>"It's still possible down the track, part way through the appeal, that they might decide 'we've heard enough, we don't need to hear anymore, we're not going to hear your case'," he said.</p>
      <p>"But the most likely case is they will decide the case one way or the other."</p>
      <h3>When will the appeal start?</h3>
      <p>George Pell may have to wait some time yet to know his fate.</p>
      <p>The next step is for the court to set a timetable for the parties to file their submissions in the case, to be published on the internet.</p>
      <p>But the High Court is unlikely to run any hearing until <b>well into next year</b>.</p>

      <p>"There will be about a day-long hearing in the High Court, probably in Canberra, and each side will have a couple of hours to make their arguments," Professor Gans said.</p>
      <p>"The most important part of the day is [that] the judges will get to ask lots of questions to clarify the argument and, for those of us who are listening, to guess which way they're going to go."</p>
      <p>Professor Gans said it was possible the court could reach a decision at the end of that first hearing.</p>
      <p>"But more likely they'll say 'we're going to think about this' and they'll reach a decision in the middle of next year."</p>
      <h3>Will Pell be given bail?</h3>
      <p>Pell can apply for bail if he wants.</p>
      <p>"His best argument, if he does apply, is he's an old man, he's potentially in poor health, he's in danger in the prison or has to be subject to really strict regimes to keep him safe and he's only got a few years left before he's eligible for parole," Professor Gans said.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal did not apply for bail when his case was before the Victorian Court of Appeal.</p>
      <h3>Didn't he already lose an appeal?</h3>
      <p>The Cardinal was <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-26/george-pell-guilty-child-sexual-abuse-court-trial/10837564">originally found guilty by a jury in the Victorian Supreme Court</a>.</p>
      <p>He took the matter to the state's Court of Appeal, where he lost again.</p>
      <p>Two judges, Justices Anne Ferguson and Chris Maxwell, found the jury's verdicts convicting Pell of the five charges against the two choirboys were reasonable.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-22/george-pell-appeal-judge-mark-weinberg-wanted-to-acquit-cardinal/11437306">the third judge, Justice Mark Weinberg, disagreed</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Justice Weinberg found discrepancies in the evidence of the complainant, which left him with a doubt about Pell's guilt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Having lost in the lower courts, the only avenue of appeal left was the High Court.</b>
      </p>
      <p>His lawyers could base their High Court appeal on Justice Weinberg's dissenting ruling.</p>
      <h3>What will they argue?</h3>
      <p>The High Court won't be revisiting whether or not the original jury was correct in its conviction of Pell, but <b>whether the Court of Appeal made the right decision when it upheld those convictions</b>.</p>
      <p>"The difference now is the High Court will read, like everyone else did, the two judgments — the majority and the dissent in the Court of Appeal — and they can decide which of them got it right," Professor Gans said.</p>
      <p>"There's another possibility — they could decide neither of them got it quite right and come up with a judgment of their own.</p>
      <p>"It's not a change in arguments, it's just that the issue has moved on to not 'did the jury do its job properly' but 'did the Court of Appeal do its job properly'."</p>
      <h3>Is this definitely the final avenue of appeal?</h3>
      <p>Yes, this is <b>Pell's final chance</b> to be freed from prison and clear his name.</p>
      <p>If he succeeds in his appeal, he will walk free, no longer a convicted child sex abuser.</p>
      <p>"On the other hand if they dismiss his appeal he stays in prison until he's at least 80 and he will live and die a convicted sex offender," Professor Gans said.</p>
      <p>"So that's the stakes."</p>
      <h3>Why is Pell still a Cardinal?</h3>
      <p>Pell is the most senior member of the Catholic Church to be convicted of child sexual abuse, leaving the Vatican in uncharted waters.</p>

      <p>The Holy See's <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-19/george-pell-and-the-vatican-organisation-investigating-him/11455530"><b>Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is investigating Pell</b></a><b> </b>in a process that could lead to him being laicised, more commonly referred to as defrocked.</p>
      <p>It's common for the Catholic Church to wait for criminal proceedings to be over and so far the Vatican has been unwilling to discuss what action it would take against Pell.</p>
      <p>Only one other cardinal in history — <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-17/former-us-cardinal-defrocked-for-sex-crimes/10819596">Theodore McCarrick — has been laicised but there were no criminal proceedings in that case</a>.</p>
      <p>The church's investigations are often viewed as 'clandestine' as it's all done behind closed doors.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, even priests who are defrocked by the church remain priests, according to the Catholic belief.</p>
      <h3>Is Pell likely to appear in the High Court?</h3>
      <p>When the hearing is held next year George Pell will have to rely on his lawyers to keep him posted, as <b>he won't be appearing in the court</b>.</p>
      <p>Most High Court cases are heard over one or two days, before the court reserves its decision, and delivers a ruling when it is ready.</p>
      <p>The High Court doesn't often do things in a rush, but when it acts its decisions are clear and final.</p>
