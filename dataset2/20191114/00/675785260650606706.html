      <h1>Join The Woodland Trust's Big Climate Fightback by planting a tree on November 30</h1>
      <h2>The UK’s largest woodland conservation charity wants to get 1 million people to pledge to take part</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Masters, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/dave-masters/</a></address>
      <p>We think of Britain as a green and pleasant land, but it’s nothing like as leafy as it should be. The UK’s woodland cover is around 13 per cent. The average across the eU is closer to 37 per cent.</p>
      <p>There are lots of reasons why this is. Wood has always been valuable as a building material – for ancient homes, as well as furniture and even Admiral Nelson’s ships, for example.</p>
      <p>During the two World Wars, much of our precious woodland was lost because it was so hard to import materials, so we had to use what we had. Today, cities are increasingly bursting their green belts as more and more of us need places to live.</p>
      <p>But it’s not just sentiment that makes us want to see more trees in Britain. Apart from woodland being an attractive place to spend time, there’s a practical benefit that comes from trees, too.</p>

      <p>According to 2017 figures from the Office for National Statistics, the removal of air pollution through plant life, mainly trees, has added a total of 1,238 years to people’s lives.</p>
      <p>But poor planting rates mean that rather than more trees, we’re experiencing net deforestation, with huge areas being felled but not replanted.</p>
      <p>It’s time to fight back.</p>
      <p>The UK’s largest woodland conservation charity, the Woodland Trust, is leading the Big Climate Fightback, an initiative to get as many people as possible planting trees to combat climate change, as well as air pollution.</p>

      <p>Climate change seems like a huge and complex issue and it’s hard to see how one person can help. But if we all act together we can make a real difference.</p>
      <p>Swiss university ETH Zürich says a worldwide planting programme could remove two-thirds of all the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere today.</p>
      <p>No one stands up for woods and trees in the UK like the Woodland Trust. By 2025, the charity aims to have planted a tree for every person in Britain.</p>
      <h3>Here's how to play your part</h3>

      <p>The Woodland Trust wants to mobilise 1million people to pledge to plant a tree on November 30. You can be one of them.</p>
      <p>If you can’t find somewhere to plant a tree, you can still get involved – you can support the Woodland Trust by becoming a member from just £4 a month or make a donation towards the trust’s work of planting and protecting trees all over the UK.</p>
      <p>The Woodland Trust will be leading the fight by hosting public tree planting across the UK on November 30. There will be at least one event in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales and at least five events across England – check the Woodland Trust website (see below) for your nearest one!</p>
      <p>Every single tree counts. If you can plant a tree, or get involved in any way, you will have been part of a change. You’ll literally be one in a million.</p>
      <p>Years from now, when your kids – or theirs – ask you what you did in the great fight against climate change, you can tell them that you were part of the team that helped to save the world.</p>
