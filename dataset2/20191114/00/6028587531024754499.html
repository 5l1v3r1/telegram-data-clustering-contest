      <p><i>By Jennifer Brunton</i>Thanksgiving is a kitchen-intensive holiday—but all that time spent fixing a magnificent meal can get in the way of spending time with your loved ones. One way to optimize your time is to have your Thanksgiving feast delivered. </p>
      <p>The following five offerings from mail-order food purveyors definitely cover the basics—turkey, plenty of sides and dessert. But they also take things to a level that will satisfy the most serious foodies.</p>
      <p>Each meal package is available nationwide. There is some light prep involved, but each meal package has clear instructions. So you'll still have plenty of time for football, the parade and other Thanksgiving traditions.</p>
