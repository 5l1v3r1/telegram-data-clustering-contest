      <p>Prosperity, it seems, is perpetually under threat. These days, the China-U.S. trade dispute seems the most likely source of danger. Even before it had much effect on trade, it had unhinged confidence in future sales and, in the process, discouraged hiring and capital spending throughout most of the developed world from Topeka to Stuttgart to Shanghai. Tariffs have limited sales of Chinese goods in America and visa versa, and the economic shortfall, in China especially, has hit the sale of German machinery and Japanese parts. If these matters have not yet created a global recession, they point in that direction, unless, or until, Beijing and Washington can agree. Both sides, however, are running out of time.To a greater or lesser degree, signs of just such trade-based trouble have appeared the world over. China lies at its epicenter.  America’s tariffs have hit hard there and understandably so, since some 5% of that economy depends on exports to the United States. Even under the always-optimistic bias of Beijing’s official statistics, reports show how growth in China has slowed to rates not seen in decades. Hiring has dropped, too. By some measures want ads for technology jobs have fallen 20%. To avoid the American levies, production facilities have decamped China for locations elsewhere in Asia. The yuan’s devaluation has helped keep exports up by reducing the dollar price of Chinese goods on global markets by about the amount of the tariffs, but the tactic has denied Chinese produces of the full dollar return on their sales. President Trump is right in this regard: Chinese producers effectively are paying the tariffs for American buyers.</p>
      <p>China’s pain shows elsewhere as well. Chinese producers have cut back on capital spending and other expansion plans, and that decision has hurt especially German and Japanese exports. According to World Bank figures, some 9% of German exports go to China as do almost 20% of Japanese exports, much of it machinery and industrial supplies as well as technology. The world still awaits German economic figures for the last quarter, but indicators are that they could show a contraction, certainly for industry if not yet the whole economy. After all, Germany’s manufacturing index has been in decline since 2018 and this past September hit its lowest level in more than a decade. Japan already has all but fallen into recession. Real gross domestic product there for this year so far shows a negligible advance. To be sure, Japan’s problems go beyond trade, but the drop in sales to China has certainly contributed and in a major way to these economic troubles. Similar effects have become apparent in Korea and Taiwan, economies that depend on China and Japan, too. Meanwhile Singapore, a major trading nation and something of a bell-weather for the global and certainly the Asian economy, appears to have suffered an economic contraction.</p>
      <p>The United States so far has avoided the downward push of these forces. It never had as much at stake in this contest as China.  Only some 1% of this country’s GDP depends on China trade. Because China has allowed its yuan to fall in value against the dollar neither American consumers nor businesses bear the higher costs that the tariffs would otherwise have imposed. Meanwhile, high levels of employment and rising real wages have supported consumer spending, still some 70% of the economy, and that has propelled the economy upward. Nonetheless, the business community has already pulled back for fear of what the trade war could do over the longer term. At last measure, the Commerce Department reports that orders for non-defense capital goods have declined almost 5% from year ago levels. The recent slowdown in the pace of employment growth may also reflect such caution, though it clearly also reflects a shortage of adequately trained labor. If there is little sign of an American recession yet, it is also true that this country cannot grow indefinitely while the rest of the world declines.</p>
      <p>If the solution to all this pain and potential loss lies with a U.S.-China trade agreement, the state of negotiations leaves only ambiguous prospects. Both sides certainly want an agreement. China wants an end to the economic pressure and Washington wants to erase the chance of recession. The recent truce arranged by China and the United States in this standoff relieves some pressure but not the underlying issues.  </p>
      <p>The sticking points from the American side are assurances for Beijing that it will end two practices. One is the theft of corporate secrets, especially technology. The other is China’s long-standing insistence that any foreign firm operating in China have a Chinese partner to whom it must transfer all technology and commercial secrets. These are old complaints by the United States. China has offered informal assurances about these matters to every president going back to Bill Clinton at least. Because Beijing has reneged every time, the Trump administration is demanding a more formal change in Chinese law. Beijing’s sticking point is that such demands insult its sovereignty.  </p>
      <p>Whether the sides can manage some diplomatic formula to bridge this gap remains highly uncertain. Both Washington and Beijing have powerful incentives in the building economic pressure. But they are clearly running out of time. They likely have only 6-9 months left to reach an agreement before the recessionary effects appear even in the United States.</p>
