      <h1>Matthew Dowd, ABC analyst, vows to ‘be better’ after tweet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>ABC News chief political analyst Matthew Dowd apologized Wednesday after many interpreted his tweet criticizing Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik as sexist.</p>
      <p>“Elise Stefanik is a perfect example of why just electing someone because they are a woman or a millennial doesn’t necessarily get you the leaders we need,” Mr. Dowd wrote in a now-deleted tweet.</p>
      <p>The comment drew a flurry of angry responses accusing the chief analyst of sexism and political bias. Ms. Stefanik, a 35-year-old Harvard graduate from New York, said the tweet gave a prime example of why many women don’t run for public office.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dowd later deleted the tweet and apologized, not for the tweet’s content but for the way it was “misconstrued.”</p>
      <p>“I think people are misunderstand [<i>sic</i>] my tweet. So I will delete,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewjdowd/status/1194729308952109058">wrote</a>. “I am saying just saying we need more millennials or more women isn’t going to solve the problem of needing more leaders with integrity. Vote integrity no matter what.</p>

      <p>“Hey @EliseStefanik I just want to apologize for a tweet that is being misinterpreted,” he continued. “I didn’t mean to suggest you were elected only because you were a woman or a millennial. I deleted the tweet.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Dowd added that he has been “one of the biggest advocates” of women in politics but promised to “be better” with his wording moving forward.</p>
      <p>“I was suggesting people that merely advocate for more women or more whatever group without also asking for other leadership qualities miss the point,” he wrote. “We need leaders with integrity. Women men people of color. Millennials. Etc.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Stefanik responded by accepting Mr. Dowd’s apology, but added ABC News should be “ashamed” of what he wrote.</p>

        <p>“Apology accepted @matthewjdowd,” she tweeted. “@ABCPolitics should be ashamed of your comment. This is one of the reasons young women don’t run for office.”</p>
        <p>She later reacted with glee after being reminded by a Twitter follower that she helped provide research for a book Mr. Dowd co-authored during her Harvard days.</p>
        <p>“Hahahhah OMG Thank you for reminding me of this!” the congresswoman replied. “I had forgotten that Dowd was involved.”</p>
