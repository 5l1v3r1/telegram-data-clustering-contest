      <p>Six years have passed since <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frozen_2013">Frozen</a> </i>became one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons of the decade (maybe of all time?). Now Disney has finally made a sequel with the same team involved, and it’s sure to be one of the biggest movies of the year (maybe of all time?).</p>
      <p>But is <i><b><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frozen_ii">Frozen II</a></b> </i>worth the wait, or is it just a pointless cash grab? The first reviews of the follow-up aren’t as enthusiastic as they were for its predecessor, but most critics agree it’s a worthy new adventure that should dazzle fans with its stunning animation, laugh-out-loud humor, and fun soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Here’s what critics are saying about <i>Frozen II</i>:</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>How does the sequel compare to the original?</h3>
      <blockquote>“The sequel is not only better than the 2013 original, but it also improves the original film by adding to its mythology and shining a light on the events of that story in a whole new way.” – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii-1839780988">Germain Lussier, io9</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen II</i> is nominally a slight improvement on its predecessor.” – <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/frozen-2-review/">Josh Spiegel, Slashfilm</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen II</i> is as magical as its predecessor.” – <a href="http://www.solzyatthemovies.com/2019/11/14/frozen-2-goes-into-the-unknown/">Danielle Solzman, Solzy at the Movies</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“It’s a sequel that stands toe-to-toe with the original, which isn’t exactly an easy feat to accomplish.” – <a href="http://shakefire.com/review/frozen-2">Matt Rodriguez, Shakefire</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“If it doesn’t <i>quite</i> match the original, it comes very, very close.” – <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29786453/frozen-2-review-disney-release-date/">Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The film itself is a satisfying but very familiar retread of the first movie.” – <a href="https://screencrush.com/frozen-2-review/">Matt Singer, ScreenCrush</a></blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <h3>And how does it compare to other Disney sequels?</h3>
      <blockquote>“It carries the same lackluster energy of one of Disney’s direct-to-video sequels from times past: 1998’s <i>Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride</i>, or 1994’s <i>The Return of Jafar</i>.” – <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/frozen-2/">David Jenkins, Little White Lies</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen 2</i> gives off the same lackluster dimness that hand-drawn direct-to-video sequels like <i>Return of Jafar</i> and <i>Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas</i> did back in their humbler day.” – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/frozen-2-disney-review">Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair</a></blockquote>

      <h3>Will fans enjoy it?</h3>
      <blockquote>“The characters and music plus the gorgeous visuals are enough to make <i>Frozen II</i> a fun film even if it has none of the staying power of its predecessor.” – <a href="https://collider.com/frozen-2-review-kristen-bell/">Matt Goldberg, Collider</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen II </i>is anything but a mindless remake. Ironically, <i>Frozen</i> fans may secretly be wishing for a more straightforward rehash.” –  <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/frozen-2-review-frozen-ii-1203404683/">Peter Debruge, Variety</a></blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Is the new story worth the wait?</h3>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen 2</i> is crammed with material, most of which works.” – <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/frozen-2-review-sequel-disney-1202189123/">Kate Erbland, IndieWire</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The mythology is somehow both overly complicated and oddly perfunctory. Really, the plot is mainly an excuse for the characters to hang out. And why not?” – <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-14/frozen-2-review-disney-elsa-anna-olaf">Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The <i>Frozen</i> team is forced to go bigger, grander, more existential, while still keeping things accessible to children. That’s a really tough balancing act, one <i>Frozen 2</i> can’t manage.” – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/frozen-2-disney-review">Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“A lot goes on but nothing really happens…the only surprising thing about this film is how complex and contrived it is.” – <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/frozen-2/">David Jenkins, Little White Lies</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Here’s the one problem with <i>Frozen II</i>: the structure of the story…most of it comes in dense, exposition-heavy chunks that are staggered across the film.” – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii-1839780988">Germain Lussier, io9</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The narrative is a disastrous mess, to a thoroughly disappointing degree, where character and story aren’t appropriately motivated.” – <a href="https://freshfiction.tv/review-frozen-ii-gets-lost-in-the-woods/">Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction</a></blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <h3>What about its message?</h3>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen II</i> certainly delivers a solid morality tale without being overly moralizing.” – <a href="https://www.heyuguys.com/frozen-ii-review-frozen-2/">Linda Marric, HeyUGuys</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Female empowerment and finding strength through sisterhood assuredly remain sturdy tethers. There’s also a hearty ecological message instilled about working with nature, not against it.” – <a href="https://freshfiction.tv/review-frozen-ii-gets-lost-in-the-woods/">Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“All children should see <i>Frozen 2</i>, not just little girls. Because when Kristoff says, ‘I’m here. What do you need?’ that’s worthy of a discussion with everyone.” – <a href="https://lolalambchops.com/is-frozen-2-kid-friendly/">Tania Lamb, Lola Lambchops</a></blockquote>

      <h3>Is it funny?</h3>
      <blockquote>“Several times I started crying because I was laughing so hard, and once, I had a hard time catching my breath. This movie was funnier than I ever imagined it would be.” – <a href="https://mamasgeeky.com/2019/11/frozen-2-review.html">Tessa Smith, Mama’s Geeky</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The sequel is funnier, with Olaf stealing the show… even the most die-hard Olaf critics will find him hilarious in this.” – <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29786453/frozen-2-review-disney-release-date/">Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The biggest problem is that Olaf’s lines are all so funny the audience was laughing too hard for me to hear half of them.” – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii-1839780988">Germain Lussier, io9</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“What surprised me most about the film was just how hilarious they make Olaf. He was great in <i>Frozen</i>, but he absolutely steals the entire film this time around.” – <a href="http://shakefire.com/review/frozen-2">Matt Rodriguez, Shakefire</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Olaf totally steals the show this time as he grows up to ask the serious questions that every child is thinking.” – <a href="https://mamasgeeky.com/2019/11/frozen-2-review.html">Tessa Smith, Mama’s Geeky</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“This time around, [Olaf is] a scene-stealing, joke-dispensing machine from start to finish, and with a pretty good hit-to-miss ratio.” – <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-14/frozen-2-review-disney-elsa-anna-olaf">Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Every time he opens his mouth I felt like doing cartwheels.” – <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/frozen-2-review-disney-sequel-a4287556.html">Charlotte O’Sullivan, London Evening Standard</a></blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <h3>How are the new characters?</h3>
      <blockquote>“The newbies have their moments and all together make for a grander experience.” – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii-1839780988">Germain Lussier, io9</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“There’s also a handful of new friends to meet, all of which are welcome, many of which are underserved (Sterling K. Brown is the lone newbie who really gets to leave a mark).” – <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/frozen-2-review-sequel-disney-1202189123/">Kate Erbland, IndieWire</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“New sidekicks like playful wind spirit Gale and Bruni the Salamander are fun and cute but don’t add much to the proceedings.” – <a href="https://freshfiction.tv/review-frozen-ii-gets-lost-in-the-woods/">Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“There are very few new characters of any consequence.” – <a href="https://screencrush.com/frozen-2-review/">Matt Singer, ScreenCrush</a></blockquote>

      <h3>And the visuals?</h3>
      <blockquote>“The real power of this movie comes through its gorgeous, often jaw-dropping animation… whatever else can be said, <i>Frozen II</i> is truly beautiful.” – <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/frozen-2-review/">Josh Spiegel, Slashfilm</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Aesthetically speaking, this a dazzling beauty. The animators have created powerful imagery… highly detailed work [that] always shines through the fray.” – <a href="https://freshfiction.tv/review-frozen-ii-gets-lost-in-the-woods/">Courtney Howard, Fresh Fiction</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen 2</i>’s weirdest, and maybe worst, sin is how routinely unpleasant it is to look at. The animation is oddly bland and inert.” – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/frozen-2-disney-review">Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“What Disney hasn’t quite solved is its digitally rendered character designs, subtly altered from the earlier movie but still more akin to computer-generated Bratz dolls.” – <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/frozen-2-review-frozen-ii-1203404683/">Peter Debruge, Variety</a></blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <h3>More importantly, how’s the music?</h3>
      <blockquote>“The soundtrack is just as fun as the first <i>Frozen</i>.” – <a href="http://www.solzyatthemovies.com/2019/11/14/frozen-2-goes-into-the-unknown/">Danielle Solzman, Solzy at the Movies</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“When I tell you that this soundtrack is better than the first one, I know it will be hard for you to believe me. But it is true.” – <a href="https://mamasgeeky.com/2019/11/frozen-2-review.html">Tessa Smith, Mama’s Geeky</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“There really is a song for every mood, and I can see myself listening to the soundtrack on repeat.” – <a href="http://shakefire.com/review/frozen-2">Matt Rodriguez, Shakefire</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The song-writing team’s contribution to the franchise’s success can scarcely be over-estimated.” – <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/frozen-2-review-1254398">Todd McCarthy, Hollywood Reporter</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“There’s nothing wrong with these songs, per se, but the effort to replicate their previous success weighs down any possibility of letting them shine on their own.” – <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/frozen-ii-film-review-2019-kristen-bell-elsa-anna-disney/">Alonso Duralde, The Wrap</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“They all sound fine, and are sung with the usual bombast… and yet, not a half-hour after seeing the movie, I couldn’t call up a single melody.” – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/frozen-2-disney-review">Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The creative team have brought in the D-list for songwriting detail… with every song coming across like over-produced, over-polished album track filler with no hooks and no heart.” – <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/frozen-2/">David Jenkins, Little White Lies</a></blockquote>

      </figure>
      <h3>Does it deliver the next “Let It Go?”</h3>
      <blockquote>“The ‘Let It Go’ of <i>Frozen II</i> is called ‘Into the Unknown’… it’s guaranteed to entrance exhibitionist preschoolers looking for a new song to belt out at the top of their lungs.” – <a href="https://screencrush.com/frozen-2-review/">Matt Singer, ScreenCrush</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“There isn’t one A-plus standout like ‘Let It Go’ from the first film, but this time around, all the songs feel more uniform quality-wise. There isn’t a dud in the bunch.” – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/there-s-so-much-more-to-love-in-frozen-ii-1839780988">Germain Lussier, io9</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The songs don’t have that same punch this time around… there’s nothing in here that I think will take the world by storm like ‘Let It Go.’” – <a href="https://collider.com/frozen-2-review-kristen-bell/">Matt Goldberg, Collider</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Although not a single song in this sequel is likely to have the same iconic reach of songs such as ‘Let It Go’ or<i> ‘</i>Love Is An Open Door,’ there is still plenty here to shout about.” – <a href="https://www.heyuguys.com/frozen-ii-review-frozen-2/">Linda Marric, HeyUGuys</a></blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Is it still a good time for families?</h3>
      <blockquote>“For the most part, the kids seemed to think <i>Frozen 2</i> was pretty great — pretty exciting, pretty funny, pretty transporting.” – <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/frozen-2-disney-review">Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Tip: the youngest <i>Frozen</i> fans might need some warm hugs to get through a fraught final act.” – <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/frozen-2-review-sequel-disney-1202189123/">Kate Erbland, IndieWire</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen II</i> is arguably a darker, more mature film… it feels like it’s marketed to a slightly older fanbase than the first – perhaps the kids who grew up loving the initial entry.” – <a href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/review-frozen-ii/">Hannah Lodge, The Beat</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>“<i>Frozen II</i> is the must-see movie for families this year.” – <a href="https://lolalambchops.com/is-frozen-2-kid-friendly/">Tania Lamb, Lola Lambchops</a></blockquote>
