      <h1>NASA Research: Astronauts Are Getting Clots, Bizarre Blood Flow</h1>

      <p>According to a shocking report by NASA scientists, blood flow can stop and even reverse in the upper bodies of astronauts.</p>
      <p>The study could have some major implications about prolonged trips through deep space, as we’re still trying to nail down the exact effects of spending long periods in microgravity.</p>
      <p>The study looked at periodic ultrasound tests of 11 healthy astronauts who staffed the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>The results were alarming: blood flow had either stagnated or reversed in the left internal jugular vein, a major blood vessel on the side of the neck, in seven crew members. The tests also found a clot and a partial clot in two of the crew members after their return to Earth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755307">A paper</a> of the study was published in the journal <i>JAMA Network Open </i>on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“This was an unexpected finding,” Michael Stenger, senior author and manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/zero-gravity-serious-problem-nasa-study-finds-new-health-risk-n1081701">told <i>NBC News</i></a>. “We did not expect to see stasis and reverse flow. That is very abnormal. On Earth, you would immediately suspect a massive blockage or a tumor or something like that.”</p>
      <p>And that could have some very serious effects on astronauts’ health.</p>
      <p>“If you get a clot in the internal jugular vein, the clot could travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism — that’s very dangerous,” professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University Andrew Feinberg told <i>NBC</i>.</p>
