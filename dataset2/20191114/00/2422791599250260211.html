      <p>SYDNEY, Australia - The death toll for wildfires raging across Australia's most populous state has risen to four with a man's body found in a scorched forest in northeast New South Wales.</p>
      <p>Police say the body was found northwest of the town of Kempsey before midnight on Wednesday. He is suspected to be a 58-year-old who lived in a nearby shed.</p>
      <p>The man had not been seen since Friday when ferocious wildfires across New South Wales killed three people and destroyed at least 150 homes.</p>
      <p>About 60 fires continued to burn around New South Wales on Thursday morning, with 27 uncontained by more than 1,000 firefighters.</p>
      <p>Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers says the passing of Tuesday's "catastrophic" fire warning had not made battling blazes easier in the drought-stricken landscape.</p>
