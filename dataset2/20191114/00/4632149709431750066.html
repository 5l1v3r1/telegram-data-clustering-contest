      <p><i>By Santanu Chakraborty<br/><br/><br/>The spread of a tumour throughout the body, from the site where it first arose, is thought to result in the majoity of cancer deaths<br/></i><br/>While we usually think of cancer as one disease, cancers are in reality many different diseases with very similar effects on human tissue. Uncontrolled growth of cells leading to destruction of tissues and eventually death. The process by which cancers begin are complex, but they all disrupt multiple steps inside the cells of multi-cellular organisms that are designed to keep a tight leash on cell division. Note that cell division is not such a big issue for single celled organisms. As long as the bacteria, fungus or virus has enough resources to survive, it can reproduce and spread into the environment thereby maximizing its chances of continued survival. Somewhere in evolution, different cell types either came together and/or evolved to operate together as one unit. This required specialized functions for individual cell types combined with the initiation of set of events for reproduction. The arrival of a new member of the family is now, for large multicellular organisms like humans, a significant event. For life and reproduction to be possible for us we must hold the single cells in our bodies under some check, allowing them to grow in response to wounds or degradations of tissue but keep multiple checkpoints in the genetic code of the cells that will make them stop as soon as the job at hand is done. Occasionally cells manage to bypass these checks and balances inbuilt into our DNA. <br/><br/>Such behaviour can happen in any kind of dividing cell in the human body. The question though is that how is such a lack of control triggered. The answer lies in a combination of nature and nurture. Some people have genetic makeups that are more likely to develop cancer. Note, for example, that some families tend to have a long history of cancer in them. Yet people without any history of cancers in their family can also develop the disease. So clearly something else is going on. It turns out that we are exposed to numerous factors in the course of our daily lives that damage our DNA. Radiation and chemicals are the primary culprits. Modern societies have significantly higher exposure to such carcinogens via the air, water and food that we had a few hundred years ago. A third reason is purely statistical. Every time a cell divides it has a small but non-zero chance of making an error in the copying process. The longer you live the more the cells in your body would have divided and therefore increased the chance of something going haywire. <br/><br/>We live longer today with life expectancy in most countries having doubled over the past two centuries. We are also steeped in a society that uses massive quantities of chemicals and produces chemical pollutants on a regular basis. Combine the two and it is hardly surprising that cancers have increased in number over the last century. <br/><br/>It is this spread of a tumour – a process called metastasis - throughout the body, from the site where it first arose, that is thought to result in the majority of cancer deaths. If the primary tumour could be restrained in some manner and the spread of its cells to new locations restricted in some broad way, it could potentially increase lifespan greatly. How could we approach a problem like this? One approach is to use modern technologies to look at the genetic changes inside tumours that have already spread. Priestley et al. in a recent paper published in the journal Nature (Nature, Vol575, 7November2019) report a massive study which looked at the whole genome sequences of metastatic tumours (those that have spread) from over 2,500 individuals and 22 different types of solid tumours. <br/><br/><br/>Modern whole genome sequencing technologies have arrived at a point where the entire sequence of a human being’s DNA can be read out by a table top machine for less than one thousand US dollars. This was unthinkable even 20 or 30 years ago when the sequencing of the first human genome, all our DNA, required the launching of a large scale international research project. <br/><br/>Coupled with tabletop machines that can now churn out such data in days if not hours, we also have cheap desktop computers which can rival the costliest computers of a few decades back. What this means is that researchers are able to quickly sieve through large amounts of DNA sequence data comparing ‘normal’ DNA with diseased DNA (cancerous or otherwise) to find genes that may be altered. Priestley et al. find individual genes that are mutated in some metastatic cancers as well as numerous instances of the entire genome existing side by side with an extra copy of itself inside many metastatic cells. <br/><br/><br/>Our ability to detect minute amounts of DNA is high. Hence, these findings can be used as markers to diagnose the spread of tumours before they can be detected visually. Just as importantly, works such as these provide a valuable database which can be analysed for years to come so that hidden needle-in-the-haystack correlations can be determined triggering the development of new insights, therapies and research.</p>
