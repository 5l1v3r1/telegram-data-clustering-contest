      <p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed legislation to prohibit the sale of an over-the-counter cough suppressant to minors unless they have a prescription.</p>
      <p>The restriction on dextromethorphan will take effect next July. Dextromethorphan, or DXM, is found in many cough and cold medicines but has been abused by teenagers seeking a hallucinogenic high.</p>
      <p>Retailers selling the over-the-counter drug will be required to ask for ID unless a customer appears to be at least 25 years old.</p>
