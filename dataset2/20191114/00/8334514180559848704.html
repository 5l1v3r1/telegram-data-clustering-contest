      <p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Bolivia’s former President Evo Morales said on Wednesday that he condemned U.S. recognition of the South American country’s new “de facto government” that has installed itself since his departure.</p>
      <p>The Senate vice-president of Bolivia became interim president after Morales fled to Mexico for asylum on Tuesday. The veteran socialist has said his resignation was prompted by a coup, which he called in a tweet a “political and economic conspiracy” stemming from the United States.</p>
      <p>Michael Kozak, the U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said on Twitter the United States looked forward to working with Bolivia’s interim administration.</p>
