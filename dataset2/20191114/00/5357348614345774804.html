        <b>The central bank yesterday intervened in the foreign exchange market for the second-consecutive day, by offering an additional US$30 million for sale to authorised dealers and large cambios.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The offer, which was provided through the Bank of Jamaica Foreign Exchange Intervention and Trading Tool, follows Tuesday's intervention of US$40 million.</p>
      <p>That provision, which was sold at a weighted average rate of $142.38, was in response to recent fluctuations in the value of the Jamaica dollar against the US dollar, and public concern about the depreciation in the exchange rate.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Tuesday, the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) attributed fluctuations in the exchange rate to increased demand for foreign currency, “due to regular restocking by retailers for Christmas”.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the central bank said there has been “extraordinary demand” relating to portfolio transactions.</p>
      <p>“Notwithstanding the recent depreciation, inflows into the foreign exchange market remained healthy. For October 2019, average daily inflow from earners was approximately US$31 million, in line with October 2018,” the BOJ said.</p>
      <p>It noted, however, that demand has outstripped this supply due to the aforementioned factors, adding that “the bank does not expect that the recent pace of exchange rate movement will be sustained”.</p>
      <p>The central bank further emphasised in a statement yesterday that “these interventions are intended to address temporary demand and supply imbalances in the market”.</p>
