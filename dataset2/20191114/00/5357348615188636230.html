        <b>SOLAR Buzz Jamaica, an alternative energy company, is encouraging Jamaicans to invest in resilient power; noting that the long-term economic and environmental benefits are in the best interest of the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking at a home and auto exposition held Saturday at the Victoria Mutual Building Society's (VMBS) Liguanea Branch, Jason Robinson, CEO, Solar Buzz Jamaica, shared with the audience his vision of providing resilient power to all Jamaican homes, the island's critical infrastructure and certain commercial properties.</p>
      <p>In his presentation, Robinson focused on solar battery systems for homes, noting that resilient power for families is an underserved market that Solar Buzz is looking to grow, as he looks to form partnerships with financial institutions to offer financing options for more Jamaicans to have affordable access to solar products and services.</p>
      <p>“Resilient solar power offers families financial savings and back-up power through battery storage which is critical in a hurricane zone. These systems provide peace of mind when there are blackouts or load-shedding,” Robinson said.</p>
      <p>During the expo, patrons were able to do a consultation with Solar Buzz representatives and see where they would be saving money on their electricity bill with the use of solar to power their homes.</p>
      <p>“You can significantly lower your electricity bills through solar and other energy savings products/services such as glass tinting and energy efficient pool pumps,” Robinson said.</p>
      <p>Robinson was part of the team of stakeholders that attended the recently held Caribbean Renewable Energy Forum last month in Miami, Florida, where his team won the island resiliency competition for developing a plan for Anguilla.</p>
