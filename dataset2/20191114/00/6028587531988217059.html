      <p>When Antoine Griezmann finally signed for Barcelona this past summer, there was a mixed reaction from the supporters.Some were happy that a player of his evident quality had seen the light, albeit a year too late, whilst many hadn’t forgiven him for the shenanigans surrounding his ‘La Decision’ video from the previous summer.</p>
      <p>Clearly, it was going to take some consistent world class performances from the French World Cup winner to get everyone on side.</p>
      <p>Even taking into account a settling in period, given the size of his transfer fee, the honeymoon was always going to be brief.</p>
      <p>There have been flashes of his brilliance, in particular during the game against Real Betis where he scored two wonderful goals and was a thorn in the verdiblancos side all evening.</p>
      <p>However, those moments have been few and far between in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>So much so, that his numbers are worse than they were with Atletico Madrid who are, with respect, a more defensive outfit.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, he’s scored just one goal in his last eight games, and in most of them, he’s been on the periphery.</p>
      <p>It’s true that by being played out wide his skills aren’t being utilised to their fullest, a complaint that Philippe Coutinho made more than once before making the move to Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>But even when he’s had the chance to play a role that comes more naturally to him, he hasn’t taken the opportunity.</p>
      <p>For example, against Celta before Luis Suarez came on late in the game, Griezmann had completed just 21 passes.</p>
      <p>He looked lethargic and disinterested for large parts of the match, which has to be as a result of him not being involved as much as he would like.</p>
      <p>The late runs into the box that he was noted for at Atleti have often led to nothing at Barca.</p>
      <p>Either his team-mates are not on his wavelength and haven’t spotted his intelligent running and released the ball in time, or when they have, there’s so much ‘traffic’ in front of the striker that he’s unable to take advantage of any crosses or balls in behind.</p>
      <p>Though never a prolific scorer in any event, Griezmann’s four so far for the Blaugranes is a deeply unsatisfying return for a $132m outlay.</p>
      <p>After the two-week international break, things get no easier for the Catalans either. Barca will face Dortmund, Inter, Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Real Sociedad, as well as Leganes, Mallorca and Alaves before the winter break.</p>
      <p>Given how tight things are both in La Liga and the Champions League, they are all ‘must win’ games, and sooner or later Griezmann is going to have to step up.</p>
      <p>One major talking point has been the lack of associative play between the Frenchman and Lionel Messi, however, that’s more to do with trying to adapt to Barca’s style of play than the mischievous suggestion that the Argentinian doesn’t like him and so therefore is reticent to pass to him.</p>
      <p>With talk of Neymar still not going away, and the Brazilian most happy playing in the role that Griezmann currently occupies, there’s more than enough motivation for the latter to ensure he turns things around quickly.</p>
