      <p>I was in New York City last week, where I was investing in my learning—Something I always encourage my clients to do. Whenever my travels take me to NYC, I make it a point to see a Broadway show. This trip was no exception.With a little bit of luck, I was able to score orchestra seats to see The Tina Turner Musical, for a friend and me. What a show!</p>
      <p>We were mesmerized from the moment the curtain raised until the very end.  The young Anna Mae (Tina’s real name), who was played by Skye Turner, easily stole the hearts of everyone in the audience with her big, beautiful voice, and her charisma. Broadway veteran Adrienne Warren is, as the Rolling Stone puts it, <i>astonishing</i> as the Queen of Rock &amp; Roll in this biographical musical.</p>
      <p>As I danced in my seat (okay and quietly sung along), I thought about the struggles Turner experienced throughout her life. She overcame <i>a lot</i> to get where she is today.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the lessons I learned from Tina Turner that I hope will be helpful to you.</p>
      <p><b>There is no expiration date on talent.</b> At age 40, Tina Turner was considered a has-been. Record companies wouldn’t touch her with a ten-foot pole, as they were focused on young and upcoming talent.</p>
      <p>It’s been well over thirty years since Turner encountered age discrimination. Yet, this pattern of favoring youth over experience is alive and well in organizations. A day doesn’t go by when someone doesn’t write to me to share their experience with age bias.</p>
      <p>Age discrimination is real. Now, what are we going to do about it?</p>
      <p>Turner had more stamina at the age of 40 than people half her age. I know many fifty and sixty year old people that have more energy than their younger counterparts. Yet, time and time again, they are passed over for jobs and promotions. Here’s the reality. If you’re lucky enough to make it to age 40, 50, 60, or even 70, you will be facing the same uphill battle that workers in this age bracket are facing today. That is unless you approach hiring and leadership with a different lens.</p>
      <p><b>With resilience, you can overcome just about anything. </b>It’s no secret that Turner was abused by her husband, the late Ike Turner. Many people in abusive relationships never recover. Instead of crawling into a hole and dying, Turner worked diligently to take her rightful place on the stage again.</p>
      <p>A lot of us have experienced abuse in the workplace. Though we may not have physical scars, we certainly have internal injuries. People often feel helpless when their boss is misusing power. I get that. Early in my career, I worked for an abusive boss. A lesser person might have broken under her wrath. Not me. I chose to get even.</p>
      <p>I used this experience to strengthen my leadership skills. I looked at every situation that I encountered from the lens of that manager. I then did exactly the <i>opposite</i> of what she would have done. I wrote tons of articles about how <i>not</i> to lead, which I learned about directly from her. She was also one of the underlying reasons I wrote the book, <i>Suddenly in Charge</i>. I wanted to make sure that no one else had to experience what it was like to work for a boss who couldn’t manage or shouldn’t have been in management.</p>
      <p><b>Don’t let other people define you.  </b>Imagine being told you’re too black to be successful. This is exactly what record executives at Capitol told Turner. This didn’t deter her. She left London and decided to perform shows at New York City rock club, the Ritz. Eventually, she landed a new contract and became the superstar she is today.</p>
      <p>Everyone seems to have an opinion. I get unsolicited advice all the time. I don’t listen, and neither should you. The people who are giving unsolicited advice are doing so for themselves, which is why you need to ignore them. If someone tells you that you’ll never be good at something, walk away. If you’re told you’re too old or too brown or too whatever—discard these remarks.</p>
      <p>Define yourself. Think about what you’d like your future to look like and then work backwards to create your rightful place on this big stage we call life!</p>
