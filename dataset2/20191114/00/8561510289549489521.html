      <h1>Federal Judge: It’s Illegal to Post 3D-Printed Gun Designs Online</h1>
      <h2>He ruled that the Trump Administration can't simply reverse an earlier decision.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/kristin" target="_blank">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday, Judge Robert S. Lasnik <a href="https://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/192_ORDER_InvalidatingTemporaryModification.pdf">ruled</a> that the Trump Administration’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/us/3d-printed-gun-settlement-trnd/index.html">June 2018 decision</a> to allow the sharing of designs for 3D-printed guns online violated federal law.</p>
      <p>Some background: In 2013, an activist organization called Defense Distributed posted blueprints for a functional 3D-printed gun online. The Obama administration <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/464504/obama-administration-takes-aim-3dprinted-guns">ordered the group</a> to take the blueprints down.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Defense Distributed sued the government, claiming it had a First Amendment right to share the blueprints. The Justice Department argued that doing so violated export laws and threatened both national security and world peace — and both federal trial and appellate courts agreed, <a href="https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/federal-judge-strikes-down-trump-administration-action-allowing-release-3d">ruling against Defense Distributed</a>.</p>
      <p>But then in June 2018, the Trump Administration <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/us/3d-printed-gun-settlement-trnd/index.html">settled with Defense Distributed</a>, granting the company permission to post the blueprints online and paying it nearly $40,000 to cover the legal fees of founder Cody Wilson, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/cody-wilson-resigns-from-defense-distributed-which-is-now-under-new-leadership/">resigned from the company</a> three months later after he was <a href="https://apnews.com/793a05aca4544ebbb6a433a500f63e3d">arrested</a> in Taiwan, where he fled after having sex with an underage girl in Texas.</p>
      <p>Before Defense Distributed could post the plans online, however, Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit arguing that the Trump Administration’s decision violated both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act, which regulates how federal agencies develop and issue rules.</p>
      <p>Essentially, Ferguson asserted that the Trump Administration couldn’t just decide to contradict what the Justice Department previously argued — and Judge Lasnik agreed, calling the decision to allow Defense Distributed to share its blueprints “arbitrary and capricious.”</p>
      <p>“Given the agency’s prior position regarding the need to regulate 3D-printed firearms and the CAD files used to manufacture them,” he wrote, “it must do more than simply announce a contrary position.”</p>
      <p>Though it’s hard to say whether this will be the end of the legal back-and-forth between Defense Distributed and the federal government, Ferguson appears pleased with Lasnik’s ruling.</p>
      <p>“It is baffling that the Trump Administration continued to work so hard to allow domestic abusers, felons, and terrorists access to untraceable, undetectable 3D-printed guns,” <a href="https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/federal-judge-strikes-down-trump-administration-action-allowing-release-3d">he said</a>. “Even the president himself said in a tweet that this decision didn’t make any sense — one of the rare instances when I agreed with him. I’m thankful the court agrees, too.”</p>
