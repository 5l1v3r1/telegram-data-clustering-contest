      <p>The age of ‘tegridy is officially over, and <i>South Park</i> returns to, well, the town of South Park. But as the opening song suggests, this isn’t exactly a return to classic “four boys” format, but another spin-off within the show, some more time spent with side characters. PC Principal and Strong Woman are the stars of this week's episode, the two characters representing the “ultra-woke,” i.e., those intense Twitter accounts that hijack well-intentioned talking points and exaggerate them into contradictory nonsense.  </p>
      <p>Here, the show dives straight into a controversial and messy topic, with the issue of trans women competing in women’s sports, satirized by a caricature of the late “Macho Man” Randy Savage, known here as Heather Swanson. </p>
      <p>Strong Woman might be open-minded when it comes to inclusion in sports, but can’t help but feel slighted when Swanson, her ex-boyfriend, calls himself a women in order to enter the competition and ensure she doesn’t win first place. </p>
      <p>It’s kind of a clumsy take on a complex, divisive topic, a strawman that seems to exist only in the minds of TERFS, but the imagery of Swanson, all veins, muscles and bulging genitals, is admittedly, pretty funny. </p>
      <p>The plight of Strong Woman is mirrored by Cartman and the gang, who want to play board games badly, in peace, without girls entering their safe space and beating them with their studious, strategic approach. As Cartman becomes increasingly desperate, he turns to the law, making a case for gender exclusion using the plight of his classmate, Scott, who has diabetes, as a tool for pushing his agenda.</p>
      <p>It’s a satirical look at how layers of societal oppression and marginalization can come into conflict with one another, dividing progressives into opposing camps, with no clear moral solution. That is, unless one is acting in bad faith as clearly as Swanson. </p>
      <p>And Swanson is PC Principal’s greatest challenge yet, his stringent, black and white philosophy finally encountering a shade of grey that transcends his sense of moral superiority, Swanson even labelling him a “transphobe” in response to his objections. The labelling of opponents as bigots is usually Principal’s game, although Principal has a ‘tegridy that Swanson clearly lacks, despite his violent temper. </p>
      <p>Then there’s the PC Babies, sure to be unhappy with the fact that PC Principal physically pushed Swanson, a self-declared transwomen. The pressure of living up to the babies high expectations mirrors the plight of prominent progressives, who, with one wrong move, can easily ignite a wave of poisonous pushback from a self-righteous fanbase. </p>
      <p>It’s a complex, interesting topic that the episode doesn’t fully explore, focusing more on the absurd sight of Swanson flexing over his female opponents.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Swanson manages to make his way to the school, giving a boastful speech intended to “inspire” the young girls in the audience. Of course, Cartman strongly identifies with Swanson - Cartman would absolutely twist inclusion laws to rig the game in his favor, as he did in the Special Olympics episode.   </p>
      <p>Cartman’s legal victory, however, has backfired, the girls having created a superior gaming space that excludes boys, but at least Swanson is allowed to enter the room and play some board games against the girls, who subsequently destroy him. </p>
      <p>Thus, Swanson is humiliated, and PC Principal is vindicated, arriving home to find that the PC Babies don’t care about his transgression, understanding the nuance of the situation. It’s an acknowledgment that, Twitter tweens aside, progressive activism isn’t nearly as unhinged as the media makes it out to be - the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/09/14/bill-burrs-paper-tiger-exposes-the-myth-of-outrage-culture/">recent reactions</a> to Netflix’s stand-up specials being a good example. </p>
      <p>But this episode doesn’t seem to have much of a point, other than to state that there are some good reasons for gender exclusion, in a certain context, but uses an absurd example to enforce said point. The episode plays much like an extended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZgtMK0UxlY">Joe Rogan rant against trans women</a> fighting in MMA - it’s not wrong, but it's a narrow perspective of an immensely complex issue.  </p>
      <p>It’s bold of the show to approach such a topic in the first place, but the conclusion, which boils down to, “men shouldn't pretend to be transgender to game the system,” isn't controversial in the slightest, and has never actually happened.</p>
      <p>It feels almost as though <i>South Park</i> misses having a backlash, the show having previously engineered a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2457487/south-park-is-apparently-trying-to-get-south-park-cancelled">#CancelSouthPark marketing campaign</a> that didn’t reflect reality. At this point, those predispositioned to be offended by the show simply aren’t watching; not to mention, <i>South Park</i> has long moved on from its former nihilism and become unashamedly progressive.   </p>
      <p>“Board Girls” is a funny episode that wobbles on the social satire, seeking to make a strong point on a complicated issue, but unsure what to say, other than to state the obvious.</p>
