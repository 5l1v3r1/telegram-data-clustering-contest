      <h1>Quick And Dirty Digital Conversion For Analog SLR</h1>

      <p>The unarguable benefits of digital photography has rendered the analog SLR obsolete for most purposes. This means that a wide selection of cameras and lenses are available on the second hand market for pennies on the dollar, making them ripe targets for hacking. [drtonis] decided to experiment with a quick and easy digital conversion to an old Canon A-1, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-Analog-Camera-to-partially-Digital/">and it’s got us excited about the possibilities.</a></p>

      <p>It’s a simple hack, but a fun one. The SLR is opened up, and the spring plate for holding the film is removed. A Raspberry Pi camera then has its original lens removed, and is placed inside the film compartment. It’s held in with electrical tape, upon a 3mm shim to space it correctly to work with the original optics.</p>
      <p>[drtonis] notes that the build isn’t perfect, with some aberration likely caused by the reflective electrical tape in the film cavity. However, we think it’s a nice proof of concept that could go so much further. A Raspberry Pi Zero could be easily squeezed inside along with the camera, and everything glued in place to make things more robust. <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/01/25/the-current-state-of-the-black-market/">A specialist paint such as Stuart Semple’s Black 2.0 could also help cut down on light leaks inside.</a> Plus, there’s plenty of small screens that can be used with the Raspberry Pi that would provide a useful preview function.</p>
      <p>We’d love to see more conversions like this one. While it’s unlikely they’ll compete with commercial DSLRs on outright performance, everyone loves a little bit of charming distortion here and there, and all manner of fancy lenses can be had for cheap for analog platforms. <a href="http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip">We’ll be keeping a close eye on the tipline for further This fundevelopments</a> – you know what to do!</p>
