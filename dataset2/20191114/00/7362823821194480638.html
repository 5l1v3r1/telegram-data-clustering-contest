      <h1>Rep. Paul Gosar sends cryptic tweets that read 'Epstein didn't kill himself' during impeachment hearing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:12:07+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:12</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>A Republican congressman drew some attention to his Twitter account after observers noticed that a series of tweets spelled out, "Epstein didn't kill himself."</p>
      <p>Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., was quite active on social media reacting to the ongoing testimony of U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent as the first witnesses in a public impeachment hearing of President Trump, sharing videos and articles that memorialized the event.</p>
      <p>"Evidence of a link between foreign aid and political investigations simply does not exist. The longer this circus continues the clearer it becomes that @realDonaldTrump has done absolutely nothing wrong," Gosar wrote on his official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>Before that, "President @realDonaldTrump voluntarily chose to release the transcript of his phone call which clearly shows he did nothing wrong. This impeachment circus is a total sham, and Adam Schiff is the clown at the center of it all."</p>
      <p>And, before that, "Schiff’s star witness is crumbling under pressure. He wasn’t listening to the phone call and he has never even met President Trump."</p>

      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/congressman-drops-epic-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-meme-during-impeachment-hearing">Daily Wire</a> and others took notice that as readers scrolled down Gosar's profile, the first letters of each tweet spelled, "Epstein didn't kill himself."</p>

      <p>The "Epstein didn't kill himself" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeffrey-epstein-did-not-kill-himself">meme has spread like wildfire</a> after the death of convicted pedophile <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. The New York City medical examiner determined he had taken his own life, but vocal skeptics have suggested otherwise during random blurt-outs on television and other signs.</p>

      <p>In a statement to Fox News, Gosar stressed that his tweets were all "substantive" but appeared to have some more fun in the process.</p>
      <p>"All of the tweets pertained to testimony from today’s hearing.</p>
      <p>Rest assured, they are substantive.</p>
      <p>Every one of them.</p>
      <p>All of them.</p>
      <p>5 were brilliant.</p>
      <p>1 was ok.”</p>
      <p>In other words, "Area 51."</p>
