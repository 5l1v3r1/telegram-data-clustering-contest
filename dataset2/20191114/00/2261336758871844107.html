      <p>Ahead of a potential fight against top light heavyweight contender Dominick Reyes, the division’s champion Jon Jones has said he aims to drag the undefeated contender into deep waters if they do eventually fight.</p>
      <p>Reyes (12-0) made it six straight UFC wins when he spoiled Chris Weidman’s debut at 205 pounds last month at UFC Boston, knocking out the former middleweight champ in one round. “The Devastator” campaigned for a title shot against Jones following his recent win.</p>
      <p>The two have since exchanged words back and forth on Twitter, with <a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBones/status/1193576994337742853?s=20">Jones most recently calling out Reyes</a> for labeling himself as the “next generation” and showing fake respect to Jones. Replying to a user on Twitter who said to “submit” Reyes if they do fight, Jones said that would be the “easy way out” for the challenger.</p>
      <p>“That’s the easy way out, I don’t do easy,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBones/status/1193578759057657859?s=20">Jones wrote.</a> “There’s absolutely nowhere in his game I’m intimidated. He’s dangerous in the first round, after that I’ll figure him out and pick them apart”.</p>
      <p>Since beating Alexander Gustafsson in their rematch to reclaim the UFC light heavyweight title at UFC 232 in December 2018, Jones (25-1, 1NC) has defended his belt with consecutive decision wins against Anthony Smith and Thiago Santos.</p>
