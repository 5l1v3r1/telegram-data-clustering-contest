        <b>In the Middle East, after two days of military attacks between Israel and Palestinian militants that has left 32 people dead, a ceasefire has come into force, according to Egyptian, UN and militant representatives.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British public broadcaster BBC reports that Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says 32 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. On the side of Israel, 63 people have been treated for injuries and stress symptoms in Israel.</p>
      <p>The violence began after an Israeli air strike killed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander.</p>
      <p>Israel has not confirmed the ceasefire.</p>
      <p>UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov stated both the UN and neighbouring Egypt had «worked hard to prevent the most dangerous escalation in and around Gaza from leading to war.»</p>
