      <p><a href="http://edgevl.com.au/">EDGE Visionary Living</a> is WA’s premium apartment developer, focusing on providing cutting-edge design to apartments in highly desirable locations and ensuring an easy and enjoyable buying experience.</p>
      <p>Its vision is to deliver vibrant living spaces with standout architectural design results in distinct apartment communities.</p>
      <p>Edge understands the importance of choosing and creating a home that is unique to the client’s individual needs and works through this bespoke apartment journey with personalised service, creating a truly memorable experience.</p>
      <p>Vibrant apartment communities are facilitated by carefully created communal spaces and resort-style amenities.</p>
      <p>The award-winning Botanical Apartments feature the very best of resort-style amenities including a 25m infinity edge pool (above), fully equipped gymnasium, sauna and steam room, yoga retreat and multiple outdoor dining facilities.</p>
      <p>There is also a spectacular dining and entertainment area that can act as a function room with city views, plus a rooftop cinema for Perth’s summer evenings.</p>
      <p>Botanical innovatively changes the typically dark and unexciting corridors and hallways into open space gardens bringing the outside in with an atrium that is bathed in natural light.</p>

      <p>On every floor, each apartment is connected with a sky bridge and on some levels there are additional communal spaces with seating areas that allow for a vibrant community to develop.</p>
      <p>“It’s a privilege to create a beautiful parkside apartment address with premium resort-style amenities that are best of breed,” said Edge Visionary Living managing director Gavin Hawkins.</p>
      <p>Eden Floreat, currently under construction, is set to redefine apartment living in Perth with apartments up to 30 per cent larger than market standard, availability of car garaging, standard 3m high ceilings and up to 3.5m in penthouses to name just some of the unique features.</p>
      <p>In addition to Eden’s enviable location overlooking the lakes in Perry Lakes Reserve in Floreat, its range of high-end, luxurious amenities is endless.</p>
      <p>The list includes a 25m heated lap pool with resort-style pool beds and wading pools, multiple alfresco and dining spaces, wine cellar, spa, sauna, steam room and yoga studio.</p>
      <p>Additional features include a fully equipped air-conditioned gymnasium, games room, state-of-the-art cinema room with provision for up to 15 people, sunset terrace with treetop and lake views and book retreat and library, complete with quiet lounge space.</p>
      <p>Edge Visionary Living director and Hillam Architects principal David Hillam said the joy of architecture was crafting spaces loved by people and enjoyed every day.</p>
      <p>“Our desire was to design spaces that will exceed every expectation, whilst setting a new benchmark for resort-style, luxurious apartment living in Perth,” he said.</p>
      <p>Edge Visionary Living’s current portfolio also includes Vantage Apartments in an incredible riverfront location close to Optus Stadium and Crown Perth which has just been completed.</p>
      <p>Arthouse Apartments is under construction and the first of its kind in the northern suburbs while Orchard Terrace boutique apartments in Subiaco was recently launched with a name that references the terrace rooftop garden.</p>
