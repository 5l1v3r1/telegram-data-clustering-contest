        <li>1. [+9,451, -47] What is Seungri up to? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ</li>
        <li>2. [+5,492, -81] They're basically rapists but only getting less than 10 years in prison..ㅋㅋ</li>
        <li>3. [+5,008, -43] What about Seungri??? And YANG HYUN SUK??????</li>
        <li>4. [+3,311, -38] Seungri won ㅋㅋㅋ</li>
        <li>5. [+2,871, -30] "Cho Jong-hun's lawyer appealed to the court to review records and find him innocent because he was never involved in the gang rape and didn't distribute molka" Is he serious? He must think the public are dogs and pigs~</li>
        <li>6. [+890, -9] A friend of mine works at Jeju Golf Club and he said he saw Seungri, Park Han Byul and her husband playing golf 3 days ago ㅋㅋ</li>
        <li>7. [+691, -2] Cho Do Soon only got 12 years...what do you expect from this country~</li>
        <li>8. [+489, -10] What about pimp Seungri??</li>
        <li>9. [+410, -12] Look at him crying crocodile tears pretending to be sorry...does he think we'll forget it just because he cries fake tears?? Just know that it's harder to overcome the stigma of a criminal once you've been branded a sex offender by the entire nation. If you really want to reflect on yourself, don't hire expensive lawyers and cry fake tears for the public.Don't appeal and live like you're invincible for the rest of your life and die lonely and alone.</li>
        <li>10. [+207, -6] How did the ringleader get away with it? ㅋㅋ</li>
        <li>11. [+161, -8] What about Yang Hyun Suk and Seungri? Aigoo...what an unfair world..</li>
        <li>12. [+131, -7] Seungri Jung Jinwoon Zico Yong Junhyung Lee Jonghyun Roy Kim</li>
        <li>13. [+118, -5] What about Seungri? Yang Hyun Suk? How did they cut the tail and get away??</li>
        <li>14. [+48, -4] This sentence is too much...so what happened with Seungri? Does it make sense that Jung Joon Young and Choi Jong-hun will be behind bars but not Seungri?</li>
        <li>15. [+34, -2] The true legends that easily won the game..Yang Hyun Suk and Seungri ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ this is the reality of Korea ㅋㅋ</li>
      </ol>
