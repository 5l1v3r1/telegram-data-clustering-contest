      <p>The Christie’s postwar and contemporary art evening sale fetched $325.3 million at Rockefeller Center in New York on Wednesday night. While it raked in significantly less than the auction house’s spring sale, which totaled $539 million, only six of the fifty-four lots failed to sell, and four artists achieved record sums for their works.</p>
      <p>The auction began with the sale of Rashid Johnson’s <i>Untitled Anxious Audience</i>, 2018, which far surpassed its estimated purchase price of between $200,000 and $300,000 and netted $879,000, and Dana Schutz’s <i>Shooting on the Air</i>, 2016, which sold for $1.1 million, also above its estimate of between $600,000 and $800,000. The star of the night was <i>Hurting the Word Radio #2</i>, 1964, a rare early painting by Ed Ruscha, which sold for $52.5 million with fees.</p>
      <p>The work features the word <i>RADIO</i> spelled out in yellow lettering on a sky-blue canvas, and the letters <i>R</i> and <i>O</i> appear as if they are being warped by a C-clamp, a tool typically used by carpenters or metalworkers. Commenting on the piece, Todd Levin, a New York–based art adviser, told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/arts/design/auction-sothebys-christies.html"><i>New York Times</i></a>: “He did very few of these clamped pictures where the letters are torqued. It was an early painting with a great provenance in excellent condition. If you are a Ruscha collector it ticked all the boxes.”</p>
