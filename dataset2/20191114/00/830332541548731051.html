      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is telling state workers that Republican state senators are "amoral and stupid" for firing his agriculture secretary.</p>
      <p>Evers also told agriculture department employees at a meeting last week not to "let the bastards keep us from doing our work." That is according to a tweet from Cheryl Daniels, an attorney at the agency. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported the comments Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Evers said Thursday he doesn't think Republican state senators are "bastards," saying a comment he made using that word was invoking a well-known saying and not an insult. He said he was angry last week after the GOP-controlled Senate fired his agriculture secretary, Brad Pfaff. Evers said <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/evers-says-republicans-are-not-bastards-/1141888492">he met with state workers and told them not to let the "bastards" impede their work</a>. </p>
      <p>The GOP-controlled Senate on Thursday voted to fire <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/fired-wisconsin-agriculture-secretary-pfaff-gets-new-job-2/1141130467">Pfaff</a>. Evers took the unusual step of attending the Senate debate in person and afterward criticized the move in comments to reporters sprinkled with four-letter words.</p>
