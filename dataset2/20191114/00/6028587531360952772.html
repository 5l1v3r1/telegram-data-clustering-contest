      <h1>CQ3 2019 Hard Disk Drive Results</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Coughlin</a></address>
      <p>Here are some results reported in our latest <a href="https://tomcoughlin.com/product/digital-storage-technology-newsletter/">Digital Storage Technology Newsletter</a>. Total HDD shipments in CQ3 2019 were up 5.8% from CQ2 2019 (83.1 M units in CQ3 2019 versus 78.5 M units in CQ2 2019) compared with up 1.0% in CQ2 2019 from CQ1 2019, down 11.4% in CQ1 2019 versus CQ4 2018, down 9.7 % in CQ4 2018 compared with CQ3 2018. Note that Seagate and Western Digital have both changed their release of HDD shipments making it more difficult to figure out their actual unit shipments. WD started with their CQ3 2018 announcements while Seagate starting doing this in CQ1 2017. This has made it more difficult to report actual shipments of various categories of HDDs. Thus, the numbers reported here are our best guess estimates.</p>
      <p>Notebook HDD shipments were flat from the prior quarter while desktop HDD shipments increased by 8.1% Q2Q. CE HDD shipments were up 2.3% while branded shipments were up 1.2% Q2Q. High performance enterprise HDDs were up 8.1% while near line enterprise HDDs were the big winner, up 22.3% Q2Q.</p>
      <p>3.5-inch HDDs increased by 9.2% Q/Q. 2.5-inch HDDs increased by 2.6% Q2Q.</p>
      <p>In Table 1 we see a 4.5% ASP increase from CQ2 2019 to CQ3 2019 compared to an 4.2% increase from CQ1 2019 to CQ2 2019, a 1.6% increase from CQ4 2018 to CQ1 2019, 5.2% decline from CQ3 2018 to CQ4 2018, a 0.7% increase from CQ2 2018 to CQ3 2018 and a 0.4% decrease from CQ1 2018 to CQ2 2018.</p>

      <p>Figure 3 shows high, median and low estimate of total drive unit volume estimates out to 2025. Note that we have downgraded total projected shipments for 2019 based upon 2019 year to date results.</p>

      <p>Figure 4 gives our estimates for HDDs, magnetic media (disks) and heads production out to 2025 based upon the median estimate for HDDs in Figure 3. Slower growth in HDD areal density (at least through 2019) and the growth of capacity-oriented Near Line drives for enterprise and hyperscale applications will result in more components per drive out to 2025. We project that total shipments of heads and media will exceed the peak in 2014 by 2021-2022, largely due to the growth of high capacity (many heads and media) hard disk drives.</p>

      <p>Figure 5 shows the product announcement maximum areal density per quarter compared to lines representing areal density growth. Note that we are now in a period of extended product and laboratory areal density stagnation, similar to the period from 2011 through 2015.</p>
      <p>Figure 6 gives our projections for drives by market niche out to 2025. Figure 7 does the same for drive form factor.</p>
      <p>Figure 8 projects total shipments of HDD storage capacity on an annual basis to 2025. Figure 9 shows the average $/GB for HDDs. Figure 10 shows Seagate’s Q2 2019 Near-Line storage capacity trend. It looks like we may be starting an uptrend in near-line storage.</p>
