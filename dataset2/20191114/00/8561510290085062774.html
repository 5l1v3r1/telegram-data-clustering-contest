      <h1>Microsoft Is Hiding Source Code in an Apocalypse-Proof Cave</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Hard Copy</h3>
      <p>Next to the famous <a href="https://futurism.com/doomsday-seed-vault-upgrades">Global Seed Vault</a> in Svalbard, Norway, is an abandoned coal mine protecting a different kind of resource against the end of the world: all of GitHub’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">open source code</a>.</p>
      <p>Now, if the world ends, whatever survivors crawl out of the ashes will be able to access and use the software behind modern-day tech, perhaps on that weird <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/operating-system-computers-salvaged-world-ends">post-apocalyptic operating system</a> that some coders unveiled last month.</p>
      <h3>Rebuilding Records</h3>
      <p>Since 2017, the Arctic World Archive, as it’s called, has stored other digital records, including the Vatican archives, movies, and anything else deemed worth saving, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">according to a new <i>Bloomberg</i> feature</a>.</p>
      <p>And now, with Microsoft-owned GitHub’s contribution, it also holds a hard copy of nearly all the open source software in the world, which can be read with nothing more than a magnifying lens.</p>
      <h3>Precautionary Tale</h3>
      <p>The open source community is often dismissed as a fringe group of tech idealists, but much of the digital architecture with which we interact every day technically falls under the broad umbrella of publicly available open source code, <i>Bloomberg</i> reports. Think Facebook, Google, and Amazon — all of them rely on it.</p>
      <p>So, while GitHub’s data dump seems like — and probably partially is — a bit of a stunt, it could someday prove useful if a catastrophe wipes out the world’s hard drives.</p>
