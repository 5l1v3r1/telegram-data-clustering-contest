      <h1>Zanu-PF Youths threatens to storm Central Bank over leakage of cash onto black market</h1>

      <p>A ZANU PF apologist on social media, Kudzai Mutisi, has criticised Members of Parliament for keeping quiet and lacking the <i>cojones</i> to confront <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Reserve_Bank_of_Zimbabwe"><b>Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ</b></a>) officials for the leakage of new notes to the black market.</p>
      <p>Mutisi chided ZANU PF secretary for youth affairs and Chief Whip in the <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/National_Assembly"><b>National Assembly</b></a> <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Pupurai_Togarepi"><b>Pupurai Togarepi</b></a> for tweeting “cryptic riddles” while ignoring the new notes scandal. Mutisi wrote on Twitter:</p>
      <blockquote>We have a number of MPs here on Twitter… None of them has the balls to confront @ReserveBankZIM honchos about the leakage of cash to the black market… @TogarepiPupurai would rather tweet some cryptic riddles… If @KMutisi was your MP, l would be at RBZ this morning.</blockquote>
      <p>Mutisi’s comments come as a picture of an individual holding “bricks” of new banknotes while seated in a car went viral on social media.</p>
      <p>Government officials, including those at the RBZ and political elites and their children, have often been accused of driving the illegal cash business.</p>
