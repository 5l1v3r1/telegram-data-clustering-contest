      <p><b>Kate Middleton looks</b> radiant in <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406990/Photographer-Reveals-Kate-Middleton-s-Secrets-To-Looking-Photogenic-Every-Time/">almost every photo</a> taken of her, so much so that one enterprising plastic surgery clinic purportedly took the opportunity to convert her beauty into dollar signs. <br/><b>As reported by</b> <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/drgabriela_london?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Yahoo News UK</a></i>, London-based Dr. Gabriela Clinic—where Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7555643/Duchess-York-finally-confesses-cosmetic-tweaks-years-gloriously-candid-detail.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">proclaimed</a> to be a client of—supposedly used Kate Middleton’s image to advertise its facelifts on Instagram. <br/><b>The clinic was</b> purported to have compared a 2012 picture of the Duchess of Cambridge with one from 2014 in a post without her consent, writing, “Imagination of [a] natural look. We are doing procedures that [make] you look like fresh you.” <br/><b>This move obviously</b> did not go down well, as the clinic deleted the photos after being called out for it. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>In a statement</b> obtained by <i><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/palace-fury-kate-middletons-photo-20844799?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">the Mirror</a></i>, the Queens’ former communications secretary Ingrid Seward called the ad “ill-thought-out” and “blatantly awful,” as “prospective clients may be inclined to think that Kate has had a laser facelift… when she most certainly has not.” <br/><b>Dr. Gabriela Clinic</b> responded that it did not intend to “cause any offence” with the campaign, and ultimately decided to take down the misappropriated images of Kate Middleton. <br/><b>The side-by-side shots</b> have been reposted by the Instagram account below.</p>
