      <p>The Minister of Communications, Mrs Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, is pushing for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to be taxed for the profit they make on mobile money transactions.<br/><br/>At a press conference in Accra on Thursday morning [November 14, 2019, the Minister said the operators generate some GH¢71 million monthly on the transactions, yet that money remains untaxed.<br/><br/>“This is of particular interest to me but this is where the Finance Minister and I diverge because I think that 71 million [cedis] which is generated by the operators in transaction fees, they ought to pay taxes on that revenue to the State.<br/><br/>“We are still having conversations about that,” she added.<br/><br/>Data from the Bank of Ghana last year showed that mobile money transactions increased from GH¢155 billion to GH¢233 billion representing 43 per cent growth in just a year.<br/><br/>It also showed that the volume of transactions on the mobile money platform increased from 2017 to 2018 reached GH¢1.4 billion. The value of transactions had also seen a significant increase from 2012 to 2018. For instance, in 2012 total transactions, reached GH¢594 million and increased significantly every year to hit GH¢233 billion in 2018.<br/><br/>In June, the World Bank declared Ghana the fastest-growing mobile money market in Africa with registered accounts increasing six-fold.<br/><br/>This undoubtedly translates into huge profits for telecom companies and the Communications Minister wants to ensure that the State does not miss out on revenue from that sector.<br/><br/>“Nobody is talking about actual mobile money transactions that are conducted by individuals. However, I am interested in the revenues that the mobile network operators earn from the transaction fees that own-users of the services pay to them.<br/><br/>“And I think the GRA [Ghana Revenue Authority] ought to have a conversation with them about that,” she added.<br/><br/>Featured Video</p>
