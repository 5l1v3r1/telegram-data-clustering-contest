      <h1>New Motorola Razr Is $500 Cheaper Than Samsung’s Galaxy Fold</h1>

      <p>Motorola has launched its next generation rehash of the early 2000s popular flip phone, the Razr. It has a flexible display that, when closed, folds into almost half of the phone’s extended size and it’s $500 cheaper than Samsung’s Galaxy Fold. Priced at $1,499.99 and available to buy January 9th 2020, Motorola has issued a challenge to Huawei and Samsung, both of which have launched foldable phones this year that cost around $2000. But the headline price may not be the full story.</p>
      <p>Looking at the specifications, the Razr features last year's Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor, which you’ll find on mid-range devices like the Vivo Next and Nokia X7. Also the single 16MP f/1.7 rear camera is yet to be tested fully and there isn’t an additional wide or telephoto lens. As we know, camera ability is an area Samsung excels in. </p>

      <p>One glaring red flag on the specification list is the size of the battery - just 2510mAh. That’s small for a smartphone with an OLED display and a 2142 x 876 resolution display that, when fully extended, is 6.2-inches long. I presume fitting large, inflexible, components into a device that is half the size of a regular handset when collapsed may be have been the design conundrum that lead to this decision. </p>
      <p>Also, Motorola is probably banking on users mostly interacting with the less power-hungry external “Quick View” display and only extending the phone when really necessary.</p>
      <p>The language in the press release suggests that might be the case, which mentions “disconnecting” and “taking a break from distractions”. Whilst talking about all of the functions that can be undertaken from the Quick View display (toggling settings, taking selfies, controlling music and using Assistant to name a few). We’ll have to see how big an issue - if an issue at all - that small battery is when I get to fully review the phone. </p>

      <p>Elsewhere, in pure design terms, the Razr looks impressive. Motorola says that it experimented with 20 different designs before it settled on this form factor and I think it made the right choice (even if it does look a bit chunky).</p>
      <p>The familiar clamshell shape is a nostalgic win and the fact that it’s a device that collapses to half it size <i>will</i> be popular. As will the satisfying clap sound from snapping it shut. It’s also folds completely flat, unlike the Galaxy Fold which has a gap between the two displays when closed. </p>
      <p>The impressive-looking foldable display and price are the standout features for the new Razr, but there big question marks around battery life, camera abilities and performance. I’ll know more in the coming weeks when I get a chance to properly review the device, so stay tuned for more information. But, for now, it appears Motorola has disrupted the nascent foldable phone market with a genuinely unique device. </p>
