        <b>Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB) has once again punished officials of the State Revenue Service (SRS) who were caught illegally acquiring information from systems.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Officials, driven by personal motives, were caught acquiring information from information systems that is not necessary for performance of their duties.</p>
      <p>Two inspectors were applied fines of EUR 70 and EUR 80.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, KNAB had found similar crimes in the actions of other institutions in the past. Most officials caught in the act were from VID.</p>
