        <figcaption>WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 13: top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr. (R) and Deputy ... [+] Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs George P. Kent (L) testify before the House Intelligence Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill November 13, 2019 in Washington, DC. In the first public impeachment hearings in more than two decades, House Democrats are making a case that President Donald Trump committed extortion, bribery or coercion by trying to enlist Ukraine to investigate political rivals in exchange for military aid and a White House meeting that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky sought with Trump.

      <p>Testimony in the first day of impeachment hearings suggested that President Trump directed a concerted effort to get Ukraine to investigate Democrats at the cost of America’s national security. <b>A Star Is Born</b></p>
      <p>The principal witness, septuagenarian William Taylor, exceeded Democrats’ high expectations as much as the septuagenarian Robert Mueller, earlier in the year, had disappointed them. Taylor<b> </b>looked the part, sounded the part, and acted the part. The hair, the Walther Cronkite voice, the complete sentences, the confidence, the intellectual vigor, the courage, the belief in America as a force for good, the commitment to service, the courteous humoring of the debunked conspiracy theories, and the willingness to concede with a laugh that Trump’s irregular channel of diplomacy “was not as outlandish as it could be” presented a compelling picture.</p>
      <p>Although Taylor had not interacted with Trump one-on-one, he offered something else: in his person: he epitomized the very values that have made America great, and in upholding those values showed why Trump’s actions were achieving the opposite. Here was a decorated veteran and diplomat—non-partisan, rational, idealistic yet pragmatic—America at its best depicting America at its worst. </p>

        <b>Bombshell News</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike the first day of the Watergate impeachment in 1973 which according to the <i>Washington Post</i> of that day “would have appealed only to those who enjoyed watching grass grow,” the first day of hearings also produced a bombshell revelation: a previously undisclosed phone call by E.U. Ambassador Sondland to President Trump from a cell-phone in a restaurant in Kyiv on July 26, the day after the notorious official telephone call between presidents Trump and Zelensky which had set off the impeachment inquiry. According to an embassy staffer who was with Sondland at the time of his call with Trump, Sondland said that “President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden” than Ukraine.</p>

      <p>The freshly revealed conversation, if confirmed, should disprove any lingering suspicion that Trump was uninterested or uninvolved in the effort to get Ukraine to announce investigations into the Bidens. (Trump himself said yesterday he has no recollection of the call. Further testimony is expected from Sondland and the staffer who overheard the call )</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Theory Of The Case For Impeachment Explained</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps most important, Taylor explained in public in words of one syllable the theory of the case for impeachment, without ever mentioning that term. He presented an understandable narrative of what has happened and why it is wrong.</p>
      <p>Ukraine was not, he said, some obscure country with little relevance to America. Ukraine is on the front lines of America’s 74-year struggle to keep the world safe from Russian aggression. That effort had been successful in keeping the world free of major military conflicts until 2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Taylor explained how America’s efforts to support Ukraine’s defense of his country was a life and death struggle in which Ukrainian citizens were being killed every week. America’s support of those efforts was central. Refusal to give that support was both a setback to Ukraine and an encouragement of Russia to continue its expansion in violation of international norms. Trump’s conduct therefore, not only damaged the integrity of America’s electoral process: it also damaged America’s national security.</p>
      <p>“Ukraine is important for our national security, and we should support it. Not to provide that would be folly,” said Taylor. “Even as we sit here today, the Russians are attacking Ukrainian soldiers in their own country. I saw this on the front line last week.”</p>
      <p>America, he said, is a country governed by the rule of law that attempts to help other countries also be governed by the rule of law. It was, therefore, odd for Trump to be asking Ukraine to do the very kind of thing—political interference in an election—that America is urging other countries <i>not</i> to do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Republican Responses</b>
      </p>
      <p>Republicans still seem undecided as to how to respond to the testimony. It has been difficult to argue with the growing body of evidence that the failed attempt to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens didn’t happen.</p>

      <p>The Republican defense oscillates between the following:</p>
      <p>·        It didn’t happen.</p>
      <p>·        It is only hearsay that it happened, so we can’t be sure that it happened.</p>
      <p>·        Even if it happened, Trump wasn’t involved and wasn’t directing it.</p>
      <p>·        If it did happen, it wasn’t wrong.</p>
      <p>·        Trump was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/jim-jordan-tries-to-recast-trump-as-the-hero-of-the-ukraine-scandal">heroically fighting corruption</a>–an honorable goal.</p>
      <p>·        There was no quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>·        The Trump White House doesn’t have the capacity to execute a quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>·        Even if it was wrong, the act wasn’t criminal</p>
      <p>·        Even the act was criminal; Trump had no criminal intent.</p>
      <p>·        Even if it was a crime, it is not impeachable.</p>
      <p>·        The attempt failed; the military assistance was released, and no investigations were carried out; no harm done.</p>
      <p>·        The military assistance is, in any event, irrelevant because Javelin missiles can’t be used in the conflict with Russia.</p>
      <p>·        President Trump has provided more assistance to Ukraine than President Obama; he shouldn’t be blamed, let alone impeached, for a brief pause in that assistance.</p>
      <p>·        This kind of thing happens all the time.</p>
      <p>·        What happened was unusual, but not outlandish.</p>
      <p>·        Because it could have been even more outlandish, it wasn’t so bad.</p>
      <p>·        There were other things happening in Ukraine that are much worse.</p>
      <p>·        We can’t do anything until we hear from the original whistle-blower</p>
      <p>·        The hearings are a partisan sham.</p>
      <p>·        The process for the hearings is unfair to the president and fatally flawed.</p>
      <p>·        There is nothing to see here: it’s much fuss about nothing.</p>
      <p>·        We should wait for the election and let the American people decide.</p>
      <p>During the hearings, Republicans made much of the fact that Taylor had never met the president and had no direct knowledge of what the president said, thus disregarding the fact that the content of Trump’s conversation with President Zelensky of July 25 has already been made public by Trump himself. Taylor, however, did something else: he was able to give direct evidence about those who executed Trump’s scheme. In any event, Republicans will get what they are calling for: at least four other witnesses are expected to provide direct evidence next week of what the president actually said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Likely Impact</b>
      </p>
      <p>The hearings changed the mind of no one in the hearing room and probably few minds beyond. But we are still at day one. The real question is whether the accumulation of evidence and the lack of a coherent response will change minds over time.</p>
      <p>Support for impeachment and removal was already at 47% before the hearings, compared to only 19% at a similar moment before congressional hearings in the Watergate scandal. In Watergate, hearings over a year grew popular support for impeachment, with that support eventually reaching 60%. At that point, Republican support for Nixon in the Senate evaporated, and Nixon resigned.</p>
      <p>Impeachment of Trump by the House now seems inevitable. Even if the Senate doesn’t convict and remove Trump from office, evidence from the televised hearings will unite Democrats in a common cause and provide input for the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Suburban women in the suburbs of cities like Pennsylvania, Milwaukee, and Detroit, who could have a decisive impact on the 2020 election, may be more open than Republican senators to listen and to protect the concept of America as a country of principles and laws.</p>
