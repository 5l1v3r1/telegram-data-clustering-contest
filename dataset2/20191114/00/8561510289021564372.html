      <h1>Japanese Space Probe Returning to Earth, With Chunks of Asteroid</h1>

      <h3>Heading Home</h3>
      <p>Earlier this year, Japan’s Hayabusa2 space probe pulled off the unprecedented feat of landing on a distant asteroid and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/watch-japanese-spacecraft-grab-rock-asteroid">collecting rock samples</a> to take back as a souvenir.</p>
      <p>Now, the probe is beginning its long trek back to Earth — a bittersweet moment for the team behind the craft.</p>
      <p>“I’m feeling half-sad, half-determined to do our best to get the probe home,” project manager Yuichi Tsuda told reporters, as <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/japan-s-space-probe-is-returning-to-earth-with-an-actual-piece-of-asteroid">quoted by <i>Agence France-Presse</i></a>. “Ryugu has been at the heart of our everyday life for the past year and a half.”</p>
      <h3>An Amazing Journey</h3>
      <p>It’s been an amazing journey for Hayabusa2.</p>
      <p>In September 2018, the space probe <a href="https://futurism.com/hayabusa2-asteroid-ryugu-collect-samples">successfully landed</a> a number of robot rovers onto the tiny asteroid Ryugu some 300 million kilometers (186 million miles) away, sending back countless fascinating pictures in the process.</p>
      <p>Hayabusa2 had to take some drastic measures to free up Ryugu’s rock samples, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/japan-releases-video-asteroid-bombing">tossing an explosive</a> at the asteroid in April to dislodge rocks small enough for it to scoop up during a brief touchdown.</p>
      <h3>Saying Goodbye</h3>
      <p>Hayabusa2 sent its <a href="https://twitter.com/DrBrianMay/status/1194758550775619584">last stereo image</a> of Ryugu on Wednesday and should reach Earth in 2020.</p>
      <p>As part of a <a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20191113e_SAYONARA_Ryugu/">“Goodbye Ryugu” campaign</a>, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency is asking the public to tweet messages or even send postcards via snail mail to say goodbye to the lonely asteroid.</p>
