      <h1>Atlanta Falcons owner to donate $6.8M for international aid</h1>

      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - The billionaire owner of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-falcons/">Atlanta Falcons</a> is making his first major drive into international philanthropy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arthur-m-blank-family-foundation/">Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation</a> is expected to announce Thursday that it’s donating $6.8 million to the aid group CARE. The money will fund efforts to avert humanitarian crises abroad and support a village savings program in Africa.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arthur-m-blank-family-foundation/">foundation</a> has helped numerous charities in Atlanta and elsewhere in the U.S. since its founding in 1995. The CARE grant is its first large-scale international project.</p>
      <p>Blank - a co-founder of Home Depot Inc. - bought the Falcons football team in 2002 and also owns the Atlanta United soccer team. His family and foundation have donated more than $400 million to charities, according to the foundation’s website.</p>
      <p>Blank said in an email that the CARE grant is a “natural extension” of the foundation’s work.</p>

      <p>“The challenges being addressed by our Family Foundation - poverty, human rights, climate change - are global,” he said.</p>
      <p>Blank’s gift will allow CARE, which is also based in Atlanta, to expand its village savings and loan program in Tanzania and Malawi and launch a savings and loan program in Nigeria, CARE CEO Michelle Nunn said in a telephone interview.</p>
      <p>Villagers pool their savings to provide interest-bearing loans to members to start small businesses and pay for health care and education. CARE provides training in governance, group dynamics and money management.</p>
      <p>The programs serve nearly 7.6 million people in 51 countries, most of them women, according to CARE.</p>

        <p>Nunn said Blank’s donation will allow CARE to serve more than 1 million additional women.</p>
        <p>The savings and loan programs are “very resonant with Arthur’s sense of entrepreneurship” and his support for women’s empowerment, Nunn said. She said she’s known Blank for decades.</p>
        <p>“He’s always had a global mindset,” Nunn said.</p>
        <p>Blank will also serve as co-chairman of a new CARE committee in Atlanta that will help the organization plan for the future.</p>
