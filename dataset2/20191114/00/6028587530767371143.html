      <p>Sports have an empowering, almost patriotic effect on people and government leaders, corporate sponsors and civil society organizations from around the world have taken note. To this end, Hon. James P Moore Jr, an American professor, former senior government official and the founder of the <a href="https://www.washinst.org/">Washington Institute for Business, Government and Society</a>, is convening the Washington Institute Global Sports Conference in 2020. The first summit of its kind, the Washington Institute Global Sports Conference will be held at the Gaylord Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland from June 17-18, 2020. Coinciding with the 2020 Summer Olympics, to be held in Tokyo, and with an eye toward the 2022 World Cup, the Global Sports Conference will focus on the security, infrastructure, and ethics underpinning international sporting events, as well as the impact of sport on business, government, and society.</p>
      <p>I recently had a chat with Hon. James P Moore Jr regarding the African and emerging market opportunity for foreign direct investment (FDI) through sports and what his Global Sports Conference plans to accomplish.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How can African countries embrace and profit from the commercialization of sports on the continent?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In my view, there is an opportunity for African countries to take advantage of the greater geo-commercial benefits of professionalized sports in their own countries while fostering a conducive climate for a generation of young athletes to flourish, those that can become household names without having to leave the continent. Let me add, there is a much-needed seat at the table for these athletes, their club managements and pan-African sponsors at the Global Sports Conference, one that in my view has yet to be filled effectively in the genre.</p>
      <p>Governments must to a greater degree realize that they need to play their part in what must be public-private ventures to help provide proper infrastructure that clubs, communities and whole cities may presently be lacking. This must be done in order to create a professional environment where athletes can thrive and spectators can have a safe and memorable fan experience. As Kelvin C. Omuojine of SportHouse LP puts it in his 2018 'Law in Sport' retrospective, "...while there is no doubt that sports could play a critical role in attaining developmental goals, a policy vacuum, poor governance and inadequate investment all show that African governments are yet to fully appreciate this potential and have yet to integrate sport into their national development plans.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in an era where a vast quantity of profits will come from broadcasting rights and the sponsorships that follow, Omuojine explains that, “...a robust legal framework for the protection of media and intellectual property rights ensures that economic benefits are not misplaced but are channeled towards the sustained growth of the sports industry [in country].”</p>
      <p>If the public and private sectors can work together and establish a strong legal framework, there is potential for an economic boom in Africa provided by a seemingly whole new industry. The rewards will not only be monetary nor symbolically inspirational, but could help to bolster employment, improve local infrastructure and create numerous social benefits that will last long after the last fan has left the stadium. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What were the motivations for the Washington Institute for Business, Government and Society launching the Global Sports Conference (WIGSC / GSC)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>From perspectives here in the United States to those applicable  in Africa and truly around the world, it is clear that we stand at the precipice of a societal, cultural and political inflection point.</p>
      <p>The search for accountability and real-time problem solving from nation to nation leaders, both in the public sector and private, has never been more critical. Frankly, bringing deep experience to addressing modern challenges and brokering opportunities within evolutionary business, government and society was the rationale for founding our Washington Institute.</p>
      <p>More specifically, sports have served as a mirror of our world’s history at each juncture. The issues that it encapsulates, be it corporate social responsibility (CSR), to the integrity of the games themselves, to protections and fair play in an era of digitization, past, present and future concerns matter to individuals from all walks of life, including world leaders.</p>
      <p>The Washington Institute Global Sports Conference is not just about lectures and ‘death by power point’; it must have interactivity, impact, and forge a tangible result. Addressing the signature, historic and 21<sup>st</sup> century issues and opportunities of sport and how global sports, including the Olympics and World Cup, influence business, government and societal dynamics are the motivating factors to our getting involved and launching a holistic discussion, one that we plan to have inspire future generations of athletes, corporate executives and political leaders alike.</p>
      <p>The Global Sports Conference brings together the best and brightest in the industry, perhaps for the first time, from host nation representatives, to political actors to stewards of enterprise. Learning from past lessons, they can broker solutions to the challenges impeding the integrity of the business of sport, while ensuring its DNA encourages mutually-beneficial investment in people and communities.</p>
      <p>We look forward to welcoming everyone to the Washington Institute for Business, Government and Society’s inaugural Global Sports Conference.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You speak to addressing certain oft-ignored issues, which must include emerging market human rights and local employment in the hosting of events such as the World Cup; how does the Washington Institute look to play a role in this discussion?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s face it. There have been human rights concerns in sport dating back to the dawn of the Olympiad. They have evolved and often tragically expanded during the course of human history and despite best intentions from all stakeholders, growing concerns in sporting events have outweighed the solutions to them systemically.</p>
      <p>However, there has been tremendous opportunity brokered through sport and the hosting of sporting exhibitions. Emerging markets from around the world have more and more opportunities to be endowed with a tremendous showcase, a platform to promote perhaps newfound best practices and ultimately the values and cultural distinctions that make each respective host nation incentivizing to both travel and tourism and multilateral investment.</p>
      <p>And so we need to openly examine the economic trends that foster human rights failures to be part and parcel of so many exhibitions, to assuage concerns through tangible commitments and re-instill global trust in the process.</p>
      <p>Employee safety issues during the Olympics or World Cup stadium construction operations have raised important questions - Dangerous conditions, long working hours, an inadequate complaint system, even deaths on the job, have created a myriad of serious labor infractions.</p>
      <p>There is also the question of addressing lingering human rights matters in the host countries themselves. I see sport as an opportunity here; a prospect for a host nation to address rights groups, realign policy and let the world know that they are open for newfound dialogue and enterprise discourse.</p>
      <p>Further, looking at the tragic xenophobic events in the South Africa of 2019, for instance, which, as host nation to the World Cup of 2010 would then be deemed as an aberration, it is pertinent to ensure the unifying power of sport maintains in each nation’s citizenry and the communities that shape it. This is an impetus on every business, government, and civil society organization involved and who comes to benefit from such an exhibition.</p>
      <p>At home, health concerns and the rights of athletes are issues brought to the surface daily in the consciousness of national sport. We will look at retirement for National Football League (NFL) players, their healthcare and the steps that have been taken in the spirit of best practices to avoid risks, such as concussions. This was once a taboo subject to address in the past; it will now be biennial.</p>
      <p>There is no room for ‘sportswashing’. We look to play a central role in hosting the discussions that emphasize fair play both on the pitch and with regard to human rights, reflecting upon what has not worked historically and fostering together on-site, newfound solutions that can bring about tangible change.</p>
      <p>To the crux of your question, the hosting of a major sports venue should be a proponent of national job creation and foreign direct investment (FDI). We take our role in enhancing this process and in the opportunities abundant for emerging market prosperity through sport very seriously.</p>
      <p>
        <b>eSports and online gaming (and gambling) have been jockeying for legitimacy in the traditional sport arena. With their energetic emergence comes next generation challenge, such as hacking. Have you considered the inclusion of eSports in deliberations to be held at the Global Sports Conference?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Absolutely! The frenetic energy and enthusiasm behind eSports has swept like a wave around the world. The financial projections for the industry are striking.</p>
      <p>This billion-dollar industry has also caught the attention of current traditional sports owners, corporate execs, and advertisers, who are pouring millions of dollars into the production value of tournaments. ‘2K’ competitions are as popular as the real thing. Samsung and Korean Telecom own teams outright, with individual athletes following suit.</p>
      <p>The prowess borne of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) ultimately means the digitization of sport itself. But how do you regulate? How do you, for example, crack down on underage online gambling and unregulated eSports betting? In an era of ‘Big Data’, one cannot simply push ‘instant replay’ - How do you ensure cybersecurity, data protections, and check the manipulation of competitive sport for monetary benefit?</p>
      <p>I’ve been reading a book by Steve Case, the Founder of AOL, called ‘The Third Wave’ which underscores the challenge, one I recently had the opportunity to talk to Steve about and reflect upon –Technology has advanced so quickly, government, business and society have to do a better job to understand its trajectory, along with that trajectory’s challenges and opportunities.</p>
      <p>These are issues that simply cannot be earmarked for a governing body or anarray of governing bodies to address. The commitment of all stakeholders involved must be assured and as we look to advocate on behalf of those stakeholders, it is the ethical responsibility of our Global Sports Conference to remain on the cutting edge and host talented leaders, both from the ‘start up’ eSports community, and those established entrepreneurs and enterprises who have joined the movement, openly and ideally forging a regulatory framework not unlike the Valve Anti-Cheat System (VAC), one that all can adhere to in the spirit of free and fair ‘2.0’ competition.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the contemporary threats to stadium goers and those that congregate in 'fan zones' and how would you surmise they being combated?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The bombing of the Manchester Arena during an Ariana Grande concert in May of 2017 and the Las Vegas shooting at a country music festival later that same year may not have occurred during sporting exhibitions, however they showcased the great dangers that large crowds unfortunately face in modern society on a global scale. Furthermore, these acts cemented the fact that we are living in an era of 'lone-wolf' attacks. This means that stadium security must keep a close eye on every single person, not only inside, but along the perimeter of the venue as well.</p>
      <p>The good news is that technological advances are aiding this seemingly herculean process. </p>
      <p>Comprehensive surveillance systems not only offer high-resolution imagery, but biometric and digital intelligence-driven data can be shared in real-time across multiple security and emergency response sectors. </p>
      <p>Single cameras are today often connected to state of the art command centers, those which can also control entry access and alarm systems. With the multimedia and security platforms merged, personnel are freed up to attend to the problem area with efficacy. Furthermore, in the cyber arena, certain systems can survey social media posts within and around a 'geo-fenced' venue area. This allows security to spot potential issues such as individuals espousing malicious intent or would-be fans 'crowdsourcing'; in this case, preparing for a pre-meditated conflict.</p>
      <p>Facial recognition is also a tool that is rapidly becoming a 'must-have' for all venues. Outside of the stadium, facial recognition cameras are tied to databases which can be utilized to stop those previously banned from entering the stadium. Inside the stadium, facial recognition is utilized to identify perpetrators and enable security to better recognize those 'bad actors' which they must confront. </p>
      <p>Technology also allows the crowd to police itself. Anyone with a smart phone now has the ability to tweet or send text-messages to a Team or arena hot-line; 'seeing something, saying something' when trouble is spotted pragmatically.</p>
      <p>Finally, age-old tactics, such as K9 units and vapor-wake dogs are used to detect explosives and other harmful substances on a mobile target. This allows the crowd flow to continue while a dedicated venue security apparatus monitors a steady stream of spectators and alert of potentially dangerous targets. </p>
      <p>
        <b>What environmental and energy initiatives would you foresee being rolled out during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics? What can we as spectators do at a personal level to reduce our waste and energy consumption while attending such a massive event?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While companies are holding their cards 'close to the vest' in terms of products and initiatives that may be rolled out at next year’s Olympics, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Committee launched an auspicious Sustainability Plan that highlights 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The goals are set within major sustainability themes which you probably recognize, such as Climate Change; Resource Management; Natural Environment and Biodiversity; Human Rights, Labor and Fair Business Practices; and Engagement and a Sustainable Sourcing Code, to name a few. </p>
      <p>According to Tokyo2020.org, the organizing committee is “...also committed to making sure the meaning behind the Tokyo 2020 Games, its concepts and lasting legacies will be passed on to future Olympic / Paralympic Games and resonate in various activities and initiatives throughout Japan and the world.” A bold statement, underlined by the fact that they mean it. Perhaps most impressive is that electricity used in the Olympic Village and competition venues will be powered by 100% renewable electricity.</p>
      <p>Fans wishing to play their part can and should take advantage of the excellent public transportation system in Tokyo, avoid one-time use plastic products throughout their visit, and acquire their tickets electronically to avoid paper waste. </p>
      <p>Ecological initiatives, much like climate change, are today fundamental concerns to business, government and society 'as usual' and accountability in this arena will no doubt play a role at our exciting inaugural.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where do you envision the Global Sports Conference brand in five years’ time?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I envision us planning for our third Conference - The Washington Institute for Business, Government and Society has since its inception been dedicated to empowering governance and enterprise; critically, each sectors that serve to benefit from leveraging the opportunities of globalization all the while doing good. While we envision our Washington Institute programs diversifying over time, the Global Sports Conference is launched as a flagship unifier, a biennial event indicative to our core values and beliefs.</p>
      <p>We look to capitalize on sport’s cross pollination into the critical issues pertaining to technology, human rights, geo-polity, commerce, and free and fair competition, creating a milestone on the annual calendar that becomes a ‘must attend’ event for those at the leadership forefront in business, government and society. It is up to us to foster such lasting opportunity, lighting the torch that can be passed on into the next generation. I implore and look forward to your readers joining our journey as we look to shine a light on best practices in one of the more indelibly impactful industries to permeate across all sects of human civilization.</p>
