        <b>State Revenue Service (VID) Tax and Customs Police found a large number of contraband cigarettes in vehicles bearing forged diplomatic registration plates, VID reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>SRS Customs Office in cooperation with State Border Guard performed an inspection of two vehicles driven by two Mongolian citizens. As it turned out, the diplomatic registration plates of said vehicles were forged. During the inspection the drivers handed fake car registration passports issued in Kazakhstan. While performing the inspection, customs officers suspected possible smuggling attempt. This is why vehicles were moved for an in-depth customs inspection. Cars were scanned and checked using a K-9 unit.</p>
      <p>The in-depth inspection revealed a stash of 5 132 800 contraband cigarettes bearing excise stamps of the Republic of Belarus.</p>
      <p>Two criminal processes in accordance with Part 1 of Section 275 and Part 1 of Section 190 of the Criminal Law were launched. Two Mongolian citizens born in 1979 and 1984 are held suspect.</p>
