      <p>The Lexus RC F has been around a while now, and though it’s not the mental speed freak that the LFA was, it still has a place in the brand’s lineup. It isn’t a huge leap to start thinking of the RC F as a full-on sports car, capable of blistering speed and nimble moves on the track, but there’s more to the car than that.It’s more accurate to think of the RC F as a luxury grand touring car, rather than an all-out performance machine. It’s big, heavy, and not particularly agile, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not fun or worth a look. I spent a week with the RC F, using it as a daily driver, and doing things with it that most buyers probably won’t. After that time, it became clear that, while the car falls short in some areas, the overall experience is a solid one.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Performance</b>
      </p>

      <p>With a 5.0-liter, 472-horsepower V-8, the RC F has the right foundation to make some serious speed. Along with the eight-speed automatic transmission and some electronic trickery from the selectable drive modes, the powertrain is strong enough to push the RC F to 60 mph from a standstill in just over four seconds. Those aren’t supercar numbers, but they don’t have to be. The RC F makes all the right noises and produces power when it needs to.</p>
      <p>Around town, there’s little indication that a big, rowdy V-8 lives under the sheet metal in front of you. The car is more than happy to handle the morning commute, soaking up nasty spots on the roads, and producing a comfortable and compliant ride. The Lexus’ magic shows up when it’s pushed – even a little bit – and the engine wakes up. Moving up through the driving modes to Sport S+ sharpens steering response and opens up the exhaust with a great growl. The sensation here isn’t all that much different than a classic muscle car, with strong acceleration accompanied by a mean sound.</p>

      <p>Lexus and parent company Toyota have finally begun sliding Apple CarPlay into their vehicles, which simplifies operation of the infotainment system greatly over the somewhat complicated Enform system. My RC F test car came with a Mark Levinson sound system that provides exceptionally loud and clear sound with strong bass. The system also comes with navigation, but it becomes a bit redundant if you use Apple CarPlay’s maps. Steering wheel-mounted controls work well, and the trackpad is less infuriating here than in past Lexus models.</p>
      <p>The RC F comes standard with adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, and automatic high beams. My test car came with the optional blind spot warnings and rear cross-traffic alerts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Comfort</b>
      </p>

      <p>From the front seats, there’s absolutely nothing to complain about. The RC F’s cabin welcomes its guests with roomy but form-fitting chairs up front, almost hugging passengers with well-bolstered sport seats and high-rise door sills. Though there’s plenty of space, the cabin is tailored for a sporty feel and all controls are well within reach of the driver.</p>
      <p>Things are a different story for back seat passengers. Anyone with legs will have a hard time even getting into the RC’s rear seat and will have even more difficulty riding back there with any degree of comfort. In a stroke of either sheer determination or sheer disregard for my kids’ comfort, we used the car as our primary commuter for the week it was here. While my six-year-old daughter could ride somewhat comfortably behind the driver’s seat, I had to move a bit closer to the wheel than I’d like for my six-foot frame. On the passenger side, my three-year-old daughter in her full-size car seat could ride without much complaint, but only with the front seat moved far forward. Luckily, my wife is just over five feet tall, so the need for space up front on that side was minimal. It’s safe to say that RC F buyers aren’t looking for a family car, but it’s nice to know you can make it work in a pinch.</p>
      <p>Ride quality is spectacular for such a sporty car, thanks in large part to the optional adaptive suspension that firms or softens up depending on the setting. Being a Lexus, the RC F doesn’t sidestep its mandate to provide a coddling and leisurely driving experience altogether to achieve its athletic abilities.</p>
      <p>Taken for what it is, the Lexus stands up well in a hotly contested segment full of strong competitors. If you were presented with an RC F and had no other points of comparison, you’d feel like the luckiest person in the world, but if you’re expecting a rowdy track machine that can match up with the BMW M4 or Mercedes-AMG C63, you’ll be a bit disappointed. That said, the Lexus has an ace up its sleeve in the form of all-around ability, and it does <i>most things</i> very well. Besides, most people don’t take their cars to the track anyway, and you’ll forget all about that when you hear the big V-8 howling away under the hood.</p>
