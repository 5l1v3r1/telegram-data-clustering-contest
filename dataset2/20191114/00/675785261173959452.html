      <h1>The Apprentice fans rage as seventh BAME candidate fired and Lottie Lion remains</h1>
      <h2>The racism row surrounding The Apprentice has deepened after Jemelin Artigas was axed from the show and all the while the allegedly racist Lottie Lion stays on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:04:44+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 00:04</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-apprentice">The Apprentice</a> racism row deepened during the latest show after the seventh BAME candidate in a row was fired by Lord Sugar.</p>
      <p>Budding entrepreneur Jemelin Artigas, who hails from Argentina, was sent packing while a candidate accused of racism toward another contestant remains.</p>
      <p>Lottie Lion has been surrounded by controversy since day one, and allegedly told the now-fired Lubna Farhan "shut up Gandhi" in a WhatApp message.</p>
      <p>Fans took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to question why the seven fired candidates have all been from minority ethnic backgrounds.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "At first I thought this was a coincidence but this apprentice racism is just too consistent now. And Iasha PM'd the task that made Â£1mil bu didn't do enough? naaaah."</p>

      <p>Another penned: "Can the racism in the Apprentice be any more obvious? #theapprenticeuk."</p>
      <p>"It's time to stop watching the apprentice now," a third insisted, "Just look at the pattern in the first seven weeks. Unconscious bias training would be a start! @BBC. Compounded by Lottie's racist rants and you've got to start asking questions. Someone? Anyone? #TheApprentice2019."</p>
      <p>The first six weeks of the show saw the firing of Shahin Hassan, Kenna Ngoma, Souleyman Bah, Lubna Farhan, Riyonn Farsad and Iasha Masood.</p>
      <p>Jemelin spoke to the Mirror Online about being fired, saying: "I felt like I could have stayed but I also felt I couldn't see myself as Lord Sugar's business partner.</p>
      <p>"I don't come from a corporate world, I'm a designer. I've got high morals."</p>
      <p>She also hit out at Lottie for her alleged racism, adding: "I just find it really sad. Because you've got 16 contestants, they have given their lives away, giving their jobs, family up....yet we are focusing on completely the wrong thing and I just feel saddened on it.</p>
      <p>"We shouldn't just make it about one person. It's not fair on the other contestants.</p>
      <p>"She did what she wanted to do and it made me really angry because we have other amazing contestants with amazing backgrounds."</p>
