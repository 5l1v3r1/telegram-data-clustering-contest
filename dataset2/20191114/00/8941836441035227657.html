      <h1>Roger Stone has ‘turned to God,’ spiritual adviser Randy L</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jeff-mordock/" target="_blank">Jeff Mordock</a></address>
      <p>As a former colleague from President Trump’s 2016 campaign delivered damning testimony in the perjury trial of right-wing gadfly <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Roger Stone</a>, the accused sat quietly at the defense table and did something no one expected: He read the Bible.</p>
      <p>The sight of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> quietly thumbing through the Good Book contrasted sharply with the outlandish persona of the longtime GOP operative whose profane and vulgar texts dominated the prosecution’s case.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Randy Lancaster-Short</a> wasn’t surprised, though. He’s been <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s spiritual adviser for the past two years and handed his friend the Bible, recognizing it was what he needed at that moment when a one-time campaign ally, Rick Gates, threw him under the bus.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> attended every day of the nearly two-week trial in Washington, sitting in the row reserved for family and eating lunch with the Stone family in the courthouse cafeteria.</p>
      <p>The African-American Harvard Divinity School graduate said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s faith is strong, despite spending decades cultivating a bad-boy image.</p>
      <p>“There is a heart there,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said in an exclusive interview with The Washington Times. “He’s got a bark, but sometimes the nicest dog has the loudest bark.”</p>

        <p>He’s known the longtime GOP operative since 2016, when they met through a mutual friend.</p>
        <p>The unlikely duo of a lifelong religious leader and self-described dirty trickster began discussing politics. But as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s legal woes mounted, his faith grew, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said.</p>
        <p>About a dozen FBI agents in riot gear stormed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s house in a January predawn raid to arrest him. The tactics used by authorities were criticized by some conservatives as excessive force.</p>
        <p>“He’s really seeking intervention,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said. “People’s faith ebbs and flows, but imagine if you had 50 armed people with submachine guns at your house. You’d be calling God real fast.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>, who was raised Catholic, and his family have openly displayed their faith as the trial wears on. They were spotted at Sunday Mass last weekend and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s wife, Nydia, even posted on Instagram a photo of them in church with a prayer emoji.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s wife and daughter sat in court this week with a Bible open in their laps reading the Book of Psalms.</p>
        <p>Washington’s political crowd has a difficult time believing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> has turned to a higher power.</p>
        <p>During the trial, talk-show host Randy Credico testified about years of bullying by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> falsely told Congress Mr. Credico was his connection to WikiLeaks as the organization was pumping out damaging emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> then pressured Mr. Credico to stonewall lawmakers to undermine the Russia investigation, fearing his lies would be exposed, the government has said.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors read threatening text messages <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> sent to his longtime friend. In the messages, some with vulgar language, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> called him “a rat” and “a stoolie” and told him to “prepare to die.”</p>
        <p>In another text, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> threatened to harm Mr. Credico’s dog, although Mr. Credico admitted on the stand that the threat was “hyperbole” he didn’t take seriously.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> is quick to acknowledge <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>’s flaws, noting Jesus’ love for sinners.</p>
        <p>“Everyone comes up short in the glory of God,” he said. “There is a really nice psalm about that, ‘Jesus, what a friend of sinners.’”</p>
        <p>“When the government comes on you, you lose your house, your money, people shut you off, who else would you turn to? I would rather he turn to God than alcohol or drugs or harming himself,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said.</p>
        <p>There is a private side to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> that contradicts the outlandish character portrayed in the media, according to his spiritual adviser.</p>
        <p>He said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> and him were working to draw attention to the issue of human trafficking and other crimes against African-Americans in Haiti.</p>
        <p>“Before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Roger Stone</a> got into trouble, he was the only person helping. [The criminal case] really hurt us because there were not many people who would listen,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said.</p>
        <p>The two also were planning a book about lead poisoning in the water and its impact on the African-American community, according to the preacher.</p>
        <p>“Somewhere in there is love for the rest of humanity,” he said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> attends court every day wearing a white religious smock. It draws attention even among the unusual and controversial supporters who have stood with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a> during the trial.</p>
        <p>It’s important that he stands out in the crowd, he told the Times.</p>
        <p>“A lot of people think <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Roger Stone</a> doesn’t have any friends who are black or believe in God,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said. “People forget he worked with black pastors like Al Sharpton and others.”</p>
        <p>Other, more polarizing Stone supporters, including alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Gavin McInnes, founder of far-right activist group Proud Boys.</p>
        <p>“I didn’t know Milo or if I would like him, but whatever you think of Milo, what you see is what you get,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> said. “In the clergy, we deal with murders, rapists and white-collar crooks. Why can’t <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Roger Stone</a> be friends with whomever?”</p>
        <p>As a verdict looms for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>, his spiritual adviser said he is hoping for an acquittal, calling the charges a waste of taxpayer money on a case the prosecutors didn’t prove.</p>
        <p>More than anything, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/randy-lancaster-short/">Mr. Lancaster-Short</a> wants people to pray for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Mr. Stone</a>.</p>
        <p>“That’s a lot of damage to put on one life in a year’s lifetime,” he said. “He’s been uprooted, lost his house, money. They’ve put this stuff on him and people are always going to believe he’s guilty. I hope first and foremost, people pray for him to heal.”</p>
