      <p>PORT JERVIS, New York (WABC) -- Authorities are investigating after a newborn baby was discovered along a walking path in a wooded area in Port Jervis.</p>
      <p>Police received a call late Tuesday night about the discovery alongside Hornbeck Avenue and Brooklyn Street around 10:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Port Jervis police believe the baby had just been born because the umbilical cord was still attached.</p>
      <p>Neighbors said they heard police outside during the investigation later that night.</p>
      <p>"We were right next door - we could have taken the baby. Just wrap it up and leave it on our doorstep, we would have taken care of it. It's sad," neighbor Luis Tarrats said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>State police are assisting in the investigation by sending a forensics team.</p>
      <p>An autopsy is being performed by the Office of the Orange County Medical Examiner.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to contact the Port Jervis Police Department at 845-856-5101.</p>
