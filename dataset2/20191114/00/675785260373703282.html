      <h1>Making this one change could save enough energy to power Aberdeen, Cardiff and Manchester for a year</h1>
      <h2>The way our energy is supplied is undergoing the biggest upgrade in a generation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Masters, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/dave-masters/</a></address>
      <p>The climate change emergency is on ­everyone’s minds – but 60% of us say we would be more inclined to try to help the environment if we had a better ­understanding of what we can do.</p>
      <p>Despite the noise around recycling and reducing single-use plastic, there’s one missing piece in the climate change conversation: becoming more energy efficient.</p>
      <p>Yet we could get 11% closer to the UK’s 2050 carbon emissions target right now if we all took energy efficiency measures at home.</p>
      <p>On top of what we can do in our own ­households, the country’s energy system is in urgent need of an upgrade.</p>

      <p>Our current, outdated system wastes millions of pounds worth of energy because the system cannot accurately map out when and where demand is high. However, smart meters in our homes are able to provide the data needed for the whole country to become more efficient.</p>
      <p>Upgrading to a smart energy system could save our country millions of pounds each year – and cut carbon emissions to help us meet the Government’s 2050 targets.*</p>
      <p>Put it like this: if every household got a smart meter, we could save the same amount of energy as it takes to power every household in ­Aberdeen, Cardiff and Manchester for a year.**</p>
      <p>It is feared that a whopping £650million is currently being wasted by our energy system, which could be saved by a smarter, more efficient infrastructure. Every household can play a part in cutting this waste by getting a smart meter fitted.</p>

      <p>You might already be aware that they can help you monitor your energy use so you can cut your consumption, but they will also help us monitor and manage our energy supply at a national level.</p>
      <p>The data smart meters can generate will allow our system to ­understand how much energy is used, when and where across Britain. That means we’ll be able to better plan for high demand and waste less.</p>
      <p>As well as helping to reduce the amount of waste, the new system will allow the UK to lessen its reliance on harmful fossil fuels, because a flexible system that can predict demand better will be able to store and use electricity from unreliable green sources more efficiently.</p>
      <p>If every home switches to a smart meter, the whole nation becomes smarter. Each town and city can play its part to build up a picture of how much energy is needed.</p>
      <p>Demand for energy – particularly electricity – is predicted to increase by 50% by 2050, so the time to act is now. This is partly because of the move to greener technology such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, and the need to make sure we have stable green sources of energy to meet this demand.</p>

      <p>Getting a smart meter might seem like a small step, but it’s an important one. If every home in the UK takes action, we’re a step closer to building a modern, flexible energy system.</p>
      <p>“It’s easy to feel overwhelmed in the face of the climate crisis,” says Robert Cheesewright, from Smart Energy GB. “It might feel like turning your thermostat<br/>down by a degree or washing your clothes at a cooler temperature can’t possibly make a difference.</p>
      <p>But if every ­household in the country took the energy efficiency measures available right now, together we could make an important step towards meeting UK’s 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target.</p>
      <p>“What’s more, even if you just had your smart meter installed, and did nothing else, you would be helping to build a modern, flexible energy system that is less wasteful and makes better use of renewable energy sources.”</p>
