      <p>Here we go again with another security warning for users of Android smartphones. This time, though, the issue isn’t <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/11/06/new-google-android-threat-these-7-malicious-apps-may-be-downloading-malware-onto-your-phone/#512fab6d75af">malicious apps</a> installed from the Play Store, the issue is the phones themselves. Cyber powerhouse Check Point <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/the-road-to-qualcomm-trustzone-apps-fuzzing">claims</a> to have hacked into the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/security-ip/trustzone">TrustZone</a> on certain Android devices—the “hardware-enforced isolation built into the CPU,” in which the most sensitive data is held. Check Point hacked phones from Samsung, LG and Motorola—but the issue is wider, the vulnerability was found within Qualcomm’s hardware that powers <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4258173-qualcomm-vs-mediatek-long-short-strategy-smartphone-processors">almost half</a> of all mobile phones.So what exactly is the TrustZone? Yaniv Balmas, Check Point’s head of cyber research, explains that “TrustZone holds all your secrets—fingerprints, facial recognition, credit cards, passports, whatever secrets you can think of, these things are stored in TrustZone. Think of it as a safe manufactured by the chip manufacturer—in this case Qualcomm. The thing about this safe is the no-one knows other than Qualcomm how it is actually built. It’s proprietary and no-one can see inside of it.”</p>
      <p>Qualcomm confirms the vulnerabilities flagged by Check Point, but says they have been fixed. A spokesperson told me that “providing technologies that support robust security and privacy is a priority for Qualcomm. The vulnerabilities publicized by Check Point have been patched, one in early October 2019 and the other in November 2014. We have seen no reports of active exploitation, though we encourage end users to update their devices with patches available from OEMs.”</p>
      <p>So an updated device is not at risk. But if there was a perception that the TrustZone secure data store was impenetrable by threat actors, that myth has been broken. There will likely now be other vulnerabilities found and (ideally) patched. Check Point says that with the potential to hack into the TrustZone now out in the open, researchers and threat actors will turn their attention to this secure store, which in the past they may have left it alone. And for smartphone users, that introduces a new set of risks.</p>
      <p>If you tell a security team or a hacker that something is secure or hack-proof or impenetrable, it’s a red rag to a bull—you essentially fire a starting pistol for one of those teams or hackers to break your walls down. And so it is here. Most Android vulnerabilities are limited to the operating system’s Rich Execution Environment (REE)—where the majority of the phone’s functionality and vulnerabilities reside. The REE can be thought of as your phone’s “non-secure world.”</p>
      <p>Sitting alongside the REE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which is based on that TrustZone architecture and which uses hardware instead of just software to add security layers, creating a sandbox that protects data and runs trusted code. Check Point spent four months proving this “secure world” is also vulnerable. The actual TEE deployment is down to the manufacturer—in this case Qualcomm.</p>
      <p>According to Balmas, the TrustZone is “security by obscurity.” Technically, he tells me, the hardware-based safe is an internal operating system. “Other vendors develop applications for this operating system but are not familiar with it—they just get a set of tools and APIs. It’s secure because no-one knows how it works. So we wanted to see if we could find vulnerabilities inside this safe—we invested lots of work and we found several vulnerabilities inside the trustlet apps that run on the operating system.”</p>
      <p>So how did Check Point break down those impenetrable Qualcomm walls? The team used a technique called “fuzzing,” essentially throwing masses of unexpected data at a computer system to flush out full-scale crashes, memory leaks and data breaches. The trick with this is that the format of the fuzzed data is close enough to what is expected that the system gets confused. As the system then errors, vulnerabilities are exposed that can be exploited to mount an attack.</p>
      <p>Balmas explains that with knowledge of the vulnerability in mind, “any attack vector would be possible. This could be remote by an email with a link, or a zero click in extreme cases with no user interaction. Researchers usually look for vulnerabilities inside normal applications like Facebook or WhatsApp in the non secure world. No-one is looking in the secure world. They think everything is safe. But it’s not.”</p>
      <p>Check Point first briefed this research back in June at <a href="https://cfp.recon.cx/reconmtl2019/talk/DYGNJQ/">Recon Montreal</a>. At the event, the research team explained that it had “reverse engineered the Qualcomm TrustZone ecosystem and found that trusted apps constitute the perfect target for the fuzzing-based vulnerability... Secure World’s trusted apps are responsible for the business logic of mobile data security. Those apps must be the most protected part of the mobile device, which makes them crucial and challenging target for security research.”</p>
      <p>Now, as covered in detail in its <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/the-road-to-qualcomm-trustzone-apps-fuzzing">report</a> published on November 14, Check Point reports that it has used this fuzzing technique to test trusted Qualcomm code on Samsung, LG and Motorola smartphones. All the devices exposed vulnerabilities. “Hence,” the team says, “we proved that programmers from the best vendors as well as Qualcomm made mistakes in their code.” Check Point says it disclosed the vulnerabilities to the vendors so that patches could be deployed. All of those vendors were also approached for comment before this story was published.</p>
      <p>It is critical that owners of Android phones from these brands, and others—Qualcomm’s reach is far and wide, ensure their phones apply the latest software updates and continue to do so. “Android users trust TrustZone to protect their secrets,” Balmas says, “whether they know it or not. The fact we found vulnerabilities means those secrets might no longer be so secret and someone can steal them.”</p>
      <p>According to Check Point, patching such vulnerabilities is a real challenge, Balmas describes it as a “nightmare” as it needs to come from the processor manufacturer to the device manufacturers in tandem with Android, then out to a user group that can be notoriously slow in applying patches. But Slava Makaveev, a security researcher at Check Point confirmed to me that the patches had closed the vulnerabilities found.</p>
      <p>Keeping the firmware updated is the best defence against such vulnerabilities—and Qualcomm stressed that the issues exposed have been fixed and users can secure their devices with the latest updates. That said, those Android updates are difficult to manage given the fragmented nature of the manufacturing base. And so as an additional security measure, Check Point is also suggesting users “check their credit and debit card providers for any unusual activity,” given the nature of the data at risk.</p>
      <p>This should serve as a reminder as to how much faith we place in the smart devices we now carry everywhere and entrust with everything. Check Point says that this research has “dispelled the belief that this ‘Secure World’ is breach-proof by cyber hackers.” The team says it revealed “a gaping hole,” and now sees this as the start of something wider. Qualcomm will also know full well that this exposure is unlikely to be the last, that further issues will be exposed. “Give us three more months,” Balmas tells me, “and we’ll find ten more vulnerabilities. And we are not the only people looking.”</p>
