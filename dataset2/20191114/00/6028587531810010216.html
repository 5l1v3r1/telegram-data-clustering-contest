      <p>New Jersey has asked Uber to fork over hundreds of millions in unemployment taxes for its drivers, who the state says it considers employees.As <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/uber-hit-with-650-million-employment-tax-bill-in-new-jersey">Bloomberg Law</a> reported Thursday, New Jersey’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development sent letters to Uber and subsidiary Rasier LLC assessing a total of $523 million in back taxes on ride-hail drivers, following at least four years of inquiries by the state.</p>
      <p>According to state documents reviewed by Bloomberg, the company may also be on the hook for as much as $119 million in penalties and interest, bringing the total monies potentially owed to nearly $650 million.</p>
      <p>“The state’s determination is limited to unemployment and disability insurance, but it could also mean that Uber is required to pay drivers minimum wages and overtime under state law,” Bloomberg wrote. “Uber’s costs per driver, and those of Lyft, could jump by more than 20% if they are forced to reclassify workers as employees, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.”</p>
      <p>An Uber spokeswoman commented by email, “We are challenging this preliminary but incorrect determination, because drivers are independent contractors in New Jersey and elsewhere.”</p>
      <p>The company also noted that the process will probably take years, and suggested that, in any case, the estimated $650 million in back taxes and interest may be significantly too high, based on its actual operations in the state.</p>

      <p>The news comes as Uber and Lyft’s stock prices continue to slide, and while the companies keep fighting for an exemption from California’s recently passed labor classification law known as AB5.</p>
      <p>Similar laws, which classify workers as either independent contractors or employees based on the nature of their work through an ‘ABC test,’ have already been in place in New Jersey and Massachusetts for several years.</p>
      <p>The New York Do It Right Employment Classification Test (NY DIRECT) Coalition, which has been advocating for similar legislation to be passed in New York, commented by email that New Jersey’s Department of Labor “did the right thing for Uber drivers.”</p>
      <p>“We call on New York legislators to follow the examples set by New Jersey and California and ensure that the same employment laws apply to Uber as to any other company,” the group wrote. “California and New Jersey are holding Uber to account to the benefit of working families and the communities that rely on them. Now it’s New York’s turn.”</p>
      <p>Rebecca Smith, director of the Work Structures program at the National Employment Law Project, one of the groups behind the NY DIRECT Coalition, also commented by email, "Uber's misclassification of drivers harms workers stripped of their rights and benefits — but it also hurts state coffers. For too long, Uber has skipped out on paying its fair share.”</p>
