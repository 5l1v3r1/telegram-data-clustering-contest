        <b>Latvian Trade Union of Health and Social Care Workers (LVSADA) council plans to decide on future protests on Tuesday, 19 November, as confirmed by the trade union.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Latvian Nurses Association’s (LMA) president Dita Raiska, Latvian Young Doctors Association (LJAA) board chairman Kārlis Rācenis, Latvian Doctors Association (LAB) president Ilze Aizsilniece and Latvian Free Trade Unions Association chairman Egils Baldzēns are invited to attend the meeting.</p>
      <p>Latest recommendations from the European Commission and OECD urge Latvia to allocate considerable increase of state funding for healthcare in order to improve accessibility and quality. The same is stated in Latvia’s Healthcare Financing Law. However, the government and the Saeima are illegally preparing to worsen healthcare funding in the coming years. Additionally, there are no plans to ensure funding increase for the industry, the trade union states.</p>
      <p>«To prevent this, on 24 October, LVSADA, LAB, LJAA and LMA together with family doctors and organizations representing pharmacists agreed on organization of a joint two-wave tactic protest. The first protest wave was planned to be organized prior to 14 November, when the Saeima plans to vote on the state budget project.»</p>
      <p>The first wave of protests was organized by LAB, LJAA and LMA. LVSADA and other organizations actively supported them.</p>
      <p>The second wave of protests will commence after approval of budget laws in the Saeima. These protests will be longer. This is reserved for a situation if the Saeima, in spite of first wave of protests, decides to vote in favour of a state policy that will worsen accessibility of healthcare and its quality. Following the 24 October agreement, the second wave of protests will be organized by LVSADA with support from public organizations and other trade unions.</p>

      <p>Considering the council’s previous decision made on 15 October and the development of events that followed after, LVSADA has prepared an action plan. The decision in regards to the plan will be made by the council once partners have voiced their opinions.</p>
