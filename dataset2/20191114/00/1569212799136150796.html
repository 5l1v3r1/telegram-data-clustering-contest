      <p>Adobe has announced the general availability of real-time customer data platform (CDP) features, new governance capabilities and new cross-channel personalization methods. These updates to Adobe Experience Platform will allow users to pull together customer data from across the enterprise in real-time.</p>
      <h3>Why we should care</h3>
      <p>Delivering a consistent customer experience across all touchpoints and interactions can be a challenging feat for marketers working with fragmented data and complicated governance structures. Marketers know that they need to establish a single view of each customer, but many brands struggle to leverage that view to deliver advantageous experiences.</p>
      <p>“Customer experience is the new battleground for business. Brands must close the gap between the customer, channels they live and the experience they expect,” said Suresh Vittal, vice president of Adobe Experience Cloud. “Adobe Experience Platform is built to give brands the ability to have a single view of each customer, without the pain of decoding complex interactions across digital and physical touchpoints.”</p>
