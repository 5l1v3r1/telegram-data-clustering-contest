      <h1>The Fondation Cartier In Paris Devotes An Entire Exhibition To Trees As A Call To Action</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Y-Jean Mun-Delsalle</a></address>
      <p>“I wonder if our initial relationship to trees is esthetic rather than scientific. When we come across a beautiful tree, it is an extraordinary thing,” says French biologist-botanist, Francis Hallé, who has traveled the world filling his notebooks with observational drawings of trees. Blending art and science, the <a href="https://www.fondationcartier.com/en/">Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain</a> shines a spotlight on the latest scientific research on trees and encourages us to view them in a new light and not to underestimate their importance in our daily lives. Running until January 5, 2020, the exhibition <i>Trees</i>, co-curated by anthropologist Bruce Albert, Hervé Chandès (Fondation Cartier’s Director) and Isabelle Gaudefroy (Director of Programs and Artistic Projects), is not only a love letter and expression of gratitude to trees and the natural world and the indispensable role they play in man’s existence, but also a call to action in light of pressing ecological issues. It’s not the first time that Fondation Cartier has explored the question of humans’ relationship to nature. In fact, it has been a recurring theme in its exhibition repertoire: for example<i> Yanomami, Spirit of the Forest</i> (2003) or <i>The Great Animal Orchestra</i> (2016).</p>

      <p>Blessed with excellent sensory and memory capabilities and communication skills, living in symbiosis with other species and having a profound effect on the climate, trees boast surprising abilities, which has led to the intriguing hypothesis of “plant intelligence”. Perhaps the solution to many of today’s environmental issues, they could provide us with the keys to our survival. Trees are among the oldest living organisms on earth – the first known fossil forest dates back to 385 million years ago – and the plant world forms 82.5 % of terrestrial biomass. Compare this to humans who are only 300,000 years old and represent just 0.01 % of this organic mass. The way we’ve regarded trees in the 20<sup>th</sup> century – largely mercilessly – has had disturbing consequences on the ecosystem of forests around the world: 80 % of deforested areas have been cleared during this period. Since then, we have been experiencing a phenomenon occurring at two speeds: on one hand, a northern hemisphere that reforests and restores natural habitats, and on the other hand, a southern hemisphere where the wiping out of tropical forests has never been so intense. The rate of deforestation has reached alarming levels. Between 2000 and 2017, 3.4 million square kilometers of forested land were cleared worldwide, cutting global forest cover by 8.4 %, particularly affecting Brazil, Russia, Canada, the United States, Indonesia and Congo. In 2018 alone, tropical regions lost 12 million hectares of tree cover, according to a grim report released by Global Forest Watch last April.</p>

      <p>It is this dichotomy – between increased environmental awareness and the accelerated destruction of tropical forests – that the exhibition describes, while reinstating the tree to its rightful place from which it had been removed by anthropocentrism. It is structured around three narrative themes that enlighten the visitor through different perspectives: the knowledge of trees (from botany to new plant biology), their beauty (from naturalistic contemplation to dreamlike depictions) and their destruction (from documentary evidence to artistic testimonies). Created by artists originating from Latin America, Europe, the US and Iran, as well as those from remote indigenous communities such as the Nivacle and Guaraní from Gran Chaco, Paraguay, and the Yanomami Indians from the Amazonian forest, the artworks offer a wondrous glimpse of these remarkable protagonists of the living world. <i>Trees</i> unites the proposals of those who value and stand in awe of the plant world, for according to Italian philosopher, Emanuele Coccia, “There is nothing purely human, the vegetal exists in all that is human, and the tree is at the origin of all experience.”</p>

      <p>Showcasing photos, drawings, watercolors, paintings, films and installations that investigate the visual beauty and architectural complexity of trees and oppose their annihilation, the exhibition gives voice to a diverse range of individuals – artists, intellectuals and scientists – who have formed a close bond with trees. Based on an idea by the philosopher Paul Virilio, the disappearance of three great tropical forest regions (Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia) and their accompanying cultures and languages is shown dramatically in the video <i>Exit</i> by American architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro, while Paraguayan director Paz Encina offers a dreamlike vision of the tree as a refuge for memory and childhood. French photographer and filmmaker Raymond Depardon’s movie, <i>Mon Arbre</i> (My Tree), paints portraits of the plane, walnut, cypress and oak trees that shade village squares and farms through the words of those who know them best, and to which many memories are linked, encompassing the highly personal and the historical. Having devoted almost 10 years to observing and drawing various species of urban trees throughout the seasons in an extremely methodical manner, Italian architects Cesare Leonardi and Franca Stagi have produced a systematic inventory compiled for the design of urban parks that reveals an intimate knowledge of and empathy for trees. Iranian artist Salim Karami’s unlikely vibrant ballpoint pen drawings highlight the tree of life, emphasizing the connection between the earthly, subterranean and celestial universes.</p>

      <p>Steered more by intuition than scientific rigour, Brazilian artist Luiz Zerbini creates rich, colorful and overgrown landscapes, masterminding the imaginary encounter between trees from tropical botanical gardens and signs of urbanity, giving the viewer the impression of “being in the painting as you could be in a forest”. There’s even a tree growing in the middle of the exhibition space, part of a table-herbarium showcasing various plant specimens gathered during Zerbini’s nature walks, conceived as a living painting. French artist and sower, Fabrice Hyber, has planted 300,000 tree seeds in his valley in Vendée in western France, and offers a lyrical and personal observation of the plant world through his paintings that address rhizome growth, energy and mutation, mobility and metamorphosis. “When I draw a tree,” he writes, “I try to put myself in its skin… its bark clothing. I imagine that it has invisible functions, by analogy with our profoundly human behaviors: like us, the tree can move and communicate with others; it can be crazy or wise, hysterical or calm, depending on the context and the environment.” Colombian artist Johanna Calle’s ghostly silhouettes of trees composed of typed text imbued with messages of deforestation, fragile ecosystems, endemic species and the spoliation of native Amerindian lands on vintage notarial ledgers quietly and delicately evoke the fragility of these gentle giants.</p>

      <p>Fighting for the protection of forests are indigenous peoples who are their traditional inhabitants and most at risk. Residing in an area that is currently undergoing deforestation at an unprecedented rate, the drawings by Paraguayan Nivacle and Guaraní artists Jorge Carema, Esteban Klassen, Efacio Álvarez, Marcos Ortiz and Clemente Juliuz illustrate how the forest was once the natural habitat of countless animal species like jaguars, peccaries and herons and the source of subsistence living, showing how human and nonhuman beings can effectively cohabit. Three Yanomami artists, Kalepi, Joseca and Ehuana Yaira, depict the trees they live with, whose fruits, leaves and bark they use for food, medicine and shamanic rituals, evoking a “forest-world” populated by visible and invisible beings. Also portraying the Amazonian rainforest, Brazilian photographer Cássio Vasconcellos draws on the representations of early European explorers and the astonishment they felt faced with the mysteries of this jungle. On view is a representation of a religious tradition and Brazilian folk art with sculpted wood ex-voto of body parts that have been healed and placed in a church in recognition of the granting of miracles, while Brazilian artist Afonso Tostes’ series of tools spread along an entire wall feature carved wooden handles recalling the bones of the human body articulated like the branches of a tree to which the wood once belonged.</p>

      <p>The exhibition naturally extends to the garden of the Fondation Cartier, which was created in 1994 by artist Lothar Baumgarten. Visitors wander among the trees, including the graceful Lebanese cedar planted by Chateaubriand in 1823, which had inspired the building’s architect Jean Nouvel to design a transparent and reflective architecture, where inside and outside meet seamlessly. Making the invisible visible, Stefano Mancuso, Italian botanist, pioneer of plant neurobiology and proponent of the concept of plant intelligence, teams up with Dutch artist Thijs Biersteker in their installation <i>Symbiosia</i>, which creates a tree ring every second based on the measurement of growth patterns and disruptions caused by environmental impact in real time through a dozen sensors placed on two living trees, thereby allowing them to speak. Hidden amidst the greenery is Giuseppe Penone’s <i>Biforcazione </i>bronze tree sculpture bearing an imprint of the Italian artist’s hand on its trunk, commissioned by the Fondation Cartier back in 1987. Specially imagined for this exhibition is a tree stump moved from the late French filmmaker Agnès Varda’s garden in Paris, topped by a replica of her cat Nini, meant to signify a poetic synthesis of all the trees “that matter in our lives: the cherry tree in the garden, the weeping willow on the way to the market, a giant cedar under which I loved to sit, and the trees here and there, whom we often greet in passing”.</p>
