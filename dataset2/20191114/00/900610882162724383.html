      <h1>Emirates upgrades its mobile app with 'Airport Maps' feature</h1>

      <p>Travellers with Emirates’ mobile app might now find it easier to find check-in desks, Emirates lounges, shops and other touch points at select airports worldwide.</p>
      <p>The airline has launched a new feature on its app called Airport Maps, which it said will allow customers to navigate seamlessly through airports. The new feature, which offers live navigation, can detect the user’s location via Bluetooth and wifi and provide point to point navigation through touch points of the airport including check-in desks, Emirates lounges, shops, restaurants or ATMs in the airport. Passengers can also search for their gate through the app.</p>

      <p>The new addition to the Emirates app maps out Emirates’ hub – Dubai International Airport’s Terminal 3 – and also includes major airports in the Emirates network: London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Hong Kong International Airport.</p>
      <p>Emirates said its app, offered in 19 languages, currently has 1.5 million active users each month and allows customers to search, book and manage their flights as well as their Emirates Skywards accounts.</p>
      <p>Last year, Emirates introduced 3D seat models, a form of web virtual reality (VR) technology on its digital platform. The 3D seat model is a visualisation of a 3D 360-degree view of the interior of the Emirates A380 and all the Emirates B777 aircraft types. Emirates’ app also added a feature that lets customers create bespoke playlists of their inflight entertainment ahead of their travels and sync it to their seats once on board.</p>
