      <h1>Cybersecurity Is An Asset, Not A Nuisance</h1>

      <p>We just celebrated <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month">National Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a>, but perhaps we should rename it Cybersecurity Action Month. While most businesses know cybersecurity is important, many fall short when it comes to implementing security initiatives — even when there’s knowledge staring them in the face. According to a recent survey from Ponemon Institute, only <a href="https://www.bmc.com/forms/vulnerability-ponemon-survey-analyst-report.html?cid=ps-DSO_NA_Security_Ponemon_Report_AR_Google_US-BS-05-f-4012019&amp;cc=ps&amp;adch=ggl&amp;adcat=dso&amp;elqcid=8859&amp;sfcid=7011O0000038Hn2&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9IW458La5AIVqh6tBh1m-QhTEAAYAiAAEgJr-vD_BwE">42%</a> of respondents have a high level of confidence in their organization’s ability to handle IT security risks.Often, perspective is to blame. Company leaders think of cybersecurity as extra protection “just in case,” a costly investment of time and funds. In reality, it’s a key asset that can improve efficiency and minimize the chances of business grinding to a halt when — not if — a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/16/the-cyber-threats-every-company-should-know-about/#2797f10610c2">cybersecurity issue</a> arises.</p>
      <p>A good way to think about cybersecurity is to compare it to the brakes on a race car. It’s the brakes that truly make the speed possible. Without them, the speed would be pure recklessness.</p>

      <h3>Cybersecurity Doesn’t Have to Be a Headache</h3>
      <p>Like anything worth doing, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2018/09/04/think-you-have-cybersecurity-taken-care-of-think-again/#1cc9bfb93839">implementing cybersecurity measures</a> requires an investment of time and money. But it doesn’t have to be an arduous process. A few strategies can ease the way.</p>
      <h4>1. Educate your entire team.</h4>
      <p>Cybersecurity begins with employee education. Considering that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/the-biggest-cybersecurity-risk-to-us-businesses-is-employee-negligence-study-says.html">employees are the root of most data breaches</a>, usually by accident, a failure to conduct training is a major oversight. At the very least, employees must know how to recognize threats and understand that seemingly innocuous actions — such as sharing passwords or accessing work files on their personal devices — leave them vulnerable.</p>
      <p>Leaders also need to be informed of the very real, very high risks of cyberattacks and the reverberating effects should their companies be caught unprepared. When your leaders understand this, they’ll have an easier time <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrylibert/2017/10/08/most-leaders-fail-at-capital-allocation/#533d8943634c">allocating their departments’ resources</a> for cybersecurity initiatives.</p>
      <p>Luckily, cybersecurity training doesn’t have to mean shutting down the office for an entire day. Combine blocks of in-person training with refreshers online or via a mobile app to help employees efficiently retain information. Cybersecurity training must also be done on a regular basis — once a year won’t cut it. The online world evolves rapidly, meaning consistently updating employees with the latest information is the only way to stay ahead of threats.</p>
      <h4>2. Help IT teams keep up.</h4>
      <p>IT teams are under enormous pressure to keep up with changing tech trends. The list of <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends/2019/executive-summary.html">current tech capabilities</a> is long and growing by the day — right-speed IT, blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, machine learning, and advanced analytics are just a few examples of technologies that IT teams are expected to be experts in.</p>
      <p>While businesses are happy to invest in the technology itself, they often neglect to likewise invest in the team making it all work. A Business Reality Check survey found that upwards of <a href="https://businessrealities.eiu.com/in-brief-managing-the-pace-of-technological-change">40% of senior executives</a> are increasing spending on tech, but fewer are investing in tech talent. As a result, many IT teams are stranded in firefighting mode, cleaning up after attacks, mitigating vulnerabilities, and improving security defenses rather than leveraging new technology to its full strategic potential.</p>
      <p>To solve this problem, organizations are turning to cybersecurity automation. A 2019 Domain Tools/Ponemon survey found that 53% of respondents don’t have enough staff to monitor their organization’s cyberthreats 24/7, and <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/04/16/it-security-automation-skills/">60% believed automation</a> will be used in the next few years for threat hunting. Automating threat detection, for instance, can help IT teams keep up more efficiently, enabling them to fight fewer fires and focus on projects that will help grow the business.</p>
      <h4>3. Opt to outsource.</h4>
      <p>Another option for boosting your cybersecurity is to outsource some of your efforts. Small businesses especially need to consider getting outside help; hackers consider small organizations easy targets. In fact, a 2017 Ponemon Institute report found that more than <a href="https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2018/07/when-should-you-outsource-cybersecurity">60% of small and mid-sized businesses</a> experienced a cyberattack the year prior, an increase from previous years.</p>
      <p>If you opt to outsource cybersecurity, you’ll be in good company: 65% of chief information security officers have outsourced <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/finance/us-the-future-of-cyber-survey.pdf">21%-30% of their cyber efforts</a>, according to Deloitte’s 2019 Future of Cyber Survey. To find a reputable cybersecurity firm, start by getting recommendations from industry peers. Ask for references, and actually call them. Make sure to discuss compliance requirements, including how the firm handles compliance reporting and audits.</p>
      <p>Of course, no single vendor can know everything about cybersecurity. Businesses can and should learn from their peers by utilizing crowdsourcing platforms. Indeni is a peer-reviewed platform that provides security infrastructure automation with <a href="https://indeni.com/indeni-improves-visibility-increases-time-savings-for-security-ops/?utm_campaign=1909%20-%207.0%20Launch&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=77024763&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8T3kuazc2b8vQh1ItEUDR0JvYt-Nzw0eFunHH4iwcjmRVs0-Wis0580jJHPRmlFwz9HwEcPeyjcYaTRCtJKJmV-SeWb6SccniEFY9NiMLswwASz48&amp;_hsmi=77025098">auto-triage capabilities</a>, while HackerOne relies on the global hacker community to <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/taking-guesswork-out-of-vulnerability-reporting">find bugs or vulnerabilities</a>; Polyswarm.io <a href="https://polyswarm.io/how_it_works/">crowdsources threat detection</a>. These platforms help companies get ahead of risks and enhance their security.</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity is a worthy investment, and employees should learn to think of it as a tool, not a boring administrative evil. By strategically training employees, automating where it makes sense, and outsourcing some of the burden, growing companies can operate at their best. Being free from worry and able to focus not only on protecting what you have, but also growing your business, is an asset.</p>
