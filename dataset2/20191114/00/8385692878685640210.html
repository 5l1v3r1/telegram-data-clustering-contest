      <p>Disney+ already has more than 10 million subscribers.</p>
      <p>This is in spite of the service only having been available for one day and still limited to select countries.</p>
      <p>The number beats previous expectations signalling the service will continue to see rapid growth as it expands to more places.</p>

      <h3>Disney+ outdoing already high expectations</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/getting-started-with-disney-plus-devices-best+features-explained">Disney+</a> was always expected to make a splash when it arrived. Even prior to the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/Disney+plus+Streaming+Service+launch">launch</a> it was clear there was enormous interest with Disney+ racking up almost 2 million subscribers through pre-orders alone.</p>
      <p>However, the real test was always going to be what number the service settled on at the end of the first day. That number has now been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/disney-surpasses-10-million-sign-ups-since-launch.html">confirmed</a> by Disney as 10 million.</p>
      <p>This is only the start of things to come considering Disney+ is still only available in select countries. The company has already confirmed Disney+ will go live in many European countries on March 31, 2020.</p>

      <p>The United Kingdom, Germany, and France are all part of that European launch and you can expect another instant subscriber boost to take place at that time.</p>
      <p>Long before then, the next big test will come in a matter of days.</p>
      <h3>Disney's next big test coming soon</h3>
      <p>Impressive as it is that Disney+ has amassed so many subscribers and so quickly, these are not paid subscribers yet.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Disney+ offers a <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/beey9">seven-day free trial</a> and the majority of the 10 million are currently taking advantage of the free period.</p>
      <p>Next week those trials will come to an end leaving subscribers with the choice of canceling their subscription or converting to a paid subscription. How many subscribers the service has then will be a truer indication of how well Disney+ streaming is doing.</p>
      <p>The price is one of the ways Disney hopes to reduce the number of subscribers from cancelling.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>At just $6.99 per month, Disney is significantly cheaper than many other services, including Netflix.</p>
      <p>Adding to this, Disney+ has also made a play for the value beyond the sign-up price. For example, unlike other services, Disney+ does not offer any complicated plans or upgrades.</p>
      <p>Instead, Disney+ comes loaded with every feature Disney has to offer included in the base price. This includes 4K, unlimited downloads, up to four streams at the same time, and more.</p>

      <p>Of course, having access to the Star Wars, Marvel, Nat Geo and The Simpsons back catalogs helps as well. As does the ability to stream years and years of Disney classics.</p>
