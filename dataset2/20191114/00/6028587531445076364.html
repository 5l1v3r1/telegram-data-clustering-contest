      <h1>AMD Ryzen 9 3950X Review: A Shockingly Fast, Brilliant Processor</h1>

      <p>Despite being launched in July, AMD's highly anticipated Ryzen 9 3950X is finally here and will be available later this month. Today, though, we can finally talk about just how fast this 16-core, 32-thread processor is it is and I've put it through a bunch of game and content creation benchmarks to see if this really is the fastest and most powerful mainstream desktop CPU ever, specifically against the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2018/11/29/intel-core-i9-9980xe-review-18-core-monster-processor-tested-against-amds-threadripper/">Core i9-9980XE </a>and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2018/08/13/amd-32-core-threadripper-2990wx-and-16-core-2950x-reviews-most-powerful-ever-desktop-processors/">Threadripper 2950X</a>.</p>

      <p>As well as having the highest core and thread count of any current mainstream CPU and bettering many in both AMD and Intel's high-end desktop lineups, the Ryzen 9 3950X also has the highest boost frequency of any 3rd Gen Ryzen CPU at 4.7GHz. It also has the largest amount of cache at 72MB and a full 4 cores and 8 threads more than the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/07/07/amd-ryzen-9-3900x-and-ryzen-7-3700x-review-old-ryzen-owners-look-away-now/">Ryzen 9 3900X</a>. This should make it the fastest AMD CPU in lightly-threaded tasks such as games as well as the most potent mainstream CPU in multi-threaded workloads too.</p>

      <p>Once it hits the shelves it should be available for less than $800 and hopefully less than that in pounds or Euros, but we'll have to wait and see what happens once it's actually available or those pre-orders go live for definite pricing. I also won't be going in to too much technical detail here as I've already covered this in my <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2019/06/10/amd-3rd-gen-ryzen-deep-dive-essential-guide-whats-new-and-performance-boosting-features/#2879fcaf283d">original launch articles</a>. Today is all about how this CPU performance, especially against the Core i9-9980XE and Threadripper 2950X.</p>
      <p>One thing I should mention, is that the Ryzen 9 3950X lacks a cooler in the box. You'll need to buy your own and if you're spending over $700 on a processor that's hopefully not too much of a shock.</p>

        <figcaption>MY CPU test system<cite>Antony Leather</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I've rebuilt my test systems so they use cutting-edge components and also fully up to date versions of Windows 10 with the May 1903 update along with all the various security patches - both from motherboard manufacturers and Microsoft as these are known to have impacted on performance making any data obtained prior to these updates incomparable and unrepresentative.</p>
      <p>I should also point out that I've used 3466MHz memory with all my systems now as this worked with older AMD CPUs as well as new ones, painting them in their best light, especially given memory prices are so low at the moment. You may see slightly better performance using faster memory, but you'll be unlikely to get that working on 1st Gen Ryzen CPUs.</p>

        <b>Gaming Benchmarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</b>
      </p>
      <p>Starting with Shadow of the Tomb Raider and the Ruzen 9 3950X makes some small gains over the rest of the Zen 2 CPU range, but not massively so. Intel is still quicker, most notably with the Core i9-9980XE and Core i9-9900KS, even with a graphics card that's a fair bit less powerful than the likes of the RTX 2080 Ti. Unsurprisingly, the Ryzen 9 3950X was a little quicker at stock speed thanks to it retaining that 4.7GHz boost frequency - lost when you apply a manual overclock.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Far Cry 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>AMD has been consistently closing gaps, though, and Far Cry 5 barely sees any benefit by opting for Intel. In fact, the Ryzen 9 3950X was faster than the Core i9-9980XE and even matched the Core i9-9900KS's 99th percentile minimum frame rate at stock speed too. Only the overclocked 9700K, 9900K and 9900KS were able to offer noticeably higher frame rates and the Ryzen 9 3950X stood head and shoulders above previous generation AMD CPUs too, with a massive lead over the Threadripper 2950X.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Dota 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>At higher frame rates in easier-to-play games, the AMD CPU is still fast, but in DotA 2 at least, Intel has a lead but only from the Core i9-9900K and above and often only once overclocked too, with the Core i9-9980XE managing similar frame rates at stock speed. Unless you're a professional player, these differences will likely be unnoticeable.</p>

        <b>Content creation benchmarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Adobe Premiere Pro</b>
      </p>
      <p>This one was a surprise for me as I'd honestly expected the Ryzen 9 3950X to top the chart here given its dominance elsewhere. It managed to better every other mainstream CPU and by a noticeably margin, but both the Threadripper 2950X and Core i9-9980XE were quicker, with their high-end desktop platforms clearly benefiting the test in some way and Intel probably enjoying its extra Adobe optimization. It's a great result, but for Premiere users, it's not particularly clear cut, especially with far cheaper Intel HEDT CPUs just around the corner.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Cinebench R20</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ryzen 9 3900X and Core i9-9900KS both had stellar single-threaded results in Cienebench but the pinnacle of the Zen 2 architecture in the Ryzen 9 3950X bettered them both, which is a far cry from the 1st Gen Ryzen. Just look at how much slower the Ryzen 7 1800X is in last place. That's a dramatic performance improvement just two generations down the line.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The multi-threaded result is a triumph for AMD'snew flagship, clearly bettering the Core i9-9980XE and while Cinebench isn't exactly a popular program amongst PC enthusiasts, it usually sets the scene for other real-world tests such as HandBrake below. The Intel CPU managed to come within spitting distance when overclocked, but rhe Ryzen 9 3950X was clearly faster at stock speed.</p>

        <b>HandBrake</b>
      </p>
      <p>This was a monster result for AMD, with the Ryzen 9 3900X already doing pretty well at stock speed but losing out to the overclocked Core i9-9980XE. Nothing I tested got close to the Ryzen 9 3950X and the overclocked Core i9-9980XE was still a long way behind.</p>

        <b>PC Mark 10 Image Editing</b>
      </p>
      <p>This test always seems to love AMD CPUs and the Ryzen 9 3950X extended the Ryzen 9 3900X's lead here with an unassailable score at stock speed and when overclocked.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>
        <b>Power Consumption</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps the most astounding result of all is the Ryzen 9 3950X's power efficiency compared to both the Threadripper 2950X and Core i9-9980XE. The latter drew 397W under load at stock speed compared to just 242W for the Ryzen 9 3950X - a huge difference for what was often better or similar performance. Once overclocked, the difference was even larger, with the Intel CPU skyrocketing to a system power reading of 575W compared to just 340W for the AMD system. Admittedly, this is where Intel claws back a lot of ground, but it does so with a huge detriment to power consumption.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Make no mistake. Despite a couple of slower-than-expected results and lack of huge gains in games versus the rest of the Zen 2 CPUs in the graphs, The Ryzen 9 3950X is a monster. For the most part it has the measure of Intel's vastly more expensive Core i9-9980XE and coupled with power efficiency that's in a different league, the only reason you should be considering Intel's Cascade Lake-X CPUs (essentially a refresh of the 9000-series with slightly higher frequencies), is for a Premier Pro-specific system or if you need the extra memory channels and PCI-E lanes it provides.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>What I love about the Ryzen 9 3950X is that it not only brings high-end desktop performance to the mainstream, but it does so for a reasonable price and extremely low power consumption too. If you're worried your existing cooler won't cope with a 16-core CPU such as this, you'd probably be surprised and the same certainly cannot be said for the Core 9-9980XE. At stock speed, a 120mm liquid cooler would cope fine as would a decent air cooler, although, things get much warmer once you start overclocking.</p>
      <p>Overall the the Ryzen 9 3950X is as stunning as it is disruptive in terms of performance. It's forced Intel to drop its prices in a big way, offers incredible multi-threaded performance for the money and is compatible with older AM4 motherboards too. You won't see big gains over other 3rd Gen Ryzen CPUs in games and most lightly-threaded tasks, but if you mix content creation with gaming and don't want to step up to a high-end desktop platform, it's currently the best CPU by far and the most impressive yet from the Zen 2 architecture. Great job AMD.</p>
