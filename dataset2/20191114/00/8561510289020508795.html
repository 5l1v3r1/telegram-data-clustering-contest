      <h1>Elon Musk Claims Neuralink Can “Solve” Autism, Schizophrenia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T00:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <p>On a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40&amp;feature=youtu.be">recent podcast appearance</a>, Neuralink CEO Elon Musk claimed that the company’s experimental <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-brain-computer-interface-coming-soon">brain-computer interface</a> technology would be able to “solve” neurological diseases.</p>
      <p>In the past, Musk has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-neuralink-implants-link-brains-to-internet-next-year-2019-7">suggested</a> that Neuralink could help with serious conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, but now he’s added a bizarre new example to the list: autism spectrum disorder.</p>
      <p>“So Neuralink, I think at first will solve a lot of brain-related diseases,” Musk said on the “Artificial Intelligence” podcast with Lex Fridman. “So could be anything from like autism, schizophrenia, memory loss — like everyone experiences memory loss at certain points in age. Parents can’t remember their kids’ names and that kind of thing.”</p>
      <p>As <i><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-said-neuralink-could-solve-autism-and-schizophrenia-2019-11">Business Insider </a></i><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-said-neuralink-could-solve-autism-and-schizophrenia-2019-11">reports</a>, autism is considered a developmental disorder, not a brain disease that can or necessarily <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/autism-rates-rising">should be “cured.”</a></p>
      <p>But because Musk didn’t elaborate, it’s not clear whether he misunderstands what autism is or whether he was merely rattling off a list of well-known conditions to advocate for <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/people-begging-elon-musk-skull">Neuralink’s future capabilities</a>.</p>
      <p>While schizophrenia can be a debilitating mental condition, autism is more tightly linked to a sense of identity — and listing it as a disease to be solved as Musk did risks further stigmatizing a community pushing for <a href="https://futurism.com/deep-pressure-transform-lives-autism">better treatment and representation</a>.</p>
