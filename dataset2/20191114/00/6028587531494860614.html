      <p>Facebook announced three new products on Thursday that will make it easier for people to donate to charities and causes they want to support. The products include a new fundraiser sticker for Facebook Stories, a donate button for Instagram business accounts and a donate button for video game live-streamer accounts.The updates push Facebook deeper into online charitable donations industry, which is currently dominated by incumbents GoFundMe and Paypal—both of which charge a 2.9% payment-processing fee on each donation, in addition to 30 cents for every donation. Facebook does not charge a fee on any donations.</p>
      <p>“Before Facebook, we were nickel-and-diming fundraisers through Paypal and getting a percentage taken,” said Military Mama Network founder Geriann Wiesbrook at the Facebook product unveiling on Thursday. “I don’t know who came up with the [automated monthly donations] thing, but that was also a game-changer because our monthly donors are going up.”</p>
      <p>The nonprofit donations industry is a fringe business that quietly generates billions of dollars each year. In 2018, more than 55 million people used Paypal to give <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90394936/giving-on-paypal-has-bucked-the-recent-downward-trends-for-philanthropy">$9.6 billion to nonprofits</a>. Since 2010, GoFundMe has been used to raised <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/c/about-us">more than $5 billion</a>. Facebook, by comparison, has helped individuals and organizations raise <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/2-billion-for-causes/">more than $2 billion</a> since 2015.</p>
      <p>The new donation tools play an important role in Facebook’s growing reach in digital payments and its increased emphasis on groups and private messaging. Although the company may not derive a direct monetary value from donations, the tools encourage people to continue messaging, organizing, and engaging with like-minded people on Facebook.</p>
      <p>In a speech at Facebook’s annual developers’ conference in May, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he wants users to have more conversations in groups and showcased a new look that <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/f8-2019-day-1/">put groups at the center of the Facebook app</a>. Adding the ability for groups to promote and collect donations on Facebook furthers this goal.</p>
