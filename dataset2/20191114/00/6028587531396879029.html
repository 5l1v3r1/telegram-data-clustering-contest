      <p>Slightly more than two out of five investors are optimistic about the short-term direction of stock prices for the second consecutive week. The latest AAII Sentiment Survey also shows a modest increase in pessimism and a decline in neutral sentiment.Bullish sentiment, expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six months, is 0.4 percentage points higher at 40.7%. Optimism was last higher on May 8, 2019 (43.1%). Bullish sentiment is above its historical average of 38.0% for just the tenth time this year.</p>
      <p>Neutral sentiment, expectations that stock prices will stay essentially unchanged over the next six months, declined 1.3 percentage points to 34.5%. Even with the decline, neutral sentiment is above its historical average of 31.5% for the 25th time in 26 weeks.</p>
      <p>Bearish sentiment, expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months, rose 0.9 percentage points to 24.8%. Pessimism is below its historical average of 30.5% for a fourth consecutive week.</p>
      <p>As stated above, bullish sentiment is above 40% for the second consecutive week. This has not happened since August 29, 2018, and September 5, 2018 (43.5% and 42.2%, respectively). Since then optimism has only been above its historical average on consecutive weeks two other times: February 20, 2019, and February 27, 2019, (39.3% and 41.6%, respectively); and May 1, 2019, and May 8, 2019 (39.0% and 43.1%, respectively).</p>
      <p>At current levels, all three indicators are within their typical ranges.</p>
      <p>The improvement in optimism occurred as the major indexes set new record highs. Many individual investors continue to monitor trade negotiations, particularly between the U.S. and China. Also having an influence on sentiment are Washington politics, geopolitics, valuations, corporate earnings, economic growth, monetary policy and interest rates.</p>
      <p>This week’s special question asked AAII members what their thoughts were regarding the S&amp;P 500 index reaching a new record high. Opinions on the new highs are overwhelmingly split, with approximately 43% of respondents viewing the new highs as unsustainable and due for a correction. Some respondents in this group believe that the record-breaking highs are a sign of the tail end of the bull run. On the other hand, 38% of respondents say that the S&amp;P 500 highs are appropriate given current interest rates and limited investment opportunities outside of equities. A majority of this group also state that they believe the S&amp;P 500 will continue to rise well into 2020. Additionally, 11% of respondents say the new highs are in response to developing trade resolution talks and 8% state that they have no opinion on the matter.</p>
      <p>Here is a sampling of the responses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“The economy is strong, and stockholders are optimistic. The yield on bonds is low limiting investment options.”</li>
        <li>“False sense of security despite highly volatile geopolitical/economic conditions.”</li>
        <li>“I have no thoughts. This is just another number. As long as corporations continue to spend the money to buy back their stocks, earnings will continue to be supported by fewer shares traded.”</li>
        <li>“No other place to put money to get a decent return, so equities are the best. Even though the markets are high, one wonders how long equities can go without overpricing.”</li>
        <li>“The S&amp;P 500 has achieved record highs over the last week. History suggests that that might reverse soon.”</li>
      </ul>
