      <h1>Natural Gas: Strap Down, The Ride Isn’t Over</h1>

      <p>A couple of weeks back, we explored in <a href="https://www.investing.com/analysis/natural-gas-experts-follow-the-money-forget-the-cold-200480560">this column</a> the wild bronco ride that natural gas can be.</p>
      <p>After five out of six weeks in the red, gas futures on New York’s Henry Hub suddenly turned parabolic, leaving bulls with an 18% gain. Of course, the very nature of volatile markets are that what goes up often comes down. So, here we are this week, staring at a near 4% loss, at the time of writing at least.</p>

      <p>And if gas is to live to its mercurial moods, it’d be safe to assume there’d be more swings in the coming days and weeks. Those convinced about a freezing late November/early December will be battling wits with others who think the market is overhyped on the weather at least in the near-term, and needs to go lower.</p>
      <h3>All Eyes On $2.50 Support</h3>
      <p>With Henry Hub’s <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/natural-gas">front-month December contract</a> hitting two-week lows at $2.571 per million metric British thermal units in Wednesday’s session, some analysts think the imminent battle would be fought over the $2.50 per mmBtu support.<br/><br/>“Although demand remains elevated … the return of near- and above-average temperatures to areas of the eastern U.S. next week will diminish the need for heating,” said Dan Myers, analyst at Houston-based gas risk consultancy Gelber &amp; Associates. “With this in mind, NYMEX natural gas futures are looking beyond the immediate cold spell."<br/><br/>With benchmark December futures’ test below $2.60 on Wednesday, Myers said, “similar 1% losses permeate down the curve into the 2020 strip, as next year’s average futures price slips back below $2.50.”<br/><br/>The make or break of the $2.50 support could hinge on what the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports as weekly difference for <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/natural-gas-storage-386">gas storage</a> in data due at 11:00 AM ET today. A trade consensus puts gas storage build for the week ended Nov. 8 at 45 billion cubic feet versus the previous week’s surprisingly small 34 bcf.</p>
      <h3>Could The Market’s Red Line Extend?</h3>
      <p>Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, thinks the market’s recent red line could extend a little longer if more hedge funds, also known as Commodity Trading Advisors, turn sellers due to cold weather that doesn’t impress.</p>
      <p>Said Shelton:</p>
      <blockquote>“Bottom line to me is that the market is still on its way to 2.50 and the Q1 spreads should continue to flatten.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“I think CTAs are flat here in general, though some of the momentum based systems are likely getting short again. We saw selling in weather-related markets yesterday which is a sign that there is selling NG on their computer based systems as well."</blockquote>
      <p>But Shelton also said weather models over the 11-15 day period were somewhat supportive, and that could discourage an extensive downside.</p>
      <p>He adds:</p>
      <blockquote>“I would think there are short term CTA sellers in the market lately, but not the major sellers seen on a trend change. I think to get them short again, it will take more time and weakness as the don’t flip back that easily.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Moderate Cold Theme</h3>
      <p>Dominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at the Energy Management Institute of New York, concurs on the moderate cold theme.</p>
      <p>“Temperatures should not stray too far from normal in either direction across most of the US for days 11-15,” said Chirichella. “The best chance of warm anomalies will be across the interior West through the southern US where modest warm anomalies are maintained.”</p>
      <p>Myers said bulls who’ve been on the back foot lately will attempt a comeback if the EIA storage data comes close to matching last week’s smallish bull.</p>
      <p>“However, near-normal temperatures expected in subsequent weeks will allow record production to push back and curb withdrawals in the second half of November,” he added.</p>
