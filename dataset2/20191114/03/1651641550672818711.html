      <p>Spotify has released their official app for Magic Leap One mixed reality device. This new app takes advantage of the power spatial computing to bring your favorite bands and artists to life in the world around you. Since the app is spatially aware, you can pin recently played artists, albums or tracks to specific locations in your home.</p>
      <blockquote>Share your sofa with up-and-coming bands, meet your idols in your kitchen, explore new albums in your garage.</blockquote>
      <p>Since this app supports background music service, you can continue to listen to your music even when you are using other apps on Magic Leap One. You can learn more about this new app from the source link below.</p>
