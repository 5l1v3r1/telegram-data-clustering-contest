      <h1>Chris Smalling says he 'misses Man Utd' as he nears permanent transfer exit</h1>
      <h2>Smalling's Manchester United contract expires in the summer - but Roma loan could become permanent move as defender targets silverware with Serie A side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:42:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:42</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Chris Smalling has admitted he 'misses Manchester United' - but says he is 'settled' in Italy as a permanent Old Trafford exit looms.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chris-smalling">Smalling</a> was shipped out on loan to Roma for the season as United ended up with a glut of centre-backs following the £80million summer signing of Harry Maguire.</p>
      <p>The defender's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> contract expires in the summer, but having established himself in Roma's starting line-up he may yet be offered a permanent deal with the Serie A side.</p>
      <p>Asked if he missed United, the 29-year-old told <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146379/smalling-i-miss-united">Football Italia</a> : "I do because I was there for so many years and I was used to be being part of the furniture there.</p>
      <p>“But I am enjoying my new chapter, and hopefully I can keep affecting performances on the pitch and we can have a successful season. But right now I’m really enjoying being in Italy."</p>

      <p>Smalling said he and his family are happy in Italy, and he is already starting to master the language.</p>
      <p>“I’m starting to pick up things the manager is saying in Italian, and even with the players I’m lucky as quite a few of them speak English," he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m definitely picking up a lot of football phrases and a lot of basic phrases that are helping me interact with the team on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I am feeling very settled; my family is over here and the dogs are over here, so everyone is settled. When my family are happy and I am happy it shows on the pitch."</p>

      <p>Smalling said he had bought into boss Paulo Fonseca's mission to win silverware with Roma this season.</p>
      <p>“The manager’s targets are not just about getting back in the Champions League," said Smalling. "It is about winning something.</p>
      <p>“That is where my full focus is, and come the end of the season when we’ve won something and achieved something we can see where it goes.</p>
      <p>“Right now it is all about focus on the pitch.”</p>
