      <p>VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis is demanding that Facebook, Apple, Google and other tech companies urgently take measures to remove child porn from the web and to prevent children from accessing pornography online.</p>
      <p>Francis told a Vatican conference of religious leaders and high-tech representatives Thursday that it’s no longer acceptable to merely follow the law in monitoring online content, since technology is fast outpacing regulation.</p>
      <p>Rather, he demanded that companies themselves assume a moral responsibility to protect young people from what he said were the ruinous effects of pornography on their emotional and sexual development.</p>
      <p>He said: “There is a need to ensure that investors and managers remain accountable, so that the good of minors and society is not sacrificed to profit.”</p>
      <p>Francis was addressing participants at the conference “Promoting Digital Child Dignity.”</p>
