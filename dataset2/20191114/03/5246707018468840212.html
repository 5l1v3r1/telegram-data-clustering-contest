      <p>This week, we <i>finally</i> got to see the redesigned version of <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamegear/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></b> in a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/video_oh_boy_sonics_movie_redesign_is_revealed_in_brand_new_trailer">new trailer</a> for his upcoming movie.</p>
      <p>We even followed this up with a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/gallery_sonic_movie_trailer_comparison_pics_-_check_out_before_and_after_sonics_redesign">gallery</a> â€“ comparing the original trailer to the new one, to help show the drastic improvements that had been made to the blue blur's design. Part of the change was a pair of new shoes. While the brand is still Puma, these new kicks now actually resemble the ones Sonic wears in the video games.</p>
      <p>If you've always wanted to run as fast as Sonic, you <i>might</i> soon be able to. During an <a href="https://twitter.com/PUMA/status/1194593943079530496">exchange on Twitter</a> recently, a Sonic fan asked Puma when Sonic's <i>new</i> movie kicks would be up for pre-order. This was the German footwear company's reply:</p>
      <blockquote>Hey, stay tuned to PUMA.com for release updates.</blockquote>
      <p>As generic as this might sound, it was seemingly enough to send Sonic fans into a frenzy. Now, all we need is for another brand to distribute his gloves.</p>
