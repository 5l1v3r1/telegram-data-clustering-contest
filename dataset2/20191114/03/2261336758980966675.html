      <h1>Tyson Fury open to ‘crossover’ boxing fight with UFC champ Stipe Miocic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Davies</a></address>
      <p>Lineal boxing heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has said he would gladly welcome UFC champ Stipe Miocic into the boxing ring for a fight.</p>
      <p>Fury, 31, is undefeated in the boxing ring with a record of 30-0-1. “The Gypsy King” has picked up wins in 2019 over Tom Schwarz and Otto Wallin, and is likely to rematch Deontay Wilder at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>Although Miocic has shown interest in stepping into the boxing ring in the past, the UFC heavyweight champ doesn’t have a professional boxing fight to his name. Miocic told Ariel Helwani on Monday he is more keen on boxing Fury next then rematching Daniel Cormier in the UFC.</p>
      <p>“Stipe says he wants to box me; that would be a good fight for sure,” Fury told <a href="https://mtkglobal.com/mtk-global/fury-accepts-challenge-from-miocic/">MTK Global</a>. “After I get Wilder out of the way, I’ll fight Stipe in a boxing match if he wants it. It would be a big crossover fight like Mayweather and McGregor. I’m open to that fight, so he should come and see me. It would be the same outcome for any of them: They’ll all get smashed.”</p>
      <p>In hope of eventually making an appearance in MMA, Fury trained with UFC middleweight Darren Till this weekend and <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956119/video-tyson-fury-train-darren-till-move-mma-dana-white-attention-ufc-news-boxing?fbclid=IwAR26QtyFEDNtHzoiRGZ6q8UJboJGxfjvgNlSdh_LvWjxWNEmODtQgJZvqz8">looked somewhat impressive</a> firing off elbows and knees on the pads with “The Gorilla.”</p>
      <p>“It was exciting training with Darren Till and we get on like a house on fire,” Fury said. “He put me through a hard training session and it was really good.”</p>
