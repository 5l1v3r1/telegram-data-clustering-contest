      <h1>Divers retrieve hundreds of bottles of booze from a World War I shipwreck</h1>

      <p>In 1917, Swedish steamer ship Kyros was traveling from France to Russia when a German U-boat sunk it in the Baltic Sea. The shipwreck was discovered in 1999 but it wasn't until the last month that a team of divers from Ocean X and iXplorer have hauled up the sunken treasure: 600 bottles of De Haartman &amp; Co. cognac and 300 bottles of Benedictine (now Bacardi) liqueur meant for Tsar Nicholas II. From <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/tsars-last-shipment-booze-recovered-baltic-sea-180973547/">Smithsonian</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>(Expedition leader Peter) Lindberg and his colleagues have sent samples of both the cognac and the Benedictine to a laboratory to gauge whether the alcohol is still fit for consumption. They are optimistic regarding the outcome of these tests, according to Metcalfe, as the Baltic’s freezing waters are actually ideal for storing spirits. Although some of the bottles contain sediment, many remain sealed. Several cognac bottles even have intact tin seals...<br/><br/>As Lindberg tells <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/world/shipwreck-liquor-salvage-trnd/index.html">CNN</a>’s Gianluca Mezzofiore and David Williams, he and the rest of the team detected a slight scent of sweetened herbs coming from the Benedictine bottles...<br/><br/>Earlier this year, two bottles of 17th-century wine discovered by Ocean X went up for auction at Christie’s. And in 2011, a 200-year-old bottle of champagne found in another Baltic shipwreck sold for a record-breaking $43,000.</blockquote>
