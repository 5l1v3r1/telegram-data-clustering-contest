      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 14 — Malaysia Airlines aims to reduce non-critical parts and components cost by 15 per cent via a Vendor Development Programme (VDP) under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development (MED).</p>
      <p>The VDP is also expected to lessen turnaround time and help boost operational efficiency, said group chief operations officer, Ahmad Luqman Mohd Azmi.</p>
      <p>“An additional benefit of sourcing locally is that Malaysia Airlines will be able to decrease its exposure to foreign exchange volatility,” he said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>VDP is a programme implemented by the government to boost the development of small and medium enterprises.</p>
      <p>The MoU was signed by Ahmad Luqman on behalf of Malaysia Airlines Group and MED secretary-general Datuk Wan Suraya Wan Mohd Radzi. </p>
      <p>“Malaysia Airlines is already an important economic enabler for the country. By signing the MoU with MED, we are also able to create a multiplier effect within the domestic economy by developing an eco-system for local vendors to support their businesses,” said Ahmad Luqman.</p>
      <p>He added that the VDP also helps to empower local companies by spurring their businesses in Malaysia’s airline industry, which is predominantly serviced by foreign companies.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, Malaysia Airlines will function as an anchor company and will implement the programme starting with its engineering, maintenance and AeroDarat services.</p>
      <p>The VDP will feature five pilot projects within Malaysia Airlines, mainly in sourcing additive manufacturing, carpets, seat upholstery, aircraft cleaning materials and chemicals. — Bernama</p>
