      <p>BEIRUT (AP) — Major roads around Lebanon have been reopened after a two-day closure triggered by a TV interview with President Michel Aoun in which he called on protesters to go home.</p>
      <p>The roads linking Beirut with the country’s south and north were opened shortly before noon Thursday, as well as others around the country.</p>
      <p>The opening of the roads came a day after protesters started building a wall inside a tunnel on the highway linking Beirut with north Lebanon leading to an outcry by the public who saw it as a reminder of the 1975-90 civil war.</p>
