      <h1>Foreigners invest $678m in debt instruments</h1>

      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Foreigners have continued to step up investment in Pakistan’s debt instruments, mostly in short-term treasury bills (T-bills), and have partly helped strengthen the country’s foreign exchange reserves to over $8 billion at the beginning of November.</p>
      <p>The return of stability to the rupee-dollar parity coupled with high rates of return on debt instruments encouraged foreigners to resume investment in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>They invested a net $678 million in the debt instruments in the past around five months – July-November 2019, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“The investment has partly helped strengthen the country’s foreign currency reserves (held by the SBP),” Arif Habib Limited Head of Research Samiullah Tariq said while talking to The Express Tribune.</p>
      <p>Foreign currency reserves, held by the central bank, surged $443 million to $8.35 billion in the week ended on November 1, 2019, the central bank reported last week.</p>

      <p>In the current month of November, the foreigners have so far invested a net $235 million. The investment is expected to give a further boost to the reserves later in the month and subsequently in the current fiscal year.</p>
      <p>“Foreigners are expected to invest a net $2 billion in T-bills in the current fiscal year,” Tariq anticipated.</p>
      <p>Breakdown of the investment suggested that foreigners had invested $675 million in three, six and 12-month T-bills, which offered a rate of return of up to 13.28%. They have invested another $3 million in three-year Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), which give a return of 11.8%.</p>
      <p>The central bank has also purchased dollars from currency dealers in a bid to shore up the foreign currency reserves, it has been learnt.</p>
      <p>Foreigners resumed investment in Pakistan’s debt instruments in July 2019 after a gap of 25 months. They invested nothing during the 25-month period from June 2017 to June 2019 as high volatility and uncertainty in the rupee-dollar parity discouraged them from making an investment.</p>
      <p>The central bank let the rupee depreciate 52% from December 2017 to Rs160.05 against the US dollar on June 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>The rupee has largely remained stable since then. Rather, it recovered 2.88% or Rs4.65 to Rs155.40 on Wednesday compared to Rs160.05 on June 30 and the stability has pushed the investors to pour investment into Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The benchmark interest rate, standing at an eight-year high of 13.25% at present, encouraged foreigners to renew their investment in the debt instruments in Pakistan because the interest rate was lower in their home countries, Tariq said.</p>
      <p>Most of the investment in the debt instruments came from two leading developed countries – the US and the UK. Most of the fund managers dealing with global investors are based in these two countries.</p>

      <p>Moreover, Islamabad formally entered into a 39-month International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme in July, when the lender released the first tranche of $991.4 million out of the total facility of $6 billion.</p>
      <p>“The IMF programme is another reason why foreign investors have staged a comeback,” Tariq said. “Foreigners feel comfortable investing in countries operating under the IMF programme.”</p>
      <p>Going forward, the SBP may keep the interest rate high to encourage investors to prolong their investment in Pakistan.</p>
