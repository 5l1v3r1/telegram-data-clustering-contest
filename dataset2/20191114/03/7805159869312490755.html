      <h1>Brave launches v1.0 of its privacy-centric, ad-blocking browser for PC and mobile</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:43:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Brave Software, the company behind the privacy-focused Brave browser, has now officially announced Brave 1.0 — its first stable release. The browser has been in the making for the last four years and it now offers all of its features on all platforms, including iOS. The open-source browser claims to revolutionize the way users interact with publishers and advertisers, while also offering a 3-6x faster and safer browsing experience.</p>
      <p>In a statement regarding the launch, Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave Software, said, “Today’s internet is broken, and users suffer the most. they are being tracked, tagged, and exploited; this not only violated privacy, but slows down page loads, drains batteries, and makes for a miserable experience. Meanwhile, publishers are losing revenue at a record pace due to a few gigantic super-companies and too many ad tech intermediaries. Advertisers are wasting time and money on an industry filled with fraud. Everyone with a legitimate stake in the open Web loses in this environment.”</p>
      <p>To combat this issue, Brave offers a variety of different features including a free built-in ad blocker, HTTPS Everywhere, script blocking, and third-party cookie blocking. It also boasts of features like a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/brave-browser-dark-theme-140/">native dark theme</a> for an improved browsing experience. While a number of other browsers also offer these features, Brave’s blockchain-based rewards system helps it stand out. The reward system helps users <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-brave-browser-supports-xda/">support their favorite publishers</a> (like XDA) and content creators with BAT (Basic Attention Tokens) — Brave’s own currency that can be earned by watching relevant ads. If you turn on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/brave-browser-brave-ads/">Brave Ads</a>, you’ll receive 70% of the gross ad revenue paid out in BAT and at the end of each month, you can donate your BAT to your favorite websites. According to the blog post, Brave Ads has already delivered nearly 475 privacy-preserving ad campaigns from brands like Intel, Pizza Hut, and more.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the browser includes a feature called Brave Shields that blocks invasive third-party ads, trackers, and auto-play videos without requiring any third-party programs. Thanks to this, the browser loads websites up to 6 times faster than other browsers and it even helps you save a significant amount of memory and battery life. The company claims that the browser saves an average of 27 seconds per page load against Chrome on macOS and 22 seconds per page against Firefox. It also states that the browser uses 58% less data than Chrome to load the same pages.</p>
      <p>Brave 1.0 is now available for download on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. The browser is available in 52 languages and you can download it on your Android device from the link below.</p>
