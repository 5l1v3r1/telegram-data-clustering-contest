      <p>“<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/short-man-rants-bagel-boss-tackled">Bagel Boss Guy</a>” Chris Morgan has been hospitalized after suffering an apparent stroke, his manager revealed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Morgan, 45, suffered the medical emergency on Monday outside of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">Long Island</a> deli where he parks the minivan that he lives in, said Bill Shannon.</p>

      <p>Shannon, who just learned of the health scare on Wednesday, said it appears Morgan lost feeling on the left side of his body.</p>

      <p>But when he visited his client at Southside Hospital in Bayshore, Shannon said Morgan communicated with him by moving his right arm.</p>
      <p>“I went in there and I said ‘hello’ to him,” Shannon said. “I said ‘I’m sorry this happened’ to him.”</p>
      <p>“He was definitely aware I was there and responded with his hand.”</p>
      <p>Morgan, though, wasn’t able to open his eyes or talk during the visit.</p>
      <p>Shannon was able to alert Morgan’s family, who showed up to the hospital late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The manager also said Morgan suffers from diabetes — though it’s unclear if that contributed to the medical episode.</p>

      <p>Morgan gained viral fame in July for getting roughed up while ranting about women inside a Long Island bagel shop.</p>
