      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 14): RHB Investment Bank Research has maintained its "neutral" rating on the banking sector after Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) announced a 50-basis-point cut in the statutory reserve requirement (SRR).</p>
      <p>In a note Nov 11, the research house said with the deceleration in 2019 loan growth (year-to-date September: +3.3% annualised) caused by the muted demand for credit, particularly from businesses, the additional monies should not result in any significant pick-up in loan growth.</p>
      <p>On Nov 8, BNM announced the reduction in the SRR ratio to 3.0% with effect from Nov 16.</p>
      <p>RHB Research said BNM reduced the SRR "to maintain sufficient liquidity in the domestic financial system and facilitate effective liquidity management by the banking institutions".</p>
      <p>It said that effectively, this means RM7.12 billion of additional funds are available for lending by banks.</p>
      <p>Should the entire amount be lent out, the research house's projected growth in system loans would just be a little stronger at 4.5% year-on-year (y-o-y), instead of 4.0% y-o-y, for 2019.</p>
      <p>In addition, system loans in 2018 expanded by 7.7% y-o-y. In its view, business sentiment must improve in order for a rebound in loan growth to happen.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, RHB Research believed the SRR cut will result in some improvement in asset yields.</p>
      <p>While it did not expect banks to turn more aggressive in their lending stance, it said they would likely deploy the additional funds for better returns.</p>
      <p>"Assuming the funds are placed in the interbank money market, at the current Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) of 3.3%, this would filter down to a very modest 0.7% uplift in our projected profit after tax and minority interest (PATAMI) for 2020," it said.</p>
      <p>Given the insignificant impact from the SRR cut, it made no changes to its earnings forecasts for banks.</p>
      <p>The research house anticipated sector core net profit to dip 0.9% y-o-y in 2019, before growing by a moderate 4.5% y-o-y in 2020.</p>
      <p>While most banks' loan-to-deposit ratios (LDRs) have risen to multi-year highs, it believed liquidity is not a concern.</p>
      <p>"In the current slow-growth environment, most banks have been actively managing liquidity and releasing excess funds to better manage net interest margins (NIMs) to support growth in net interest income," it said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the research house's top picks are Hong Leong Bank Bhd ("buy", target price [TP] RM18.70), BIMB Holdings Bhd ("buy", TP RM5) and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd ("buy", TP RM5.60).</p>
