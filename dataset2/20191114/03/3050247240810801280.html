      <h1>NEO Founder Explains Why the Internet Is Imperfect</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T03:19:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 03:19</time> by <a rel="author">Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr</a></address>
      <p>Kicking off the first panel of <a href="https://blockshow.com/asia-2019">BlockShow Asia 2019</a>, NEO founder Da Hongfei shared his views on the current state of decentralized web:</p>
      <blockquote>“The internet is a great invention. It looks almost perfect. But is it really?”</blockquote>
      <p>Citing examples like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the Equifax hack, he highlighted a critical isolation problem plaguing the Web, leading to monopoly, centralization, abuse, and single points of failure. </p>
      <p>He brought up other challenges, including vertical friction, the lack of internationally accepted Web standards, and the general immaturity of technology — these issues could postpone the coming fusion of the physical and biological world, which he called the “industrial revolution 4.0.” Increased competition can help. He also offered the following:</p>
      <blockquote>“These standards should be transparent and decentralized. Data ownership should be given back to the users.”</blockquote>
      <p>Da Hongfei cited Gartner, saying the blockchain industry will generate $3.1 trillion of value by 2030 that is equivalent to the combined market cap of FAANG. So what should the future of the internet be?</p>
      <blockquote>“In the future, I believe today’s applications will become legacy applications. New blockchain applications will go from marginal, to alternative, and eventually to mainstream.”</blockquote>
