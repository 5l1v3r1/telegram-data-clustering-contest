      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Jennifer Nettles is not mincing words.</p>
      <p>At the 2019 CMA Awards on Wednesday evening, the "Sugarland" singer donned a white pantsuit and pink train demanding equal airplay for female artists and equal pay. Her ensemble featured the phrase "Equal pay" on the back of her jacket along with an illustration of a woman and a Venus symbol on the train.</p>
      <p>When she turned around to open the train, Nettles revealed the phrases "Play our [expletive] records" and "Please and thank you" written on the inside of the train.</p>
      <p>"I said please and thank you!" she quipped to the press on the red carpet.</p>
