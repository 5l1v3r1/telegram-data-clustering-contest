      <p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was absent for courtroom arguments in two cases on Wednesday, as she is reported to have fallen ill with the flu.</p>
      <p>It is not the first time Ginsburg has triggered concerns about her health, as she has long been diagnosed with lung cancer and a tumor on her pancreas in 1999 and 2009, respectively.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, has been serving as Supreme Court Justice since 1999, the second woman confirmed to the high court. In July, she <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907251076353062-justice-ginsburg-alive-unlike-senator-promised-death/">slammed the rumours about her health issues</a>, noting that the senator who had ''predicted'' Ginsburg would not survive cancer had died himself.</p>
