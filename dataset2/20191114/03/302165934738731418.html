      <p>TOKYO, Nov 14 — Asian stocks fell today after soft Chinese economic data showed the trade war between Beijing and Washington hitting growth in the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
      <p>MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan , which had drifted in to positive territory in morning trade, turned negative to trade 0.4 per cent lower.</p>
      <p>Japan’s Nikkei stock index dropped 0.6 per cent, while Shanghai blue chips turned from positive to flat and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX200 index wiped some of its gains to trade less than 0.5 per cent higher by mid afternoon in Sydney.</p>
      <p>China’s industrial production growth slowed sharply in October, rising 4.7 per cent year-on-year, official data showed, missing forecasts of 5.4 per cent, while retail sales also slowed to fall short of expectations and investment growth hit a record low.</p>
      <p>“The weakness in investment and production would suggest that confidence is down and trade is probably a big factor within that,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney.</p>
      <p>“What it does do is it puts more pressure on Chinese authorities to come to a deal with (US President) Donald Trump on trade, just as Prseident Trump’s desire to be re-elected puts pressure on him to come to a deal with the Chinese,” Oliver said.</p>
      <p>However, the weak figures also landed as the latest round of markets optimism for such a resolution has begun to run dry.</p>
      <p>Trump offered no update on the progress of negotiations in a policy speech on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that talks had snagged on farm purchases.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the global fallout from the dispute is widening.</p>
      <p>Japan’s economic growth hit its slowest pace in a year in the third quarter as soft demand knocked exports.</p>
      <p>“Looking around the region, you’ve had some near misses of recession — Korea’s been one, Singapore’s also been one and you’ve got Hong Kong in a recession at the moment,” said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jeffries in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“So it’s not great. It’s not a cycle that is not leaving any scars,” he said.</p>
      <p>Worries about spiralling violence as anti-government protests intensify in Hong Kong have also soured investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>Protesters paralysed parts of Hong Kong for a fourth day today, forcing school closures and blocking highways and other transport links in a marked escalation of unrest in the financial hub.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell almost another percentage point today to a fresh one-month low. Safe havens such as the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and gold held on to gains.</p>
      <p>US stock futures fell 0.1 per cent in Asia today after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.07 per cent gain yesterday and closed at a record high, helped by a surge in Walt Disney Co shares.</p>
      <p>US stocks have climbed to record levels recently, fuelled by interest rate cuts, positive earnings, and signs the economy is bottoming out, but doubts about progress in trade talks remain a huge risk to financial markets and global growth.</p>
      <p>A new Reuters poll showed most economists do not expect Washington and Beijing to reach a permanent trade truce over the coming year.</p>
      <p>In currency markets, the yen was quoted at 108.73 per dollar, close to a one-week high. The Swiss franc traded at 0.9901 versus the greenback, near the highest in more than a week.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar skidded to a one-month low today after a worryingly weak reading on employment re-ignited speculation about another cut in interest rates.</p>
      <p>US crude rose 0.4 per cent to US$57.32 (RM238.37) a barrel after a fall in stockpiles added to positive comments by the US Federal Reserve head on the US economy.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell slightly to 1.8774 per cent. — Reuters</p>
