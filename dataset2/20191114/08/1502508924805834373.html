      <p>Supreme Court on Thursday said that restrictions on women in religious places was not limited to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sabarimala">Sabarimala </a>alone and was prevalent in other religions as well.<br/><br/>The court referred all review pleas to a larger seven-judge bench seeking review of its 2018 ruling that allowed menstruating women to enter the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sabarimala">Sabarimala </a>temple in Kerala.</p>
      <p>A five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi gave its judgment this morning after hearing as many as 65 petitions - including 56 review petitions and four fresh writ petitions and five transfer pleas - which were filed after its <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sabarimala">Sabarimala </a>verdict sparked violent protests in Kerala.</p>
      <p>On September 28, 2018, the top court opened the gates of the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala dedicated to Lord Ayyappa to the women in the age group of 10-50, saying it was violative of their fundamental rights and constitutional guarantees.<br/><br/>The courtâ€™s verdict sparked protests across Kerala, mainly led by caste outfits like the NSS and right-wing Hindu organisations of the Sangh Parivar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, this year, the temple is being opened for the two-month-long annual pilgrimage on November 16 and the verdict has come just two days before it.</p>
