      <h1>Payback order for Craigneuk man caught in car park with knife and heroin</h1>
      <h2>Police officers on patrol spotted 22-year-old Hamilton near flats</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Wishaw Press, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/wishaw-press/</a></address>
      <p>A Craigneuk man who was caught with a knife and heroin in a Wishaw street has avoided a prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Connor Hamilton was instead ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid community work and attend substance misuse counselling.</p>
      <p>He was also given a one-year supervision order when he appeared in the dock at Hamilton Sheriff Court last week.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, 22, of Laurel Drive, admitted unlawful possession of a blade and heroin in Birkshaw Brae, Gowkthrapple, on March 25.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scott King, prosecuting, said police officers were on patrol in the afternoon when they saw Hamilton in a car park near flats.</p>
      <p>Mr King told the court: “On seeing the police, the accused placed his hands in his tracksuit bottoms, put his head down and walked away quickly.</p>
      <p>“The officers were suspicious and detained him for a drugs search.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He was asked if he had anything that could harm the officers and produced a lockback knife with an eight-inch blade.</p>
      <p>“He also had a bag which contained £10 worth of heroin in a pocket of his fleece jacket.”</p>
      <p>After studying a criminal justice social work report, Sheriff Shiona Waldron said she was prepared to impose a community order as an alternative to a prison sentence.</p>
      <p>The community work order was cut from 300 hours to 200 because of Hamilton’s earlier guilty plea to the charges.</p>
