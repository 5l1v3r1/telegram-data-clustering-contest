      <h1>Jordan Henderson opens up on why he was "ready to kill" Luis Suarez at Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Henderson arrived at Anfield in a stunning £20million move from boyhood club Sunderland ahead of the 2011/12 campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:24:47+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Jordan Henderson has revealed how he was "ready to kill" Luis Suarez during his early years at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> - after the striker regularly belittled him in training.</p>
      <p>Henderson arrived at Anfield in a stunning £20million move from boyhood club Sunderland ahead of the 2011/12 campaign.</p>
      <p>By that point, Suarez had already been with the Reds for six months, having joined from Ajax in January 2011, and was well on his way to becoming the focal point of Kenny Dalglish's side.</p>
      <p>Now Henderson, who was only 20 at the time and had just one England cap under his belt, has opened up on his bust-up with Suarez, who would gesticulate angrily towards the midfielder in training.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher on <a href="https://audioboom.com/channels/5005036">The Greatest Game with Jamie Carragher</a> podcast, he said: "I was trying to do the best I can do. Being a footballer, there is criticism and people doubting you all the time.</p>
      <p>"At that time, I was a young player and there were one or two things Luis did in training that I didn't like.</p>
      <p>"It made me feel I wasn't good enough to be in the same team in training.</p>
      <p>"The arms were up like 'what the f***, what is he doing', like I shouldn't be there.</p>

      <p>"That really hurt me. He did it three times and then I exploded and I was ready to kill him.</p>
      <p>"From that point, I had a good relationship with Luis. The next game I set him up for his goal.</p>
      <p>"He was brilliant with me after that and I was really close to him after that and he was another big player I learned from."</p>

      <p>Henderson, meanwhile, has deservedly earned cult hero status at Anfield and replaced the legendary Steven Gerrard as Reds captain.</p>
      <p>He helped Jurgen Klopp's side romp to a Champions League triumph last season and, this season, they are on track to secure their first league title since 1990.</p>
