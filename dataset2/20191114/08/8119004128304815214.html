        <b>Bangladesh have been forced on the back foot early in the innings after losing both their openers in quick succession in the of the two Test matches against India in Indore.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Tigers lost their first wicket with 12 runs on the board as left-hander Imrul Kayes (6) edged an Umesh Yadav outswinger to Ajinkya Rahane at first slip.</p>
      <p>Shadman Islam (6) followed him back to the pavilion in the very next over after he nicked an Ishant Sharma delivery to Wriddhiman Saha behind the stumps.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh are currently 19 for 2 as skipper Mominul Haque and Mohammad Mithun attempt to steady the ship.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Tigers won the toss and opted to bat first on a wicket with enough grass on it to cause problems for batsmen.</p>
