      <h1>Manchester City 'launch formal complaint' against referee in Liverpool loss</h1>
      <h2>The Etihad club are angered by decisions made by Michael Oliver and reported his performance to PGMOL.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:21:17+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>An official complaint has been made by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> over the performance of Michael Oliver in their defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pep-guardiola">Pep Guardiola's</a> men were beaten 3-1 on Merseyside to leave them nine points off the pace in the race to win the title.</p>
      <p>The City boss even sarcastically thanked Oliver and his assistants by wildly shaking his hand and making a big deal of saying: "Thank you so much".</p>
      <p>And now, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10340846/man-city-complaint-michael-oliver-liverpool-defeat-var-mike-riley/">the Sun,</a> the club have reported the referee to his bosses, insisting he poorly officiated the game.</p>
      <p>Guardiola was also seen remonstrating with the officials on the sideline when they didn't award two penalties to City.</p>
      <p>The first came in the first half when Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared to handle in the box but VAR dismissed it and Liverpool scored through Fabinho seconds later.</p>

      <p>A second came when Raheem Sterling appeared to play the ball off the hand of the Liverpool right back in the second half and City lodged an official complaint to PGMOL chief Mike Riley within 24 hours of the game.</p>
      <p>The fiery clash at Anfield has led to Sterling being dropped by England for their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifier with Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The winger clashed with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Joe Gomez during the game and despite making up at full time, the pair were involved in a bust-up when they met at St George's Park for England training on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate decided to punish Sterling by leaving him out of the game on Thursday night, with the City winger understood to be the agressor.</p>
