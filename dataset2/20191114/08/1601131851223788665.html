      <h1>T-Mobile rolling out Galaxy S9 and S9+ November security update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:56:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/devices/galaxy-s9/">Galaxy S9</a> and Galaxy S9+ received the November 2019 security update on the unlocked Exynos-powered models earlier this month, and North American carrier T-Mobile is now pushing out the update to the two phones as well. The update comes with software version <b>G960USQS7CSJ6</b> and <b>G965USQS7CSJ6</b> for the S9 and S9+ respectively, and its changelog only <a href="https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-37152">includes the new security patch</a>.</p>
      <h3>No new features included in the update</h3>
      <p>The November 2019 security patch for Galaxy devices <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-monthly-updates-november-2019-security-patch-detailed/">includes a fix for a critical bug</a> in the Android OS that was discovered in September. The Galaxy S9 was one of three Galaxy devices <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/october-security-patch-fixes-vulnerability-affecting-a-few-samsung-phones/">mentioned by name in the list of affected devices</a>, so it’s only natural that Samsung would want to release the November update for 2018 Galaxy S flagship in every country as soon as possible. Hopefully, carriers in the US will show similar urgency and soon follow T-Mobile and release the update for their Galaxy S9 and S9+ variants.</p>
      <p>To grab the latest update over the air, you have to follow the same drill: Open the Settings app, tap <i>Software update</i>, then select the <i>Download and install </i>option. As always, an alternative method for updating to the latest software is to download the relevant firmware from our <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares">firmware database</a> and use a Windows PC to install it on your S9 or S9+.</p>
