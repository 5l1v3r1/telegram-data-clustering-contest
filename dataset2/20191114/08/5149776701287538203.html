      <h1>'A step up' - Scotland international putting himself in shop window again after failed Forest summer move</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham Forest transfer news | The Reds were one of a number of clubs interested in Aberdeen's Scott McKenna in the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:50:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna says he will “see what happens come January”, following a failed move to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Reds were among a number of sides who <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/angry-aberdeen-boss-hits-out-3187121">tried to prise away the Scot</a> during the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Forest and Championship rivals QPR put forward offers believed to be in the region of £3m, while Aston Villa were said to have had a bid in the region of £6.5m rejected.</p>
      <p>Celtic, Hull City, Stoke City and Swansea City have also previously been linked with the 23-year-old, who is reportedly valued at somewhere between £6m and £10m by his club.</p>
      <p>McKenna handed in a transfer request on deadline day, but after a switch south of the border failed to materialise he is keen to put himself in the shop window again approaching the January window.</p>
      <p>“International football is a step up from the SPFL,” McKenna told <a href="https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/18034890.scott-mckenna-prove-january-suitors-can-cut-higher-level/">the Evening Times,</a> having linked up with the Scotland squad this week.</p>
      <p>“Teams will look at that and see if I can handle it. That’s always what I’m trying to prove to them.</p>

      <p>“I just need to keep my head down and see what happens come January.”</p>
      <p>“The summer was <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/disappointment-defender-scott-mckenna-after-3199870">probably the worst</a> for me,” he added.</p>
      <p>“There was maybe a bit of expectancy for it (a move) to happen.</p>
      <p>“When you have been working for the full year, building up to that point that you thought was going to be THE time, there was that wee bit of disappointment. But it can’t linger for too long.</p>
      <p>“The window closed. We were in Croatia and we had a game an hour or two later. There was no time for me to dwell on things.</p>
      <p>“As frustrating as it can be, there is absolutely nothing I can do about it, apart from trying to play well.”</p>
      <p>McKenna, who is under contract with the Scottish side until 2023, has made 16 appearances for the Dons so far this season.</p>
      <p>Forest went on <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-confirm-deadline-day-3190467">to sign Spanish defender Chema</a> on deadline day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-alexander-milosevic-lamouchi-3488368">Fellow centre-back Alexander Milosevic</a> has since left the City Ground, but the Reds still have Joe Worrall, Michael Dawson, Tobias Figueiredo and injured duo Yohan Benalouane and Michael Hefele, as well as Chema, as defensive options on their books.</p>
