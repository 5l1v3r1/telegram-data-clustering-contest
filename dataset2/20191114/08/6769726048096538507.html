      <p>MERTOME aged care and retirement village residents have improved their health and well-being thanks to a new sensory garden.</p>
      <p>The Bayswater village, run by aged care providers <a href="https://hallprior.com.au/nursing-homes/western-australia/bayswater/mertome/">Hall &amp; Prior</a>, recently installed the garden around a central courtyard and launched a Memory Support Unit.</p>
      <p>The garden features the five senses; sight, sound, touch, taste and smell.</p>
      <p>It also has raised garden beds which are accessible for residents in wheelchairs or with limited mobility.</p>
      <p>Landscape supervisor Josh Petrusma said the garden had plants and flowers with colour and texture as well as wind chimes and a misting kit to make extra noise.</p>
      <p>Senior occupational therapist Madelyne Glover said outdoor areas were calming places for residents to spend their time.</p>
      <p>“This new outdoor space will make a significant impact on our residents’ independence, health and well-being,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Many people living at Mertome would have had their own garden previously, so being outdoors in a familiar space provides both memory prompts and sensory stimulation.”</p>
