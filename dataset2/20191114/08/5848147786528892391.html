      <h1>Spotlight on foreign interference at universities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:37:50+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/finbar-mallon/" target="_blank">Finbar O'Mallon</a></address>
      <p>Australian universities will have to name their research partners and financial donors under new rules to safeguard against foreign interference.</p>
      <p>The federal government directive follows concerns about China’s influence in Australia and a <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2019/06/04/anu-data-breach/">2018 cyber attack on the Australian National University</a>, which was only revealed in June.</p>
      <p>Political ties of research collaborators, the end goal of the research and the objectives of foreign governments will all be scrutinised under the changes.</p>
      <p>The new rules were drawn up by universities and intelligence experts from the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.</p>
      <p>Under the new guidelines, universities will have to consider the “dual-use” of their research.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, University of Queensland researchers were found to be collaborating on facial recognition technology used by the Chinese government to surveil ethnic Uighurs.</p>
      <p>The paper detailing the new guidelines does not list any penalties for universities found to be breaching the new rules.</p>
      <p>Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan said he was confident in the new guidelines, which he said would ensure universities understood the risks they faced.</p>
