      <p>Well damn, you may as well throw your <a href="https://jalopnik.com/tag/mclaren-senna">McLaren Senna</a> right in the trash heap because the British supercar maker just bested itself again. The new 2020 McLaren Elva is lighter, faster with an 804 horsepower twin-turbo V8, and audacious in its lack of a windshield and windows.</p>

      <p>That 804 HP power coupled with the lightest carbon body McLaren has ever designed gets the Elva from 0 to 62 mph in under 3 seconds, and from 0 to 200km/h quicker than the Senna in just 6.7 seconds. The Elva also has the benefit of looking considerably better than the Senna.</p>

      <p>The Elva name comes from 1960s McLaren-Elva sports cars for the street designed by Bruce McLaren and derived from Group 7 race cars, which is the <a href="http://media.mclarenautomotive.com/en-us/releases/759#gallery">company’s excuse</a> to make a terrifyingly quick modern supercar with no windshield.</p>

      <p>McLaren claims the Elva has been homologated for every market, and because of that the car is also available with a fixed windshield. You know, for those of us that don’t enjoy turning road insects into tiny bullets to be collected by our face while driving.</p>

      <p>But McLaren also claims that won’t be a problem if you go for no windshield, as the Elva has been designed with a so-called “McLaren Active Air Management System” that deflects air away from just directly pummelling the vehicle occupants creating a “bubble of calm.”</p>

      <p>There will only be 399 Elvas built, with or without windshields, starting at $US1,690,000 ($2,473,623) before you make any personalised touches. Yet again a fancy car company is charging more for less, technically. They love doing that.</p>
      <p>Find a good helmet with a visor, too, even if McLaren claims you don’t need it.</p>
