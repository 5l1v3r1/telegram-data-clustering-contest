      <p>World stocks nudged down on Thursday as Chinese economic data slowed in October and Germany only narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter, adding to worries about the global growth fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
      <p>LONDON: World stocks nudged down on Thursday as Chinese economic data slowed in October and Germany only narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter, adding to worries about the global growth fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.</p>
      <p>MSCI'S All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.14per cent after the start of trading in Europe.</p>

      <p>European shares fell after data showing the German economy grew just 0.1per cent in the third quarter, avoiding edging into a mild contraction thanks to consumer spending but remaining weak nevertheless.</p>
      <p>The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat by midday in London, while Germany's DAX was down 0.2per cent.</p>
      <p>"Obviously it's better than expected, but actually I would argue is that it's a hollow victory because in effect it makes a fiscal response less likely," said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London, referring to the German data.</p>
      <p>"I think if they'd gone into a technical recession, the pressure to loosen the purse strings, so to speak, would have been much much greater."</p>
      <p>Ten-year bond yields across the euro area fell around 2 basis points each. Germany, French and Dutch yields reached one-week lows,.</p>
      <p>U.S. stock futures were down 0.1per cent, pointing to a weaker opening on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>In Asia, stocks fell after soft economic data in China and Japan showed the trade war between Beijing and Washington was hitting growth in some of the world's biggest economies.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3per cent. Japan's Nikkei stock index fell further, dropping 0.8per cent.</p>
      <p>Shanghai blue chips were up 0.15per cent, however, supported by expectations that the gloomy figures would add to the case for stimulus.</p>
      <p>China's factory output growth slowed significantly more than expected in October, as weakness in global and domestic demand and the drawn-out Sino-U.S. trade war weighed on broad segments of the world's second-largest economy.</p>
      <p>Fixed asset investment, a key driver of economic growth, rose just 5.2per cent from January to October, against expected growth of 5.4per cent and the weakest pace since Reuters' records began in 1996.</p>
      <p>China and the United States are holding in-depth discussions on a "phase one" trade agreement, and cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reach such a deal, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>China's industrial production growth slowed sharply in October, with the 4.7per cent year-on-year rise well below forecasts for 5.4per cent. Investment growth hit a record low and retail sales also missed expectations.</p>
      <p>The weak figures also come as market confidence about a resolution being reached weakens, with a new Reuters poll showing most economists do not expect Washington and Beijing to strike a permanent truce over the coming year.</p>
      <p>Trump offered no update on the progress of negotiations in a policy speech on Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that talks had snagged on farm purchases.</p>
      <p>U.S. futures were down 0.14per cent, following a record-high close on the S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Worries about spiraling violence as anti-government protests intensify in Hong Kong have also soured investor sentiment.</p>
      <p>Protesters paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for a fourth day, forcing school closures and blocking highways and other transport links in a marked escalation of unrest in the financial hub.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8per cent to a fresh one-month low.</p>
      <p>RISK-OFF 'ALIVE AND WELL'</p>
      <p>In currency markets, safe havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc gained.</p>
      <p>The yen was quoted at 108.67 per dollar, close to a one-week high. The Swiss franc traded at 0.9889 versus the greenback, also near its highest in more than a week.</p>
      <p>"Increasing signs of unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America coupled with the uncertainty around the trade talks is keeping the risk-off sentiment well and alive in FX markets," said Lee Hardman, a London-based currency strategist at MUFG.</p>
      <p>The dollar was flat against a basket of peers.</p>
      <p>The Australian dollar skidded to a one-month low after a worryingly weak reading on employment re-ignited speculation about another cut in interest rates.</p>
      <p>Oil rose after industry data showed a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories, while comments from an OPEC official about lower-than-expected U.S. shale production growth in 2020 also provided some support.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures rose 1.27per cent to US$63.16 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 1.09per cent to US$57.74 per barrel.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.8428per cent, compared with its U.S. close of 1.869per cent on Wednesday.</p>
