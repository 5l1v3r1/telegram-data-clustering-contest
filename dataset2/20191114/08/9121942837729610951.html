      <p>TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — An Estonian court has given a one-year suspended sentence to veteran ski coach Mati Alaver for his role in international doping.</p>
      <p>The Baltic News Service reports that Alaver was found to have incited athletes to dope and accepted a plea bargain.</p>
      <p>Estonia’s public broadcaster reports the court identified three Estonian athletes and one foreign athlete involved but ruled their names would not be disclosed.</p>
      <p>Alaver’s case is linked to the arrests of five cross-country skiers, two of them Estonians, at the Nordic world championships in Austria in February.</p>
      <p>The case has caused a scandal in Estonia, where cross-country skiers are star athletes who have won all of the small Baltic nation’s seven Winter Olympic medals.</p>
      <p>Alaver was stripped of two state honors by President Kersti Kaljulaid in March.</p>
