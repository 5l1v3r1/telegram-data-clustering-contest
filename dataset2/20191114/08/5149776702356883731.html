      <h1>Mum's angry Amazon rant after delivery 'ruins Christmas' for daughter, six</h1>
      <h2>She was not happy with the company</h2>

        <b>As Christmas arrives, you might be considering buying products from Amazon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Well, one mum has issued a long rant about the company after things didn't quite go to plan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/amazon-christmas-delivery-barbie-mum-3533021">HullLive reporter Joanna Lovell </a>has revealed <b>why her daughter was very confused after the delivery came:</b></b>
      </p>
      <p>I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and actually probably couldn't live without the next-day delivery service.</p>
      <p>I've got Amazon Prime and this month alone I've ordered everything from carpets and door hinges to football socks and a USB card reader from the retail giant.</p>
      <p>I've never had a problem with delivery before, items are always well packaged - if anything they're over-packaged with massive boxes for the smallest of items.</p>
      <p>But I was left in a difficult position with my daughter Jasmine yesterday after a bright pink and white large Barbie Ambulance - which was meant to be a Christmas present for her - was delivered to our house without any packaging what-so-ever.</p>
      <p>When we got home there it was on the doorstep for all to see - and my daughter's eyes nearly popped out of her head with excitement when she saw it.</p>
      <p>I'd had no chance to hide it because although I'd had an alert on the app to say it had been delivered, I never for one moment expected it to arrive as it is, with just an address label stuck to the side!</p>

        <figcaption>The address label was stuck onto the toy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>'There was no warning'</h3>
      <p>Amazon have today said its website states the item arrives in packaging "which reveals what's inside".</p>
      <p>However, if you order the item using your phone - either via the website or via the Amazon app - this message is not displayed at the point of purchase.</p>
      <p>I used my phone and at no point throughout the transaction was this message displayed.</p>
      <p>Having spoken with Amazon today I've gone back online to re-order it to check if I missed it and I hadn't.</p>
      <p>When using your phone to order, if you click 'buy now' you will not see the message, as my phone screenshot below shows.</p>
      <p>To see the message on your phone you would have to scroll right down, past the 'Add to basket' and 'Buy Now' buttons - which I had absolutely no need to do.</p>
      <p>It is only if you are using the website on a desktop computer that the message about packaging is displayed on the same screen under the 'Buy it Now' button - but even then it can easily be missed because it does not stand out at all.</p>

        <figcaption>There was no mention of the item not being packaged at the point of purchase on a phone</figcaption>

      <h3>'Jasmine's excitement turned to confusion'</h3>
      <p>So Jasmine's excitement soon turned to a puzzled look when she began asking my why a toy she had put on her letter to Father Christmas just days before, had arrived at our house out of the blue.</p>
      <p>She reminded me we haven't even posted her letter to Santa yet, so how could he possibly know she wanted it and why had it arrived early? So. Many. Questions.</p>
      <p>Being totally caught on the hop I ended up saying it must be a mistake and had no idea how it got there, so you can only imagine her disapointment.</p>
      <p>I could have just said I ordered it for her as a surprise for being so well behaved recently - but A) she's a being a bit of a diva at the moment and B) it cost me £39.99 - and my mid-year treats don't usually cost me that much!</p>
      <p>Plus I'd have to do the same for my son, so I'd be £80 down through no fault of my own.</p>

        <figcaption>The Barbie van was left on Joanna's doorstep without packaging</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now I'm left with the dilemma over whether to give it to her or not. If she opens it on Christmas Day, the magic of Christmas will be ruined, because she will remember seeing it.</p>
      <p>But she will be disappointed if she doesn't get it. It's top of her list as she loves playing with it at her cousin's house.</p>
      <p>So thanks a bunch Amazon. As a parent you do the best to keep the magic of Christmas alive for as long as you can - then Amazon come along and clumsily ruin it.</p>
      <p>You don't have to be a genius to work out that items like this, ordered in mid November, are probably a Christmas gift, so why there's an option for it to arrive without packaging seems pointless to me.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but I could hardly give it to her with a giant label on the side with my address on it! It's meant to come on Santa's sleigh!</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, my issue is not the fact the product was left on my doorstep - I do have a 'safe place' arrangement with Amazon - my problem is the fact they're sending out obvious Christmas presents without any disguise!</p>
      <p>So, parents, if you're planning on ordering any Christmas presents from Amazon this Christmas I'd make sure you scour the listing to check for any information about packaging, or make sure your children' won't be home when the item is delivered!</p>
      <p>Amazon, I urge you to re-think your packaging policies, or you are going to ruin Christmas for a lot of children this year.</p>

        <figcaption>The label will not come off the box</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Any notices about packaging should be on the listing itself, and repeated again on the purchasing pages.</p>
      <p>In fact you should not be able to buy the product until you have acknowledged you have read the message about packaging. The message should be visible for those using a phone to order - displayed <i>before</i> the 'Buy it Now' button.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, parents everywhere.</p>
      <h4>What Amazon say</h4>
      <p>A spokesperson for Amazon said: "Before adding the item to the basket, the website advises: 'Item arrives in packaging that reveals what's inside. To hide it, choose Ship in Amazon packaging at checkout.</p>
      <p>"We offer customers the option to conceal their product at no cost by selecting 'Ship in Amazon Packaging' at the checkout.</p>
      <p>"Amazon continually works on behalf of customers to reduce and minimise the amount of packaging materials we use under our Frustration-Free Packaging Programme.</p>
      <p>"As part of the programme we have worked with manufacturers around the world to design their products to ship in their own packaging without the need for additional packaging."</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said he would "feedback" to the team the information about this message not displaying for those using a phone to order, unless you scroll past the 'Buy it Now' button.</p>
