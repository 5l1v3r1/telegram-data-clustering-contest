      <h1>Crypto.com Grows Offerings With New Exchange and Fundraising Platform</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:32:14+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author">Danny Nelson</a></address>
      <p>Crypto.com announced the launch of a new exchange Thursday, in an expansion of the Hong Kong-based firm’s list of crypto services.</p>
      <p>The exchange opens up to beta testers Nov. 18 and to the wider public in December, according to a press release. The three-year-old company has also unveiled a fundraising platform for crypto startups.</p>
      <p>Previously known for issuing custodial wallets and crypto-backed debit cards, the new exchange bolsters CEO and co-founder Kris Marszalek’s vision of creating full services experiences for his one million wallet holders. Marszalek said the launch is tactical – necessary for Crypto.com’s future.</p>
      <p>“In the next bull run, the companies that will surely thrive are those that manage to build an entire ecosystem,” he said. “It’s very hard for a company that offers only one type of product to compete with companies with much broader distribution that cover each of the use cases.”</p>
      <p>At launch, the exchange will offer three trading pairs, matching CRO – the Crypto.com token – tether (USDT) and bitcoin (BTC) against BTC, ether (ETH), stellar (XLM), XRP, EOS, litecoin (LTC), MCO, CRO and USDT. The company expects to add more assets over time.</p>
      <p>It also plans to expand user access points. While the exchange is available via desktop exclusively at launch, Marszalek said mobile users – already accessing Crypto.com’s other services via a consolidated app – will get app access in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Also launched Thursday is a blockchain fundraising platform called The Syndicate that gives project builders an avenue to raise capital while keeping equity, Marszalek said. Digital asset issuers provide a certain number of their tokens to Crypto.com for a discounted pre-sale open to holders of the exchange’s native coin, CRO.</p>
      <p>“It’s a win win,” Marszalek said. “We pass on all the proceeds from such a token sale back to the project so they have a little bit of capital from this exercise.”</p>
      <p>The exchange will add margin trading in 2020 too. Marszalek said other expansions may bring a crypto collateralized “credit card/debit card hybrid” to market as well.</p>
      <p>Each works into Marszalek’s wider goal: build a Crypto.com ecosystem so comprehensive, so “sticky,” that new users sign up – and the old ones stay around.</p>
      <p>“We think we’ve nailed the customer acquisition piece and the stickiness of the product before we actually launched the exchange,” Marszalek. “This is the absolute key element.”</p>
