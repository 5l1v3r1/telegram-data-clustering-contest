      <p>The transformation of one of Newcastle’s most historic buildings into a Hard Rock Café is all set to go ahead.</p>
      <p>Plans were unveiled earlier this year for the iconic restaurant chain to open its first site in the North East at the Grade-I listed Guildhall on the Quayside.</p>
      <p>Those plans have now secured the final backing of city council bosses, who granted planning permission for the £2.5m renovation on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>David Tilly, who is <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/hard-rock-cafe-newcastle-marks-16709688">behind the bid to bring the Hard Rock Café to Tyneside with wife Penny</a>, said: “It’s amazing, we are absolutely over the moon. Now we just can’t wait to get started and get this Hard Rock Café open.</p>

      <p>“We are just about ready to go. We will be on site before the end of the year to do some stripping out work and then will look at doing the refit in the new year.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have a final date set for an opening yet, but it will be spring 2020.”</p>
      <p>Mr and Mrs Tilly have said that the rock and roll-themed eatery will pay homage to local music legends such as Sting, Brian Johnson, and Mark Knopfler.</p>
      <p>Newcastle City Council <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/big-step-forward-bid-bring-16974796">also granted an alcohol licence for the internationally-recognised brand</a> to open on the ground floor of the Guildhall in September.</p>
      <p>Issues have been raised about fire safety measures at the centuries-old building.</p>
      <p>Sir Len Fenwick, chairman of the Freemen of Newcastle, told council bosses at a meeting on Wednesday that the group had concerns over the historic site.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Tilly says that fire alarm systems are being upgraded across the building and that “everything is going to be improved”.</p>
      <p>A council spokesperson added: “We are aware of some fire safety concerns in relation to the Hard Rock Café occupying the ground floor of the Guildhall.</p>
      <p>“Our Building Control Team have been appointed by Hard Rock Café to inspect their alterations to the building to ensure all meet the relevant building regulations. It will only be approved when they do.”</p>
      <p>The Guildhall formed the ancient centre of municipal government of Newcastle and the earliest signs of a guildhall on the site date back to the 13th century, before being rebuilt in the 17th century.</p>
      <p>The first Hard Rock Café was opened in London near Hyde Park in 1971 and the chain now has venues in 74 countries.</p>
