      <p><b>CAIRO: </b>Six people were killed and 15 injured when a leaking oil pipeline caught fire in Egypt’s northern province of Bahira on Wednesday, officials said.</p>
      <p>The head of Egypt’s oil pipelines authority, Abdelmoneim Hafez, said the leak was the work of “thieves” syphoning off oil.</p>
      <p>The fire broke out on the pipeline near Itay al-Baroud, a village half-way between Cairo and Alexandria, health ministry spokesperson Khaled Mugahed said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The wounded were taken to a nearby hospital, while the blaze was put out and the leak fixed.</p>
