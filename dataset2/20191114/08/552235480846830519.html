      <h1>Ayrshire school hosts party for boy who spent three years battling cancer</h1>
      <h2>Oscar Hamilton's mum says her family went through "absolute hell" during his treatment.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Dunn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>After three arduous years, which included defeating sepsis three times and pneumonia once, a schoolboy’s battle against cancer is over.</p>
      <p>Courageous Oscar Hamilton was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia on the eve of his fourth birthday.</p>
      <p>The seven-year-old’s mum, Claire, said that the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmaurs</a> family endured three years of “absolute hell” throughout his life-saving treatment.</p>
      <p>And last week, Oscar’s school – Kilmaurs Primary – hosted a party for him and his family, including dad Scott and sister Ruby, to mark the end of his chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>Recalling the moment she was told her son had cancer, 27-year-old Claire told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock Standard</a>: “I asked doctors if my son was going to die.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I told them that I just couldn’t lose him.</p>
      <p>“I had three miscarriages before and I just could not bear to lose him.</p>
      <p>“Myself and Scott were taken out of the room where we were with Oscar and we were taken to another place.</p>
      <p>“The doctor took a deep breath and he said that the urine test showed that it was 98 per cent likely to be leukaemia.</p>

      <p>“Scott screamed. It was like something from a horror film. He fell to his knees and he was punching the floor.</p>
      <p>“Even the doctors were crying but I told them that I needed them to hold it together for us.”</p>
      <p>The diagnosis of Oscar’s leukaemia had been a drawn-out process that was discovered after a shoulder injury sustained at football training.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Oscar endured a sore stomach and legs and in the following days <br/>was incredibly lethargic and withdrawn.</p>
      <p>This all culminated in him waking up screaming one night because the pain was so severe. All of the tests at the hospital looked normal.</p>
      <p>But following the urine test results, Oscar and his family were transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.</p>

      <p>Nurses helped decorate Oscar’s room for his birthday the following day and his parents were allowed to choose a present from a store at the hospital.</p>
      <p>“When we were at Glasgow we were told that on the Friday when Oscar had the urine test that he had half of a cell that contained leukaemia,” Claire added.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“In a matter of days that had multiplied to more than 15,000 cells.</p>
      <p>“When I heard that I thought it was game over for him.</p>
      <p>“But the consultant had said that that type of leukaemia has a very good success rate and that we had caught it quite early.”</p>
      <p>Oscar then spent three-and-a-half weeks in hospital and was allowed home to recover after responding well to treatment.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, he was in remission after five weeks but still had to persist with daily chemotherapy treatment for three years and regular lumbar punctures.</p>
      <p>A keen footballer, Oscar plays for both Kilmarnock and Partick Thistle and was back playing weeks after his stint in hospital and throughout his treatment. He also plays boys’ club football at Galston.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The school has been fantastic with Oscar and very supportive of everything we’ve been through,” Claire said.</p>
      <p>“The entire village of Kilmaurs has been terrific with us. We had to be careful with things like chickenpox and colds because they could really harm Oscar.</p>
      <p>“So I would get Facebook messages from parents I didn’t even know letting me know their kid had scarlet fever or whatever.</p>
      <p>“Oscar’s never had a birthday party because of his treatment so we’ll be hosting a big party for him next year.”</p>
