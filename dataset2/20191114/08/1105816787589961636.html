      <h1>PPP refuses to join Maulana's 'Plan B'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:03:21+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/170/hafeez-tunio/" target="_blank">Hafeez Tunio</a></address>
      <p>The Pakistan People’s Party on Thursday distanced itself from Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s ‘Plan B’, stating that the party will not participate in blocking roads and highways.</p>
      <p>Soon after the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief called off his sit-in in Islamabad, Fazl said that the protest movement set off by the ‘Azadi March’ would spread to every corner of the country, blocking “major arteries and highways – and even bylanes and streets”.</p>
      <p>“From day one our policy is clear. We will not become a party of dharna politics. We supported the Azadi March, but can’t come on the roads at this moment,” a senior PPP leader said, adding that the party’s chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has convened a party meeting to further discuss the issue.</p>
      <p>PPP Sindh General Secretary Waqar Mehdi told <i>The Express Tribune</i> that no one from his party would join the sit-ins on main roads and highways. “We only extend our support to a peaceful struggle. The blockage of roads is not on our agenda,” he added.</p>

      <p>Maulana Fazlur Rehman abruptly called off his sit-in where thousands of his followers and activists of allied parties had been camping since November 1, calling for Prime Minister Imran Khan to step aside and call fresh elections.</p>
      <p>“We’ve decided that we would not stage sit-ins in cities as this would affect the lives of fellow citizens. We’ve decided that we would stage sit-ins on main roads and highways outside the main cities,” the cleric said.</p>
