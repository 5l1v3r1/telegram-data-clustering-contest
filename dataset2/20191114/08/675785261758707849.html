      <h1>Tyson Fury denies being drug cheat as heavyweight recalls failed test</h1>
      <h2>Fury tested positive for nandrolone before his win over Wladimir Klitschko and received a backdated two-year ban</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:31:35+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:31</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has insisted he is not a drug cheat despite a positive test for nandrolone in 2015.</p>
      <p>The former heavyweight world champion was handed a backdated two-year ban in 2017 which allowed him to resume his career.</p>
      <p>He and cousin Hughie, also a boxer, blamed their high levels of the steroid on eating uncastrated wild boar.</p>
      <p>Fury does not mention that in his autobiography <i>Behind The Mask</i> , but insists he has never cheated.</p>
      <p>"From February 2015 to December 2017 a cloud of suspicion hung over me relating to an accusation that a high level of nandrolone had been found in my system and that of my cousin, Hughie Fury," he writes.</p>
      <p>"I had to resolve this before I could truly believe I could fight again. I had been tested regularly by the drugs people at UKAD (UK Anti-Doping), probably more than most boxers, and when the case with them finally came to a conclusion they were able to list a series of tests that came back negative.</p>

      <p>"The issue of the raised level of nandrolone came in a test in February 2016, but I wasn’t made aware of possible charges against me until long after that.</p>
      <p>"The body naturally produces nandrolone but mine had a high level for some reason. I can categorically state, however, that I have never taken any performance-enhancing drugs and never will.</p>
      <p>"The big question that did remain after the case was resolved was why it had taken UKAD so long to sort it out. Why did they leave me in limbo, allowing people to call me a drugs cheat, allowing me to be humiliated like that?"</p>
      <p>The two-year legal battle almost bankrupted UKAD before Fury was cleared to return to the ring.</p>
      <p>Two facile victories set up a shot at world champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in a fight which ended in a controversial draw.</p>

      <p>Fury is set to take on the American again next February but feels the sport attempted to write him off.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't help feeling at the time that other forces were at work in the background," he says. "Boxing is a shady business and when I reflect on that period, I can’t help but feel that if some people felt that they couldn't beat me in the ring, they had to get me out of boxing another way.</p>
      <p>"But God was on my side and when God is on your side, who should you be afraid of? Nobody! When the case did come to a conclusion, the statement by UKAD made it clear that they could not establish why I had that raised level of nandrolone.</p>
      <p>"The case cost over £1 million in lawyers’ fees and it was discussed in the press that if I had won the case – which I know I would have – then it could have left UKAD bankrupt.</p>
      <p>"But that could easily have meant another three or four years battling in court. Anyway, the case was finally cleared up and I could seriously start thinking about fighting again."</p>
