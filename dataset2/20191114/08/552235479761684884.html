      <h1>North Lanarkshire Council's gift card appeal boosted by encouraging efforts of employers</h1>
      <h2>Several companies have placed drop-off points in their premises</h2>

      <p>Generous employers are supporting North Lanarkshire Council’s Give-a-Gift-Card appeal.</p>
      <p>Amey, Indeglas, Engie and Sidey are some of the companies contributing to the campaign by placing drop-off points in their premises and encouraging employees to donate gift cards worth at least £10.</p>
      <p>The aim of the appeal is to make sure no child or teenager in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/north-lanarkshire-council">North Lanarkshire</a> is left without a present this Christmas, but also to empower their families to choose the present that best suits the age and interests of their youngsters.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The council’s deputy leader Paul Kelly said: “We are grateful that so many companies in North Lanarkshire are getting behind our gift card appeal.</p>
      <p>“Their backing is important to guarantee its success, and to prove that when the council, our local communities and businesses join forces great things can be achieved.”</p>
