      <h1>South Korea calls for peaceful solution to Hong Kong protests</h1>

      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- South Korea's foreign ministry expressed concern Thursday over the intensifying anti-government protests in Hong Kong, calling for a peaceful resolution of the situation.</p>
      <p>"South Korea and Hong Kong have a close relationship in terms of economic and people-to-people exchanges. We are paying attention to the recent situation in Hong Kong with concern," ministry spokesman Kim In-chul told a regular briefing.</p>
      <p>"We hope that Hong Kong's situation will be resolved peacefully at an early date and Hong Kong's prosperity and development will continue," he said.</p>
      <p>Recent clashes between police and civilians in Hong Kong have paralyzed parts of the financial hub in yet another escalation of the violence that has persisted for five months.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, anti-government protesters forced schools to close and blocked highways and other means of transportation, after two civilians suffered critical injuries in the latest confrontations.</p>
      <p>Asked if the government has plans to take protective measures for South Koreans in Hong Kong, a ministry official told reporters that the ministry is watching the situation closely and is looking into a possible adjustment of its travel warning for the country.</p>
      <p>In August, the government issued a "navy warning" for Hong Kong, the lowest of the four-phase travel alert system that calls for caution.</p>
