      <h1>Bafana watch | Beware the Ayew brothers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:59:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author">Tashreeq Vardien - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - It's rare that you find brothers representing their national team at the same time, but the Ayew brothers - Andre and Jordan - are two of <b>Ghana's</b> players to watch when they host <b>Bafana Bafana</b> on Thursday, writes <b>Tashreeq Vardien</b>.</p>
      <p>South Africa departed on Monday for Accra, the capital of Ghana, with hopes of returning on Friday with three points in their <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualification opener.</p>
      <p>The match will take place at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium at <b>21:00 (SA time)</b>.</p>
      <p>The meeting with Bafana Bafana could not have come at a better time for the Ghanaians as the Ayew brothers are in scintillating form for their respective clubs.</p>
      <p>Both, Andre and Jordan, ply their trade for top sides in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Andre, captain of the Black Stars, is an important figure at Welsh side Swansea City in the Championship while Jordan, 28, dons the colours of Crystal Palace in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Just over a year ago, Jordan was also on Swansea's books and the pair were also previously team-mates at French Ligue 1 side Marseille.</p>
      <p>At Swansea this season, Andre has netted four goals with three assists in 14 matches as the Welsh outfit fight for promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>His ability to drop into space and use it to his advantage has worked in his favour for much of his career. He is especially dangerous around the penalty area where he can shoot with either foot or smartly pick up a pass that could lead to a goal.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Palace manager Roy Hodgson has entrusted Jordon with leading the Eagles' attacking line as he keeps the robust Christian Benteke on the bench. After 11 appearances since the start of the campaign, Jordan has scored four goals with his natural striker's instinct.</p>
      <p>He usually drops into midfield to collect the ball on the counter-attack and with his pace, he can cause concern for defenders.</p>
      <p>But it is his poaching prowess which often comes in handy in the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Bafana will have to be technically disciplined as they have let in goals due to a poor defensive approach in the past.</p>
      <p>If a well-orchestrated defensive plan is not in place, it could end up being a rather long 90 minutes for the South Africans.</p>
