      <p>Disney Plus says it hit more than 10 million sign-ups on its first day of launch, far exceeding expectations.</p>
      <p>The entertainment giantâ€™s mix of Marvel and Star Wars movies and shows, classic animated films and new series appears to be an immediate hit after its launch.</p>
      <p>Disney has invested billions in its streaming service, which costs 7 dollars a month or 70 dollars a year after a seven-day free trial.</p>

      <p>Customers of some phone and home-internet plans were offered a year free.</p>
      <p>Disney did not break down where the subscriptions came from or if they were free or paid monthly or yearly. Some analysts thought it would take Disney a year to reach 10 million subscribers.</p>
      <p>Netflix has garnered 158 million subscribers since launching its streaming platform in 2007.</p>
