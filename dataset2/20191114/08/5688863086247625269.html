        <b>With age catching up to him, Luis Suarez has admitted that Barcelona are right to start looking for his replacement and it’s the way the game works. The superstar-striker has struggled over the last few years but has still stepped whenever required but this season has changed a lot for both sides.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since his move from Liverpool in the summer of 2014, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/luis_suarez">Luis Suarez</a> has been a consistent figure for Barcelona. The Uruguayan’s goalscoring ability is legendary but his work ethic and willingness to run about the field in search for the ball has simply elevated his status for the club. But, with age catching up to him the 32-year-old has struggled to make an impact over the last few years.</p>
      <p>This season has seen him struggle more often than not with just 8 goals after 13 appearances for the club. But the ageing striker has gone on to admit that Barcelona are right to start looking for his replacement amid links to Kylian Mbappe and Lautaro Martinez. The 32-year-old also added that despite his struggles, he will give everything he has to the club for as long as they let him.</p>
      <p>"The demands at Barcelona are immense. Every three days you have to have a test, there is no rest, and you are not forgiven if you have even just one bad game. It is not easy to play at a club like Barcelona, to adapt and win your place. I have to respect that I have spent five years at the club dealing with this pressure and always trying to respond in the right manner,” said Suarez reports the Mirror.</p>
      <p>"If the club are looking for, or wish to bring in another number nine, it would not be strange, it is the reality of football. A time will arrive when my age will not allow me to play at the level Barcelona require, but while I can, and while I have the strength to compete, I will."</p>
