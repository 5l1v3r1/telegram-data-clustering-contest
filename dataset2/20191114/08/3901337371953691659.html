      <p>A LaLiga manager has discussed new ways of trying to stop FC Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi from scoring free-kicks, but appears to have accepted there is no way to thwart the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.</p>

      <p>The Argentine has struck on four occasions from direct set-pieces for the Blaugrana already this season, including two in his latest match against Celta Vigo.</p>
      <p>Messi and Barca will take on Leganes next after the international break, and their manager Javier Aguirre does not believe there is a way to properly stop the 32-year-old.</p>
      <p>Aguirre was even asked if taking away a wall when Messi stands over free-kicks might help, but he was not confident this would be an effective strategy.</p>

      <p>"Well, I have no idea (how to stop him), because every team that I have faced him with, I could never stop him, that I remember. A small draw here and there, perhaps," he told <i>Cadena SER.</i></p>
      <p>"One of the coaching staff proposed it today, and I told him, 'Look, if I leave Messi outside the box against (Leganes goalkeeper) Pichu Cuellar, I give him 10 balls and he'll score 11 goals'. There is no way.</p>
      <p>"In the end, we have discussed it a lot (not deploying a wall for free-kicks). If we put one guy under the post, another laying on the ground... we try 20 000 ways.</p>
      <p>"The most logical thing to do is to avoid unnecessary fouls. But it's also not possible, because he escapes from you, the scoundrel!"</p>

      </p>
      <p>Messi has scored 52 free-kicks in his career so far, and is among 13 players who have scored 50 or more times from set-pieces in their career.</p>
