      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14691"/>Intel has released a bit of info on their Xe line of GPUs, and that info is rather limited. First off, the product will be fabbed at a 7nm node. Secondly, and yeah think of this what you will, it's going to use HBM graphics memory, which is rather complicated and expensive to use, fabricate and buy.</p>
      <p>It, however, is likely that the enterprise parts will get some form of HBM graphics memory, and the consumer parts some sort of GDDR6 kind of graphics memory. As history has proven, for consumer parts that has been problemsome.</p>
      <p>Interesting other news is that Intel has shared the codename for Xe, the GPU is codenamed Ponte Vecchio -- an old stone <b>bridge</b> in Florence, Italy. Why did I highlight that bridge part? Well, what about the rumor of a PCIe 5.0-based Compute Express Link Interconnect. That's a rather fast way of <b>bridging</b> a CPU with GPUs. Ponte Vecchio GPU would be using Foveros packaging technology and CLX (Compute Express Link) interconnects. Then HBM. It was also mentioned that Ponte Vecchio will feature high double-precision FP throughput. </p>
