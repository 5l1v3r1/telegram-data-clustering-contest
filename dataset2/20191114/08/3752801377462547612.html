      <p>Amy'Leigh de Jager, the six-year-old girl who was kidnapped in front of Laerskool Kollegepark in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng, at around 07:40 on September 2, has not been coping well since the harrowing ordeal, says her mother, Angeline, 26.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.enca.com/news/amy-leigh-not-coping-after-kidnapping">eNCA</a> on Wednesday, Angeline said: "It is not going well, she is struggling. She has never been afraid of people, which she is now, she doesn't trust easily; even us as parents struggle to gain her trust again." </p>
      <p>Amy'Leigh was snatched from her mother's arms in front of the school and driven off in a white Toyota Fortuner, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-grade-r-girl-kidnapped-in-front-of-vaal-school-20190902">News24</a> reported.  </p>
      <p>After a failed ransom demand of R2m, she was dropped off in the centre of town and taken to a police station by two passers-by and reunited with her parents. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Four people have <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-amyleigh-kidnapping-arrests-made-one-suspect-known-to-parents-20190905">been arrested</a> for Amy'Leigh's kidnapping, including now suspended Grade RR teacher Tharina Human, who was a friend of the De Jager family and their son's teacher. </p>
      <p>Human and so-accused Pieter van Zyl and Bafokeng Molemohi are still in custody, while Laetitia Nel was granted bail of R25 000. </p>
      <p>Human allegedly orchestrated the kidnapping to pay a debt to drug dealers.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the four made a brief appearance in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate's Court.</p>
      <p>In the family's first TV interview since the kidnapping, Angeline describes the past two months as "hell". </p>
      <p>"It's sad," Angeline told eNCA. "It's disappointing that people who were so close to you and whom you trusted, especially with your children - she [Human] was my child's teacher... it makes it difficult knowing that someone would do that to you..."</p>
      <p>The accused will be back in court on January 9 next year.</p>
