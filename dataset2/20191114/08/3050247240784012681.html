      <h1>Crypto.com Reveals Its 2020 Plan for World Domination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:41:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author">Agustin Beltramino</a></address>
      <p>Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek unveiled his company's 2020 expansion plan in a talk today at BlockShow Asia 2019 in Singapore.</p>
      <p>The plans include launching its own exchange, shipping VISA MCO cards to almost every region in the world, and launching a non-custodial wallet.</p>
      <p>With the motto that “it’s your basic human right to control your money, data, and identity,” Marszalek spoke about Crypto.com’s vision to create an ecosystem where people can manage every aspect of their crypto holdings in one place: pay, buy, sell, trade, exchange, fundraise, and so on. He revealed the entire roadmap to get there over the course of 2020.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocom-launches-new-exchange-eyeing-top-10-spot-within-5-years">reported</a>, Crypto.com will launch its exchange with initial support for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), Ethereum (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), Ripple (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>), Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index">EOS</a>, XLM, MCO, and USDT. Now we know the platform will be powered by the Crypto.com Coin (CRO). This native digital token will provide additional utility and benefits to users, including liquidity, low fees, and better execution prices.</p>
      <p>Marszalek said they are “assuming it will be easy for us to break into the top 10 exchanges in the next five years or so. We have a systematic way to grind our way to the top.”</p>
      <p>The company also wants to make its crypto-compatible Visa card available in almost every region of the world. Marszalek said it will soon be available in Canada, LATAM, all APAC countries, and the entire European Union.</p>
