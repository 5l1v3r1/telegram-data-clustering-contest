      <h1>Tyson Fury opens up on split with trainer Peter following Wladimir Klitschko win</h1>
      <h2>Fury split with his trainer and uncle Peter Fury after his stunning win over Klitschko in 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:17:49+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has admitted his relationship with his former trainer and uncle Peter is beyond repair.</p>
      <p>The uncle-nephew combination reached a peak in 2015 when Fury beat Wladimir Klitschko to become heavyweight champion of the world.</p>
      <p>But they split the following year with Fury teaming up with rookie trainer Ben Davison for his comeback last year.</p>
      <p>Writing in his book, <i>Behind The Mask,</i> Fury also admitted he also has no relationship with former promoter Mick Hennessy having since linked up with Frank Warren.</p>
      <p>"Back in 2014, I didn't know that the forthcoming fight with Wladimir Klitschko would be my last with Mick Hennessy as my manager and with my uncle, Peter Fury, as my trainer," writes Fury.</p>

      <p>"It’s sad that the split had to happen because Mick, Peter and I had a very good bond at one point, but it was a decision that had to be taken.</p>
      <p>"Nowadays, there is no relationship between me and Peter or with Mick. It’s very sad, but with me, like most people I guess, once a relationship is broken it’s very hard to fix it. It hit me hard when I realised I couldn’t work with them again.</p>
      <p>"As for Peter, it’s heart-breaking how our relationship disintegrated because at one point in my life he was like a second father to me.</p>

      <p>My dad had gone to jail in February 2011 and had been handed an eleven-year sentence but was allowed out in February 2015.</p>
      <p>"During his time in prison, my brother Shane and I practically lived with Peter. Everywhere Peter went, I was there.</p>
      <p>"When I look back to those times and see how my relationship with Peter now has broken down it’s tough to take but sadly I've had to move on."</p>
      <p>Fury is currently preparing for his rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> having drawn with the world champion in Los Angeles last year.</p>
