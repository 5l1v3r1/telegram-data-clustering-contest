      <h3>#1 Make A Shopping List</h3>
      <p>Make a list of the items you most want and do some research so you know what a reasonable price to pay for each item is. Have that list next to you when you’re shopping.</p>
      <h3>#2 Set A Budget</h3>
      <p>Create a plan for how much you’re going to spend and don’t get caught up in the excitement and spend outside your limit.</p>
      <h3>#3 Check Where Items Are Coming From</h3>
      <p>Make sure items are coming from retailers that you’re confident will honour warranties in case something goes wrong.</p>
      <h3>#4 Shipping</h3>
