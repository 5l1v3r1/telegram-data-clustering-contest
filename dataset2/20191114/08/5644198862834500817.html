      <p>MELBOURNE: Andy Murray will play Grigor Dimitrov in the opening round of the ATP Cup, with Bulgaria qualifying among the final six teams in the nation-based tournament.</p>
      <p>Murray, on the comeback trail after hip surgery, was initially to face Roger Federer in a blockbuster Group C clash in Sydney.</p>

      <p>Federer however pulled out of the tournament, making Switzerland ineligible. Murray will instead face Dimitrov, the man nicknamed "Baby Fed" for his similar playing style to the Swiss master.</p>
      <p>Britain and Bulgaria will also play Belgium in Group C.</p>
      <p>The other five teams to complete in the 24-nation field at the close of the second deadline are Chile, Poland, Uruguay, Moldova and Norway.</p>
      <p>Their placement in the six groups of four for the round-robin phase will be confirmed at a draw later on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The group winners and the two best second-placed finishers across the groups reach the ATP Cup Finals in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Each tie comprises two singles and one doubles match.</p>
      <p>Top-ranked Novak Djokovic and world number two Rafa Nadal have confirmed they will play.</p>
