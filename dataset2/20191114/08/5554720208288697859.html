      <h1>Shloka Mehta in never-seen-before ‘red hot’ avatar as Mukesh and Nita Ambani welcome Bollywood stars</h1>

      <p>Shloka Mehta has often earned praise from her fans for her simplicity and natural beauty even sans makeup. However, when she made an appearance at the pre-wedding function of husband Akash Ambani’s cousin recently, an immediate comparison was da=rawn with the likes of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Mira Rajput. There was a general consensus that Shloka had beaten both Aishwarya and Mira, two of the most popular names known for their style quotient, in the fashion game.</p>

      <p>Shloka’s lace lavender separates with a similar colour long-line lace jacket and an emerald and diamond choker was enough to make the Ambani <i>bahu </i>one of the best-dressed ladies at the pre-wedding function of Arjun Kothari, nephew of Mukesh and Nita Ambani. But Shloka did not stop here. For another function, she chose a single shoulder red lace mini dress with floral diamond danglers paired with white Greek-style slippers.</p>

      <p>In the second outfit, Nita Ambani’s daughter-in-law was also seen <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/stunning-shloka-mehta-outsmarts-aishwarya-rai-bachchan-mira-rajput-at-party-hosted-by-in-laws-mukesh-and-nita-ambani/272194/">doing away</a> with her usual no-makeup rule and looked like a glamorous diva. Celebrity makeup artist and hairstylist  Ojas Rajani took to Instagram to reveal that she was the person behind Shloka’s new ‘red hot’ look.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote, “Wow, you’ve changed her (Shloka completely).” Other wrote, “Red Hot.”</p>

      <p>What Shloka and Isha wore for Arjun Kothari’s pre-wedding function had dominated the conversations on social media. Not to be left behind, <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/in-diamond-belt-and-romantic-sleeveless-lace-sari-isha-ambani-overshadows-aishwarya-rai-bachchan-and-mira-rajput-at-party-hosted-by-mother-nita-ambani/272314/">Isha too</a> had chosen Anamika Khanna and Abu Jani -Sandeep Khosla for her two outfits. Isha was first seen in a sleeveless sharara-saree designed by Anamika Khanna at the event. Later, she also wore a powder lilac and gold, French Chantilly lace saree. The creation, according to the designers, was lavishly embroidered in gold and silver <i>zardozi</i>, crystals, sequins and bugle beads to exceptional effect.</p>
