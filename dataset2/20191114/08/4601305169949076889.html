      <p>This good boy is named Narwhal. And yes, he has a tail growing from his head. Kind folks rescued from the cold outdoors in Kansas City, Mo. and took the 10-week-old pup to Mac's Mission, a nonprofit animal shelter in Jackson, Mo. From <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/puppy-tail-growing-head-rescued-193719182.html">Yahoo!</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Once situated in Jackson, Narwhal was evaluated by Dr. Brian Heuring, a veterinarian at Cape Small Animal Clinic, who was able to share a good prognosis on the pup's signature appendage — and no, it doesn't wag, if you were wondering. <br/><br/>"Dr. Heuring is completely not on board with cutting it off at this point," (shelter founder Rochelle) Steffen shared of the extra tail, which is said to be about a third of the size of the tail on Narwhal's posterior. "We took X-rays and there is no medical reason for it to be removed, other than just cosmetic." <br/><br/>"We are always willing to do the medically necessary thing to make sure our animals have a good quality of life, but at this point, it doesn't bother him, it's not in his way," she continued. "He doesn't know any different, so he just runs and plays and is wild, like a normal puppy with a tail on his face."</blockquote>
