      <h1>Arsenal engulfed in bitter spat as Raul Sanllehi 'blocks appointment' of club legend to Gunners board</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal board members including Sir Chips Keswick are reportedly keen on the appointment of David O'Leary - but head of football Sanllehi is at odds with them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T08:10:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have reportedly been engulfed in a bitter row with chairman Sir Chips Keswick and head of football Raul Sanllehi at odds over the potential appointment of club legend David O'Leary to the Gunners board.</p>
      <p>Keswick is keen to enlist the help of O'Leary as a football consultant in an official capacity to advise the board on football matters.</p>
      <p>But the move has been met by resistance from Sanllehi, report the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7682573/Arsenal-engulfed-row-David-OLearys-place-board.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>Sanllehi appointed former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> midfielder Eduo as the club's first technical director over the summer and the Spaniard - who was previously at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> - seemingly doesn't feel the need for O'Leary in a newly-created football position.</p>

      <p>O'Leary is currently a club ambassador at the Emirates and is seen at the majority of Arsenal home games.</p>
      <p>He spent 19 years in north London as a player and has close links to some senior figures at the club - including Keswick who has been chairman since 2013.</p>

      <p>Arsenal have made a disappointing start to the season with defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday leaving them eight points off the top-four pace after just 12 fixtures.</p>
      <p>They are already 17 points adrift of pace-setting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> at the top of the league and face an uphill battle to restore their position at Europe's top table.</p>
      <p>Boss Unai Emery is under huge pressure to keep his job with the Gunners having not tasted victory in the Premier League since early October.</p>
      <p>There have also been reports of some players mocking Emery behind his back for his perceived poor grasp of English.</p>
