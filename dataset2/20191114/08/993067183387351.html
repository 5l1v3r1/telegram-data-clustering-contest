      <p>A home which cost £335,000 to build has been named House of the Year.</p>
      <p>House Lessans, a three-bedroom property with white rendered, concrete walls, was built on the site of a former farmstead.</p>
      <p>The L-shaped property is located in Saintfield in Co Down.</p>

      <p>Judges for the RIBA House of the Year 2019 said House Lessans cost £1,425 a square metre, totalling £335,000 to build, “a remarkable achievement for a newly built home of this scale”.</p>
      <p>RIBA president Alan Jones said: “House Lessans demonstrates that life-enhancing architecture does not have to cost the earth…</p>
      <p>“Even with the tightest of budgets, House Lessans shows that a dream home, designed by a talented architect, can be a reality.”</p>
      <p>Sylvia and Michael, the owners of the property, said they stuck with one bathroom because there would be less cleaning, despite some people saying they should have more.</p>

      <p>“It is a joy to live in – from seeing the soaring bedroom ceiling on wakening, being surrounded by the gentle landscape in the kitchen during the day, to enjoying the sunset in the top room,” they said.</p>
      <p>Architect Kieran McGonigle, of the firm McGonigle McGrath, said the house “we hope, extends our understanding of how to make buildings in our countryside”.</p>
      <p>The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) presents the award to the UK’s best new architect-designed house.</p>
      <p>House Lessans was revealed as the winner in the final episode of a special Channel 4 series, Grand Designs: House Of The Year.</p>
