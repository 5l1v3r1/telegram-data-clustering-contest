      <p><b>SINGAPORE: </b>A piece of skin about the size of your thumbnail can be printed in less than a minute, scientists in Singapore say, a game-changing step for the future of non-animal testing for cosmetics and other products.</p>
      <p>Made up of skin cells from donors and collagen, the in-vitro skin has the same chemical and biological properties as human skin, says John Koh, lab manager at start-up DeNova Sciences, which is collaborating with Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University on the product.</p>

      <p>“We can see that the industry is moving towards animal-free testing,” Koh said.</p>
      <p>“So we really want to offer a solution to testing on the skin without using animal or human skin.”</p>
      <p>The team has accelerated the manufacturing process by using a printing machine to put in precisely patterned layers that mimic human skin. Each tiny piece of skin takes less than a minute to print, which is the distinctive quality of this project.</p>

      <p>The mixture is then incubated for about two weeks, as the skin cells multiply and gain opacity, turning into a whitish membrane.</p>
      <p>The skin can be used to test the toxicity or irritation potential of a substance, and the penetrative qualities of active ingredients in products like cosmetics.</p>
      <p>His team is now focusing on developing skin that includes Asian pigment cells to test the whitening effects of cosmetics and skincare products.</p>
