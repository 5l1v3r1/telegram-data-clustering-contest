      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/google">Google</a> is trying to help travellers to get the necessary information in their local languages. To this end, it is integrating Google Translate into Google Maps. This will ensure that travellers can look up maps in familiar languages. This will also help to obtain an accurate translation of the geographical names and addresses. With this information, they can know exactly what to ask from the locals in terms of direction to their destination.</p>

      <p>Google Maps product manager, Laszlo de Brissac, said they hope to help by combining “Google Maps and Google Translate”. This feature not only provides text translation but also voice translation. There will be a small speaker icon, clicking on the icon will automatically read the message aloud in the local language. In addition, there will also be a separate option for the address.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the corresponding function dialog box links directly to Google Translate. Users can continue to communicate with local people by translating subsequent phrases (such as “Thank you for your help”). Thus eliminating the issue of language barriers to a large extent.</p>
      <p>This is also the first time that Google has established a deep integration between the two platforms of map and translation to further enhance synergy. The feature plans to log into the Google Maps app on iOS and Android next month. For now, it will support 50 languages and the company will certainly add more languages in the future.</p>
