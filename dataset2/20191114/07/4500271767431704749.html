      <p>ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in its Executive Board’s Meeting, presided over by chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal, decided on Wednesday to close down several inquiries and investigations and not to open new cases.</p>

      <blockquote>Chairman says attention being paid to taking mega corruption cases to logical conclusion</blockquote>
      <p>The handout said that the anti-graft watchdog was policy-bound to share details of the decisions taken by the EBM with the people.</p>
      <p>“The inquiries and investigations are being initiated on the basis of ... allegations and, therefore, allegations must not be considered as final. The final decision about initiating proceedings against any accused is taken after knowing point of view of both sides,” it said.</p>
      <p>The EBM also decided to further examine the case against owners/directors and others of Al Tutmish Medical Society and ongoing inquiry being conducted against Ghulam Shabbir Sheikh, former acting IG of Sindh, and others in the abuse of authority case etc.</p>
      <p>The NAB board also approved closure of the inquiry against officers/officials of KDA, government of Sindh, in the light of the Supreme Court orders.</p>

      <p>“NAB is now concentrating on taking mega corruption cases to their logical conclusion,” he said.</p>
      <p>By pursuing the policy of Accountability for All, he said, NAB had recovered Rs 71 billion directly or indirectly over the last 23 months.</p>
      <p>He said the World Economic Forum in its recent report had lauded the bureau’s performance.</p>
      <p>“The overall conviction rate of NAB cases is over 70 per cent,” he added.</p>
      <p>The NAB chief said the bureau had filed 610 corruption references in accountability courts over the past 23 months and it was striving to recover billions of rupees looted from the people from 44 suspects now under custody of officials in Modaraba / Musharaka scams.</p>
