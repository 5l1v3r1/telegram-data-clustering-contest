      <h1>Republican congressman tweets hidden Epstein conspiracy theory</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:43:54+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Alex Woodward</a></address>
      <p>A Republican congressman used a cryptic string of tweets to promote a conspiracy theory that claims <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> did not die by his own hand in prison.</p>
      <p>In a series of 23 tweets during <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-hearings-president-put-personal-political-demands-ahead-of-ukraines-interests-us-a9202271.html">the first day of public impeachment hearings</a>, Arizona’s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paul-gosar">Paul Gosar</a> arranged the first letter in each to spell out the phrase “Epstein didn’t kill himself”, if they were read in reverse order.</p>
      <p>It echoed a conspiracy meme that suggests the alleged serial abuser and convicted trafficker’s August suicide was actually a murder, and which has been fuelled by the ex-financier's links to high society. Epstein, a former personal friend of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, was in prison in Florida awaiting trial when he was found dead in his cell.</p>
      <p>Mr Gosar used his tweets to express support for Mr Trump and denounce the impeachment hearings as a “circus”.</p>
      <p>“Evidence of a link between foreign aid and political investigations simply does not exist. The longer this circus continues the clearer it becomes that @realDonaldTrump has done absolutely nothing wrong,” he claimed, wrongly.</p>
      <p>Top diplomats have testified that a so-called quid pro quo deal was put to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, pressuring him to publicly announce an investigation into Joe Biden’s family in exchange for military aid.</p>
      <p>A Trump ally and conspiracy theorist who believes that white nationalist violence in Charlottesville in 2017 was “created by the left”, Mr Gosar is an immigration hard-liner who sponsored an attempt to repeal birthright citizenship.</p>
      <p>He followed Wednesday’s thread with a single six-line tweet using the first letters of each sentence to spell out “Area 51”, the popular name for the military installation at Groom Lake, Nevada.</p>
      <p>“All of the tweets pertained to today’s hearing. Rest assured, they are substantive. Every one of them. All of them. 5 were brilliant. 1 was okay,” he said. Earlier this year the base became the target of an internet meme – “storm Area 51” – that spilled over into the outside world.</p>
      <p>Last autumn, during the midterm congressional elections, Mr Gosar’s six siblings <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/paul-gosar-attack-advert-siblings-david-brill-arizona-2018-midterm-elections-a8550351.html">starred in a deeply critical campaign advert</a> for his Democratic opponent that told voters the 60-year-old “doesn’t have your interests at heart”.</p>
      <p>David Gosar, one of Paul Gosar’s brothers, has previously called his sibling’s performance in Congress “ridiculous”.</p>
