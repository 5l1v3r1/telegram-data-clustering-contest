        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 14 – Delegates in the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25) which kicked off on Tuesday in Nairobi Wednesday called for the formulation of policies to address harmful practices affecting girls and women.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The delegates made the appeal during the “Ending Harmful Practices –Making Commitments Real” forum held on the sidelines of the global conference.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“As much as the prevalence has gone down we recognize that these harmful practices still violate the rights and dignity of women and girls not only in Kenya but all over the world, with a negative impact from their physical, mental and reproductive health as well as their overall being,” Cabinet Secretary for the Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs Margaret Kobia who attended the forum noted.</p>
      <p>Gender Based Violence (GBV), Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and child marriages remain harmful practices that violate the rights of women and girls globally.</p>
      <p>Around the world, girls and women battle commonly held views and beliefs that limit their opportunities and potential.</p>
      <p>Myths such as investing in women doesn’t pay off, gender inequality is not an issue in developed countries, sexual reproductive health and rights, family-friendly, gender-responsive policies are not worth the investment – just to name a few, are robbing women of their power to advance themselves, their families, their communities, and ultimately, their nations.</p>
      <p>In Kenya, 23pc of girls are married before their 18th birthday. Almost a half that is 45pc of women aged between 15-49 have experienced physical violence since age 15.</p>
      <p>14pc of the women aged between 15-49 have experienced sexual violence making the economic burden of GBV survivors very high.</p>
      <p>Kobia noted the commitments made by the government in ending the harmful practices within a generation, putting in place policies, legal frameworks and institutions over the years strengthening the capacity of these institutions and allocated budgets to support prevention and response to GBV and harmful cultural practices.</p>
      <p>“We continue to build strategic partnerships with Civil Society Organizations (CSO) and research and academia institutions and the private sector to ensure we achieve Zero GBV and the harmful practices by the year 2020 as provided in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).”</p>
      <p>Last week President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a landmark declaration incorporating the governments Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia and Ethiopia in a new plan to address cross border FGM practice.</p>
      <p>Kenyatta undertook to work with his counterparts in the region to ensure those who perpetuate harmful cultural practices are brought to book regardless of whether the practices are committed outside the country.</p>
      <p>Kenya also launched a Johari Beads initiative which, according to CS Kobia, will not only contribute to the ending of FGM but also economically empower the girls through the bead work which they will sell to generate income.</p>
      <p>“When women are economically empowered, their voice of saying “NO” is stronger.  This is one of the strategies guided by the national policy on eradication of FGM which was developed in 2019,” Kobia explained.</p>
