      <p>It is believed that both the big guns of South African football Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs are keeping a close eye on AmaZulu’s Bonginkosi Ntuli.</p>
      <p>Ntuli is AmaZulu’s leading goalscorer this season, having scored all of the team’s seven goals so far in their campaign.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As reported in edition 1149 of Soccer Laduma, indication is that the 28-year-old striker could get a second bite of the apple at one of the so-called Big Three of the PSL, following his unsuccessful spell with Mamelodi Sundowns, before he joined AmaZulu on a permanent deal. </p>
      <p>“Bonginkosi Ntuli’s form for AmaZulu and his knack for scoring goals resulted in him attracting interest from big clubs in the PSL. I can confirm that both Pirates and Chiefs are eyeing the player,” confirmed a source.</p>

      <p>“The boy is among the leading goalscorers in the PSL early on in the season and it’s not surprising that there’s this huge interest in his services,” the source added.  </p>
      <p>When Ntuli was signed by Sundowns in 2014, the Brazilians had edged the Buccaneers to his signature, with the 23-year-old at the time on the back of an impressive season with Golden Arrows. </p>
