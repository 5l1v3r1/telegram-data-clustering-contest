Set above the waters, there’s a chilled ambience and top views of Downtown Dubai’s skyline (hi, Burj Khalifa). As part of Eat, Sip, Save, Dubai’s Boardwalk is offering up a 1kg pot of steaming hot mussels and four bottles of hops for just Dhs149. More of a pizza fan? Enjoy a classic margherita (Dhs55) and you’ll get a Mexican mixed drink thrown in for free. Love seafood? Buy any 500g from seafood market and get 50 percent off selected grape too.<br/><i>Open daily noon-midnight. Dubai Creek Golf &amp; Yacht Club, Deira (04 295 6000).</i><br/><br/><b>La Baie</b><br/>If you’re a fan of swim-up bars (and let’s face it, who’s not?, click here for more) then you’ll be familiar with this super-cool spot at The Ritz-Carlton, Dubai. But if you’ve spent your time sipping a mixed drink in the cool pool rather than dining, things are set to change. As part of Eat, Sip, Save La Baie is offering up a deal you’d be mad to miss. For Dhs150 you’ll get pool access, plus the whole thing back on food and drink at the pool bar. Meanwhile, if you visit between 4pm and 6pm any day of the week you’ll get Italian bubbly for half price. Pack those swimmers.<br/><i>Open daily 11am-11pm.

If you’re after a snack, head here for sundowners as you’ll get two drinks and light bites for just Dhs99 per person, every day from 4pm until 7pm. And if that’s not enough for you, the restaurant is offering pool and beach access plus a family-style lunch for two people from Sunday to Thursday for Dhs495.<br/><i>Open daily noon-11pm.
