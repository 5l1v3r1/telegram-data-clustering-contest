      <h1>Pulisic, Barkley, Rudiger, Kante - Latest Chelsea injury news and expected return dates</h1>
      <h2>Who is out and who is a doubt for the Blues?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:48:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:48</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha, Tashan Deniran-Alleyne</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea have one of the biggest injury lists in the Premier League currently.</p>
      <p>So it is quite something that Frank Lampard has the Blues in third place in the table and challenging for the title.</p>
      <p>According to our friends at the Express, only Watford, West Ham, Aston Villa and Manchester United have more players on the treatment table right now than Lampard's Blues.</p>
      <p>But the head coach is working through the pain of the injury nightmare and has his Chelsea players in fine fettle on the pitch with six wins in a row heading into the international break.</p>
      <p>Lampard will hope the two-week break will give his stricken players the chance to get back in action afterwards.</p>
      <p>Next up is a trip to the Etihad Stadium to take on reigning Champions Manchester City after the international break.</p>
      <p>For such a big game, Lampard will be hoping that he has a fully fit squad to choose from.</p>
      <p>With that said, here's the latest Chelsea injury news and expected return dates.</p>
      <h3>Christian Pulisic</h3>
      <p>Chelsea face a nervous wait to discover the full extent of Christian Pulisic's hip injury after USA head coach Gregg Berhalter confirmed the winger will miss the upcoming international matches.</p>
      <p>"Christian is officially at this stage ruled out," he said.</p>

      <p>"We just got that information. This was a collaborative decision with the club. looking after the best interest of the player.</p>
      <p>"These decisions are always difficult because this group and the coaching staff want nothing more than to have Christian here, but it was a risk we weren’t willing to take at this time."</p>
      <h3>Antonio Rudiger</h3>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger had appeared to have Frank Lampard a welcome injury boost by declaring himself fit for the Blues' trip to Watford last week.</p>
      <p>The German centre back underwent knee surgery in the summer and has missed a good majority of the season, but won't be available until after the international break following an operation at the beginning of the week.</p>
      <p>"He had an operation and he is going to be out probably for three weeks, hopefully,"<a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/lampard-chelsea-press-conference-live-17218718">Lampard confirmed at his pre-Crystal Palace press conference</a>. "Then we will have to see where match fitness comes in because he has been out for a long time now.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"It was nice to get something definitive about it because we have been trying to find a solution and he has been having some issues. It is not easy for a player in that position. So hopefully we are at that stage and hopefully in three weeks time we are in a lot better place."</p>

      <h3>Ross Barkley</h3>
      <p>The midfielder has missed the last three Premier League games after picking up an ankle injury in the 1-0 win against Newcastle United last month.</p>
      <p>Lampard confirmed before the match that Barkley wouldn't be fit enough to make the squad for the visit of Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>The England international has been called up to Gareth Southgate's squad for the upcoming fixtures vs Montenegro and Kosovo over the international break.</p>
      <p>But, it was revealed on Sunday that the midfielder won't be part of the England squad for the qualifiers after pulling out because of the injury.</p>
      <h3>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</h3>
      <p>Loftus-Cheek was establishing himself as a key member of Maurizio Sarri's squad at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>However, in the post-season friendly ahead of the Europa League final, Loftus-Cheek suffered the same fate as Hudson-Odoi and ruptured his Achilles' tendon.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is still undergoing rehabilitation, with Loftus-Cheek working towards a return as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>"It’s going well!" He told <a href="https://versus.uk.com/2019/11/im-coming-back-stronger-ruben-loftus-cheek-ready-return-already-eyes-euro-2020/">Versus</a> when asked about his recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a long time and I’ve had a few setbacks as well. It’s never been just a straight path but I’m close now…I’ve been running and moving, I feel I’m right on the edge. I’m close and I can’t wait."</p>
      <p>Although, Lampard has <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/rudiger-loftus-cheek-chelsea-injuries-17225279">warned it could be a while yet before the midfielder</a> is available for selection.</p>

      <h3>Marco van Ginkel</h3>
      <p>The midfielder is a long term absentee, having suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman is on the way to recovery, having posted a video of himself working on the anti-gravity treadmill at the club's training ground.</p>

      <p>However, there is no return date provided for the 26-year-old as yet.</p>
      <h3>N'Golo Kante</h3>
      <p>Chelsea fans will be hoping the diminutive Frenchman has put his injury troubles behind him.</p>
      <p>Kante has only managed five Premier League games this season as a result of knee and ankle injuries.</p>
      <p>But he did return to the pitch for the win over Crystal Palace prior to the international break and it looks as though his troubles are well and truly behind him, with France boss Didier Deschamps calling him up for the games with Albania and Moldova.</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans will be keeping a close eye on what happens during the international break to make sure he does not have another recurrence of the injury problems he has suffered.</p>
      <p><b>Mason Mount</b> and <b>Tammy Abraham</b> were both substituted against Palace, but it's understood those were tactical changes and they should feature for England during the break.</p>
