      <p>The Ukrainian SkyUp flight was taxiing across the tarmac at Sharm el-Sheikh Airport on Saturday when the left landing gear caught fire, The Sun reported. The tabloid suggested that hydraulic fluid leaked onto the brakes, which were still hot, causing the wheel to catch on fire. Emergency crews quickly arrived to douse the fire, preventing a tragedy.</p>
