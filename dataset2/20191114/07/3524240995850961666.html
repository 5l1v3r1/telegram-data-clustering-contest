        <b>Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa</b>
      </p>
      <p>One person was killed on Wednesday in Bayelsa State after violence erupted during the Peoples Democratic Party’s campaign for Saturday’s governorship election.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the incident, which happened at Nembe-Ogbolomabiri in the Nembe Local Government Area, also left several persons injured.</p>
      <p>The deceased, whose identity was given as Simon Onu, was said to be the driver of the outside broadcast van of the state-owned radio station in Yenagoa.</p>
      <p>Some members of staff of the radio station confirmed the death of the OB van driver.</p>
      <p>The violence broke out about 24 hours after two policemen were said to have been killed by gunmen at a checkpoint at Otuogidi in the Ogbia LGA.</p>
      <p>Heavy shootings were said to have rocked the King Koko Square venue of the PDP rally at Nembe-Ogbolomabiri as yet-to-be-identified armed men opened fire shortly after party supporters gathered and were waiting for dignitaries to arrive.</p>
      <p>Governor Seriake Dickson and the PDP standard-bearer, Senator Douye Diri, were among party leaders that were to address the crowd.</p>
      <p>The campaign visit to Nembe LGA was said to be the last rally by the PDP before the governorship poll on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A source said, “Some boys threatened in Nembe yesterday (Tuesday) that they would not allow the PDP to hold their rally today (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>“Everyone ran in different directions when they started shooting.”</p>
      <p>However, the state PDP in a statement by the National Vice Chairman, South-South, Emmanuel Ogidi, said, “We have lost five persons and I saw the picture of a policeman who was injured. The Federal Government should take action immediately.</p>
      <p>Also, the Police Public Relations Officer, Asinim Butswat, did not answer calls to his mobile phone.</p>
