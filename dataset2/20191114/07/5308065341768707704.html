      <p>“I remember I wanted to hang out with you, but you were always on the tour bus, just learning guitar,” Cabello had said to Mendes.</p>
      <p>The <i>Treat You Better</i> singer confirmed that he had never talked to anybody on the entire tour except for Cabello. She was the only one that was willing to take the time to try to get to know him better.</p>
      <p>“I thought you were out of your mind,” Mendes told Cabello. “I’d be on my bus where no one could see me. I’d be looking through the window and I’d see you, like flying around on a scooter and jumping and doing cartwheels. I’d be like, ‘She’s insane.’ Close the window and go to sleep.”</p>
      <p>Rumours swirled around for years that the two were dating especially when they performed together.</p>
