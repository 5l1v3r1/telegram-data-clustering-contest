      <h1>The Morning After: Motorola RAZR returns as a $1,500 foldable phone</h1>
      <h2>And Apple delivers a 16-inch MacBook Pro.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:15:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>Two of the most-leaked products this year have been officially unveiled. We knew they were coming, but now we've seen Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-specs-pricing-hands-on-video/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> (and put our fingers on its revamped keyboard) as well as Motorola's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/motorola-razr-foldable-hands-on-preview-2019/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">foldable RAZR</a>. Beyond the new hardware, there's a deeply discounted iPad Pro to consider, and Netflix is teaming up with Nickelodeon to fight back against Disney+.</p>

      <p>To answer some of your likeliest questions: Yes, it's fast; no, it's not as big or as heavy as you think; no, there's still no SD card reader and yes, there's a new keyboard that brings back "scissor" switches and copies Apple's Magic Keyboard for desktops. After 24 hours, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-specs-pricing-hands-on-video/">Engadget Editor in Chief Dana Wollman writes "Yes, I like it. Quite a lot."</a></p>
      <p>The starting price has stayed the same as the 15-inch model it replaces at $2,399 for the entry-level configuration and $2,799 for the step-up model. It's slightly heavier at 4.3 pounds but also upgrades the battery inside from 84Wh to 100Wh -- the largest size allowed on planes. We'll need more time for a full review, but with a bigger screen, improved microphone and speakers and a physical escape button, things are looking up.</p>

      <p>Confirming the rumors we've heard all year, Motorola is rolling out a Verizon-exclusive $1,500 handset that folds up while reviving the classic RAZR in name and style. Now that Chris Velazco has checked out the device at Motorola's LA launch event, he said that while "people who demand peak smartphone performance or superior battery life might be a little disappointed... <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/motorola-razr-foldable-hands-on-preview-2019/">the company might be on to something.</a>"</p>
      <p>Amazingly, making a small device that unfolds into a regular-sized smartphone is more appealing to many than the Galaxy Fold approach of turning a phone into a tablet. The RAZR even has a few features that are usable while it's closed, and the motion of its hinge -- which relies on that sizable chin for support -- makes the phone satisfying to open. And when it's open, that 6.2-inch, 21:9 screen is ready to go. What we'll need to find out in our review is if its smallish dual-battery setup and midrange specs are too big of a sacrifice for the high price of flexibility.</p>

A spokesperson now says that the machine can handle six simultaneous 8K streams, up from the previous claim of three streams, made back when the machine was unveiled at WWDC in June.</p>
