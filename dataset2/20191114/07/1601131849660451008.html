      <h1>Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy A80 get November security update</h1>

      <p>The latest Android security patch is now available for two more Galaxy devices. The <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/november-2019-security-patch/">Galaxy Note 8</a> is receiving the November 2019 security patch update in Panama, while the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-a80/">Galaxy A80</a> is getting a similar update in Thailand. The software version for the Note 8 and A80 updates is <b>N950FXXS8DSK1</b> and <b>A805FXXS3ASK3</b> respectively.</p>
      <p>Samsung hasn’t bundled any new features or changes in these updates other than the November security patch. That’s normal for the Galaxy Note 8 as it has been on the market for more than two years and received two Android version updates. The Galaxy A80, on the other hand, was released only a few months ago, but it has also received mostly basic software updates since launch. It <i>will</i> gain <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/all-the-new-features-in-galaxy-s10-android-10-one-ui-2-0-beta/">new functionality</a> with the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/android-10-update">Android 10 update</a>, although there’s no ETA on when that update will start rolling out for the Galaxy A80 and other Galaxy devices.</p>
      <p>Galaxy Note 8 and A80 owners can download the latest update on their phone via the <i>Software update</i> menu in the Settings app by tapping the <i>Download and install</i> option. The latest firmware can also be found in our firmware database (<a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-note-8/firmware/SM-N950F/">Galaxy Note 8</a> | <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-a80/firmware/SM-A805F/">Galaxy A80</a>) and can be used to upgrade the device manually using a Windows PC.</p>
