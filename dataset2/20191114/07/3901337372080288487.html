      <p>Rushine de Reuck is a name that grows in reputation with every passing year, and the young centre back has explained what has led to Maritzburg United’s turnaround in fortunes.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old has been almost ever-present for the Team of Choice this season, starting all 10 of their Absa Premiership games and playing a vital role in their current seven-game unbeaten run across all competitions. </p>
      <p>With a third of the 2019/20 season gone, Maritzburg find themselves inside the top eight and into the final four of the Telkom Knockout after reaching the semifinals earlier this month, and it’s been an impressive few months for a club that narrowly avoided relegation back in June.</p>
      <p>But what’s the secret? “It’s hard work, pushing in the same direction and working as a unit,” he told the club’s official website. “We have been defending quite well this season and are able to create chances to score. And that is how we have been winning games.” </p>
      <p>Now, with the international break upon us, the defender is hoping his side can use the time to their advantage, adding, “We have been playing a lot of games recently. The guys are a bit fatigued and some injured. So we are going to use this time to rest and prepare for our next match against (Kaizer) Chiefs, so it’s good for us.”</p>

      <p>Eric Tinkler has all but one player – Richard Ofori – around for the international break, giving him time to work on combinations and plan for an Amakhosi side that also finds themselves in a rich vein of form. </p>
