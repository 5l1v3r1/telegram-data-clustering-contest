      <p>TOKYO, Nov 14 — Tokyo stocks closed lower today after the release of weaker-than-expected growth data in Japan and with ongoing doubts over a US-China trade deal.</p>
      <p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 0.76 per cent, or 178.32 points, to 23,141.55, while the broader Topix index was down 0.94 per cent, or 15.93 points, at 1,684.40.</p>
      <p>Investors faced a slew of negative news items — slack Japanese growth data, doubts over a US-China trade deal and a stronger yen — but none of them worrying enough to spark heavy selling.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to take drastic positions now in the absence of drastic news,” said Makoto Sengoku, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.</p>
      <p>“We are waiting for a good cue to move,” he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Japanese government data released early today showed the world’s third largest economy grew a much slower-than-expected 0.1 per cent in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>“The data wasn’t good but still in positive territory,” Sengoku noted.</p>
      <p>“If it had been decisively weak, it would have spawned hopes for a big stimulus package from the government. But it wasn’t the case this morning,” he said, adding investors needed to watch the retail sector after a hike in consumption tax in October.</p>
      <p>There are new signs that Washington and Beijing are not as close to signing a trade deal as investors had hoped but these are also “short of prompting investors to sell actively”, Sengoku said.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump last month announced a “phase one” deal had been agreed with China but efforts to commit the deal to paper appear to have hit roadblocks.</p>
      <p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported Chinese officials hesitated to agree formally to making gigantic purchases of American farm exports.</p>
      <p>The dollar was trading at ¥108.71 (RM4.16) in Asian afternoon trade against 108.84 yen in New York yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>In individual stocks trade, mobile operator SoftBank gained 1.89 per cent to ¥1,509 after media reports that its internet business is in final stages of talks on merging with popular messaging service LINE.</p>
      <p>The subsidiary, formerly Yahoo Japan and now called Z Holdings, said it was in talks with LINE but has not reached an agreement.</p>
      <p>LINE said integrating operations was one measure it was considering to increase its corporate value but nothing has been decided yet.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings surged 16.92 per cent to ¥449 and LINE jumped 15.37 per cent to ¥5,290 after trading was delayed with buy bids overwhelming sell offers. — AFP</p>
