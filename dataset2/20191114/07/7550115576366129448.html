      <p>As manager, he has coached his players, found a style which works and improved a whole host of stars, some of whom were barely even household names when he took over.</p>
      <p>But there’s much more to the club’s success than merely appointing the German, and Mourinho has spoken about how the Reds—and reigning <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> champions <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a>—have made moves to ensure they are the front runners throughout their entire hierarchy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/09/13/exclusive-jose-mourinho-interview-always-felt-alexis-sanchez/">Talking</a> to the <i>Telegraph</i>, the former <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-united">Man United</a> boss points to the notion of everyone pulling in the same direction as a big positive within Liverpool Football Club.</p>
      <p>Add an elite to coach to that environment, and the perfect storm has lifted the Reds to champions of Europe.</p>
      <p>“I think the structure of the clubs [make the difference],” he said.</p>

      <p>“When you look at City, for example: the owner, Ferran Soriano [chief executive], Txiki Begiristain [director of football], Pep Guardiola, Pep’s staff and then the players.</p>
      <p>“This looks like harmony, empathy, chemistry, quality, sharing the same project, sharing the same ideas.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool? I also think that Jurgen [Klopp] is in a good position. He is very stable. I think he has control of his ‘areas’. He is supported by people who think the same way, the structure of the club.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho further explained how, while Liverpool naturally benefit from having Klopp’s expertise in place, they are also ensuring themselves of a line of succession to keep challenging at the top.</p>

      <p>“Ok, Pep: fantastic coach. Jurgen: fantastic coach. I think if tomorrow one of them leaves and another top coach comes – of course he has to be top like they are – the team will still be there [at that level].</p>
      <p>“I think performance is globality. I think basically it is that.”</p>
      <p>While that structure and know-how throughout the club helps Liverpool, it isn’t the same at many other clubs.</p>
      <p>Even looking around the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> it’s easy to pick out the sides with disharmony or with everyone focused on the project plan: <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a>, or Leicester, for example.</p>
      <p>Looking beyond our own borders, the impressive nature of Liverpool’s set-up is further enhanced by the fact not many sides around the continent can claim to have similarly positive structures.</p>
      <p>And while Klopp is mutually enjoying Liverpool as much as we enjoy having him, Mourinho doesn’t think he’ll be enjoying the benefits of one such club any time soon.</p>

      <p>“You can count on your fingers the European clubs where you feel that everything is in place.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I am going to get one of these jobs. I think I am going to get one where probably they need my input, they need my experience, they need my knowledge before you build a winning team.”</p>
      <p>Klopp has been given the right environment to do exactly that: build a winning team.</p>
      <p>Then, it’s down to his coaching, his approach and his power to sway an entire fanbase, which has turned potential into silverware.</p>
