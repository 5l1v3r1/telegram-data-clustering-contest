        <b>Women should have the right to know what their male colleagues are being paid if they suspect pay discrimination, a gender equality charity has said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Fawcett Society is calling for a change in the law to try to cut down on instances of unequal pay.</p>
      <p>But men can help by simply telling female colleagues what they earn, the charity added.</p>
      <p>The call comes as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50412958">Labour pledges to close the gender pay gap by 2030</a>.</p>
      <p>Fawcett Society chief executive Sam Smethers said: "Pay secrecy means women cannot know if they are being paid equally and fairly.</p>
      <p>"Even if they do suspect a man is earning more it is almost impossible to do anything about it. This is why we are calling for a change in the law."</p>
      <p>She said that women need an enforceable "right to know" what their colleagues earn so that they can challenge unequal pay.</p>
      <p>"Men can help by simply telling their female colleagues what they earn. It really is that simple," Ms Smethers added.</p>
      <p>Shanti Kelemen, investor director at Brown Shipley, told BBC Radio 4's Programme that it should be "all or nothing".</p>
      <p>"I just think giving women the right isn't the answer. Why not minorities, old people, young people?"</p>
      <p>"If I was going to implement something like this, use a system like Sweden where anyone can look at anyone's tax return. The catch is that everyone will know you've looked."</p>
      <p>Under UK law, men and women are supposed to be paid the same for doing comparable work.</p>
      <p>The call from the Fawcett Society comes after the Labour Party pledged <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50412958">to close the gender pay gap by 2030 if it wins the election</a>.</p>
      <p>The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.</p>

      <h3>'I feel betrayed and disgusted'</h3>

      <p>Kay Collins had a job with a catering firm, but her work-life started to unravel after a chance conversation with a male colleague in September 2015.</p>
      <p>She found out that he was earning £6,000 more per year than her for doing exactly the same role as a chef.</p>
      <p>"I was shaking, I was so angry," she said.</p>
      <p>She was older and more experienced than her male colleague, and so raised a grievance with her female line manager.</p>
      <p>However, her manager said the man had more responsibilities - although he himself said he didn't.</p>
      <p>He ended up resigning, and Kay lost her job, although she won a settlement at a tribunal after a process that took many years.</p>
      <p>"It was an ordeal, that's what it was," she says. "I lost two stone over a couple of years [because of the stress]."</p>
      <p>However, the settlement was not enough to cover her £15,000 court costs.</p>
      <p>Kay, who is 60 next year, felt "down and betrayed" afterwards, and is now a full-time carer for her husband William, who has a heart condition, and is still having to work from home to pay their mortgage.</p>
      <p>"I feel disgusted and betrayed."</p>
