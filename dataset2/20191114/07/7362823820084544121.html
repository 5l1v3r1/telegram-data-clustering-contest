      <h1>Emmy-winning former medical correspondent allegedly asked girl, 9, for sexual photos</h1>

      <p>An Emmy-winning former medical <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">correspondent </a>for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">New York</a>'s local NBC stations was reportedly arrested Wednesday for allegedly asking a minor to send him sexually suggestive photos.</p>
      <p>Dr. Bruce Hensel allegedly requested the images from the daughter of an acquaintance through a messaging app in August, Deputy District Attorney Angela Brunson of the DA's Cyber Crimes Division said, according to The Los Angeles Times.</p>
      <p>Hensel was the chief on-air correspondent for NBC Los Angeles for 13 years starting in 1987. He also worked as a correspondent for KCOP-TV in Los Angeles.</p>

      <p>LAPD detectives with the Internet Crimes Against Children division launched a sexual exploitation investigation into Hensel months ago over photos allegedly shared between him and the 9-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>He was taken into custody at his Pacific Palisades home by Los Angeles Police Department officers around 10 a.m. Wednesday, a month after a search warrant was served at his house, the Times reported.</p>
      <p>Steve Sitkoff, his attorney, released the following statement to KABC: "Dr. Hensel is completely innocent of the charge. We are cooperating with the authorities and look forward to a speedy and complete exoneration."</p>
      <p>He faces one felony count of contact with a minor for sexual purposes. He was released on $5,000 bail Wednesday. He could face up to 18 months in prison if convicted.</p>
