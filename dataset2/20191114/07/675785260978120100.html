      <h2>The Three Lions are hopeful of securing qualification to Euro 2020 as they host Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday in their penultimate qualifying match</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:20:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> can seal their path to Euro 2020 with a win over Montenegro in the qualifying clash on Thursday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate's</a> side faced a difficult week during the last international break, after suffering a shock defeat to Czech Republic before becoming embroiled in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-bulgaria-vs-england-stadium-20579581">racism storm in Bulgaria</a> .</p>
      <p>They will be hopeful of a more positive result and experience all round at Wembley, against a Montenegro team who've collected just three points in the campaign so far.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions made light work of their opponents when facing them back in March, with a Ross Barkley brace helping them to a 5-1 win.</p>
      <p>And Southgate will no doubt be eager for his team to produce a similar effort in their penultimate qualifier.</p>
