      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14688"/>Rockstar has apologized for the problems PC gamers are experiencing with Red Dead Redemption 2. A new update that should be released quickly should solve the problems. Problems occurred with the combination of certain Nvidia cards, Nvidia drivers and processors.</p>
      <p>Last week two updates have been that should have solved the problem, however. Rockstar claims that a relatively small number of players still have to deal with the problems which are being worked on. Everybody will get a complimentary care package in the form of Prieto Poncho and an assortment of provisions and ammo. </p>
