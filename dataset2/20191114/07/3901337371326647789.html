      <p>With 28 trophies to his name as a manager, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in world football, and one of his former clubs is now reportedly interested in re-hiring him.</p>

      <p>Following City's 3-1 loss to Liverpool last weekend, which saw the Manchester club drop nine points behind the Reds in the Premier League, Guardiola has seemingly become a potential candidate to replace interim Bayern Munich boss Hans-Joachim Flick at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>German publication <i>Sport Bild</i> has reported that the Bavarians are considering a move for the Spaniard, who spent three years at Bayern between 2013 and 2016 before his venture into English football.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga giants are believed to have lined up a few possible long-term replacements for their current stand-in boss, and Guardiola is reportedly one of them.</p>

      <p>The 47-year-old tactician won seven trophies in his three years at Bayern, but those successes were overshadowed by the club's failure to win the coveted UEFA Champions League trophy in that period.</p>
      <p>Certain players were believed to not see eye to eye with Guardiola at the time too, which saw his exit from the Allianz Arena in 2016 welcomed by many in and around the German giants.</p>
      <p>The former FC Barcelona boss has had a successful stay at City thus far, but there seems to be a feeling this could be his last season in England, despite his current contract only expiring in 2021.</p>

      <p>It is, however, worth pointing out that Guardiola did say in June that he would not return to either of his former clubs.</p>
