      <h1>SoftBank talks tie-up with Line</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:18:43+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#josephwaring" target="_blank">Joseph Waring</a></address>
      <p>SoftBank Corp confirmed local reports stating it was in talks about a possible merger between its subsidiary Z Holdings, formerly Yahoo Japan, and mobile messaging platform operator Line.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued today (14 November), the Japanese mobile operator said while talks were ongoing, no decision had been made.</p>
      <p>Atul Goyal, equity analyst at Jefferies, commented in a research note a merger would benefit both companies, as the consolidation of Line (with 80 million active users) and Z Holding (50 million) would give them strong negotiating power with advertisers, and likely allow cross-selling opportunities.</p>
      <p>While there is fair bit of overlap, he noted the target market and demographic profile of the two companies is quite different.</p>
      <p>On the digital payment side, Goyal believes Softbank’s PayPay is extremely well positioned, so a merger would allow both companies to “stop bleeding, which will be particularly good for Line” and its parent Naver.</p>
      <p>Goyal added that a combined entity would have access to more data, allowing it to better target users for sales and strengthening its competitive position against Rakuten.</p>
      <p>With Rakuten in the process of becoming a <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/rakuten-mobile-postpones-launch/">full mobile operator</a> in Japan, SoftBank is expanding into retail, announcing recently Z Holdings will acquire online fashion retailer Zozo.</p>
