      <h1>GOP congressman's impeachment hearing tweets spell out 'Epstein didn't kill himself'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:41:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>On Wednesday, over the course of seven hours, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGosar">posted</a> 23 tweets, all pertaining to the public impeachment hearings going on over at the House Intelligence Committee. In reverse chronological order, the first words of each tweet were: "Evidence," "President," "Schiff," "The," "Every," "It's," "No," "Democrats," "It," "Donald," "Neither," "The," "Kent," "In," "Let," "Lying," "Hillary," "It's," "Maxine," "Schiff," "Even," "Let's," and "Finally." Taking the first letter of each of those words, you get: "Epstein didn't kill himself."</p>
      <p>Why would Gosar, a dentist by trade who is perhaps most famous for <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/797701/gop-representative-says-stalin-proud-siblings-opposing-campaign">six of his siblings opposing his last re-election bid</a>, take the time and effort to spell that out, acrostic-like, about Jeffrey Epstein's death while in federal prison? He didn't say. But he did seem pleased with his effort â€” and his joke.</p>
