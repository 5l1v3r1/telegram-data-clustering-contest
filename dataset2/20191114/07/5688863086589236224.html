        <b>Pakistan bowling coach Waqar Younis is extremely excited by the performance of the young Pakistan teenagers against Australia A . Imran Khan tormented the Australia A side with 5-32 in the first innings while 16-year-old Nasim Shah impressed in the second innings bowling a high-quality spell.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_amir">Mohammad Amir</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/wahab_riaz">Wahab Riaz</a> announced their retirement from Tests, Pakistan moved in the direction of youth by adding 19-year-old Musa Khan and 16-year old Nasim Shah in the Test squad along with the already impressive Shaheen Afridi. This young pace trio with the experience of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/imran_khan">Imran Khan</a> can cause huge problems to the Australian batsman and Younis reckons that they might be too hot to handle. Younis is extremely positive about the chances of the Pakistan team against Australia in the Test series especially due to the impressive performance of Pakistan teenagers. </p>
      <p>"Of course, that sort of performance (against Australia A) makes you feel that you're not naive being here and you can really do the job," he said in The Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper Thursday.</p>
      <p>The likes of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/usman_khawaja">Usman Khawaja</a>, Joe Burns, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/travis_head">Travis Head</a>, etc. have played Test cricket for Australia and troubling them is a good sign for the Pakistan bowling attack according to Younis.</p>
      <p>"All those batters have played for Australia or are knocking at the door. So getting them out early and bowling out the entire team cheaply will probably give us a very good message, that we are here for the business," he asserted.</p>
      <p>"We want to win and we want to challenge this Australian side, so there's definitely confidence," he further added.</p>
      <p>Pakistan were completely blown away in the T20 series as they suffered a 3-0 whitewash at the hands of Australia and thus coming back strongly in the Test format is what Younis hopes from the team. The first of the Two tests will be played in Brisbane which has traditionally been a fast track and offers help to the pace bowlers which is a positive sign for the Pakistan pace bowlers.</p>
      <p>But at the same time, the Pakistan batsman will have to apply themselves properly and see out the threat posed by <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mitchell_starc">Mitchell Starc</a>, Pat Cummins, etc. Younis believes that the team needs to play fearless cricket and needs to be positive in order to give a tough fight to the Australians in their own den.</p>
      <p>"I don't think Pakistan is worried about facing them or scared of any of them," he concluded.</p>
