      <p>Using the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard Free can seem like a cakewalk for both amateur and professional users who need to follow just these three steps for data recovery:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can store data in the partition, hard drive, eternal storage device or a specific file location like Documents, Desktops or Libraries. The info stored by you in these places might succumb to OS crashes, virus attacks, disk formatting, accidental data deletion or partition becoming RAW. In such a case, you will first have to select the location in which data loss happened.</li>
        <li>In the next step, your device gets examined through the dual modes of quick scan and deep scan. First comes quick scan which makes use of basic algorithm to search the specified files or folders and provide quick results. This is followed soon after by deep scan, which as the name implies scans every sector in the storage device for providing an in-depth analysis.</li>
        <li>Ultimately, you will have to recover the files which were lost previously. In this step, you can enjoy a preview of the files and select the ones which you actually require back in your system. Here the files can be filtered according to location and data type for preventing the recovery of unwanted data.</li>
      </ul>
