      <p>A former married couple have been found guilty of sexually abusing a 12-year-old Perth girl in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>It took a West Australian District Court jury less than three hours on Thursday to find Douglass Stephan Withnell guilty of having carnal knowledge of a girl and indecently dealing with a child.</p>
      <p>But they found his ex-wife Bethany Jayne Gilmore guilty only of the carnal knowledge offence and acquitted her of indecent dealing.</p>
      <p>The now 43-year-old victim, who cannot be named, cried as she testified during the trial detailing her abuse.</p>
      <p>She said when she was 12, she was taken to a dark bedroom where Withnell raped her on a bed, as Gilmore held her hand and told her to squeeze it if she was in pain.</p>
      <p>Withnell also inappropriately touched the victim during a separate incident.</p>
      <p>But the jury rejected her evidence that Gilmore inappropriately touched her during a bath when she was five.</p>
      <p>The court heard the former couple had previously been convicted of sexually abusing two of the victim’s sisters.</p>
      <p>Justice Joseph McGrath ordered psychological and pre-sentence reports for Gilmore and Withnell.</p>
      <p>He also ordered that they be remanded in custody until their sentencing hearing on February 17, saying he had concerns about granting them bail.</p>
      <p>“You have been convicted of serious offences,” Justice McGrath said.</p>
