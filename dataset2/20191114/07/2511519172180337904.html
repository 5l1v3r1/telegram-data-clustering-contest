      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kodak-black">Kodak Black</a> has been sentenced to more than three years in federal <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Prison">prison</a> after pleading guilty to weapons charges.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old rapper was handed a 46-month sentenced on Wednesday. He will also spend three years under supervised release.</p>
      <p>Black pleaded guilty in August to federal weapon charges. He was charged with falsifying information on federal forms to buy firearms from a Miami-area gun shop on two separate occasions.</p>
      <p>He was able to obtain three weapons: a 9 mm handgun, a .380-caliber handgun and a semi-automatic Mini Draco weapon. Authorities allege that one of the guns was found at the scene of a March shooting in Pompano Beach, although he has not been charged in that case.</p>
      <p>Black also faces drug, weapons and sexual assault charges in other states that remain pending. He has had several previous arrests.</p>
      <p>US District Judge Federico Moreno could have sentenced Black to the maximum of 10 years, and prosecutors wanted eight years in part because Black allegedly was involved in a jail fight that injured a corrections officer.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s time for us to give some tough love in this case,” said Assistant US Attorney Bruce Brown. “I just don’t see how and when he’s taken these things seriously.”</p>
      <p>But Moreno noted that Black has given money anonymously to charitable causes and could continue to do so behind bars.</p>
      <p>“My suggestion would be you continue to be generous,” the judge said.</p>
      <p>Black is a Florida native who was born to Haitian American parents as Dieuson Octave and who now goes by the legal name of Bill Kapri.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in May during the Rolling Loud hip-hop festival that was marred by several violent incidents, including an unrelated shooting at a seaside property owned by President Donald Trump. Black has remained in custody since then his arrest.</p>
      <p>“I have made some decisions I’m not proud of making,” Black said in court. “I do take full responsibility for my mishap.”</p>
      <p>Black’s better-known singles include “Skrt,” “Zeze”, “Roll in Peace”, “Tunnel Vision”, and “No Flockin.”</p>
