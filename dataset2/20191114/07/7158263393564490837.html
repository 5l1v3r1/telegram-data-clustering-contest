      <p>In case you haven’t been up to date on the new music cycle, please allow me to inform you that your favorite pop enigma Billie Eilish has a brand-new song out that is sure to break your fragile little heart—and no, that is not an exaggeration. Billie has been teasing the song, “Everything I Wanted,” for quite some time, and now, the song is finally here and it’s ready to leave you sobbing in a puddle of your own tears.</p>
      <p>Behind the song’s twinkling piano keys and wavering, melancholic synth instrumentals, Billie grapples with her sudden fame and opens up about a terrifying nightmare she had about committing suicide. Thankfully, it was just a dream, but it’s a painful reminder that Billie, despite her superstar status, is a human being who has her own personal experiences with mental health issues.</p>

      <p>[Verse 1]<b><br/>I had a dream<br/>I got everything I wanted<br/>Not what you’d think<br/>And if I’m bein’ honest<br/>It might’ve been a nightmare<br/>To anyone who might care</b></p>
      <p>You may not have noticed, but Billie has always had a very strong relationship with dreams and sleeping. Her debut album is literally called <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i>, so it kinda goes without saying that her dreams influence her music.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In an interview with <i><a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/05/billie-eilish-cover-story">The Fader</a></i>, Billie explained the role that her dreams play in her life. “Dreams are a really intense part of my life,” she said. “I’ll go through a month where I’ll have the same nightmare every single night—a dream that’s so bad that the whole day is off or a dream that’s so good that none of it’s true.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thought I could fly (fly)<br/>So I stepped off the Golden, mm<br/>Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)<br/>Nobody even noticed<br/>I saw them standing right there<br/>Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here, Billie starts delving into the contents of her nightmare and confesses to the listener that she “stepped off the Golden”—aka San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge—to commit suicide. And if that weren’t already terrible enough, everyone’s in Billie’s life, fans included, couldn’t have cared less that she decided to end her life.</p>
      <p>Billie spoke about the meaning of “Everything I Wanted” to BBC Radio 1’s Annie Mac and said:</p>
      <blockquote>“We [Billie and her brother, Finneas] started writing it because I literally had a dream that I killed myself and nobody cared and all of my best friends and people that I worked with basically came out in public and said, like, ‘Oh, we never liked her.’ In the dream, the fans didn’t care. The internet shit on me for killing myself, all this stuff, and it really did mess me up.”</blockquote>

      <p>[Pre-Chorus]<b><br/>I had a dream<br/>I got everything I wanted<br/>But when I wake up, I see<br/>You with me</b></p>
      <p>[Chorus]<b><br/>And you say, “As long as I’m here, no one can hurt you<br/>Don’t wanna lie here, but you can learn to<br/>If I could change the way that you see yourself<br/>You wouldn’t wonder why you’re here, they don’t deserve you”</b></p>

      </p>
      <p>This portion of the song relates to Billie’s close relationship with her brother, Finneas. In the lyrics, Finneas reassures Billie that he will always be there for her and will support her no matter what. “Pretty much that whole song is about me and Finneas’s relationship as siblings,” she told Annie Mac. “The message behind the song is, like...my brother is my best friend, and I have these dreams and these things happen, and no matter what happens, he’s gonna always be there for me, and it’s the same the other way around.”</p>
      <p>[Verse 2]<br/><b>I tried to scream<br/>But my head was underwater<br/>They called me weak<br/>Like I’m not just somebody’s daughter<br/>Coulda been a nightmare<br/>But it felt like they were right there<br/>And it feels like yesterday was a year ago<br/>But I don’t wanna let anybody know<br/>’Cause everybody wants something from me now<br/>And I don’t wanna let ’em down</b></p>
      <p>The second verse references her suicide nightmare but then begins to focus on the pressure that Billie experiences when it comes to fame, primarily keeping her fans happy and never wanting to let them down with her actions. It’s a heavy burden for a 17-year-old to bear, and Billie already has the world on her shoulders.</p>
      <p>In conclusion: Billie Eilish struggles with feelings of isolation and depression, much like we all do. But the silver lining here is that she has her big brother by her side to help her out when times are tough. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be listening to this track on repeat and wallowing in my feels for the rest of the day.</p>
