      <h1>India seek much-needed win in tough conditions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:24:13+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Marcus-Mergulhao-479195787.cms" target="_blank">Marcus Mergulhao</a></address>
      <p>On a cold Wednesday morning when Igor Stimac reached cold Dushanbe with the Indian team, he stopped to check what he was left with. There wasn't much, particularly in central defence, ahead of the crucial <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/FIFA-World-Cup">Fifa World Cup</a> 2022 qualifier against Afghanistan.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sandesh-Jhingan">Sandesh Jhingan</a> has undergone surgery for a partial ACL tear and is recuperating in Mumbai. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anas-Edathodika">Anas Edathodika</a> has returned home following the passing away of his mother, and although Adil Khan travelled with the team, he hasn't trained for more than a week. That leaves the coach with Narender Gahlot as the only recognised centre-back. Of course, there is <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rahul-Bheke">Rahul Bheke</a> and Subhashish Bose as options in central defence, but they are more comfortable playing elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"I have to count on the options that are available to me. I see this as an opportunity for the other players to grab this chance," Stimac told TOI from the Tajikistan capital.</p>

      <p>India's defence will be under scrutiny when they take on Afghanistan in the first of their two consecutive away matches. The cold - approximately five degrees when match kicks off at 7.30pm IST - and the artificial turf will pose additional problems, but the lack of options could hurt more. "We have to remain focused and overcome the odds. We faced a similar situation prior to the Qatar game and managed to put up a brave front. All this makes us stronger," said Stimac, whose side has two points from the first three matches.</p>
      <p>After dropping points against Bangladesh at home, India find themselves in a delicate situation against Afghanistan. The former SAFF champions have opted to play their home matches in Tajikistan due to security concerns in their country, and although they have conceded nine goals in three matches, they are placed above India, thanks to a solitary goal win against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>"Afghanistan will be tough opponents. They are a physical side and have a good bunch of players. There are about six players who play in Europe, not in the top league, but even in a second division (in Europe), there is more quality," said Stimac.</p>
      <p>No player embodies the Afghanistan spirit more than <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Farshad-Noor">Farshad Noor</a>, who represented Netherlands at the junior level and scored the winner against Bangladesh. The captain is one of the most high-profile player in the squad, having graduated from Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven's youth system, made it to their senior team and then moved to Nea Salamis in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>"We would have been happier if we could play in our own country, but playing here gives us confidence. We have beaten Cambodia, Bangladesh here and settled for a draw against Tajikistan, Jordan," said coach Anoush Dastagir.</p>
