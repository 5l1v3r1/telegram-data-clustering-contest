      <p>NOBODY should be spending Christmas Day alone, according to Joondalup Christmas Lunch organisers.</p>
      <p>“Whether it be through financial hardship or simply not having any family and friends to celebrate the occasion with, December 25 can be one of the most difficult days of the year for many,” grants coordinator Margaret Fullelove said.</p>
      <p>“That is why we are encouraging anyone who would otherwise be spending Christmas Day alone to attend the 2019 Joondalup Christmas Lunch at Central Park.”</p>
      <p>Organised by local churches and volunteers, the lunch is now in its 12th year and has grown to become one of the biggest events of its kind in Perth.</p>

      <p>“This annual celebration gives people an opportunity to enjoy a delicious Christmas meal and make some new friends along the way, as well as show that what a caring community looks like,” Mrs Fullelove said.</p>
      <p>The lunch will run from 11.30am to 2.30pm on December 25 and aims to cater for 500 guests.</p>
