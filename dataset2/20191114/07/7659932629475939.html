      <p>Saudi Arabia continues to take qualitative steps towards securing international corridors and freedom of maritime navigation.<br/><br/>The Royal Saudi Naval Forces is expected to organize the Saudi International Maritime Patrol Ships Forum on November 24-26 in Riyadh along with Saudi efforts to maintain the corridors’ security and safety.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia aims to ensure the freedom of international maritime traffic in the straits and strategic corridors and to enhance maritime security in sea lanes and transport lines, said Brig. Gen. Faisal Bin Muhammad Al-Ghamaisi, Chairman of the Forum, in a speech during a press conference held on Wednesday at the headquarters of the Saudi Royal Navy in Riyadh.<br/><br/>On the importance of the conference in addressing security challenges facing maritime navigation, Ghamaisi told Asharq Al-Awsat: “The forum will discuss with particular interest maritime security.”<br/><br/>He added that experts would analyze those challenges and discuss the means to resolve them.<br/><br/>“It is known that challenges and threats remain, and work should focus on how to deal with them before they occur,” he added.<br/><br/>The US-led naval military coalition in Bahrain last week officially launched its mission to protect shipping in the Gulf region from attacks primarily blamed on Iran.<br/><br/>Around four months ago, Washington launched the initiative to form the International Alliance for the Safety and Protection of Maritime Navigation and the Safety of Maritime Corridors.<br/><br/>The alliance includes, in addition to the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Britain, Australia and Albania.<br/><br/>Ghamaisi said that the forum would discuss five main issues dealing with all aspects of securing strategic sea lanes, adding that an exhibition would be held in parallel, where local and international companies would showcase latest equipment, technologies and systems in the field of maritime security.</p>
