      <h1>'P.S. we owe you some milk:' Australian firefighters leave note after saving man's house</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:43:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:43</time> by <a rel="author">Gianluca Mezzofiore and Jack Guy, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Firefighters in <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/12/australia/fires-australia-sydney-intl-hnk/index.html">Australia</a> have been battling some of the worst bushfires in decades -- but one crew still remembered its manners.</p>
      <p>When homeowner Paul Sekfy returned to his property he found it damaged but still intact, thanks to the firefighters.</p>
      <p>Inside the house he found a note from the Urunga Rural Fire Service.</p>
      <p>"It was our pleasure to save your house. Sorry that we could not save your sheds," it read. "P.S. we owe you some milk."</p>
      <p>Kale Hardie-Porter was part of a team sent to an area near Macksville, <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/11/10/australia/bushfires-australia-intl-hnk/index.html">New South Wales</a>, to fight fires in what he described to CNN as "horrendous conditions."</p>
      <p>They came across a house and made a decision to try to save it, despite facing "smoke and heat you can't imagine."</p>
      <p>Two sheds were lost to the flames, and the firefighters were faced with a decision on what to do next.</p>
      <p>"It became clear it was a matter of saving the house as best as we can and saving our truck as well," said Hardie-Porter.</p>
      <p>Not knowing whether the house would survive, Hardie-Porter told CNN the team opened the fridge and took some milk as they hadn't eaten or drunk anything since midday.</p>
      <p>After the fire passed the firefighters were able to leave the area, and Hardie-Porter decided to leave a note in case the house survived and the owner could get in touch.</p>
      <p>Sekfy was struck by the note and posted a picture of it online.</p>
      <p>He told CNN that the firefighters also ate some cheese and peanut butter, but he doesn't mind.</p>
      <p>"They don't have to pay back the milk, I'll just sort them a couple of cases of beer," said Sekfy, who told CNN he is now living in a motel as his house is uninhabitable.</p>
      <p>"I lost two sheds and everything else, pumps, machinery, tools and my mountain bike for example."</p>
      <p>Australian authorities say there are reports of property damage and injuries throughout New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, but have not confirmed the exact extent.</p>
