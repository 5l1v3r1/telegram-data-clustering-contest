      <p>He’s regularly spoken about as one of the most talented players South Africa has ever produced, and now Masibusane Zongo has got another chance to set things right…</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old attacker, who is famed for his dribbling ability, has had plenty of off-the-field drama that has hindered his progress as a professional footballer, and he seems to be a long way from the bright-eyed youngster that burst onto the scene at SuperSport United.</p>
      <p>After things didn’t work out at clubs like Platinum Stars, Royal Eagles and Extension Gunners in Botswana, it seemed as though Zongo had finally had his last chance in the game, but now he’s been given one more by a side in the ABC Motsepe League in the Free State.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed on Tuesday night that the former Matsatsantsa star had penned a contract to play for D’General FC where he will be hoping to start enjoying his football once again as they push to try and climb up into the GladAfrica Championship in the not-so-distant future.</p>
      <p>The club said on their official Facebook page, “This has been a very well-kept secret... D'General FC is proud of the acquisition of Masibusane Zongo and he is now part of the family... WELCOME HOME BOY!!!!”</p>

      <p>Zongo is due to start training at his new club next week after sealing a deal in South Africa’s third tier, and will be looking forward to earning himself a place in the XI in what is surely his last chance to showcase his undoubted talent in a competitive environment.  </p>
