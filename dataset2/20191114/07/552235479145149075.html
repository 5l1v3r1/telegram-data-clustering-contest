      <h1>Rangers legend Ally McCoist breaks silence on bombshell HMRC claims</h1>
      <h2>McCoist was manager when Rangers suffered their financial collapse and insists the taxman must explain what happened.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T07:47:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 07:47</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Ally McCoist insists HMRC have serious questions to answer over the alleged mistake that led to the downfall of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers.</a></p>
      <p>A report in <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/">The Times</a> claims the taxman overcharged Rangers to the tune of £50m for their use of EBTs.</p>
      <p>And it's believed that the revised figure would have been easily dealt with by the old company and resulted in administration and liquidation being avoided.</p>
      <p>That led to Rangers being out of the top flight of Scottish football for four years as they made their way back in from Division Three.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ally-mccoist">McCoist</a> was Rangers manager at the time of the collapse and told talkSPORT: "I have to say if this is the case, and I know HMRC haven't commented this morning but I imagine serious questions will have to be answered."</p>
      <p>The Ibrox legend was also quizzed by host Alan Brazil on whether he would receive any money from the taxman as he teased: "Have you got a few quid coming back? Off to Dubai?"</p>
      <p>McCoist joked: "I doubt it, I think I've kissed that goodbye."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>According to the report in The Times, accountancy experts now believe the amount owed by the club stood at £20m, a figure it has been suggested was more manageable and one that would not have triggered administration.</p>
      <p>The report centres around the use of EBTs during Sir <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/david-murray">David Murray's</a> tenure as chairman of the club. The tax avoidance scheme eventually led to Murray selling the club to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-whyte">Craig Whyte</a> for just £1 before the financial collapse.</p>
      <p>Former Rangers chairman John McClelland, as quoted in the report, believes the nightmarish outcome would not have befallen the club had the tax bill been smaller.</p>
      <p>He said: "At the time of the sale of the club in 2011, had the tax claim been at the level now being reported then in my opinion, the outcome would have been different.</p>
      <p>"I believe there would have certainly been a much higher level of interest of acquiring it and therefore more potential buyers."</p>
