      <h1>Robert Pattinson Explains Why He Became The Batman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:22:16+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:22</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Warner Bros. made waves earlier this year when it <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/451247-its-official-robert-pattinson-is-the-batman">officially cast <b>Twilight</b>’s Robert Pattinson</a> as <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a>. Despite trepidation from some fans, Pattinson is still ready to put everything he has into the role for Matt Reeves’ upcoming film.</p>
      <p>Recently, Pattinson appeared on a video interview with actress Jennifer Lopez, as part of <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/actors/jennifer-lopez-robert-pattinson-batman-hustlers-the-lighthouse-1203402753/">Variety</a>’s <b>Variety Studio: Actors on Actors</b>. They discussed a number of topics, and Lopez eventually asked Pattinson why he wanted to portray Batman.</p>
      <p>“With <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/batman"><b>Batman</b></a><b>,</b> there was something — I was very focused on it. It kept coming back into my head,” explained Pattinson.</p>
      <p>Pattinson told Lopez  that he didn’t directly seek it out, but he felt the need to win the role.</p>
      <p>“I was interested in it,” said Pattinson. “I don’t know what it is, which happened inside of me, but I was like, ‘I kind of want to do it.’ I like doing something which an audience doesn’t know that it wants, and try to get it out of them: ‘Oh, yeah, you want to play Batman.’”</p>

      <p>According to Pattinson, he still can’t believe he was cast as the Dark Knight.</p>
      <p>“Whenever I see that little action figure, I still haven’t really got my head around it yet,” admitted Pattinson.</p>
      <p><b>The Batman</b> will hit theaters on June 25, 2021.</p>
