      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/country">The iconic country singer</a>, who served as a co-host of the CMAs along with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/carrie-underwood">Carrie Underwood</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/dolly-parton">Dolly Parton</a>, took to the stage Wednesday night to perform her hit "Fancy," and she surprised the audience with three separate outfit changes during the performance.</p>
      <p>When the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">song</a> began, McEntire, 64, was wearing a silky purple robe with white feathered cuffs, but moments later she shed the robe to reveal a stunning bright red dress.</p>
