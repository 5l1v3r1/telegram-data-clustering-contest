      <h1>Texas family told to take down Christmas decorations 'until closer to the holiday season'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:46:20+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:46</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Miles</a></address>
      <p>Claudia Simonis is eight months pregnant and wanted to put up her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Christmas</a> decorations early this year. They include a snowman, some reindeer and a Santa hanging from a helicopter.</p>
      <p>"I feel kind of heavy, so the earlier we can put out the decorations, the better," Claudia told San Antonio's <a href="https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/too-soon-festive-family-told-to-take-down-christmas-decorations">WOAI</a>. "Because probably in two more weeks, I'm not going to be able to build all this."</p>
      <p>But now she’s in trouble with her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> neighborhood's homeowners association.</p>

      <p>On Nov. 1, the Simonis home in the Lakeside at Canyon Springs subdivision in San Antonio was decorated. Three days later, the family received a letter from Diamond Association Management &amp; Consulting informing them of the violation of their rules.</p>
      <p>“Maintenance – Holiday Decorations Need To Be Removed,” the notice read. Under a section labeled "inspector notes," DAMC asked the family to "please remove the snowman until closer to the holiday season."</p>
      <p>Now the family is protesting.</p>
      <p>"I just found it crazy," said Claudia. "Especially that they didn’t give us a time. Like, when is the right time to put it?"</p>

      <p>Other neighbors are joining their fight.</p>
      <p>"I don't think this should be an issue," added neighbor Charles Minton, who's already put some penguins and a large Merry Christmas ornament in his front yard. "These are the holidays. This is what we do."</p>
      <p>DAMC did not return Fox News’ email for comment Wednesday night. Meanwhile, the Simonis family decorations are staying up, at least for now.</p>
      <p>"We're not going to do it [take them down]," said Claudia's husband, Nick Simonis. "It's the Christmas spirit. We're not going to be forced by the HOA to take it down."</p>
