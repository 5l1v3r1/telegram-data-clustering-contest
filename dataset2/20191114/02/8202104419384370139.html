      <p>For all the folks not yet ready for the Christmas music onslaught, here are some concerts that should be decidedly non-Christmasy for you</p>
      <h4>It might as well be mid-December instead of mid-November, <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/music/1206-you-carols">with all the holiday music that’s already been floating around.</a></h4>
      <p>To be honest, I don’t mind it at all. This is one of the best times of the year, hands down, even with the questionable quality of the weather — but I know there are folks who think it’s a little too early to break out the Michael Bublé Christmas album and a glass of egg nog.</p>
      <p>For those people, here are some concerts that should be decidedly non-Christmasy. Enjoy them while you can — that tide will turn soon enough.</p>
      <h3>Altameda</h3>
      <p><b>When:</b> Friday, Nov. 15</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> Amigos Cantina</p>
      <p><b>What: </b>Altameda — a four-person new-age rock band based out of Edmonton — brims with nostalgia even as it tries some new things with the music. The band’s tunes are very grandiose in sound, but not viciously hitting. It’s a broad, beautiful sound that combines deeply emotional lyrics and sweeping melodies with some very bluesy drums and guitar riffs. It does not have that classic rock sort of heaviness to it — and that is absolutely to Altameda’s credit, not their detriment. The vocals are slick, the music is firmly in a cool new-old style, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a great Canadian package.</p>

      <h3>David Gogo</h3>
      <p><b>When:</b> Saturday, Nov. 16</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> Black Cat Tavern</p>
      <p><b>What: </b>I usually expect the Black Cat Tavern to be a bastion of heavy metal, hard rock, and the occasional hip-hop show — so colour me pleasantly surprised to see someone who could only be described as a blues aficionado set to take the stage. David Gogo, a six-time Juno Award nominee and a regular staple of the Maple Blues Awards in Canada, is an absolutely top-notch blues guitarist and singer. It’s big and powerful, dipping a toe into the rock and roll pool while creating some of the best blues guitar riffs imaginable. Also, he’s got a great name for performing, which means this has to be one of the concerts of the week.</p>
      <h3>Old Man Luedecke</h3>
      <p><b>When:</b> Sunday, Nov. 17</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> The Bassment</p>
      <p><b>What: </b>All across Canada, we get the best kinds of talent. Old Man Luedecke, real name Christopher Luedecke, is no exception. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/music/at-home-with-music-old-man-luedecke-explores-domestic-on-new-album">The Juno Award-winning artist from Nova Scotia</a> is a brilliant folk musician whose cross-Canada travels have helped inform his style. Luedecke’s deep, calm vocal stylings perfectly accent a relaxed acoustic musical style. Most interesting might be that Luedecke’s banjo-heavy tunes don’t carry the Atlantic Canada-folk style that permeates most of that region’s music. There are elements here and there, but it’s not overpowering. Luedecke’s really feels like a broad-reaching, broadly-appealing brand of folk music.</p>
