      <p>There were only 252 units over built, so that makes them some of the most special cars in the world. The classic cars in questions are the BMW 507 Roadsters which are the darling of the auction world. Earlier this year, a 1958 BMW 507 Roadster sold for $2.175 million at the RM Sotheby’s in Arizona.</p>
      <p>Next February, another 1958 BMW 507 goes up for auctioning at the <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/pa20/paris/lots/r0026-1958-bmw-507-roadster-series-ii/830799">RM Sotheby’s in Paris</a>. This time, the car is expected to fetch between €1.7 million and €2 million (US$1.9 million and US$2.2 million). The auction house will offer a selection of 21 iconic and desirable motor cars, dubbed <i>The Poster Car Collection</i> as they were wall posters for car enthusiasts.</p>

      <p>RM Sotheby’s Paris auction will be held at the historic Place Vauban.</p>
      <p>The BMW 507 Roadster was designed by Count Albrecht Goertz, a young German designer then living in New York and later responsible for another beautiful car, the Datsun 240 Z-series. A production-ready 507 was also unveiled at New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel in 1955 and its design has impressed everyone in the attendance.</p>
      <p>The most famous of all was the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2016/08/04/bmw-507-driven-elvis-presley-makes-comeback/">BMW 507 owned by Elvis Presley</a>.</p>
      <p>Under the hood it featured a new 3.2 liter V8 engine with Zenith dual-barrel carburetors, producing 148 horsepower. A four speed transmission would send power to the rear wheels. The 0 to 60 mph sprint was recorded at around 10 seconds while the top speed was limited to 136 mph.</p>
      <p>An impressive automobile for the 1950s.</p>
