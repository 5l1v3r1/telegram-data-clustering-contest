      <h1>WA moves to improve racehorse welfare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:26:43+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:26</time> by <a rel="author">AAP</a></address>
      <p>MOVES are underway to improve welfare standards for racehorses in Western Australia, including creating a “passport” for each animal to track them after retirement, and subjecting knackeries and abattoirs to random inspections.</p>
      <p>The state government announced on Thursday a new ‘rule of racing’ whereby the industry must aim to rehome all healthy and behaviourally sound thoroughbreds and standardbreds.</p>
      <p>Racing and Gaming Minister Paul Papalia said the federal government would be pressured to implement and oversee a National Traceability Register, which was essential to restore confidence in the industry in the wake of the recent scandal surrounding the Meramist Abattoir in Queensland.</p>
      <p>“Racing and Wagering Western Australia (RWWA) in collaboration with the State Government has developed a robust welfare plan that incorporates all stages of a racehorse’s life through a program of investment, education, monitoring and regulation.</p>
      <p>“Western Australia is leading the nation on racehorse welfare. We are doing more than any other State to look after our racehorses.</p>
      <p>“I applaud the industry for getting behind the plan of action and ensuring our racehorses receive the best treatment from birth to death.</p>
      <p>“I now call on the Commonwealth Government to play its part and implement and oversee a National Traceability Register as a priority.”</p>
