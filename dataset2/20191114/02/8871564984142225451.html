      <h1>Singapore court hears new challenges to gay sex ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:25:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>New challenges to a law banning gay sex were put before a Singapore court on Wednesday, the latest bid to overturn the statute and score another victory for LGBT rights in Asia.</p>
      <p>Inherited from the British colonial era, the law is rarely enforced but campaigners say it nevertheless jars with the affluent city-state’s increasingly modern and vibrant culture.</p>
      <p>Still, opponents argue that Singapore remains at heart conservative and is not ready for change while officials also believe most would not be in favor of repealing the legislation.</p>
      <p>A first attempt to overturn it was rejected in 2014 but now three people — a retired doctor, a DJ, and an LGBT rights advocate — have lodged fresh challenges aiming to prove the law is unconstitutional.</p>
      <p>Lawyers representing the plaintiffs confirmed the civil suits had started behind closed doors at the High Court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The three challenges will be heard one after another until Nov. 22, and the judge will make a ruling at a later date.</p>
      <p>“I think we have strong points and we are hopeful,” Eugene Thuraisingam, a lawyer for DJ Johnson Ong, told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>The retired doctor challenging the statute, 61-year-old Roy Tan, has criticized the “anachronistic law” — Section 377A of the penal code — for adversely affecting the lives of gay men.</p>
      <p>“By institutionalizing discrimination, it alienates them from having a sense of belonging and purposeful place in our society, and prevents them from taking pride in Singapore’s achievements,” he said in a statement when he announced his intention to challenge the law.</p>
      <p>If the legislation is overturned, it will mark another step forward for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in the region.</p>
      <p>Last year, India’s Supreme Court decriminalized gay sex by overturning legislation from its own period under British rule — a decision that spurred campaigners in Singapore to renew their efforts to challenge Section 377A.</p>
      <p>And in Taiwan, lawmakers took the unprecedented decision in May to legalize same-sex marriage, becoming the first place in Asia to do so. Over 2,000 couples have since wed on the island.</p>
      <p>Singapore’s ban, first introduced in 1938 by British colonial administrators, carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail for homosexual acts.</p>
