      <h1>Liverpool and Man Utd transfer target Jadon Sancho 'to leave Borussia Dortmund'</h1>
      <h2>England ace Sancho has reportedly decided his future lies away from the Bundesliga with Liverpool, Man Utd and Real Madrid set for transfer battle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:56:04+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:56</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Jadon Sancho has reportedly decided to leave Borussia Dortmund amid interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Sancho is set to take Raheem Sterling's place in the England team for Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifying clash against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The Borussia Dortmund winger is a long-time target for Manchester United, while Liverpool are the latest club to have been linked with a swoop for the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>And now it has emerged Sancho is ready to leave Dortmund after an unhappy few weeks at the Bundesliga club.</p>
      <p>That's according to a report from the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7682459/Jadon-Sancho-hands-major-boost-suitors-English-winger-wants-LEAVE-Borussia-Dortmund.html">Mail</a> , which says the former Manchester City talent has been left unsettled by developments this season.</p>

      <p>The report says Dortmund have already begun preparations to sign his replacement as they prepare for a Â£100million transfer battle.</p>
      <p>Sancho became a key player for Dortmund since leaving City for the Bundesliga club in 2017 search of first-team football.</p>
      <p>But this season has not been going so well for him. He has not found the target since netting at Eintracht Frankfurt for his club on September 22 - having netted six before that, including two for England against Kosovo in September.</p>
      <p>Sancho was left out of his club's squad for their 1-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach last month having returned late from international duty with England.</p>

      <p>He was then hauled off after just 36 minutes of his side's 4-0 defeat to rivals Bayern Munich at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Now either Liverpool or United could be about to capitalise on Sancho's problems in Germany.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are looking to add more strength in depth to their array of attacking talent in case of injuries to the likes of Mo Salah and Sadio Mane, as they target a first top-flight title in 30 years and the defence of their Champions League crown.</p>
      <p>United also need to strengthen their attack, having had to rely on 21-year-old summer signing Daniel James and 17-year-old Mason Greenwood more than they would have expected to following injuries to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.</p>
      <p>Both Liverpool and United face competition from clubs across Europe, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in particular interested in signing Sancho.</p>
