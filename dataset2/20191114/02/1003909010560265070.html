      <h1>'In the middle of the ocean': Shisha lounges left in limbo by city</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:07:38+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:07</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>A local business owner says he’s been left in limbo by the city after a council committee voted against an outright ban on shisha smoking in public and in workplaces, while leaving the door open to prohibition at a future date.</p>
      <p>Committee members voted Wednesday to delay making a decision about restricting hookah or shisha smoking until the province issues its own legislation next spring.</p>
      <p>“You’re still in the middle of the ocean, you don’t know where you’re going to go,” said Odai Alghebari, who operates a shisha lounge called Cafe Med. “You don’t know if you’re going to go right or left. They haven’t given us a final decision, so it is a little bit tough.”</p>
      <p>Alghebari said compounding his frustration is the fact he spent $300,000 installing upgraded ventilation at his new business in June to satisfy provincial health and safety standards.</p>
      <p>“It’s scary because (you) put all your money, all your fortune into one thing (and) worked your butt off for one entire year and now you know that the city is just going to put an end to it,” Alghebari said following Wednesday’s public hearing. “Why do you go make me pay $300,000? Why did you make us go renovate our other (business) if you’re just going to go shut us down after a year and a half?”</p>

      <p>Committee members also heard from several health experts Wednesday about the dangers of shisha smoking and second-hand smoke exposure to public health. City staff said they were particularly concerned about workers exposed to second-hand smoke in shisha lounges who may be unaware of the long-term health effects.</p>
      <p>City staff recommended that council amend the municipal bylaw to expand the current restrictions around tobacco consumption to include water pipe or shisha smoking. The city recommended a start date of July 1, 2021, for the new rules to give business owners more time to “phase out” shisha products.</p>
      <p>There could be as many as 40 businesses offering shisha that could be affected by the proposed restrictions. City staff acknowledged Wednesday that “several” of those businesses have already installed upgraded ventilation units to meet provincial building code requirements for air exchange in smoking rooms.</p>
      <p>Alghebari was the only business owner to speak at Wednesday’s public hearing, though a petition was submitted to the city on behalf of other shisha lounge supporters.</p>
      <p>“We always try to put hurdles for you guys. We shouldn’t be doing that,” Coun. Joe Magliocca said at Wednesday’s hearing. “If you want to be open for business and you’ve got a sign up there that says 18 and over — you should be entitled to it.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot more things that can kill you.”</p>
      <p>Coun. Evan Woolley also argued against prohibition and suggested that businesses were being treated unfairly.</p>
      <p>“I struggle to rationalize how we go to all these shisha bar businesses and we ask them to make investments in public health in their businesses and now we’re going to close them down,” said Woolley. “I find that to be deeply unfair.”</p>
      <p>Woolley also compared the harm done by shisha to alcohol, and suggested the city was unfairly targeting a “niche” product, frequently consumed by minority cultural communities, while continuing to tolerate the much broader harms from alcohol.</p>
      <p>Alghebari, who told committee members Wednesday that he comes from Jordan, said a prohibition would amount to “killing” his culture and social life.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people that come to our establishments, it’s because they don’t really drink alcohol, so they have a different type of social life,” Alghebari said. “A lot of people go out for drinks so they can meet up with people, have fun, gathering, whatever. (For) us, it’s more like you go smoke shisha, you have dinner, you play cards — same type of concept.”</p>
      <p>Council as a whole will vote on the matter at a future meeting.</p>
