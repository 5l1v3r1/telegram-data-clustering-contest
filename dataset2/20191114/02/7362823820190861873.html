      <h1>Jessie James Decker wows in satin black dress at 2019 CMAs with husband Eric Decker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:11:03+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:11</time> by <a rel="author">Julius Young</a></address>
      <p>It didn’t take much for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jessie-james-decker">Jessie James Decker</a> to turn heads at the 2019 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/cma-awards">CMAs</a>.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/country">country</a> singer dazzled on the red carpet in a simple yet elegant spaghetti strap black dress with a high slit. The reality star kept it clean with black strappy heels and had her blonde hair pulled back into a messy bun.</p>
      <p>Decker’s husband, Eric Decker, accompanied his wife to country music's biggest night. The former NFL tight end, 32, opted for black slacks, and a wool black-and-gray blazer paired with a gray T-shirt and gray low-top sneakers.</p>

      <p>“[Eric’s] retired now, so we can be spontaneous,” she told <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jessie-james-decker-on-being-intimate-with-husband-eric-hes-retired-now-so-we-can-be-spontaneous">Fox News in February</a>.</p>
      <p>And although the couple has their hands full with three little ones --  4-year-old daughter Vivianne, 3-year-old son Eric Jr. and son Forrest, 1 -- when it comes to having a fourth baby, the singer isn’t counting another baby out.</p>

      <p>“I would say never say never,” she said. “We’re not against it and we’re not planning it either. I think if it were to happen naturally, another baby is always a blessing, but as of right now we are very happy with baby Forrest.”</p>
