      <h2>Angela Causer blasted Prime Minister Boris Johnson for coming to Stainforth in South Yorkshire days after the town was hit by devastating floods he decided were not a national emergency</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:29:18+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:29</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Thornton, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lucy-thornton/</a></address>
      <p>Furious locals in a flood-hit part of Britain yesterday turned their anger on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> as he finally made an appearance in their devastated town.</p>
      <p>The PM faced a barrage of ­criticism during a tour of ­Stainforth, South Yorks, almost a week after it was deluged, forcing hundreds of residents to flee.</p>
      <p>Locals tore into Tory ­promises of cash aid after insisting recent pledges have come to nothing.</p>
      <p>While some let their feelings be known to embarrassed Mr Johnson, others snubbed him as he tried in vain to engage them in conversation.</p>
      <p>The PM, who still refused to declare <br/>a national emergency over the floods, was watching some of the 100 troops <br/>he sent in, when one local yelled: “You took your time Boris.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “You’ve not helped us … I don’t know what you’re here today for.”</p>

      <p>Cleaner Billie Troops, 39, asked him in a community centre: “Boris, why has it taken you five days to come here?”</p>
      <p>Questioning the PM’s pledge of cash aid, she added: “Is that a promise though? Because you promised us months ago that you were going to give our community £25million to make the community better, for town funds. We’re still waiting for it, Boris.”</p>
      <p>The PM was then asked: “Is that a lie again?”</p>
      <p>Resident Pat Knight, 60, refused to shake Mr Johnson’s hand and asked: “Why did it take you five days to come north of the Watford Gap?”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Cleaner Shelly Beniston, told him how they had been “crying out for help” but it had come “too late”.</p>
      <p>Local <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> councillor Sue Durant berated the PM for his delay in visiting.</p>
      <p>She told him: “People have lost their possessions and it has taken you over five days. You should have been there Saturday morning.”</p>
      <p>Angela Causer, whose home was ravaged by Friday’s flood, was helping the Army move sandbags when she saw Mr Johnson, and ignored his offer to chat.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old Prison Service worker said later: “He’s an annoying little man who didn’t even get his wellies wet. I was going to vote for him until he said it wasn’t a national ­emergency. It might not be for him but it’s devastating for us.”</p>
      <p>Around 500 homes have been flooded and 1,200 properties ­evacuated in the South Yorkshire region. Many houses are uninsured because of previous flooding.</p>

      <p>Residents are living in fear of a second wave of flooding after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> warned of a possible storm today with up to 60mm rainfall.</p>
      <p>The nearby village of Fishlake has been deluged by the floods that also left farms in Lincolnshire cut off.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson could find no haven from the angry locals in his official car. Volunteers plonked cleaning products on his lap.</p>
      <p>One told him: “Are you going to Fishlake, are you going to take some supplies with you?”</p>
      <p>Locals in flooded Bentley, six miles from Stainforth, told of their fury at Mr Johnson, even though he never visited them.</p>
      <p>Gwen Kincel, 69, said: “What the hell do we need him for?</p>

      <p>“He hasn’t done anything for us. It’s a good job he didn’t come because I would have said, ‘Get on your bike.’”</p>
      <p>The PM promised relief funding of £500 for each affected home and up to £2,500 for small ­businesses.</p>
      <p>But he refused to apologise to those devastated by the flooding. Mr Johnson said: “I made clear that the Government stands ready to support in any way we can.”</p>
      <p>He defended the five days it had taken him to visit Yorkshire, insisting he had been at the other affected areas, adding. “There’s been a round the clock response,” he said.</p>
      <p>There was more trouble for Mr Johnson away from the floods as former Cabinet minister David Gauke, now an independent MP, warned a Tory election victory would trigger a “disastrous no-deal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> ”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> admitted while on the campaign trail in Scotland that Labour could block a second ­referendum on independence.</p>
