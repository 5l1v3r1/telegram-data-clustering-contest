      <h1>Jedi: Fallen Order Composers Say It’s Star Wars’ Darkest Chapter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T02:11:25+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 02:11</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>The trailers for EA’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order"><b>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</b></a> have already shown that the journey ahead for Cal Kestis will be challenging. But it also appears to take a turn towards the Dark Side as well. During an interview with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2019/11/13/scared-you-will-bejedi-fallen-order-is-basically-a-star-wars-horror-story-composers-say/#79b8594c626f">Forbes</a>, the composers behind <b>Fallen Order</b> talked about the game’s approach and tone. And judging by what they’ve seen, it could be the darkest chapter in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b> </a>lore to date.</p>
      <p>“It’s a point where it’s not really a battle against the Empire — they’re just the Empire,” explained composer Stephen Barton. “They’ve taken over and being a Jedi is an incredibly bad idea. I think I was trying to see how we could push the envelope with (the score) in terms of expectation and how we could really kind of get over to that point that obviously this is a new tale — almost in a time where the optimism of the later trilogy, we’re not there yet. This is the deepest, darkest time of the galaxy.”</p>
      <p>The game takes place after <b>Revenge of the Sith</b>, just as the Empire begins shoring up its control of the galaxy. Players step into the role of Cal as he finds himself pursued by dangerous foes, including the Second Sister.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the incredibly dark tone, the composers felt the need to keep something familiar with <b>Jedi: Fallen Order</b>.</p>
      <p>“The John Williams element has to be there, at least for the audience to hold onto — to remind them that they’re in the <b>Star Wars</b> canon and the <b>Star Wars </b>universe,” explained co-composer Gordy Haab. “If you divert too far from that, you’re gonna lose people. Our goal was to see how far we could stretch and stray from that sound while still staying within the <b>Star Wars </b>universe…Some of the music actually borders on gothic horror in some places and certainly dark, emotionally speaking. John Williams touched on it in some of the films, but I think this kind of lives there. The foundation of it is very much a dark score.”</p>
      <p>“This is as dark as <b>Star Wars</b> gets,” concluded Haab.</p>
