      <h1>Real-Life Minecraft Mobs Appear to Celebrate Minecraft Earth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:00:30+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>In celebration of <i>Minecraft Earth</i>’s continued early access rollout, Microsoft has unveiled ‘Mobs in the Park’. The event, which was announced at X019, will give players in London, Sydney, and New York access to an exclusive new in-game adventure, starting this weekend.</p>
      <p>Life-size statues of the Muddy Pig, Moobloom, and brand-new (and extremely festive) Jolly Llama have arrived in three locations; Hudson Yard in New York City, Queen’s Walk in London, and Campbell’s Cove in Sydney. They’ll be available from 10:00 to 19:00 local time on the 16/17, 23/24, and 30 November - 1 December, with a bonus New York pop-up on Black Friday.</p>

      <p>When you find the mobs, scanning the QR code on the Jolly Llama will unlock a new adventure developed by the <i>Minecraft Earth</i> team. Completing that adventure will grant players exclusive early access to the new mob in-game, ahead of its official release next month. If you can’t be there in-person, the Llama will arrive in the game after the event ends in a few weeks’ time.</p>
