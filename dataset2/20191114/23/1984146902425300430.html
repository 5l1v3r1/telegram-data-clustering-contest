      <h1>Hapless drug user found it 'too much hard work' to look after his cannabis plants</h1>
      <h2>Police found the dying plants when they searched Phillip Wright's home after he was found with a knuckle duster</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Nichol</a></address>
      <p>A drug user who was found with dying cannabis plants in his house claimed it was 'too much hard work to look after them'.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Police</a> searched the home of Phillip Wright after he was found in possession of the class B drug and a knuckle duster on Tate Street, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/blyth">Blyth</a>.</p>
      <p>A court heard that officers found four dying cannabis plants, along with cultivation equipment, in the 43-year-old's bedroom.</p>
      <p>But, despite the leaves being "practically dust", Wright was still charged with producing the drug and appeared at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court</a> to plead guilty to the charge.</p>
      <p>Described as "not the world's greatest gardener" by his own solicitor, Wright claimed he'd researched how to grow cannabis on Google for his own use.</p>
      <p>He told a Probation officer: "This is the first time I'd tried growing them and I Googled them and bought the equipment.</p>
      <p>"But it was too much hard work to look after them and the plants died."</p>
      <p>Wright also pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis and amphetamine and to one count of possessing a knuckle duster.</p>
      <p>The court heard that he had a previous conviction for possessing a knife from 2001, meaning he faced a minimum six-month immediate prison sentence for a second offence of possessing a bladed article or offensive weapon.</p>
      <p>But magistrates deemed that the past conviction was 18-years-ago and, instead, gave Wright a 12-month community order with 100 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Lorna Rimell, prosecuting, said police had cause to stop-and-search Wright, of Cowpen Road, Blyth, in the town on the morning of September 8 this year.</p>
      <p>They found him to be in possession of cannabis, amphetamine and the knuckle duster.</p>
      <p>Ms Rimell said: "Police later searched the defendant's property and found a bedroom in the address, which appeared to be set-up for the production of cannabis.</p>
      <p>"It had equipment in it for the cultivation of cannabis. Officers also found four cannabis plants in the bedroom, which were not looking particularly healthy.</p>
      <p>"There was a foil ventilation tube and the windows were covered over to keep the heat in."</p>
      <p>Paul Dunn, defending, said Wright had the knuckle duster for his own protection and hadn't planned on using it.</p>
      <p>"As for the cannabis plants," he added. "He's not the world's greatest gardener. He made an attempt to grow some cannabis and failed spectacularly.</p>
      <p>"When I talked to him about the cannabis production charge, he told me 'They were just about dust'."</p>
      <p>The court heard Wright uses amphetamine and cannabis on a daily basis but doesn't drink alcohol.</p>
