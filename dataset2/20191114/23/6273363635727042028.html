      <h1>Luigi’s Mansion 3 has the best U.S. debut month for the franchise</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:35:19+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/mike-minotti/" target="_blank">Mike Minotti</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review-stepping-into-nintendos-top-tier/">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a> may have come out on October 31, but it still managed to be the third best-selling game in the U.S. for the month. That’s according to market analyst The NPD Group.</p>
      <p>Luigi’s latest spooky adventure was also the best-selling <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/01/nintendo-president-switch-lite-isnt-cannibalizing-the-switch/">Switch</a> game for October. It also had the best debut month for any entry in the franchise, beating the original Luigi’s Mansion.</p>
      <p>The first Luigi’s Mansion was a launch game for the GameCube back in November 2001. Its first sequel, Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon, came out for the 3DS in 2013.</p>
      <p>Luigi’s Mansion 3 wasn’t the only new Switch game to chart. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/17/ring-fit-adventure-review-exercise-the-rpg/">Ring Fit Adventure</a> was No. 10 on The NPD Group’s October list. The Switch was also the month’s best-selling console.</p>
      <p>And if you’re wondering what the month’s best-selling game was, that honor goes (unsurprisingly) to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-outselling-black-ops-4-by-healthy-margin/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a>.</p>
