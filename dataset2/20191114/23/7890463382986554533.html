      <h1>AOC reaches Silver in League of Legends, but she’s not the best player in Congress</h1>

        <b>Game fans once had a dream. As government pressure started coming down on videogame violence in past decades – often with some significantly malinformed politicians at the head – we’d often wonder about that future day when our generation started taking office, and people who understood videogames might finally be in charge. While <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/trump-violent-games">US President Donald Trump’s recent statements on violent games</a> might’ve made that hope waver, it seems we’re finally there.</b>
      </p>
      <p>US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared on Instagram this week that she’d made it to Silver IV in League of Legends – a big improvement over her <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/league-of-legends-alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Bronze V position last year</a>. While <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/league-of-legends/aoc-silver-rank">AOC’s Silver rank</a> was a point of pride when the news made it to <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1194753757537550336">Twitter</a>, it turns out she’s not the best League player in Congress.</p>
      <p>Instead, that honour belongs to Representative Josh Harder – at least as far as we know. Harder is ranked Platinum, and has a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshHarder/status/1194760623189581825">bit of wisdom</a> in mind for his fellow politicians: “Congress might work better if more battles were fought on Summoner’s Rift instead of committee hearings.”</p>
      <p>A month ago, AOC added her name to a bipartisan letter <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/us-senate-activision-blizzard-hong-kong">urging Blizzard to “reverse course” on its ban of Hearthstone pro Blitzchung</a>. At the very least, we can say that one politician who has things to say about videogames actually knows something about them, which is a nice break from the past 30-odd years.</p>
