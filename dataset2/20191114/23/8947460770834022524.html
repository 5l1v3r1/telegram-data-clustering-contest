      <h1>BMW Group premieres the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich</h1>
      <h2>The automobile has been amongst us for over a century. And automobility has been obtainable for the middle class since the end of World War …</h2>

      <p>Paving the way to the electromobility of the future begins at its most microscopic level: the battery cell. BMW Group is the very first automotive constructor which has developed pioneering Competence Center where it will master the electric batteries that will completely reshape the industry. The fundamental breakthrough in the science of battery cell architecture will be the augmentation of the electric cell density, which will potentially the battery output, the storage capacity and, inevitably, it will dramatically improve the electric driving range.</p>
      <p>Present at the opening of the new high-tech battery cell Competence Centre in Munich, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse acknowledged: “The new Battery Cell Competence Centre puts us in an enviable position. Taking the technology currently in the BMW i3 as a basis, by 2030 we will be able to double the energy density of our battery cells – and therefore also the operating range of the vehicles for our customers.”</p>

      <p>By 2030, the constructor estimates that it will succeed in more than doubling the current electric density, which will directly improve the battery lifetime, the consumption and the drive range. Developing such daring technologies requires an optimal test bed, so the revolutionary BMW i3 is fully involved as part of this ambitious project.</p>
      <p>Improving and maximizing the potential of the value chain in production is the key to transformation. BMW intends to accelerate on the program designed to develop the electric battery of the future. Thus, the BMW Group is investing a total of € 200 million in the Competence Centre and employs 200 people here.</p>
      <p>Material selection for the battery components is also carefully examined and new solution are looked out for. Recycling in a friendly manner is also another topic of the value chain to be set up in the Competence Centre and visible progress has been recorded with the help of the serially-produced i3. The cobalt and lithium will be externally procured from mines located in countries such Australia and Morocco.</p>

      <p>By 2023, BMW Group will have already launched 25 electrified models. By year 2025, it aims the target of having one third of the models sold to be electrified vehicles, and by 2030, it plans that half of the models sold to be purely electric. With the help of the Competence Centre, this business will gain further traction. Building an entire value stream of competencies and improving knowledge on all steps in battery cell production, from the most minute details up to the end consumer, will certainly put BMW Group in a top position for the future.</p>
