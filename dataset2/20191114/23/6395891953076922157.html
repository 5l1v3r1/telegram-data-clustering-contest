      <p><b>NEWBURYPORT, Mass.</b> - A local high school is leading the way in educating teens on the dangers of vaping, and it's all thanks to a student's Girl Scout project. </p>
      <p>Annemarie Noe launched the anti-vaping campaign in the school's bathroom where she noticed dozens of students vaping several times a day. </p>

      <p>"Every day I'd come to school and I'd see my friends vape, and everyone vaping," said Noe.</p>
      <p>Three years ago, Noe was a freshman, new to Newburyport High School and curious about a new trend called vaping.</p>
      <p>"Once I realized how bad vaping was, I was like I need to tell people," she told us. </p>
      <p>Noe decided to take on vaping as her Girl Scout project, she spent hours making signs, developing a website and creating a new vaping curriculum for her peers with the help of the school's wellness teacher. </p>
      <p>"It is very new and there's not a lot of information out there," said wellness teacher Amy Heath. </p>
      <p>The pair spent hours researching the dangers of vaping and passed on the lifesaving information to students. </p>
      <p>"Instead of just doing a weeklong unit it's now become weeks and kids doing projects on it and doing some of their own research as well," said Heath. </p>
      <p>Now, three years later, bathrooms in the high school are filled with signs warning students of the dangers of vaping.</p>
      <p>"I walked into the bathroom at school and saw a lot less people vaping, which made me really happy," said Noe. </p>
      <p>But now, Noe is going beyond walls, working with Newburyport's mayor on an anti-vaping social media campaign.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, I can't control your actions but I can make sure you have a solid foundation on what you're putting into your body," she said. </p>
      <p>Noe says the next step is creating informational pamphlets to put in local doctor offices.</p>
