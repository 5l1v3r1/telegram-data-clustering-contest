      <p><i>Little Mermaid’s</i> Lin-Manuel Miranda made a general call for more “<a href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1195041604865798144">gun control now,</a>” while <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/">Piper Perabo</a> (pictured, right) used the shooting to push for universal background checks in particular.</p>
      <p>Perabo did not mention that California has had universal background checks since the 1990s. The state also has an “assault weapons” ban, a 10-day waiting period on gun purchases, and a requirement that would-be gun buyers get a safety certificate from the state before buying a firearm.</p>
      <p>California has a one-handgun-a month purchase limit, registration requirements for gun owners, ammunition controls, gun confiscation laws, and a ban on teachers being armed to shoot back in case they are under attack.</p>
