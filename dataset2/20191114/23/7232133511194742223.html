      <h1>Ethereum’s Bollinger Bands Signal That a Massive Movement is Imminent</h1>

      <p>Ethereum has been stuck below its near-term resistance level at $190 for the past several weeks, and both ETH’s bulls and bears have been deadlocked as they hold the cryptocurrency steady within the mid-$180 region.</p>
      <p>This bout of sideways trading may soon be coming to an end, however, as analysts are now noting that ETH’s Bollinger Bands are currently squeezing, which means that a massive price movement could be imminent.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum Stuck in $180 Range as Resistance Holds Strong</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/ethereum-may-be-gearing-up-for-bullish-movement-as-on-chain-volume-declines/">Ethereum</a> is trading down 1% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">current price</a> of $185.70, which marks a slight retrace from its daily highs of $190 that were set yesterday in a brief upwards movement that ultimately resulted in another rejection at this resistance level.</p>
      <p>Currently, ETH is trading its lowest price seen over the past 24-hours, but it is nearing a region where it has consistently found decent buying pressure, meaning that it may be able to hold steady above this level in the near-term assuming that there is no major Bitcoin movement that guides the aggregated markets.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin has been contributing to ETH’s bout of sideways trading, as it has been caught around $8,700 for the past several days after being rejected from the lower-$9,000 region earlier this week.</p>
      <h3>A Big ETH Movement Could Be Inbound in Near-Future</h3>
      <p>Ethereum’s Bollinger Bands are currently incredibly tight, which could signal that a massive price movement is imminent.</p>
      <p>RJ, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, explaining that November has also historically been a month of tremendous volatility for the cryptocurrency.</p>
      <blockquote>“$ETH / USD: November squeeze, one of the biggest we’ve ever seen: BBW grinding the bottom for almost two months now. Nov ’17 – Start of the bullrun, $280 –&gt; $1400. Nov ’18 – Start of the capitulation, $230 –&gt; $80. Nov ’19 – ?” he noted while pointing to the below chart.</blockquote>

      <p>As for where this volatility could send ETH, MoonOverlord, another poplar crypto analyst, explained in the chart found within the below tweet that he believes the crypto could target $300 in the near-term.</p>

      <p>The coming hours and days could be pivotal for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/06/29/ethereum-despite-recent-volatility-analysts-believe-eth-could-soon-test-363/">Ethereum</a>, as its response to its tight Bollinger Bands could set the tone for how it trends throughout the rest of the year.</p>
