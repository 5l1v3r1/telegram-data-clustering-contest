      <h1>PayPal pauses payouts to PornHub porn models</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:34:51+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/xeni_jardin" target="_blank">Xeni Jardin</a></address>
      <p>PayPal on Thursday says it has halted payment support for models with PornHub, the online adult site, after Paypal says it found that Pornhub made certain payments without PayPal's permission.</p>
      <p>“Following a review, we have discovered that PornHub has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission. We have taken action to stop these transactions from occurring,” PayPal said in an email statement.</p>
      <p>PayPal hasn't explained why, beyond that.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-pornhub/paypal-halts-payment-support-to-pornhub-models-idUSKBN1XO2SV?il=0">Reuters</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>PornHub, owned by Luxembourg-headquartered company MindGeek, said it was “devastated by PayPal’s decision to stop payouts to over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods”. MindGeek did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.</blockquote>
