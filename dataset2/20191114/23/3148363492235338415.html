      <p>An Emmy-winning former NBC medical correspondent has been accused of asking a nine-year-old girl for sexually explicit photos.</p>
      <p>Authorities with the Los Angeles Police Department’s Juvenile Division arrested Dr. Bruce Hensel, 71, on Wednesday morning for allegedly asking the girl for sexually charged pictures, KABC <a href="https://abc7.com/ex-tv-medical-correspondent-arrested-by-lapd-juvenile-division/5624361/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Hensel was released from custody later in the day after posting $5,000 bond.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement that Hensel was charged with one felony count of contact with a minor for sexual purposes.</p>
      <p>Hensel allegedly asked the daughter of an acquaintance for the images using a messaging app on or about August 4, according to Deputy District Attorney Angela Brunson of the DA’s Cyber Crimes Division.</p>
      <p>Hensel worked as a medical correspondent for KNBC for nearly three decades, and also held jobs as an on-air medical correspondent at NBC in New York and KCOP in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>If convicted on the charges, Hensel faces up to 18 months in state prison, according to prosecutors. His arraignment is scheduled to be at a later date, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-13/dr-bruce-hensel-former-tv-correspondent-asked-girl-to-send-sexually-suggestive-photos-prosecutors-say">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Hensel’s lawyer said the arrest came as a surprise.</p>
      <p>“We are cooperating fully with the authorities and we are looking forward to a speedy and complete exoneration,” Sitkoff <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Dr-Bruce-Hensel-Longtime-Medical-Correspondent-Arrested-in-Solicitation-of-Minor-Case-564879912.html">told</a> NBC 4 Los Angeles.</p>
