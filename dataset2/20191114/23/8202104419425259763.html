      <h3>The two inmates who escaped from the Saskatoon Regional Psychiatric Centre are back in custody.</h3>
      <p>Kendal Lee Campeau, 29, was arrested without incident on Thursday around 1:45 a.m. at a home in the 500 block of Douglas Crescent by members of the Saskatoon police guns and gangs unit, with assistance from patrol and canine units.</p>
      <p>Matthew Shaundel Michel, 24, was located by RCMP at Sunset Estates east of the city and taken into police custody approximately 12 hours after Campeau was found.</p>
      <p>According to RCMP, Michel traveled in a stolen vehicle from near Warman to the Humboldt area. Police attempted a traffic stop near Humboldt but the vehicle was driven from the scene on Highway 5 towards Saskatoon, eventually running out of gas near Sunset Estates. RCMP said Michel walked into the Sunset Estates community, at which point Saskatoon RCMP, Humboldt RCMP and Saskatoon police located him on the roof of a home. Police said Michel, after threatening to hurt himself if officers approached, surrendered to police after a short negotiation.</p>

      <p>Campeau and Michel were reported missing from the federal facility on Wednesday around 8:40 p.m., police told The StarPhoenix. <span dir="auto">The institution did not identify the level of security under which the two inmates are being held. RPC has minimum-, medium- and maximum-security areas.</span></p>
      <p>Both men are considered violent, police said. There were no injuries associated with the escape, RPC spokesman Tim Krause said.</p>
      <p>When RPC staff realized there were patients unaccounted for and that there may have been an escape, an emergency lockdown and count were implemented.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Campeau was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of attempted escape, kidnapping and forcibly seizing three guards at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre while armed with shanks made from an oven rack. He and two other inmates were drunk on prison-made alcohol and hand sanitizer when they forced their way into a staff office at the facility, holding weapons to the guards’ throats and demanding their keys.</p>
