      <p>“This is not true," Camille stated on Twitter on Thursday.</p>
      <p>She continued: "My parents were with us in the Hamptons when we received the news about his moms passing. We consoled him and flew back to LA to make arrangements for her funeral.</p>

      <p>The reality star’s retort comes after the 64-year-old “Frasier” star told Graham Bensinger: “The day of my mother’s funeral, my third wife basically had an explosion about something and she started telling me, ‘I’m out of this, I’m out of here. I want a divorce, blah, blah blah — which, we’d had the same conversation for eight years, and it was tiresome.’”</p>
