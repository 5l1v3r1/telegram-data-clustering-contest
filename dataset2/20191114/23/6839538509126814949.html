      <p>The lead-up to December 25 is one of the busiest times of the year but it doesn’t have to be? Perhaps it’s time to outsource some of those yuletide chores?</p>
      <p>You might just save yourself tears – and dollars as well – if you make a list of chores and pay someone else to do the sweaty, little stuff (and even tackle some of the bigger) yuletide jobs.</p>
      <p>Although your treetop might glisten, if your school-aged children won’t listen to your calls for hands-on help, you could always give the likes of Airtasker or Gumtree a ting-a-ling and find out what elf is out there.</p>
      <p><i>Saved By Michelle</i>has discovered there are a variety of domestic, handy all-rounders eager to slay problems that fall somewhere within the range of “wouldn’t that be nice?” to “we’ll have to cancel Christmas this year”.</p>

      <p>And according to Sabine Leroy, a money specialist at Finder, the Festive Season is reason enough to arrange for someone else to deck your halls.</p>
      <p>“Between concerts, end-of-year parties and buying gifts – Christmas is a busy time of year – sometimes the stress just isn’t worth the saving,” she says.</p>
      <p>“With sites like Airtasker, you can find people in your area who can help with cleaning windows for your Christmas party, or to even put up the Christmas tree.”</p>
      <p>But don’t forget to take some Scrooge-style precautions.</p>
      <p>“If you have time, it’s always best to look at getting three quotes to make sure you’re getting the best deal,” she says.</p>
      <p>“If your kids are old enough, why not outsource chores to them for a bit of extra spending money for the holidays?”</p>
      <p><i>Saved By Michelle</i>did a check around some of the sites that offered one-off or occasional services.</p>
      <p>Over at Gumtree we learned that someone prepared to give a household a party-ready clean charges as little as $30 an hour (with a two-hour minimum); a yard clean-up job costs $40 an hour; and, if you are expecting visitors – but just can’t be bothered or freaking out at the organising involved – there are caterers willing to step in (via Gumtree) for as little as $8 per guest.</p>
      <p>And Gumtree’s Head of Marketing, Amanda Behre, says the money you pay could be helping someone else in your community have a happier holiday season.</p>
      <p>“In the lead-up to the festive season we are seeing more people outsourcing Christmas and holiday preparation to help ease the load of the busy period, with services such as putting up the Christmas tree, catering Christmas celebrations and pet-sitting during the summer holidays available onsite,” she says. “By facilitating safe local exchanges within communities, Gumtree continues to help Australians have a stress-free and enjoyable holiday period.”</p>
      <p>Based on the disclosed figures for the last two years of Australia-wide, task take-up on Airtasker, someone eager to put your Christmas lights up can be hired for about $120; $230 will secure someone to actually do your Christmas shopping on your behalf; a backyard clean-up comes in at under $160; while a whole house clean-up is yours for a smidgen under $130.</p>
      <p>Brisbane’s Justin O’Neill (pictured) has been on Airtasker for the past four years and in that time has completed 939 tasks for a kaleidoscope of clientele with a Christmas hamper worth of excuses for not helping themselves.</p>
      <p>Largely, he says, his clientele simply either doesn’t own the right (or any) tools, lacks a ute, or the time – while some people lack the strength and ability.</p>
      <p>“The main type of job I do is rubbish removals of general or green waste, and that can mean anything from jackhammering a concrete slab, to removing a fence, or just unwanted household items,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I also mow lawns and do small moves and build trampolines.”</p>
