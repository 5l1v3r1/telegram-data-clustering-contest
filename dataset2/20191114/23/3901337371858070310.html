        <b>UEFA Euro 2020 Qualifier</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Portugal 6-0 Lithuania</p>

      <p>Venue: Estadio Lisbon</p>
      <p>Portugal kept their 2020 European Championship hopes alive as a hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo inspired the European champions to 6-0 victory over Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Goncalo Paciencia debuted alongside captain Ronaldo and Bernardo Silva while another new boy Pizzi was also thrown in the mix, as the Selecao targeted qualification to next yearâ€™s finals.</p>
      <p>Portugal hit the front just after seven minutes when Ronaldo stepped up from the penalty mark to rifle in to the back of the net after going down in the area seconds earlier.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo heaped more misery on the visitors when he found the far corner from the left hand side with a superb curling effort 12 minutes later.</p>
      <p>Portugal were in total control on all fronts and missed a couple of chances to prolong their advantage, particularly Ronaldo flashing over the top from a tight angle ten minutes before halftime.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese continued from their remarkable first half display as Pizzi rifled in off the underside of the crossbar two minutes in from an acute angle on the right.</p>
      <p>Paciencia rewarded Fernando Santos for the vote of confidence bestowed in him when the debutant tapped home a low cross in the area on 55 minutes.</p>
      <p>The scenario worsened for the adversaries as Silva picked up a loose ball from an exchange of passes on 63 minutes to fire down to the bottom far corner.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo completed his hat-trick five minutes later when he collected a pass from Silva to send the delivery into the far corner of an unguarded net.</p>
      <p>Portugal pushed for more goals later on despite their healthy advantage, but a six-goal blitz was what the holders had to settle for.</p>
