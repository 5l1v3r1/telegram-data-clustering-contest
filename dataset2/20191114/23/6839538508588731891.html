      <p>Teacher Lisa Carlton was not surprised her Year 6 group at Seaforth Public School was able to sketch out some designs for a new building to hit Sydney’s skyline but she said the breadth of incredible ideas, backed up with their images, came as the truly pleasant shock.</p>
      <p>But the Seaforth Public School teacher said the breadth of incredible ideas which they backed up their images with came as the truly pleasant shock from the exercise.</p>

      <p>“My class is very creative and this was a good opportunity for them to use creative thinking to do something quite real,” Ms Carlton said.</p>
      <p>Working alone or in pairs or threes, the kids jumped at The Daily Telegraph’s call out to NSW public school students to design Sydney’s next great building.</p>
      <p>Amber Riddle created a tower, surrounded by surfboards with a fountain than runs through the middle. She wants it to be located in the middle of North Sydney and be a place where workers can enjoy their lunch break.</p>
      <p>Angie Procter and Josie Lear worked together on the exotically-named Becchiere Triagolo — or glass triangle in Italian.</p>

      <p>This multi-coloured and multi-layered building would sit on the southeast side of Goat Island and be a place to enjoy sightseeing.</p>
      <p>“Knowing that a real audience would be looking at their designs really boosted their engagement,” Ms Carlton said.</p>
      <p>And the chance to win a class trip to Luna Park helped too.</p>
      <p>A couple of students were keen to design the ­interior of their buildings as well but simply ran out of time.</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph launched the competition as part of the Bradfield Oration campaign which draws on the vision and drive of Sir John Bradfield who ­created the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</p>
