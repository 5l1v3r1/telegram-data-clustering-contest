      <p>X Factor: Celebrity's Nicole Scherzinger looked sensational as always.</p>
      <p>The X Factor personality, 41, turned heads on her arrival at the twinkling Steve Madde x Winnie Harlow launch party, in London on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Dramatic ruffled detailing on her shoulders drew attention to Nicole's hourglass shape while she partied the night away in her stunning LBD.</p>
      <p>Most of her enviably-toned legs were on show when she stepped out in the thigh-grazing ensemble.</p>
      <p>Silver shimmer outlined her eyes and made the pop star's dazzling appearance stand out as she hit the town.</p>

      <p>Rumours were swirling the band would make a return to the stage for their first gig in more than a decade, according to the <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>A source claimed: “The X Factor ­producers approached Nicole about the idea of performing with the girls and she jumped at the chance.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be their first big ­performance of the reunion and will be extra special for Nicole because of her role in the show.</p>

      <p>“Having the Pussycat Dolls perform is a real coup for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> and he has told Nicole to pull out all the stops to make sure their routine gets people talking.”</p>
      <p>The Pussycat Dolls, made up of Nicole, Meoldy Thornton, Kimberley Wyatt, Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar and Jessica Sutta, split officially in 2010.</p>
      <p>They all went onto chase their dreams of solo singing careers.</p>
