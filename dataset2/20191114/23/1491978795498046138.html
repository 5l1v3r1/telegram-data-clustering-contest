      <h1>Euro 2020 roundup: Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick fires Portugal to verge of finals</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> scored his ninth international hat-trick, moving to 98 goals for his country, as Portugal thumped Lithuania 6-0 in a Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>The Portugal captain, whose treble was the 55th of his career, could become only the second player to score a century for his country after Iran’s Ali Daei. Ronaldo showed no sign of the knee problem that led to him being substituted in his previous two games for Juventus – prompting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/cristiano-ronaldo-angered-substitution-juventus-milan">an angry reaction</a> on the second occasion. Pizzi, Gonçalo Paciência and Bernardo Silva shared the other goals in the one-sided Group B match.</p>
      <p>The European champions were left waiting to confirm their place at next year’s finals after Aleksandar Mitrovic struck twice in <b>Serbia’s</b> 3-2 home win against <b>Luxembourg</b>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal">Portugal</a> are second with 14 points, one ahead of Serbia, and will qualify if they win in Luxembourg on Sunday. The Group B leaders, Ukraine, have already made the finals.</p>
      <p><b>France</b>’s efforts to celebrate their qualification were almost spoiled by <b>Moldova</b>, with an Olivier Giroud penalty sparing their blushes as they came from behind to win 2-1 and go top of Group H. <b>Turkey’</b>s scoreless draw with <b>Iceland</b> ensured they and the world champions would qualify from the group, but the Moldovans were intent on spoiling the French party.</p>
      <p>They took the lead in the ninth minute when Clément Lenglet followed up a bad defensive header with an even worse one, giving Vadim Rata the chance to poke the ball home. France equalised in controversial circumstances in the 35th minute when Giroud challenged Alexei Cosele, forcing the Moldova keeper to spill the ball for Raphaël Varane to head into an empty net. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/france">France</a> struggled to find a winner and it took a 79th-minute Giroud penalty for a foul on Lucas Digne to secure the three points.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere in the group, <b>Albania</b> had to come from behind to grab a 2-2 draw at home to <b>Andorra</b>.</p>
      <p><b>The Czech Republic </b><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/england-montenegro-euro-2020-qualifer-match-report">joined England</a> in qualifying for Euro 2020 from Group A by coming from behind to beat <b>Kosovo</b> 2-1. The home side dominated possession but failed to convert their chances before falling behind when Atdhe Nuhiu scored against the run of play in the 50th minute. They equalised when the 21-year-old midfielder Alex Kral pounced on a loose ball and unleashed a fierce strike that gave the Kosovo keeper no chance. That goal energised the Czechs who hit the woodwork twice in quick succession before Kral directed a header towards Ondrej Celustka who guided the winner home with 11 minutes to go.</p>
      <p>“It’s awesome,” Kral said. “We worked to qualify and it’s done. We reacted well to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/kosovo">Kosovo</a> goal and now we’re through.”</p>
