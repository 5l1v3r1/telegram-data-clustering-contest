      <p>It’s time for another Viacom card from Israel when Bellator 234 kicks off from the Menora Mivtachim Arena in Tel Aviv this Friday. The tape delay broadcast will air on the Paramount Network at 9:00 PM, and will be capped off with a heavyweight tilt between Sergei Kharitonov and Linton Vassell.</p>

      <p>Longtime MMA veteran Kharitonov has amassed a 2-1-1 record since joining the Bellator promotion. He has proven to still be a dangerous striker, stopping the likes of Roy Nelson and Matt Mitrione in recent memory. The Russian has not tasted defeat since November of 2016. His opponent, Vassell, is looking to get back on track after enduring a three-fight losing skid against some of Bellator’s very best. Now looking to rock out at heavyweight, could Kharitonov be just what the well-rounded Brit needs to get back into the win column?</p>
      <p>Another longtime MMA veteran will be showcased in the Bellator 234 co-main event when the 24-11-1 Roger Huerta meets the 13-3 Sidney Outlaw. The Viacom promotion hasn’t been very kind to Huerta, who has posted a sad 1-4 record in total. Huerta was once viewed as the future of the sport, but never really lived up to the hype. Nonetheless, he will be welcoming Outlaw to the organization, who is riding an eight-fight winning streak. Outlaw has a knack for the sub. He has finished seven of his 13 wins by way of tap, with one of them occurring with a knockout. Huerta is an excellent opponent to see just where Outlaw will fit in within the promotion.</p>
      <p>Also on the Israel card, the undefeated Austin Vanderford, special love interest of Paige VanZant, will be hunting for his third finish in a row. Looking to spoil Vanderford’s third Bellator appearance will be the Russian born Grachik Bozinyan. It wouldn’t be a Bellator Israel card without an appearance from the Gozali family. Father and son duo, Haim and Aviv, will share a Bellator card once again. The 11-6 father, Haim, will face the 16-3 Russian Artur Pronin. The 3-0 son, Aviv, will be squaring off with the 14-8 Zaka Fatullazade, hailing from Azerbaijan.</p>
