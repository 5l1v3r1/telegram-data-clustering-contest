        <b>Listen to the HSJ Health Check podcast — this week we examine the Labour party’s big NHS announcement, and the exit of Greater Manchester’s “devo health” chief.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each week, HSJ Health Check gathers a cast from our team of expert journalists, to explain and debate the most important news issues right now in NHS policy and leadership.</p>
      <p>You can listen above, follow <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7xRYYFPHmSSrJ1Ggo8GUJ7">us on Spotify</a>, listen on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hsj-health-check/id1484397315?uo=4">Apple Podcasts</a>, or <a href="https://anchor.fm/hsj-health-check">other podcast platforms</a>.</p>
      <p>The latest episode features <i>HSJ</i> editor Alastair McLellan, deputy editor Dave West, correspondent Annabelle Collins, and bureau chief Lawrence Dunhill.</p>
      <p>We examine what we learned from Labour’s big election campaign NHS funding announcement this week – and what it says about how the party would manage the service. Plus we talk about the decision of Greater Manchester’s “devo” health and care chief Jon Rouse to quit, and what this means for GM and the devo health agenda.</p>
