      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 15 November 2019</p>
      <p>Minecraft Dungeons, developer Mojang's somewhat unexpected but entirely appealing Minecraft dungeon-crawler spin-off, is one step closer to receiving a full release date. Microsoft has now revealed that it'll be coming to Xbox One, PC, Switch, and PS4 in April next year.</p>
      <p>Set, unsurprisingly, in the Minecraft universe, Dungeons delivers procedurally generated bouts of co-operative monster slaying and treasure hunting for up to four players. But while it might have a friendly Minecraft face, featuring familiar mobs and the series' unmistakable art style, it's still a fully realised take on the genre, with ample loot to gather, a range of combat styles to master - including melee to ranged - as well as deadly traps and creatures to overcome.</p>
      <p>According to Dungeons' non-release-date-revealing release date trailer below, those that <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/dungeons">sign-up via Mojang's website</a> will be in with a chance of playing the game first. Nowhere is that elaborated on, but it sounds like some sort of beta might be planned ahead of launch.</p>

      <p>Eurogamer's Tom Phillips was quite taken with Minecraft Dungeons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-20-minecraft-dungeons-doesnt-need-to-be-a-minecraft-game-but-its-better-for-it">at this year's Gamescom</a>, and it seems to be shaping up to be an enjoyable, if rather left-field, use of the Minecraft brand.</p>
      <p>We'll know if Mojang's latest effort - which apparently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-28-minecraft-dungeons-started-life-as-a-3ds-game">started life as a 3DS game</a> - is a successful new direction when it comes to Xbox One, PC, Xbox Game Pass, PS4, and Switch next April.</p>
