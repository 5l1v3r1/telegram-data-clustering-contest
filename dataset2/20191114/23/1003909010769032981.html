      </p>
      <p>The Alberta Securities Commission has issued sanctions against a man who defrauded investors with a Ponzi-like scheme in Alberta while on the run from U.S. law enforcement.</p>
      <p>The regulator announced Thursday it has ordered Brian Arthur Kitts and his former company — a real estate financing firm based in Bragg Creek called Vesta Capcorp Inc. — to pay a $600,000 penalty (plus $150,000 to cover the costs of its investigation and hearing) in relation to a fraud committed against investors in the province between February 2014 and June 2015.</p>
      <p>Kitts was also ordered to pay back the more than $1.9 million of investor funds he misappropriated from about 38 investors, many of whom suffered significant individual financial losses as a result of the fraud, according to the ASC.</p>
      <p>The ASC panel that made the decision ruled that Kitts engaged in “fraudulent misconduct” by misrepresenting to investors how their funds would be used, diverting funds to unidentified businesses not within investors’ reasonable expectations, and using investors’ capital to repay principal and pay imaginary profits to investors. The ASC also concluded Kitts misappropriated investor funds for his personal use.</p>
      <p>At the time of the misconduct, Kitts had already pleaded no contest to criminal charges related to securities fraud and theft in Utah — however, he fled the U.S. before sentencing could occur. In its decision, the ASC said the fact that Kitts continued his fraudulent activity in Alberta in the face of regulatory sanction and criminal proceedings elsewhere was an aggravating factor and led to the conclusion he posed a “pronounced risk to the public.”</p>
      <p>“His behaviour is indicative of a brazen scofflaw with a callous disregard for the victims he duped,” the ASC written decision read.</p>

      <p>Kitts has since been sentenced to imprisonment in the U.S. on four counts of securities fraud and theft.</p>
      <p>The ASC also ordered an array of permanent market access bans against both Kitts and his company.</p>
