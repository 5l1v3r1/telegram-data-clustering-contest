      <p>The Cleveland Browns pulled out all the stops for Thursday’s primetime showdown with the Pittsburgh Steelers, which included a comically bad giveaway.</p>
      <p>It’s always nice when teams hook fans up with free swag for attending games, but the Browns went a bit too far in attempting to get cute with their item.</p>
      <p>Many teams elect to go with simple items such as t-shirts or towels, but the Browns do things differently. Instead, they did a giveaway which entailed them hooking fans up with “dawg noses.”</p>
      <p>And yeah, they looked as ridiculous as you’d imagine. The first 35,000 fans into FirstEnergy Stadium received one of these.</p>
