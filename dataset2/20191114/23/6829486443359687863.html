      <h1>You Need To See This Small Child Drumming The Shit Out Of Nirvana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:17:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:17</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>If there’s one thing that we’ve learned over the last few years, it’s that the kids are alright.</p>
      <p>The youth are leading the fight for gun control in the US, and the fight against the inaction of politicians on <a href="https://junkee.com/global-climate-strike-2019/222674">climate change the world over</a>. They are an energised, intelligent, and politically active generation, who spend their whole lives speaking truth to power.</p>
      <p>Oh, and they also have excellent music taste.</p>
      <p>Need proof? Just check out the drumming prowess of Nandi Bushell, an English child who uploads short videos of her rocking out to classic tunes onto her Instagram — most notably, a clip of her absolutely slaying <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/nirvana">Nirvana</a>‘s ‘In Bloom.’</p>
      <p>And hell, not only is Bushell a talented technical drummer, she also manages to embody the pure spirit of Nirvana, screaming along to the drumming with a sheer force that would make Dave Grohl himself proud.</p>

      <p>In fact, Bushell’s already attracted the attention of a bunch of legendary musicians, with <a href="https://junkee.com/flea-memoir-review/226394">Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers</a> taking to his own Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4x83n3BP-b/">to reshare her video along with a heartwarming message.</a> “GO NANDI!” he wrote “GO GIRL! FEEL IT! DO IT! BE IT! YOU ARE IT!</p>
      <p>Oh, and if that wasn’t all adorable enough, check out Bushell’s original, Nirvana-loving caption. “Nirvana are in my top five bands so far,” she writes. “I just found out Dave also played with Jack Black in Tenacious D, Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age!!!! The film <i>School of Rock</i> is the best film in the world.”</p>
      <p>Mark my words: it will simply be a matter of days until we get a photograph of Grohl and Bushell drumming alongside each other, or throwing up the devil horns together, or just generally being mates. I bet you.</p>
