      <h1>Bitcoin Bull Tone Vays Pits Ripple and XRP Against PayPal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:26:59+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin bull Tone Vays thinks XRP can’t compete with PayPal as a means of payment or as a currency.</p>
      <p>Vays, a veteran derivatives trader and longtime XRP <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/07/23/a-heated-debate-on-the-future-of-ripple-xrapid-and-xrp/">critic</a>, recently responded on Twitter to claims about XRP’s efficiency and supremacy.</p>

      <p>Analyst and Adaptive Capital partner Willy Woo also hopped in the conversation, <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1194583254629666816">arguing</a> that Ripple’s success doesn’t necessarily mean anything for XRP.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“It gets better than that. If you’re using the native Ripplenet to transmit funds there’s no need for XRP. I have no idea why people think Ripple Labs’ success or failure reflects in this fund raising token.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The subject of the initial tweet centered on BTC vs. XRP before Vays entered the arena.</p>

      <p>XRP transactions typically settle in a matter of seconds, faster than Ethereum and Bitcoin, which typically settle in a matter of minutes. However, transfer times for both BTC and ETH have stretched to well over an hour during periods of high network congestion.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin can <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2018/04/27/cryptocurrency-transaction-speeds-the-complete-review/">process</a> about seven transactions per second; Ethereum can handle about 15 per second; and XRP can process about 1,500 transactions per second.</p>
      <p>As for PayPal, the company says transactions are settled instantly when people send funds using their PayPal balances.</p>
      <p>However, a PayPal transaction can take several days to complete when users send money using their bank accounts. </p>
