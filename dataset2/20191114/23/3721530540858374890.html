      <p>Microsoft’s game streaming platform, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/8/17950884/microsoft-xbox-cloud-streaming-project-xcloud">Project xCloud</a>, is coming to Windows 10 PC in 2020, the company announced Thursday at X019 in London. The addition of a new platform is part of a major expansion for Project xCloud, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/24/20882522/xbox-one-project-xcloud-public-test-launch-date">launched publicly in preview form</a> — for Android devices only in the U.S., U.K., and Korea — earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The first part of the expanded public test is the addition of more than 50 titles to the Project xCloud preview. The list of new games includes first-party games such as <i>Crackdown 3</i>, <i>Halo Wars 2</i>, <i>Ori and the Blind Forest</i>, and <i>State of Decay 2</i>, as well as third-party games <i>Devil May Cry 5</i>, <i>Tekken 7</i>, <i>Madden NFL 20</i>, <i>Hitman</i>, <i>Ark: Survival Evolved</i>, and <i>Borderlands: The Handsome Collection</i>.</p>
      <p>Project xCloud players will be able to stream those Xbox One games to Windows PC next year, and Microsoft says it’s “collaborating with a broad set of partners to make game streaming available on other devices as well.”</p>
      <p>Microsoft will also expand the input devices compatible with Project xCloud, naming <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-controllers/razer-junglecat">Razer’s Junglecat</a> — the dual-sided controller that makes a mobile phone look like a Nintendo Switch — and Sony’s DualShock 4 as upcoming compatible gamepads.</p>
      <p>The game streaming platform will also expand geographically. Microsoft said it plans to roll out Project xCloud to Canada, India, Japan, and Western Europe in 2020.</p>
      <p>Finally, Microsoft said Project xCloud will support Xbox Game Pass for titles that appear on the company’s game subscription service.</p>
      <p>Project xCloud was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/8/17950884/microsoft-xbox-cloud-streaming-project-xcloud">officially announced in 2018</a>. The platform aims to bring game streaming to a variety of platforms via the cloud and eventually let users stream games from their own Xbox consoles to mobile phones, PCs, and other devices.</p>
