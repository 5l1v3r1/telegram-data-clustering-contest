      <p>Olivia and Bradley announced their engagement last month with a series of adorable Instagram photos.</p>
      <p>One snap showed Blackburn Rovers star Bradley sweetly holding onto Olivia's hand - complete with shiny new jewellery - as they shared a passionate kiss.</p>
      <p>In the other pic, Olivia laid a hand on Bradley's chest as they looked into the lens with huge grins on their faces.</p>
      <p>The couple have been together on and off for four years, and she had been seeing him before her stint on Love Island, where she met now-ex Chris Hughes.</p>

      <p>Just a few months ago, the TOWIE star dropped some surprising home truths about her relationship, including that she didn't completely trust her beau.</p>
      <p>But the blonde bombshell confessed she was happy with some of Bradley's attributes — namely his "massive c**k" and "amazing bum".</p>
      <p>Olivia told new! magazine: "We row about little things, like house-related things. I'm very OCD and he's very messy.</p>
      <p>"I've also got a long way to go with trust. That's my own issue more than his. I don't think you should trust any man 100 per cent."</p>
      <p>The couple met in 2015 but split in 2017 when Olivia went into the Love Island villa.</p>
      <p>They had also previously hinted that they'd get engaged this year. Looks like they were right!</p>
