      <h3>iPhone</h3>
      <p>Starting on Thanksgiving and continuing through Black Friday, Best Buy will host a few carrier deals for the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro. If you’re looking for a discount on an iPhone 11 Pro, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fiphone%2Fshop-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max%2Fpcmcat1568147641595.c">you may be able to buy one for as little as $499 (roughly half off)</a>, but only if you activate a new line with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Sprint, and also trade in your old phone. How much you pay overall will depend on how much trade-in value your phone has.</p>
      <p>A similar deal applies to the less expensive iPhone 11 at Best Buy, which normally has a $699 starting price. After activating it and trading in your old phone, the final cost after your installment plan is paid off <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fiphone-11%3Firclickid%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4TcE3AcTY0%26acampID%3D614286">will be $199</a>.</p>
      <p>Over at Target, the iPhone deals kick off on Black Friday and last through Sunday. You can get a $200 gift card when you activate either the <a href="https://fave.co/2Qn7m2e">iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, or iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> with Verizon or AT&amp;T. Target will also offer a $200 gift card for the <a href="https://fave.co/2O8o2YF">iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max</a>, which cost less per month than the iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max.</p>

      <h3>Google Pixel</h3>
      <p>Starting on November 24th and lasting through December 1st, Target will offer a $300 gift card <a href="https://fave.co/33GeIBX">when you activate a Google Pixel 4 or Google Pixel 4 XL</a> with an installment plan on Verizon or AT&amp;T.</p>
      <p>If getting a gift card doesn’t matter much to you, Best Buy will take $400 off of the Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fpcmcat1566430029496.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1566430029496%26irclickid%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4V0E3AcTY0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DxqBSa%253AVE8xyJUAN0MdV3iVCmUkn1R4V0E3AcTY0%26acampID%3D614286">if you activate either phone with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&amp;T, or Sprint</a>.

This deal begins on Thanksgiving.</p>

      <p>Right now, Google Fi is offering subscribers <a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-3a">a $100 discount on the Google Pixel 3A and 3A XL</a>. So, you’ll get the same prices that are listed above, but you’ll need to activate them with Google Fi. However, so long as you activate it within 30 days of purchasing it, you’re free to cancel service and move to another carrier if you choose.</p>
