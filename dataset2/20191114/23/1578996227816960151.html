      <h1>Meghan Markle Secretly Hosted Hillary Clinton and Introduced Her to Archie at Frogmore Cottage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T23:39:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 23:39</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Archie got to meet another major political figure, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, this week, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7687095/Hilary-Clinton-visited-Meghan-Markle-Frogmore-Cottage-Tuesday.html">Daily Mail</a> reports. Clinton visited Meghan Markle and her six-month-old son at their Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor on Tuesday. Meghan invited her.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources told the outlet that Meghan and Clinton hugged and had a "fan girl" meeting. Clinton also got to "cuddle" Archie, the Mail reports. Clinton talked to Meghan about her daughter Chelsea's new son, Jasper, the outlet noted.</p>
      <p>"Both women have a lot of admiration for each other and it was a very sweet, warm meeting," the source said. "They are mutual fan girls!"</p>
      <p>Clinton's visit comes days after she praised Meghan and called out the tabloids' racist mistreatment of her during <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50387004">a BBC Radio</a> interview.</p>
      <p>“To think that some of your—what we would call mainstream—media actually allowed that to be printed in their pages, or amplified, was heartbreaking and wrong,” she started, via <i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/12/hillary-clinton-slams-british-treatment-meghan-duchess-sussex-heartbreaking-wrong/">The Washington Post</a></i>.</p>
      <p>She agreed that there has been a racist element to the tabloids' smeary stories about Meghan. “I think even if you go back and look at social media from the time the engagement was announced, race was clearly an element in it,” Clinton said.</p>
      <p>"She is an amazing young woman, she has an incredible life story," Clinton continued. "She has stood up for herself, she has made her own way in the world. And then she falls in love, and he falls in love with her, and everybody should be celebrating that because it is a true love story."</p>
      <p>"I feel as a mother I just want to put my arms around her. Oh my God, I want to hug her," Clinton said. "I want to tell her to hang in there, don't let those bad guys get you down."</p>
