      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 15 — Netflix will produce a fourth sequel to <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i>, the 25-year-old franchise starring Eddie Murphy, who will return in the memorable lead role.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Paramount told AFP yesterday that the studio had sold the production rights to the online streaming giant, confirming a report by industry specialist <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>.</p>
      <p>According to the Reporter, Murphy — who starred in the previous three chapters — will reprise his role as wisecracking detective Axel Foley.</p>
      <p>Paramount had previously planned to produce <i>Beverly Hills Cop 4</i> itself but dropped the idea in 2016.</p>
      <p>The first three instalments of <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> — released in 1984, 1987 and 1994 — earned US$735 million dollars at the global box office and propelled Eddie Murphy, already known for his roles in the comedies <i>Trading Places</i> (1983) and <i>48 Hours</i> (1982), to superstardom.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first two films, will also helm the new project.</p>
      <p>The deal is a significant one for Netflix, which has maintained access to various Hollywood studios, while Disney — which has just launched an eponymous competitor streaming platform — exclusively produces content from its own studio and Fox, which Disney owns. — AFP </p>
