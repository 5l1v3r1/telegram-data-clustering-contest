      <p>Revenge was sweet for Roger Federer as he won his shoot-out with Novak Djokovic to reach the last four at the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old avenged his agonising Wimbledon final defeat by Djokovic in July, winning 6-4 6-3 to deny the Serbian the world number one spot in the process.</p>
      <p>The illustrious pair, with 11 titles between them, were both expected to progress from the group stage but Dominic Thiem’s impressive form meant only one of them could join him.</p>
      <p>It was Federer who maintained his proud record of having never failed to reach the semi-finals here at London’s 02, and he can now bid for a record seventh title over the weekend.</p>

      <p>Four years since his last win over Djokovic, and four months since he blew those two championship points at Wimbledon, an elated Federer said: “It was a great atmosphere, a great opponent, here at the 02, incredibly special, I enjoyed it from the beginning.</p>
      <p>“I played incredibly well and I knew I had to because that’s what Novak can do.</p>
      <p>“What did I do differently from Wimbledon? I won the match point I guess.</p>
      <p>“You move on, try harder next time round and hope the luck goes for you. I couldn’t be happier right now.”</p>
      <p>It was a strange performance from Djokovic, who made three double-faults in his first two service matches, dropping the second to love.</p>

      <p>By contrast it was a stunning first set from Federer, even by his own impeccable standards, as he fired down eight aces, hit 12 winners and made just one unforced error.</p>
      <p>The Swiss master, a favourite with the crowd if not the bookmakers, broke again at the start and the end of the second set to wrap up a memorable win.</p>
      <p>He can now put his feet up on Friday ahead of a semi-final showdown with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev or Rafael Nadal, who is now guaranteed to end the year at the top of the rankings.</p>
      <p>“You always play better as a tournament goes along,” added Federer.</p>

      <p>“Dominic has been supreme in our group and put us in this situation, there was a lot riding on the match. I had a clear game plan and it worked to perfection. It was a great performance from me tonight.</p>
      <p>“Am I looking forward to the weekend? A lot. I’m happy to stick around. I didn’t make any plans yet!”</p>
      <p>Djokovic, who failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2011, said: “There was not much that I did right this match, to be honest.</p>
      <p>“I mean, realistically he was better player in all aspects and absolutely deserved to win.</p>
      <p>“He served great, moved well, returned my serve very well. From his end, I think he did everything right.</p>

      <p>“From my end, I was just playing too neutral. I couldn’t read his serve well. Just a pretty bad match from my side.”</p>
      <p>In the afternoon’s dead rubber, Thiem was beaten in straight sets by Matteo Berrettini, who ended his stay in the capital on a high by becoming the first Italian to win a match at the Finals.</p>
