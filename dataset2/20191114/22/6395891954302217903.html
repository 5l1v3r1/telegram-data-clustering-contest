      <p>England qualified in style for the 2020 European Championship, while the Czech Republic, France and Turkey also booked their places Thursday at next year's tournament.</p>
      <p>England only needed a draw to qualify but Harry Kane scored a hat trick in a 7-0 win over Montenegro, and the Czech Republic also advanced from Group A by beating Kosovo 2-1.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo also scored a hat trick, in Portugal's 6-0 win over Lithuania, to keep the defending champion in contention for one of the top two spots in Group B.</p>
      <p>Iceland's earlier draw in Istanbul had already ensured France and Turkey were through from Group H.</p>
      <p>HAT-TRICK HERO</p>
      <p>All three of Kane's goals came in the first half of England's 1,000th match as the Tottenham forward became the first player to score a hat-trick in successive appearances at Wembley - having also scored a treble against Bulgaria in September.</p>
      <p>The landmark night was completed by Tammy Abraham's first England goal, six minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the opener in the 11th minute and Marcus Rashford also netted in the first half to help England to a 5-0 advantage at halftime.</p>
      <p>After a flood of goals in the first half, the Montenegro net was only breached after the break by Aleksandar Sofranac's own-goal and Abraham in the 84th.</p>
      <p>England will be back at Wembley at the finals, with three group-stage games at the national stadium, which is one of 12 venues being used by UEFA in 12 cities across Europe.</p>
      <p>The semifinals and final are also at Wembley in July 2020.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic needed to win to join England but had a scare when Atdhe Nuhiu headed Kosovo into a surprise lead five minutes after the interval.</p>
      <p>But Alex Král curled in a stunning equalizer in the 71st and Ondřej Čelůstka scored what was to prove the crucial goal for the Czechs eight minutes later.</p>
      <p>RAMPAGING RONALDO</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo hadn't scored in his last three club matches after playing with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>But the Juventus forward showed little sign of any problems as he came to his country's aid on Thursday, reaching 98 national goals in the process.</p>
      <p>It was the ninth hat trick with Portugal for Ronaldo, and the 55th of his career for club and country.</p>
      <p>He has 10 goals in seven qualifying matches.</p>
      <p>Pizzi Fernandes, Gonçalo Paciência and Bernardo Silva also scored for Portugal, which can qualify with a win in its final Group B match on Sunday at Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>The rout against last-place Lithuania gave Portugal 14 points, five fewer than group leader Ukraine - which has already qualified - and one point more than third-place Serbia, which beat Luxembourg 3-2.</p>
      <p>FRANCE WINS</p>
      <p>Iceland needed to beat Group H leader Turkey to stay in the running for a direct berth in next year's tournament but drew 0-0.</p>
      <p>Hordur Magnusson came close for Iceland, eight minutes from time, but his effort from a corner was blocked on the line by Turkey defender Merih Demiral.</p>
      <p>The result meant France had already qualified before its 2-1 win over Moldova.</p>
      <p>Vadim Rata fired Moldova into a surprise lead in the ninth minute but Raphaël Varane leveled in the 35th and Olivier Giroud converted a penalty 11 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Also, Albania drew 2-2 at home to Andorra, which hadn't scored an away goal in a competitive match in more than nine years.</p>
