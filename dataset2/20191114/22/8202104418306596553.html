      <h3>Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe is looking to former prime minister Stephen Harper to help increase the value of the province’s exports and open new markets as part of an “aggressive” new economic growth plan.</h3>
      <p>Export growth is one of the signature features of a 62-page policy document, unveiled Thursday in Saskatoon, outlining the government’s plan to increase the population to 1.4 million people while adding 100,000 new jobs over the next decade.</p>
      <p>That includes not only three new trade offices in India, Japan and Singapore — the province currently has one, in China — but also a one-year, $240,000 contract with the Calgary-based “global affairs” firm Harper started after leaving politics.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very real plan with very achievable targets,” Moe said of the plan, which projects significant growth in domestic oil, natural gas, potash and uranium production as well as expansion of the already-surging technology and food processing industries.</p>
      <p>Speaking with reporters after his address to around 300 people at a Greater Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce breakfast, Moe acknowledged that the province has no control over natural resource prices, which have ebbed and flowed over time.</p>
      <p>“(But) there are also things that we can control. We can have an impact on our trade relationships with the 150-plus countries that we work with each and every year. We can have an impact on them buying some more products from Saskatchewan,” he said.</p>
      <p>The international trade strategy, he added, is broadly similar to the government’s efforts in the United States — the main customer for Saskatchewan exports — where it pays around <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/premier-moe-heading-to-arizona-to-lobby-state-leaders">$380,000 per year to a South Carolina-based lobbying firm</a>.</p>
      <p>“This has been a focus of this government, I would say, for over a decade — and I would say it’s becoming an increased focus,” Moe said of the plan, which is expected to be the centrepiece of the Saskatchewan Party’s re-election strategy.</p>
      <p>While it is not clear how much implementing the plan will cost over the next decade, the trade offices are expected to be a $4.2-million line item in next year’s budget. Moe said the finances are based on growth and budget projections through 2030.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan NDP Leader Ryan Meili, who watched Moe’s early-morning speech, acknowledged that growth is obviously a good thing for the province, but questioned that focus, suggesting it should be about more than just increasing the population.</p>
      <p>“The main thing that I was looking for was some understanding that it’s not just about more people; it’s about making sure that people’s lives are good in the province,” Meili said, echoing what is expected to be his campaign strategy.</p>
      <p>“We need to be seeing the investments in what’s going to make us more resilient, more able to deal with tougher times, and more ready to take advantage of growth opportunities when they come,” Meili told reporters.</p>

      <p>The growth plan is the successor to a policy document introduced in 2012 by former Premier Brad Wall, which Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said guided virtually all government decisions over the last seven years.</p>
      <p>While the government failed to achieve many of the 20 targets set out in that plan, Harrison and Moe emphasized that they are not afraid to set ambitious goals and then work toward achieving them with the aim of bettering the province.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan’s population is still below the goal of 1.2 million set out in the 2012 plan, but Moe called 1.4 million people by 2030 “realistic.” Statistics Canada projects a 2030 population between 1.33 and 1.43 million.</p>
      <p>Another difference between the two documents involves financial targets. While the new plan promises a decade of balanced budgets, it offers vague rather than specific targets for a “competitive” corporate tax rate and “further action” to reduce debt.</p>
      <p>The new document also includes at least one instance of the government walking back a decision made in the deeply unpopular 2017-18 budget — the choice to reinstate a $14-million provincial sales tax exemption for mining exploration and downhole drilling.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan Construction Association President Mark Cooper, who has long campaigned to have his industry’s exemption reinstated, said the tax can be a barrier to investment, and the decision could signal a willingness to reconsider other sectors.</p>
      <p>In addition to specific targets aimed at boosting production and sales of crops and natural resources, as well as efforts to increase the “value-added” aspects of those businesses through processing plants, the document also includes dozens of other ideas.</p>
      <p>Those include a proposed “rural tech hub,” the suggestion that Saskatchewan <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/sask-government-ponders-nuclear-power">could be home to a small modular nuclear reactor by the mid-2030s</a>, and the notion of using the Port of Churchill, in northern Manitoba, to ship oil and other products to market.</p>
      <p>The document also includes two new agriculture-focused tax incentives — a type of policy the government has deployed previously — and billions of dollars in proposed new spending on infrastructure, including a pledge to build and repair 10,000 kilometres of highway.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan’s uranium industry found much to like in the document. Cameco Corp. CEO Tim Gitzel said the province’s target of $2 billion in total uranium sales by 2030 is achievable given reactors under construction worldwide.</p>
      <p>Gitzel said the decision to reinstate the PST exemption on exploration will also be significant, both for Cameco and for junior mining companies, as the PST could make or break their decisions to drill in the province.</p>
      <p>Nutrien Ltd. spokesman Will Tigley said “policies that enhance Canadian competitiveness will be key over the next decade,” and the fertilizer giant is eager to work “with the government to find ways to make the ($9 billion sales) target a reality.” </p>
      <p>Meili said his own vision of the next decade includes some similar ideas, chief among them “embracing innovation,” but said the plan does not do enough to address climate change or the “enormous potential” for renewable energy in the province.</p>
      <p>“You’d also see a larger focus on making sure we’re building up Saskatchewan companies and Saskatchewan workers,” said Meili, who will campaign next fall on a new procurement strategy intended to keep government contracts in the province.</p>
