      <h2>The Liverpool defender had been involved in a highly-publicised spat with Raheem Sterling during the week which cost his teammate a place in the team</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:56:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> told of his disappointment after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England's</a> fans booed Joe Gomez during the win over Montenegro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-gomez">Gomez</a> came on as a second-half substitute in the 7-0 thrashing, which secured England's path to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling was not selected for the clash after being involved in a training ground bust-up with Gomez earlier in the week, leading to Southgate expelling him from the matchday squad.</p>
      <p>The Man City forward was in the stands watching on and applauded Gomez as he entered the field, but there were a number of boos around Wembley for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender, much to the disbelief of Southgate.</p>
      <p>"Joe had done nothing wrong," Southgate said. "No England player should be booed when they wear the shirt. We're a team. I don't understand that.</p>

      <p>"Him and Raheem are very close, and the team are very close, so we don't want to see anyone treated in that way. All of the players are particularly disappointed with that.</p>
      <p>“I’m hugely disappointed for him, but he’s got the support of all of us - the whole dressing room, totally united. And we’ll make sure we’re there for him."</p>
      <p>The game had gone so well for England up to that point, as a first-half Harry Kane hat-trick and goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Marcus Rashford had put them five ahead at the break, before Gomez was jeered after coming on.</p>

      <p>Sterling had a row with Gomez in the canteen at England's St. Georges Park base on Monday, which had spilled over from a a tussle between the pair in Man City's clash with Liverpool the day prior.</p>
      <p>But Sterling leapt to the defence of his teammate after the match, tweeting: "To all the England fans, I wanted to leave things at it was but tonight I have to speak again.</p>
      <p>"It was hard for me to see my team mate get booed for something that was my fault.</p>
      <p>"Joe hasn’t done anything wrong and for me to see someone who keeps his head down and works hard, especially after a difficult week for him to be booed when he came on tonight was wrong.</p>
      <p>"I’ve taken full responsibility and accepted the consequence. I felt as though I had to say this, get home safe every one."</p>
