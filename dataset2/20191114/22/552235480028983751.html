      <h1>John Hartson in Alfredo Morelos backing as he defends Rangers star's derby drought</h1>
      <h2>Morelos has failed to score in 10 attempts against Celtic but has 22 goals in all competitions this season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:29:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>John Hartson insists <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> must stay hungry to end his derby drought – but insists the Ibrox striker has nothing to prove despite his failure to score against Celtic.</p>
      <p>The former Hoops hero netted eight times against his Old Firm rivals and praised <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> for his record against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers </a>with five goals in just two seasons.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Morelos has failed to score in 10 attempts against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> – but has 22 goals in all competitions this season, which is almost double Edouard’s tally.</p>
      <p>Hartson said: “I don’t want to say which is better. Edouard is more proven as he’s done it on a more consistent basis. He’s scored in Old Firm games, including a brilliant winner.</p>

      <p>“Edouard seems to have done it in bigger games but Morelos is consistently banging them in for fun and you can’t deny him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if he has more to prove. He got 30 goals last season, a good return, so there’s no doubt the boy can score goals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The fact he hasn’t scored against Celtic means more of an opportunity to stay hungry and want to face them. Kris Boyd had a similar record but only got one against Celtic.</p>
      <p>“Whether you like Morelos or loathe him, he’s back in amongst the goals again.”</p>
