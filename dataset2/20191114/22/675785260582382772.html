      <h1>BritBox recruits Keeping Up Appearances' Hyacinth Bucket for US ad campaign</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: BritBox has sought the help of Patricia Routledge and her beloved character to sell the service to American audiences</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:24:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Bryant, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-bryant/</a></address>
      <p>NEW TV service <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/britbox">BritBox</a> has unveiled its secret weapon to sign up US audiences - Hyacinth Bucket.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up Appearances character, played by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/patricia-routledge">Patricia Routledge</a> , is the star of a new advertising campaign in the States.</p>
      <p>The BBC nineties sitcom is one of the channel’s most popular exports with American audiences lapping up the exploits of the show’s heroine, who insisted on pronouncing her surname as “bouquet”.</p>
      <p>In 2016, it emerged that the sitcom had been purchased by international broadcasters on the most occasions according to figures from BBC Worldwide.</p>
      <p>Subtitled and dubbed versions of the BBC comedy had been sold overseas on 992 occasions - making her more popular than David Attenborough.</p>

      <p>US visitors to the BBC website overseas last week were greeted with ads for BritBox with Hyacinth as the main image.</p>
      <p>Says a source: “She is hugely popular with international and US audiences so it’s little wonder they’ve made her front and centre of new adverts.”</p>
      <p>The BBC have teamed up with ITV to launch BritBox, a subscription service designed to take on US giants <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> and Amazon.</p>
      <p>The £5.99-a-month offering will have hundreds of hours of classic series, recent hits and new shows from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Comedy Central UK.</p>
      <p>Downton Abbey, Gavin &amp; Stacey, Wolf Hall, Gentleman Jack, Love Island and Broadchurch will also be available, as well as shows from the archives such as Cracker, Prime Suspect, Brideshead Revisited, Absolutely Fabulous, Blackadder, The Office and Fawlty Towers.</p>

      <p>By the end of the year, the entire collection of the 600 classic Doctor Who episodes broadcast between 1963 and 1989 will be available to stream for the first time.</p>
      <p>Next year, Channel 4 and Film4’s back catalogue will be added, along with original programmes from Comedy Central UK.</p>
      <p>Director General Lord Tony Hall reckoned subscribing to BritBox is like the days of buying the DVD of a show you had loved or had missed.</p>
      <p>Subscribers will not need a TV licence to watch and there will be no ad breaks or contract.</p>
      <p>The joint venture is being bankrolled by £65million from ITV, while the BBC has pledged to also invest “tens of millions” in new content.</p>
      <p>The first series will be Australian made drama Lambs of God, about nuns living on an island, starring The Handmaid’s Tale’s Ann Dowd.</p>
