      <p>A terrified Plymouth family have recalled the petrifying moment they were almost struck head-on by a motorist going the wrong-way on the A38 near Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Daisy Cooper said she saw her life 'flash before her eyes' as a car <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/live-a38-car-wrong-direction-3540496">hurtled towards her in the wrong direction</a> on the eastbound carriageway - missing her by practically a 'metre'.</p>
      <p>The terrifying ordeal unfolded as Daisy and her mum, who were heading together in the car to Exeter, overtook a tanker which had nipped into the middle lane just beyond the Deep Lane junction.</p>
      <p>As Daisy's mum drove over into the outside lane horror unfolded as a vehicle in the opposite direction hurtled towards them.</p>
      <p>Daisy's quick-thinking mum managed to react in time and move the car back into the middle lane just as the car raced by, avoiding potential disaster.</p>
      <p>That's when chaos unfolded with police cars also racing in her direction after the driver - who Plymouth Live can now reveal has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.</p>

      <p>In a series of messages to <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/">Plymouth Live</a>, shaken Daisy said: "(We were heading) towards Exeter, past the Deep Lane junction.</p>
      <p>"A police car over took us just after coming up the Marsh Mills slip-road but we thought nothing of it.</p>
      <p>"Then it turned off and went over the bridge at Deep Lane, just after the car almost hit us. Then we saw four or five police cars heading Plymouth bound. I’m still shaking."</p>
      <p>Daisy and her mum managed to drive up to Lee Mill before deciding to turn back round.</p>
      <p>That's when they discovered the carriageway eastbound had been promptly shut by police authorities dealing with the chase.</p>
      <p>Cops have now re-opened the road having brought the culprit into custody.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed a woman has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving.</p>

      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police force incident manager Greg Hine told Plymouth Live: "The incident has now been safely resolved.</p>
      <p>"The car was stopped on a slip road near Marsh Mills having travelled in the wrong direction towards Plymouth in the Exeter-bound carriageway.</p>
      <p>"A woman is in custody on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol."</p>
      <p>Other drivers meanwhile have described the moment they almost collided with the motorist.</p>
      <p>Shaun Friend tweeted: "That moment when you see a car approaching you at 70mph on the wrong side of the A38 near Plymouth in the outside lane. No idea how I missed him.”</p>
      <p>Police control room supervisor Anya said there had been a ‘very near miss’ involving a husband and kids, and ‘no doubt’ a few others.</p>
