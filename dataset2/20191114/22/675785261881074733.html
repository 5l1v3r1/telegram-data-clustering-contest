      <h1>Harry Kane's latest England hat-trick continues skipper's path to becoming a legend himself</h1>
      <h2>The Three Lions' captain scored a first-half treble as England made light work of a hapless Montenegro side to secure their qualification for Euro 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:00:33+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-kane">Harry Kane</a> did not want his night to finish.</p>
      <p>The longer it went on, the more goals he scored and the more players he overtook in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England’s</a> all-time goalscoring list.</p>
      <p>Kane started the night on 28 joint tenth with Steve Bloomer and Vivian Woodward, went past Frank Lampard on 29 and then even eclipsed Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney who are all on 30.</p>
      <p>Tottenham striker Kane was substituted after 57 minutes, his job done with a hat-trick taking him to 31 goals in 44 caps and rapidly closing in on Michael Owen in fifth place with 40 goals.</p>
      <p>If they had carried on a bit longer, he could have got a few more because Montenegro were hopeless as they looked, in their red and yellow kit, a bad version of Melchester Rovers who were missing Roy Race.</p>

      <p>It was a night when Wembley was paying homage to some great names of the past to mark England’s 1,000th game and Kane showed that he will soon become a legend in his own right if he is not already.</p>
      <p>But it was also a night when England could get completely carried away, no matter how bad the opposition.</p>
      <p>They clinched their place for Euro 2020, the dates are in the diary for next summer with England knowing already they play their Group matches at Wembley on June 14, 19 and 23.</p>

      <p>It suddenly feels real and will soon be on top us with Euros fever gripping the nation just as it did back in 1996 when football was supposed to be coming home but never quite did.</p>
      <p>But the point is that now England have a world class striker in Kane, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> fielded the youngest side for 60 years with an average age of 23 years and 255 days and this lot have got the world at their feet.</p>
      <p>Where do you start? Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell provided a hat-trick of assists, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alex-oxlade-chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> gave England some much needed drive from midfield and their best player, Raheem Sterling, was not even playing.</p>

      <p>Qualification for major tournaments has become a precession for England but actually performing at them is where the difficult bit starts but now they have a wonderful chance to write their own piece of history.</p>
      <p>There is a buzz about this young team if they can solve one or two key issues like a settled pair of centre halves and the midfield conundrum, although Harry Winks and Oxlade-Chamberlain made strong cases.</p>

      <p>It was Oxlade-Chamberlain, making his first start for England since March 2018, who got things moving after just 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>Chilwell’s ball over the top was brilliantly controlled by Oxlade-Chamberlain who then drilled home his first England goal since June 2017.</p>
      <p>Seven minutes later it was two. Chilwell’s free-kick was glanced home by Kane and then the same routine worked again after 24 minutes as Chilwell put over a corner and Kane headed home.</p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford got in on the act after 30 minutes when Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross was headed goalwards by Harry Maguire, keeper Milan Mijatovic made a smart save and then the Manchester United forward smashed home the rebound.</p>
      <p>Kane completed his hat-trick after 37 minutes as he showed lovely control from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross, turned in the box and then fired home into the far corner. Five goals, a hat trick and it was not even half-time.</p>

      <p>Southgate rang the changes after half-time, qualification already secured and goalscorers Kane and Oxlade-Chamberlain were given an early bath while James Maddison was given his England debut as a substitute.</p>
      <p>There was a bit of comedy in the second half as Aleksandar Sofranac sliced into his own net for six, Abraham got a seventh from close range and then a bizarre moment when Joe Gomez got a smattering of boos when he came on.</p>
      <p>If there is anyone who deserves applause rather than the boos it is Gomez because he has behaved impeccably after canteen-gate. No-one saw that coming and it did take the gloss of England’s otherwise impressive night.</p>
