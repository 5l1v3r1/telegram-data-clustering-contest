      <p>Thursday marked a big milestone for “Grey’s Anatomy”, which celebrated its 350th episode with a pivotal episode that found Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) appearing in court, fighting to have her medical licence reinstated after committing insurance fraud in order to save the life of a patient in last season’s finale.</p>
      <p>As Meredith’s lawyer argued her case, things were looking bleak until the surprise arrival of Alex (Justin Chambers) — and who brought receipts!</p>
      <p>In fact, Alex presented the panel with written testimonials from numerous patients whose lives had been saved by Meredith over the course of the show’s 16 seasons, in addition to recommendations from her former colleagues Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), April Kepner (Sarah Drew) and Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh).</p>

      <p>Presented with all those accolades, the panel decided to reinstate her licence. With Meredith now an M.D. again, Bailey Chandra Wilson) invited her to resume her duties at Grey Sloan Memorial — and she’s back!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://people.com/tv/greys-anatomy-meredith-first-patient-episode-350/"><i>People</i></a> points out that the episode also offered a musical Easter egg for sharp-eared fans: a cover of Tegan and Sara’s “Where Does the Good Go”, which originally appeared in the series fourth episode.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Pompeo opened up about her role in an interview with <a href="https://tvline.com/2019/01/16/ellen-pompeo-greys-anatomy-contract-season-17-meredith-leaving/"><i>TVLine</i></a>, revealing that she’s in no hurry to exit the show after all those seasons.</p>
      <p>“I keep saying, ‘I’m ready to move on and I want to stop the show before the ratings go down,’ but the ratings never go down!” she said. “They go down a <i>little</i> bit, but the fact that we are able to hold our [title as ABC’s top-rated series]   is kind of [incredible]. It’s very cool to have these kind of ratings and be on a hit network show in this [Peak TV] landscape.”</p>
