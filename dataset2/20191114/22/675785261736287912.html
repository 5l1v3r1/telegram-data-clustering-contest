      <h2>Jade almost quit the show in tears after the argument but was talked into staying and now looking back Adele feels guilty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:16:29+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Adele Roberts has admitted she feels guilt for the way she acted towards others on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> including Jade Goody – and so is returning to reality TV to show the real her.</p>
      <p>Adele, 40, appeared on Big Brother 3 in 2002 and had a number of row in the house, most memorably one where she criticised Jade for having a verucca on her foot and not knowing what it was.</p>
      <p>Jade almost quit the show in tears after the argument but was talked into staying.</p>
      <p>Asked about her time on BB3 Adele said: “Looking back, I carried a lot of guilt about the way I acted in Big Brother and I feel like I let myself down and I could have been a much nicer person.</p>
      <p>"I’d like to show a better side to myself this time. To both the campmates in there by treating them better but also to come out and have a positive experience not a negative one.</p>

      <p>“I just think I judged people when I shouldn’t have, I should have tried to get to know them a bit more and I think I probably hurt people when I didn’t realise when I was in there.</p>
      <p>"It was only because I’ve come out that I realised that words are really powerful and you should try and build people up. I just let the game get to me and got too negative and I just won’t do that again this time.”</p>

      <p>The DJ says that her biggest fear going into the show is a lack of food when contestants do badly in trials and fail to win meals for camp.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m just worried a bit about the amount of food. Nobody will give me an honest answer about the food and I feel like there’s not going to be much so when I get hungry I get emotional and I just want to have my little safety toolkit so I can just calm my mind down and not lose it.”</p>
      <p>Adele also says she will quit Radio 1 if they dont move her off the early breakfast slot when she returns.</p>
      <p>She has to leave the house at 2am to get to the studios and she said: “I think it’s probably my time (to go), I’ve had four and a half years on it but it is a good show for Radio One to get new presenters and try them out so it’s a great training ground for people.</p>
      <p>"I feel like hopefully after I’ve had this experience in the Jungle, Radio One can find another slot for me. I hope I can stay part of the family but I think it’s probably time for me to move on now.”</p>
