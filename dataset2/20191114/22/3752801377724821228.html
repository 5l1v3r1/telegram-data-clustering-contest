      <p>A Guinean teenager was shot dead on Thursday by police as he tried to flee a crackdown on anti-government protests in the capital Conakry, his family and a doctor said.</p>
      <p>Alpha Souleymane Diallo, 19, was caught up in clashes and came face to face with two policemen who shot him in the chest, his elder brother Boubacar said.</p>
      <p>A doctor at the Amitie Hospital confirmed that one person had died from bullet wounds.</p>
      <p>The poor West African nation of about 13 million people has been shaken by violence during weeks of demonstrations over opposition suspicions that President Alpha Conde is seeking a third term in office, banned by the constitution.</p>
      <p>At least 18 civilians and a paramilitary policeman have been killed since October 14. Dozens of people have been wounded and dozens more arrested.</p>
