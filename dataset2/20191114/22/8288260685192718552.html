      <p>A dopey crook was caught 'wet handed' when cops found a van crammed with cannabis plants after a drug factory was flooded following torrential rain.</p>
      <p>Police intercepted a van full of cannabis plants that were being moved from a flooded property in Worksop, Notts.</p>
      <p>Officers who were carrying out patrols when they spotted the van speeding at around 10.30pm on Sunday (10/11).</p>
      <p>Two men fled into nearby fields and officers found the van was packed full of bin bags containing 25 mature cannabis plants with a total street value of over £20,000.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old driver was arrested nearby on suspicion of production of cannabis and being concerned in the supply of cannabis.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Police are still hunting the second man.</p>
      <p>Officers swooped on a house in Market Street, Worksop, and found the cellar flooded which disrupted the electricity supply to the attic where the plants were being grown.</p>
      <p>Officers seized one remaining cannabis plant and growing equipment from the attic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sergeant Tony Rungay, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "What started as a relatively routine vehicle stop led to the discovery of a large quantity of drugs.</p>
      <p>"The flooding has had a big impact on the town of Worksop, causing misery for a number of families who have had to leave their homes.</p>
      <p>“However, it appears it has also had the impact of flushing out some criminal activity by halting some large-scale cannabis production."</p>
