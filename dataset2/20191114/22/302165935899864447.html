      <p>VALENCIA, Nov 15 — Three-time MotoGP world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who suffered a fractured spine this year, said yesterday he would retire following this weekend's season-ending Valencia Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Spaniard, who rides for Honda and claimed the world title in 2010, 2012 and 2015, told a press conference he was pulling out following Sunday's race.</p>
      <p>The rider, who was also twice crowned 250cc champion, was retained for next season by Honda but has suffered from poor form and serious injuries this season.</p>
      <p>“This will be my last race in MotoGP and after this I am retiring from professional racing,” Lorenzo said.</p>
      <p>“I've always thought there are four significant days in the life of a rider — the first one is when it's your first race, the second one is your first win, then your first world championship — not everyone can win the world championship, but some of us made it.</p>
      <p>“And then the day you retire. As you all imagine here, I'm here to announce that this day has arrived for me.”</p>
      <p>Lorenzo said that a series of spills earlier this season with Honda led him to consider retiring for the first time in his career.</p>
      <p>“Injuries came to play an important role in my results and my performance so I was not able to be in a normal physical condition to be fast,” he said.</p>
      <p>Lorenzo fractured his spine in two places during opening practice for the Dutch Grand Prix on June 28, bouncing into four somersaults and hitting the gravel behind his bike.</p>
      <p>He described how he was picking himself up off the gravel when he made a snap decision to quit the sport.</p>
      <p>“'OK Jorge, is this really worth it after what I have achieved',” he said. “'I am done with it, I don't want to race any more'.”</p>
      <p>Later he had a rethink and returned to the circuit.</p>
      <p>“The truth is from that moment the hill became so big and high for me I couldn't find the motivation to continue to climb,” he said.</p>
      <p>His Honda teammate Marc Marquez, who wrapped up his sixth top-class world title last month, said Lorenzo's decision was a surprise.</p>
      <p>“It was a surprise even for his teammate because in the team we didn't know,” said the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>“He's a true champion and when he felt he couldn't be at the top, he decided to stop, and this shows his strength of character on and off the track.”</p>
      <p>Seven-time MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi hailed his former Yamaha partner, saying: “Jorge is one of the greatest MotoGP riders of the modern era.</p>
      <p>“We are losing a very important part of our sport, a great champion.”</p>
      <p>Lorenzo joined Honda on a two-year deal for the start of this season, but is languishing in 19th spot in the riders' standings, with a best finish of 11th in May's French Grand Prix. — AFP</p>
