      <h1>Meltem Demirors Is Wrong – Blockchain Is Not Dead And Here’s Why (Op-Ed)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:51:28+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:51</time> by <a rel="author">Cynthia Turcotte</a></address>
      <p>Blockchain took it on the chin this week as several big names in the industry speculated that the technology that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been over-hyped. Meltem Demirors, CIO of CoinShares Group, even went so far as to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/blockchain-is-dead-crypto-geeks-debate-merits-of-once-dear-tech?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">declare blockchain “dead.”</a></p>
      <h3>Don’t Start Eulogizing Blockchain Quite Yet</h3>
      <p>Demirors, along with more than a thousand enthusiasts, investors, financial managers, regulators, and other movers and shakers in the crypto space, were on hand at this year’s Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Elaborating on the demise of blockchain, she explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“After two, three years of spending a lot of money on this and a lot of investment dollars going into this, I think the bigger question as an investor is: What’s the scalable revenue model and is there equity value that’s created in these businesses? And arguably the answer is: not yet.”</blockquote>
      <p>I have an immense amount of respect for Demirors. She is one of the most influential women in crypto and knows far more about its intricacies than I ever will. She’s also taught courses on blockchain strategy at Oxford and is a member of the World Economic Forum’s Blockchain Council, which is why her comments stuck out so much.</p>
      <p>While her arguments about scalable revenue models and equity value with respect to a lot of blockchain startups is spot on, her assertion that the technology is dead is just…well…WRONG.</p>
      <h3>Blockchain and the Dotcom Bubble</h3>
      <p>I’m 47 years old, which makes me not quite older than dirt. I remember the dotcom bubble very well – in fact, I got my start as a web developer right about the same time.</p>
      <p>Back then, investors were throwing money at online business ventures left and right. If your business had “.com” at the end of it, there was a good chance that you could find someone, somewhere to invest in it. Some business ideas had merit, while others should have never seen the light of day.</p>
      <p>When the bubble finally burst, it did so in spectacular fashion. In less than a year, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/24/opinion/the-dot-com-bubble-bursts.html">Dow Jones Internet Index fell by more than 72 percent</a>, and internet companies were dropping like flies. Even otherwise successful online companies saw their stock values plummet, and the Internet was declared “dead.”</p>
      <p>In hindsight, the bubble bursting was a huge gift for the development of the Internet. All of the rubbish projects, fly-by-nighters, and get-rich-quick folks fell by the wayside, and real-world use cases began to <a href="https://twitter.com/_Cardano_ADA/status/1194724604142641153">emerge</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s what is happening with blockchain. I’m not saying the bubble has burst, but some air is being let out, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The “Long Island Blockchains” of the space are slinking away, as are those companies who thought that they could ride the hype all the way to the bank.</p>

      <h3>So What is the Current State of Blockchain?</h3>
      <p>Blockchain isn’t dead, folks. It doesn’t even have the sniffles. The developments in the space may not be as sexy as a cryptocurrency going up 10x in value in a month, but they are happening quickly and in increasing numbers. Published last month, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/understanding-blockchain-potential/global-blockchain-survey/2019-adoption-by-industry.html"><i>Deloitte’s 2019 Global Blockchain Survey</i></a> offers some insights that point to a very optimistic future for blockchain technology.</p>
      <p>The survey polled 1,386 senior-level executives in 10 industry groupings from around the world. Some of the key findings include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More than 40% of respondents in these industries said their companies planned to invest $5 million or more in blockchain initiatives in the next 12 months:Tech, Media &amp; Telecom (49%)Energy &amp; Resources (43%)Manufacturing (43%)Life Sciences &amp; Health Care (41%)More than 40% of respondents in these industries said they were currently hiring blockchain talent:Tech, Media &amp; Telecom (56%)Manufacturing (53%)Life Sciences &amp; Health Care (48%)Financial Services (47%)Professional Services (45%)Retail, Wholesale &amp; Distribution (43%)Industrial Products &amp; Construction (43%)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On a near-daily basis, we hear news about another company implementing blockchain for shipping and logistics. <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3412304/how-governments-around-the-world-are-using-blockchain.html">Governments are getting in on the action, too.</a> The US, UK, Brazil, Singapore, Dubai, and Switzerland are just a few of the countries where governments are implementing blockchain technology to improve public services for their citizens.</p>
      <p>And let’s not forget about China. Just a few weeks ago, President Xi Jinping declared that blockchain technology “plays a critical role in technology innovations and industrial revolutions” and “should be made an essential way and main direction to drive China-led technology innovation.”</p>
      <p>What’s more, the country plans to significantly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-xi-effect-china-to-invest-over-2-billion-on-blockchain-in-2023/">increase its blockchain investments</a>, to the tune of more than $2 billion by 2023.</p>
      <p>Not bad for a “dead” technology.</p>
