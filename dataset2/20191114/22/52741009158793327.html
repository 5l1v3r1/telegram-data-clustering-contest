      <p>LAVAL, Que. — Police in Quebec confirmed Thursday that a criminal investigation was underway after an 84-year-old man died in hospital following an operating room incident.</p>
      <p>Health authorities in Laval, a suburb north of Montreal, said in a statement that operating room employees at the Cite-de-la-Sante hospital filed a complaint after an unspecified event allegedly caused the patient's death.</p>
      <p>Neither the hospital network nor Laval police would confirm the nature of the Nov. 1 incident, but the Centre integre de sante et de services sociaux de Laval said the doctor involved was suspended and later resigned.</p>
      <p>The coroner's office identified the victim as 84-year-old Raymond Bissonnette from Laval.</p>
      <p>"The investigation is underway to determine the causes and the circumstances of his death that occurred Nov. 1, 2019," spokeswoman Dominique D'Anjou wrote in an email.</p>
      <p>The regional health authority said in a statement that it had met the deceased patient's family and was offering psychological support to its employees.</p>
      <p>The College des medecins du Quebec, the professional order representing doctors, confirmed it had been informed of the death and that its investigative body would "take all the appropriate actions."</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 14, 2019.</p>
