      <h1>Thousands of child sexual exploitation victims seek help as grooming reports rise</h1>
      <h2>A disturbing rise in calls to the NSPCC helpline Childline has included children reporting being forced to perform or watch sexual acts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:26:01+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Ellis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-ellis/</a></address>
      <p>Rising numbers of children –some as young as nine – are seeking help after being sexually exploited, Childline has revealed.</p>
      <p>The NSPCC’s helpline dealt with 4,500 youngsters who were groomed or forced in to sexual activity last year, up 16% on 2017.</p>
      <p>Exploitation accounted for more than half of Childline’s 8,841 sexual abuse cases.</p>
      <p>More than a third of victims were targeted online, usually through social media or video games.</p>

      <p>Most said that they were forced to perform or watch sexual acts, or were persuaded into sending naked images or videos of themselves.</p>
      <p>The NSPCC wants the Government to provide proper training for teachers delivering sex education.</p>
      <p>Dame Esther Rantzen, Childline founder and president, said: “Older people need to recognise that victims feel trapped because of a sense of shame and humiliation.</p>
      <p>“They think they will be blamed, but often they are tricked by people they believe to be genuinely in love with them.”</p>
