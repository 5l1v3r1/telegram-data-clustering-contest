      <h1>Sen. Kamala Harris Continues to Flounder in the Polls</h1>
      <h2>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is floundering in the polls – polls that include Iowa – despite strategically pumping the bulk of her resources into the Hawkeye State.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:42:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:42</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Bleau</a></address>
      <p>The presidential hopeful shifted strategies in recent weeks, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/20/kamala-harris-changes-campaign-strategy-im-fcking-moving-iowa/">making</a> good on her promise to “f*cking move to Iowa.” Her campaign <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/01/kamala-harris-crumbling-in-new-hampshire-closing-three-offices-to-go-all-in-on-iowa/">confirmed</a> this month that it was closing three offices in New Hampshire – offices in Keene, Portsmouth, and Nashua – and scaling down her Manchester office in order to focus solely on Iowa.</p>
      <p>“Sen. Harris and this team set out with one goal — to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020,” Harris campaign spokesperson Nate Evans <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/dream-house-kenny-rogers/29625738">told</a> WMUR.</p>
      <p>“To do so, the campaign has made a strategic decision to realign resources to go all-in on Iowa, resulting in office closures and staff realignments and reductions in New Hampshire,” Evans continued.</p>
      <p>“The campaign will continue to have a staff presence in New Hampshire but the focus is and will continue to be on Iowa,” he added.</p>
      <p>Harris has been <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/04/desperate-kamala-harris-making-dinner-in-iowans-homes/">making</a> demonstrative efforts to boost her presence and likeability in the early-caucus state, going as far as “making dinner in supporters’ homes,” as the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-04/kamala-harris-iowa-campaign-reboot">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The presidential hopeful confirmed that she was doing just that in a bizarre six-minute video <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/05/desperate-kamala-harris-posts-6-minute-video-baking-cookies/">posted</a> to her Twitter last week. The video featured Harris baking “monster” cookies with a teen supporter:</p>

      <p>Despite her switch in strategies, the candidate is flopping in the Hawkeye State, falling to sixth place with just three percent support in Iowa, a Monmouth University Poll released Tuesday revealed:</p>

      <p>Similarly, albeit less surprising given her diminishment of resources, Harris is tanking in the Granite State, plunging to just one percent support, a Quinnipiac University poll <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/11/poll-bernie-sanders-plunges-to-fourth-in-new-hampshire/">released</a> Monday revealed:</p>

      <p>Harris has tried to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/04/desperate-kamala-harris-making-dinner-in-iowans-homes/">convince</a> New Hampshire voters that she cares about the state deeply, despite cutting back on it significantly.</p>
      <p>“I’m practically living in Iowa to do the work that is necessary to make sure that I earn the support and have the folks in the caucuses who are standing in Kamala’s corner,” Harris <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2020-sunday-trail-markers-kamala-harris-says-shes-practically-living-in-iowa/">told</a> CBS News political correspondent Ed O’Keefe in an interview this month.</p>
      <p>“It was a very difficult decision. But let me tell you, I care about New Hampshire,” she continued. “We still have folks in New Hampshire. I have spent time in that state. I care about the people of that state.”</p>
      <p>“And we know that Iowa being the first state, you know, you got to be all in here in order to be able to get to the point that we can actually get to New Hampshire and other states later,” she added.</p>
      <p>The current Real Clear Politics averages show Harris struggling in virtually every early primary state, as well as her home state of California:</p>

      <p>Over the weekend, the Democrat candidate accidentally <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/09/kamala-harris-accidentally-highlights-failures-in-campaign-hype-video/">highlighted</a> some of her most significant failures as part of her campaign hype video:</p>

      <p>All of the individuals Harris listed were ultimately confirmed, as numerous Twitter users <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/09/kamala-harris-accidentally-highlights-failures-in-campaign-hype-video/">pointed</a> out.</p>
