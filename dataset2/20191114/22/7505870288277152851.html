      <p>Microsoft promised that the latest edition of the Xbox Inside show would be its biggest yet, and it didn’t disappoint. In order to kick off its X019 celebration in London, the Xbox team hosted a live stream on Thursday that was jam-packed with game announcements, updates on services such as Xbox Game Pass and Project xCloud, as well as trailers for highly-anticipated titles coming to Xbox One within the next year.</p>
      <p>For now, we’re going to focus on the announcements, because there were eight entirely new games that made their world premiere at X019 on Thursday, and we cobbled together all the trailers and details below. The big highlight was undoubtedly Rare’s <i>Everwild</i>, but more than a couple of these should catch your eye.</p>
