      <p>Raheem Sterling has criticised England fans who booed Joe Gomez <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/soccer/harry-kane-hits-hat-trick-as-england-humble-montenegro-to-reach-euro-2020-964296.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">during the 7-0 rout of Montenegro</a> at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Forward Sterling missed the victory which secured the Three Lions’ passage to Euro 2020 after his skirmish with Gomez at St George’s Park on Monday.</p>
      <p>Liverpool defender Gomez was jeered when he came on in the second half, leaving Manchester City star Sterling unhappy in the stands.</p>

      <p>Sterling tweeted after the match: “To all the England fans, I wanted to leave things as it was but tonight I have to speak again.</p>
      <p>“It was hard for me to see my team-mate get booed for something that was my fault. Joe hasn’t done anything wrong and for me to see someone who keeps his head down and work hard…</p>
      <p>“Especially after a difficult week for him to be booed when he came on tonight was wrong. I’ve taken full responsibility and accepted the consequence. I felt as though I had to say this, get home safe every one.”</p>
