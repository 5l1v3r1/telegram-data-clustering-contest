      <p>HUNTS POINT, Bronx (WABC) -- New video shows a group of dirt bike riders who the NYPD says terrorized a police officer at a gas station in the Bronx.</p>
      <p>It happened on Sunday, when the officer approached the bikers who were allegedly riding recklessly in Hunt's Point.</p>
      <p>Investigators say one biker jumped off his bike and ran away on Bruckner Boulevard, and when the officer tried to recover the bike, the group began to circle him.</p>
      <p>The officer then pulled out his Taser, while the rider attempted to snatch it back from the cop.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the bikers rode off, with the officer not deplying the Taser.</p>
      <p>The NYPD announced Thursday that one person has been arrested in the case.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Bain, 20, of Queens, is charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, disorderly conduct, and obstructing traffic. He is not believed to be the man seen in the video trying to take the bike back.</p>
      <p>ATV's are illegal on city streets.</p>
      <p>"First and foremost, the reckless driving of the dirt bikes is unacceptable," NYPD Chief of Patrol Rodney Harrison said. "It's a public nuisance, and it's a danger to the community. So we are going to engage them."</p>
      <p>Still, there appeared to be some discrepancy -- depending on who you ask -- if the officer was being disrespected or if it was the bikers being harassed.</p>
      <p>"Are there going to be people, no matter what we do, that disrespect us? Of course," NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said. "But we are the police. We are not victims. And when they are committing violations or breaking the law, there will be consequences for it."</p>
      <p>But some witnesses said it was the officer who went too far.</p>
      <p>"We have no problem from them," said Manvinder Oberoi, who was working at the gas station.</p>
      <p>He said the bikers were not causing any trouble before police arrived and that they never harassed the officer. He says they just wanted their bike back.</p>
      <p>"They are very nice persons," he said. "They buy food, and they pay us. They no fighting anyone. They buy gas and whatever they...give me tip."</p>
