      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Raheem_Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> has condemned England fans who booed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joe-gomez">Joe Gomez</a> in the 7-0 rout of Montenegro at Wembley following their altercation earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> forward clashed with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> defender in Sunday’s Premier League match before an altercation between the players at St George’s Park the day after.</p>
      <p>Gomez came on for Mason Mount in the 70th minute with sections of the Wembley crowd booing the Reds youngster, with Sterling seen applauding his teammate in the stands.</p>
      <p>Sterling said: “To all the England fans, I wanted to leave things at it was but tonight I have to speak again: it was hard for me to see my team mate get booed for something that was my fault.</p>
      <p>“Joe hasn’t done anything wrong and for me to see someone who keeps his head down and work hard.</p>
      <p>“Especially after a difficult week for him to be booed when he came on tonight was wrong.</p>
      <p>“I’ve taken full responsibility and accepted the consequence. I felt as though I had to say this get home safe every one.”</p>
