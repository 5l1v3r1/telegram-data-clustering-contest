      <p>An Iranian government-linked hacking group has in the last year been using small clusters of hijacked computers to infect a handful of targets that include a U.S. national security firm and a university, researchers said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Iranian group, dubbed <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/apt33/">APT33</a>, is using the botnets — groups of computers commandeered by attackers — in “extremely targeted malware campaigns against organizations in the Middle East, the U.S., and Asia,” cybersecurity company Trend Micro said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/botnets/">Botnets</a> are often comprised of a large number of machines. But in this case, the Iranian hackers are using just a dozen computers per botnet to deliver their malware and get persistence access on a network, according to the researchers.</p>
      <p>The Iranian hackers also set up their own virtual private network with “exit nodes” that change frequently, <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/trend-micro/">Trend Micro</a> said. The researchers say they have been tracking those VPN nodes for over a year, but the group has likely used them for longer.</p>
      <p>APT33 is using some of those IP addresses to do “reconnaissance on the network of an oil exploration company and military hospitals in the Middle East, as well as an oil company in the U.S.,” the researchers <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/more-than-a-dozen-obfuscated-apt33-botnets-used-for-extreme-narrow-targeting/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Anti-MalwareBlog+%28Trendlabs+Security+Intelligence+Blog%29">wrote</a> in a blog.</p>
      <p>APT33 is one of multiple well-resourced hacking groups researchers say are working on behalf of <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/iran/">Iran</a>’s interests. APT33 has vigorously gone after targets in <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a> and “a number of Fortune 500” companies in the U.S., cybersecurity company <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/symantec/">Symantec</a> <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/elfin-espionage-group-focused-saudi-u-s-organizations-symantec-says/">said</a> in March.</p>
      <p>The latest findings on APT33, which is also known as Elfin, shine new light on the group’s infrastructure and how it uses it.</p>
      <p>The Iranian hackers are using their VPN network to access the websites of penetration-testing firms and sites related to cryptocurrencies, according to Trend Micro.  “APT33 also has a clear interest in websites that specialize in the recruitment of employees in the oil and gas industry,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>The group has been willing to take over high-profile victim’s infrastructure for long periods of time. For at least two years, the hackers used the website of a prominent European politician to send <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/spearphishing/">spearphishing</a> lures to companies in the oil-industry supply chain, Trend Micro said. Among the targets of those malicious emails was a water facility used by the U.S. army.</p>
      <p>At least some of the lures APT33 sent from the European politician’s website were effective, the researchers added. Last year, a Britain-based oil company’s computer server was communicating with one of APT33’s servers, indicating an infection.</p>
