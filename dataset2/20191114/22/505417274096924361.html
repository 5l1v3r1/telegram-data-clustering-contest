      <h1>Troy Parrott: Walking Out In The Green Jersey In My Hometown Was The Best Feeling I've Ever Had</h1>

        <b>Troy Parrot is now the third-youngest player to represent the Republic of Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At 17 years and 283 days, Parrott became the youngest player to play for Ireland since Robbie Keane in 1998 with his appearance against New Zealand and he marked the occasion with an assist.</p>
      <p>In Ireland’s 3-1 win over the All Whites at a bitterly-cold, and sparsely populated, Aviva Stadium all eyes were on the Dubliner and he made his presence felt.</p>
      <p>Parrott battled with New Zealand defender Winston Reid and set-up Sean Maguire’s stunning goal. The Tottenham Hotspur forward won the ball outside the opposition penalty area and laid it off to Maguire who hammered it home.</p>

      <p>Following the match, Parrott spoke with great maturity about winning his first cap.</p>
      <p>“I was just delighted to get out there,” he told reporters after the game.</p>
      <blockquote>“Walking out in the green jersey, in my hometown in Dublin, was just the best feeling I’ve ever felt.”</blockquote>
      <p>“I said in an interview during the week that it’s about scoring goals and getting assists and creating chances so.  Unlucky enough, I didn’t get the goal tonight, but I’m happy that I came away from the game with an assist.”</p>

      <p>Parrott, who doesn’t turn 18 until February, said that he felt he performed well on his debut and that manager Mick McCarthy congratulated him for his display. He also isn’t getting carried away, despite the progress he has made in his career so far.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I’ve been satisfied with the strides that I’ve been making,” he said.</p>
      <blockquote>“I made my debut for Tottenham and coming in here I’m making my debut for Ireland. I’m just going to keep trying to do what I can do, train as hard and try to learn off people. Then hopefully I can go far in the game.”</blockquote>
      <p>McCarthy said he was satisfied with Parrott’s performance, and joked that the youngster has everything going for him as he even impressed with his squad initiation song.</p>
      <p>“He can do everything. He can stand up and sing, he’s confident, he can play football, he’s good looking. Where did it go wrong for him?!”</p>
