      <p>Tom Holland’s Spider-Man never really left the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not onscreen anyways. Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481118/shocker-tom-hollands-spider-man-3-will-be-in-the-mcu-after-all">his return</a> and the mending of the fences between Sony and Marvel Studios, which will ensure his place in Phase 4, has been met with widespread excitement and gratitude <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481128/spider-man-fans-react-to-sony-and-marvel-mcu-update-we-did-it">from fans</a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481134/tom-holland-had-the-perfect-response-to-spider-mans-mcu-return">the actors of the MCU</a>. And that includes even Mark Ruffalo. The actor who plays the Incredible Hulk made it clear that he’s psyched about Spider-Man’s return to the MCU, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>I think it's amazing. He's a great guy, he's a great actor, and yeah. I had a good feeling that they would work it out. It's good for them, and I was sad that that it would even… I just can't even imagine, after what we've all done together, like, how you would separate them.</blockquote>
      <p>Like the rest of us (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481743/is-anyone-else-kinda-bummed-spider-man-is-back-with-the-mcu">sans our own Mike Reyes</a>), Mark Ruffalo is happy that Spider-Man is back in the MCU after his brief exit. The three-time Oscar nominee, who next stars in this month’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2484555/dark-waters-review-a-solid-eco-thriller-with-a-very-human-heart?pv=search"><i>Dark Waters</i></a>, clearly thinks very highly of Tom Holland, both as a person and as an actor, so he is psyched that the young star will continue to be a part of this film universe.</p>
      <p>While there were some dark days for many Spider-Man fans back in August when Sony announced that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478387/marvel-and-sonys-spider-man-deal-has-reportedly-come-to-an-abrupt-end">Spidey would not be in future MCU movies</a>, it seems that Mark Ruffalo remained optimistic. As the actor tells <a href="https://www.etonline.com/mark-ruffalo-reacts-to-tom-hollands-spider-man-staying-in-the-mcu-exclusive-136239">ET</a>, he had a feeling that things would work out and that Sony and Marvel Studios would come to some sort of agreement to keep the character in the MCU.</p>
      <p>He’s not the only one, a hilarious Jeff Goldblum also <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478833/watch-crestfallen-jeff-goldblum-go-full-jeff-goldblum-over-the-mcu-spider-man-news">expressed a belief</a> that the situation would work out and ultimately it did. That’s a great thing in Mark Ruffalo’s estimation, for both Sony and Marvel.</p>
      <p>Mark Ruffalo was actually sad that the situation got to the point where Spider-Man might not continue on in the MCU after the wall crawler’s fruitful tenure since <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>. That’s why he is so psyched that things turned out as they did. Mark Ruffalo also brings up a great point and one that many of us expressed when the possibility of Tom Holland’s Peter Parker not being in the MCU first presented itself: how do you separate them?</p>
      <p>Tom Holland’s superhero has quickly become a cornerstone of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And with the exit of Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, Chris Evans’ Captain America and soon (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482818/scarlett-johansson-says-black-widow-gave-her-closure-after-avengers-endgame">probably</a>) Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow, he is arguably the MCU’s most popular character. Like Ben Mendelsohn said, Spidey is one of the MCU’s “<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484339/captain-marvels-ben-mendelsohn-drops-f-bomb-over-spider-mans-temporary-mcu-exit">motherfucking pornstars</a>.” His absence would be keenly felt.</p>
      <p>You can’t extract him after his Phase 3 appearances in the MCU’s biggest movies to date without leaving a hole, not to mention the narrative explanations such a thing would require. That’s why <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481311/will-marvel-try-to-lessen-spider-mans-importance-in-the-mcu">a diminished role</a> for him in the future seems like a real possibility, to insulate the universe should this issue pop up again.</p>
      <p>But for the time being, Spidey is back home. Maybe now we can even see Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo’s characters <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471874/kevin-feige-confirms-an-incredible-hulk-and-spider-man-connection">get some screen time together</a>. We don’t even know when Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk will show up next but it would be cool to see the MCU’s biggest hero hanging out with one of its smallest.</p>
