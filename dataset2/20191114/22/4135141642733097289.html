      <p>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — St. Louis Cardinals outfielder <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/marcell-ozuna-player-stats">Marcell Ozuna</a> is one of seven players who did not accept a $17.8 million qualifying offer from their 2019 teams as general managers headed home following their four-day annual meeting.</p>
      <p>Ozuna was joined by pitchers Gerrit Cole (Houston), Stephen Strasburg (Washington), <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/zack-wheeler-player-stats">Zack Wheeler</a> (<a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/new-york-mets-team">New York Mets</a>) and Madison Bumgarner (San Francisco) and third basemen Anthony Rendon (Washington) and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/josh-donaldson-player-stats">Josh Donaldson</a> (Atlanta).</p>
      <p>Just 10 free agents received the offers on Nov. 4, and their former teams will receive draft-pick compensation if they sign elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Pitcher <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/jake-odorizzi-player-stats">Jake Odorizzi</a> accepted a qualifying offer to stay with the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/minnesota-twins-team">Minnesota Twins</a>, as did first baseman José Abreu of the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/chicago-white-sox-team">Chicago White Sox</a>.</p>
      <p>Using the threat to accept San Francisco’s offer, reliever <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/will-smith-2-player-stats">Will Smith</a> became the first of the 168 free agents to switch teams, agreeing Thursday to a three-year, $40 million contract with the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/atlanta-braves-team">Atlanta Braves</a>.</p>
      <p>Qualifying offers began after the 2012 season, and only eight of 90 offers have been accepted. The others were Baltimore catcher Matt Wieters, Houston outfielder Colby Rasmus and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers-team">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> pitcher Brett Anderson after the 2015 season; New York Mets second baseman Neil Walker and Philadelphia pitcher Jeremy Hellickson following the 2016 season; and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/hyun-jin-ryu-player-stats">Hyun-Jin Ryu</a> last offseason.</p>
