      <p>VANCOUVER — A judge has sentenced a Burnaby man who attacked his father with a hammer to one day in jail and three years of probation.</p>
      <p>In September, a B.C. Supreme Court jury found Robert Alan Carlson, 52, guilty of the June 2017 aggravated assault of his father, Arne Carlson, 76.</p>
      <p>The trial heard that in the weeks leading up to the incident, tensions were running high in the Carlson household.</p>
      <p>A day after a dispute over the repair of a light in the family home, where Carlson lived with his parents, the father was watching a baseball game on TV when his son came into the room and asked what his father was going to do about an invoice he had prepared for the repair work.</p>
      <p>The father was upset that his son, who had been living in the family home since 2005, had presented a bill to him since he had been supporting him for years and felt that the move lacked “class.”</p>
      <p>Carlson later pushed his father backward and hit him twice with the hammer, once on the back of the head.</p>
      <p>B.C. Supreme Court Justice Catherine Murray said that due to the circumstances of the case, including Carlson’s mental health issues, rehabilitation was a paramount principle.</p>
      <p>She ordered Carlson, who received credit for more than 200 days of pre-sentence custody, to serve one more day in jail. He is to have no contact with his parents without their permission and receive mental-health counselling.</p>
