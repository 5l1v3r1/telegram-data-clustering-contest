      <h1>Arrow’s Final Season Has Officially Wrapped Filming</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:45:35+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>January’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/arrow"><b>Arrow</b></a> finale is fast approaching. And today, the show reached a major milestone in its storied history. After eight seasons, production on the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrowverse"><b>Arrowverse</b></a>’s flagship series has finally come to an end.</p>
      <p>The series’ writers made the (very brief) announcement via their official <a href="https://twitter.com/ARROWwriters/status/1195009157352411136">Twitter</a> account this morning. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

      <p>Although filming on the show officially came to a close today, several major cast members have already shared their goodbyes online. Just yesterday, Dinah Drake actress Juliana Harkavy posted her own message to thank fans for watching over the years. Other <b>Arrowverse</b> mainstays, including <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-flash"><b>The Flash</b></a>’s Grant Gustin and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/supergirl"><b>Supergirl</b></a>’s Melissa Benoist, previously appeared in a video (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeLD1Rd5b2M">Entertainment Weekly</a>) to pay tribute to Stephen Amell’s performance as Oliver Queen.</p>
      <p>Amell himself has been addressing the series’ impending conclusion ever since it was announced back in March. Last week, he <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAmell/status/1192315782216081408">revealed</a> that he was getting ready to film his last scenes in Oliver’s trademark green duds. Following today’s announcement, he commemorated the occasion by offering yet <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAmell/status/1194907223698399232">another</a> shout-out to the show’s cast and crew.</p>
