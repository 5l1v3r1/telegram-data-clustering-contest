      <h1>Tobefair looks to beat the weather and his rivals on return to Cheltenham</h1>
      <h2>Owned by regulars of a pub in Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, he has given them plenty to cheer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">MSP WalesOnline</a></address>
      <p>Though the first day of this weekend’s three-day meeting at Cheltenham was abandoned due to waterlogging, romantics will be hoping that Tobefair can continue his love affair with the course on Saturday, <i>writes Jim Beavis.</i></p>
      <p>Owned by regulars of a pub in Cresswell Quay, Pembrokeshire, he won seven races in a row for them between 2015-17.</p>
      <p>He lost his form for a time, but his trainer Debra Hamer revived him this year and he was only just denied in the Pertemps Final by a JP McManus hotpot.</p>
      <p>Tobefair gained compensation by winning a handicap at Cheltenham’s April meeting and another last month. He is now 18 pounds higher than in the Pertemps and is top weight for tomorrow’s race, and though sentiment has made him the early favourite he must be vulnerable to a younger horse with a lower weight.</p>
      <p>Ben Jones rode his second successive Saturday winner on TV last weekend, courtesy of Misty Bloom at Wincanton. The son of Ffos Las’ clerk of the course is attached to the powerful Philip Hobbs yard, but has been getting support from other stables too.</p>

      <p>He told the Racing Post: “I had a treble at Hereford in October, which was a massive help and opened up a few doors. I said at the start of the season if I lost my seven-pound claim it’d be a great season, so I have to pinch myself that I managed it in my first month. I take each day as it comes now.”</p>
      <p>Misty Bloom’s trainer Emma Lavelle praised him as “a top rider of the future”. It’s his 20th birthday on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A sunlit Ffos Las saw some good racing on Sunday. Newtide, Young Bull and Hideaway Vic are names to take away from that meeting. A name to forget is Prudhomme, the 30/100 favourite who sank without trace in the two-mile novice hurdle. At least it left the way clear for a Welsh pair, and Evan Williams’ 10/1 shot Holly James, owned by Dai Walters, came out on top. He gamely held off John Flint’s The Wire Flyer, who was returned at 50/1.</p>
      <p>Five of the six runners in the conditional jockeys’ hurdle were trained in Wales, and it resulted in a second 1-2 for the home team and a third winner in a fortnight for the Bernard Llewellyn yard. Nabhan stayed on well from the rear to take the lead on the run-in, getting the better of a tussle with another Williams runner, On The Quiet.</p>
      <p>Williams had been on the mark at Aintree 24 hours earlier with The Last Day, who won a two-mile handicap chase most impressively. This is one of a string owned by Mr &amp; Mrs William Rucker, who like to bring their horses along gently.</p>
      <p>This one is seven now and is ready to up the ante by running at Ascot in a week’s time. Soft and heavy going suits him.</p>

      <p>In the same colours, Esprit Du Large was a similarly comfortable winner at Exeter on Wednesday in a beginners’ chase. He’s only five and is another for whom the sky is the limit.</p>
      <p>Bangor staged a couple of Class 2 races on Wednesday. Chti Balko won the two-and-a-half mile hurdle to initiate the almost-obligatory double there for Donald McCain. The other race, run in memory of Arkle’s owner Anne, Duchess of Westminster, ended in Graceful Legend beating Arthur’s Gift, a suitably Celtic and mythical 1-2.</p>
      <p>Three victories in the last week were a welcome boost for jockey James Davies – and for the bookmakers, for their odds were 40/1, 33/1 and 12/1. Sadly, Davies doesn’t get many opportunities to ride fancied horses, which creates its own self-fulfilling vicious circle. These were his first winners since May, and shows he’s still good enough if the horse is.</p>

      <p>Racing returns to <a href="https://www.chepstow-racecourse.co.uk/">Chepstow </a>on Wednesday. There are still places available on the evening of Thursday, November 28, when the course hosts the Welsh Horse Racing Awards, which celebrate the best horses and humans that contribute to the sport in Wales.</p>
