      <h1>White House moving closer to forcing greater healthcare price transparency</h1>

      <p>The White House is expected to unveil its long-awaited transparency policy on Friday to force the healthcare industry to do a better job of offering clear prices to patients.</p>
      <p>The policy will put the administration on a collision course with hospitals and insurers who say they plan to mount a legal challenge.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the White House will publish a regulation setting out its new policy. “It’s going to be not only health insurance transparency, but it will also be hospital billing transparency,” said a senior administration official.</p>
      <p>Previous proposals have attracted the opposition of insurers and hospitals who claim it could create confusion and fuel anti-competitive behavior among providers. But campaigners for greater transparency say it will drive down prices and help patients avoid surprise bills.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Fisher, of Patient Rights Advocate, said she was delighted that the White House was ready to act.</p>
      <p>"When armed with the knowledge and information about the negotiated rates and cash prices that providers, insurers, and third-party administrators currently keep shrouded in secrecy, employers and patients can shop for price and quality.</p>
      <p>“Real price transparency and open competition will allow patient choice creating a functional healthcare marketplace — just like we see in other economic sectors like retail and travel."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-to-make-health-price-transparency-a-centerpiece-of-his-campaign">White House domestic policy director Joe Grogan</a> recently said patients were losing out in an opaque system that allowed profiteers to thrive.</p>
      <p>“There's a lot of money flowing through the healthcare system, and unless we get at confronting some of the vested interests that have been making a lot of money year after year on this, the American people are going to continue to be exposed," he told an Alliance for Health Policy event last week.</p>
