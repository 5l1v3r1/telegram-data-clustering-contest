      <h2>The former Motherwell manager has met with Tynecastle owner Ann Budge and her interview panel this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:29:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts have held talks with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stuart-mccall">Stuart McCall</a> and he will team up with Jambos legend Kenny Black if he lands the job.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and Motherwell boss has met with Tynecastle owner Ann Budge and her interview panel this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a>, who is set to become the next Hibs boss, and ex-Birmingham City boss Steve Cotterill have also been interviewed over the past 72 hours.</p>
      <p>McCall worked wonders at Motherwell leading them into a second-placed finish and also into Champions League football.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> midfielder Black is his long-term No. 2.</p>
      <p>Since then, McCall has had a caretaker spell at Rangers and spells at Bradford City and Scunthorpe.</p>

      <p>Ex-Sunderland and St Mirren boss Ross previously worked at Hearts before but as a first-team coach.</p>
      <p>Experienced English boss Cotterill is also in the running.</p>
      <p>He has been out of football since he left Birmingham City last year. He has a wealth of experience in charge of the likes of Stoke, Burnley, Nottingham Forest and Bristol City.</p>
      <p>Former Watford boss Billy McKinlay was also in line for an interview but decided to pull out of the running.</p>
      <p>Ex-Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock’s name has been put forward, after the deadline, but there has been no indication whether they want to follow that up, while Hearts also asked for Felix Magath’s CV but haven’t moved on that either.</p>

      <p>Motherwell boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson</a> is also in their thinking but there would be the complications over compensation and trying to sort out his backroom staff.</p>
      <p>The indication is that Hearts want to move the process forward by the weekend.</p>
      <p>Hearts are also looking to appoint a sporting director but have decided to move their search for a manager forward first.</p>
      <p>Caretaker Austin MacPhee is keen on that role along with Sven Goran-Eriksson, while Preston’s Joe Savage and Lee Darnbrough of Hull City have also been linked.</p>
      <p>MacPhee has been put in temporary charge of first-team affairs until a manager is appointed.</p>
