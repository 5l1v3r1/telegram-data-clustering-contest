      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland-Browns/?tps=1">Cleveland Browns</a> released embattled wide receiver Antonio Callaway, who is facing his second suspension for a possible violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy.</p>
      <p>The team <a href="https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/browns-activate-ol-drew-forbes-from-ir-waive-wr-antonio-callaway?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">announced</a> the move Thursday. The Browns activated offensive lineman Drew Forbes off injured reserve in a corresponding roster move.</p>
      <p>League sources told <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28081034/antonio-callaway-appealing-second-drug-suspension-waived-browns">ESPN</a> and <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001076793/article/browns-waive-antonio-callaway-wr-appealing-ban">NFL Media</a> that Callaway is appealing the league's decision, which would carry a 10-game suspension since he is a repeat offender. According to NFL Media, the suspension stems from a tainted CBD product.</p>
      <p>Callaway, who served a <a href="https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2019/08/09/Cleveland-Browns-WR-Antonio-Callaway-suspended-four-games/2141565401865/">four-game ban</a> at the start of this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy, was a healthy inactive for Sunday's victory over the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Buffalo-Bills/?tps=1">Buffalo Bills</a> after showing up late to the game. According to ESPN, the wideout was late again this week.</p>
      <p>Callaway previously tested positive for marijuana at the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine. He also was cited for marijuana possession while driving with a suspended license in August 2018.</p>
      <p>The possession charge was dropped Jan. 25 and Callaway pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle without a valid license and speeding. He received a fine and one year of probation.</p>
      <p>The Browns selected Callaway in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL Draft, despite similar issues while playing at the University of Florida. As a rookie last season, he recorded 43 receptions for 586 yards and five touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Callaway had only eight catches for 89 yards in four games this season.</p>
      <p>The Browns (3-6) will host the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pittsburgh_Steelers/?tps=1">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> (5-4) at 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday Night Football.</p>
