      <p><i>Rust</i>, the popular multiplayer survival video game that began life six years ago as the clone of an <i>Arma 2</i><i> </i>mod, will finally make its way to consoles in 2020, developer Facepunch Studios announced during the livestream kicking off Microsoft’s X019 today.</p>
      <p>The announcement raises a ton of questions that aren’t yet answered — what will it run like on a console given how challenging <i>Rust </i>has been for PCs? Will it support cross-platform play? And what the heck is Player Review and why are they giving so many testimonials for <i>Rust? </i>A news release from Facepunch and publisher Double Eleven said <i>Rust </i>on consoles will support worlds of up to 100 players.</p>
      <p><i>Rust </i>launched in Steam Early Access in 2013 and Facepunch boasts some 8 million players of the unforgiving survival game, based on <i>DayZ</i>, since then. <i>Rust </i>is billed as a game with no rules, where players must battle the elements of a post-apocalyptic landscape as well as the human nature in all the other players. We’ll see how that goes when it lands on consoles.</p>
