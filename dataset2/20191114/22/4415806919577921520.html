      <h1>Euro 2020 wrap: England, France, Turkey and the Czech Republic secure qualification</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:33:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>England and the Czech Republic both qualified for the Euro 2020 finals with wins over Montenegro and Kosovo respectively to take the top two spots in Group A.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/soccer/harry-kane-hits-hat-trick-as-england-humble-montenegro-to-reach-euro-2020-964296.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">emphatic 7-0 home win over Montenegro</a>, including a first-half hat-trick from captain Harry Kane, earned Gareth Southgate’s side the win that took them through and marked the nation’s 1,000th international.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic did it the hard way by coming back from a goal down to win 2-1 against Kosovo but would have to win their final game in Bulgaria on Sunday and make up a deficit of 24 goals to pip England to top spot.</p>
      <p>England, who face Kosovo in their final game, raced into a 5-0 lead inside 36 minutes as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring after 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>Two headers from Kane, a Marcus Rashford effort and a close-range shot by the England captain put the Three Lions in control.</p>

      <p>Mason Mount’s mishit shot went in off defender Aleksandar Sofranac and Tammy Abraham’s first senior goal for his country wrapped up the win.</p>
      <p>The Czechs came from a goal down after Sheffield Wednesday striker Adthe Nuhiu scored a 50th-minute opener for Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Goals after 66 and 79 minutes by Alex Kral took the home side through to the finals.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick inspired Portugal to a 6-0 home win over Lithuania to keep them on course finish second in Group B behind already-qualified Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Portugal’s other goals came from Pizzi, Goncalo Paciencia and Bernardo Silva.</p>
      <p>Serbia remain a point behind Portugal following a 3-2 home win over Luxembourg as Fulham forward Aleksandar Mitrovic scored twice in the first half to put them in charge.</p>
      <p>Gerson Rodrigues pulled a goal back before Nemanja Radonjic restored Serbia’s two-goal advantage.</p>

      <p>But a second Luxembourg goal by David Turpel made for nervous final 15 minutes in Plzen.</p>
      <p>In the final round of fixtures on Sunday, Portugal visit Luxembourg while Serbia face the tough prospect of a home meeting with group winners Ukraine.</p>
      <p>France and Turkey both qualified from Group H following the latter’s 0-0 home draw with Iceland in the early game.</p>
      <p>The draw also kept Iceland on course for a possible play-off spot and they will look to win in Moldova on Sunday while fourth-placed Albania take on France at home.</p>
      <p>France went top of the group after struggling to a 2-1 home win against Moldova who took the lead through Vadim Rata after just nine minutes at the Stade de France.</p>
      <p>Raphael Varane equalised before an Olivier Giroud penalty with 11 minutes remaining sealed the comeback win.</p>

      <p>Albania led at home to Andorra through a Bekim Balaj goal after six minutes but a Cristian Martinez double put the visitors in front.</p>
      <p>Rey Manaj ensured a 2-2 draw which keeps Albania three points behind Iceland whose goal difference is three better.</p>
