      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/myles-stephenson">Myles Stephenson</a> has been snapped posing with a surfboard during a day out at the beach before heading into the jungle.</p>
      <p>The Rak-Su singer, 28, stripped down to turquoise swim shorts to show off his ripped physique at Surfers Paradise in Queensland, Australia on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The campmate trotted along the golden sand carrying a surfboard as he perfected the ultimate Baywatch-inspired scene.</p>
      <p>However, Myles managed to avoid getting wet as he only went into the sea as far as his ankles - despite being snapped walking out of the water carrying the board under his arm.</p>

      <p>The 28-year-old singer recently landed in Australia ready to swap his luxury lifestyle for camping outdoors, dining on bugs and competing in challenges for food on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>The musician recently revealed he's planning to "embrace single life" during his time Down Under.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner, who split from his girlfriend Love Island's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , earlier this year amid cheating claims, insisted he's not looking for romance in the jungle.</p>

      <p>He said: "I am single. I have just got out of a relationship but I think I want to be single for a bit and embrace single life!"</p>
      <p>In August, Gabby confirmed her split from Myles after reports she'd caught him sexting other women.</p>
      <p>The reality star was said to have dumped the singer after finding out he'd been exchanging flirty messages with other girls on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>Myles' sexy beach debut has proved he is likely to have the attention of the ladies during his time in OZ.</p>
      <p>He will join the likes of Kate Garraway, Caitlyn Jenner, Roman Kemp and Nadine Coyle in the jungle for the next three weeks.</p>

      <p>But his ex Gabby coldly claimed she would not be tuning into watch how he gets on.</p>
      <p>Asked if she would watch him, she responded to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7673427/Love-Islands-Gabby-Allen-admits-wont-watching-ex-Myles-Stephenson-Im-Celeb.html">The Daily Mail</a> : "Hmmm. I donâ€™t watch that show anyway."</p>
