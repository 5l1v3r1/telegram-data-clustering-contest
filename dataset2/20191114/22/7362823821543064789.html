      <p>At the time of the attacks, Warrick worked in landscaping and as a contractor in the D.C. area. He had recently moved to South Carolina, where he was arrested, Montgomery County Police Chief Marcus Jones said, according to <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Potomac-River-Rapist-Who-Terrorized-DC-Maryland-in-90s-Arrested-564929142.html">NBC 4 Washington</a>.</p>
      <p>The FBI said seven of the nine attacks were linked back to Warrick by DNA. All of the attacks were linked to his violent methods, they said.</p>

      <p>A DNA test taken by a family member of Warrick led investigators to him. Officials compared DNA collected from the crime scenes to DNA publicly available in databases, Jones said.</p>
      <p>DC police had offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to Warrick's arrest and conviction.</p>
