      <p><b>1  Olive, Again</b> by Elizabeth Strout (Viking Penguin $35)</p>
      <p>“Olive struggles to figure herself out, and has an urgent need for a summing up: “But it was almost over, after all, her life. It swelled behind her like a sardine fishing net, all sorts of useless seaweed and broken bits of shells and the tiny, shining fish … the billion streaks of emotion she’d had as she’d looked at sunrises, sunsets … All of it gone, or about to go.”” – Joyce Carol Oates, for<i> The Oprah Magazine</i>.</p>
      <p><b>2  Women Mean Business: Colonial Businesswomen in New Zealand </b>by Catherine Bishop (Otago University Press, $45)</p>

      <p><b>3  We Are Here: An Atlas of Aotearoa </b>by Chris McDowall &amp; Tim Denee (Massey University Press, $70)</p>

      <p><b>5  The Anarchy: the relentless rise of the East India Company</b> by William Dalrymple (Bloomsbury, $33)</p>
      <p>“The East India Company starts off really as a sort of pirate operation run by a bunch of ex-pirates in a ship that was originally called the <i>Scourge of Malice</i>. And it on its first expedition to the East Indies to go and get spices, it doesn’t even have to trade; it just spots a Portuguese galleon going the opposite direction, so they board it, move all the spices, and head home.” – the author, interviewed on RNZ.</p>
      <p><b>6  The Body: A Guide for Occupants</b> by Bill Bryson (Doubleday, $55)</p>
      <p>Bryson to Jesse Mulligan: “The one thing I have is this sort of infinite capacity to be amazed by what I’ve learned.”</p>

      <p><b>8 </b> <b>Acid for the Children</b> by Flea (Headline Books, $38)</p>
      <p>“The way I bonded with my friends had always been intense, but with Anthony [Kiedis] it was next-level shit — the spirit of adventure, the street hustle, the getting high, the art, the philosophy, the burning desire to make something happen. Nothing I did freaked him out, and I’d freaked out every friend I ever had.”</p>

      <p><b>2  How To Walk A Dog</b> by Mike White (Allen &amp; Unwin, $35)</p>
      <p>“I read a story in <i>The Guardian</i> a couple of years ago which contained the direst of warnings from the British Veterinary Association about sticks. The spokesperson mentioned occasions when dogs had been impaled, when spinal cords had been pierced, when blood vessels had been punctured causing fatal blood loss … Someone suggested throwing dogs a rolled-up <i>Guardian</i> instead. Someone else then suggested throwing sticks at <i>Guardian</i> journalists. ‘They would consider it appropriation of canine culture and write a po-faced article about it,’ [someone] replied.”</p>

      <p>“At each of these marches, I thought of the people who have marched before me, who have occupied spaces before me: their feet taking steps for change, their bodies on the line, their voices hoarse with conviction. Holding them in my mind as I step, they are the iceberg below the surface.” – Matariki Williams, writing for <i>E-tangata</i>.</p>
