      <h1>Lee O'Connor hailed as Celtic kid provides impressive assist on Ireland debut</h1>
      <h2>The youngster put in an brilliant performance for Mick McCarthy's side as he made his senior bow.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T22:08:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Lee O'Connor might have not featured for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> yet but they could have another exciting full-back on their hands.</p>
      <p>The youngster was handed his Ireland debut in a friendly against New Zealand as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mick-mccarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> 's men ran out 3-1 winners.</p>
      <p>The full-back signed for the Parkhead side on deadline day in the summer but has played only for the reserves.</p>
      <p>But the 19-year-old might have provided his gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> with some food for thought after putting in an impressive performance on his senior bow for his country.</p>
      <p>O'Connor didn't look out of place and showed his attacking flair as he whipped in a stunning ball to assist Ireland's third goal from Callum Robinson.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">Ireland</a> , Celtic fans and the rest of social media were quick to praise the former Manchester United kid for his display.</p>

      <p><b>@AlanRaff81</b> said: "I know it’s only a friendly but Lee O’Connor has been well good for Ireland tonight. Looks like wee have another cracking young right back on our books."</p>
      <p><b>@PaulDollery</b> tweeted: "Given Celtic’s abundant RB options, Lee O’Connor could probably do with a loan move in January. Looks absolutely ready for senior football. Another season of reserve games won’t do much for him."</p>
      <p><b>@jb_8521</b> added: "Having first seen both lads play as 13/14 year olds it's great to see both Lee O'Connor &amp; Troy Parrott making their senior debuts for Ireland &amp; looking confident &amp; composed."</p>
      <p><b>@FutsalFinn</b> said: "Have I ever mentioned that I think Lee O’Connor is bleedin’ deadly? Well I think he’s bleedin’ deadly."</p>
      <p><b>@CelticSean821</b> tweeted: "Lee O'Connor played well here tonight. No reason he shouldn't be involved with the Celtic first team this season. More than good enough."</p>
      <p><b>@shanewhite96</b> added: "Get Lee O’Connor starting against Livi next weekend."</p>
