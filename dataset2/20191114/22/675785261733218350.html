      <p>Raheem Sterling has defended Joe Gomez after the Liverpool defender was booed by a section of England fans during the 7-0 win over Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions made light work of their opponents as a hat-trick by Harry Kane and goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Marcus Rashford, Tammy Abraham and an own goal from Aleksandr Sofranac of Montenegro gave England the victory.</p>
      <p>There was one sour point, however, as some supporters booed Gomez as he was introduced as a second-half substitute - seemingly due to the part he played in Sterling being axed for the game.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez had an altercation in the canteen at St George's Park on Monday, with tempers still high from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> v <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> game on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sterling has since taken full responsibility for that incident and condemned the reaction of England fans to Gomez after the match.</p>

      <p>Shortly after full-time Sterling took to social media to say: "To all the England fans, I wanted to leave things at it was but tonight I have to speak again: it was hard for me to see my team mate get booed for something that was my fault.</p>
      <p>"Joe hasn’t done anything wrong &amp; for me to see someone who keeps his head down and work hard..especially after a difficult week for him to be booed when he came on tonight was wrong.</p>
      <p>"I’ve taken full responsibility and accepted the consequence. I felt as though I had to say this get home safe every one."</p>
      <p>It is understood Gomez was the first person in the England changing room and the first to leave after the game.</p>

      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate also spoke out on the incident in his post-match press conference, saying: "Joe had done nothing wrong. No England player should be booed when they wear the shirt. I don't get it. All the players were disappointed with that."</p>
      <p>Sterling could be back in contention when England take on Kosovo in their last qualification game on Sunday, although Southgate's side have already confirmed their participation in next summer's tournament.</p>
