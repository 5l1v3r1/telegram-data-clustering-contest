      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-dungeons-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/">Minecraft Dungeons</a> will release in April 2020, according to a new (and very brief) trailer. The isometric dungeon crawler adopts the familiar Minecraft voxel aesthetic, except instead of building fully-functioning calculators and scale models of the Taj Mahal, you'll be smashing enemies to bits and taking their loot.</p>
      <p>The trailer also indicates that <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/dungeons">signing up for updates</a> may also grant you early access to the game.Â </p>
      <p>While it definitely looks like Minecraft, this outing will eschew mining and building altogether, opting for a fairly pure Diablo-esque smash-and-loot approach. It'll boast drop-in, drop-out cooperative play, and apparently there won't be any loot boxes or microtransactions. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-dungeons-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/">Here's everything we know about Minecraft: Dungeons so far</a>.</p>
