      <h3>What creature has magnetic teeth? What kind of fish can climb trees? What colour does a reindeerâ€™s eyes turn in the winter? What insect has been trained to solve simple math problems?</h3>
      <p>Find out the answer to these questions and much more in my new book, When Crocodiles Cry: 365 MORE Amazing Facts About The Animal Kingdom (Siretona Creative, 2019).</p>
      <p>When Crocodiles Cry is the second in a series of three trivia books featuring amazing facts about the world around us. The first book in the series, When Sleeping Birds Fly: 365 Amazing Facts About The Animal Kingdom, was my bestseller in 2018 and has proven popular with both middle year students and adults. It was also shortlisted for a Canadian national writing award (The Word Awards) in 2019.</p>
      <p>When Crocodiles Cry promises even more wacky and amusing facts. As with When Sleeping Birds Fly, you can download free worksheets and extension activities at <a href="https://sallymeadows.com/free-stuff">sallymeadows.com/free-stuff</a>. This makes it an ideal resource for families, schools, and homeschoolers to engage children in science in a fun, creative way. The book also makes a great gift for adults and a fun read to have around for your holiday guests, winter or summer.</p>
