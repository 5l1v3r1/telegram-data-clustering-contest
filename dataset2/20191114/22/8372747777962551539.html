      <p>"We will continue to invest in strong, distinctive partnerships for Nike with other retailers and platforms to seamlessly serve our consumers globally," Nike told CBS News.</p>
      <p>While Nike will continue selling its products at other retailers, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/nike-wont-sell-directly-to-amazon-anymore.html">CNBC</a> , Nike is looking to continuing expanding its direct-to-consume business. It is doing so by investing into Nike stores and its app.</p>
