      <p>Harry Kane said the team have moved on from the incident which saw Raheem Sterling dropped from England's 7-0 victory over Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions sealed their place in next summer's European Championships after a hat-trick from Kane and goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Marcus Rashford, Tammy Abraham and an Aleksandr Sofranac own goal for Montenegro sealed a huge win at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Much of the build-up to the game had been dominated by Sterling's altercation with Joe Gomez, but Kane said the incident would now be forgotten by the squad.</p>
      <p>Speaking to ITV after the match he said: "We made a decision as a group. The gaffer spoke to me and a few of the other senior players in the team and that's the decision we have come to.</p>

      <p>"Raz (Raheem) has apologised, as we know, and for us we are a group, things happen and we move on, and this is a great way to show it.</p>
      <p>Kane was then asked if he felt Sterling may feel marginalised by the events of the past week, but he replied: "Not that I know of. He's been good around camp and has been training really well and, of course, he will have been disappointed not to play tonight, but I'm sure he will be ready to go and try to get on the pitch on Sunday."</p>

      <p>Sterling could be set for a return to the team when the Three Lions take on Kosovo in their last game of qualification on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gomez was introduced to the game against Montenegro in the 70th minute when he replaced Mason Mount, and although he largely received a positive reception there was still a smattering of boos as he entered the field.</p>
