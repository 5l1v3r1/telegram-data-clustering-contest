      <p>Earlier this week, Amy spoke out about a recent awkward encounter with her ex-half-boyfriend.</p>
      <p>She was cornered by her ballroom dancer ex at the ITV Palooza.</p>
      <p>She told him mysteriously: "I need to ask you something later actually, in secret!"</p>
      <p>Then they had an awkward conversation about the meaning of the word "palooza".</p>
      <p>After the awkwardness had passed, Amy admitted later she was left fumbling for words when she faced her ex.</p>
      <p>He grabbed me for an interview because he's working the red carpet", she told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"I fumbled my words because I didn't expect to see him. It was a bit awkward."</p>
