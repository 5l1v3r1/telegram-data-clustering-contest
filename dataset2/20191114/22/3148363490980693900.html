      <p>Dozens of pictures were posted to the hospital’s official Facebook page,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/UPMCMagee/photos/a.2631902183543562/2631906510209796/?type=3&amp;theater"> showing</a> a visibly delighted Mrs. Rogers, who was, according to one poster, “as warm as her husband.” She was <a href="https://www.upmc.com/media/news/111219-mister-rogers">joined</a> by Fred Rogers Productions President and CEO Paul Siefken, as well as WQED President and CEO Deborah Acklin, and UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital President Richard Beigi.</p>

      <p>The outfits were the hospital’s own participation in WQED’s “Cardigan Day” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/741208799634656/">celebration</a> of the acclaimed children’s entertainer Fred Rogers on World Kindness Day. In the spirit of the day, the hospital <a href="https://twitter.com/UPMCnews/status/1194758405623361543">erupted</a> in a chorus of the <i>Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood</i> theme as Mrs. Rogers arrived.</p>
      <p>Hospital spokesperson Amy Charely <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/newborns-dressed-as-mr-rogers-at-pittsburgh-hospital-for-world-kindness-day">told</a> Fox News that the gesture was in honor of “the legacy of Mister Fred Rogers’ universal kindness and acceptance” and that dressing babies for special days was “one of the most popular traditions at the hospital.”</p>
      <p>“Mrs. Rogers kept telling us how much she loves babies. She got a real kick seeing them dressed up as Fred,” Charley said. “Mr. Rogers is an iconic Pittsburgher and a lot of the values he represented overlap with the values at UPMC Magee.”</p>
