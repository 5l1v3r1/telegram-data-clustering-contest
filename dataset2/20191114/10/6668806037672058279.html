      <p>After the success of Mardaani, Rani Mukerji is back with the sequel of her cop heroic thriller. This time around, Rani’s character Shivani is stuck in the web of crime in the city of Kota. Based on true events, the film is a crime drama based on the brutal rape cases reported in the city with almost all accused who are underage. Kota is known as the academic hub and has a large population of students which Mardaani 2 digs into for its gruesome storyline. </p>

      <p>Dark, dubious and disturbing, we are shown glimpses the brutality with which a serial rapist is committing crimes. Pale and mundane scenes from morgues and labs, low lit shots from the crime scenes and a generic fade out feel to the film, Mardaani grips you strong with its imagery of the crime. This topped with Rani Mukerji’s intense acting and dialogue delivery is a promising start to what is in store for the audience. The trailer makes you cringe, even makes your heart sink at the state of the country and makes you angry, waiting for Shivani to avenge the victims. Emotional, real and hard-hitting, Mardaani 2’s trailer is a reality check for the system of the country. </p>

      <p>With a plotline that has been time and again utilised in dramas like Article 15 and Delhi Crime, watching Rani bring Mardaani 2 to life is what we are all looking forward to. </p>
