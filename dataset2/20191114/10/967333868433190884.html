        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Children have their own issues with life! This little girl’s innocent outburst on the education system has left the Twitterati in awe, with the video going viral on social media and raking up hundreds of thousands of views and re-tweets.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an amusing narration of her ordeal, a little girl in India’s western state of Gujarat has listed the problems she faces every day because of school and says she wants to get rid of the “troublesome” system. Speaking mostly in her mother tongue Gujarati, she highlights how challenging it is to be a student today.</p>
      <p>She blames the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government for her <a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20191107/1077249141.html">distress</a>, as she says: “Modi ko Iss Baar Harana Hi Padega” (Modi has to be defeated next time).</p>

      <p>​“I want to get rid of this education system. As soon as it’s time for school, I have to wake up early, I am rushed to take a bath, finish my milk, take my bag and rush to school. Alas! I have to bear with subjects like Maths, English, and Environmental Science (EVS) throughout!” says the little girl in about a minute-long video clip which has gone viral since being posted on Wednesday.</p>
      <blockquote>When asked what she would do if she comes across the founder of education system, she says: “I would thrash him and beat him black and blue. Had he (founder) made the education interesting, I would have enjoyed studying.”</blockquote>
      <p>At the end of her outburst, she blames <a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20191109/1077263218.html">Prime Minister Modi</a> for the entire problem.</p>
      <p>The reactions to the video were a mixture of laughter and satire. While some reacted over the girl’s innocuous anger, others showed support for the need for change in the  “stressful” education system. People also tagged the prime minister in their reactions to the video.</p>
