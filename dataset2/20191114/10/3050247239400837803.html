      <h1>Expert: Bitcoin May ‘Crash to Zero’ Because of Institutional Adoption</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:17:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) price could “crash to zero” in the event of mass adoption by institutions, an industry expert has warned.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Cointelegraph’s ongoing <a href="https://dlive.tv/blockshow-stage-one">BlockShow</a> conference on Nov. 14, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pavel_kravchenko_ph_d">Dr. Pavel Kravchenko</a>, CEO and co-founder at Distributed Lab and author of “Blockchain and Decentralized Systems,” revealed a rare bearish stance on the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. </p>
      <h3>Kravchenko: BTC will go to zero with censorship</h3>
      <p>Kravchenko was sitting on a panel focusing on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> projects and their associated cryptocurrency tokens: “Creating token value — are monetary gains hindering blockchain innovation?” He summarized:</p>
      <blockquote>“Bitcoin is censorship resistant money, the first in the world. I don’t believe in institutional adoption. If this happens, Bitcoin will become not censorship-resistant. Then it won’t have this feature anymore and will crash to zero.” </blockquote>
      <p>Institutions’ role in Bitcoin trading and investing continues to form a point of debate among market participants and experts. This year, new offerings have surfaced, with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-futures">Bitcoin futures</a> and custody solutions attempting to woo major players.</p>
      <p>Some have warned about the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-manipulated-before-futures-settlement-dates-research">detrimental impact</a> of institutional involvement, while others are bullish about the future. </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, venture capitalist Mike Novogratz <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-novogratzs-galaxy-firm-is-launching-new-bitcoin-funds">highlighted</a> trading platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> in particular as having the potential to boost, not crash, the Bitcoin price. </p>
      <p>On the BlockShow panel, Matthew Rosak, CEO of enterprise blockchain startup Bloq, added that store-of-value use case for Bitcoin was furthering the appeal of the industry as a whole.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin as a store-of-value continues to be a freight train of momentum,” he said.</p>
      <p>Conversely, Kravchenko argued governments trying to ban Bitcoin altogether would help the price more than institutional acceptance. As a currency, Bitcoin must attempt to become more private — and introduce anonymizing features such as those in Zcash or Monero — or it will lose its censorship resistance feature, he added.</p>
