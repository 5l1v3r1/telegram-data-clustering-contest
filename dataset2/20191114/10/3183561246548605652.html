      <p>Beleaguered as <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/a-new-uncharted-director-has-entered-the-arena">Travis Knight’s <i>Uncharted</i> is at this point</a>, the project’s still chugging along at a clip and the movie’s just found its newest star (don’t worry, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/ben-mendelsohn-dunking-on-every-marvel-hero-thats-not-spider-man-is-exactly-what-we-needed-today">Tom Holland</a> is still attached): Mark Wahlberg. You know him from the underwear ads and the <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/12/bumblebee-will-restore-your-faith-in-the-transformers-franchise"><i>Transformers</i></a> franchise.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mark-wahlberg-talks-join-tom-holland-uncharted-1254555">the Hollywood Reporte</a>r, Wahlberg is in final negotiations to join <i>Uncharted</i>’s cast as Victor Sullivan (aka “Sully”), who, in the games, acts as a kind of father figure to Nathan Drake (who’s being portrayed by Holland.)</p>
      <p>Wahlberg’s casting...tracks, kinda? Sully’s squarely in the actor’s wheelhouse in terms of playing a somewhat grizzled father figure who get involved in larger-than-life nonsense (see: <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/03/transformers-producer-hints-that-maybe-no-one-learned-anything-from-bumblebee-after-all"><i>Transformers</i></a>). What remains to be seen is what Wahlberg is going to end up bringing to the table in this film that’s not technically testosterone <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/not-only-is-a-tomb-raider-sequel-happening-somehow-ben-wheatley-is-directing-it"><i>Tomb Raider</i></a>, but, well, isn’t it?</p>
      <p>Wahlberg also has <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/04/the-six-billion-dollar-man-movie-with-mark-wahlberg-is-back-on"><i>The Six Billion Dollar Man</i></a> lined up; <i>Uncharted</i> hits theatres December 18, 2020.</p>
