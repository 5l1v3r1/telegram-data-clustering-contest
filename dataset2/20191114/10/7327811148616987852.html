      <p>CYPRESS HILLS, Brooklyn (WABC) -- At least one person is in police custody in Brooklyn after shots were fired outside a delicatessen.</p>
      <p>The gunfire erupted following a dispute near Nichols Avenue and Fulton Street in Cypress Hills just before 2 a.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Officers from the 75th precinct, who were on patrol at the time, found themselves in the middle of a hail of bullets coming from the corner deli as they arrived on the scene.</p>
      <p>At first they thought someone might be shooting at them.</p>
      <p>That prompted a big response from the NYPD, including armored vehicles and police in full tactical gear.</p>
      <p>Even the police helicopter was deployed.</p>

      <p>Investigators now believe this had something to do with a prior argument at the deli, and that someone may have threatened to come back and shoot the place up.</p>
      <p>Video from the scene shows a man in handcuffs being taken into custody.</p>
      <p>There is an NYPD security camera mounted on a pole right in front of the deli.</p>
      <p>Police will be checking to see if it captured images that will help with their investigation.</p>
