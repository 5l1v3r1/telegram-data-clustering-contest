      <h1>Motorola Razr flip-phone relaunches - but it's 3 times the price of 2004 version</h1>
      <h2>Motorola has launched a new version of its Motorola Razr smartphone - 15 years after the original flip-phone first launched</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:01:55+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>It was one of the must-have phones of the early 2000s, and now 15 years after it was first released, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/motorola-inc">Motorola </a>Razr is back.</p>
      <p>The retro <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/smartphones">phone </a>was known for its flip-out screen, and was even featured in several TV programmes and films, including Lost, Entourage and The Devil Wears Prada.</p>
      <p>Now, Motorola has launched a new version, which features a more modern-take on the classic flip design.</p>
      <p>While the original version featured a screen on one side of the fold and a keyboard on the other, the 2019 version features a foldable screen, which spans the entire length of the smartphone.</p>
      <p>In a statement about the smartphone, Motorola said: “razr transforms an industry challenge into an engineering breakthrough.</p>

      <p>“The zero-gap hinge allows razr to close with both sides perfectly flush, a cohesive design that also protects the main display."</p>
      <p>The smartphone is very compact when folded down, but opens out to reveal a 6.2-inch Flex View display.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the front of the smartphone features a 2.7-inch touchscreen display, where you can play music, take selfies and see notifications, without opening the phone.</p>

      <p>In terms of cameras, the razr features a 16MP rear camera, and a 5MP front camera, as well as a host of camera features, including Portrait Mode, Night Vision mode and Smart Composition.</p>
      <p>Other key features include water repellency, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 processor, and up to 28 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p>
      <p>While it’s likely to appeal to fans of retro tech, the 2019 Razr is significantly more expensive than the 2004 version.</p>
      <p>The original Razr retailed for just less than £500, while this year’s edition costs a whopping $1,500 £1,166!</p>
