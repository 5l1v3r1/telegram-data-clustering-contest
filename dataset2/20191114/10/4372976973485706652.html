      <p>In April, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/04/15/buick-encore-gx-auto-shanghai/">Buick revealed the Encore GX</a> at Auto Shanghai. At the time, we thought there was a chance the slightly larger GX would supplant the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/buick/encore/">Encore</a> in the U.S. By August, we learned that wouldn't happen, the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/08/08/buick-encore-gx-three-cylinder-engines/">Encore GX slotting into the lineup</a> between the Encore and the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/buick/envision/">Envision</a>. With nearly $8,000 between the starting prices of the Encore and the Envision, there'd be plenty of room for the GX to find a good home leaving plenty of MSRP daylight between the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/crossover/">crossover</a> bookends. That doesn't appear to be what's happened, though. <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/2020-buick-encore-gx-prices-are-up-to-800-cheaper-than-encores"><i>CarsDirect</i> got hold of</a> an early order guide for the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/buick/encore+gx/">Encore GX</a>, and writes that the Encore GX in Preferred trim will cost $24,100 before a $995 destination charge, totaling $25,095. That's $900 more than the entry-level Encore in 1SV trim, but $500 less than the Encore in comparable Preferred trim.   </p>
      <p>The Encore offers an intermediate Sport Touring trim between Preferred and top-level Essence trims. The Encore GX will come in an intermediate Select trim, which CarsDirect didn't mention a price for. Stepping up to the top Essence variant with front-wheel drive costs $29,495 for the Encore GX, $800 less than a similar Encore, which costs $30,295.  </p>
      <p>If these are the figures that show up on <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealer</a> lots, the Encore GX seems like a no-brainer. The Encore rides on an older <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">GM</a> platform called GEM, for Global Emerging Markets, the GX model is built on GM's new VSS-F architecture. Both are fine looking vehicles, but the GX is a little more handsome. The Encore offers one engine, a 1.4-liter four-cylinder with 138 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque, shifting through a six-speed transmission. The base engine on the Encore GX will be a 1.2-liter turbocharged three-cylinder with an estimated 137 hp and 166 lb-ft, shifting through a CVT. The second GX engine is a 1.3-liter turbocharged three-cylinder with an estimated 155 hp and 174 lb-ft, optional on the front-wheel drive Select and Essence trims, standard on every all-wheel-drive model. That more powerful motor shifts through a nine-speed automatic. </p>
      <p>As if all that weren't enough, the GX's reason for being is that it offers more room. An additional three inches in length provides an extra 4.7 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row. The GX wins on safety, too, coming standard with tech like forward collision alert, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency braking. On the Encore, even in Preferred trim, the first three features require the $940 Safety Package II. The last feature can't be had on the smaller Encore. </p>
      <p>There's still plenty to find out about the Encore GX, such as the price to option up to the larger engine, so we'll need to see what the completed puzzle looks like. Based on early intel for the entry-level merits, however, the Encore could find itself living in permanent shade next year.</p>
