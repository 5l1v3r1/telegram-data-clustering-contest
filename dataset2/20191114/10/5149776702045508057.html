      <p>Nottingham Forest’s Premier League losses have been revealed in new figures.</p>
      <p>The Reds have spent five seasons in the Premier League since its formation for the 1992-93 season, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/huge-financial-reasons-nottingham-forest-2908077">last appearing in the top-flight in 1999.</a></p>
      <p>And during that time in the first tier of English football they are said to have made a modest loss of £3.9m.</p>
      <p>New figures from website <a href="https://twitter.com/KieranMaguire/status/1194874953906184192">PriceOfFootball</a> show that Forest’s total is the second smallest loss across all clubs to have featured in the Premier League from 1993 to 2018.</p>
      <p>Wimbledon made the smallest loss of just £1.4m.</p>
