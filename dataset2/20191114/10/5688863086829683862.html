        <b>Amidst heavy links with a move away to Bayern Munich, Chelsea starlet Callum Hudson-Odoi has revealed that Frank Lampard convinced him to stay at Stamford Bridge. The club has flourished under the Blues legend with Chelsea going into the international break amongst the top four Premier League sides.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was incessantly linked with a move to Germany with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bayern_munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/borussia_dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> huge favourites to land the youngster. Not only that, Callum Hudson-Odoi had suitors in England, Spain, and France but the teenage starlet eventually opted to stay in London with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a>. That came via a five-year deal worth around £120,000 a week wages and the promise of a first-team spot after he recovered from his torn Achilles.</p>
      <p>However, now in an interview, the 19-year-old winger has admitted that new Chelsea manager <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/frank_lampard">Frank Lampard</a> convinced him to stay and reject Bayern Munich with the Bavarians heavily linked with a move. Hudson-Odoi also added that Lampard admitted he believes that the Chelsea starlet has the talent and skill to become a great player but he (Hudson-Odoi) needs to work hard to reach that level.</p>
      <p>"It took one conversation for Lampard to convince me to sign. I can't say exactly what he said but he just said he believes in me, he wants me to work hard and if I believe in myself then he believes in me and things will go well for me at this club. And he wants me to play for him. They were encouraging signs for me that you want to hear from a manager, that he believes in you and he has faith in you, that you can become a good player and achieve a lot of stuff at the club,” said the 19-year-old reports the Evening Standard.</p>
      <p>"I was excited. It was exciting times that a new manager was coming in and also you know that he will play at least some of the youth boys as well.  So it's good to know that you are going to play with some of the players from before. I said from the start that I made the right decision to stay at Chelsea. I've been there all my life. I've loved the club from day one."</p>
      <p>Lampard’s arrival has brought about an enforced change to the club and Chelsea look a brand-new side. Not only that but the Blues have flourished and are sitting in the top four with the former Derby County boss transforming things. Lampard’s use of the club’s academy to help them wade through a transfer ban has been lauded and Hudson-Odoi went on to admit that it’s been fun to play alongside his youth academy teammates.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy to be around the boys. Obviously the academy boys who have come through are playing loads of games. It's just a good bond. Great to be around each other. I'm really happy that I stayed. I just want to keep working hard for the team and achieve something with the club. We've all got a great bond coming from the academy and having that good spirit. I think all of us like being around each other.  Sometimes we will stick with each other, we all chill with each other, play games with each other but with England you've got to have a bond with everybody,” concluded the starlet.</p>
