      <p>The UK went into 'purdah' after the general election campaign officially began.</p>
      <p>But what does that mean?</p>
      <p>The term is used to describe the period between the election announcement and the date the election is held. Civil servants are given official guidance by the Cabinet Office on the rules they must follow in relation to Government business during this time.</p>
      <h3>What happens during that period?</h3>
      <p>A ban is imposed on promotional material produced by central and local government that could affect how people vote.</p>
      <h3>What’s the point of doing it?</h3>
      <p>To block any new or controversial government initiatives that could be seen to be advantageous to any candidates or parties in the forthcoming election, or which may commit any incoming new administration to policies which it wouldn’t support.</p>
      <h3>When exactly did purdah start for the forthcoming election?</h3>
      <p>The pre-election period started at midnight (00:01hrs) on Wednesday November 6.</p>
      <h3> </h3>
      <h3>Does purdah affect the media?</h3>
      <p>Purdah does not affect the media at all. There are strict rules that apply to television and radio broadcasters, but these are separate to purdah.</p>
      <p>Rules that apply to broadcasters include a requirement to list every candidate standing in a constituency when reporting about that constituency.</p>
      <h3>Purdah is an interesting sounding word. What is its literal meaning and where does it come?</h3>
      <p>It comes from the Persian word “purdah” meaning “curtain” or “veil”, which means the ensuring of women’s modesty from the world of men.</p>
