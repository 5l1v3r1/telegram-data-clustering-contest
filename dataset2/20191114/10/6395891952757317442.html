      <p><b>ZAGREB, CroatiaÂ (AP)</b> - Croatia's government says the European Union nation will hold a presidential election on Dec. 22.</p>
      <p>The government formally set the date Thursday for the vote seen as a test of popularity for the ruling conservatives.</p>
      <p>President Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic is seeking a second term, and will be challenged by former left-leaning Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic.</p>
      <p>Grabar Kitarovic enjoys the support of the governing Croatian Democratic Union, while Milanovic is the candidate of the main opposition Social Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>Also is the race are singer Miroslav Skoro and a former judge Mislav Kolakusic, who has gathered support pledging to fight corruption.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls have shown Grabar Kitarovic as the favorite but suggest no candidate will win an outright victory. If that happens, a presidential runoff vote will be held on Jan. 5.</p>
