      <p>At least six people were wounded in the blast, but their injuries were not severe, national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The explosion also damaged three police vehicles and one private vehicle.</p>
      <p>Indonesian authorities have <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/medan-suicide-bomb-suspect-lone-wolf-indonesia-police-12090202">identified the attacker as a 24-year-old student, describing him as a "lone wolf"</a>.</p>
      <p>The man wore an explosive device on his body, with authorities recovering nails, an on-off switch button, cables and body parts at the scene of the blast, Prasetyo said.</p>
      <p>The motive for the attack was not immediately known, but police stations have been frequent targets for radicals in the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.</p>
