      <h1>Roman Abramovich's role as Chelsea launch new RAF partnership in fight against antisemitism</h1>
      <h2>The club is continuing its fight to combat the rise in hate crimes</h2>

      <p>The Chelsea Foundation will next month launch a Hidden Heroes appeal in conjunction with the RAF Museum, asking Jewish veterans, their children and grandchildren to share their wartime stories for a project that will coincide with the Battle of Britain's 80th anniversary next year.</p>
      <p>The idea to partner with the museum was Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's, according to chairman Bruce Buck, and the partnership will be unveiled at next month's Premier League game at home to Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>That game will be attended by a number of Jewish RAF veterans who will have dinner before the game in a private box before sharing their experiences.</p>
      <p>The partnership will fall under Chelsea's Say No to Antisemitism campaign, which was founded in January 2018 to raise awareness in the face of a number of incidents within the game.</p>
      <p>“With the power of football, the power of sport, we can help publicise this project," <a href="https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/chelsea-and-raf-project-to-tell-untold-stories-of-jewish-hidden-heroes-2/">Buck said</a>. "Just like the Holocaust survivors, the RAF veterans are also getting quite old now. Hopefully we can find a few stories that are hidden.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of our efforts in fighting antisemitism, and we hope that with all of our activities over the long term, that we will be able to move the needle a bit."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Chelsea were honoured at the #No2H8 Crime Awards for their work against antisemitism. The club says that it is determined to ensure everyone feels safe, valued and included at football matches.</p>
      <p>In May they played New England Revolution in a friendly in Boston that was criticised for its timing but raised about £4million that was distributed to 16 organisations that combat antisemitism and discrimination.</p>
