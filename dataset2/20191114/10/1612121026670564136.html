      <p>Although Sony’s smartphone division isn’t performing well with sales down 32% in the third quarter, the company is moving full steam ahead with flagships. Following both the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/xperia-1/">Xperia 1</a> and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/xperia-5/">Xperia 5</a>, the Xperia 3 will be its latest high-end device, sporting an interesting curved back with a flat screen. 5G support will also be onboard. The curved design is reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/xperia-arc/">Xperia Arc</a> from way back in 2011.</p>

      <p>The processor is expected to be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 856 and the OLED screen will have the CinemaWide 21:9 aspect ratio like their recent devices. Whether or not it’s upgraded to a 90Hz panel for faster refresh rates remains to be seen. There will be three cameras as well, but additional specs are still unknown.</p>
