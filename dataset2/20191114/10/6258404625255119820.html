      <p>Ford's first efforts with an all-electric vehicle -- the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/focus-electric">Focus Electric</a> -- wasn't exactly a hit with the buying public. However, the company is looking improve greatly upon that compromised vehicle with the launch of it first vehicle that was <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/ford-mustang-inspired-mach-1-electric-crossover-300-mile-range">designed from the ground-up to be electric</a>.</p>
      <p>Today, that vehicle has a name: <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/ford-mustang-inspired-ev-crossover-november-17">Mustang Mach-E</a>. The Mach-E portion of the name is not surprising given previous reports, but it is interesting to see that <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/ford">Ford</a> is actually using the Mustang name to market the vehicle. The Mustang Mach-E might draw inspiration from its namesake, but the Mustang name has always been applied to two-door coupes, fastbacks, and convertibles.</p>

      <p>How will the Mustang faithful react to the storied name being applied to a four-door electric crossover that will probably be pushing close to 5,000 pounds? That remains to be seen, but Ford is most definitely <i>amped</i> about the prospects of this vehicle.</p>

      <p>Ford says that it will officially unveil the Mustang Mach-E at an event in Los Angeles on November 17<sup>th</sup>. The event will be live-streamed on YouTube, and actor Idris Elba will be on hand to help launch the vehicle. According to Ford, it will open preorders for the Mustang Mach-E at 9:30pm ET and will be accepting $500 refundable deposits.</p>

      <p>The render at the top of this article is based on CAD leaks and test mules that have been <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-ford-mustang-inspired-suv-caught-almost-tot-1839701061">spied running around Dearborn</a>, Michigan. It definitely has muscular good looks, and the back of the vehicle in particular takes clear inspiration from the Mustang.</p>

      <p>Although Ford hasn't revealed any specifications for the vehicle, rumors suggest that the Mustang Mach-E will have a driving range in excess of 315 miles with its largest battery pack and will be available in rear-wheel drive (single motor) and all-wheel drive (dual motor) configurations. Given that <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/mustang">Mustang</a> pedigree, we're hoping that the vehicle has the performance to match.</p>
      <p>As for pricing, it said that the Mustang Mach-E could possibly cross the $60,000 threshold for high-performance versions, which would put it on par with the compact Tesla <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/model-y">Model Y</a>.<br/><br/><i>(Renders included in this article are <a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/we-digitally-reveal-the-2021-mach-e-from-latest-spy-pics.39/">courtesy of the Mach-E Forum</a>)</i></p>
