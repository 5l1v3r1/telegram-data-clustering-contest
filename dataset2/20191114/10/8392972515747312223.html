      <p>It comes after it was reported that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/harry-and-meghan-have-told-the-queen-they-wont-be-spending-archies-first-christmas-with-her/">the couple are spending Archie's first Christmas with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland</a>.</p>
      <p>The family were reportedly originally due to head to the States for a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/meghan-and-prince-harry-plan-to-take-six-weeks-off-before-christmas/">six-week break</a> from the limelight.</p>

      <p>It was thought they would spend Archie's first Thanksgiving in his mother's homeland, before heading back to his father's for his first Christmas.</p>
      <p>However, it's now been said that the couple will stay in Los Angeles rather than at Sandringham.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10333855/harry-meghan-decline-queen-sandringham-invitation/">The Sun</a> the pair have declined the Queen's invite to her Norfolk estate.</p>

      <p>The insider told the publication: "They need some time away to recharge and decide their plans for next year."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, royal biographer Ingrid Seward added that Christmas at Sandringham can be "quite stressful" and the couple may not want to go with Archie at such a young age.</p>
      <p>She said: "I think it’s sad they don’t want to be part of the family gathering, particularly now the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are in their dotage.</p>
      <p>"The Queen might be a little hurt but she’s far too gracious to ever let it show or be known."</p>
