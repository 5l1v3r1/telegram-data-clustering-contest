      <p>The act of annoying a police officer could become a crime in a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-york">New York</a> county.</p>
      <p>Under a proposal approved by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/monroe-county">Monroe County</a> Legislature, anyone who annoys, alarms or threatens the personal safety of an officer could face up to a year in jail and up to a $5,000 (£3,891) fine.</p>
      <p>The measure was passed 17-10 on Tuesday and will also apply to first responders.</p>
      <p>The county executive will now hold a public hearing and decide whether to pass it into law.</p>
      <p>However, civil rights groups have warned the bill could have a chilling effect on interactions between the police and the public.</p>
      <p>“Members of the community have every right to challenge police officers, particularly those that engage in unnecessary behaviour,” Iman Abid, a spokesperson for the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>“At a time when more accountability of police departments is needed, this law takes us incredibly backward.”</p>
      <p>A news release about the legislation mentioned people throwing water over uniformed NYPD officers.</p>
      <p>Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at the John Lay College of Criminal Justice, said the statue was overbroad and unconstitutionally vague.</p>
      <p>She warned officers could be “annoyed” by a person who asks for their badge number or records their actions on a phone.</p>
