      <h1>Uncharted movie finds its Sully in Mark Wahlberg</h1>

      <p>The headline alone should give away how long the Uncharted movie has been floating around Hollywood waiting for it to be shot. Way back when Mark Wahlberg was meant to be taking the role of Nathan Drake but now Variety is reporting that the Hollywood actor will now instead be taking on the role Victor “Sully” Sullivan instead. It was previously confirmed Tom Holland would be taking the role of a young Nathan Drake. Wahlberg was going to be Drake in David O. Russell’s version of the movie, though that was scrapped as people weren’t happy with the direction the movie was taking.</p>
      <p>Travis Knight, director of Bumblebee, is the current person who is putting together the Uncharted movie but with the rate at which directors keep getting replaced it is no guarantee he’ll be there at the end. After all, Seth Gordon, Dan Trachtenberg, and Shawn Levy have all been linked to the movie at some point. The movie’s plot is to be a prequel to the game series which gives some freedom to the production team though whether they’ll reference any of Drake’s childhood will remain to be seen.</p>
      <p>The Uncharted movie is scheduled to be released at the end of 2020, though that could also change.</p>
