      <p>Let me tell you, I am on tenterhooks for Lizardcube's <i>Streets of Rage 4</i>. The various <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../dotemu-confirms-yuzo-koshiro-for-streets-of-rage-4-soundtrack-561070.phtml">teases</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../streets-of-rage-4-with-hand-drawn-visuals-announced-520137.phtml">videos</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../streets-of-rage-4-announces-new-platforms-and-introduces-rockin-new-hero-cherry-hunter-564200.phtml">character reveals</a> since its announcement have been incredibly promising, capturing the look, weight, and "feel" of the Sega Mega Drive classics, but adding that beautiful art and attention-to-detail that made <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-wonder-boy-the-dragon-s-trap-431516.phtml"><i>Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap</i></a> such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that we'll be seeing the return of Axel, Blaze and co. this side of 2020. It's getting a little late in the day for that. But at least the studio has dropped a new, eight-minute video giving us a look at how development is going on the new sequel, coming some 25 since the launch of <i>Streets of Rage 3.</i><br/><br/>In the video, we see the painstaking process taken to emulate the animation and style of the original games, while keeping the action bang-up-to-date for a modern audience. I particularly like the moment where<i> SoR</i> and <i>SoR 4</i> are being played split-screen, do the developers can see exactly how tight their animations sync up between the two titles.</p>

      <p>Crucially, developer Jordi Asensio notes that they don't want to "over-modernise" <i>Streets of Rage 4.</i> That is, Lizardcube aren't feeling the need to cram in a whole load of current trends specifically to give the game false depth, instead focusing on the core of what makes <i>Streets of Rage</i> great. I can attest that this approach worked in <i>The Dragon's Trap</i> and I've no doubt it will work here.<br/><br/>I couldn't be more excited for<i> Streets of Rage 4</i>. It's definitely my most anticipated video game right now. As a side-note, be sure to look for a Good Doge at 02:05 in the video.<br/><br/><i>Streets of Rage 4</i> is currently in development for PS4, PC, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.</p>
