        <i>Two men and a woman held in connection with kidnapping of businessman who was beaten</i>
      </p>
      <p>Irish police have arrested two men and a woman in connection with the abduction of the businessman Kevin Lunney.</p>
      <p>They were arrested on Thursday morning in relation to the kidnapping of the Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) director on 17 September.</p>
      <p>Lunney, 50, was abducted outside his home near Derrylin, County Fermanagh, and taken to a horsebox across the border, where he was badly beaten.</p>
      <p>His attackers broke his leg, sliced his fingernails and face with a knife, carved QIH on his chest and doused him in bleach.</p>
      <p>A man in his 20s and a man in his 40s were detained under section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, while the woman in her 50s was held under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.</p>
      <p>The attack, during which Lunney’s assailants demanded his resignation as director, was the most serious in a five-year campaign of intimidation targeting the companies and directors that now control the business portfolio built up by Seán Quinn, who was formerly Ireland’s richest man.</p>
      <p>An Garda Síochána said they were not providing any further information on the arrests at this time and urged anyone with information to contact them.</p>
      <p>A convicted criminal considered a key suspect in the attack on Lunney died last week during a police raid in England.</p>
      <p>The suspect, understood to be Cyril McGuinness, a known gangster and smuggler, was taken ill while Derbyshire police were searching a house in Buxton that he was staying in on Friday morning. It is believed he had a heart attack.</p>
