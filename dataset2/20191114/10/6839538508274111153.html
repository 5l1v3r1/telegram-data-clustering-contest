      <p>Sun Princess has again grappled with an outbreak of norovirus aboard one of their vessels that left Perth for Singapore earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The highly contagious virus, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea, reportedly spread across the Carnival Australia owned-ship causing crews to evacuate all passengers for fumigation in Singapore yesterday.</p>
      <p>The ship departed Fremantle on November 1, on what was supposed to be a 12-night voyage.</p>
      <p>While the ship has recommenced its journey, it’s understood some passengers have decided to fly back to Australia.</p>
      <p>Norovirus symptoms general start in the first or second day of contamination and usually lasts between one and three days.</p>
      <p>The virus can be spread through touching objects, survive on surfaces and is easily spread from person-to-person.</p>
      <p>In 2016 and 2017, the Carnival Australia experienced a string of outbreaks on eight consecutive voyages.</p>
      <p>The outbreaks lead to a large scale Class Action Investigation into Carnival Australia on behalf of the affected passengers.</p>
      <p>A Princess Cruises spokeswoman creating and maintaining a healthy onboard environment was “always a priority”.</p>
      <p>“Onboard sanitation was swiftly stepped up following some guests reporting gastrointestinal symptoms confirmed as being due to Norovirus,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The vast majority of the 2000 guests on Sun Princess were unaffected but it takes relatively few cases of illness to be reported for onboard sanitation measures to be increased.</p>
      <p>“Out of an abundance of care and in line with best practice, extra cleaning of the terminal was also carried out yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Guests remain isolated while they have symptoms.</p>
      <p>“There are also constant reminders for guests to wash their hands regularly to stay well and help maintain a healthy environment.”</p>
      <p>She wouldn’t comment when asked if passengers would be compensated or reveal how many people had been affected.</p>
