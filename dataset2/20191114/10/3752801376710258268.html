          <b>Hawks colonel shot dead at Cape Town home</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Acting Western Cape Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Sindile Mfazi conveyed his condolences to the officer's loved ones and described him as a dedicated police official.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trauma counselling</b>
      </p>
      <p>His colleagues and family were receiving trauma counselling, Potelwa said.</p>
      <p>One of the ward councillors in the Bishop Lavis precinct, Angus McKenzie, described the officer's murder as "senseless".</p>
      <p>"I strongly encourage that no stone is left unturned in bringing this disgusting and vile individual or individuals to book that have committed this attack against our community and country," he said.</p>
      <p>"No law enforcement official deserves to die in such a way!"</p>
      <p>The officer's name is known to News24, but will only published when his next of kin are informed of his death.</p>
      <p>According to Lieutenant General Christine Mgwenya, 29 police officers were killed in the line of duty during the 2017/2018 financial year.<br/><br/>However, that number is lower than the 56 killed while off duty over the same period.<br/><br/>Data going back to 2012/13 indicates that off-duty unnatural deaths far outnumber the deaths of police officers while on duty, according to a SAPS briefing to Parliament in 2015.</p>
