      <h1>Huawei Y9s Officially Launched in Kenya</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:04:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">George Kamau</a></address>
      <p>Early today, Huawei officially launched the Huawei Y9s and announced the Band 4 smartwatch series. Huawei recently <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/11/13/huawei-y9s-band-4e-to-be-launched-in-kenyan-market/">announced</a> they’ll be bringing these two devices, the Huawei Y9s and the Band 4 to the Kenyan market and now they’re finally here.</p>
      <p>The Huawei Y9s is the company’s first phone in Kenya to rock a side-mounted fingerprint sensor.</p>

      <p>Continuing its trend of ditching the notch for a full-screen experience, the Huawei Y9s comes with a pop-up selfie camera to give that almost bezel-less design. The 6.59″ LCD display is stunning and comes with a resolution of FHD+ at 2340×1080 and in a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p>
      <p>That large display of the Huawei Y9s will offer you enough screen real-estate to consume multimedia content or for mobile gaming.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The back looks elegant too with he colour-gradient back and the Huawei Y9s comes in two colours – Midnight Black and Breathing Crystal. The back is curved to give a good grip for easy one-handed use.</p>

      <p>For optics, the Huawei Y9s features 4 cameras: triple AI-powered rear cameras and a pop-up selfie camera. The main cameras include 48MP, an 8MP wide-angle camera and a 2MP depth sensor for bokeh shots.</p>
      <p>There’s a dedicated night mode with the Huawei Y9s  that won’t fail to impress you if you like going out and enjoying the nightlife. You’ll have to stay still though to capture shots in low light sceneries.</p>
      <p>The 48MP sensor on the Huawei Y9s uses Quad-Bayer technology to combine four pixels into one for better low light performance.</p>
      <p>For selfies, you get a 16MP camera that uses a pop-up mechanism that retracts the camera back into the phone’s body when the sensors notice a sharp and fast decline. Modes you can play around with include bokeh and beauty for those perfect selfies.</p>
      <p>For assurance, the retractable camera has been tested thoroughly and can sustain up to 100,000 pop-ups.</p>
      <p>Powering the Huawei Y9s is a 2.2Ghz octa-core Kirin 710F chip coupled with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. You can still expand the storage using an external micro-SD card. For gamers, the Huawei Y9s also rocks GPU Turbo 3.0.</p>
