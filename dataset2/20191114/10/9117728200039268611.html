      <p>"<i>The concept is interesting and should bring better racing, in which the cars catch up closer to the frontman and easier to overtake</i>," Horner told Speedweek.</p>
      <p>"<i>But the whole package is not mature yet, the cars will be completely different. There will still have to be many clarifications in detail</i>.</p>

      <p>Currently, the top three teams have a major advantage over the rest with fourth-placed McLaren 245 points behind Red Bull Racing who are in third.</p>
      <p>From next season, there will be 22 races on the schedule, but Horner feels increasing this by much more would cause problems.</p>

      <p>"<i>This is going to be very tough. Next year with 22 races, we try to make up for it with fewer tests. But at some point, oversaturation threatens. I think 21 is optimum</i>."</p>
