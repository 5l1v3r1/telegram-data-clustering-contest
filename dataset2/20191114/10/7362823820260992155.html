      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/detroit-pistons">Detroit Pistons</a> guard Khyri Thomas had surgery on his right foot and will be out at least six weeks.</p>
      <p>The Pistons said Wednesday that Thomas had the procedure on the fifth metatarsal of his right foot. They say rehabilitation will begin immediately and that Thomas will be re-evaluated for a status update in six weeks.</p>
      <p>Thomas had missed the Pistons’ last two games due to a stress reaction in his right foot.</p>
      <p>Thomas was the 38th overall pick in the 2018 draft. He played in just two games so far this season. He averaged 2.3 points in 26 games last season.</p>
