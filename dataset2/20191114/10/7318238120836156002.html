      <p>A steel site in southern Italy run by struggling firm Irva has been accused of causing thousands of deaths linked to toxic emissions.</p>
      <p>Residents complain that air pollution is killing many elderly people and children.</p>
      <p>The Tamburi site is at the centre of a huge legal case. Experts cited by prosecutors have said some 7,500 people were killed in the area over seven years by diseases linked to toxic emissions.</p>
      <p>Residents here live under a curfew especially during the so called “wind days”. This is when the wind is too strong and the risk of emissions coming from the plant is higher.</p>
      <p>Schools also close earlier on these days.</p>
      <p>The Tamburi area is situated just a few metres away from the factory. Here, cancer among children is 50 percent more common than in any other part of the region.</p>
      <p>Grazia Parisi, a Paediatrician, says older children have become aware of the fact they are in danger:</p>
      <blockquote>They feel their lives are in danger. They keep hearing their parents talking about the mineral dust found in schools, inside their homes. They ask me will I live less than the children who don’t live in Taranto? I know families that have been devastated. Children here see their aunts and uncles dying and their grandparents also dying at a young age …their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters.</blockquote>
      <h3>Is anything being done to solve the crisis?</h3>
      <p>Last January, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Italy for failing to protect its citizens.</p>
      <p>It’s under renewed scrutiny following the failed takeover bid by steel giant ArcelorMittal.</p>
      <p>ArcelorMittal pulling out of the purchase of Italy's struggling steel firm leaves the issue of environmental pollution hanging.</p>
      <p>The group was given a period of legal immunity to bring the plant up to environmental standards.</p>
