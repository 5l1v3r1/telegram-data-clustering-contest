      <p>TORONTO - The case of three boys who pleaded guilty in a sexual assault scandal at an all-boys Catholic school is due back in court today.</p>
      <p>The former students at St. Michael's College School in Toronto each pleaded guilty last month to one count of sexual assault with a weapon and one count of assault with a weapon.</p>
      <p>One of them also pleaded guilty to making child pornography.</p>
      <p>The charges stem from two separate incidents that happened in October and November of last year.</p>
      <p>The sexual assault and assault charges against a fourth student were withdrawn in August.</p>
      <p>The cases of two other students accused in the scandal have concluded, but the Ministry of the Attorney General has refused to disclose those outcomes. A seventh teen is set to go to trial next March.</p>
