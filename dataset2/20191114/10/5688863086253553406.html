        <b>Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) president Jagnnath Singh has written to the BCCI president Sourav Ganguly informing him of supposed illegal activities taking place in Bihar cricket. Jagnnath has alleged that the activities are going on under the protection of BCCI GM Cricket Operations Saba Karim.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the email, as accessed by IANS, Jagnnath has claimed that Karim is protecting the interests of the defunct committee led by Rabi Shankar Prasad Singh. He further pointed out the various email he had sent to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) to highlight the illegal running of the BCA. </p>
      <p>Earlier, Jagnnath filed a contempt plea against the CoA, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> CEO Rahul Johri and Karim for violating orders passed by the apex court on August 9, 2018. Jagnnath initially wrote to the CoA, warning them of the petition after the BCCI uploaded an unregistered constitution of the BCA sent by Gopal Bohra and Rabi Shankar over the one sent by his committee. Prior to this, he had also written to the CoA regarding the continued function of the disqualified committee led by Bohra and Co. Secretary Aditya Verma, meanwhile, had requested for the formation of an ad-hoc committee to run the state’s cricket until the mess was cleared. </p>
      <p>As per the email to Ganguly, the BCA President has requested for a fresh inquiry, hoping it will lead to necessary actions in the case so that the cricketers of Bihar may not be allowed to be frustrated on account of the selection of players from outside the state on the basis of monetary superiority.</p>
