      <p>The Queen's former press secretary has slammed TV show The Crown for suggesting she had an affair with her horse racing manager Lord Porchester.</p>
      <p>Series three – which enjoyed its premiere last night in London – drops on Netflix this weekend.</p>
      <p>Ahead of its release, Dickie Arbiter told <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-crown-is-slammed-over-queens-affair-p6w0ds9rw">The Sunday Times</a>: "The Queen is the last person in the world to have ever considered looking at another man."</p>

      <p>Episode five of the new series of The Crown will see the monarch – played by Olivia Colman – travel to stud farms in America and France with "Porchie".</p>
      <p>Upon her return, she is seen being questioned by husband Prince Philip.</p>

      <p>While Her Majesty was friends with Lord Porchester until his death in 2001, there is no evidence to suggest they shared anything more than friendship.</p>

      <p>Dickie accused The Crown’s writer Peter Morgan of "beefing up" his scripts and said he was worried people will take whatever he writes as "sacrosanct".</p>

      <p>"The Crown is fiction – people will tell the story they want to and sensationalise it," he said.</p>
      <p>Fans of the monarch aren't best pleased about the show's scandalous storyline.</p>
      <p>One said: "Yeah – this was really not cool of @netflix."</p>
