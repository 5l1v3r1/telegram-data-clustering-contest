      <h1>PayPal Pulls Out of Pornhub, Hurting 'Hundreds of Thousands' of Performers</h1>

      <p>Pornhub announced late Wednesday that PayPal is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3abgv/paypal-pulls-out-of-pornhub-payments">no longer supporting payments for Pornhub</a> -- a decision that will impact thousands of performers using the site as a source of income. From a report:<i> Most visitors to Pornhub likely think of it as a website that simply provides access to an endless supply of free porn, but Pornhub also allows performers to upload, sell, and otherwise monetize videos they make themselves. Performers who used PayPal to get paid for this work now have to switch to a different payment method. "We are all devastated by PayPal's decision to stop payouts to over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods," the company said on its blog. It then directed models to set up a new payment method, with instructions on how PayPal users can transfer pending payments. "We sincerely apologize if this causes any delays and we will have staff working around the clock to make sure all payouts are processed as fast as possible on the new payment methods," the statement said.</i></p>
