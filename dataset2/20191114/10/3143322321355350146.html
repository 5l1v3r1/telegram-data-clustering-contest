        <b>In the unfortunate event that you are caught in a hailstorm, here are some tips to consider:</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Keep calm: Lower your speed and ensure your lights or hazards are turned on for increased visibility.</p>
      <p>2. Find a safe place to pull over: Ideally it is preferable to try and pull over and wait out the storm where there is cover. You must, however, always remain in your car to avoid personal injury.</p>
