      <p>Are ya ready, kids?! SpongeBob and Patrick are back in the new trailer for the latest <i>SpongeBob</i> movie, <i>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge On The Run</i>.</p>
      <p>The first-ever all-CGI <i>SpongeBob</i> motion picture is slated for a May 2020 release, and features the voices of Tom Kenny, Awkwafina, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Carolyn Lawrence, Douglas Lawrence and Reggie Watts. <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Keanu+Reeves">Keanu Reeves</a> makes a little cameo, and we would argue it’s going to be the pinnacle of his career.</p>
      <p>The film’s synopsis reads:</p>
      <p>After SpongeBob’s beloved pet snail Gary is snail-napped, he and Patrick embark on an epic adventure to The Lost City of Atlantic City to bring Gary home. As they navigate the delights and dangers on this perilous and hilarious rescue mission, SpongeBob and his pals prove there’s nothing stronger than the power of friendship.</p>
      <p>Watch the trailer—which also features a young SpongeBob at Camp Coral and the story of how he met Gary—below.</p>
