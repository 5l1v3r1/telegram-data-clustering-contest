        <b>The song is said to have been recorded a decade ago</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/eminem">Eminem</a> has reportedly responded to a song leak in which he appeared to “side with Chris Brown” over assaulting <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/rihanna">Rihanna</a>.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week (November 11), a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eminem/comments/dr783s/snippet_eminem_things_get_worse_rihanna_diss/"><i>Reddit</i></a> user uploaded a seven-second clip titled ‘(SNIPPET) Eminem – Things Get Worse (Rihanna Diss)’ last week, which is said to have been recorded during sessions for Marshall Mathers’ 2009 album, ‘Relapse’.</p>
      <p>“<i>Of course I side with Chris Brown, I’d beat a bitch down too</i>,” spits Eminem in the track which went on to become B.o.B’s ‘Things Get Worse’ in 2011.</p>
      <p>Despite the line being removed for the final version, the rapper does say he “murdered” Dakota Fanning – who was then 16 years old – and “put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer” in the release.</p>
      <p>Now, former Interscope executive Dennis Dennehy, released a statement addressing the track to <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/eminem-rihanna-chris-brown-assault-lyrics-song-leaks/"><i>XXL</i></a>. He said: “After Eminem recorded it, he scrapped it and rewrote it. He and Rihanna have a great relationship.”</p>

      <p>The leaked line appears to have been tracked shortly after Chris Brown physically attacked Rihanna in 2009. The then-couple <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/rihanna-315-1311269">were involved in an altercation while on their way to the Grammys that year</a>. Brown was later found guilty of felony assault.</p>
      <p>Eminem and Rihanna have collaborated on a number of occasions following the recording of the song – joining forces on the singles ‘Love The Way You Lie’, ‘Numb’ and ‘The Monster’.</p>
      <p><i>NME</i> has contacted representatives of Eminem for comment.</p>
      <p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/chris-brown-criticised-blaming-rihanna-2125751">Chris Brown was accused of “blaming” Rihanna for his assault on the pop star</a>. He was criticised by various domestic abuse charities over <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/spitting-blood-chris-brown-looks-back-rihanna-pre-grammys-attack-2125201">comments he made detailing an argument the couple had </a>after a woman he previously slept with attended the same pre-Grammys party.</p>
