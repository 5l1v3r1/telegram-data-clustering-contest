      <p>Motorola, a smartphone brand now owned by Chinese electronics manufacturer Lenovo, has unveiled the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-motorola">Motorola </a>Razr (2019) – a bendable-screen smartphone based on the company’s iconic flip-phone, the Moto Razr (original). The reprise of the Moto Razr makes <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-motorola">Motorola </a>the third company among popular mobile phone makers, to bring a foldable smartphone with bendable screen. The other two are Samsung and Huawei. However, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-motorola">Motorola </a>Razr is the only device that makes no big claim of being a smartphone and a tablet. Instead, it works like a smartphone irrespective of how you use it – folded or unfolded – and that is what makes it different from its counterparts.</p>

        <b>Motorola Razr India launch</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Motorola Razr was unveiled on Wednesday in a global event held in Los Angeles. Soon after the unveiling, the company’s India subsidiary posted the phone’s silhouette as a cover image on its official Twitter account. On Thursday, the company also updated its official web portal with Motorola Razr branding and a “coming soon” message, confirming that the phone will be launched in India. Though not confirmed, one can expect the India launch by early next year as the phone goes on sale in the US starting from January 9, 2020.

        <b>Motorola Razr features</b>
      </p>
      <p>Continuing with the legacy of the Moto Razr, the Motorola Razr boasts a clamshell design with two screens. In the folded form, the phone’s smaller touchscreen on the front allows you to interact with app notifications, music controls, camera functions, and more. Unfold the phone and its primary bendable touchscreen comes into play. The device does not claimed to be anything more than a smartphone, in either folded or unfolded state.</p>

      <p>According to Motorola, the Razr is a pocket-ready size of a flip-phone that fits comfortably on your palm in both folded and unfolded states. For longevity, the phone’s hinge is engineered in a way that it leaves no gap between the phone’s bendable display while also keeping it safe. Like the Samsung Galaxy Fold, the Motorola Razr’s dual displays are made to work together. According to the company, information you interact with on the small screen using phone’s “Quick View” feature moves to the bendable screen the moment you flip open the device.</p>
