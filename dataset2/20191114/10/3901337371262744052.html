      <p>Following Cristiano Ronaldo's recent tantrums and Maurizio Sarri's claims the Portuguese forward is struggling with an injury, one of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's Portugal teammates has claimed the Juventus striker appears fully fit in national team training.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has been substituted in two consecutive matches for the Bianconeri, with Sarri claiming, on both occasions, that he has been carrying a knock.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo's reactions to being taken off has suggested otherwise, however, especially this past weekend, when he was replaced in the 55th minute against AC Milan.</p>
      <p>The former Real Madrid man kicked up a fuss after Sarri's decision to withdraw him from the match, heading straight down the tunnel and leaving the stadium early, as per reports in Italy.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, a publication in Portugal claimed that Ronaldo had trained normally with his international colleagues, showing no signs of an injury.</p>
      <p>Eintracht Frankfurt forward Goncalo Paciencia, 25, has since seemingly confirmed the report, insisting his teammate looks to be completely fine in national team training this week.</p>
      <p>"I don't have a medical degree, but he's looked fine to me," he told Portuguese newspaper <i>A Bola</i>.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is that he's here because he's the best in the world."</p>
