      <p>A former headteacher who tried to ban a string of books over LGBT+ themes has been indicted on charges of possessing child sex abuse imagery.</p>
      <p>Phillip Todd Wilson faces 17 charges that were approved by a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kentucky">Kentucky</a> grand jury on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They relate to images portraying sexual activity by a child under 16, according to <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Former-Ky-principal-indicted-on-child-porn-charges--564831181.html">WKYT</a>, a CBS affiliate station.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster also reported that Mr Wilson had been the principal of the Clark County area technology centre, which was located on a high school campus.</p>
      <p>Previously, the 54-year-old was the headteacher of Montgomery County high school, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/principal-who-banned-gay-books-charged-child-pornography-n1081461?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma">NBC News</a> reported.</p>
      <p>While there he led an effort to ban a number of books containing LGBT-related themes and references to drugs, sex, suicide and child abuse, which he and others deemed inappropriate.</p>
      <p>Four books were successfully pulled from school shelves, reports said.</p>
      <p>In August, when Mr Wilson was arrested, one of the authors wrote on Facebook: “I am having a lot of feelings right now. As I said to some friends last night when I got the news, ‘You can’t make this s**t up’.”</p>
      <p>During an earlier court appearance, Mr Wilson denied the charges against him, WKYT reported.</p>
