      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> were left in hysterics as Roy Cropper's 'secret identity' was revealed on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Viewers know Carla, along with Roy's other friends, has recently been <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-roy-to-become-an-online-scrabble-addict/">concerned about his online gaming.</a></p>
      <p>However, it turns out his reason for playing online Scrabble was because he believed his partner was his long-lost half-brother, Richard.</p>

      <p>In last night's episodes of the soap (November 13 2019) Roy finally got to meet Richard.</p>
      <aside>I'm Batman oh my days I can't breathe for laughing.</aside>
      <p>But rather than giving Richard his real name, Roy introduced himself as "Batman" - his online alter ego and screen name.</p>
      <p>Carla, who went along with Roy, introduced herself as "Batman's friend".</p>
      <p>Fans were left in hysterics at Roy's screen name.</p>

      <p>During his visit to Richard, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-roy-finds-his-long-lost-brother/">Roy eventually confessed that he was really his half-brother.</a></p>
      <p>He explained their mother Sylvia had an affair with Richard's father Raymond.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But when Roy read the love letters between his mother and Raymond, he found out Sylvia went away for a long period of time.</p>
      <p>Roy realised his mother was pregnant and went away to give her baby up for adoption.</p>
      <p>Although Richard was happy to meet Roy and finally find out about his birth family, his <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-roy-cropper-to-move-in-with-teen-goth/">daughter Nina wasn't as welcoming.</a></p>
      <p>Could this be the start of a new friendship for Roy?</p>
