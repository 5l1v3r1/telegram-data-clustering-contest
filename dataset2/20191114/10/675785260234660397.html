      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:32:02+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>In a historic moment for the aviation industry, a new direct flight from the UK to Australia has taken off today.</p>
      <p>Qantas re-purposed a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft for the route, which took off from London Heathrow and is heading for Sydney. (It took off with a 47-minute delay).</p>
      <p>The flight is expected to take around 19.5 hours in order to cover the 17,800 km distance, with around 50 passengers and members of crew on board.</p>
      <p>It marks the second time in history that a commercial airline has flown direct from London to the Australian city.</p>
      <p>The first time was also a Qantas route in 1989, when the airline operated a 747-400 ferry flight between the two cities.</p>

      <p>In fact, this still holds the record for the world's longest commercial flight, having been in the air for 20 hours and 9 minutes. (Aviation enthusiasts can see the very plane at the aviation museum south of Sydney).</p>
      <p>The London Heathrow-Sydney route is part of a series of tests 'Project Sunrise', the airline's venture to operate regular, direct commercial flights from Australia's eastern coast to London and New York.</p>

      <p>As part of the venture, earlier this year Qantas hosted the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/worlds-longest-dreamliner-flight-touches-20666306">world's longest Dreamliner flight</a> , which broke records after touching down after nearly 20 hours in the air between New York and Sydney.</p>
      <p>While the Heathrow-Sydney flight is over 1,500 kilometers further than New York to Sydney, the duration is expected to be similar due to prevailing tail winds between the two cities.</p>
      <p>The airline will also be testing another flight between New York and Sydney in December.</p>
      <p>There's no denying that there could be big changes coming for passengers who want to fly from the UK to Australia.</p>
      <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/australia-new-zealand/uk-flights-australia-could-take-20174710">UK flights to Australia could take just four hours</a> thanks to a new engine currently being researched, that could travel up to five times the speed of sound.</p>
