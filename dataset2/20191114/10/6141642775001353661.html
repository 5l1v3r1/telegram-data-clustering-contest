      <p>“I have a great relationship with the members and fans and I can’t thank them enough for the support they give the team and me as an individual. I’d also like to thank (head coach) Jason Kerr and (director of cricket) Andy Hurry for the belief they have shown in me. I’m looking forward to the winter and can’t wait for next season.”</p>
