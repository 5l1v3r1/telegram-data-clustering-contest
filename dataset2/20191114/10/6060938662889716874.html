      <h1>Lata Mangeshkar's health update: The singer is stable and the family looks forward to take her home soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:31:03+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Ace <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lata-Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital earlier this week, is showing positive <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/health">health</a> signs and the family is looking forward to taking her home as soon as she recovers.</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar, 90, was admitted to the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Breach-Candy-Hospital">Breach Candy Hospital</a> after complaining about difficulty in breathing. Reportedly, is now showing some signs of improvement but it will take time for her to recover. She has <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and chest infection. Any person suffering from it takes time to recover from it.</p>
      <p>We came across a statement sent by Lata's spokesperson. The statement is as follows: "Lata Mangeshkar ji Progress Statement:</p>
      <p>Lata didi is stable. The progress is steady and good. We look forward to take her home as she gets well. Thank You for your prayers and support."</p>
      <p>In her over seven-decade career, Mangeshkar has sung over 30,000 songs across languages. She is considered one of the greatest playback singers in Indian cinema. She received the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bharat-Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>, India's highest civilian honour, in 2001.</p>
