      <h1>[Good Deal] Microsoft Surface Go 64GB for $399 at JB Hi-Fi</h1>

      <p>In October last year we had the opportunity to <a href="https://ausdroid.net/2018/10/26/microsoft-surface-go-ausdroid-review/">review the Microsoft Surface Go</a>. It was so good that Scott purchased one after the review. While the high-end models are pretty costly, the entry level unit is reasonably cheap. At the moment through <a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/microsoft-surface-go-64gb-tablet?utm_campaign=jb-au-20191112-surface%20%28JUXdhq%29&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Newsletter%20Active%20%28Opened%2060%20Days%29&amp;_ke=eyJrbF9lbWFpbCI6ICJwaGlsLnRhbm5AZ21haWwuY29tIiwgImtsX2NvbXBhbnlfaWQiOiAiTFF6bnRSIn0%3D">JB Hi-Fi</a>, it’s a <i>very</i> cheap at $399.</p>
      <p>The attraction of the Surface Go stems from its portability, capability and of course cost. Being a Windows based machine it’s got all of the capability you’d expect (albeit limited by the hardware) from a Windows machine, and unlike some more expensive Surface products, it has a very handy USB-C port.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that the base purchase <b>only</b> includes the tablet; if you’re after the type case (clip on keyboard) then it will cost an extra $149.95 on top of the tablet. The Surface Pen, too, is an additional cost but it really isn’t necessary unless you’re planning on drawing (and the Surface Go is a bit small for that).</p>
      <p>For the vast majority of users though, this will be not just a tablet but a laptop/desktop replacement as well. At $548.95 that’s still a pretty good investment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/microsoft-surface-go-64gb-tablet?utm_campaign=jb-au-20191112-surface%20%28JUXdhq%29&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Newsletter%20Active%20%28Opened%2060%20Days%29&amp;_ke=eyJrbF9lbWFpbCI6ICJwaGlsLnRhbm5AZ21haWwuY29tIiwgImtsX2NvbXBhbnlfaWQiOiAiTFF6bnRSIn0%3D">The JB Hi-Fi product listing</a> shows this as limited stock, probably to make way for a new model. If you’re keen on a bargain, having a generation old piece of hardware shouldn’t bother you. With the Surface Go it will still perform admirably, particularly for the dollars you’ve invested.</p>
