      <p>We love a Disney fashion collaboration as much as the next person, however, one thing they almost all seem to have in common is that that fail to acknowledge some of the Disney fam‚Äôs most iconic characters: the villains.</p>
      <p>Whether you love them or still love to hate them, there‚Äôs no denying the likes of Cruella de Vil, Ursula, and Maleficent are responsible for some of the most fabulously savage quotes of our childhood. I, for one, am still not over the time Maleficent called her subjects ‚Äúpoor, simple fools‚Äù and dubbed herself The Mistress of Evil. I mean, power move or <i>what</i>?</p>
      <p>So what better way to celebrate these characters than with some snazzy-themed accessories? <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525071&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skinnydiplondon.com%2Fcollections%2Fdisney-x-skinnydip&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fuk%2Ffashion%2Fstyle%2Fg29781977%2Fskinnydip-london-disney-villain-range%2F%3Fsrc%3DsocialflowFB%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DsocialflowFB%26slide%3D1">Skinnydip London</a> just launched a capsule range of neat phone cases and makeup bags, available online and in stores today, inspired by three of the sassiest baddies of all time.</p>
      <p>Whether you‚Äôre on the hunt for the perfect Christmas present or you just want to treat yourself, these affordably priced goodies are set to be utterly enchanting additions to your cart.</p>
      <p>Scroll through to see the collection...</p>
