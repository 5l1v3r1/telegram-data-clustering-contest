      <blockquote><b>The Reaganomics</b> have been kicking around the Red Scare roster for about 10 years and they only show their faces when they feel there’s a need to mock Republicans and/or ladder-climbing scenester punks. And let’s be honest: there’s currently a need. These dudes are from Joliet, Illinois (hold your applause), and they don’t ever tour because they have weird jobs like… music teacher and stuff. Their rare live shows are half laughs and half a display of exorbitant musicianship. But we got them to head into Chicago to record with Dan Tinkler (The Falcon, Elway, etc.) and crank out 13 songs of hefty shreddin’. This new Nomix record is called “The Aging Punk”, and it sounds like if you took the comedic writing of The Hard Times and merged it with Propagandhi’s heavy thrash-punk. You probably will never see this foursome on tour, so the only chance you have to enjoy these wicked riffs is right here on this new album!</blockquote>
      <p>Midwest punks The Reaganomics are releasing their new album <i>The Aging Punk</i> on December 13 via Red Scare Industries (<a href="https://thereaganomics.bandcamp.com/album/the-aging-punk">pre-order</a>), and that’s the album description above from Red Scare’s website, which was too good to not include. We’re premiering the new song and video “Grown Ass Man,” which continues in the tongue-in-cheek “we’re too old for this shit” vein of the above quote (and the album title), and here’s what the band tells us about it: “Hold onto your White Claws, Millennials, our new album is Ramones meets Dio meets middle age. We’re back and ready to rage, just have to be done by 9pm.”</p>
      <p>About the video, the band also adds, “This video is based on true, unfortunate events, such as growing old and falling down. We don’t make music videos, this is why.” The whole thing is very fun and funny in that jokey skate punk kind of way that never really goes out of style. Check it out for yourself below.</p>
      <p>Also below is the tracklist, including a song called “Confessions Of A Snowflake Lib-Tard.”</p>
