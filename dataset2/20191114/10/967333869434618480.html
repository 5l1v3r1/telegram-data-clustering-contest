      <p>At a ceremony in Brasilia on Wednesday, which Sputnik is exclusively covering, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911141077301635-brics-leaders-meet-in-brazil-for-two-day-11th-summit---video/">the deal was signed by the bank's President, Kundapur Vaman Kamath, and Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Storchak.</a></p>
      <p>In a comment to Sputnik, the NDB president said that the office was expected to open in the next two or three months.</p>
      <blockquote>"We have seen that whenever we open an office in a particular country, it adds a big [investment] pipeline. I am sure that we will have a very good pipeline in Russia after we are able to open our office in the next two or three months", Kamath stated after the ceremony.</blockquote>
      <p>Storchak told Sputnik that about five to seven people would be working at the NDB's Eurasian Regional Center in Moscow.</p>
      <p>Under the deal, apart from the Moscow office, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911141077302121-russias-putin-says-2020-brics-summit-in-st-petersburg-will-focus-on-economy/">NDB may also set up offices in other Russian cities,</a> depending on its functions and business needs.</p>
