        <b>World Rugby have confirmed that Scotland will seek no further action against them and have expressed their regret over comments made by chief executive Mark Dodson during the World Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scotland were officially reprimanded for their conduct earlier this month and were ordered by a disciplinary committee to “issue in writing a meaningful apology to World Rugby”.</p>
      <p>World Rugby have this morning <a href="https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/news/540631">issued a statement</a> confirming that Scotland have accepted their punishment despite rumours that the SRU would challenge the fine further.</p>

      <blockquote>“World Rugby can confirm that the Scottish Rugby Union has expressed its regret and has confirmed it will not challenge World Rugby further on this matter.</blockquote>
      <p>“The Scottish Rugby Union has agreed to pay a donation of £70,000 to World Rugby and the matter is now closed. There will be no further comment from either party.”</p>
      <p>The issue first arose when Scotland’s pivotal Pool A clash with Japan was under threat due to the effects of the deadly Typhoon Hagibis.</p>
      <p>Dodson strongly criticised World Rugby for their lack of a contingency plan and threatened legal action if the fixture, which they eventually lost, did not go ahead.</p>
      <p>The governing body then <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/kennedymarisa760/world-rugby-misconduct-scottish/">issued misconduct charges against the Scottish Rugby Union</a>.</p>
