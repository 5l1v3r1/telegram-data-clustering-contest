      <p><b>AOMORI — </b>A 14-year-old boy arrested for allegedly slashing an elementary school girl with a box cutter knife on a street earlier this week in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, has told police he intended to kill someone, investigative sources said Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to kill someone, anyone," one of the sources quoted the boy as saying. They said several box cutter knives were found in a bag he was believed to have been carrying at the time of the incident.</p>
      <p>The boy approached the sixth-grade girl from behind and slashed her throat as she was walking home alone from school at around 4:40 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, over 10 local policemen used a blue tarpaulin sheet to shield the suspect as they escorted him to a gray vehicle to send him to prosecutors.</p>
      <p>Japanese police do not release the names of arrested minors.</p>
      <p>The girl, left with a 10-centimeter-long gash as deep as 1 cm, was taken to a nearby hospital and is able to speak, according to the police.</p>
      <p>He may have attacked the girl when he was on his way home from his junior high school, the sources said. Investigators found the boy at a cram school in Hachinohe a few minutes after 8 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They are working to track the boy's moves before and after the incident, and to find motives for his alleged attack.</p>
