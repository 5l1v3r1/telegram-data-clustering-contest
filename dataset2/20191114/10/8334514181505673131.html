      <p>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch authorities on Thursday arrested a suspect in the killing of former professional soccer player Kelvin Maynard, news agency ANP reported.</p>
      <p>Defender Maynard, 32, died when two assailants on a motor-bike opened fire on his car in September in a southeastern district of Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>No details about the suspect were released.</p>
      <p>Maynard, who had been playing this season for Dutch amateur club “Alphense Boys”, had run-ins with the police in the past, authorities said at the time without providing details.</p>
      <p>He previously had been with Dutch side Volendam, Portugal’s Sporting Clube Olhanense, Hungary’s Kecskemeti TE, Belgium’s Antwerp FC and England’s Burton Albion.</p>
      <p>While shooting deaths are rare, alarm has been growing over crime in Amsterdam, a city of 800,000 people where recreational drug use has long been tolerated by law enforcement, creating an underworld of dealers and suppliers that sometimes fuels violence.</p>
