      <h1>China presses Washington for tariff cut in trade deal</h1>

      <p>BEIJING -- China pressed Washington on Thursday to roll back punitive tariffs in a tentative trade deal.</p>
      <p>A tariff cut is an "important condition" for the agreement that is part of talks on ending a costly trade war, said Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng.</p>
      <p>Beijing said last week American negotiators agreed to roll back penalties imposed in September on $112 billion of Chinese imports if an agreement goes ahead. President Donald Trump dismissed that a day later, jolting global financial markets.</p>
      <p>Trump postponed a planned tariff hike on $250 billion of Chinese goods after announcing the "Phase 1" agreement Oct. 12. Negotiators have been working on the details of the agreement since then.</p>
      <p>"The trade war started with the imposition of tariffs, and it should also end with the abolition of tariffs," Gao said at a regular news briefing. "This is an important condition for the two sides to reach an agreement."</p>
      <p>Negotiators are "discussing this in depth," Gao said.</p>
      <p>Details of the Oct. 12 agreement have not yet been released. But it doesn't address basic disputes about trade, Chinese industrial subsidies and technology policy.</p>
      <p>Economists say a final settlement is unlikely this year. Some have expressed skepticism the two sides can complete the "Phase 1" deal.</p>
      <p>Also Thursday, Asian stock markets fell after The Wall Street Journal reported Chinese negotiators were reluctant to commit to a financial figure for purchases of American farm goods.</p>
      <p>Trump said Beijing would buy up to $50 billion worth, but Chinese officials never have confirmed that.</p>
