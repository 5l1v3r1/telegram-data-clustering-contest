      <p>One of Bollywood’s most loved couples – if not the most – are celebrating their first wedding anniversary today and if that doesn’t put a smile on your face, we don’t know what will.</p>
      <p>The couple decided to celebrate their big day by flying to Andhra Pradesh to offer prayers at a shrine at Tirumala. “Thankyou for all your love, prayers and good wishes,” Deepika captioned the post of them smiling at each other with love.</p>

      <p>Who could forget Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s wedding of year and those beautiful, heartfelt moments between the A-listers. The duo tied the knot at the Villa del Balbianello, on the shore of Lake Como in Italy. Arriving by boat, the actors and their guests made their way to a terrace at the front of the villa overlooking the lake, where the lavish ceremony appeared to have been held.</p>
      <p>DeepVeer dated for seven long years before finally walking down the aisle together and yet maintained a dignified silence on the countless relationship and breakup rumours. Now that Deepika and Ranveer have completed one year of blissful marriage, they couldn’t seem more in love.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look at some of the cutest moments of their marriage so far.</p>
