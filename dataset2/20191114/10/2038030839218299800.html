      <h1>Here's why Harry and Meghan won't be spending Christmas with the queen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:46:42+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – It turns out Harry and Meghan won't be returning home to spend Christmas with the queen this year – but before you get your knickers in a twist, there's a perfectly good reason for it.</p>
      <p>We previously reported that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be leaving for the US with Archie to spend Thanksgiving with Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, before returning to the UK for Christmas with the queen. But Buckingham Palace released an official statement on Wednesday, reports <a href="https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-are-skipping-christmas-with-the-royal-family-this-year/"><b>People</b></a>, confirming they won't have Christmas in the UK.</p>
      <p>"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month. Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess' mother, Doria Ragland."</p>
      <p>But the statement confirmed, "This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen."</p>
      <p>Though it's customary for the royals to spend Christmas together at Sandringham Estate – the queen's country house – we're sure there are no bad vibes here, and it comes as no surprise that Her Majesty approved the move.</p>
      <p>In fact, according to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/de/news/373740/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-to-spend-christmas-with-duchess-of-cambridge-s-parents"><b>E! News</b></a>, this isn't an entirely new break from royal tradition. In 2012, Kate and William spent the holidays with the Middletons in Bucklebury. Kate was pregnant with Prince George at the time.</p>
      <p>With this being Archie's first Christmas and Meghan and Harry spending most of the year in England, it makes sense that they'd want to spend some time with the duchess' side of the family. And after the past few months, it makes sense.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10333855/harry-meghan-decline-queen-sandringham-invitation/"><b>The Sun</b></a>, the couple's six-week break will start after Harry attends an event on Sunday. A source told the publication they "needed to recharge their batteries".</p>
      <p>"They need some time away to recharge and decide their plans for next year."</p>
