      <p>It used to be that Black Friday deals were only available on Friday, but now it's turned into a month-long event that seems to get bigger and bigger each year. While some of the best deals may only be available on Black Friday, and door buster offerings may start as early as the evening of Thanksgiving Day, that doesn't mean that you can't already score some pretty wild deals right this very minute.</p>

      <p>Retailers are trying to maximize exposure during this time of the year, which means that select items are going on sale ahead of the big day. You may be wondering if the prices will drop lower on Black Friday, or if it's worth shopping early, so let's answer some of your questions, and show you some of the best deals. We are currently just 16 days away from Black Friday, so it's time to get serious here.</p>

      <p>That's right, some of the advertised Black Friday pricing is available starting right now. You can save pretty big chunks of change on a variety of products. Let's take a look at some of the best deals that you can buy today so you skip the lines later this month.</p>
      <h4>DOSS Bluetooth Speakers</h4>
      <p>This is a one-day sale at Amazon that saves you big on a few different Bluetooth speaker models. There are five options available with prices starting at just $20. All of them have great reviews, with the top-rated model having over 15,000 reviews with nearly a 5-star rating.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>From super-affordable portable speakers to options with Alexa built-in, this sale lets you crank the volume for a little less. This one-day sale saves you up to 38%.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>Mint Mobile</h4>
      <p>Mint Mobile has already kicked off its Black Friday promotion, and it's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/carrier-deals-black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">one of the best carrier deals</a> we will see this month. The carrier is offering 12GB of data for just $15 a month, but you need to prepay for 3 months. That means you pay $45 to get three months of service, after which it renews at regular pricing.</p>

      <h4>Samsung Galaxy Tab A 7</h4>
      <p>When it comes to Android tablets we generally recommend avoiding them on Black Friday, but this offer we don't feel the need to do so for. It's an affordably priced tablet from Samsung that offers decent specs (albeit it being old) and won't turn into an unusable slab of glass in just a few weeks. It has a microSD card for adding more storage to it so you can easily transport all your favorite movies, media, and more with you everywhere.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Apple AirPods Pro</h4>
      <p>Black Friday is sure to bring <a href="https://www.imore.com/best-airpods-deals-black-friday">lots of deals to the AirPods lineup</a>, but one of the best is here right now. The recently-released AirPods Pro are already discounted at Amazon, which is a bit rare. We don't see many discounts on new Apple products, but that's not stopping these from being on sale. There is a shipping delay to make note of, though it's likely that Amazon will have stock available earlier than what's advertised.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>These are the newest addition to the AirPods lineup, and you can already save $14 on the purchase. There is a shipping delay, but the savings may be worth it.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Amazon Echo Show 8</h4>
      <p>Though only released a little over a month ago, Amazon's all-new Echo Show 8 instantly became the best Echo Show of the bunch. Sitting between the Echo Show 5 and the original Echo Show in both size and price, today the decision of which to pick is even easier than usual thanks to a $30 discount on the Echo Show 8 bringing its cost down to just $99.99. This is the first discount to reach this new device, and there's no telling how long it might stick around. It normally sells for $130.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>The all-new Echo Show 8 is equipped with an 8-inch HD display and Amazon Alexa's voice assistant which will keep you up to date on the latest news and weather announcements. You can even control other smart home devices, watch TV, and more.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Amazon Music Unlimited</h4>
      <p>Ahead of the big Black Friday push, Amazon has discounted its own Music Unlimited streaming service. You can get four months of access, which includes millions of songs that you can access anywhere using an app on your phone or tablet, for just $1. This saves you about $39 compared to the regular price, and makes it a no-brainer choice. It's 25 cents a month, how can you pass that up?</p>

The book goes for $5 by itself in most places, while the Google Home Mini is usually sold for up to $49. You can choose between Chalk and Aqua-colored models of the speaker while supplies last.</p>

      <h4>IPVanish VPN Subscription</h4>
      <p>Things are not what they used to be, and unfortunately not everyone can be trusted. Whether you're browsing from home or at a cafe, doing it on an unsecured connection can be dangerous. VPNs have become more popular in the recent years, and there's a good reason for it. IPVanish is one of our favorite services, and thanks to its Black Friday pricing you can get protected for as little as $3.25 a month when you redeem coupon code <b>CYBERDEAL19</b>.</p>

      <h3>Should you shop pre-Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>The answer here is not cut and dry, but in most cases we would say yes. You should absolutely already be shopping sales, and picking up things as you see them on sale. Many retailers have already dropped the Black Friday sale ads, so you can easily compare the pricing listed there to what it's available for right now. If the prices match, click buy now. There is no benefit to waiting for Black Friday and risking the item selling out or forgetting to purchase it, and being stuck then paying full price.</p>
      <h3>Will Black Friday bring lower prices?</h3>
      <p>You may or may not find lower pricing than you see right now on Black Friday itself. Retailers don't show off every single item that will be available at a discount and list the price ahead of the event, unfortunately, which means you have to take a risk. You'll need to weigh your options when shopping for some stuff, but keep in mind that making the purchase now is likely less stressful, and you won't have to worry about it selling out before you complete the transaction or missing out on the price you see.</p>
      <h3>Where should you look for Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>When it comes to Black Friday, just about everyone under the sun will be offering discounts. If you want to keep your searches under control, we'd recommend keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">Amazon's Black Friday</a> offerings, along with <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-buy-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">deals at Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals">don't forget to check out Walmart</a> during your pricing comparisons. These retailers offer a wide variety of product assortment, and will honestly all probably be price matching eachother during the lead up to Black Friday and on the big day.</p>
