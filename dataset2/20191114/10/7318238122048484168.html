      <p>The Federal Statistical Office announced this morning that the economy had grown by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2019. Following</p>
      <p>The unexpected results were largely down to a rise in private and state consumer spending as well as a small rise in exports after a period of slowdown.</p>

      <p>A number of economists had expected a technical recession as the effects US-China trade war took their toll.
