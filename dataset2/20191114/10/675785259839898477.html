      <h2>Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic has reportedly decided his best option is a move to Manchester United - and he could make the switch before a transfer can be completed in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:45:40+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Mario Mandzukic has reportedly decided on a move to Manchester United - and he could start training with the club in December.</p>
      <p>The Croatian is tipped to complete a move from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> when the January transfer window opens amid reports sporting director Fabio Paratici flew to London this week to finalise the deal at United's London HQ.</p>
      <p>Mandzukic has not played a game this season under Maurizio Sarri and has been training away from the first team to keep up his fitness levels ahead of a move.</p>
      <p>Despite being linked with a big-money move to Qatar, <a href="https://www.tuttosport.com/">Tuttosport</a> claim Mandzukic has decided United represents his best chance to get an immediate return to first-team football.</p>
      <p>And he is prepared to start training with the Red Devils next month, before the January transfer window opens and a move can be completed, in order to ensure he is ready to make an instant impact.</p>

      <p>Juventus are said to be holding out for a €10million fee, whilst United were previously said to have offered the striker an 18-month contract worth around £85,000 per week.</p>
      <p>Mandzukic, 33, is believed to be keen on the move to resume his career having been left out in the cold in Turin.</p>
      <p>Speaking last month about the situation, Paratici told Sky Italia: "We are talking to Mandzukic to find the best possible solution.</p>

      <p>"We remain open to any scenario, so staying here or going elsewhere. We are discussing it to find the best solution for both parties."</p>
      <p>Mandzukic scored nine goals in 25 Serie A appearances last season but has been deemed surplus to requirements under new boss Sarri.</p>
      <p>He would offer a new dimension to United's attack under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, which has struggled for goals this season but recently been boosted by Anthony Martial's return.</p>
