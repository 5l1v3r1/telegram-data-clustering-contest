      <p>Plymouth is the star of Google today as the first lighting of Eddystone Lighthouse celebrates its 321st anniversary.</p>
      <p>Doodles are the changes made to the Google logo to celebrate holidays, anniversaries and the lives of famous artists, pioneers and scientists.</p>
      <p>Today it's the 321st anniversary of <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/what-its-really-like-kayak-2388046">Plymouth's Eddystone Lighthouse</a> and Google has written all about the structure's incredible history.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/history/how-lighthouse-end-up-plymouth-1471798">Henry Winstanley built the first ever Eddystone lighthouse</a>, in operation between 1698 to 1703. He was a trained engraver and mechanical inventor who managed to attract the attention of the King and Sir Christopher Wren after he was appointed as the Clerk of Works at the Royal properties at Audley End and Newmarket.</p>
      <p>The progression of technology meant that construction of the lighthouse was finally technically possible and Winstanley was the man for the job.</p>
      <p>He started work in 1696 and two years layer it was first lit – the very first offshore light to be built in the world. It was a much more decorative affair than any future versions, topped with a weather vane and with large ladders on its exterior.</p>
      <p>It even boasted a 'state room', carvings, paintings and decorative ironwork.</p>
      <p>A year later, Winstanley reinforced his creation, but in 1703 a great storm swept it into the sea. Sadly Winstanley and the five lighthouse keepers were killed in the tragedy. No trace was ever found of them.</p>

      <p>It would be five years before another lighthouse replaced it - Rudyerd’s Light which ran from 1708 to 1755.</p>
      <p>Today Google is featuring the lighthouse's history.</p>
      <p>It says: "Situated near the mouth of the English channel, the Eddystone reef is among the world’s most hazardous stretches of water, infamously known for causing numerous shipwrecks over the years. Today’s Doodle celebrates the first lighting of Eddystone Lighthouse, the first lighthouse built on those infamous rocks on this day in 1698.</p>
      <p>"It was English merchant Henry Winstanley, who’d invested in ships that sunk at Eddystone, who accepted the daunting challenge of building a much-needed lighthouse essentially in the wide open sea, 14 miles from the coast of Plymouth.</p>
      <p>"Work began in 1696 but was delayed when a French vessel arrived and took Winstanley prisoner. Although England and France were at war, the French king Louis XIV released Winstanley, saying that “France was at war with England, not with humanity." It was clear that the importance of the lighthouse transcended international conflicts.</p>

      <p>"Rising some 80 feet above the rock, the Eddystone Lighthouse was surmounted by a weather vane and domed cupola containing 60 candles and a “great hanging lamp” to warn navigators to steer clear of danger. Requiring extensive repairs after withstanding its first punishing North Atlantic winter, the lighthouse was substantially redesigned before its official completion in 1699.</p>
      <p>"Although Winstanley believed that the lighthouse could withstand 'the greatest storm that ever was,' it was destroyed during the historic Great Storm of 1703. Nevertheless, Winstanley had proved it was not just necessary but also possible and vitally important to build a lighthouse on this treacherous site, despite the extreme difficulties and dangers. A series of lighthouses have been erected in the same place since then, all of them safeguarding the lives of maritime travelers for more than three centuries."

      <h3>About Google Doodles</h3>
      <p>In 1998, before the company was even incorporated, the concept of the doodle was born when Google founders Larry and Sergey played with the corporate logo to indicate their attendance at the Burning Man Festival in the Nevada desert. They placed a stick figure drawing behind the 2nd "o" in the word, Google, and the revised logo was intended as a comical message to Google users that the founders were "out of office". While the first doodle was relatively simple, the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born.</p>

      <p>Two years later in 2000, Larry and Sergey asked current webmaster Dennis Hwang, an intern at the time, to produce a doodle for Bastille Day. It was so well received by our users that Dennis was appointed Google's chief doodler and doodles started showing up more and more regularly on the Google homepage. In the beginning, the doodles mostly celebrated familiar holidays; nowadays, they highlight a wide array of events and anniversaries.</p>
      <p>Over time, the demand for doodles has risen in the US and internationally. Creating doodles is now the responsibility of a team of talented illlustrators (we call them doodlers) and engineers. For them, creating doodles has become a group effort to enliven the Google homepage and bring smiles to the faces of Google users around the world.</p>
