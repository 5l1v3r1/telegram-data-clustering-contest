      <p>The mother of the conjoined twins Ahmed and Mohammed said it was a joy to see they had been separated. “To see Mohammad wrapped separately, I couldn't believe it, my prayers go to the doctor and his team, may their successes continue.”</p>
      <p>A video showed the emotional moment when the boys’ father saw them for the first time after the surgery. He broke down in tears before thanking the team of medics</p>

      <p>“This case comes from Libya, a country that is enduring big challenges,” Dr. Al-Rabeeah said.</p>
      <p>“It is due to our leadership’s initiative that the twins are here, to ease the suffering of the twins and of their parents - one of the humane touches of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Al-Rabeeah said the operation was the 48th to separate twins in the last 30 years and that the cases came from more than 21 countries.</p>
