      <h3>CABANATUAN CITY –  Some 126 employees of the National Irrigation Administration-Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation Systems joined yesterday morning’s simultaneous earthquake-readiness drill here and garnered a passing grade of 9 to finish the exercise within 2 minutes and 38 seconds of the alloted time for evacuation.</h3>
      <p>“Mabilis, well-coordinated at handang-handa ang ginawa ng ating participants na magduck, cover and hold mula sa operations at management division ng UPRIIS. Ang napansin lang namin ay mga hazards na salaming bintana o dividers, lalayo po tayo sa ganitong istraktura sapagkat kapag nag-ground shaking posibleng mabasag ito at tumama sa atin, kaya delikado po,” said provincial disaster officer Ace Wenceslao, one of two trainor-members of the Nueva Ecija provincial disaster risk reduction management office, who supervised the earthquake  simulation exercises at the UPRIIS grounds yesterday.</p>
      <p>Amid fears of the so-called “Big One,”Wenceslao urged the employees group which is under the supervision of UPRIIS department manager Engr. Rosalinda B. Bote to continue practicing these earthquake exercises in order to perfect the drill.<br/>Wenceslao and his asst.disaster coordinator Edgardo C. Abad gave Bote’s men a high assessment rating of 9 with 10 as the highest after finishing the drill up to the evacuation area at a fast 2 minutes and 38 seconds.</p>
      <p>Milca B. Cayanga, admin-finance division manager cited the importance of holding these simulation earthquake drills for the safety and readiness of their employees in workplaces like NIA-UPRIIS here.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s drill was conducted several hours after a 4.9 temblor hit Quirino province at 10:28 Wednesday night with an Intensity 2 quake being felt in Palayan City, Nueva Ecija.</p>
