        <i>After six years forcibly held by Australia’s offshore processing regime in Papua New Guinea, most of it incarcerated on Manus Island, the Kurdish Iranian journalist and refugee advocate Behrouz Boochani arrives in New Zealand. Boochani flew into Auckland via a convoluted route, with a one-month visa, and hopes to live in the US, which has accepted him for resettlement. 'I think this is the first time that I feel happy that I survived,' Boochani said. Asked how freedom felt, he said: 'I think I should have a smoke first.'</i>
