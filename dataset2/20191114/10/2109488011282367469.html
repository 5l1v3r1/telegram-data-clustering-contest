      <h1>Li-Fi to hit mass market in 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T10:59:25+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#yanitsaboyadzhieva" target="_blank">Yanitsa Boyadzhieva</a></address>
      <p>Li-Fi was tipped for mass-market adoption from as early as 2021, around the same time as the standard for the technology is ratified, pureLiFi CEO Alistair Banham told <i>Mobile World Live</i>.</p>
      <p>Early consumer use cases are expected to be developed in areas which are usually accompanied by constantly growing interest and demand for services including gaming, VR, AR and mixed reality.</p>
      <p>“Light can make VR truly wireless”, Banham said, explaining the technology “offers faster speeds, lower latency and interference-free wireless communications that helps overcome technology challenges allowing VR and AR products to become wire free and reliable”.</p>
      <p>The technology could also find a home in the consumer mobile handset market, he added, noting the technology’s ability to provide “1,000-times the bandwidth of the entire radio spectrum, unprecedented privacy and reliable, interference free communications”.</p>
      <p><b>Current deployment<br/></b>The company has more than 200 deployments of the technology worldwide, covering 16 different use cases, with Li-Fi particularly popular among the defence and industrial sectors “due to privacy and lack of interference”, said Banham.</p>
      <p>PureLiFi this week completed a funding round of $18 million which included involvement from Singapore-based investment company Temasek, and the Scottish Investment Bank.</p>
      <p>“This investment will allow pureLiFi to deliver Gb/s Li-Fi light antennas to the mobile device and lighting industries and bring Li-Fi closer to the hands of the consumer”, Banham stated.</p>
      <p>He added the company had already developed the products needed for Li-Fi integration into consumer devices and lighting, and is not planning another fundraising round at this stage.</p>
      <p><b>Pros and cons<br/></b>Banham highlighted the ability to deliver multi-gigabit data rates on mobile devices as among the biggest benefits of Li-Fi, noting it can currently reduce latency by three-times compared with Wi-Fi.</p>
      <p>It also addresses privacy concerns, as “light can be contained and secured in a physical space”.</p>
      <p>“The fact that Li-Fi does not work in your pocket can be seen as a downside,” Banham acknowledged: “However, there is little need for high bandwidth data communication when you’re not using your phone. This is why we don’t see Li-Fi completely replacing RF technologies.”</p>
      <p>In October 2017 the company demonstrated how the technology works by presenting the Li-Fi XC USB <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/li-fi-can-help-networks-tackle-capacity-crunch/">dongle and access point</a>. The product was later used <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/o2-looks-to-boost-connectivity-with-li-fi/">in a network trial by O2 UK</a>.</p>
      <p>Consulting company Global Market Insights projected the Li-Fi market will be worth $75 billion by 2023.</p>
