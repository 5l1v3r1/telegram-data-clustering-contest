      <p><b>Egharevba also said that</b> when the deep seaport starts operation, it would attract international investors from various parts of the world and help to boost the economy of the state.</p>
      <p><b>Work done so far:</b> Egharevba said that some key milestones had been successfully achieved such as the preparation of the port feasibility study, conduct of preliminary surveys such as the bathymetric/hydrographic survey and geotechnical survey, soil resistivity test, Met-Ocean studies, and topographic survey for the deep seaport.</p>
