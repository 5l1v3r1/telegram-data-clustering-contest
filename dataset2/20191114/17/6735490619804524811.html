      <p>Prince William and Kate Middleton are big fans of reality television.</p>
      <p>While at a charity gala on Wednesday for Centrepoint (where William stepped up his fashion game in a green velvet blazer from Reiss) he revealed his wife loves watching “Strictly Come Dancing”.</p>
      <p>Judge Shirley Ballas and host Claudia Winkleman from “Strictly”, which would be the equivalent to “Dancing With The Stars”, were at the gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of the organization that helps combat homelessness in young adults.</p>
      <p>“I have watched the show a couple of times,” the Duke of Cambridge said to Ballas after she asked if they tune-in. “Catherine is a huge fan and my mother-in-law [Carole Middleton] loves it,” he added.</p>

      <p>He then teased Winkleman, “Why does Claudia never dance?”</p>
      <p>“I’m too creaky,” she responded laughing.</p>
      <p>The star-studded night included Duran Duran, Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding, Lady Kitty Spencer and more.</p>
      <p>And William wasn’t the only member of the royal family to attend the gala, Princess Beatrice was also on-hand where she watched her cousin’s speech.</p>

      <p>“Centrepoint was one of the first charities of which I became Patron, back in 2005,” William said. “I chose to do that because visiting Centrepoint’s services with my mother made such a lasting impression on me as a child. And it still makes a lasting impression on me today.”</p>
