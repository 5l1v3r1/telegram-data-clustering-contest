      <p>VENICE: Italy was poised to declare a state of emergency for Venice on Tuesday (Nov 14) after an exceptional tide surged through churches, shops and homes, causing millions of euros worth of damage to the UNESCO city.</p>
      <p>Tourists larked around in the flooded St Mark's Square in the sunshine, snapping selfies in their neon plastic boots and taking advantage of a respite in bad weather which has driven the high tides.</p>

      <p>Sirens warning of fresh flooding rang through the canal city early Thursday but the water level remained low compared to Tuesday's tide, the highest in 50 years.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who has called the flooding "a blow to the heart of our country", met Venice's mayor and emergency services before jumping in a speed boat to visit businesses and locals affected by the tide.</p>
      <p>Residents whose houses had been hit would immediately get up to €5,000 (US$5,500) in government aid, while restaurant and shop owners could receive up to €20,000 and apply for more later, he said.</p>
      <p>Several museums remained closed to the public on Thursday.</p>
      <p>As authorities assessed the extent of the damage to Venice's cultural treasures, such as St Mark's Basilica where water invaded the crypt, locals were defiant.</p>
      <p>"It's my way of making a living, what can I do?" Stefano Gabbanoto, 54, told AFP as he opened his newspaper kiosk despite the flooding.</p>
      <p>Austrian tourist Cornelia Litschauer, 28, said she felt mixed emotions seeing Venice's famous square half submerged.</p>
      <p>"For the tourists it's amazing, it's something to see. But for the people who live here it's a real problem," Litschauer said, cradling her white Chihuahua Pablo</p>
      <p>"It's strange. Tourists are taking pictures but the city is suffering."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'NEED TO ADAPT'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Locanda Al Leon hotel said its bookings had suffered from the international media coverage of the flood, with some guests cancelling their rooms after seeing images of Venice underwater.</p>
      <p>Under the arches of the Ducal Palace, a couple from Hong Kong posed for photos in the chilly morning sun.</p>
      <p>"This (trip) was planned a long time ago so we couldn't change it," groom Jay Wong, 34, said.</p>
      <p>"Actually this is a good experience. It's an adventure."</p>

      <p>Tuesday's "acqua alta," or high waters, submerged around 80 per cent of the city, officials said.</p>
      <p>Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94 metres in 1966.</p>
      <p>Many, including Venice's mayor, have blamed the disaster on climate change and warned that Italy - a country prone to natural disasters - must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons.</p>
      <p>"We need to be resilient and adapt. We need a policy that looks at the climate through completely different eyes," Environment Minister Sergio Costa said on Thursday (Nov 14).</p>

      <p>Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has estimated the damage to Venice at hundreds of millions of euros.</p>
      <p>The Serenissima, as the floating city is called, is home to a mere 50,000 residents but receives 36 million global visitors each year.</p>
      <p>A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been under way since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays.</p>
      <p>"This engineering solution that will end up costing nearly €6 billion has got to work," Transport Minister Paola De Micheli said.</p>
      <p>The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice's lagoon during high tides - but a recent attempt to test part of it caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered it had rusted.</p>
