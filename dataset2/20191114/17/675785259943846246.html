      <h1>Joshua Kimmich becomes latest Bayern Munich star to admit he'd like Pep Guardiola return</h1>
      <h2>Niko Kovac was sacked by the Bavarian giants at the start of the month following a humiliating 5-1 loss to Frankfurt and they are yet to name his replacement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:11:37+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Bayern Munich right back Joshua Kimmich said he would enjoy a reunion with Pep Guardiola as rumours continue to grow linking the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss with a return to Germany.</p>
      <p>Guardiola spent three season at Munich between 2013-2016, winning three Bundesliga titles, two German Cups, a UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Hansi Flick is currently in charge on an interim basis following the departure of Niko Kovac, and although Kimmich said he was behind his current boss, he couldn't deny the attraction of a potential return for Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Germany's game against Belarus on Saturday, Kimmich said: "Regarding Pep Guardiola I have no idea what Bayern's plan is with Hansi Flick.</p>

      <p>"At first you thought that we would get a new coach after the international break. Now, we won both games with Flick and it sounds like he will stay until winter or even the entire season. What happens then is the business of the club â€“ we players have nothing to do with it.</p>
      <p>"But of course, I know (Guardiola) and have a lot to thank him for. He took me from the second division and let me play in the Bundesliga. We won the double together and after that season I became a player for Germany. So, of course, I won't be against him coming back."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Guardiola would fancy going back to Germany, but he is going through one of his toughest spell as City manager, with his side now nine points behind Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , and the Catalan has never managed a club for more than three years.</p>

      <p>Recently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bayern-munich-told-pep-guardiola-20881624">Bayern legend Lothar Matthaus urged the club to pursue Guardiola.</a></p>
      <p>He told Bild: "If Bayern want to play possession football, there is no better solution than Guardiola.</p>
      <p>"It would be a win for Bayern Munich and for the Bundesliga."</p>
