      <h1>Nottingham's new Winter Wonderland Ice Bar has a frozen air hockey table and much more - see inside</h1>
      <h2>We popped down to Old Market Square for a first look ahead of its opening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:19:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>By the very nature of its substance, no two <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas?pageNumber=2">Nottingham Winter Wonderland</a> Ice Bars have ever been the same.</p>
      <p>But this year its creators have pulled something completely new out of their box of tricks and ice picks.</p>
      <p>An air hockey table, made entirely from ice, which punters can actually play, will surely be the runaway hit of the magical Yuletide hideaway.</p>
      <p>The bespoke <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/pubs-and-bars-in-nottingham">bar</a> game is just one of the attractions at the city's coolest pop-up boozer.</p>
      <p>Keeping with an Alpine theme there is also a bobsleigh - with enough room for up to five people to park themselves on the faux fur rugs and practise their best Cool Runnings impressions - a snowboarder sculpture, supersize beer glass, ice sofas and a pint-drinking grizzly bear.</p>

      <p>"We start planning the theme very early," says Edward Mellors, a director of the Mellors Group who run Winter Wonderland in partnership with Nottingham City Council.</p>
      <p>"After last year's one we probably started thinking about it in January or February. I just throw a few suggestions at the guys and they come up with the ideas."</p>
      <p>"The guys" are award-winning sculptors Sand in your Eye - the team behind director Danny Boyle's moving Armistice Day Pages of the Sea sand portraits.</p>
      <p>As well as ice and sand they also create phenomenal pumpkin carvings and the artwork for the Tour De Yorkshire. It is the fourth year they've been involved with the frosty pop-up attraction, which is carved out of 13 tonnes of solid ice.</p>
      <p>In the last four years, the ice bar has grown to twice its original size, and included Lapland and Narnia themes.</p>

      <p>Edward says: "We listen to feedback and try to change and tweak it each year. After the first year we could see there was a demand for it so that gave us the confidence to invest more into it.</p>
      <p>"Then we had the bar in the middle with stools around it to encourage people to sit and drink but that made it more difficult for others to order drinks, so we moved it to the corner. But that was a little out the way. I think this is the best we've done yet, the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>"It feels a lot bigger."</p>
      <p>If you can brave it, entry allows up to an hour inside including two drinks (£13) or two drinks and a glass of fizz (£16).</p>
      <p>It will be open from Friday, November 15 until New Year's Eve, when the sad process of melting it down begins.</p>
      <p>Edwards says: "We literally turn the heating on and watch it go."</p>
