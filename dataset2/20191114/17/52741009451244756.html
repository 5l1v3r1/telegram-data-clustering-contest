      <p>MADRID — Spain’s government announced Thursday that Catalan poet Joan Margarit won the 2019 Cervantes Prize, the Spanish-speaking world's highest literary honour.</p>
      <p>Margarit, who is also an architect, has published more than 20 volumes of poetry — mainly in Catalan but also in Spanish. The 81-year-old has won several awards for his verse, including the Pablo Neruda prize in Chile.</p>
      <p>“If a poem cannot console a person in a difficult situation then it is not worth anything,” Margarit told Spanish news agency Europa Press after hearing he had won the Cervantes Prize.</p>
      <p>The jury said Margarit “has enriched both the Spanish and the Catalan language and represents the plurality of our culture.”</p>
      <p>Catalan, along with Spanish, is spoken in Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia.</p>
      <p>The award for Margarit comes amid an increase in tensions in Catalonia over its separatist movement.</p>
      <p>Asked about the political situation in Catalonia, the poet said he was “tired” of it.</p>
      <p>The 125,000-euro ($137,600) award generally alternates between Spanish and Latin American writers.</p>
      <p>Uruguayan poet Ida Vitale won in 2018.</p>
      <p>The prizes are presented each April 23 on the anniversary of the death in 1616 of Miguel de Cervantes, author of "Don Quixote," in a ceremony attended by King Felipe VI.</p>
