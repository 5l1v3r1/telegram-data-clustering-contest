      <p>FRANKFURT: Daimler said Thursday (Nov 14) it planned to cut jobs to save more than €1 billion (US$1.1 billion) by the end of 2022, as the German luxury carmaker grapples with an expensive switch to greener vehicles.</p>
      <p>The Mercedes-Benz maker has also been hit by <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/daimler-recalls-hundreds-of-thousands-of-mercedes-benz-diesel-vehicles-11993678">expensive recalls</a>, a slowing global market and a €870 million <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/daimler-faces-up-to-1-billion-euro-diesel-fine--der-spiegel-11797070">fine in September</a> for having sold vehicles that did not conform with legal emissions limits.</p>

      <p>"By the end of 2022, Mercedes-Benz Cars plans to save more than €1 billion in personnel costs. To this end, jobs are to be reduced," the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The expanded range of plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles is leading to cost increases that will have a negative impact on Mercedes-Benz Cars' return on sales," it added.</p>
      <p>Like its rivals, the Stuttgart-based firm is spending billions in the shift towards the electric, autonomous vehicles of the future.</p>
      <p>The German car industry as a whole is confronting weaker-than-expected growth, weighed down by US-China trade conflicts and Brexit uncertainty.</p>
      <p>The setbacks pushed Daimler into a net loss of €1.2 billion in the second quarter, its first three-month loss in 10 years.</p>
      <p>The company did not say how many jobs would be cut.</p>
      <p>But the Sueddeutsche Zeitung last week reported, citing an email sent to staff by the group's works council, that it would cut 1,100 management jobs worldwide.</p>
