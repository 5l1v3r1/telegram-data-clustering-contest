      <p>Trading on <a href="https://www.okex.com/">OKEx</a> just became even more exciting following the inclusion of USDT-Margined Futures on the platform. The new virtual derivative product went live today, following an earlier successful simulation that started on November 5, 2019. The new USDT-Margined Futures is available with attractive leverage levels ranging between 0.01x to 100x.</p>
      <p>According to OKEx’s statement, the BTC/USDT futures product will be quoted and settled in USDT while the contract face value is set at 0.0001 BTC. With this instrument, traders can now aim to profit from the performance of USDT by <a href="https://blog.okex.com/2019/11/08/usdt-margined-futures-or-token-margined-futures/">longing or shorting the position</a> based on whether the cryptocurrency’s price is increasing or decreasing in the market. The BTC/USDT futures on OKEx will be available for trade round the clock, with a daily settlement process that is set to happen every day at 8:00 UTC.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the simulation carried out for BTC/USDT futures, CEO of OKEx Jay Hao said “The simulation of our USDT Futures Contract was very successful, and we received positive feedback from traders in the OKEx Community. At OKEx, we’ve developed a safe, reliable, and stable environment for cryptocurrency trading and strive to offer new services based on our customers’ interests. We’re excited to add USDT linear contract to our Futures market and next on the Perpetual Swap market to meet the interests of out growing international user base.”</p>
      <p>The OKEx USDT Futures Contracts comes with its own set of advantages and some of them are listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The OKEx USDT Futures is a linear contract that doesn’t need the traders to hedge the margin risk of inverse contracts.</li>
        <li>Known for high efficiency and low-cost, traders don’t have to deal with the hassle of switching between cryptocurrencies while trading this particular instrument.</li>
        <li>It is comparatively stable, which reduces the risks induced by the volatility of collateral’s price for future contracts and simpler calculations.</li>
        <li>Like all OKEx instruments, the USDT Futures also come with an intuitive trading experience which is similar to spot trading with additional leverage. Users can easily master this type of trading system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Further, OKEx has also adopted an <a href="https://blog.okex.com/2019/05/31/perfecting-okex-futures-market/">enhanced risk management system</a> for derivatives. The Mark Price system helps avoid huge fluctuations and unusual liquidation events. Similarly, the Tiered Maintenance Margin Ratio (TMMR) System is designed to avoid liquidation of large positions and its after-effect on market liquidity. There is also Forced Partial Liquidation Mode built-in which eliminates market impact caused by large number of liquidated orders.</p>
      <p>While the USDT-margined futures market is currently available with BTC market, OKEx will be including support for other major cryptocurrencies like EOS, ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP, ETC, TRX and BSV in the near future.</p>
