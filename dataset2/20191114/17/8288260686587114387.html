      <h2>Blues were docked nine points for breaking P&amp;S guidelines at the end of a case which ran for eight months and which hung over the whole 2018/2019 campaign</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:51:23+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Sheffield Wednesday have been charged with misconduct by the English Football League after selling their ground to Dejphon Chansiri to try to avoid breaking spending rules.</p>
      <p>The Owls sold Hillsborough to their owner for about £60m, helping them record a pre-tax profit of £2.5m for 2017-18.</p>
      <p>Selling a ground is not against the rule but the charges relate to ‘how and when’ it was sold and its inclusion in the 2018 accounts when it was sold a year later.</p>
      <p>Wednesday say they will ‘vigorously defend’ the charges.</p>

      <p>An EFL statement said: “Following a formal investigation into financial information provided by Sheffield Wednesday in relation to the Club’s 2017/18 Profitability and Sustainability (P&amp;S) submission, the EFL has today issued a number of charges relating to alleged breaches of EFL Rules.</p>
      <p>“Earlier this year the EFL launched an investigation into the Club’s financial submission for the period ending July 2018 under the relevant P&amp;S Rules following the completion of the sale of Hillsborough Stadium.</p>
      <p>“The EFL has reviewed a large number of documents obtained from the Club as part of this process and concluded there is sufficient evidence to justify issuing charges of Misconduct.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The charges are in respect of a number of allegations regarding the process of how and when the stadium was sold and the inclusion of the profits in the 2017/18 accounts.</p>
      <p>“All charges will be considered by an independent Disciplinary Commission and, if the charges are proven, the Commission can impose any of the sanctions set out in EFL Regulation 92.2.</p>
      <p>“The EFL Board has previously agreed and communicated with all Championship Clubs a set of sanctioning guidelines, but the Commission, under EFL Regulations, has the ability to invoke a full range of sanctions should the breach be confirmed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The EFL continues to review the Club’s 2018/19 P&amp;S submissions.</p>
      <p>“As these matters are now subject to proceedings, the EFL will be making no further comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>One of those sanctions is a points deduction - the same fate that befell Birmingham City last season - when, both coincidentally and ironically current Wednesday manager Garry Monk was in charge.</p>

      <p>Wednesday put out their own short statement: “Sheffield Wednesday note the statement issued today by the EFL and the charges contained within.</p>
      <p>“These charges will be vigorously defended and the Club will be making no further comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>The Owls are currently eighth in the league, on 25 points, three outside the play-offs.</p>
