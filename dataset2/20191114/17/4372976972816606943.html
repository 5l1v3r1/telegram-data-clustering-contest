      <h1>Tesla sedans regain recommended status in Consumer Reports reliability survey</h1>
      <h2>Model X still drags down Tesla's brand ranking</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:09:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>DETROIT — <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/model+3/">Tesla's Model 3</a> and S sedans both regained "recommended" status in <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm">Consumer Reports magazine's</a> annual <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/tesla-model-3-model-s-regain-consumer-reports-recommendation/">reliability survey</a>, allowing the electric carmaker's overall standing to rise slightly.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/">Tesla's</a> ranking improved four spots to No. 23 out of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars/">30 brands in the U.S. market</a> as it worked to resolve production problems with the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/model+3/">Model 3</a>, said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a>. Both the Model 3 and S raised their reliability ratings to "average."</p>
      <p>"People really like their cars," he said of Tesla owners. "Hopefully, if that frantic rate of change can slow down a bit, they can maintain reliability."</p>
      <p>Tesla has touted the popularity of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/model+s/">Model S</a>, listed in the top ranks of a different Consumer Reports survey, on owner satisfaction, every year since 2013 when the carmaker was first included.</p>
      <p>Fisher cautioned he expected Tesla's reliability to remain fluid given its inconsistent track record.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tesla/model+x/">Tesla's Model X</a> SUV still ranks among the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/10-least-reliable-cars/">least reliable models</a>, according to the annual survey released on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The poll predicts which <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/research/">new cars</a> will give owners fewer or more problems, based on data collected for more than 400,000 vehicles. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.</p>
      <p>Twenty individual vehicle models gained "recommended" status. Meanwhile, a dozen vehicles lost that status — notable among them was the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/cars-lose-consumer-reports-recommendation-over-reliability-issues/">bestselling vehicle in the U.S., the Ford F-150</a>, with owners reporting problems with the transmission, 4WD components and infotainment.</p>
      <p>Reliability rankings tend to suffer when automakers offer new or redesigned models, which dragged down <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> AG's namesake and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/audi/">Audi</a> brands. The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/volkswagen/">VW</a> brand slid nine spots to No. 27, while Audi fell seven spots to No. 14.</p>
      <p>Brands with no major changes to their lineups, such as <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/fiat/">Fiat</a> Chrysler Automobiles' <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/">Dodge</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chrysler/">Chrysler</a>, made significant gains. Dodge was the highest-ranked U.S. brand at No. 8, making the biggest gain of 13 spots. Chrysler rose seven spots to No. 19, while Jeep finished at No. 26.</p>
      <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F">Ford Motor Co's</a> Lincoln and Ford brands were No. 15 and 16, while <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a>' Buick, GMC, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands ranked No. 18, 22, 25 and last at 30, respectively.</p>
      <p>The reliability of full-sized pickups, the most popular vehicles in the U.S. market, was weak. Ford's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/f_150/">F-150</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/fca/">FCA's</a> Ram trucks were rated "well below average," while <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">GM's</a> pickups — the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra — both had "below average" reliability.</p>
      <p>Toyota's Lexus luxury brand finished atop the survey, followed by Mazda and the Toyota brand.</p>
