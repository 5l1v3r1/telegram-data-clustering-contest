      <h1>Google Cloud’s Contact Center AI hits general availability</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:39:55+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/kjohnson/" target="_blank">Khari Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Google Cloud is making Contact Center AI generally available for use today. The cloud service is built with conversational AI engine Dialogflow to automate interactions with customers in call centers.</p>
      <p>Contact Center AI contains Virtual Agent to automatically respond to customer queries with voice or text or handoff the conversation to a person when a bot is unable to help a customer. Agent Assist uses natural language processing to augment customer service agent interactions with customers when a bot is unable to help a customer.</p>
      <p>The news comes today as Google pushed its rich communication services (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/23/probeat-googles-rcs-business-messaging-push-is-too-much-too-early/">RCS</a>) <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/rcs/upgrading-messaging-android-us-rcs/">to Android Messages users in the United States</a>, and days after Google’s experimental unit Area 120 <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/12/google-now-lets-businesses-customize-calljoy-the-automated-telephone-customer-service-agent/">CallJoy service for answering phone calls and customer questions for small businesses</a> got an upgrade.</p>

      <p>The series of announcements preclude the start of the Google Cloud Next conference in London next week. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/24/google-announces-automl-vision-natural-language-translation-and-call-center-ai/">Google launched Contact Center AI</a> at a Cloud Next conference in summer 2018.</p>
