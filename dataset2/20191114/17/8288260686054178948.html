      <h1>Watch as Mercedes abandoned in flash floods in Hall Green - with its lights left on</h1>
      <h2>Despite a cordon and flashing signs, drivers are still attempting to drive through the notorious Green Road in Hall Green</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:38:46+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">birminghammail.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>A Mercedes was abandoned after a driver tried and failed to cross a notorious flooding flashpoint as Birmingham was deluged by hours of rain.</p>
      <p>The car was almost completely submerged at the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/notorious-flood-hotspot-claims-another-16973840">Ford on Green Road in Hall Green</a> - despite red flashing signs saying ‘Caution, do not cross’ and a cordon.</p>
      <p>A video was taken at 4.20pm on Thursday (November 14) by Archie Yoxall, who said it was the second abandoned car he had seen at the same spot today.</p>
      <p>The abandoned Mercedes still had its lights on.</p>

      <p>Mr Yoxall, a 20-year-old photographer, said: “I was literally walking past on my way home from the station and it was stuck there.</p>
      <p>“The windows were open so I’m assuming someone had climbed out. <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/100-schools-closed-across-west-17257137">They must’ve got out that way.</a></p>
      <p>"The area is taped off to stop people driving through. But even though there are signs flashing, people are still trying to get through.</p>
      <p>“There was another car stuck in the same place earlier today. It’s every other week, every time it rains or floods, people are stuck in there.”</p>

      <p>Kings Norton Fire Station tweeted: “Don’t attempt to drive through fords. Incident Kings Norton blue attended to today at Green road, Springfield. Please avoid.”</p>
      <p>There are currently six flood warnings in place for Birmingham and Solihull this evening after the region was battered by heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Green Road in Hall Green has often seen flooding scenes.</p>
      <p>On October 27, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/twits-people-stunned-three-cars-17154360">three cars were left overnight</a> after they ended up stuck in the same place following torrential rain.</p>

      <p>Brian Norton, managing director of nearby factory Indestructible Paint Ltd, said at the time: “I was driving to our factory this morning to check on the flooding and couldn’t believe it when I saw not one but three cars stuck in the ford.</p>
      <p>“There are flooding lights that flash to warn people not to go through there when the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/watch-bristol-road-south-under-17257301">water levels are high</a> so these drivers must have ignored them and carried on anyway.</p>
      <p>“If one car has got stuck, you’d think others would stop going.</p>
      <p>"They’re twits! It’s just daft to try to drive through a flooded river. I drive a 4x4 and I wouldn’t risk it. You just don’t, they’re not submarines.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The trouble is that the fire service then has to come and rescue them, I’ve seen it happen before. They have to bring out the deep water rescue unit, make risk assessments and go to them in rubber boats."</p>
