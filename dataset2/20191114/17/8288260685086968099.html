      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers transfer news | WWFC reporter Alex Dicken takes a look at the areas Nuno will be looking to strengthen</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are preparing for what should be their costliest January transfer window under <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo.</a></p>
      <p>Nuno has never been one to splash the cash in January and in two previous winter windows under the Portuguese <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> have spent less than £2million on permanent deals.</p>
      <p>Spanish striker Rafa Mir is the only player Nuno has asked Fosun to fund in January but Wolves are now targeting players of a much higher calibre.</p>
      <p>Owners Fosun have already moved to reassure supporters that they are ready to back Nuno in January - but chairman <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jeff-shi">Jeff Shi</a> has also shed some light on the complexities of the modern day transfer market.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“We are always ready to invest,” <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/wolves-chairman-jeff-shi-reveals-17178293">Shi said.</a> “Don’t worry about it. If we need to strengthen the squad of course we have the capacity to do that in January.</p>
      <p>“The philosophy of the club is to do the right deal. We don’t want to do something wrong and spend some money on a player who never plays well. You can see some examples at other clubs so I hope we can avoid that.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes the market doesn’t help. For example, in the last window many players who had played well for only one or two seasons were valued at 60, 70, 80 million.</p>
      <p>“I feel a little bit frustrated about the market inflation but we are still working very hard. Our scouting team are working really hard around Europe and the world to find good talent to help us.</p>
      <p>“We are strong and we know where we are maybe a little bit weak, and I keep talking to Nuno about it. I think we will have a good window in January.”</p>

      <h3>January priorities</h3>
      <p>The recent injury to star defender Willy Boly has forced Nuno's hand. Wolves were already looking to sign a defender with Ryan Bennett out of favour and summer signing Jesus Vallejo not performing anything like Nuno hoped he would, but Boly’s injury has accelerated that process.</p>
      <p>A high quality centre-back is the most pressing priority on Nuno’s list, of that there is no question.</p>
      <p>Wolves have looked a little light in midfield this season, especially when Nuno has played 3-5-2. There were plans to strengthen midfield in the summer and that is still the case should a high quality player become available at the right price.</p>

      <p>With Leander Dendoncker needed in defence at present, Wolves have a two-man midfield of Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves. Beneath that Nuno only has youngsters Morgan Gibbs-White, Bruno Jordao and Taylor Perry.</p>
      <p>Given head of recruitment John Marshall’s recent comments to Italian news outlet TMW, it would seem that strengthening in midfield is not a necessity.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Wolves could rekindle their interest in long-term target Franck Kessie, Marshall responded: "I don't think so, we have so many players in midfield."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Long-term planning</h3>
      <p>Goalkeeper is a position Wolves are scouting with the long-term in mind and a selection of players have been watched over the last few months.</p>
      <p>Undisputed number one Rui Patricio has been better than ever this season but understudy John Ruddy’s contract expires at the end of this season.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear whether Ruddy will continue to play second fiddle at Molineux, while Will Norris is currently on loan at League One club Ipswich Town.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>John Ruddy has barely played since Rui Patricio joined Wolves</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If Ruddy leaves at the end of his contract Wolves are certain to bring a new custodian to WV1.</p>
      <p>Right wing-back was a position which was discussed at the end of last season with Matt Doherty lacking competition.</p>
      <p>Adama Traore proved himself a capable deputy early on this season but the Spanish winger has since returned to his more natural position in Wolves’ front three.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>With that in mind, Wolves could look to sign a competitor for Doherty in the long-term. Royal Antwerp right-back Aurelio Buta, who started his career with Benfica, is a player Wolves are understood to have watched.</p>
      <p>Wolves are generally quite light on the right side of attack following the summer exits of Helder Costa and Ivan Cavaleiro. Pedro Neto can deputise for Traore but he prefers to play on the left. Now Wolves are playing 3-4-3 another right-sided forward would bring balance to the squad.</p>
      <p>These are by no means urgent priorities, though, just areas which are likely to need improving in the medium term.</p>
