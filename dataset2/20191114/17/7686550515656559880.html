      <h1>The rugby evening headlines as Wales' 60-cap rule debated again while another Rugby World Cup winner bows out</h1>
      <h2>Some wanted a 75-cap rule</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:29:15+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Orders</a></address>
      <p>Here are your evening headlines for Thursday, November 14.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gatland says Wales rule on exiles should be cut to 30 caps</b>
      </p>
      <p>Warren Gatland believes exiled Wales players who have 30 or more caps should be allowed to play for their country.</p>
      <p>Such a move would make Toulon's Rhys Webb, who has 31 caps, available for national duties once again.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the Welsh Rugby Union scrapped the old ‘Gatland’s Law’ selection policy and introduced a new rule affecting players taking contracts outside Wales. The big change was that exiled players needed to have 60 or more caps to be eligible to pull on the red jersey.</p>
      <p>But former Wales coach Gatland says he always felt the limit was set too high, and that it should have been cut back to 30 caps.</p>
      <p>"I still felt desperately that Rhys Webb, every inch a scrum-half of international calibre, has fallen victim to our 60-cap rule which states that for people playing their rugby outside Wales, only those with that number of Test appearances or more can be picked for their country", the 56-year-old writes in his new autobiography, Pride and Passion.</p>
      <p>"Rhys had already agreed to join Toulon when the rule was introduced in 2017. He could have pulled out of the deal and remained available to Wales but to his credit he felt he had made a commitment to the French club and should honour it.</p>
      <p>"I can't pretend I agree with the situation and I've made my feelings known, but as some influential figures in Welsh rugby originally wanted a 75-cap cut-off, it was never going to be an easy argument to win."</p>
      <p>WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips reckons the existing policy has worked but indicated to WalesOnline in the summer that the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-rugby-team-60-cap-16827008">union did intend to review the rule</a> .</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sonny Bill is in the money</b>
      </p>
      <p>He has starred in NRL, Super Rugby, Japan and the Top 14 over the past decade and a half, so Sonny Bill Williams could have been forgiven for quietly playing out the remainder of his career.</p>
      <p>But the All Black is up for one final challenge, for he has joined Toronto Wolfpack RLF to complete in Super League.</p>
      <p>He will earn a reputed £2.6 million a year over two seasons to become the highest-paid player in either rugby code.</p>
      <p>“As a man of faith, I just really believe this is meant to be. My wife is probably a bit upset that she is going to have to move all four kids over here but after talking with her I am really excited. It all came to fruition really quickly,” said Williams.</p>
      <p>“I am a sportsman but I need to have a purpose and something I believe in. After speaking to Brian [McDermott, Toronto coach] his philosophy on how he wants to play the game – I can be really suited to his style.</p>
      <p>“It’s a journey — there’s a bit of pressure there but it’s so exciting. What they are trying to achieve on and off the field is special. What if we succeed and what if I am a part of that?”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Goodbye, Schalk</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Africa hooker Schalk Brits has announced his retirement from rugby — again.</p>
      <p>The talented No. 2 first declared his intention to bow out in May 2018 after departing Saracens, only to be coaxed back by Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus.</p>
      <p>But this time the 38-year-old can see the finish line.</p>
      <p>"To say Schalk is a team player would be underestimating the massive role he played in our success, and for that I can only thank him," said Erasmus, who guided South Africa to World Cup final success over England.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s isn’t quite the end, mind.</p>
      <p>He is set to figure for the Barbarians Brazil and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/wales-face-another-rugby-world-17217207">against Wales</a> this month and will try to appear for Cambridge in the 2020 varsity match against Oxford.</p>
      <p>Departing Fiji boss predicts bright future for the islanders</p>
      <p>Fiji general manager Geoff Webster is departing the role with high hopes that the islanders can go from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>Despite producing some spectacular rugby, Semi Radradra, Leone Nakarawa and Co exited the World Cup at the pool stage yet again.</p>
      <p>But Webster believes Fiji are a rugby country on the up.</p>
      <p>“The foundations for sustained performance are now in place,” he insisted.</p>
      <p>“I expect a good number of young prospects to kick on and make their mark.</p>
      <p>“A vibrant, professional Fiji can only enhance the code globally.”</p>
      <p>Webster is standing down to spend more time with his family.</p>

        <b>Young regional player earns big praise</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ospreys youngster Morgan Morris has wasted no time making a mark in senior rugby, with <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/unknown-rugby-player-whos-been-17250260">plaudits coming in for his efforts</a> this season.</p>

      <p>Both Dan Lydiate and the region’s head coach Allen Clarke named-checked the 21-year-old at the media’s press conference this week and his former director of rugby at Swansea, Richard Lancaster, added his name to the list of endorsements.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s in doubt he’ll prove a very good player for the Ospreys,” said Lancaster.</p>
      <p>“It’s then a question of how far he can go from there.</p>
      <p>“That’s up to him, then.</p>
      <p>“But in terms of attitude, he’s first class.”</p>
