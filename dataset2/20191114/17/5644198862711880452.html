      <p>HONG KONG: Asian markets fluctuated on Thursday (Nov 14) following another Wall Street record as Donald Trump hailed progress in US-China trade talks, while eyes were also on Hong Kong as violent protests continued.</p>
      <p>Trading floors were edgy, with very few details from Washington and Beijing on negotiations for their mini tariffs agreement.</p>

      <p>Trump's comments on Wednesday that "our trade agreement with China is moving along very rapidly" provided some support, though observers said markets were looking for something more concrete to buy into.</p>
      <p>"Let's not forget that as long ago as June we were told that a US-China trade deal was 90 per cent of the way there," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.</p>
      <p>"Yet since then we've seen new tariffs applied to Chinese goods, albeit with some exemptions, with a new set of tariffs still expected to kick in on December 15."</p>
      <p>Equities have seen healthy rallies in recent weeks on optimism the two sides would soon reach a partial deal as part of a wider agreement to end a long-running trade war that has hit the global economy.</p>
      <p>Michelle Girard, chief US economist at NatWest Markets, told Bloomberg TV: "We've been pushing back on a lot of this trade optimism and it's felt kind of lonely because markets have certainly embraced the news that we might have a short-term deal.</p>
      <p>"We are not there yet."</p>
      <p>Adding to the unease was a report that China was hesitating over aspects of the deal, which came after Trump dismissed Beijing's claims last week they had a plan to roll back some tariffs as the talks progressed.</p>

        <b>FRESH HONG KONG UNREST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tokyo fell 0.8 per cent after data showed Japan's economy grew at a slower pace than forecast in the third quarter as it was hit by trade wars.</p>
      <p>Taipei eased 0.2 per cent, Manila dropped 0.6 per cent, Singapore shed 0.3 per cent, Jakarta sank more than one per cent and Mumbai was flat.</p>
      <p>But Shanghai added 0.2 per cent as dealers brushed off fresh data pointing to weakness in the Chinese economy. Retail sales, fixed-asset investment and industrial production figures all missed expectations as the country is weighed by the trade war and slowing global demand.</p>
      <p>Sydney rose 0.6 per cent, Seoul edged up 0.4 per cent and Wellington put on 0.6 per cent.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong tumbled 0.9 per cent following another night of unrest in the city, which has seen a pick-up in violence since the weekend, while on Thursday protesters blocked roads in certain districts - closing businesses - and disrupted public transport for a fourth day.</p>
      <p>The standoff has hammered the Hang Seng Index - which had lost around four per cent by Wednesday night - while there are concerns about possible intervention by Beijing. Property firms were again in the firing line, with big-names including Henderson Land and Sun Hung Kai Properties down around one percent.</p>
      <p>There was little reaction to the head of the Federal Reserve saying he did not expect the central bank to lift interest rates for a fourth time this year, and that the economy would probably continue to grow but faced risks from a global slowdown and trade disputes.</p>
      <p>In the first of two days of congressional testimony, Jerome Powell also urged lawmakers to take action on the rising US debt and deficit to ensure continued growth.</p>
      <p>On currency markets, the Chilean peso was sitting at a record low 795 to the dollar, forcing the country's central bank to pump US$4 billion into financial markets for support.</p>
      <p>The unit has been battered by nearly four weeks of protests against the economic policies of right-wing President Sebastian Pinera.</p>
      <p>The euro was inched up against the pound and dollar followig data showing Germany, the European Union's biggest economy, had averted a recession in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>In early trade London dipped 0.1 per cent, Paris was flat and Frankfurt shed 0.2 per cent.</p>
