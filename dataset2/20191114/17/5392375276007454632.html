      <p>Selection of Xiaomi products is already almost enough to fully supply your household with more or less everything needed and the portfolio still keeps expanding. Not that long ago they have released in their ecosystem a very interesting 3D shaver Enchén under the umbrella of crowdfunded Youpin products, but now it’s time to get an upgrade. And well the new Xiaomi Enchén BlackStone 3 looks even better and you can still get it for a very good price, for example from <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/ebay">Ebay</a>. So let’s take a quick look.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi Enchén BlackStone 3 resembles in many way its predecessor so you can once again expect an electric shaver with three independent 3D shaving heads with dual-ring blade net for perfect shave. On top of that you are getting ESM smart shaving system against the beard getting stuck, 5W strong motor with just 67dB low noise operation, IPX7 waterproof rating for fully washable product, support for both wet and dry shaving, 150 minute long running time on a battery charge, USB Type-C charging, battery capacity display and travel lock function. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=254418924327">All that for mere $20.39</a> so it’s a perfect cheap gadget for trimming, shaving and maintaining your beard.</p>

      <p>And from the depths of Ebay we dug out another interesting product today to round up the presented duo. The Q Plus smart TV box can deliver quite a powerful punch for a very low price, so would be a shame to miss it. Equipped with Allwinner H6 chipset, 4 GB RAM and 32 GB / 64 GB of internal storage it supports up to 6K resolution with H.265 decoding (6K@30fps) and of course with HDR, CEC and HDCP 2.2 functions. Powered by Android 9 Pie OS you are also getting USB 3.0 port or 100M LAN port for connectivity or 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi. And the best comes with the pricing, because for the basic 32 GB version you <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=223728417308">are paying only $29.64 and for the 64 GB one only $33.33</a>.</p>
