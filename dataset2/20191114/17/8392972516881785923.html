      <h1>Five reasons The Bill NEEDS to come back to screens</h1>
      <h2>The drama ran from 1984 until 2010</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:01:09+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Carena Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Since police serial drama The Bill ended in 2010 there's been a big police-shaped hole in our weekly viewing.</p>
      <p>The characters and storylines were brilliant, the theme tune was even better, and the closing credits were epic.</p>
      <p>We've still got two long-running hospital dramas on BBC in the shape of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/drama-tv/casualty/">Casualty</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/drama-tv/holby-city/">Holby City</a>, so surely there's room for The Bill to come back?</p>
      <p>UKTV Drama channel is currently re-running all 2,421 episodes</p>
      <p>But we think it's ready for a reboot. Here's five reasons why it's time to take us back to the mean streets of Sun Hill.</p>
      <h3>1. The theme tune and closing credits were legendary</h3>
      <p>We're not talking about when they revamped it in the noughties and changed everything.</p>
      <p>We're going old school, with the classic theme tune over the closing credits as two police officers plodded along side by side.</p>
      <p>It was epic, legendary and iconic. Bring it back just for this.</p>

      <h3>2. It was realistic</h3>

      <p>Step aside Phil Mitchell, Jim Carver might just be battling you for your crown of 'best alcoholic acting in Soapland'.</p>
      <p>The stories The Bill put out during its twice-weekly outings were gritty, they felt real, and the characters were instantly relatable.</p>
      <p>From Jim Carver's drink problem, which saw him almost lose his job before he managed to overcome his demons and return to the team, to the Don Beech scandal and the Burnside era, every story had us gripped.</p>
      <p>The realism even went so far as to use authentic police uniforms, which meant the production team had to lock the clothes away in secure conditions to stop them getting into the wrong hands.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://drama.uktv.co.uk/the-bill/article/six-things-you-didnt-know-about-bill/">UKTV Drama website</a>, when the show finished in 2010, the Metropolitan Police had to buy all the uniforms, including stab-proof vests for the same reason.</p>
      <p>See, real.</p>
      <h3>3. It would definitely reflect the crime rates today</h3>
      <p>There's so much crime going on in real life, especially in London where The Bill was set, there would be even more stories to tell today.</p>
      <p>The face of crime has changed considerably since The Bill finished in 2010. 2018 saw 132 homicides in London alone, and by September 2019 there had been 110 violent killings in the capital, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8104412/london-stabbings-2019-knife-crime-statistics/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingjune2019"> Office for National Statistics</a> shows that there has been a 15% rise in fraud crime across the country, a 4% increase in offences involving firearms, and a 7% increase in the number of incidents involving knives or sharp instruments up to June 2019.</p>
      <p>So, what better time to educate the public and show them exactly what the police force does than with a long-running drama show like The Bill?</p>
      <p>Police dramas these days run over six or eight episodes and tell the story of one crime.</p>
      <p>The beauty of The Bill would be that it could tell all sorts of crime stories all at once, encapsulating everything that's going on in the country at the moment.</p>
      <h3>4. We'd love to see all the old favourites reunited</h3>

      <p>Sgt June Ackland, DCI Frank Burnside, DS Jim Carver, Sgt Bob Cryer, Inspector Dale Smith (aka Smithy) we would LOVE to see them all reunited on screen.</p>
      <p>Most of them have gone off doing other things, but we're sure they could be persuaded to at least pop up in a rebooted The Bill.</p>
      <p>Alex Walkinshaw, who played Smithy, is now in Holby City as Director of Nursing Services Adrian 'Fletch' Fletcher (having previously played the same role in Casualty).</p>
      <p>Trudie Goodwin (June Ackland) was in Emmerdale for a time as Georgia Sharma, but she hasn't been seen since 2015. She's also appeared in an episode of Casualty and was most recently seen alongside fellow former Bill cast member, Lisa Maxwell, on Pointless Celebrities in 2018.</p>
      <p>Chris Simmons, who played DC Mickey Webb and memorably portrayed a heartbreaking male rape storyline during his time on The Bill, is currently in Hollyoaks as evil far-right gang leader Stuart Sumner.</p>
      <p>With that storyline set to come to a head shortly, something tells us Stuart won't be around the Chester village much longer...</p>
      <p>Scott Maslen, who played DS Phil Hunter, is now in EastEnders as Jack Branning - who has recently returned to the police force himself. We smell a crossover idea...</p>
      <h3>5. Who doesn't love a man in uniform?!</h3>
      <p>Let's face it, a man - or woman - in uniform is pretty hot!</p>
      <p>And given Sun Hill had some of the best-looking officers over the years, we wouldn't say no to watching them don their blue uniforms once again!</p>
