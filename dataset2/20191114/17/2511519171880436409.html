      <h2>Everything you need to know about the Euro 2020 draw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:08:32+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Critchley</a></address>
      <p>England are hoping to secure passage to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> finals this week in their final qualifying games against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate’s side only require a point to book their place at next summer’s tournament, which will be held in various nations across the continent.</p>
      <p>Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland also harbour hopes of automatic qualification but have significantly more work to do in their respective groups.</p>
      <p>Scotland cannot directly qualify but are assured of a place in the revamped 16-nation play-offs, which are scheduled to be held in March.</p>
      <p>The tournament will be played in 12 host cities and stadiums, including London’s Wembley, Glasgow’s Hampden Park and Dublin’s Aviva Stadium. </p>
      <h3>When is the draw?</h3>
      <p>The group stage draw will take place in Bucharest on Saturday 30 November at 5pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>Who has qualified?</h3>
      <p>Belgium, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain and Ukraine have already qualified for next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <h3>How does the seeding work?</h3>
      <p>Seeding is based on each national side’s performances in qualifying. </p>
      <p>The six best-performing group winners will be top seeds, the remaining group winners and best runners-up will be in Pot 2.</p>
      <p>The next best group runners-up will be in Pot 3, while the remaining runners-up and the play-off winners will be placed in Pot 4.</p>
      <h3>Will England be seeded?</h3>
      <p>As it stands before the final round of qualifying games, England are likely to be one of the six top-seeds.</p>
      <p>If England win their final two games against Montenegro and Kosovo, they will be guaranteed to land among the top seeds.</p>
      <h3>How does the hosting work?</h3>
      <p>Euro 2020 will be the first championships to be hosted by multiple countries – 12 in total, including England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>‘Host nations’ are not guaranteed to qualify for the tournament, but those who do will play at least two group stage games in their own country.</p>
      <p>Each host has been paired with another and allocated to one of the six groups. This is the group they will compete in, if they qualify. </p>
      <p>England and Scotland have been paired together in Group D, while the Republic of Ireland are paired with Spain in Group E.</p>
      <p>Whichever team has the superior qualifying record will play all three of their matches at home, including their head-to-head with the other host nation. </p>
      <p>For example, if England qualify automatically and Scotland qualify through the play-offs, England vs Scotland in Group D will be played at Wembley.</p>
      <h3>What stadiums are being used?</h3>
      <p><b>Group A: </b>Stadio Olimpico (Rome) and Olympic Stadium (Baku)</p>
      <p><b>Group B: </b>Parken Stadium (Copenhagen) and Krestovsky Stadium (St Petersburg)</p>
      <p><b>Group C: </b>Johan Cruyff Arena (Amsterdam) and Arena Nationala (Bucharest)</p>
      <p><b>Group D: </b>Wembley (London) and Hampden Park (Glasgow)</p>
      <p><b>Group E: </b>San Mames (Bilbao) and the Aviva Stadium (Dublin)</p>
      <p><b>Group F: </b>Puskas Arena (Budapest) and the Allianz Arena (Munich)</p>
      <h3>When are the play-offs?</h3>
      <p>For the first time, 16 teams will compete for the remaining four places at the finals in a revamped play-off system.</p>
      <p>The draw for the play-offs will take place on 22 November in Nyon, with the 16 nations split into four paths based on Nations League performances.</p>
      <p>Eight semi-finals will be played on 26 March, with four finals following on 31 March to determine the play-off winners.</p>
      <p>This means that the identity of the four play-off winners will not be known at the time of the finals draw on 30 November.</p>
      <p>Four of the six Euro 2020 groups will therefore contain an unknown ‘play-off winner’.</p>
