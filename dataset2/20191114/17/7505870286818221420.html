      <h1>4 months of Amazon Music Unlimited for $0.99 is the best deal in streaming</h1>

      <p>Look: if you’re being honest with yourself, all of the popular music streaming services out there are pretty much the same. You picked one at some point, for whatever reason, and now you feel some sort of allegiance to it so you’ve convinced yourself that it’s better than all the other ones out there. You’re wrong. It’s not. They all offer access to millions and millions of high-quality songs, and they all have apps that work on every major platform. Don’t believe me? Well, now it’s time for you to find out. Amazon just kicked off its crazy Black Friday sale on Amazon Music Unlimited, giving new subscribers a chance to get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited?tag=b0c55-20">4 months of the service for just $0.99</a>. You read that right… 4 months for less than one dollar!</p>
