      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Celine Dion says performing on her new tour is an "addicting" experience.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old Canadian singer discussed<i> </i>her <i>Courage</i> world tour and her new involvement in the creative process <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/1194978036476723201">during Thursday's episode</a> of <i>CBS This Morning</i>.</p>
      <p>Dion kicked off <i>Courage</i>, her first tour in 10 years, in September. She told host Gayle King that the shows have given her a new energy and excitement onstage.</p>
      <p>"The adrenaline is like a drug. So that's why I keep doing it," she said. "It's addicting."</p>
      <p>Dion said it's been great to connect with fans, whom King noted are "younger, older, male, female, black, white."</p>
      <p>"I'm so proud. I look at those kids and they're, like, 17 years old. And then I turn around, and those people are 60 years old. And then I'm like, 'Wow.' What's happening in my career?'" Dion said. "That is the greatest gift."</p>
      <p>"They look at me, like I said, beyond the songs," she added. "'Celine, are you okay? We got you, girl. We're here. we love you so much.'"</p>
      <p><i>Courage </i>takes its name from Dion's new album, scheduled for release Friday, and her single of the same name. Dion said she's found a new interest in production since her husband and manager René Angélil died in January 2016.</p>
      <p>"I've been so much involved, not only in my album but into the production of this show," she said. "I say what I like, I have ideas. They can be tacky, wrong. I'm not asking to be right. I'm just asking to be heard."</p>
      <p>Dion released a music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN-ZHOHmvcw">video</a> for "Courage" on Wednesday. <i>Courage </i>also includes the single "Imperfections," which Dion <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/09/26/Celine-Dion-goes-makeup-free-in-Imperfections-music-video/2151569504466/">released a music video</a> for in September. She said on <i>Today</i> in September that <i>Courage</i> <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/09/18/Celine-Dion-says-Courage-album-represents-losing-my-husband/1711568810563/">represents losing Angelil</a>.</p>
