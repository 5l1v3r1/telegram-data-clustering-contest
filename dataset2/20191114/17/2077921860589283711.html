      <h1>Here's Where You Can See Jonathan Glazer's Surprise New Short Film The Fall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:32:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Russell  </a></address>
      <p><i>Under the Skin</i> auteur Jonathan Glazer is currently in the midst of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/jonathan-glazer-under-the-skin-new-movie.html">prepping his next feature</a> for A24, an untitled Holocaust drama he plans to shoot in 2020—but first, Glazer has a surprise short film titled <i>The Fall</i> making its U.S. premiere this very weekend, playing only in theaters ahead of A24’s <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/09/the-lighthouse-review.html">The Lighthouse</a></i> in select cities.</p>

      <p>If BBC Films and A24’s teaser art for <i>The Fall</i> (not to mention the GIF above), shared Thursday evening alongside the short’s announcement, is any indication whatsoever, then we are in for a majorly unsettling experience. The film previously made a surprise debut in the U.K. in late October, with <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/10/jonathan-glazer-directed-short-the-fall-surprise-premiere-bbc-two-uk-cinemas-1202768961/">Deadline</a></i> reporting that the short is “inspired by <i>The Sleep Of Reason Produces Monsters</i>, an etching by Francisco Goya [...] and runs at 06:54.” (The etching itself, which you can see <a href="https://bit.ly/2O8IxVe">here</a>, is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.)</p>
      <p><i>The Lighthouse</i>, the latest film from <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-witch.html">The Witch</a></i> writer-director Robert Eggers, happens to be one of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/11/the-10-best-movies-in-theaters-right-now.html"><i>Paste</i>’s favorite films currently in theaters</a>. But in case you needed another reason to see it, a surprise short from the mind behind <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/11/best-movies-2010s-decade.html">one of the best films of the decade</a> is about as compelling as it gets.</p>
      <p>Sneak a peek at <i>The Fall</i>’s uncropped teaser art and the full list of locations where you can see the short below.</p>
