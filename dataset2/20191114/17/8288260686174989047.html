      <h1>'Coming to Birmingham has been one of my best life choices' - meet the Romanian apprentice making a new life in the city</h1>
      <h2>Raluca Munteanu moved to Birmingham four years ago and is now progressing in her new career with historic city manufacturer RH Nuttall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:50:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author">Tamlyn Jones, https://www.facebook.com/tamlynjonesbpm/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Raluca Munteanu is a 23-year-old apprentice with historic Birmingham manufacturer RH Nuttall.</p>
      <p>The company, which was established in 1860, is still run by two generations of the founding family and specialises in the production of non-metallic washers, gaskets and sealing strips.</p>
      <p>It even supplied all of the washers for the Tower of London poppy installation in 2014.</p>
      <p>Raluca left her native Romanian in 2015 to study psychology with criminology at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-university">Birmingham City University</a> (BCU), graduating last year with a 2:1.</p>
      <p>She has been working for RH Nuttall since April and is part-way through an apprenticeship programme which has already seen her promoted and handed greater responsibilities in the accounts side of the company.</p>
      <p>Raluca was the 500th apprentice recruited through the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ladder-for-greater-birmingham">Ladder for Greater Birmingham apprenticeship campaign</a> which is aiming to create 1,000 new apprenticeships in Birmingham and Solihull <b>(see factbox below for more information).</b></p>
      <h3>What has been your work experience so far?</h3>
      <p>I am an apprentice working in the accounts department and studying a business administration level 3 course through West Bromwich-based employment agency The Apprenticeship Works.</p>
      <p>Most of my work experience was gained during my time at BCU where I worked for the international and European department and admin office.</p>
      <p>I was a guidance adviser helping new students adapt to their university life and I also collaborated with the SU and international and EU department to create activities and workshops for the new students.</p>
      <p>I also worked with the recruitment and enrolment department, helping them understand students' needs and international students on what to expect from their courses.</p>
      <h3>Why did you decide to leave your homeland to come to Birmingham?</h3>
      <p>During my third year of high school, I decided I wanted a career that would relate to psychology and I thought coming to the UK would give me a better chance of achieving this goal.</p>
      <p>Coming here and studying at BCU has been one of my best life choices.</p>
      <p>The experience here has exceeded my initial expectations and the knowledge I have accumulated so far has built a path towards my goals.</p>

      <h3>What have been your duties during your apprenticeship?</h3>
      <p>I started off doing simple admin duties like filing, answering the telephone and keeping our systems up to date with information from suppliers and customers.</p>
      <p>I asked if there were other duties I could be taught so progressed onto the customer ledger - chasing debtors, sending statements, taking payments and investigating queries.</p>
      <p>It gave me an understanding of how to maintain relationships with customers from which I learned more about purchase ledger.</p>
      <p>I have now moved from the customer side to supplier side and have become one of the main points of contact for them.</p>
      <p>I was taught how to process and post purchase invoices and how to keep a clean ledger, making everything easier for my manager, and trying to solve any queries.</p>
      <h3>How does being an apprentice help you?</h3>
      <p>The things I learn and the situations I am faced with are showing me how an actual business environment presents itself.</p>
      <p>I now understand what it is like to work for a company and how important communication is between departments.</p>
      <p>Also, I cannot emphasize how important the relationship is that you build with a company's clients and suppliers, without which your job would be much harder.</p>
      <p>It is easier to sort out queries when everyone understands where each person is coming from and aims to solve issues on good terms.</p>
      <p>I feel I have progressed well while being an apprentice and have picked things up quickly and been able to take on more responsibilities.</p>
      <h3>What are your goals now?</h3>
      <p>I would like to continue building up even more good relations with our suppliers and continue progressing on my course.</p>
      <p>I aim to finish this before July and be hired in a proper account assistant position.</p>
      <p>I would like to steadily advance and built up my work experience and continue to learn new things that enhance my knowledge.</p>
