      <p>“What is going on right now is nothing sort of disgraceful. There is a full scale attempt going on out there as I speak to stop men and women freely putting themselves up before the UK electorate. You would have thought this was Venezuela,” Farage said.</p>
      <p>Brexit Party candidates “are coming under relentless phone calls, emails and abuse and being told them must stand down. That is happening in 21st Century Britain,” Farage said.</p>
