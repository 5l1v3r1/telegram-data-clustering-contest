      <p>BAYVILLE, Nassau County (WABC) -- Officials in one Long Island town are investigating two deadly fires in three days.</p>
      <p>In the most recent incident, fire tore through the home on Bayville Avenue in Bayville, and officials discovered a person and two dogs dead inside.</p>
      <p>It happened around 2 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Investigators scoured the scene for hours, working with the fire marshal and homicide detectives to determine the unidentified person's cause of death.</p>
      <p>The home is now boarded up.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, about a mile away, 94-year-old Sonia Baron was killed in a house fire on Bayville Park Avenue.</p>
      <p>A man was outside the home yelling for crews to help his wheelchair bound wife, but it was too late.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Fire officials are still trying to determine the cause of both fires, and the medical examiner is still working to identify the body found Wednesday.</p>
