      <h1>‘Wolfenstein: Youngblood’ Receives Massive Endgame Update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:45:39+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p><b><i>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</i></b> received <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4eK0AO4VGIii0kBWOnUmVx/wolfenstein-youngblood-update-1-0-7">a new update</a> that kicks off with a new endgame mission where players are given two brand-new areas — a Parisian reservoir and a secret Nazi bunker—in search of “Da’at Yichud Artifacts.” Once that’s been polished off, you’ll be treated to 20 new Treasure Maps that will be added to the game’s Missions tab. Each of the Treasure Maps lead to artifacts that will reward players with experience, silver coins, and ability points.</p>
      <p>Those extra ability points are a good idea, since the update also includes 11 new abilities, as well as a pair of new Pep Signals to throw: One that restores heavy weapon ammo, and another that grants quad damage across the board for four seconds. To counteract all of these goodies, players will be faced with three new enemies: The Wurmlochsoldat (an Übersoldier with a teleporting ability), the Electrodrohne (Tesla Drone) and the Turmhund (a Laserhund with a turret). Topping things off are a bunch of new skins for multiplayer.</p>
      <p>Bethesda also saw to it that the tune played in the video below also made it to YouTube. <i>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</i> is out now on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with a Switch port coming soon.</p>
