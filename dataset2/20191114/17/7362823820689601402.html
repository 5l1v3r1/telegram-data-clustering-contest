      <p>Orelia Hollins, who works at a CVS near the Southern Methodist University campus, was injured last weekend when an armed robber entered the store and opened fire. Hollins, who was eight months pregnant at the time, underwent emergency surgery to deliver her son.</p>
      <p>Hollins, 29, and her child remain hospitalized, but both are showing signs of improvement, Fox 4 reports. As of Monday, they were considered in “critical but stable condition,” The Dallas Morning News <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/11/02/pregnant-cvs-employee-shot-during-robbery-at-store-near-smu-police-say/">reported. </a></p>
      <p>She is now able to walk with assistance while her baby is “moving both arms and legs” and is “squirming around,” per <a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/pregnant-employee-shot-during-robbery-at-university-park-cvs-is-improving-along-with-her-baby">Fox 4. </a></p>
