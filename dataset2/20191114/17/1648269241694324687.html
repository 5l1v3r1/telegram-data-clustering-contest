      <h1>Sedans Will Rise Again GM Design Boss Says</h1>
      <h2>It’s all about style.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:02:31+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p>Over the last few years, both automakers and consumers have flocked to crossovers, SUVs, and trucks, leaving <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/sedan/">sedan</a> sales to wither. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a> discontinued the Taurus, Focus, and Fiesta. The Chevy Cruze got the ax, too. But don’t expect sedans to disappear entirely. <a href="http://gmauthority.com/blog/2019/11/gm-design-chief-believes-industry-will-shift-back-to-sedans/"><i>GM Authority</i></a> caught another tidbit between <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/gm/">GM</a> design chief Michael Simcoe and Dan Sandberg, Brembo North America’s President and CEO, on Brembo’s podcast, where Simcoe says the industry will cycle back to sedans eventually. </p>
      <p>However, Simcoe added, that at the end of the day, people want well-styled vehicles “their neighbors admire.” And that’s true. Right now, rugged SUV styling is proliferating throughout the industry as automakers continue to introduce new crossover and SUV models.  </p>

        <h4>The Sedan's Future Is Complicated:</h4>

      <p>Some data suggests sedan owners aren’t all jumping on the high-riding bandwagon either. A new study says <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/382371/cruze-focus-owners-switching-brands/">42 percent of Focus and Cruze owners did not upgrade to a crossover or SUV</a>. Instead, they went to another automaker for a car – <a href="https://www.motor1.com/honda/civic/">Honda Civic</a> and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a> are strong candidates. Both are among the 10 best-selling models in the U.S.  </p>
      <p>While there’s been a lot written about the viability of the sedan’s future, they still account for a significant portion of new car sales today. So far this year, consumers have bought 4.5 million sedans in the U.S. That’s not a small number, and there’s more than one automaker that’d like those sales.  </p>
      <p>But Simcoe is right. The debate isn’t so much about sedans versus SUVs as it is about people wanting well-styled vehicles. Right now, SUVs and crossovers are the hot-ticket items. In five or 10 years, we could be swimming in a sea of sedans and hatchbacks. Only time will tell.</p>
