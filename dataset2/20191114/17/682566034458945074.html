      <p>Cape Town - <b>Leicester City</b> are reportedly ready to send <b>Kelechi Iheanacho</b> out on loan for the second half of the campaign to give him some much-needed playing time.</p>
      <p>Nigeria international Iheanacho arrived at the King Power Stadium from Manchester City in August 2017 for a deal worth a reported £25 million and there was big excitement surrounding the move after his positive performances for the Citizens.</p>
      <p>However, the 23-year-old forward has struggled to displace former England striker Jamie Vardy in the starting XI and the Imo-born star has yet to play a single second of Premier League football this season.</p>
      <p>With Vardy scoring 11 goals from 12 top-flight games this term, it would be difficult for any player to take his place and Iheanacho has been forced to wait for his chances in the EFL Cup, where he has netted twice in as many matches.</p>
      <p>Although Brendan Rodgers stated earlier this month the Nigerian had a future with the Foxes, there is a growing sense the out-of-favour forward will be moved on at some point in the future.</p>
      <p>Leicester continue to be linked with a move for Metz star Habibou Diallo and there are strong claims the Foxes, who are sitting second in the Premier League, will make an offer for him in January.</p>
      <p>Rangers’ Colombian forward Alfredo Morelos is also believed to be a target for Rodgers, who is eager to beef up his attacking options and provide more competition for Vardy.</p>
      <p>Those potential new arrivals would push Iheanacho further down the pecking order at the King Power and it is claimed the 2015/16 English champions will send him out on loan for the second half of the campaign in January.</p>
      <p>Leicester, who are on a five-game winning run in all competitions, return to action on November 23 when they make the trip to the AMEX Stadium to take on Brighton, who lost 3-1 at Manchester United before the international break.</p>
      <p>The Foxes are unbeaten in the last four meetings with the Seagulls, while this fixture ended 1-1 last season.</p>
