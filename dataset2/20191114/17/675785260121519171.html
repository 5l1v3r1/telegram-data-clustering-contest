      <h1>Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Liverpool? Jurgen Klopp responds to question on signing ex-Man Utd star</h1>
      <h2>The Swedish striker is expected to return to Europe after bringing his time in America to an end, and Klopp has made his stance clear on a potential transfer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:19:06+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>It would be quite something to see <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> make a shock return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Even more so if he were to line-up for the current league leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> under Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old veteran has been linked with a move back to Europe after finally <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/zlatan-ibrahimovic-confirms-la-galaxy-20877409">announcing his expected departure</a> from LA Galaxy on Wednesday in typical fashion.</p>
      <p>"I came, I saw, I conquered. Thank you <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/losangelesgalaxy">LA Galaxy</a> for making me feel alive again," he said.</p>
      <p>"To the Galaxy fans – you wanted Zlatan, I gave you Zlatan. You are welcome. The story continues … now go back to watch baseball.”</p>
      <p>Speculation has linked him with a move back to Italy, with AC Milan suggested front-runners for his signature, while Ibrahimovic teased a transfer to Spain last month.</p>
      <p>But despite Ibrahimovic's impressive goals tally in the States, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> has made it clear that there is one reason why he won't be signing the Swedish striker .</p>
      <p>“If he had not played for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> before, then we might have considered him," Klopp <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/if-he-hadnt-played-for-man-utd-maybe-klopp-laughs-off/1ufsp6sdwz6fl11sxdgymmi1k0">told Sportbladet</a> . "But I'm not even sure he wanted to play here. We're a pretty intense team…"</p>

      <p>Ibrahimovic had a decent spell at Old Trafford, winning three trophies including the League Cup, where he scored the winner in the final against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>His move to the Red Devils was seemingly his last European stop in a journeyman-like career, before heading to the MLS where he netted 30 times in 29 appearances.</p>

      <p>But despite not being keen on a move for the Swede, wherever he ends up, Klopp had a clear message for him.</p>
      <p>"With that said, I couldn't have had more respect for Zlatan," Klopp added.</p>
      <p>“I love his whole career, love his efforts, love his confidence. While it may not always be right, it is entertaining anyway.</p>
      <p>“He's a fantastic character and I really hope he doesn't stop playing football. The world will miss him too much.”</p>
