      <h1>Upgrading messaging on Android in the U.S. with RCS</h1>

      <p>Our <a href="https://messages.google.com/">Messages</a> app brings you a seamless and helpful messaging experience on Android, from connecting you on mobile and <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/messages/five-new-features-try-messages/">desktop</a>, giving you suggestions from the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/messages/access-assistant-messages-plus-latest-rcs/">Google Assistant</a>, and making it easy to <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/messages/five-new-features-try-messages/easy-way-search-through-past-conversations-messages/">search</a> your conversations.</p>
      <p>To make your conversations more seamless, we’ve worked on upgrading traditional SMS text messaging with more useful chat features, powered by RCS (Rich Communication Services). When you and your friends message each other with these chat features, you can chat over Wi-Fi or mobile data, send and receive high-resolution photos and videos, and see if people have received your latest messages. Plus, you’ll get better group chats, with the ability to name groups, add and remove people to and from groups, and see if people haven’t seen the latest messages. </p>
      <p>Chat features are already available for some of you in Messages, and today we’re starting to broadly roll them out in the U.S. If you already have Messages, you’ll also be prompted to <a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714#chat_status">enable chat features</a> in the coming weeks. If you don’t have <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging&amp;hl=en_US">Messages</a>, you can download it on the Play Store. We expect this service to be broadly available in the U.S. by the end of year.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, we enabled the ability for anyone in the UK, France, and Mexico to get chat features in Messages and we’ll continue to work on bringing this to everyone on Messages around the world. We’re also committed to working with our partners, including carriers and device makers, to provide a consistent and interoperable experience for everyone on Android.</p>
