      <p>Lisa Armstrong suggested she was a "victim of a narcissist" amid her legal struggle to settle her £62million divorce with Ant McPartlin.</p>
      <p>The make-up artist, 43, and the presenter, also 43, are trying to reach a settlement on their divorce.</p>
      <p>As the bitter divorce rumbles on, the Strictly personality liked a venom-laden tweet about narcissism and the victims who are accused of being "crazy mentally ill delusional".</p>
      <p>Lisa liked a tweet which read: "A narcissist is always going to paint their victim as "crazy" mentally ill "delusional" imagining the abuse "psycho" emotional.</p>

      <p>"In fact, these are the top 3 projectory words that every narcissist uses A victim of a narcissist however never refers to a narcissist this way."</p>
      <p>The Mirror have approached Lisa Armstrong's representatives for further comment.</p>
      <p>Time is moving on as Ant has jetted out to Australia to host I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here after his year hiatus from his TV duties.</p>
      <p>It was claimed the comedian was hopeful to have settled his divorce before he made his trip Down Under.</p>

      <p>As Ant returns to our screens, it's said Lisa is back home in the UK dealing with their respective lawyers as costs mount to a whopping £1.5million in legal letters.</p>
      <p>At the crux of their complaint is Lisa's unwillingness to sign a non-disclosure agreement - as Ant is said to be desperate to avoid a public washing of his laundry in open court.</p>
      <p>Lisa, however, is relishing the opportunity to finish her marriage in the High Court, and is telling pals she will never sign the gagging order designed to protect Ant's reputation from further damage, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>Lisa and Ant were married from 2006 until they decided to announce their separation in 2018.</p>
      <p>The couple were happy together for 23 years while they were only married for 12 of those years.</p>
