      <h3>Grab Google’s GSM unlocked Pixel 3 XL on sale</h3>
      <p>Woot currently offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/google-pixel-3-xl-woot/">Google Pixel 3 XL 64GB GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone in Not Pink for <b>$440</b></a>. Usually selling for upwards of $599 direct from Google, right now you’ll find it sitting at the Amazon low of $535. Today’s offer is good for upwards of a 26% discount and matches our previous mention for one of the best direct cash discounts yet. While it may not be the latest from Google these days, Pixel 3 XL is still a compelling handset. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 845 Octa-Core CPU and features a 6.3-inch 1440p display, 4GB of RAM, and more. You can dive into our <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/10/15/google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl-review/">hands-on review</a> for an in-depth look.</p>
      <h3>Nokia’s new 7.2 includes a SIM card kit at $329</h3>
      <p>B&amp;H currently offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/13/nokia-7-2-128gb-smartphone/">Nokia 7.2 128GB Android Smartphone bundled with a Mint Mobile 3-Month SIM Card Kit for <b>$330</b></a>. Usually selling for $349 at Amazon, today’s offer is the first discount we’ve seen so far and good for an overall 20% savings when you consider the $60 value of the SIM kit.</p>
      <p>Nokia’s new 7.2 Android smartphone features a 6.3-inch HD+ display with HDR10 support, as well as a three-camera setup comprised of 48MP quad-pixel, a 5MP depth sensing, and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor. This handset runs Android Pie out of the box, but Nokia also promises you’re looking at two or more years of software updates. Check out <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/11/nokia-7-2-review/">our hands-on review</a> for more.</p>
      <h3>Just $56 snags Tenda’s 2-node 802.11.ac Mesh Wi-Fi System</h3>
      <p>Amazon is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/13/tenda-mesh-wi-fi-amazon/">Tenda 2-node 802.11ac Mesh Wi-Fi System (MW3) for <b>$56</b></a>. That’s 20% off the typical rate there and is within a buck or two of the lowest price we have tracked. This mesh network solution delivers up to 1200Mbps performance alongside coverage that can span 3,000-square feet. Everything can be managed using the Tenda app, which is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenda-wifi/id931811111">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tenda.router.app&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>
      <h3>Acer’s premium 15-inch Chromebook is $299</h3>
      <p>Walmart is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/aluminum-chromebook-acer/">Acer Chromebook 715 15.6-inch Touchscreen 2.2GHz/4GB/128GB for <b>$299</b></a>. That’s $80 off the typical rate there and is the lowest we’ve seen it go. With many Chromebooks sporting a cheap chassis, Acer’s 715 ratchets things up with an all-aluminum exterior. This delivers a MacBook-esque look and feel while clocking in at a fraction of the cost. Another notable feature includes 128GB of storage, which is significantly more than the 32GB or 64GB sizes that we often see. Up to 12-hour battery life can be achieved on a single charge, leaving you with all-day performance. Inputs include 2x USB-C, 3.5mm, microSD, and USB-A.</p>
      <h3>Ring Video Doorbell Pro deters porch pirates at $129</h3>

Unique to this model is dual-band Wi-Fi support, which you won’t find on the lower-end Ring offerings. There’s also enhanced motion detection, so you’ll always be notified when there’s activity outside. Includes a one-year warranty direct from Amazon.</p>
