      <p><b>LONDON — </b>Sonny Bill Williams said he could not turn down the opportunity to join Super League new boys Toronto Wolfpack in a deal reportedly worth over £5 million ($6.4 million) to the former All Black.</p>
      <p>Williams will return to rugby league for a third time in his career after ending his rugby union career with New Zealand by winning a bronze medal in the recent World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>The two-year deal will reportedly see the dual-code international become the highest-paid rugby player in either union or league.</p>
      <p>"Once this opportunity come about, it was an opportunity I couldn't turn down," said the 34-year-old as he faced the media in London.</p>
      <p>Williams had a lengthy meeting in Japan with Toronto head coach Brian McDermott after New Zealand's defeat to England in the semifinals where he was convinced to sign up to the Wolfpack project.</p>
      <p>"My manager was speaking to these guys around that (World Cup) time, but for me I said I don't want to hear anything about it because I wouldn't have done myself or the New Zealand jersey any justice in thinking about that," he added. "But as soon as the England game finished, it was the next day I caught up with my manager and he filled me in and what a blessed opportunity it is."</p>
      <p>Toronto -- backed by the Australian oil tycoon David Argyle -- have risen up the leagues since entering England's rugby league pyramid in 2017.</p>
      <p>In October they beat Featherstone Rovers 24-6 in the Million Pound Game to reach the Super League, which will see top-level rugby league played in North America for the first time.</p>
      <p>"What they're trying to achieve on and off the field is something special and instead of looking at the challenge and thinking what if I fail, it's 'what if we succeed and I am part of that?'" said Williams.</p>
      <p>"North America, if that door opens? The opportunities for young players coming through would be amazing for themselves and their families and to say I am a part of that would be something special."</p>
      <p>The Wolfpack begin their Super League season at home to Castleford on February 2.</p>
