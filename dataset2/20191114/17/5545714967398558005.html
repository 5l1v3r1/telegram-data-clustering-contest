      <p>After a string of duos, the Epic Games Store is back to giving out a single video game this week, but it's one worth nabbing. The next time you're in a classic <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> mood, you'll be glad <i>The Messenger</i> is only a few clicks away. The retro action-platformer is free on PC until Thursday, November 21.</p>

      <p>Aside from an eventual structural shift that can bog down the pacing, for better or worse, <i>The Messenger </i>is what it looks like: old-school precision platforming. It got the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-messenger-520344.phtml">Dtoid seal of approval</a>. I know some of you have been on the fence, so consider this an easy, relatively hassle-free in.</p>
      <p>Epic's next free game will be <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/bad-north/home"><i>Bad North</i></a>, an island-hopping Viking defense game.</p>

      <p><b>Disclosure-bot:</b> Just in case the editor neglected to mention it, we have zero control when deals start and end. Deals can sometimes be gone within minutes (please don't shoot the messenger). Trying deal links even hours after this article's time stamp may lead to self-punching, so maybe bookmark our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/index-huge.phtml?t=deals">video game deals</a> if you're on the hunt. Also, it goes without saying, but some shopping links do directly support the author. If you've spotted any inaccuracy please let us know asap.</p>
