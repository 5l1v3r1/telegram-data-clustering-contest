      <p>I’m curious about a lot of things regarding director <b>Matt Reeves</b>’<b><i> The Batman</i></b>, but one thing that a lot of fans are looking forward to seeing is what the costumes of the characters are going to look like. Especially the costume design for Batman.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen a lot of different designs for the Caped Crusader over the years, and now we have some rumored details to share with you regarding what we can expect to see from the Batman suit that <b>Robert Pattinson</b> will be wearing in <i>The Batman</i>.</p>
      <p>The first report comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_polito/status/1194337788826673152">Thomas Polito</a>, Geeks World Wide senior editor, who claims that the costume will be blue and gray and that a first look could be officially shared as soon as next month. The second report comes from another online scooper named <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/TheComixKid/status/1194339325372055552">KC Walsh</a> who says that we should expect "a modernized take on the [Adam] West costume, incorporating Blues and Greys, but no longer yellow." He then adds that "most importantly I’m told it will feature the white eyes."</p>
      <p>While this is just rumored info, it would be interesting to see a modernized take on Adam West’s costume! That actually sounds super intriguing. I guess we’ll find out if there is any truth to these rumors in the near future.</p>
      <p><i>The Batman</i> will be a noir style film that will lean into Batman as a detective. It’s scheduled to hit theaters June 25th, 2021. What do you think about the rumored design for Pattinson’s Batsuit?</p>
