      <p>Department spokesman Christopher Thomas says initial accounts of at least six victims Thursday morning may have been because of duplicate reports.</p>
      <p>Thomas says it's not known if the patients have gunshot wounds or other types of injuries. One is being flown to a hospital and two others are being transported by ambulance.</p>
      <p>Sheriff's deputies have swarmed the campus 30 milesÂ northwest of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
