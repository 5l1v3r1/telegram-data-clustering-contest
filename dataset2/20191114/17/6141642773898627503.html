      <p>Sheffield Wednesday have been charged with breaching EFL rules around financial fair play over the sale of Hillsborough.</p>
      <p>The EFL opened an investigation into the Championship club’s profitability and sustainability (P&amp;S) submission for 2017-18 earlier this year and has now issued “a number of charges” in relation to that investigation.</p>
      <p>“The EFL has reviewed a large number of documents obtained from the club as part of this process and concluded there is sufficient evidence to justify issuing charges of misconduct,” a statement from the league read.</p>

      <p>“The charges are in respect of a number of allegations regarding the process of how and when the stadium was sold and the inclusion of the profits in the 2017-18 accounts.”</p>
      <p>The EFL said the charges would now be considered by an independent disciplinary commission, with sanctions possibly including a points penalty.</p>
      <p>The club’s 2018-19 P&amp;S submission remains under review, the league said.</p>
      <p>Wednesday said in a statement: “Sheffield Wednesday note the statement issued by the EFL and the charges contained within.</p>
      <p>“These charges will be vigorously defended and the club will be making no further comment at this time.”</p>
