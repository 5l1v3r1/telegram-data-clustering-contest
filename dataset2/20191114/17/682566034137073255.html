      <p>Dsseldorf - Germany midfielder<b> Joshua Kimmich </b>said Thursday that he hopes the rumours are true that<b> Pep Guardiola</b> could be persuaded to once again coach the defending German league champions, Bayern Munich. </p>
      <p>Kimmich made his Bundesliga debut as a 20-year-old under Guardiola, after joining Bayern from then-second division side RB Leipzig in 2015, and says he would be pleased to see Manchester City's Spanish super coach return to coach the Bavarian giants.</p>
      <p>Germany's top-selling daily Bild claim Guardiola, along with Ajax's Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain's Thomas Tuchel, are on Bayern's list of candidates to replace Niko Kovac, who was sacked in early November.</p>
      <p>"I have a lot to thank him for," Kimmich, 24, said of Guardiola at a press conference with the German national team ahead of Saturday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Belarus.</p>
      <p>"He allowed me, as a player who only had second division experience, to play in the Champions League and Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>"We (Bayern) won the double (in 2013-14) and after that I became a national player, so of course I wouldn't complain."</p>
      <p>Kimmich is an established player for both club and country, captaining Germany in last month's 2-2 draw against Argentina in Dortmund when Manuel Neuer was rested.</p>
      <p>Guardiola, who has a City contract until July 2021, won the Bundesliga title in each of his three seasons as Bayern head coach from 2013-2016.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard started Kimmich off as a right-back at Bayern, then played him as a centre-back and a defensive midfielder, stating in 2016.</p>
      <p>"I love this boy. He can play anywhere," Guardiola said of Kimmich.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Hansi Flick, the assistant coach when Germany won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, has been appointed interim coach of Bayern.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how realistic that is or what Bayern Munich's plan looks like with Hansi Flick," Kimmich said of the Guardiola rumours.</p>
      <p>Kimmich revealed Bayern's stars are in the dark as to the identity of their next head coach.</p>
      <p>"First, we heard that a new coach was coming after the (January) winter break, now you hear it's going to either be in the winter or next summer. It's for the club to decide."</p>
      <p>Flick oversaw last week's 2-0 win over Olympiakos, which confirmed Bayern's place in the last 16 of the Champions League, and Saturday's 4-0 drubbing of Dortmund at the Allianz Arena which lifted the defending champions to third in the Bundesliga table.</p>
