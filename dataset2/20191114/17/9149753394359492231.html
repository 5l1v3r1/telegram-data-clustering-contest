      <p><b>Update: </b>Bleeding Edge now has a live <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189800/Bleeding_Edge/">Steam store page</a>, with a release date listed for March 24, 2020, and you can see the official trailer above.</p>
      <p>We're expecting to hear more about Bleeding Edge, the hero brawler in development by Ninja Theory, at XO19 tonight and tomorrow, but it appears a store listing for the game has revealed dates for the game's upcoming closed beta and launch ahead of the show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39681/bleeding-edge-release-date-closed-beta">True Achievements</a> spotted the Microsoft Store listing, which has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-eg/p/bleeding-edge/9ns9gt6fr6qc?irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2000142_aff_7794_1246483&amp;tduid=(ir__iz0i31vcpokfr2tbkk0sohz30m2xgo6sxbgcrkke00)(7794)(1246483)(%281b5c45ee8d1a0263e8b3ac1644017190%29%28266696%29%281503186%29%2887431X1540266X343c0d6bae3ed21536d6c1c03eb0bc8e%29%28%29)(1b5c45ee8d1a0263e8b3ac1644017190)&amp;irclickid=_iz0i31vcpokfr2tbkk0sohz30m2xgo6sxbgcrkke00&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab#">since been removed</a>. According to their reporting, Bleeding Edge will launch March 24, with two separate closed betas starting February 14 and March 13.</p>
      <p>The page also revealed that players who pre-order the game and Game Pass subscribers will have access to the beta phases.</p>
      <p>We first saw Bleeding Edge at E3 earlier this year, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bleeding-edge-is-a-chaotic-messy-hero-brawler-but-being-on-game-pass-could-help-it/">our panel had muted reactions</a> to their hands-on time with the game. It doesn't have the close-in, intense melee combat Ninja Theory has made itself known for, and appears to try to bridge the gap between Overwatch and MOBAs.</p>
      <p>However, our editors point out that the fact Bleeding Edge will be available on Game Pass will likely add a lot to its appeal.</p>
      <p>In any case, we'll find out more about it in the next two days at XO19.</p>
