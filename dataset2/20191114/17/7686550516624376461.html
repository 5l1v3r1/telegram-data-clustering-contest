      <h2>Player-run Pontllanfraith Rugby Club, in Blackwood, said it was devastated by the break-in</h2>

      <p>Charity boxes and till money were stolen from a rugby club after thieves cut a hole through a wooden door.</p>
      <p>Pontllanfraith Rugby Club, in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/blackwood">Blackwood</a> , were targeted by burglars in an overnight break in which also saw more than 10 bottles of spirits taken.</p>
      <p>Police have been notified of the theft, which is believed to have taken place between Sunday and Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time the rugby club has been broken into after a previous burglary took place in September.</p>
      <p>It has been a massive blow for the Division Three East C club, who rely on volunteers to keep going.</p>

      <p>Club vice-chairman Craig Coleman said: "(The thieves) affectively cut a big hole through in the fire door. They have smashed the till open and cut all the charity boxes open and taken money out of there.</p>
      <p>"There was a cash box which the boys were putting their fines in to put towards tour and they have physically ripped the safe from the wall.</p>
      <p>"We believe they have taken between £600 to £1,000 and 10 to 15 bottles of spirits."</p>

      <p>The club had been left without CCTV and an alarm system after they were both damaged in a previous break and were unable to afford a replacement.</p>
      <p>Craid added: "The club is 100% run by volunteers and we don't have any paid staff. Five years ago we were on the verge of having to close it but the committee, the players and the community worked together to keep it afloat.</p>
      <p>"To be honest something like this is discouraging, we have a lot of people donate their time and we have been able to refurbish the club.</p>

      <p>"Now we've had to fork out a couple of £1,000 to repair what's been damaged and to make it secure.</p>
      <p>"We have all got full time jobs but we have spent our evenings and weekends on the club and for someone to do this is pretty heartbreaking."</p>
      <p>The club will no longer be leaving cash on the premises and will no longer be putting charity boxes on the bar.</p>
      <p>"We're concerned this could happen again, these guys weren't kids because they came tooled up", said Craig.</p>
      <p>"We will no longer be an easy target."</p>
