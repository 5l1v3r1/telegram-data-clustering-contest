      <p>Marcus Rashford has pipped Dan James to the honour of being the fastest player at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> according to data collected by Opta.</p>
      <p>James arrived at the club in the summer from Swansea with the reputation of being one of the quickest players in the Championship, but according to the stats, as reported by <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-fastest-player-season-17258214">Manchester Evening News</a> , the fastest speed recorded by a United player so far this season was Rashford's 36.32km/h sprint against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in August.</p>
      <p>James is not far behind, with his top sprint coming in at 35.02km/h in the win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in September.</p>
      <p>The two players make up the top ten sprints recorded throughout the whole squad for the campaign, even though the likes of Anthony Martial, Aaron-Wan Bissaka and Paul Pogba can all switch on the afterburners when required.</p>

      <p>Rashford and James have certainly been two of the positive points in a mixed season at Old Trafford so far, with Rashford scoring nine and creating three assists in all competitions for United and James scoring three and assisting twice.</p>
      <p>Both players are currently away on international duty, but will most likely be in the starting lineup for United's game against Sheffield United on November 24 as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side look to build on their 3-1 win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>After the victory Solskjaer said: “That was our best performance of the season. It was an excellent performance from the lads. When you see them going forward, it's a joy to watch.</p>

      <p>“How it didn't end up five, six or seven, we don't know, but it was exhilarating and entertaining and great to see the boys enjoy themselves."</p>
