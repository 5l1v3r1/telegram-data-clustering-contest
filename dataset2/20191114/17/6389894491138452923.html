      <h1>Exclusive: Questions over Chilango's future after burrito chain calls in restructuring firm RSM</h1>

      <p>Mexican chain Chilango, best known for its “Burrito Bonds”, is in talks to secure its long-term future with restructuring firm RSM and is more than six weeks late posting its accounts.</p>
      <p><i>City A.M.</i> understands from a source familiar with the discussions that the firm is considering all options including administration or a company voluntary arrangement – a controversial restructuring agreement that allows restaurants to close outlets and cut rents.</p>
      <p>Chilango confirmed to <i>City A.M.</i> that it had engaged RSM “to assist on long-term planning, options and strategy” for the company. The firm declined to comment on what those options are.</p>
      <p>Accounts for Chilango – which runs 12 restaurants in London, Manchester and Birmingham – were due to be filed with Companies House by 30 September, but are marked as overdue online.</p>
      <p>A Chilango spokesperson said the company was “currently working” with its auditors to get the accounts “out as soon as possible”.</p>
      <p>It is understood the company is audited by Grant Thornton.</p>
      <p>The burrito chain has raised £5.8m from around 1,500 retail investors through two mini-bonds dubbed “Burrito Bonds” – controversial investment products that have come under scrutiny in recent months.</p>
      <p>Mini-bonds allow investors to essentially buy company debt for a set period in exchange for regular interest payments.</p>
      <p>They offer high interest rates, but are unsecured – meaning that if the company involved collapses, bondholders may not get any of their money back.</p>
      <p>The bonds also cannot be traded between third parties and are illiquid – because of this, they are considered risky investments.</p>
      <p>More than 700 investors backed Chilango’s first bond, which was raised in 2014.</p>
      <p>Its most recent bond – promising an eight per cent return for four years – closed in April last year. The offering was oversubcribed, and exceeded its initial £1m target to raise £3.7m from almost 800 retail investors.</p>
      <p>The minimum investment for the bond was £500 but 194 backers invested over £10,000, qualifying them for a free weekly burrito for the duration of the loan.</p>
      <p>Minibonds have lost their shine recently amid concerns investors do not understand the risks involved with the products following the collapse of mini-bond lender London Capital &amp; Finance (LCF) in January.</p>
      <p>LCF went into administration owing £236m to more than 11,000 investors. As issuing mini-bonds is not a regulated activity, most investors are not entitled to compensation.</p>
      <p>In April, the chair of the City watchdog said it would investigate “whether the existing regulatory system adequately protects retail purchasers of minibonds from unacceptable levels of harm”.</p>
