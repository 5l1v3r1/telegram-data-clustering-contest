      <h1>Exim Bank, Macrofertil, three others donate towards Farmers’ Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:50:20+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author">Eunice Hilda Ampomah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 14, GNA – In the quest to promote agriculture production in the country, the Exim Bank, Mohinani Group, BonAgro  Company Limited, Nsroma GPS, and  Macrofertil Ghana Limited, an Agriculture inputs-fertiliser company, have donated towards the 2019 Farmers’ Day celebration.</p>
      <p>The Exim Bank, donated a tractor with accessories, Nsroma GPS, a tracking for security company donated two vehicle tracking devices, while Macrofertil donated 100 cartons of Ervextra weedicide worth GH¢25,200.00 for rice and maize and a cheque for GH¢5,000.00.</p>
      <p>BonAgro Company Limited on the other hand donated 40 sprayers, and weedicides, while Mohinani Group, producers of polytank donated 1000 pieces of fruit packaging cartons, two bales of bagging sacks for farm produce, four pieces of 2,500 litre polytank, and black sheeting rolls for green house farming and drying of grains and vegetables.</p>
      <p>Mr William Obeng, the Head of Corporate Banking, Exim Bank, who presented the tractor, said the bank has a special focus on agriculture and agro processing, hence the interest to support the sector.</p>
      <p>He said the tractor would be given to the first runner-up best farmer, adding that, he believed the reward would motivate other farmers to rededicate themselves to the promotion of agriculture and food security.</p>
      <p>Mr Stephen Tour, the Head of Agriculture, Macrofertil Ghana Limited, said the weedicide donated by his company could be used on 2,400 acres of farm lands.</p>
      <p>It was the company’s core mandate to support the agricultural sector, since it focused on agriculture as an area of specialty.</p>
      <p>“It’s only good to show our appreciation to farmers by supporting them with these chemicals. We also ensure that we produce quality fertilisers, crop protection chemicals, vegetable feed, and animal feed to farmers to boost their production,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ms Elizabeth Owusu Kissi, the Group Corporate Affairs Manager, Mohinani Group, said the Group’s support was an annual gesture which forms part of its corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p>“We are a key supplier in the Agricultural value chain. So as part of efforts to thank farmers for contributing to the success of the company and encourage them to contribute to socio-economic development, we decided to donate these to them,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Gabriel Kwaku Sakyi Daniels, the Customer Success Manager, Nsroma GPS, said his company identified another area that was significant but often not realised in the agricultural value chain.</p>
      <p>Hence, the company donated the vehicle trackers, which allowed for a year of free subscription for farmers to track their operations and logistics to ensure their security and relevant usage.</p>
      <p>On the part of Bon Agro Company Limited, Mr Victor Nchonah, the Operations Manager, said the company has a core responsibility to appreciate farmers who are its key stakeholders.</p>
      <p>He said the company has also donated similar items to the regional levels to reward best farmers in the regions.</p>
      <p>Dr Gyeile Nurah, the Minister of State at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, expressed the gratitude of the farmers, government and the public to the companies for their benevolent gesture.</p>
      <p>He said the support would go a long way to encourage the farmers to exert more effort in agricultural production to boost economic growth.</p>
      <p>He entreated the donating companies to grace the occasion slated for December 6, this year at Ho, to witness the impact of their support in the lives of the farmers.</p>
      <p>“We believe in their various operations and success and we are hoping to have similar or more support next year from these generous organisations.”</p>
