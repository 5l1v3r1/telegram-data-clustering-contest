      <h1>Bayelsa: APC insists on participation, goes to Appeal Court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:13:45+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa says it remains in the race for the Nov.16 governorship election.</p>
      <p>The party insisted on Thursday that in spite of a Federal High Court judgment that nullified the party’s governorship primary of September 4, 2019, the party would participate.</p>
      <p>A Federal High Court presided over by Justice Jane Inyang had on Thursday nullified the nomination of Chief David Lyon as the candidate of the APC in a suit filed by Senator Heineken Lokpobiri , one of the aspirants that sought the ticket of APC.</p>
      <p>Inyang held that the primary election conducted by the APC violated the party’s rules and constitution and therefore a nullity in the eyes of the law and restrained INEC from recognising any of the aspirants that participated in the exercise.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the judgment, Jothan Amos, Chairman of Bayelsa chapter of APC, said that the party was optimistic of overcoming the setback before Saturday’s poll.</p>
      <p>He said that the party had set in motion the legal process of appeal and was in the process of obtaining a stay of execution pending the determination of the appeal.</p>
      <p>He assured party followers that the party was seeking judicial review of the judgment and urged them to remain calm.</p>
      <p>A Federal High Court in Abuja had on Tuesday disqualified the Deputy Governorship candidate of APC for the Bayelsa governorshipIelection Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, from participating in the forthcoming election.</p>
      <p>The court disqualified the Deputy Governorship candidate on the grounds that he provided conflicting information on the documents he presented to INEC, but APC has filed an appeal.</p>
