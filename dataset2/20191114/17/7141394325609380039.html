      <p>Crypto traders are tracking a recent transfer of 99,999,900 XRP worth about $27.4 million.</p>
      <p>According to Whale Alert, the transaction happened between two wallets of unknown origin. The XRP explorer Bithomp <a href="https://bithomp.com/explorer/E3EE77DAE273E7992C2E18952D53B2F4E64670A5FFBEC8C9EEEF670F3D8D3CE0">says</a> the transfer cost less than a penny.</p>

      <p>Although the receiving address was not identified by Whale Alert, a crypto analyst known as Light Crypto tells his 19,000 followers the XRP in question may have been transferred to a known market maker.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s because the wallet that received the XRP has sent dozens of transactions to an address created and owned by a Singapore-based crypto trading platform called Triple Dice Exchange, according to <a href="https://bithomp.com/explorer/rBTkSC7aJGVenCWeJWhwKNqa8hK2Fzsm6i">Bithomp</a>.</p>

      <p>Although a number of giant Bitcoin whales <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/half-a-billion-dollars-in-bitcoin-on-the-move-as-leading-crypto-consolidates">surfaced</a> on Wednesday, large holders of XRP have been relatively quiet.</p>
      <p>A recent analysis of crypto sentiment from DailyFX IG <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/11/02/xrp-investors-holding-on-tight-as-data-reveals-devotion-to-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-litecoin-ltc-and-fiat-currency/">found</a> more than 96% of XRP traders are long â€“ a higher number than Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.</p>
