      <p>Kennedy Mweene has applauded his fellow goalkeeper Cyril Chibwe for opting to play for his father’s country instead of Bafana Bafana. </p>
      <p>Chibwe, who plays for Polokwane City, had caught the eye of the South African national team coach Molefi Ntseki and was invited for last month’s Nelson Mandela Challenge against Mali in Port Elizbeth, but rejected it.</p>

      <p>He chose to represent Zambia instead.</p>
      <p>“I think for me it’s a personal choice. I know he was born here with Zambian parents, it’s the same thing I will face with my kids because they were born here,” said Mweene, the Mamelodi Sundowns goal minder who has been Chipolopolo’s first choice for several years now, though he admitted his time with them might be up.</p>
      <p>“In Zambia we are struggling with goalkeepers because there we are not spoiled like South Africa. I am also getting older and I need to give the young guys a chance. It will be good to have him there and already he has played a couple of friendly matches. It’s not a bad decision, especially because there are not a lot of goalkeepers outside SA.”</p>
      <p>Mweene said he has already warned Chibwe of the pressure that comes with having to give his best for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations title winners.</p>
      <p>“I have spoken to him about playing for Chipolopolo – mentally he was must be strong. There are a lot of things that happen. He did not grow up there, but slowly he is learning how it is and the pressure that comes with it,” he said.</p>
