      <p>Hero drug-busters on-board Royal Navy Type 23 frigate HMS Montrose have lifted the lid on a cheeky Arabian Sea gang's doomed attempts at hiding £800,000 worth of highly potent Class A drugs.</p>
      <p>The Gulf-based Plymouth vessel sprung into action to snare sea pirates carting a massive haul of heroin and crystal meth last month.</p>
      <p>The naval crew - made up of sailors and marines - seized a whopping 170kg of narcotics from a fishing boat in a daring raid.</p>
      <p>Now the boarding party who led the tense operation have revealed how the culprits staged a fake engine breakdown in their attempts to lie about their expensive drug pile - destined for UK shores.</p>
      <p>Little did the gang know, the navy had interpreters on board who knew exactly what was going on.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/defence/gulf-drug-smugglers-faked-engine-breakdown-to-try-and-hide-800k-heroin-haul-from-royal-navy-1-9140156">The News</a>, Leading Engineering Technician Ricky Waterhouse, who was second in command on the day of the maritime siege, said: "They were very misleading. We had interpreters on board and they were saying to them; "oh, that's it now, you've caught us."</p>
      <p>It didn't take long Montrose to find the drugs - stashed away in the steering gear.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"They faked a breakdown hoping that we would leave that compartment," LET Ricky said.</p>
      <p>"But we knew it was a bit iffy that while we were searching the steering gear compartment, there was a steering gear breakdown.</p>
      <p>"So that's when we chose to go on with the search and found a large amount of narcotics."</p>
      <h3>Royal Navy HMS Montrose - and her 'mighty' Gulf mission</h3>
      <p>Mighty Montrose - the fifth of the frigate fleet - was acting in her role for the multinational Combined Task Force 150 - part of a wider Combined Maritime Forces group of 33 nations responsible for counter terrorism and counter narcotics out in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.</p>

      <h3>How the Arabian Sea drug raid unfolded</h3>

        <figcaption>Success - HMS Montrose managed to recover the drugs - worth £800,000</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The suspicious dhow Arabian lateen-rigged ship was first clocked by a chopper from French frigate FS Jean Bart.</p>
      <p>The French, suspecting something was up, sent a boarding party to secure the vessel.</p>
      <p>They were then relieved by Plymouth-based HMS Montrose who led a search of the boat.</p>
      <p>The sailors spent hours combing every nook and cranny for a whiff of illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>They initially came up trumps having found small stashes in bulkheads around a cooker.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't until eagle-eyed sailors and marines began scouting the steering gear compartment did they uncover their biggest haul - two-thirds of the entire drugs pile.</p>
      <p>LET Waterhouse, who normally by day maintain's HMS Montrose's gas turbine engines, said: "We laid it all out on our flight deck.</p>
      <p>"We were surprised at how much they could hide in such a small place.</p>
      <p>"It was scary really. They had a lot bigger spaces they could have hidden it in, but they chose not to."</p>
      <p>Montrose is somewhat of a specialist when it comes to complex sea ops.</p>
      <p>Back in July, she was forced to position herself between three Iranian vessels and British Heritage - a commercial vessel <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/royal-navys-hms-montrose-intercepts-3078767">which the foreign pact was blocking as it attempted to travel through the Strait of Hormuz.</a></p>
      <p>Montrose issued verbal warnings to the stubborn Iranian vessels, which then turned away.</p>
      <p>As reported by Plymouth Live, the altercation came a day after Iran spoke out against Britain due to the interception of a supertanker believed to be breaching EU sanctions by carrying a shipment of crude oil to Syria.</p>
