      <p>Ford's first dedicated electric vehicle will be known as the<b> Mustang Mach-E</b>.</p>
      <p>Although it uses the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/mustang/">Mustang</a> name, the EV crossover is expected to share few physical attributes with the coupe and convertible except for badging and some styling cues, such as the tail-lights.</p>
      <p>In terms of concrete details about the car, Ford has so far revealed it will have a range of <b>595 kilometres</b> using the WLTP test cycle.</p>

      <p>From <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/806420/2020-ford-mach-e-spied/">spy photos</a>, we know the car will be a five-door crossover coupe with flush-fitting door handles and a closed grille area.</p>
      <p>We'll know more about the Mustang Mach-E soon, as the car will be unveiled in Los Angeles on November 17 at 6.30pm, local time.</p>
      <p>After the launch is over, Ford will begin taking reservations for the vehicle for buyers in the US and Europe. To secure a place in the production queue, prospective owners will need to put down a refundable US$500 ($730) deposit.</p>
      <p>The company will also have a similar reservation system in place for people in China, but details have yet to be confirmed.</p>

      <h3>Australia</h3>
