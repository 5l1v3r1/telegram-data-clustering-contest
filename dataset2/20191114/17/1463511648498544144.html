      <p>Antonio Canhandula, United Nations High Commission for Refugees Representative in Nigeria and ECOWAS, says there are 33,000 Cameroonian refugees in Cross River.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a courtesy visit to Cross State House of Assembly in Calabar on Thursday, the UNHCR representative said Cross River had about 70 per cent of Cameroonian refugees in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“As I speak, we have 46,000 refugees from Cameron currently in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Cross River has 33,000 out of this number and 70 per cent of refugees from Cameroon live in Cross River,” Canhandula said.</p>
      <p>He said that the UNHCR decided to move the refugee camps to Ogoja when it discovered that there were high concentration of refugees in the northern part of the state.</p>
      <p>According to him, the UNHCR is seeking collaboration with relevant sectors, including Ministries of Health, Education and Women Affairs, to tackle some of the challenges facing the refugees.</p>
      <p>The UNHCR representative commended the State Emergency Management Agency for providing land for the refugees to farm and earn a living.</p>
      <p>He said he was in the Assembly to seek partnership with the state legislature on the way forward.</p>
      <p>Canhandula thanked the state government for her support and solicited for increased assistance.</p>
      <p>Responding, the Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, Eteng Williams, thanked the UNHCR for the visit, adding that the house would partner with the UN body.</p>
      <p>“We are ready to partner with you. All you need to do is to always inform us of your plans,” he said.</p>
      <p>NAN recalls that leadership crises in the Republic of Cameroon had led to residents of Southern part of the country to flee to neighbouring Nigeria for safety. </p>
