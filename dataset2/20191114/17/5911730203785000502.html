      <p>POLK COUNTY, Fla. --- The Polk County Sheriff's Office is warning the public of utility company scams.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office said they have received a report of a telephone scammer posing as a utility company.</p>
      <p>The person who received the call did not fall for the scam and hung up on the caller.</p>
      <p>Usually in the scam, the victim will receive a call from someone claiming to be from a utility company. They say the victim is behind on a payment.</p>
      <p>They then tell the victim in order to prevent their electricity from being shut off, they will need to send the "company" money. Typically, the caller will ask for money cards or gift cards.</p>
      <p>“Scammers tend to be aggressive and pushy and act with a sense of urgency. Decent and legitimate companies don’t conduct business that way. Protect your money and your personal information; never give it up when you can’t be sure of who you’re talking to,” said Sheriff Grady Judd.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office is asking people to be careful of calls like this.</p>
