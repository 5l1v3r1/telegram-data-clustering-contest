      <h1>Disney+ Ahead of Projections With 10 Million Subscribers by End of Day One</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:00:00+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, after just one full day of Disney+ streaming availability, the House of Mouse came out with a press briefing that states the service has signed up 10 million subscribers and counting. This makes sense, as the company allowed pre-orders and bundling with Hulu and ESPN+, and they boast such an incredible library of classic and original content. Everyone I know has subscribed, so 10 million doesn’t surprise me in the least.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/disney-reports-10-million-sign-ups-for-disney-1202784944/">Deadline</a> reports:</p>
      <blockquote>At 10 million subscribers, Disney+ is already one of the most popular streaming services in North America and it puts Disney ahead of its own projections for 60 million to 90 million subscribers globally by 2024.</blockquote>
      <p>Disney stock is up 3% as well. The service is just too good for fans to pass up, and is promising so many impressive things still to come. So, as usual, it’s good to be Disney! Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Doug Creutz called it a “very strong start” and added:</p>
      <blockquote>“We expect pay conversion will be a high percentage of these initial sign-ups. The 10 million sign-ups took the affirmative action to opt in to the service on the very first day it was available. We continue to think the consumer decision to subscribe/not subscribe to Disney+, particularly for families, is pretty clear-cut with its compelling content price-point and strong brand recognition, and given Disney’s overwhelming marketing push for the product we continue to think the adoption curve is likely to be faster than any other OTT service to-date.”</blockquote>
