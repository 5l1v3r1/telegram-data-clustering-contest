      <h1>Brussels launches legal action against UK over failure to nominate commissioner</h1>
      <h2>The UK government argues it cannot make a significant international appointment in a run up to an election.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:41:14+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Hans von der Burchard, Eleni Courea</a></address>
      <p>The European Commission launched an infringement procedure against the U.K. on Thursday over its refusal to nominate a candidate for EU commissioner.</p>
      <p>"As the Guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its EU Treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of EU Commissioner," a Commission press release <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_19_6286">said</a>. "The U.K. authorities have until Friday 22 November at the latest to provide their views [on the launched procedure]. This short time period is justified by the fact that the next Commission must enter into office as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen and her team hope to take office on December 1 — a month behind schedule — but the U.K. has so far refused, despite two written requests by von der Leyen, to put forward a nominee for commissioner.</p>
      <p>Britain’s Ambassador to the EU Tim Barrow wrote to the Commission on Wednesday night <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-wont-nominate-eu-commissioner-before-election-ambassador-tells-brussels/">saying that Britain won't nominate a candidate</a> before the general election on December 12, despite having agreed to do so as part of a deal that postponed the Brexit deadline to January 31. Neither side has made the contents of the letter public.</p>
      <p>"We have written to the EU to confirm that pre-election guidance states the U.K. should not normally make nominations for international appointments during this period," said spokesperson for the U.K. government.</p>
      <p>"The Commission ... considers that the U.K. is in breach of its EU Treaty obligations," said the press statement, while rejecting the British argument that London cannot nominate a commissioner because of the period of election "purdah."</p>
      <p>"The European Commission recalls that, in accordance with established EU case-law, a Member State may not invoke provisions prevailing in its domestic legal system to justify failure to observe obligations arising under Union law," it said.</p>
      <p>The procedure against the U.K. could also serve the Commission as a necessary legal preparation to potentially proceed with the inauguration of the new Commission by December 1, even if the U.K. still has not nominated a Commissioner by then, an EU diplomat said.</p>
