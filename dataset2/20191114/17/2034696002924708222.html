        <b>Featuring the likes of a chess-playing Flea, a golfing Alice Cooper and a model train-loving Rod Stewart</b>
      </p>
      <p>When they’re not on stage, writing tunes or stuck in the recording booth, our favourite musicians are, essentially, just like the rest of us. Some like to knit, others like to breed dogs and a few even collect military vehicles and drive them around the block (OK, maybe they’re not <i>entirely</i> like the rest of us).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/rod-stewart-unveils-massive-model-railway-2567639">Following the grand reveal of Rod Stewart’s impressive, many years-in-the-making model railway set-up this week,</a> we thought we’d look back at some of the weird and wonderful hobbies that musicians have taken up over the years.</p>

        <figcaption><i>5</i> of 16<br/>Jack White – Upholsterer<br/>Before The White Stripes man hit the big-time, he was a simple upholsterer in his hometown of Detroit.

They're worth a fucking fortune now.<cite>Image credit: Getty</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption><i>10</i> of 16<br/>Alice Cooper – Golf<br/>“I know a lot of guys are quitting [music], but a lot of guys still smoke and drink. They’re probably tired," Cooper observed in 2018. "I’m not tired. People always say, ‘Well, you could just play golf every day,’ and I say, ‘I play golf every day anyway!'” His love for golf even led to the publication of a book, 'Golf Monster: A Rock ‘n’ Roller’s 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict', in 2007.<cite>Image credit: Getty</cite></figcaption>
