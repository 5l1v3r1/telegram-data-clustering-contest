      <p>Former Kaizer Chiefs striker Serge Djiehoua will be remembered more for his muscular thighs than for his goal scoring prowess. The Ivorian was largely referred to as the fittest player in the league.</p>
      <p>Djiehoua spent time at Chiefs between 2005 and 2007 where he scored five goals in 10 appearances for the Glamour Boys.</p>

      <p>Fans will remember the career-threatening injury the 36-year-old suffered at the hands of former Jomo Cosmos defender, Andrew ‘Jaws of Life’ Rabutla.</p>
      <p>He could have easily been mistaken for a nightclub bouncer, due to his muscular frame.</p>
      <p>Since leaving Chiefs in 2008, the striker has gone on to represent 13 different sides across obscure leagues in Europe, and currently plays for Turkish side, Sarayköyspor.</p>
