      <p>Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein took a swipe at Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, appearing to borrow President Trump's <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/warren-on-pocahontas-barbs-i-cant-stop-donald-trump">attack line</a> based on her claims of Native American heritage.</p>
      <p>"Vilification of people as a member of a group may be good for her campaign, not the country," the billionaire <a href="https://twitter.com/lloydblankfein/status/1195020090108006405">tweeted</a> Thursday in response to Warren singling him out in a campaign ad. "Maybe tribalism is just in her DNA."</p>

      <p>Warren's DNA became the topic of controversy last year, before her presidential election announcement, when she produced a DNA test that she said showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry.</p>
      <p>After receiving criticism over the move, though, Warren said earlier this year that she is "not a person of color."</p>
      <p>"I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference," she said.</p>
