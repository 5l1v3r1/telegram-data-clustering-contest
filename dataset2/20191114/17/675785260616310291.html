      <h2>Boris Johnson nearly gets run out of town after turning up with promises of £500 to pay for damage caused by overflowing rivers and backed-up sewers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:54:21+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Routledge, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/paul-routledge/</a></address>
      <p>“So, what are you going to put right today?” teased reader Richard as I left the Co-op with my Mirror.</p>
      <p>Good question, old lad. So let’s get on with it, before we all drown – in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>’s lies.</p>
      <p>Somebody showed him Yorkshire on the map, and he came up ’ere to talk his way out of trouble over the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/floods">floods</a>. He only waded in deeper.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was virtually chased out of town by angry voters furious over his lazy, weak, patronising incompetence.</p>
      <p>They had enough on their plate, without bumbling Boris “an annoying little man who didn’t even get his wellies wet” posing for the TV cameras in floods of crocodile tears.</p>
      <p>Congratulations to the victims of the near-biblical inundation of the lower Don Valley for calling power to account. They needed action earlier, and they didn’t get it. It took a week for ministers in Whitehall to shift gear from electioneering to the job they’re paid to do.</p>
      <p>And then it was too little, too late – £500 per household for families swamped by three feet of filthy river water.</p>
      <p>What do you want to replace: the fridge, or the living room carpet?</p>
      <p>That’s as far as rich Bozza’s generosity will go, and it isn’t just pathetic. It’s an insult from Tory politicians spraying billions of pounds on eye-catching, deceitful promises in a sordid bid to remain in power. The money they’ve spent on botched Brexit alone would have made the whole country flood-proof.</p>
      <p>They must think there are no votes in flood-hit Yorkshire, because these are all traditional Labour seats.</p>
      <p>A miscalculation. The eyes of the country have been on this tragedy for many days, and it isn’t over by a long chalk.</p>
      <p>Voters will remember how the Government let the people down. I can’t put this crisis right, Richard, but you can rely on me to bang on about it.</p>
