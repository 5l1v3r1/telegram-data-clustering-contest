      <h2>McCandlish Butchers in Greenhills Square closed at the weekend due to uncertainty over the future of the shopping centre - but is still operating from its Westwood shop.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:22:55+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>A popular butchers has shut up shop after more than 40 years with plans to transform the ailing Greenhills Square yet to get underway.</p>
      <p>McCandlish Butchers closed its doors on Saturday, moving operations and staff to their base in Westwood.</p>
      <p>The family business threatened to pull out of Greenhills last November with its lease coming to an end, fear over their long-term security, investment needed in the shop and dwindling footfall at Greenhills Square.</p>
      <p>But after striking a deal with the landlord they stayed put in the hope that latest plans to transform the centre would come to fruition.</p>
      <p>Local councillors have previously raised concerns over the viability of the centre going forward.</p>
      <p>Plans for part of the shopping centre were finally lodged with South Lanarkshire Council earlier this year - on behalf of a on behalf of a Mr Z Ahmed -  after a number of previous proposals from other parties failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>These have since been agreed under delegated powers by the council.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, this has come too late for owner Alex - whose dad (Alex snr) took over the Greenhills unit more than 40 years ago - saying the shop was no longer sustainable.</p>
      <p>"We have sat for a year waiting for something to happen, but we weren't any further forward," he told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride News.</a></p>
      <p>"It's a question of how long would we have to wait for anything to happen or work to begin? How can we run a business with so much uncertainty - it's just not possible to do that or plan ahead so, sadly, the only course of action left to us was to close the Greenhills shop for now."</p>
      <p>Alex said he can't thank customers in the area enough for their support over the years but many of them have now started to go to Westwood.</p>
      <p>He went on: "The good thing is we moved all our operations and staff over to Wetswood so no one has lost their jobs and customers have already started coming there.</p>
      <p>"But there is no doubt it was a sad day on Saturday closing the Greenhills shop. We have been there so long and were part of the community.</p>
      <p>"If and when Greenhills Square is refurbished we may look at returning, but we will just have to wait and see how things pan out.</p>
      <p>"The shop needed money spent on it and no business can afford to invest significant amount of money if they have no guarantee they will still be there in a year or two's time."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> South Counncillor Fiona Dryburgh said: "It is a sad loss to Greenhills Shopping Centre to lose McCandlish Butchers.  It was beneficial for so many to have been able to buy locally and it will not be the same without them."</p>
      <p>Fellow Councillor Archie Buchanan said: "It's very sad that we have now lost McCandlish Butchers from the shopping centre, who was well respected and produced quality products for this community for many many years.</p>
      <p>"With the redevelopment of the centre we can only hope that a butcher takes one of the units to continue providing the services for this community."</p>
