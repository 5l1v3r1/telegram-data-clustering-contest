        <b>Death of the Daesh* Leader</b>
      </p>
      <p>The head of the terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was recently proclaimed dead after several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate him. He killed himself using a suicide vest after being attacked in his hideout and hunted down in a dead-end tunnel by US troops. They confirmed his identity by carrying out a DNA test, buried his remains at sea, and levelled his hideout.</p>
      <p>His death was later confirmed by several countries, including Iraq and Turkey, as well as Daesh*-affiliated media, which subsequently proclaimed that the group had chosen a new leader, reportedly called Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, also known as Abdullah Qardash. The alleged leader of the organisation was previously an officer in the Iraqi Armed Forces under late President Saddam Hussein.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump stated that the country knows the identity of the new Daesh* leader, while the State Department said that they are “looking into” him, including his origin and role in the terrorist group.</p>
