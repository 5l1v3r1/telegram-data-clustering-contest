      <h1>Fish oil may benefit patients with heart failure</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:57:36+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Norton, HealthDay News</a></address>
      <p>Fish oil might help people with heart failure avoid repeat trips to the hospital, a new study suggests.</p>
      <p>The findings come from an analysis of a clinical trial first published last year, where researchers tested the effects of fish oil and vitamin D on people's risk of heart disease and cancer.</p>
      <p>That main trial -- called the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) -- had some encouraging results. Healthy older adults given a fish oil supplement were less likely to suffer a heart attack over the next several years, especially if they had never been big fish eaters.</p>
      <p>The current analysis looked at whether supplements had any effect on participants' risk of being hospitalized for heart failure.</p>
      <p>Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart gradually loses its ability to efficiently pump blood to the body. Often, it stems from heart-muscle damage caused by a heart attack -- which raised the question of whether the benefits seen in the trial might extend to heart failure, explained Dr. Luc Djousse.</p>
      <p>Djousse, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, led the current study.</p>
      <p>Overall, his team found, neither vitamin D nor fish oil curbed the risk of first-time hospitalization for heart failure over five years. But people using fish oil were somewhat less likely to need repeat hospital stays.</p>
      <p>The finding offers a "signal" that the supplements might help prevent heart failure hospitalizations, Djousse said.</p>
      <p>But, he stressed, that still needs to be backed up by further study.</p>
      <p>Fish oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to help lower triglycerides, lessen inflammation and blood clotting, and help stabilize heart rhythm.</p>
      <p>The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that people eat fish twice a week -- preferably fatty varieties higher in omega-3, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and albacore tuna.</p>
      <p>Djousse advised following that recommendation. "But don't fry your fish," he added. "Have it broiled or baked."</p>
      <p>The findings, published Nov. 11 in Circulation, come from a trial involving nearly 26,000 adults aged 50 and older who were initially free of heart problems. They were randomly assigned to take either 1 gram of prescription-grade fish oil (Omacor), 2,000 IU of vitamin D, or a placebo every day.</p>
      <p>Over five years, the fish oil group was 28 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack compared to the placebo group. The effect was more pronounced among people whose diets had been low in fish: They were 40 percent less likely to have a heart attack than placebo users.</p>
      <p>When Djousse's team looked at heart failure hospitalizations, there was no clear effect of either fish oil or vitamin D on first-time admissions. But fish oil users were 14 percent less likely to have repeat hospitalizations: There were 326 recurrent hospital stays in that group and 379 in the placebo group.</p>
      <p>Why wouldn't fish oil prevent a first hospitalization? It's not clear. But Djousse said there were fewer first-time hospital stays, so the numbers might have been too small to detect an effect.</p>
      <p>That is a possibility, agreed Dr. David Siscovick, a senior research scientist with the New York Academy of Medicine who was not involved in the study.</p>
      <p>More research is needed, Siscovick said. But, he added, at this point, there is no evidence that fish oil can prevent heart failure from developing.</p>
      <p>There is, however, evidence that patients with existing heart failure may benefit.</p>
      <p>Siscovick chaired an AHA committee that, in 2017, issued an advisory on omega-3 supplements and heart disease.</p>
      <p>The advisory said it was "reasonable" for doctors to prescribe omega-3 to heart failure patients, based on an Italian clinical trial called GISSI. In that trial, researchers randomly assigned heart failure patients to either take an omega-3 supplement or a placebo (olive oil). Over four years, patients on omega-3 had a 9 percent lower risk of being hospitalized or dying.</p>
      <p>The current study, Siscovick said, is "very consistent" with that evidence.</p>
      <p>He also stressed, though, that heart failure is a complex condition, with different forms and different underlying causes. So if people with heart failure are curious about fish oil, he said, they should talk to their doctor about whether a prescription is right for them.</p>
