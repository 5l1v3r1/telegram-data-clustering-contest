      <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s executive launched a legal case on Thursday against Britain for failing to name a representative for the new European Commission that is due to take over from Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>“The European Commission has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its EU Treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of EU Commissioner,” the Commission said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It gave London until Nov. 22 to respond.</p>
      <p>A British government spokesperson later told Reuters: “We have written to the EU to confirm that pre-election guidance states the UK should not normally make nominations for international appointments during this period.”</p>
