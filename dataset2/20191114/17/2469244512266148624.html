      <p>A loaded trainee solicitor from Exeter swaps her pampered lifestyle and parents' mega-mansion for life with a debt-ridden family of five in Lincoln on tonight's Rich Kids Go Skint on 5Star (9pm).</p>
      <p>For Devon, from Devon, money is not a concern. She receives a £500 monthly allowance from her parents, who also pay her bills - and they bail her out if she is ever short of cash.</p>
      <p>Not only does she spend a lot on designer items, from Gucci and Louis Vuitton bags to £800 on a designer coat, but she also pays out £100 a week on takeaways.</p>
      <p>She lives in a mansion the size of three small houses which has an incredible 12 bathrooms - three of which are just for her.</p>

      <p>So she receives a shock when she goes to stay with the Gibbins family.</p>
      <p>Paul and Sammie have three young kids and survive on a combined salary and benefits of £1,730 a month.</p>
      <p>After bills, childcare and food, they have a little over £50 for the rest of the month.</p>
      <p>They are also in £3,000 worth of debt.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, their first impressions of each are quite different.</p>
      <p>After commenting on the fact the area does not have a Waitrose on her way to the Gibbins household, Devon said: "It looks a bit rough, quite run down, there's a lot of rubbish on the floor, the houses look quite small.</p>

        <figcaption>She has to learn how to shop on a budget<cite>(Image: 5Star)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I guess I am a little bit out of my comfort house."</p>
      <p>Sammie is stunned when she learns how much Devon spends on herself.</p>
      <p>Paul earns £1.100, while Sammie receives £630 of benefits. After paying £535 on rent, their utility bills and food shops, the couple is left with roughly £50.</p>
      <p>All the while, they are trying to clear their substantial debt pile.</p>
      <p>"If we had Devon's allowance we could be out of debt in four months," said Sammie, who was training to be a nurse but had to drop out to look after her kids.</p>
      <p>"It upsets me a little bit to think she doesn't have to think about what she spends on clothes or her hair or her beauty.</p>
      <p>"We could save for a new house, our life could be dramatically changed, which is scary to think."</p>

      <p>Still, they manage to forge a strong understanding over the course of the programme.</p>
      <p>Devon helps fix a bathroom door and goes hunting for clothes and gifts in a charity shop - impressing Sammie after picking out three presents for £7.46.</p>
      <p>"When I saw how much the family had to budget it was quite eye-opening," Devon said.</p>
      <p>"I don't have to think about how much I have left for the week. It's very hard what they have to do."</p>
      <p>To help out, Devon offers to babysit for a night - although this pushes her to her limits as the kids argue for much of the evening.</p>

        <figcaption>Devon is sad to leave the Gibbins family after their stay together</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But by the end of the programme, she was sad to say goodbye to the Gibbins family, who she said were all 'so nice'.</p>
      <p>"I loved the time I spent with the family," she said.</p>
      <p>"I think I'll take away the fact that I am very lucky, and I need to appreciate that a bit more and realise that not everyone is lucky enough to live the way I live.</p>
      <p>"It's kinda sad to leave the family, they're all so nice. It was really opening to see how other people live."</p>
