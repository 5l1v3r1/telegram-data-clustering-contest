      <h1>NBC News thinks impeachment hearing lacks "pizzazz", but what if it just lacks Pazuzu?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-14T17:43:39+00:00">14 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>NBC News, as many people as loudly saying, can "<a href="https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/1194841529036222464">go fuck itself</a>" for publishing an item that claims the impeachment hearings <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pizzazz-trends-nbc-news-impeachment-inquiry-hearings-boring-1471735">lack the "pizzazz" necessary to make news</a>. But what if NBC reporter Jonathan Allen was not in fact a towering smarmy moron but had simply made a typographical error? Because when you think about it, is it not true that the impeachment hearings could do with more Pazuzu, the Mesopotamian demon king of the southwestern wind, the bearer of storms?</p>
