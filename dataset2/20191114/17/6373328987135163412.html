      <h1>Disney+ Putting Disclaimer For Racism In Popular Old Movies</h1>

        <b>Disney+ is protecting itself against complaints by putting a disclaimer for racism in some of its old movies. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The new streaming service arrived earlier this month packed to the brim with some classic Disney shows as well as new, original content.</p>
      <p>One of the draws of Disney+ is the fact it’s home to <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/disneys-new-streaming-app-will-have-every-film-theyve-ever-made/">every single film the company has ever made</a>, giving Disney fans their favourite childhood movies from years gone by on demand.</p>

      <p>Though many films have been getting a new lease of life with live-action remakes, some of the old animations remain fan favourites, including <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> (1995), <i>The Jungle Book</i> (1967), <i>Peter Pan</i> (1953) and <i>Dumbo</i> (1941).</p>
      <p>However, a number of these films include blatantly problematic racist elements – though the company clearly deemed them acceptable at the time.</p>
      <p>In <i>Dumbo</i>, for example, a character named Jim Crow speaks with an accent which is a racist parody of a black American accent. Similarly, both<i> The Aristocats</i> and <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> feature Siamese cats which speak in voices that are offensive parodies of East Asian accents. All of these characters were voiced by white actors.</p>

      <p><i>Peter Pan</i> includes racist depictions of Native Americans.</p>
      <p>As society has become more aware, the references are recognised as being unacceptable and as such Disney has decided to include a disclaimer in the descriptions for some of their older films.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It reads:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>Popular titles like <i>The Aristocats, Fantasia, Dumbo, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp </i>and <i>The Jungle Book</i> all have this disclaimer in an attempt to address the issues.</p>
      <p>A number of Disney+ users have praised the use of the disclaimer on Twitter, with some commending the company for holding themselves accountable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One viewer tweeted:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Look at #DisneyPlus letting the people know early that their old films were racist and culturally insensitive.<br/><br/>Accountability is key, and historical context is important.</blockquote>

      </figure>
      <p>However, others have accused Disney of trying to ‘gloss over’ the fact they share racist content by referring to them as ‘outdated’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>One frustrated user wrote:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>i think it’s the fact that disney is trying to gloss over the fact that some of the sh*t is flat out racist by calling them ‘outdated cultural depictions’ like the crows from the original dumbo movie were pretty much racist black caricatures.</blockquote>

      <p>Though the disclaimer has been met with controversy, it is a necessary warning if the company plan to continue streaming their old films.</p>
