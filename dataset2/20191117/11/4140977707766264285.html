          </p>
          <p>During a Group D match of the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019-20 between Mumbai and Assam at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai opening batsman Prithvi Shaw made a comeback into competitive cricket after five months.</p>
          <p>Shaw was handed an <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/prithvi-shaw-suspended-indian-batsman-handed-back-dated-suspension-for-doping-violation/">eight-month suspension</a> after a banned substance was found in his urine sample during the last season of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Having commenced his Test career with a ‘<a href="https://thesportsrush.com/prithvi-shaw-on-his-maiden-test-century-its-all-for-my-dad/">Man of the Series</a>‘ performance against West Indies at home last year, Shaw injured his ankle during a pre-series warm-up match in Australia to be eventually <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/prithvi-shaw-to-miss-the-first-test-vs-australia/">ruled out of the series</a>.</p>

                <p>While the aforementioned series of events has seen the 20-year old player losing his Test spot, he seems to have made a point with his sixth T20 half-century in a winning effort against Assam today. After Assam captain Abu Nechim put the hosts in to bat, Shaw and wicket-keeper batsman Aditya Tare stitched a 138-run opening partnership which powered Mumbai to 206/5 in 20 overs.</p>
                <p>While Tare top-scored for his team with 82 (48) with the help of 12 fours and a six, Shaw played well for his 63 (39) which included six fours and two sixes. After crossing the 50-run mark, Shaw was seen emulating India captain Virat Kohli’s ‘<a href="https://thesportsrush.com/watch-virat-kohlis-celebration-after-scoring-25th-test-century/">bat doing the talking</a>‘ celebration.</p>

                      <p>A below par batting performance saw Assam only managing to score 123/8 in 20 overs. All-rounder Riyan Parag, who registered bowling figures of 4-0-30-3 in the first innings, top-scored for Assam with 38 (33) including two fours and sixes each.</p>
                      <p>With bowling figures of 4-0-15-2, spinner Shams Mulani was the best bowler for Mumbai. Having won six out of seven matches till now, Mumbai are the table-toppers in their group.</p>
