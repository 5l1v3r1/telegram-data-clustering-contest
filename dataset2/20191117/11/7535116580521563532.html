      <p>The Northeast Monsoon season is hitting Malaysia and we are showered by rain almost every single day.</p>
      <p>The residents in the coastal areas of Kota Bharu, Kelantan are preparing for the waves that will hit their homes. According to <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/16/residents-build-wave-breaker-to-face-high-tide">The Star</a>, the high tide phenomenon is expected to occur in one of these days, and the residents are worried about the condition of the existing concrete wave breaker.</p>
      <p>Due to coastal erosion, <b>the waves had eaten up the coastal land and the initial 2km-distance from a resident’s home to the beach shortened to only a few metres</b>. The Drainage and Irrigation Department did build a concrete wave breaker “to prevent heavy erosion in the area”, but it definitely did not solve the erosion that ate up almost 2km of land.</p>

      <p>To take this matter into their own hands, the residents of Kampung Pantai Kundur DIY-ed their very own wave breaker — with gunny sacks. About a hundred gunny sacks that contained sand were stacked in the back of a resident’s house. The 58-year-old resident mentioned that her family had begun stacking these gunny sacks since last month and that the monsoon season would cause uneasiness among the residents in that kampung.</p>
      <blockquote>“My family will be on high alert at all times and feeling anxious because we are constantly worried about any untoward incident that can occur.”</blockquote>

      <p>Seeing how their land has eroded over time, <b>the residents are worried that big waves will be able to surpass the concrete wave breaker soon</b>. They also hoped that relevant parties would increase the height of the concrete wave breaker.</p>
      <p>We hope that the residents will be safe during the monsoon season and that the authorities will take proper action to protect the people and their houses.</p>
