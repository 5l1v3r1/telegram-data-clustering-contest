      <h2>James Michael's trip of a lifetime turned into a nightmare when the parasite burrowed into his privates while he as swimming in a lake.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:32:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Wright</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/holidays">British traveller</a> spent three months in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/hospitals">hospital</a> and lost the use of his legs after taking a dip in a lake - when a parasitic worm swam up his penis.</p>
      <p>James Michael, 32, went swimming in Lake Malawi in southeastern Africa with pals two years ago, but had no idea and had no idea a parasitic worm had burrowed into his privates.</p>
      <p>The parasitic worm laid eggs inside him, which slowly made him so ill his immune system went into overdrive, and attacked his spine.</p>
      <p>The marketer was hospitalised for three months while medics fought to get the infection - bilharzia - under control, giving him only a 30 per cent chance of a full recovery.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>But after a stint in a wheelchair, suffering digestion and toilet problems, and using crutches for four months he has finally made a full recovery.</p>
      <p>James, from London, said: "When I look back at photos from my time in Africa, it's weird to think that's where the parasite crawled up my penis.</p>
      <p>"That wasn't exactly how I imagined the trip of a lifetime with my friends going - the whole experience was surreal and strange.</p>
      <p>"Plotting a line, it was like going straight from a paradise beach to a hospital bed, almost incapacitated and helpless.</p>

      <p>"This journey has made me definitely think more about my health and about how I look after myself - like reading up on health risks when I travel.</p>
      <p>"I would urge anyone thinking of getting into Lake Malawi not to.</p>
      <p>"It's just not worth the potential risks of a little worm climbing in your body through your parts. It's a grotesque, sickening thought.</p>
      <p>"This has been horrendous. It's felt like a never-ending mountain I've had to climb."</p>
      <p>James went on the "trip of a lifetime" to Africa with three mates back in August 2017.</p>

      <p>They travelled from Zambia to Zimbabwe, before visiting Malawi for five days.</p>
      <p>The group of three swam and canoed for three hours a day every day in Lake Malawi - before jetting back to the UK.</p>
      <p>"Even though I contracted the infection then, nothing happened and I was able to leave for home thinking nothing was wrong," he said.</p>
      <p>In October 2018 James began to notice a loss of feeling in both his legs, and initially thought it was fatigue from cycling.</p>
      <p>"I supposed it was just from the exercise, so didn't worry about it," he said.</p>
      <p>"But the feeling of fatigue never shifted, and actually got worse that month."</p>

      <p>But it got worse over the course of a few weeks, until it was taking him five minutes to climb up 15 steps to his flat.</p>
      <p>He went to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in November 2018 when he woke up sweating uncontrollably, and started to worry he had MS or motor neurone disease.</p>
      <p>Worried James was given antibiotics and sent home, but still felt terrible, and a week later, with the loss of feeling increasing went back to hospital.</p>
      <p>"I explained to them that something serious was going on," he said.</p>
      <p>"I went to the neurology department, and they did blood tests to see what was up.</p>
      <p>"They determined quite quickly that my immune system was attacking my spine, leading to the loss of control of my legs.</p>
      <p>"I was put on a six-month <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/drugs">course of steroid</a> s to counter this, but they didn't actually know what had caused this."</p>
      <p>Tests revealed his immune system was attacking his spine, and he eventually totally lost the use of his legs due to a combination of pain and loss of feeling.</p>
      <p>Doctors from the Hospital For Tropical Diseases told panicked James that a parasitic worm had crawled up his penis and laid eggs in his body.</p>
      <p>A week before Christmas he was diagnosed with bilharzia - an infection caused by a parasitic worm which lives in fresh water in subtropical and tropical regions - and given suitable medication.</p>
      <p>He said: "That killed the infection but I was left basically debilitated.</p>
      <p>"They told me there was a 30 per cent chance I'd make a full recovery - ten years from now.</p>
      <p>"It was a horrible feeling - I felt completely helpless, and the odds weren't good. I couldn't wish what I've been through on anybody."</p>
      <p>He had to spend three months in hospital using a wheelchair, then four months on crutches, until April.</p>
      <p>He also had to deal with extreme acne caused by steroids, diarrhoea, and using a catheter because he couldn't use the loo.</p>
      <p>James said: "The pain has been like nothing I've ever know. At times, it has been an excruciating physical pain that's been debilitating.</p>
      <p>"Early in my recovery - sometime in January - I had a really terrible acne outbreak that went all down my back and down my arms.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't sleep for a month because lying on my back hurt. I couldn't really be under running water either, so I had to shower my front instead.</p>
      <p>"The loss of feeling and use of my legs affected every part of my life. I wasn't able to exercise much because of the infection, which was hard.</p>
      <p>"In January, I couldn't use the toilet normally, so had to use a catheter. That was quite embarrassing for me because it's not something you associate with young guys.</p>
      <p>James also lost his appetite and struggled to maintain a sex life with his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>He said: "My girlfriend couldn't hug me because just to touch me hurt and we've not been intimate with each other because it's just too painful for me.</p>
      <p>"I'll certainly think twice before taking a dip in Lake Malawi."</p>
