      <h1>‘Party Whip’: UK Lib Dem Candidate Defends her Racy TV Ad Appearance in S&amp;M Gear as a ‘Joke’</h1>

        <b>Ahead of the UK snap poll, parties have been on the election trail up and down the country, adhering to their dominant campaign themes, with the Conservatives focused on getting Brexit done, Labour pledging to end austerity, the Liberal Democrats vowing to stop Brexit and Scottish nationalists aiming for another referendum on independence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Claire Malcomson, a last-minute candidate for the Lib Dems in the UK general elections, has stoked interest for previously featuring in an S&amp;M-style television ad, complete with a whip, suspenders and stockings.</p>

      <p>​Malcomson replaces Tim Walker in Canterbury, which is predominantly Conservative held, and is considered to be Kent's most marginal seat.</p>
      <p>The woman, who is a trained actress and part-time singer, appeared in a raunchy 30-second clip for a Belgian casino.</p>
      <p>In the clip, the prospective MP is shown dining at a restaurant with a fictional partner, as a flirty waitress slips the man her number, which he bins.</p>
      <p>The scene then cuts to the couple back at home.</p>
      <p>As the man gets ready for bed, Malcolmson's character enters the bedroom in an S&amp;M-style outfit with latex corset, elbow-length gloves and stockings with suspenders.</p>
      <p>She is shown cracking a whip against the bed as the pair exchange suggestive glances before the scene cuts to the casino's logo.<br/>Next, the pair are shown in bed looking dishevelled as they pore over a betting website.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the ad, which was part of a lighthearted television campaign from 2014, the single mother-of-four told <i>Kent Online</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>“There's nothing risqué about it. …If you can't do things like that...you're supposed to do them in a liberal society. It's meant to be a joke.”</blockquote>
      <p>The politician, who is currently a district councillor in Dorking, Surrey, adds:</p>
      <blockquote>“I think it's the way people look at things. I'm fully clothed — I've got tights on.”</blockquote>
      <p>The advert has featured on Malcomson's website, which also links to her political Twitter profile.</p>
      <p>As the footage hit social media, some were quick to berate the Lib Dem candidate:</p>

      <p>Others saw the humour of it as they wondered if, perhaps, the whip might be called for in her subsequent duties:</p>
