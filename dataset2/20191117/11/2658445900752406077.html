      <h3>By Gboyega Alaka</h3>
      <p>Kemi Olugbode, the General Manager of the Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency, LASCOPA, definitely had her hands full early last week, as she and her team hosted members of Ilefunfun community in Magbon Area of Badagry and officials of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC), led by its HOD, Customer Complaints and Maintenance, Mrs. Iyela.</p>
      <p>Members of Ilefunfun community through their leaders, had petitioned the agency over what they described as unjust treatment by the Eko Electricity Distribution Company, accusing it of over-billing, reneging on promise to supply them pre-paid meters and cutting off power supply to their community, thereby throwing them into perpetual darkness and untold hardship for weeks.</p>
      <p>Making their presentation through one of their chairman, Raufu Atolagbe, the community said Eko Distribution Company commissioned their transformer and started supplying them power in 2017. This followed their personal efforts of pulling together funds to install poles, which they said they backed with a letter stating that it was their donation to the electricity company.</p>
      <p>They however insisted on prepaid meters, which they said EKEDC supervising office in Agbara acceded to.</p>
      <p>Said Atolagbe, “We are a community of just about 116 houses, of which most are one-room, two-room buildings. Having agreed that they would provide us with pre-paid meters, the Eko Electricity management overseeing our community, then headed by Engineer Eze, said we must first collect and pay at least three bills. But four, five months after, they kept urging us to be patient, until June, when they brought this set of bills, which we considered outrageous.</p>
      <p>“Prior to that June, our average bills were between N2,500 to N3,000; but they came with N6,000, N6,000 plus, without corresponding increase in power supply. As a community, we went to make a complaints, and the new boss there, Mr Sunday Oyejide appeased us and told us to go and make payment on the bills, pending when the issues would be resolved. Meanwhile, they had also hinted us that they had about 600 pre-paid meters in stock and that our community would be among the first to be supplied once the process began.”</p>
      <p>Stating that the distribution company only supplied them light around 8th and 9th of every month, when they want to distribute bills, and just before they embark on their regular disconnection spree, Atolagbe said, the community made it clear it was better they came and disconnect the lights than continue with the new extortionist trend.</p>
      <p>However, following negotiations back and forth, and accusations and counter-accusations, in which Ilefunfun accused EKEDC of diverting the meters earlier promised them to other communities, Atolagbe said they were surprised to see EKEDC staff suddenly come and disconnect the power supply to the entire community from source. This, in spite of the fact that some residents had even made payment.</p>
      <p>“When we took them up on this, they accused us of tapping power and threatening them: two things that never happened, because – first, we are all responsible, law-abiding people, and secondly, there was no way we could have gone onto high tension cable to tap power.”</p>
      <p>Responding, leader of the EKEDC team, Mrs Iyela, appreciated the community for the donation of poles but noted that it was not their responsibility.</p>
      <p>She said bills are done according to power that goes into a community, especially when they do not have individual meters.</p>
      <p>“You may say that most of the houses in your community are one-room, two-room buildings, but appliances differ. It is only because there is no meter that we have this issue.”</p>
      <p>She also said it is not right for a community to pull bills together on whatever grounds and dump them in any DISCO office, noting that complaints on bills can only be done on individual basis, after which the organisation would, investigate and where necessary, do credit adjustment.</p>
      <p>She said the community was right about the earlier promise of meters but added “that that was when the DISCOs were doing Credit Metering Project, in which customers were issued meters and the cost is gradually deducted from their bills. Later, the government, on realising that it was not sustainable, introduced Meter Roll-out, which gave the distribution companies a five-year window to meter clients. I’m sure it was based on that roll-out plan that your community was promised but the truth is that DISCOs cannot continue the roll-out, hence government’s introduction of Meter Asset Providers, MAP, under which third party companies will provide the meters.”</p>
      <p>She however noted that this is a process that will take time, considering that EKEDC alone has more than 500,000 clients.</p>
      <p>Debunking the idea that meters designated for them may have been diverted, Iyela stated that there is no 600 meters stocked anywhere. She advised the community to go online: www.ededc.com, download the forms or fill online, submit, after which an assessment would be done and on payment, their meters will be supplied not later than ten days from day of payment.</p>
      <p>Iyela also promised that the MAP contractors would be in their community last Thursday, but information reaching The Nation, was that no contractor had until the time of going to press, visited.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Olugbode, while urging the Ilefunfun residents to adopt the online option, urged both parties to adopt conciliatory approach for more satisfactory resolution.</p>
