      <p>Pictures show thousands of men queuing for a free prostate cancer test in what organisers said was the ‘biggest such event in the world’.</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 men were tested for the disease, which is the most common killer of male cancer patients in the UK.</p>
      <p>Volunteers from the Reading Lions Club helped organise the event at the Rutherford Cancer Centre in Thames Valley, west London, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Men were offered free blood tests, known as the PSA test, which normally cost around £140.</p>
      <p>This checks for raised levels of a protein in the blood, which can indicate cancerous cells.</p>
      <p>Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer and 11,000 men die from the disease in the UK every year.</p>
      <p>Alan McMahon, 71, from Berkshire, said going to last year’s free testing event saved his life.</p>

      <p>He explained: ‘I had my blood test and when I received the Lions result letter, I was shocked to see that my PSA reading was abnormally high.</p>

      <p>‘I immediately contacted my GP and she referred me to a specialist urologist.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘After a month of radiotherapy I was placed on a three-monthly hormone injection programme and my PSA reading is now virtually zero.</p>
      <p>‘It is not an exaggeration to say that the Lions have saved my life as the cancer was caught just in time before it spread elsewhere.</p>
      <p>‘I cannot stress enough how important it is that all men over 50 be tested and therefore take advantage of this event at the Rutherford centre and book a test.’</p>
      <p>Chris Howes, 48, also found out he had prostate cancer after last year’s event, and is now cancer-free after successful treatment.</p>

      <p>Mr Howes, also from Berkshire, said: ‘I was extremely fortunate to come to this event and have a test which flagged up a potential problem.</p>
      <p>‘I was completely symptom-less, were it not for this test, my cancer would have been left undiagnosed.’</p>
      <p>Dr Christopher Blick, consultant urologist at the Rutherford Cancer Centre, said: ‘It is very important that men are aware of the risks of prostate cancer and when it is likely to occur.</p>
      <p>‘While in most cases it will occur in later life, it is still possible for men in their 50’s or even late 40’s to get prostate cancer.’</p>
