      <h1>Report: PSG consider swoop for Liverpool’s Adam Lallana</h1>
      <h2>Adam Lallana is out of contract next summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:15:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain want to sign Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197">according to The Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool could lose Lallana with PSG ready to open pre-contract negotiations in January. Lallana is out of contract in summer 2020 so PSG can sign him on a free transfer for next season.</p>
      <p>Lallana has been a bit-part player at Liverpool recently after a string of injuries. The England midfielder has also lost his place in the national team.</p>

      <p>However, PSG are ready to hand him a lifeline and offer him the chance to play in France. PSG are the reigning Ligue 1 champions and looked nailed on to win the league again.</p>
      <p>PSG want a new winger because Edinson Cavani is leaving. The Uruguayan is heading to the United States to join LA Galaxy as Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s replacement. So PSG want Lallana to fill the void Cavani will leave.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>This is a potentially bizarre transfer. PSG can offer Lallana the chance to win the league in France and compete in Champions League football so it will be a similar project to his current role as a Liverpool bit-part player.</p>
      <p>At this stage of his career, the 31-year-old needs to think about his playing time. After five years at Liverpool, it could be the time to move on and this is an exciting opportunity.</p>
