      <h1>Marian Shved defends Celtic switch and reveals why he hasn't had much game time</h1>
      <h2>The Ukraine star has played just 35 minutes under Neil Lennon but he isn't worried about where his career is going.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:12:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Walker</a></address>
      <p>Celtic winger <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/marian-shved">Marian Shved</a> insists he has no regrets about his move to Glasgow despite struggling for gametime.</p>
      <p>The Â£2million was signed last season by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> just before he quit to join Leicester City and was immediately loaned back to homeland club Karpaty Lviv before returning to Glasgow in the summer.</p>
      <p>But he's made just two sub appearances under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> totalling 35 minutes when he scored in a 2-0 Champions League qualifier win in Estonia against Nomme Kalju, but wasn't seen again until he appeared as a late sub in the 6-0 hammering of Ross County last month.</p>
      <p>However, his lack of appearances for the Hoops didn't prevent Andriy Shevchenko including him in his squad and he played for the last 20 minutes as a sub for Euro 2020-bound Ukraine in a friendly win against Estonia.</p>

      <p>But Shved insists he's satisfied in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>He said: "I am happy I moved to Scotland. It's a different style of football than what I have been used to back home.</p>
      <p>"I am working hard and learning so much.</p>
      <p>"The coaches and manager of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> have told me if I keep working hard I will soon start to get minutes on the pitch for them, but it hasn't happened yet.</p>
      <p>"It was great for me to get on the pitch against Ukraine and hopefully I will get some minutes for Celtic soon too."</p>
