      <p>An NDA convener should be appointed for better coordination among alliance partners, newly appointed Lok Jan Shakti party chief Chirag Paswan said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Paswan, speaking to reporters after an NDA meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament, said <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a>’s absence was felt at the meet as it was one of the oldest National Democratic Alliance member.</p>
      <p>“There should be better coordination among allies and an NDA convener should be appointed,” he said.</p>
      <p>It’s a matter of concern that the Telugu Desam Party left the alliance first and then the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party did.</p>
      <p>“But all of us (allies) will work together in the upcoming session and more such meetings should happen,” said Paswan, who was appointed the LJP chief earlier this month.</p>
