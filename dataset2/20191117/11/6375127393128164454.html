      <h3>MANILA Police District Director PB/Gen. Bernabe Balba ordered the arrest of an MPD cop after seeing a video of the latter hurting a 12-year-old boy who damaged the side mirror of his car in Pandacan, Manila. Said video went viral on social media.</h3>
      <p>Balba  said there will be no whitewash in the investigation, adding that once found guilty, the policeman, identified as PMSG Dennis Piad of the Manila District Traffic Enforcement  Unit and residing in Pandacan, may face dismissal from the service.                  </p>
      <p>It was learned that the incident happened last November 13 at around 1 p.m., when Piad saw that the boy had damaged his car’s side mirror.</p>
      <p>The cop reportedly hurled invectives at the boy and harmed him, until the victim’s mother arrived and stopped the cop and then brought her son to the hospital. The police report did not specify what the cop did to the boy.</p>
      <p>Police said the boy’s mother has signified her intention to charge the cop with violation of Republic Act 7610 or the anti- child abuse protection law.</p>
