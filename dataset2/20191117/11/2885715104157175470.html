      <p>Struggling to think about what to wear on your next brunch date or girl’s day out? Hoodies and sweatshirts can get boring and we understand. After all, winter fashion is underrated and you can always experiment with basic pieces and still kill it with style.</p>
      <p>With winter fashion, remember there are two main points to be always considered. Firstly, less is more and secondly, it’s all about how you layer. If you are someone who just doesn’t want to settle down for a basic hoodie and jeans look, long jackets will soon be your favourite.</p>
      <p>They are versatile, chic and classy. It lifts your outfits instantly and you can wear them with almost anything. From <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/deepika-padukone/">Deepika Padukone</a>’s brunch outfits to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/alia-bhatt/">Alia Bhatt</a>’s airport staples, scroll down to see how it’s become a much-loved piece for the A-listers.</p>

      <p>Your trench coat doesn’t have to be simple, it can be as electric as Deepika’s. In the above pic, she is wearing a coat from Off White which has geometric prints in black and white. This makes for a statement piece which can be colour-blocked or can be simply be worn as a single outfit with minimal jewellery. Here the <i>Tamasha </i>star wears it a yellow maxi dress and completes her look with strappy heels in the same colour and turquoise blue earrings.</p>

      <p>You want to put your best foot forward? Go for something as fierce as Priyanka’s long jacket in crimson red. It’s catchy and at the same time it is classy. You can colour block or you can go monochrome just like she does with her pantsuit underneath.</p>

      <p>If you like to keep it basic then do it like Bebo. A long jacket in beige goes a long way and you can easily go wearing it from day to night. For days filled with work, wear a basic beige long jacket with a striped shirt or a plain shirt with trousers and for a party at the night shift to an LBD (little black dress) with the coat for a chic look.</p>
