      <p>A man who crept into his victim’s home while she was asleep with the intention of sexually assaulting her has been jailed.</p>
      <p>Ian Essom, 41, got into the property in Olney, Buckinghamshire, at around 1am on 18 November last year and started kissing his sleeping victim.</p>
      <p>When she resisted his advances, Essom restrained her before eventually leaving the property.</p>
      <p>He was found guilty of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence after a one-day trial at Aylesbury Crown Court in May.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Essom was already subject to a two-year restraining order at the time for repeatedly staring at a 21-year-old woman as she worked late shifts at a petrol station.</p>
      <p>For that offence, he was found guilty of harassment and given a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, police said.</p>
