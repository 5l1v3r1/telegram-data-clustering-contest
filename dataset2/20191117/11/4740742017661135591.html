      <h1>What the Royal Family actually do all day - from the Queen to Kate Middleton</h1>
      <h2>They've got some *very* busy schedules</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Zahra Mulroy</a></address>
      <p>It may seem like being a royal is easy.</p>
      <p>A nice house, delicious food, travelling the world and being invited to glamorous events.</p>
      <p>But, if you're born in to the Royal Family, there are some expectations - and a busy schedule comes as part of the price.</p>
      <p>We all see the Royal Family out at public engagements, but how do they fill their time behind clothes doors?</p>
      <p>Do they like to put their feet up and watch Coronation Street, are they excited for the next series of The Crown dropping on Netflix, or do they get pleasure in cooking, reading or shopping?</p>
      <p>Our colleagues at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/heres-what-royal-family-actually-12036658">The Mirror have put together a list</a> of what some of the most-loved Royals do in their spare time.</p>
      <h3>The Queen</h3>

      <p>For a woman in her 90s later this year, Queen Elizabeth is very busy.</p>
      <p>Typically she's woken up at 7.30am to bagpipe music and then she spends time doing paperwork.</p>
      <p>The Queen spends her days answering letters, giving out knighthoods, having meetings with her staff and meeting and greeting diplomats, bishops, judges and military top dogs.</p>
      <p>Because she's the Queen and has to be organised, she reportedly allocates 20 minutes to each and knows, subliminally, when those 20 minutes is up.</p>
      <p>When her paperwork and meetings are done, it's thought she takes her dogs for a walk.</p>
      <p>In the early evening, she studies a report of the day's parliamentary proceedings and on Wednesdays the Queen has an audience with the Prime Minister,  <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhome.bt.com%2Flifestyle%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fwhat-does-the-queen-have-for-breakfast-a-day-in-the-life-of-her-majesty-11364001526222&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fweird-news%2Fheres-what-royal-family-actually-12036658">BT</a>  reports.</p>
      <p>She's also said to enjoy photography as a hobby, just like her grandaughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
      <h3>Prince Charles</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Perhaps once he's king more details will emerge, but for now all we know is he heads up 13 Prince's Charities, including The Prince's Trust, The British Asian Trust and Business in the Community.</p>
      <p>So presumably all of these keep him busy.</p>
      <p>A keen gardener, Charles has also authored two books on ecology, Harmony: A New Way of Looking At The World, and On the Future of Food.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but he also devotes time to another hobby of his, watercolour painting, though the reviews have not been kind.</p>
      <p>The Duchy of Cornwall is also a decent money-spinner, which is just as well, as according to Mentalfloss, he forks out £1million a year for each of his sons.</p>
      <p>Be right back, just calling our dad...</p>
      <h3>Prince William</h3>

      <p>Since quitting his part-time job for the East Anglian air ambulance, Prince William has focused on parenting and royal commitments.</p>
      <p>Amid criticism of him being "workshy", he talked about his readiness to do more in the way of royal duties in an interview with the  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/19/prince-william-queen-support/">BBC</a>  , saying he was also "concentrating very much on my role as a father.</p>
      <p>He gave <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/prince-william-gives-insight-private-3519407">a rare insight in to his private life when speaking to music legend Eric Clapton at an event this month</a>.</p>
      <p>They talked about a mutual interest, which may have been their love for the Caribbean island of Mustique.</p>
      <p>He also said he spends much of his spare time asleep - I guess that's often the case when you've got three children.</p>
      <h3>The Duchess of Cambridge</h3>

      <p>The duchess is a full-time mum but, like William, she has also assumed more royal duties recently.</p>
      <p>Just like the Queen she's a keen photographer and has been given honorary lifetime membership of the prestigious Royal Photographic Society in recognition of her 'talent and enthusiasm'.</p>
      <p>Eagle-eyed royal watchers have spotted her on the school run and taking the kids swimming at the pool in Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>In 2017 she also teamed up with her husband and Prince Harry to launch Heads Together, which will no doubt take up some of her time.</p>
