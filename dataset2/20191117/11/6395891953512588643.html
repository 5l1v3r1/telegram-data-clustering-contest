      <p><a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">According to the Daily Hampshire Gazette</a> and <a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/crime/arraignment-scheduled-for-father-after-5-year-old-son-brought-cocaine-school-in-holyoke/">WWLP-TV</a>, authorities charged Benny Garcia, 29, of Holyoke, with drug possession and reckless endangerment after an H.B. Lawrence Elementary School kindergarten teacher saw the 5-year-old with the Spider-Man-stamped bag Thursday morning. The teacher said the boy claimed that eating or tasting the substance, which he found in his family's living room, transforms him into the iconic superhero, <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">the Gazette reported</a>. </p>
      <p>First responders took the boy to a nearby hospital, where doctors examined him, Holyoke police said. He appeared to be unhurt, <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">the Gazette reported</a>. Authorities said they weren't sure whether the child, who had placed the sealed baggie in his mouth, ended up ingesting any of the drug, <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">according to the newspaper</a>. </p>
      <p>Investigators later searched the boy's home and found Garcia sleeping, police said. Authorities seized more than 170 bags of heroin and 48 bags of cocaine from the apartment, <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">the Gazette reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Garcia, who pleaded not guilty to his charges, remains in jail without bond, <a href="https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-drug-arrest-30437946">the news outlets</a> <a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/crime/arraignment-scheduled-for-father-after-5-year-old-son-brought-cocaine-school-in-holyoke/">reported</a>.
