      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Personal doctor of ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Dr Adnan on Sunday has said that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo will leave for London once his health is clinically stabilized.</p>
      <p>In a post on social-networking website Twitter, Dr Adnan said that Nawaz Sharif will travel to United Kingdom for medical treatment within 48 hours. "He will make the journey in a fully equipped and medically staffed Air Ambulance which is arriving soon," he added.  </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, sources told that the former premier will be shifted to the Harley Street Clinic in London immediately after landing.</p>
      <p>With the flying fuel of 10 hours and two pilots, the air ambulance will be equipped with oxygen cylinders, ventilators, ICU and other medical facilities, while two doctors, including Sharif’s personal physician Dr Adnan, and paramedics will also assist the PML-N supremo during his travel.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Saturday, Lahore High Court (LHC) had ordered to remove Nawaz Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL) and allowed him to travel abroad to get health treatment for four weeks.</p>
      <p>The court had also rejected the condition of indemnity bond to be submitted by Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>Nawaz, who was imprisoned after an accountability court found him guilty in the Al Azizia corruption reference, had also been granted bail by the Islamabad High Court on humanitarian grounds. He also obtained bail in the Chaudhry Sugar Mills case, in which he is a suspect, from the LHC.</p>
