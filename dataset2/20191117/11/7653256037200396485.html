      <p>New Delhi: An <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NDA">NDA</a> convener should be appointed for better coordination among alliance partners, newly appointed <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Lok-Jan-Shakti">Lok Jan Shakti</a> party chief <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Chirag-Paswan">Chirag Paswan</a> said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Paswan, speaking to reporters after an NDA meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament, said <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a>'s absence was felt at the meet as it was one of the oldest National Democratic Alliance member.</p>
      <p>"There should be better coordination among allies and an NDA convener should be appointed," he said. <br/>It's a matter of concern that the Telugu Desam Party left the alliance first and then the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rashtriya-Lok-Samata">Rashtriya Lok Samata</a> Party did.</p>
      <p>"But all of us (allies) will work together in the upcoming session and more such meetings should happen," said Paswan, who was appointed the LJP chief earlier this month.</p>
