      <p>The 2020 Olympic men’s marathon will be held on its originally scheduled date of Aug. 9 despite the event’s relocation from Tokyo to Sapporo, sources close to the matter said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The International Olympic Committee’s decision to shift the Olympic marathon and race-walking events to Sapporo due to concerns over Tokyo’s heat was reluctantly accepted by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Tokyo Games organizing committee chief Yoshiro Mori had said on Nov. 7 that the men’s marathon schedule would “change greatly” as it would be “impossible” to hold the event in Sapporo on the same day as the closing ceremony in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Athletes will have to travel over 800 km after the race in Sapporo in order to attend the closing ceremony in Japan’s capital, a task further complicated by the time required for doping tests and other procedures.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, however, IOC Coordination Commission Chairman John Coates said the IOC wanted to keep the men’s marathon on the final day.</p>
      <p>Coates said athletes would have to be flown to Tokyo for the closing ceremony, where they would be presented with medals per recent Olympic tradition.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Games organizing committee as well as the governments of Sapporo and Hokkaido will hold a second round of administrative talks on Monday to settle on plans for the new marathon course, largely based on the course used for the annual Hokkaido Marathon.</p>
