      <h1>Meet the South Shields man impaled on 20ft railing that moved his heart but lived to tell the tale</h1>
      <h2>Richard Stephenson was injured in the crash in Cumbria which moved his heart 3mm</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:56:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jeremy Armstrong</a></address>
      <p>A man who was impaled through the chest with a 20ft-long fence railing has told how it moved his heart 3mm....yet he miraculously survived.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-shields">South Shields</a> -born Richard Stephenson, 23, was front seat passenger in his friend’s car when it careered off the road and crashed.  </p>
      <p>It hit a wooden fence and sent the giant railing at blistering speed through the front of the car - and straight into Richard's chest.  </p>
      <p>Incredibly, surgeons told how his heart had been moved three millimetres to the side by the sheer force of the impact.   </p>
      <p>The wooden missile passed through his chest, just missing his heart, and out his back.    </p>
      <p>It broke three and a half ribs, left him with a third of his right lung, and caused bowel and kidney damage before he had part of his intenstine removed.  </p>
      <p>Richard was taken by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/great-north-air-ambulance-service">Great North Air Ambulance Service</a> (GNAAS) from the scene close to Workington, in Cumbria, to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle.</p>
      <p>He still has bits of wood and bone 'floating around' inside his body following the crash on October 18, 2018. </p>
      <p>But he said: "I would not be here were it not for the surgeons, doctors and air ambulance paramedics. It really is remarkable that I survived.   </p>
      <p>"When I woke up after three days I could not feel my legs.  I panicked at first, they told me that was because I had been sedated.   </p>
      <p>"I regained movement, then walked.   I have no memory at all of the accident - it stops at the day before, then three days afterwards.    </p>
      <p>"The surgeon told me my heart had moved across three millimetres to the side but it kept beating."   </p>
      <p>Back home after five weeks and three days in hospital, the car valet worker added: "I am so lucky to be here. I appreciate everything about life now.   </p>

      <p>"It gives you a different perspective. The little things that bothered me before - I realise now they are just not that important."  </p>
      <p>Dr John Ferris, a rapid response doctor who was one of the first on the scene, could hear Richard moaning as he approached. "I began to feel reassured that he must have escaped serious injury," he said.</p>
      <p>"But as I came around the side of the car it became quickly apparent that this was going to be that once in a career job where your skills are stretched to the maximum and beyond.</p>
      <p>“On removal from the car, Richard developed respiratory failure and began to show all the signs of a patient about to die. Between us we rapidly anaesthetised him, and operated on his chest to stabilise him, preparing him for flight. <br/><br/>“I remember watching the helicopter fly away from scene thinking that it would be a miracle if he were to survive.” </p>
      <p>The pole was cut on the chest side, with Richard given ketamin as a painkiller. At the RVI, consultant in emergency medicine Dr Jonathan ‘Doogie’ Howes, who also works for GNAAS, told how surgery had to remove the damaged organs. </p>
      <p>“Richard underwent an op to remove the wood, but ended up losing part of his right lung.</p>
      <p>He then went into intensive care," he said.  His mum Michelle, 56, who works in catering, and stepdad Ian Wood, 65, remained at his bedside.</p>
      <p>The story features on Emergency Helicopter Medics on Sunday on More4.</p>
