        <b>ARTHUR NUMAN has lifted the lid on his transfer to Rangers and how he made Dick Advocaat his personal flight attendant.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new Feyenoord boss, who will come up against his old employers in the Europa League last this month, left PSV for Ibrox in 1998.</p>

      <p>Numan was made his first priority signing - despite interest from the likes of Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Advocaat made it clear to the defender he would be following him to Glasgow and Numan has told how he had a bit of fun with his boss on David Murray's private jet.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.sundaypost.com/">Sunday Post:</a> "I remember the day Dick pulled me aside, quietly, and told me he was going to Glasgow Rangers and that I was going with him.</p>
      <p>"He made it clear he wanted to sign me.</p>

      <p>"I told him I wanted to consider other options because I knew Atletico Madrid also wanted me.</p>
      <p>"But he made it clear I was going to Rangers and that was the end of the conversation.</p>
      <p>"Before I signed we flew over to Scotland from Holland in David Murray's private jet.</p>
      <p>"I think there was only three people on the plane.</p>

      <p>"I decided to have a bit of fun with Dick, so I told him that if he wanted me to sign then he should make me a coffee and bring me sandwiches. Oh the look he gave me!</p>
      <p>"I had a good laugh seeing dick being my personal flight attendant!."</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard's current <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> crop travel to Rotterdam on November 28 knowing a victory will see them join <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> in the Europa League last 32.</p>
      <p>Numan, who will be in attendance at the match, loved his time with the Light Blues and has hailed Rangers' 'unique' support.</p>
      <p>He added: "Speaking from my own point of view, Rangers was the most fantastic football club to play for. It's special, very special.</p>
      <p>"I still go back to Glasgow six or seven times a year. The supporters treat me brilliantly, like a king, to be honest.</p>
      <p>"When I have friends or family over from Holland with me they cannot believe the adulation and warmness because it doesn't happen in Holland.</p>
      <p>"I can walk down the street in Holland and nobody will look at me twice. It's different in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"Mikey Mols, Bert Konterman and all the lads will tell you the same thing. Glasgow and the Rangers supporters are so unique.</p>
      <p>"The Dutch guys all love the club. That's why all come back time after time.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure Dick feels the same. I had conversations with him and I know he felt something very special for Rangers.</p>
      <p>"He loved the Treble success of 1999 and the Champions League nights. He just wanted to win more games and do even better. We all did."</p>
