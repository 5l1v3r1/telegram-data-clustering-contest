      <p>Plastic pipes and vehicles outside a State infrastructure agency godown were set ablaze in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district on November 17, a day after farmers clashed with the police demanding adequate compensation for their land acquired for an upcoming township.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred around 11 a.m. outside the godown of the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA), which acquired the land for the Trans-Ganga City project near Kanpur, officials said.</p>
      <p>“Some anti-social elements had set fire to plastic pipes kept outside the godown. Apart from this, two vehicles were also set afire,” Additional District Magistrate Rakesh Singh said.</p>
      <p>The fire has been controlled to a significant extent and there has been no loss of life, Mr. Singh said. “Action will be initiated against those who had set the portion of the godown on fire.”</p>
      <p>“No farmer has so far claimed responsibility for Sunday’s act, which means that the work has been done by anti-social elements,” District Magistrate Devendra Kumar Pandey said.</p>
      <p>On November 16, farmers demanding better compensation for their land clashed with the police when government officials visited the project site to clear the encroachment.</p>
      <p>Several farmers were injured as the police baton-charged them, used tear gas and water cannons. Many police personnel were also injured as the protesters targeted them with stones.</p>
      <p>“No one will be allowed to play with law and order,” the District Magistrate said, making an appeal to the villagers to help maintaining peace.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Kisan Manch (RKM), a forum working for welfare of farmers, claimed that the farmers were not indulging in violent protests and were only demanding adequate compensation for their land.</p>
      <p>“Nearly 30% of the farmers of the clash-hit area are yet to get compensation from the government,” RKM president Shekhar Dixit said on November 17.</p>
      <p>“The farmers were not indulging in violent protests and only demanding adequate compensation for their land. Is their demand unjustified?” Mr. Dixit asked.</p>
      <p>The District Magistrate, however, had said on November 16 that the farmers had been adequately compensated.</p>
      <p>The farmers’ outfit also demanded that all the officials involved in the baton charge should be sacked.</p>
