      <p>The Prelate of Methodist Church Nigeria, His Eminence, Dr. Samuel Uche has charged church leaders to always speak truth to power and avoid dabbling into partisan politics.<br/>Uche spoke during a chat with our correspondent at the Consecration and Investiture of Archdiocesan Lay President and Diocesan Lay Presidents at Methodist Church of Trinity, Tinubu, Lagos.<br/>The investiture of three bishops, three Archbishops, seven Archdiocesan Lay Presidents, 13 Diocesan Lay Presidents took place during the service.<br/>Popular businessman, Sir Kessington Adebutu, was also installed as Pillar of Methodist in Nigeria.<br/>Uche advised ministers of God to stay away from politics, stating “we are representing God and if we join politics, we will become partisan.”<br/>He explained: “No ministers of God should be partisan because all political parties belong to us and we belong to all the parties. All we should emphasise is good governance all level of government.”<br/>The Prelate told the new Bishops to consider their appointment for evangelism, which is the cardinal commitment of the church.<br/>In his sermon, The Archbishop of RIYE Province, Methodist Church Nigeria, Rev Adegbemi Adewale, appealed to the newly ordained priests to continue to live in readiness of Christ ‘return as they serve God.<br/>He wondered what will be their gains if they have all the titles as Bishops and lose their souls in hell.<br/>Adewale decried the level of decadence within the body of Christ, lamenting many God’s servants have been involved in untoward acts.</p>
