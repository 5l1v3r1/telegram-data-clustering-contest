      <h3>A HOUSE leader on Sunday urged Vice President Leni Robredo “to destroy the demand for illegal drugs by sending as many abusers as possible to compulsory rehabilitation.”</h3>
      <p>“There are two sides to the drug problem – the supply side and the demand side. We have to suppress both sides at once if we are to succeed in the war on drugs,” said Anakalusugan party-list Rep. Mike Defensor, who chairs the House Committee on Public Accounts.</p>
      <p>Defensor, vice chairperson of the House health committee, called for “sweeping demand reduction strategies” that include hard-hitting preventive education drives to discourage new drug users, and greater access to government-subsidized rehabilitation services for existing abusers.</p>
      <p>“In other countries, demand reduction is a proven approach in cutting down supply. With less abusers, supply also drops as the market for drugs shrinks,” Defensor pointed out.</p>
      <p>Citing figures from the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), Defensor said that in 2018 alone, only 5,447 abusers were admitted to 54 public and private residential and outpatient treatment facilities.</p>
      <p>“We have a multitude of abusers. Yet, only a few of them are undergoing either voluntary or compulsory rehabilitation,” Defensor said.</p>
      <p>“Our strategy with respect to abusers should be: You either go to rehab, or you go to jail,” Defensor said.</p>
      <p>At present, Defensor said the country has “extremely limited” public drug treatment centers, with just one or two in every region.</p>
      <p>In the P4.1-trillion 2020 budget, Defensor said the Department of Health is getting only P1.18 billion for the operation of 21 rehabilitation facilities nationwide.</p>
      <p>“Considering how bad our drug problem is, we should have at least one rehabilitation center in every province,” Defensor said.</p>
      <p>“Around Metro Manila, where there is a high concentration of abusers, we should have several treatment hubs,” Defensor said.</p>
