      <p>Gospel singer, Tope Van-Lare, popularly called Tope Calculator, has appealed to Christian artists to stay focus on delivering clean and pure songs that will impact lives for Christ.</p>
      <p>Van-Lare said this at the public launch of her new song and five track video titled Odironyedikagi featuring Emapraise and Assumpta and Calculator.<br/>She said there were tendencies for gospel artists to compromise because of peculiar gains but they must make frantic effort to stay true to their calling in delivering songs that save souls and prepare men for heaven.<br/>According to her: “You can make the money, it is not about money, though money is good, it makes lives easier but there is something beyond this lives which is about winning souls for Christ.<br/>“Gospel artistes should not give up their calling despite the present economic situation of the country.<br/>“Let’s look towards delivering songs with quality messages that touches lives because, one might gain fame and make millions but after that, what else? Let us stay focused and win souls for God.”<br/>On what inspired the song, the talented musician, who started singing at 13, said she got inspired to write the track Odironyedikagi while working in a laboratory.<br/>She stated it took her more than a year to writes the songs.<br/>Van-Lanre, a graduate of Biochemistry from the University of Benin and University of Lagos, said: “The song is basically for worship and a reflection of the incredible and indescribable nature of God.<br/>“It speaks about the endless power of God and how our lives revolve around Him.<br/>“It is the message of the songs that have positive messages. We are in a delicate period and the economy is bad.<br/>“I want Nigerians to find joy from within. It does not depend on their bank account or physical wealth.”<br/>Asked how she balances working with singing, she said: “I can’t do music alone for now. Besides, I love my job, especially as it pertains to health. So my music and job kind of complement each other—one is the physical, the other spiritual.”</p>
