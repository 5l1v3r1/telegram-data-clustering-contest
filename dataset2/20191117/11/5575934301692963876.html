      <p>Prince Andrew’s chief spin doctor reportedly quit his role just two weeks before the Duke of York’s sit-down interview with the BBC, after strongly advising him against doing the interview.</p>
      <p>Jason Stein left by mutual consent just four weeks into his role as the Prince’s press advisor, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307">The Times newspaper reports.</a></p>
      <p>On Saturday night, BBC’s Newsnight programme aired a lengthy interview with Prince Andrew, in which presenter Emily Maitlis questioned the Queen’s son about his links to convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Stein – who used to work for ex-UK government minister, Amber Rudd – rowed with the Prince’s private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, who was advising him to accept the BBC’s offer of an interview, The Times report adds.</p>
      <p>Aides to the Queen and Prince’s Andrew brother, Prince Charles, were reportedly alarmed by his decision to accept the interview.</p>
      <p>“This will go down as one of the single worst PR moves in recent history,” a source close to Buckingham Palace told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>The interview was aired at 21:00 UK time on Saturday. It came as the Prince tries to rebuild his reputation following damaging revelations about his relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>In the interview, he faced a number of questions relating to his decision to stay in Epstein’s Manhattan home 18 months after the financier completed a prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>

      <p>Giuffre alleged that in 2001, when she was 17-years-old, she dined with the Prince in London, and together they went to a nightclub in the English capital called Tramp, before having sex.</p>
      <p>The Prince said this “didn’t happen” and that “there are a number of things that are wrong with that story.”</p>
      <p>He disputed Giuffre’s suggestion that he was “sweating” profusely on the night in question, claiming he had a medical condition which means he sweats less than the average person.</p>
