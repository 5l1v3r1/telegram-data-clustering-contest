      <p>Tzofit Naim, 29, from Netivot, called an ambulance when she started to feel her baby arriving. When Magen David Adom (Israel's ambulance service)arrived they understood that they cannot delay in taking her to hospital.</p>
      <p>Led by paramedic Ofir Peretz, Naim had a healthy birth in the ambulance. "It happened so fast, I never thought I would give birth so quickly. The ambulance team were amazing, their smiles and encouragement, it was so important."</p>
      <p>A few days after her birth, Naim visited the Mada station in Netivot, meeting the medical team that helped her give birth and gave them a letter of thanks."A team of angels, you were gentle, you said the right words and were so professional," wrote Naim. "Thank you for your patience, care, sensitivity, smiles and professionalism."</p>
      <p>Peretz said, "I'm a paramedic in Mada a number of years already and I have learnt to act calmly and professionally in many varied medical emergencies. I am very grateful to Tzofit for her thanks, it is very sweet and emotional."</p>
