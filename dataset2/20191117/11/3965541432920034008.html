      <p>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Spokane County is seeing an increase in people seeking legal protection orders because of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>The Spokesman Review reported Sunday that every month for the past several months, the number of orders has reached more than 500 as compared to a previous average of 300 a month.</p>
      <p>The uptick has sparked a new initiative to speed up and improve police response rates to domestic violence calls in the county.</p>
      <p>Authorities aren’t sure why protection orders are increasing in the county.</p>
      <p>Before the improvements, it took hours for word of a court-approved protection order to reach police officers in the field.</p>
      <p>Now, the information is available almost immediately, making it more likely police will have all the information they need when they respond to a domestic violence call.</p>
