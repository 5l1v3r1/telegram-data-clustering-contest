      <h1>Holly Hagan wows with sophisticated makeover for Butterfly Ball in figure-hugging dress</h1>
      <h2>Geordie Shore star looked stunning in the scarlet gown which matched the red carpet at the charity bash</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/holly-hagan">Holly Hagan</a> had jaws dropping to the floor as she debuted a sophisticated makeover for the Butterfly Ball.</p>
      <p>The Geordie Shore OG star looked incredible in the full-length backless strappy gown, which matched the red carpet at the charity bash.</p>
      <p>Bride-to-be Holly showcased her hourglass body in the figure-hugging scarlet dress with a plunging neckline, that was held up by some worryingly thin straps.</p>
      <p>The bold dress made sure a glowing Holly stood out on the red carpet, where she was joined by her pal Tyne-Lexy Carson.</p>
      <p>Holly accessorised with perfectly coiffed blonde waves and glittering gold jewellery and a handbag.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old reality star, who recently got engaged to Macclesfield Town player Jacob Blyth, was a far cry from her usual skin-baring attire.</p>
      <p>It's often that we'll see the reality babe in crop tops, bikinis or skin-tight bodysuits that reveals her gorgeous curves.</p>
      <p>Holly has made no secret of the fact that she's had surgery over the years and even joked over the summer that it was hard to tell the Geordie Shore girls apart because of their love for using the 'same surgeon'.</p>

      <p>Now after years of drinking on Geordie Shore Holly recently spoke about how she is taking more care of herself.</p>
      <p>She is currently appearing on new MTV show Geordie OGs alongside Gary Beadle, Aaron Chalmers and Marnie Simpson.</p>
      <p>The newly engaged star confessed she's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/holly-hagan-planning-three-hen-19023692">cut back on her drinking</a> to look after her skin.</p>

      <p>"I’m glad I don’t have to drink so much anymore as I am really into my skincare and alcohol is so bad for your skin!</p>
      <p>"That’s the good thing about OGs because you get to see a real look into our actual lives - aside from drunken moments!"</p>
      <p>She added: "I'm looking forward to being with my Geordies next month, Its been eight years since I started the show! I usually get compared to Chloe Ferry which we always laugh about."</p>
