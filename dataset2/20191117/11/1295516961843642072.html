      <h1>The Simpsons: Disney+ Will Add Original Uncropped Episodes - But Not Yet</h1>

      <p>While <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-simpsons/"><i>The Simpsons</i></a> is available to stream in its entirety on Disney+, viewers have noticed that the episodes have been cropped to fit the streaming platform's aspect ratio, resulting in vital sight gags and other details being trimmed out of frame. Fortunately, this is poised to change next year.</p>
      <p>Due to fan outcry, Disney has announced it will restore earlier seasons to its original aspect ratio of 4:3 sometime in early 2020. In a written statement, Disney explained that the decision to crop the first seasons to the current aspect ratio of 16:9 was to match the visual consistency of more recent episodes that switched to the more modern, high definition presentation. A sample of the current cropping and its effects are below.</p>

      <p>Following Disney's acquisition of Fox earlier this year, Disney announced plans to include several notable Fox properties on to Disney+ at launch, including all 30 seasons of <i>The Simpsons</i> and National Graphic programming.</p>
      <p>Prior to the acquisition, Fox renewed the popular animated series for its 31st and 32nd seasons, as it continues to be the longest-running scripted television series of all time, with 713 episodes currently produced and counting.</p>
      <p><i>The Simpsons</i> was created by Matt Groening and developed by James L. Brooks, Groening and Sam Simon. Brooks, Groening and Al Jean are executive producers of the series from Gracie Films Production in association with 20th Century Fox Television. The series airs Sunday nights at 8 p.m. on Fox.</p>
