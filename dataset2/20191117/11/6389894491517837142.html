      <h1>Saudi Aramco set for $1.7 trillion valuation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:22:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Thicknesse</a></address>
      <p>Saudi Aramco has released the official price range for its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) in December, giving the company a preliminary value between $1.6 trillion (£1.24 trillion) to $1.7 trillion.</p>
      <p>Although this is considerably below the company’s desire for a $2 trillion valuation, it would still make the IPO the world’s biggest.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In a statement on Sunday Aramco said that they would sell 1.5 per cent of the company’s shares on Riyadh’s Tadawul exchange at a price of 30 (£6.20) to 32 riyals.</p>
      <p>At the top end of the price range a sale of this size would give the oil giant a value of $25.6bn, just surpassing the $25bn raised by Chinese retailer Alibaba in its debut in New York in 2014. </p>
      <p>The final offer price will be announced on 5 December. </p>
      <p>The sale is expected to be hugely popular with Saudi nationals, for whom 0.5 per cent of the shares have been reserved.</p>
      <p>Retail investors have until Nov. 28 to sign up for the IPO while institutional investors can subscribe until Dec. 4, with company management going on marketing roadshows this week.</p>
      <p>After much delay Aramco’s IPO process began on 3 November, with the sale a central pillar of Crown Price Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to diversify the gulf state’s economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>There had been much speculation from investors as to the value of the world’s most profitable company, with a range as wide as $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.</p>
      <p>Aramco, which produces 10 per cent of the world’s oil, was initially expected to sell up to 5 per cent of its shares, with both a local and an international offering. </p>

      <p>However, plans to list on an overseas exchange have now been shelved.</p>
      <p>For the first nine months of 2019, Saudi Aramco’s income slipped from $83.3bn in 2018 to $68.2bn this year, with revenues down from $233.3bn to $217.1bn.</p>
