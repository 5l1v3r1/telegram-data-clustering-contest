      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> isn't afraid of poking a little fun at himself, or his former One Direction bandmates.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old singer was hosting American comedy show Saturday Night Live for the first time when he delivered the funny but scathing monologue.</p>
      <p>After joking that he would be spending as much time with the live audience as his 'serious relationships', the former boybander went on to make a quip about Zayn Malik leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/one-direction-still-earn-38000-20816401">One Direction</a> .</p>
      <p>Mentioning the group which made him famous, Harry said he thought of the lads as his family, before teasing the audience about them being there on the show.</p>

      <p>As he reeled off their names Harry appeared to struggle over Zayn, who parted ways with the band before they officially announced their split.</p>
      <p>"I love those guys, they're my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis... Uh.. Ringo! Yeah, that's it."</p>
      <p>Ringo Starr famously left The Beatles back in 1968, he quit the band for five months while they were recording their self-titled album, he later returned before they split for good in 1970.</p>

      <p>Proving a point that he was a serious musician Harry said: "I'm not in a boyband anymore. I'm in a man band."</p>
      <p>Referring to One Direction, he smirked as the audience cheered: "How crazy would it be if they were here tonight?</p>
      <p>"They're not though. But wouldn't it be crazy if they were...? But they're not."</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm so grateful <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> grew us in those test tubes."</p>

      <p>Making reference to the many people he's been linked with in the media throughout his career, Harry introduced himself to the audience.</p>
      <p>"And just like all my serious relationships, were gonna spend one incredible night together and then never see each other again."</p>
      <p>He spent the rest of his monologue appearing to play a black grand piano, before lifting up his hands to take a sip of a cocktail.</p>
      <p>The singer, who is set to release his second album on December 13, also performed comedy skits alongside the SNL cast as well as Jon Hamm.</p>
