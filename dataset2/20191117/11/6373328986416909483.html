        <b>Milk and beer: the two founding fathers of breakfast. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing screams British suburbia more than a crisp, glass bottle of milk being delivered to your door every morning.</p>
      <p>However, one dairy company is changing the game. That’s right, your milkman can now leave bottles of beer on your doorstep.</p>

      <p>I live in a block of flats, so having that liquid calcium hand-delivered to me during the week isn’t really an option (yes, I could get my shopping delivered via Tesco or Asda etc, but it’s not the same).</p>
      <p>Milk deliveries aren’t as common as they used to be: what used to be standard procedure for households across the country can seem like a rarity for some.</p>
      <p>Facing years of declining sales, dairy giant Milk &amp; More came up with an ingenious plan: offer 330ml bottles of low-alcohol lager, pale ale and brown ale along with people’s morning milk.</p>

      <p>Up until the 1970s, nearly everyone had milk delivered. But, then came the supermarkets, with cheaper milk and plastic bottles, essentially choking out the local competition.</p>
      <p>But, as Bob Dylan sang, the times they are a-changin’ – people aren’t quite as keen these days to invest in countless plastic cartons. Thousands are starting to make the switch back to glass in a small bid to help protect the planet.</p>

      <p>As per the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/business/milkman-now-deliver-you-beer-20895050?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=mirror_main&amp;fbclid=IwAR3gpyZ0mPfo-mMcvpPaoXmtmChbNkH6LgDNrxuItwGNfL-CugBq5FSnctU"><i>Mirror Online</i></a>, the number of doorstep drops has jumped from 800,000 a day to a million over the past two years.</p>
      <p>It’s all good news for Milk &amp; More, which uses electric carts to serve 500,000 homes. After being relaunched by German giant Müller last year, it has since linked up with Ipswich-based brewer Big Drop. For just £1.99 per bottle, you can get beer delivered by your milkman.</p>
      <p>Dairy and grain – what a treat.</p>
