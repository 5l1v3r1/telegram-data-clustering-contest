      <h1>Woman's £2 hack makes mouldy shower tiles look as good as new</h1>
      <h2>It's simple and effective</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:26:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:26</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Mould is one of the most common (and annoying) things to clean and get rid of in our homes.</p>
      <p>It can be particularly bad in bathrooms, especially around the shower area because of damp areas which have poor air circulation.</p>
      <p>Trying to get rid of it can be incredibly tricky, but one woman claims to have found a solution, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/womans-tip-making-mouldy-shower-20875722">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>In a post on a  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cleaning">cleaning</a>  tips and tricks  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>  group, an unnamed woman revealed she'd found a simple hack for removing mould without doing an intense scrubbing - and it only cost around £2 to do.</p>
      <p>The woman initially posted a photo of her mouldy grouting on the group, asking fellow members for suggestions on how to get them looking good as new.</p>

      <p>Many people responded to her post, sharing ideas, including using toilet bowl cleaner and just re-sealing the tiles.</p>
      <p>After trying a few of the  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/life-hacks">hacks</a>  out, she finally found one that really did the trick, and all she needed were cotton wool and bleach to do it.</p>
      <p>The woman claims she soaked a piece of the cotton wool in the cleaning product and packed them all around the edges of the tiles.</p>

      <p>The cotton wool was left on the tiles overnight and by the morning, the difference was incredible.</p>
      <p>She re-shared her original photo as well as a new one showing the results of the cleaning trick.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to everyone who has commented," she said. "I used cotton wool and bleach and have attached photos of the results. Wow!"</p>
      <p>Dozens of people liked her post, with one person commented: "This is amazing!"</p>
