      <p>Georgia edged past Alabama to No. 4 in The Associated Press college football poll after the Bulldogs had a quality road victory and the Crimson Tide lost star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for the season.</p>
      <p>LSU remained No. 1 in the AP Top 25 presented by Regions Bank, receiving 54 first-places votes. No. 2 Ohio State (five first-place votes) and No. 3 Clemson (three first-place votes) maintained their spots. Georgia moved up one place after winning 21-14 at Auburn.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide beat Mississippi State 38-7 on Saturday, but Tagovailoa dislocated his right hip while being tackled late in the second quarter and is done for the year. Alabama fell a spot to fifth.</p>
      <p>Minnesota and Baylor both lost for the first time and dropped in the rankings. The 11th-ranked Gophers slipped four spots after losing at Iowa. No. 13 Baylor dropped one after blowing a 28-3 lead at home to Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Iowa jumped four to No. 19 and Oklahoma moved up two spots to No. 8.</p>
      <p>POLL POINTS</p>
      <p>There is more separation at the top of college football this season than last. At this point in 2018, the AP Top 25 had:</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>— Four unbeaten teams.</p>
      <p>— Eight one-loss teams.</p>
      <p>— Three two-loss teams.</p>
      <p>— Eight three-loss teams.</p>
      <p>— Two four-loss teams.</p>
      <p>The latest poll has:</p>
      <p>— Three unbeaten teams.</p>
      <p>— 13 one-loss teams.</p>
      <p>— Four two-loss teams.</p>
      <p>— Five three-loss teams.</p>
      <p>TOP-FIVE TIDE</p>
      <p>Alabama extended its record for consecutive weeks in the top five of the AP poll to 67, dating back to Nov. 8, 2015. The second-longest streak of top-five appearances is Miami, which had 55 from Oct. 8, 2000-Oct. 26, 2003.</p>
      <p>Breakdown of the streak:</p>
      <p>— No. 1 — 49.</p>
      <p>— No. 2 — 12.</p>
      <p>— No. 3 — 2.</p>
      <p>— No. 4 — 2.</p>
      <p>— No. 5 — 2.</p>
      <p>IN</p>
      <p>— No. 23 Appalachian State moved into the rankings for the second time this season.</p>
      <p>— No. 24 Texas A&amp;M returned to the Top 25. The Aggies started the season in No. 12, but losses to Clemson, Auburn and Alabama dropped them out. A&amp;M has won four straight.</p>
      <p>— No. 25 Virginia Tech is ranked for the first time this season. It has been quite a bounce-back for the Hokies, who suffered their worst home loss in decades against Duke in September but have won five of six since.</p>
      <p>OUT</p>
      <p>— Navy was bounced after being routed at Notre Dame.</p>
      <p>— Texas fell out of the rankings again after a last-second loss to Iowa State.</p>
      <p>— Indiana lasted one week in the rankings after a 25-year absence. The Hoosiers lost at Penn State.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>CONFERENCE CALL</p>
      <p>Big Ten — 6 (Nos. 2, 9, 11, 12, 14, 19).</p>
      <p>SEC — 6 (Nos. 1, 4, 5, 10, 16, 24).</p>
      <p>American — 3 (Nos. 17, 18, 21).</p>
      <p>Big 12 — 3 (Nos. 8, 13, 22).</p>
      <p>ACC — 2 (Nos. 3, 25).</p>
      <p>Pac 12 — 2 (Nos. 6, 7).</p>
      <p>Mountain West — 1 (No. 20).</p>
      <p>Sun Belt — 1 (No. 23).</p>
      <p>Independent — 1 (No. 15).</p>
      <p>RANKED vs. RANKED</p>
      <p>No. 9 Penn State at No. 2 Ohio State. The Buckeyes have been rolling, but they still have their heaviest lifting to do.</p>
      <p>No. 24 Texas A&amp;M at No. 4 Georgia. The Aggies are positioned to complicate things in the SEC, with the Bulldogs this week and LSU next.</p>
