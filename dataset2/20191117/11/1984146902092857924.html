      <p>Geordie teenager Elliot Anderson once gazed down from Level 7 of the Leazes End in admiration of Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa as a kid and dreamt that one day he would get the chance to run out on the hallowed turf at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>At just 16-years-old earlier this season, Anderson sprinted on to the field against Swansea reserves to achieve such a feat but, after penning a new contract on his 17th birthday this month, the next step for the North Shields youngster will be the biggest.</p>
      <p>As it stands he has squad No 67 at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> and he is some way from Cabaye's old number four, but he is on the right track.</p>
      <p>Anderson, an attacking midfielder who has been at the club since the age of nine after being spotted at Wallsend Boys Club, has had some exciting moments in recent times after signing his first professional contract and then netting his first competitive goal for the club in the EFL Trophy at Port Vale.</p>
      <p>The teenager is trying to take things in his stride but knows he is now living the dream of thousands of other kids on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>He told the Sunday Sun: "I was a supporter of the team as a kid.</p>
      <p>"I watched players like <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/yohan-cabaye">Yohan Cabaye,</a> Hatem Ben Arfa and Peter Lovenkrands.</p>
      <p>"I used to watch from right at the top of Level 7 so it is quite surreal to be around the place now.</p>
      <p>"I just continue to work hard though."</p>

      <p>His first goal may have come in a dead rubber group match in this year's EFL Trophy and in the end, it counted for nothing on the night.</p>
      <p>But from a United point of view, it was the highlight and the 23 fans who still opted to back the Under-21 team in the competition on a freezing November night in Burslem may go on to say they were there when Anderson scored his first big goal for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>He reflected: "I'm buzzing to score my first competitive goal for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"But the lads did well overall, we came out against a League Two side and put in a good performance.</p>
      <p>"It was nice to score.</p>

      <p>"It was great to play up to Jamie Sterry, he managed to put in a good ball and I got on the end of it.</p>
      <p>"I am happy.</p>
      <p>"I did well in the first half then came out in the second which was good for my confidence.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy to be doing it for my hometown team.</p>
      <p>"It was a good moment for me but I will work hard and continue.</p>
      <p>"It has been a busy time for me."</p>

      <p>United enjoyed a run to the last 16 of the competition last season but this year a much younger side were out of the tournament by the second group game after losing both opening games at Macclesfield and Shrewsbury.</p>
      <p>Anderson said: "The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/efl-trophy">EFL Trophy</a> has still been good for us.</p>
      <p>"Playing against the professionals is a tough challenge and it gets you experience.</p>
      <p>"It shows you where you are at.</p>
      <p>"It is a lot more physical and tougher as you are coming up against bigger.</p>
      <p>"You have to be quick on the ball."</p>
      <p>United have tied down Anderson, Kell Watts and Joe White to long deals in the last few weeks as they look to nurture more local talent.</p>
      <p>But Anderson insisted things don't come easy when it comes to getting a professional deal.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was really happy to get my contract, I worked really hard for it.</p>
      <p>"It's good that I can play for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>"I've been at the club since the Under-9 category and came right through the process."</p>

      <p>The North Shields lad now has his sights on bigger things and with fellow Geordies Sean and Matty Longstaff making it all the way to the Premier League stage, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-hand-new-contract-17225984">Anderson</a> hopes to follow them.</p>
      <p>He went on: "It gives you confidence when you see them (the Longstaff brothers) up there.</p>
      <p>"They're midfielders too and it helps you keep trying.</p>
      <p>"One day you always hope to get the chance."</p>
      <p>Anderson's progress has also attracted international interest with Scotland beating England to the chase after former Toon player Kevin Dillon, now a scout for the Scots, spotted him playing in the Newcastle second string.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have played for Scotland Under-18s too, I have been doing well and got the man of the match when I last played for them.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully I can add to that.</p>
      <p>"My grandma is Scottish so that's the link there."</p>
