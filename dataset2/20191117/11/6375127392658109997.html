      <h3>THREE of four notorious drug pushers were arrested while an estimated P1.5 million worth of shabu, weighing 225 grams, was seized in a buy-bust operation before dawn yesterday in Navotas City.</h3>
      <p>Navotas police chief P/Col. Rolando Balasabas identified the arrested suspects as Warly Romay, 36, Edmundo Quijano, 48, both of R. Domingo St. Bgy. Tangos North and Roxanne Jimenez, 36, of Golden City, Taytay, Rizal while their cohort, Romeo Limbaro, 32, also of R. Domingo St. managed to escape and is now the object of police manhunt.</p>
      <p>In his report to Northern Police District (NPD) Director Brig. Gen. Ronaldo Ylagan, Col Balasabas said elements of Station Drug Enforcement Unit (SDEU) led by P/Lt Charlie Bontigao conducted a buy-bust operation against the suspect at around 3:30 a.m. along R. Domingo St. in Bgy. Tangos North after more than a week of surveillance operation.</p>
      <p>Col. Balasabas said that after the deal, operatives who were waiting nearby pounced on the suspects while Limbaro managed to flee.</p>
      <p>When frisked, the suspects yielded a total of 79 pieces of small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets of shabu including the subject of buy-bust, one plastic ice bag containing suspected shabu with a total street value of P1.539,090.90 million, several pieces of drug paraphernalia and P500 marked money.</p>
