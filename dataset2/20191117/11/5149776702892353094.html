      <h1>NHS worker kicked off the bus in the dark and told 'you can't pay extra fare'</h1>
      <h2>She had missed her stop and her Robin Hood card was no longer valid</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:36:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>An NHS worker said she was booted off a bus and had to walk 15 minutes in the dark to get back to the stop she had missed because the driver refused to accept her money.</p>
      <p>Mariama Amoah, 38, from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Hucknall</a>, had just worked overtime at Nottingham's City Hospital and wanted to get home.</p>
      <p>The Hucknall mum said she usually takes the Trent Barton Threes from the hospital grounds to Moor Bridge where she takes a tram back to Hucknall.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">hospital administrator</a> finished work at around 7.30pm on Sunday, November 10.</p>
      <p>She caught the bus, but due to exhaustion, had completely missed her stop at Moor Bridge.</p>
      <p>Mrs Amoah said she has a Robin Hood card that allows her to travel within the city boundary but because she had missed her stop it was no longer valid.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was very tired and missed my usual stop at Moor Bridge. I use this bus twice a day six days a week.</p>
      <p>"The bus stopped and I looked up to see the driver standing in front of me.</p>
      <p>"He asked if I had a Robin Hood card, I answered 'yes.'</p>
      <p>"He then told me to 'get off the bus. You can't go any further.'</p>
      <p>"I said 'it was dark so could I pay to Hucknall please?' He informed me it was company policy to throw people off the bus and not to let them pay.</p>
      <p>"I pointed out how illogical this was as I would have to get on the bus and pay the fee to the next driver. He said he didn't make the rules."</p>
      <p>Mrs Amoah said she felt embarrassed and didn't want to argue in front of other customers.</p>
      <p>"I got off the bus and had no idea where I was," she said.</p>
      <p>"I called my husband and followed the road back until I got my bearings.</p>

      <p>"It was cold and dark. There was no reason to kick me off. I was prepared to pay.</p>
      <p>"He kicked a woman off the bus in the dark. I am a 5ft 2 woman on my own. I did not want to do that.</p>
      <p>"If something had come of this then questions would have been asked. What happens if it had been a teenage girl?"</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">Trent Barton</a> said an investigation has been launched to determine what happened.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the company said: "We were sorry to hear about this customer's complaint and have been in touch with her so we can carry out a full investigation over the coming days.</p>
      <p>"We will be back in contact with her to let her know the outcome of the investigation."</p>
