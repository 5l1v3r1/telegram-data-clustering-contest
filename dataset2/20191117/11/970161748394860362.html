      <h3>Who’s in War of the Worlds?</h3>
      <p>The BBC’s adaptation will be a more faithful adaption of the novel, taking place in Britain at the turn of the twentieth century, unlike the modern-day setting of 2005’s movie with Tom Cruise.</p>

      <p>Keeping the authenticity of the original tale was important to the Beeb.</p>
