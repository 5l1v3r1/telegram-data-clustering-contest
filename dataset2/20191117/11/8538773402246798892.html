      <h1>Manager sacked after 27-0 win as club president left fuming at a lack of respect</h1>

      <p>A youth coach in Italy was sacked after his side won 27-0 on Saturday as the president of the club criticised him for disrespecting the team's opponents.</p>
      <p>Under-18 side Invictasauro, based in the Grosseto region of Tuscany, faced Marina Calcio and racked up the huge scoreline, only for coach Massimiliano Riccini to lose his job afterwards.</p>
      <p>Tiberio Pratesi, the sporting director of bottom side Marina Calcio, complained after the match that league leaders Invictasauro had disrespected his side. Marina Calcio suffered from a string of injury problems and had to field an outfield player in goal for the match, which featured two Invictasauro players scoring six goals each, and one netting seven.</p>
      <p>Pratesi received a phone call from a representative of Invictasauro after the match in which the club apologised for the result.</p>
      <p>Paolo Brogelli, the president of Invictasauro, released a statement and said the junior team decided to part ways with coach Riccini.</p>
      <p>"We were stunned and deeply regretful when hearing that our <i>Juniores </i>team had beaten Marina Calcio 27-0," <a href="https://www.grossetosport.com/16-11-2019/linvictasauro-fa-27-reti-in-una-partita-ed-il-presidente-paolo-brogelli-esonera-il-tecnico-i-nostri-tecnici-hanno-il-compito-di-educare-i-ragazzi/153074/?fbclid=IwAR1vbbVzre72r_WYMDyamxkOEgZo8UUV57DqVf-usKPcbQoTqwNi0wL5UnE">President Brogelli said in a statement.</a></p>
      <p>"The values of youth team football are antithetical to such a thing. The opponent must always be respected and that did not happen today.</p>
      <p>"As president, I sincerely apologise to the Marina club. I announce that our directors decided, unanimously, to sack coach Riccini.</p>
      <p>"Our coaches have the duty to train young players, but above all to educate them. That did not happen today."</p>
