      <h1>Turkish deaf athlete wins 3 karate world titles in 3 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:50:32+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author">DAILY SABAH WITH DHA</a></address>
      <p>After winning multiple local and world titles with the Turkish national Deaf Karate Team, Melek Özkaya, a national athlete with innate hearing impairment of some 71%, is now eyeing Olympic success.</p>
      <p>Özkaya lives in northwestern Turkey's Kocaeli province. She was born in a deaf family like herself and learned to speak with special education. Özkaya was interested in volleyball before she started a career in karate four years ago on the advice of a friend.</p>
      <p>She was chosen for the national team in 2016 after becoming third in the Turkish deaf championships. During the same year, the national athlete won gold in the world championships.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old athlete told the Demirören News Agency (DHA) that she intends to participate in the Hearing Impaired Olympic Games in 2021. "It's my dream to win Olympic gold. I want to win more championships and gold medals in karate," she added.</p>
      <p>Winning several other championships across the competitions held in Turkey, Özkaya also inspired her hearing-impaired husband to take up karate, who unfortunately later gave up.</p>
      <p>Özkaya is currently preparing for the World Karate Championship for the Hearing Impaired which is to be held in Malaysia next year.</p>
