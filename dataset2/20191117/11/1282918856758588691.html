      <p>Former South African speedster Dale Steyn called India's Mohammed Shami as the 'best bowler in current form' as India registered a comprehensive win over Bangladesh in the first Test at Indore. Shami has been on a spectacular un for India in Tests and is considered as the deadliest fourth innings bowler. Dale Steyn revealed his choice of the best bowler to a fan during a Q&amp;A session with his fans on Twitter. The former South African speedster also had a few words of praise for young Naseem Shah and said that he had 'some wheels'. </p>

      <h3>Shami achieves a new feat</h3>
      <p>In the first Test against Bangladesh where India had registered a comprehensive win, Mohammed Shami once again proved why he is the best bowler in the second innings as he has now become the most successful bowler in the last two years when it comes to bowling in the second innings. The star pacer now has 51 scalps from 20 innings. Only the likes of Australia's Pat Cummins (48) and Nathan Lyon (47) are near Shami. Mohammed Shami took seven wickets in the first Test match. He finished with figures of 3/27 in the first innings at an economy rate of 2.08 including five maidens whereas, in the second innings, he was yet again the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of 4/31 at an economy rate of 1.94 including seven maidens.</p>

      <h3>India register a comprehensive win</h3>
      <p>India declared their innings on the morning of Day 3 at 493/6 with a mammoth lead of 343 runs. The bowlers once again struck early for the hosts as Bangladesh lost their top order pretty early. Only Mushfiqur Rahim, Liton Das, Mehidy Hasan managed to show some resistance for the visitors. Rahim top-scored for Bangladesh with a 150-ball 64 and once he was dismissed, it was only a matter of time before the Mominul Haque-led side were bundled out for 213 as India won by an innings and 130 runs. By the virtue of this win, Team India continues to remain undisputed in the ICC World Test Championship points table with 300 points in six games that they have played so far and winning on all occasions.</p>
