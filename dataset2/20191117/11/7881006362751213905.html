      <p><b>Mumbai</b>: Amid worsening ties with all-weather ally Shiv Sena, Maharashtra caretaker chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis praised Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray and called him a source of inspiration.</p>
      <p>Sharing a video of a speech by Thackeray on Twitter, Fadnavis wrote he taught people the value of ''self-respect''.  “Hundreds of salutations to Hindu Hriday Samrat Bal Thackeray on his death anniversary,” Fadnavis tweeted in Marathi.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Shiv Sena skipped a meeting of NDA constituents on the eve of the winter session of Parliament.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena- BJP alliance strained after they failed to agree to a power-sharing deal to form a government in the state.</p>
      <p>After the pre-poll alliance fell, Sena is now trying to stitch an alliance with ideological rivals, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress to form a government.</p>
      <p>The three parties have been holding talks over the past weeks trying to chalk out a common minimum programme (CMP).</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut of the Sena said all the parties have reached a consensus on the CMP. NCP's chief Pawar has also shown optimism over party formation, saying that the alliance will soon give a strong and stable government to Maharashtra and it will complete its five-year term.</p>
      <p>A meeting with Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi was scheduled for Sunday but got postponed. It is likely to happen on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Pawar will hold a meeting with his party's core committee on Sunday to discuss the political scenario in the state. The meet will take place in Pune.</p>
      <p>On October 24, the declared result of Maharashtra Assembly polls announced BJP as the single-largest party, with 105 seats. In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, while Sena secured 56, Congress and NCP won 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>Last week, President's rule was imposed on the recommendation of the Governor BS Koshiyari after not a single party was able to prove numbers for government formation.</p>
