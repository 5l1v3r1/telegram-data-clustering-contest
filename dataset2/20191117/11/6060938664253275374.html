      <h1>Panasonic Open India: Kid Kim soars to win with flurry of birdies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:49:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Moushumi-Bora-17023.cms" target="_blank">Moushumi Bora</a></address>
      <p>MEWAT (Haryana): Golf can be an unforgiving game. One small mistake can punished heavily, and no matter how many times <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Kapur">Shiv Kapur</a> had fallen short, this one will sting for a while. Steady Shiv had done all the right things till the 18th and then his tee shot went out of bounds.</p>
      <p>Having come on to the final hole at the shortened <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Panasonic-Open">Panasonic Open</a> India with a one-stroke advantage, Shiv suddenly found himself staring at an uphill bogey putt to force a playoff. That also was not meant to be. A double sent him tumbling to tied-2nd place with Chikkarangappa, and Kim soaring.</p>
      <p>He probably wasn't a deserving loser. But then, young Joohyung, who is twenty years younger than Shiv at 17, was a deserving winner. The chubby fresh-faced teenager who shot a 7-under 65 for a total 13-under, is now the second youngest <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian-Tour">Asian Tour</a> champion, and that was achieved after a series of near-misses. Golf can be giving too, if you have the patience, because there's always next week.</p>
      <p>"Surreal, huh," said the much-travelled boy after lifting the trophy at the Classic Golf &amp; Country Club. Born in Korea, living in Bangkok, stayed in Australia and Philippines, and now a champion in India.</p>
      <p>"I am just having a lot of kid thoughts right now, all mixed up," said Joohyung, who had been a score boy at the Manila Masters in 2016, when SSP Chawrasia had won.</p>
      <p>His willingness to pose for selfies with the pre-teens stems from his own fanboy moments. Tiger Woods, who had come to Australia for a tournament was "literally standing five feet away" en route the washroom and caught sight of kid Kim who was wearing an oversized Nike cap. "Tiger grabbed it and signed," he said, bursting into wholesome laughter.</p>
      <p>But don't let the innocence fool you.</p>
      <p>Kim had already won three tournaments on the Asian Development Tour (ADT) - the last one in Pakistan - and notched up eight other Top-10 finishes this year before his biggest triumph.</p>
      <p>Last week at the Thailand Open, where Shiv lost in a playoff, Kim was one shot off the lead with two holes to play and missed out. There was a similar story in Indonesia. "Right now there are flashbacks to the hard times. The shoulder blade injury earlier this year had been a trying time. I have also struggled with the last three holes in the last three events."</p>
      <p>On the 16th hole on Sunday, he almost let it slip but a chip-in for a par save kept him rolling in the $400,000 event. "That was probably the shot that gave me the tournament."</p>
      <p>Golf was not his favourite sport when he followed his pro dad to the driving range but a much-loved profession now, and he had a winning cheque for $72,000 to show for it in his rookie year. "My parents have made a lot of sacrifices to get me where I'm today so this is my gift to them."</p>
      <p>It did not come easy, at least on the back nine.</p>
      <p>"I gave myself every chance I could," he recalled, as he was rewarded for his close hitting with seven birdies in ten holes.</p>
      <p>Starting four strokes back in tied-11th place on 6-under, he soared into a two-stroke lead with his birdie blitz but only had a series of pars to show for the last eight holes. He admitted he was feeling the pressure. "I kind of struggled knowing I was in contention. It was really windy today and I scrambled quite well for a bogey-free round. It was not easy to shoot a 65 under these conditions."</p>
      <p>Shiv, on 10-under, started with a bogey on the par-5 third but made amends on the sixth, and consolidated on the 7th, 9th, 11th and 16th to seize the lead going on to the decisive 18th. And then the nightmare unfolded. As Kim watched in expectation, the double bogey sealed Kapur's fate as well as his.</p>

        <b>Fast facts</b>
      </p>
      <p>* Joohyung Kim is the second youngest player to win on the Asian Tour at 17 years and 149 days. Thailand's Chinnarat Phadungsil holds the record as the youngest winner at 17 years, five days when he won the Double A International Open in 2005.</p>
      <p>* Kim recently earned a battlefield promotion from the Asian Development Tour (ADT) to the Asian Tour by winning three ADT events in the same season. He failed to make it through Asian Tour Q-School.</p>
