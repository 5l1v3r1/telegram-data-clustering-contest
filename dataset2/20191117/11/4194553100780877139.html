      <h1>“I always want more” – Firmino vows to win more trophies with Liverpool</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:22:35+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Bobby Firmino is one of the finest forwards in world football at the minute, and the Brazilian has now said that he wants to improve even further.</p>
      <p>He was crucial in our road to Madrid last summer, on the way to our sixth Champions League title, and Bobby also tasted success with his nation – winning the Copa America with Brazil.</p>
      <p>Firmino has certainly come a long way since his early days at Anfield in 2015, under Brendan Rodgers, as he’s morphed from an attacking midfielder into the Premier League’s best false nine.</p>
      <p>But he’s not satisfied with that – Bobby wants to improve himself and he’s desperate to win more silverware at Liverpool, the club he loves.</p>
      <p>“<b>I think I improved a lot in every way: physically, tactically, mentally, I learned a bit of every aspect,</b>” he told Premier League Productions, <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/373143-roberto-firmino-improvement-trophies-liverpool?utm_source=Social&amp;utm_medium=TwitterWebsiteCards&amp;utm_content=Digital&amp;utm_campaign=LFCTwitterCards">via the club’s official website</a>, when asked how he has changed since arriving at Anfield four years ago.</p>
      <p>“<b>But I do not want to stop here. I want to keep improving – I always want more, I have big goals, I want to keep winning titles with this club and that is it.</b>”</p>
      <p>It’s really nice that Bobby makes a point of saying “with this club” – it just shows what’s going on behind his eyes – the man clearly wants to win <i>with </i>us. It’s not about him, he’s just as selfless as he is on the field!</p>
