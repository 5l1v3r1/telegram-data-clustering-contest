      <h1>Chevrolet Tahoe Celebrates 25 Years Of Go-Anywhere Attitude</h1>
      <h2>Happy Birthday to the best-selling full-size SUV in the US.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:35:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>It was in 1995 when Chevrolet launched the shortened version of its <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevrolet-suburban-celebrates-a-significant-milestone">long-running Suburban</a>, the full-size, three-row Tahoe SUV, and it became an immediate hit. Thanks to a number of features, such as the maneuverability of a short-wheelbase truck only with four doors, and its body-on-frame construction, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/tahoe">Chevrolet Tahoe</a> has since been the go-to choice for millions. Whether it's a family road trip with a boat in tow, off-road adventure, or an endless list of other tasks, the Tahoe has been up for the challenge. It has been the best-selling full-size SUV in the US for the last 19 years. And now it is celebrating its 25th anniversary.</p>
      <p>"The Tahoe delivered the perfect blend of capability, cargo space and comfort just as the four-door, full-size SUV market ignited in the United States," said Paul Edwards, US vice president of Chevrolet marketing.</p>

      <p>Aside from receiving numerous awards for reliability from the likes of J.D. Power and Associates, its general sales remain very strong. In fact, nearly one in four full-size SUVs sold in the US right now are Tahoes. When combined with its long-wheelbase <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/suburban">Chevy Suburban</a> sibling, the pair account for 45 percent of the full-size SUV segment.</p>
      <p>Over the past two and a half decades, the Tahoe has also seen duty in law enforcement with the Tahoe PPV. Like other police-prepped vehicles, this one comes with a beefier suspension, a high output alternator, and the must-have computers, lights, and sirens. Police have loved the Tahoe since the day it arrived.</p>

      <p>With standard V8 power and available four-wheel-drive, the Tahoe also offers plenty of luxury, such as leather upholstery, tri-zone climate control, a six-speaker sound system, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A redesigned Tahoe, alongside a new Suburban, is set to arrive in the very near future. It can also two up to 8,600 pounds when properly equipped and seat up to nine. Prices start from $49,000.</p>
