      <h1>Motorist nearly kills Manila traffic enforcer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:46:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/itchie-g-cabayan" target="_blank">Itchie G. Cabayan</a></address>
      <h3>MANILA Mayor Isko Moreno has ordered the filing of appropriate charges against a motorist who nearly killed and dragged a traffic enforcer while the latter hung in his car window as he sped off after being accosted for a traffic violation.</h3>
      <p>Moreno is also seeking that the suspect’s driver’s license be revoked.</p>
      <p>Moreno also warned motorists traversing in the streets of Manila to follow  traffic rules and respect the enforcers whether from the Philippine National Police or the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau.</p>
      <p>In light of what happened to MTPB enforcer Mc Adrian Lim, 21, the mayor said that the traffic enforcers work rain or shine and bear the scorching heat everyday just to maintain orderliness in the streets and roads.</p>
      <p>‘Mahirap and trabaho ng mga traffic enforcers.  Hindi biro ang panganib na kinakaharap nila sa araw-araw na nasa gitna sila ng kalsada.Bukod pa sa ulan, tirik na araw at galit ng mga nahuhuling lumalabag sa batas trapiko kaya pakitaan naman natin sila ng respeto,’ a visibly disappointed Moreno said.</p>
      <p>The mayor noted that in the case at hand, it was bad enough that the driver, identified as Orlando Ricardo Dizon Jr., 54, of No. 47 Gonzales Drive, Dona Pilar Compound, Batasan Hills, Quezon City, sped away when accosted.  He made matters worse by not stopping and opting to drive away even while the MTPB held on to the door on the driver’s side.</p>
      <p>It was learned from MTPB chief Dennis Viaje that the incident began at around 9:45 a.m. when Lim accosted Dizon along Gelinos Street near corner Laong-Laan Street in  Sta. Cruz, Manila for ‘disregarding lane markings.’</p>
      <p>Viaje said the suspect was cruising along the left side of the street meant for those who are going to take a left turn when he went straight ahead.  The penalty, he said, was a measly P500.</p>
      <p>Viaje said that while being issued a ticket, Dizon sped off and on instinct, Lim held on to the car door. Dizon then tried to get him off by accelerating speed and zigzagging his vehicle.  It was learned that the suspect hit another car in the process. Viaje said that when Lim was able to get off safely, the suspect continued speeding off and got arrested near the corner of Oroquieta  and Tayuman Streets in Sta. Cruz.</p>
      <p>Lim sustained wounds as a result of the incident and was discharged from the hospital after undergoing checks.</p>
      <p>Moreno personally went to the police station to admonish the suspect and then called on motorists not to disregard traffic rules in Manila.</p>
