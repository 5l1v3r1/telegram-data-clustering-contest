      <h1>Everton defender Mason Holgate on his training ground improvements, Silva and gym work with Walcott</h1>
      <h2>Holgate has started Everton's last four matches</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:33:34+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/phil-kirkbride/" target="_blank">Phil Kirkbride</a></address>
      <p>Mason Holgate says he used to be "unbelievable in one session" and then anonymous the next at Everton.</p>
      <p>But the 23-year-old's consistency in training at Finch Farm has now improved and helped him force his way into Marco Silva's thinking.</p>
      <p>And Holgate says he now has the build to be a central defender in the Premier League and spends time doing extra gym work away from the club with Theo Walcott.</p>
      <p>Holgate has started the last four games in all competitions for the Blues and even though he got his chance at Brighton due to injury, he has stayed in the team on merit.</p>
      <p>“The main thing [which improved] was my consistency,” said Holgate.</p>
      <p>“Before, I would be unbelievable in one session, then the next one I might as well have not been there.</p>
      <p>“Now there is a consistent base. Some sessions will always be better than others but there is a minimum level.</p>
      <p>“And my physicality has improved.”</p>

      <p>Asked about doing extra strength and conditioning work, the young defender added: “I’m in there pretty much every day.</p>
      <p>“Theo Walcott goes to a gym near me and I have joined the same one. I see him in there all the time.</p>
      <p>“That work is reflected in my physique and how I am playing.</p>
      <p>“I don’t get thrown about and can compete more than ever.”</p>
      <p>Silva admits he has been demanding on Holgate but the centre-half says the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> manager's work on the training ground is paying off.</p>
      <p>“He is a great coach and has helped me a lot,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Last year, my concentration and focus were not as good. He had to keep drilling things home.</p>
      <p>“Now, you will have to ask him [if I am right], but I think I take things on a lot more. That helps massively with him.</p>
      <p>“Everything he tries to put across I understand, so I don’t think he has to speak to me as much now.</p>
      <p>“I know my job and what I am doing. I think he has noticed that as well.”</p>
