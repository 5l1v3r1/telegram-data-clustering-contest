      <h2>The animal-lover has been praised for the ingenious makeover which saw her turn the white box room into a doggy haven full of treats and toys for the pampered Birmingham dog</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T11:42:06+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A woman has turned an empty under the stairs cupboard into an adorable bedroom for her Labrador.</p>
      <p>The animal-lover from Birmingham has been branded the "best human ever" after she shared photos of the transformation on a DIY <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group.</p>
      <p>The doggy haven comes complete with personalised bunting bearing the name Luther - and plenty of blankets, as well as a bed to keep him snug.</p>
      <p>What was once a bare box room with grey carpet and white walls has been given a modern revamp with marble-style tiles.</p>
      <p>The walls have decorated using a combination of pale green tiles and wallpaper, while a number of shelves house Luther's treats.</p>

      <p>The thrifty decorator captioned the post: "Wasn’t using my under stairs cupboard so made my Labrador a bedroom."</p>
      <p>One person replied: "This is a great idea."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Absolutely LOVE. Your pet is treated better than some people probably has a nicer pad too! Fantastic." </p>
      <p>One social media user quipped it was "better than Harry Potter’s under stair bedroom".</p>
      <p>Another gushed: "This is the cutest thing! You are the best human.'</p>

      <p>Meanwhile as we <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mum-transforms-space-under-stairs-20880356">previously reported</a> , a mum transformed the space under the stairs in her home into a brilliant sensory room for her son using bargain buys from Poundland and Amazon.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Ashleigh Dunkley cleared out the large cupboard under the stairs used to store junk and turned it into a haven for her three-year-old son CJ complete with LED lights, foam walls, a ball pit and cogs.</p>
      <p>Ashleigh saw the positive impact a weekly visit to a sensory room at CJ's developmental nursery was having and started thinking about her own space under the stairs.</p>
      <p>Over one weekend the mum set about creating a room designed to help her son develop his senses using light, music and touch.</p>
