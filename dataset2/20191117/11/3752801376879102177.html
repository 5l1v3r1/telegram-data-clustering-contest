      <p>Birthday wishes have been pouring in for President Cyril Ramaphosa, who turned 67 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He returned to the country earlier this week after a working visit to Brasilia in the Federative Republic of Brazil, where he participated in the 11th Brics Summit.</p>
      <p>Last year, Ramaphosa celebrated his birthday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, while attending the African Union Summit.</p>
      <p>The ruling party, politicians and citizens alike wished him well, including Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul and Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula.</p>
      <p>ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said Ramaphosa remained an inspiration to citizens and members of the party for his commitment to the liberation struggle and the rebuilding of the country.</p>
      <p>"As President of the Republic, he has contributed enormously toward restoring the integrity, credibility and legitimacy of our state institutions," he said.</p>
      <p>"A unifying leader, President Ramaphosa and his collective continue to serve as a glue that holds the organisation together... We wish our President a happy birthday."</p>
