      <h3>Tomato &amp; Thyme Eggs With Garlic Sourdough &amp; Herb-Dressed Leaves</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Serves 2</i>
      </p>
      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, 2 thinly sliced, 1 peeled and left whole</li>
        <li>400 grams cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>Small bag of baby spinach (80 grams)</li>
        <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
        <li>2 slices of sourdough</li>
        <li>Sea salt and black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the salad:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp. white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Pinch of caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ butterhead lettuce, leaves washed</li>
        <li>Handful of parsley, leaves picked</li>
        <li>Handful or coriander, leaves picked</li>
        <li>Handful of dill, leaves picked</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Method:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the sliced garlic, and cook over medium-high heat for 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes, thyme, and seasoning and cook over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes; they should soften and release their juices but not completely break down.</li>
        <li>Add the baby spinach and allow to wilt into the tomatoes. Make 2 hollows in the mixture and crack an egg into each. Cover with a lid and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk the vinegar and sugar together in a medium bowl with some salt and pepper, then gradually whisk in the oil to form a dressing. Add the salad leaves and herbs and toss well.</li>
        <li>Toast the sourdough slices, then rub each one with the whole garlic clove and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Place them on 2 plates and top with the tomato and thyme eggs. Serve with the herby salad.</li>
      </ol>
