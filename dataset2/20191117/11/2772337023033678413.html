      <p>But according to the man himself, his wife is ‘no doormat’ and actually messaged Gabby to ask if she had slept with her husband.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline has sent a few messages to women I’ve been accused of cheating with — I think any partner would do that — asking what had happened between us,’ Dan told <i>The Sun Online</i>.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve told her I haven’t cheated on her, that I’ve just been out with those girls, they’re mates and that’s it.</p>
      <p>‘I’m a friendly person so I’ll go out and speak to people I get on with, male or female. That’s just what I’m like.’</p>
      <p>Dan continued: ‘But I get pictured with a woman and suddenly we’re getting cosy.</p>
      <p>‘With Gabby, I know the pictures didn’t look great because of the angle they were taken at, but there was nothing in it.</p>

      <p>‘And if Jacqueline really believed I had cheated on her, she wouldn’t be with me now because she wouldn’t stand for any crap, honestly.</p>
      <p>‘She’s no doormat. She’s a very strong woman.’</p>
      <p>Gabby, who was shocked by the allegations, also reassured the mum of two nothing had happened between her and the former Towie star.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline is starring in this year’s <a href="https://www.celebsnow.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity"><b>I’m A Celebrity</b></a>, alongside Gabby’s ex-boyfriend Myles Stephenson.</p>
      <p>Gabby’s own romance with Myles came to a crashing end amid accusations he had sent flirty messages to other women behind her back.</p>
      <p>She confirmed the news, writing on Instagram: ‘The newspaper articles are true. I am no longer in a relationship. I hope youse have all had a better week than me!’</p>
      <p>Let’s hope talk between Jacqueline and Myles doesn’t turn to their love lives…</p>
