      <p>The former US Secretary of State reportedly said of Markle — who’s spoken publicly of her struggles in the spotlight — “I feel as a mother I just want to put my arms around her.”</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail reported a source saying, “Both women have a lot of admiration for each other and it was a very sweet, warm meeting.”</p>

      <p>Apparently Mrs Clinton also met the royal couple’s baby, Archie.</p>
      <p>The source added, “They are mutual fan girls!”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, royal watchers have suggested that Meghan could be gearing up for a role on the international advocacy stage if she and Harry decide to move to the US.</p>
      <p>Meghan, who was born in Los Angeles, will reportedly spend the November 28 holiday with Harry, Archie, and her mother, Doria Ragland, and wants her six-month-old son to grow up aware of his American heritage.</p>
      <p>It was thought they would return to the UK and spend Christmas with the royals at Sandringham, but The Sun reported last week that they are going to stay in the US for the Christmas break.</p>
      <p>A palace spokesman said: “Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess’ mother Doria Ragland.</p>
      <p>“This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen.”</p>
