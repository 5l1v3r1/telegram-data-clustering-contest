        <b>An ambitious campaign by locals to rid Preston Dock of its long-standing blue-green algae problem and boost the waterside community is now “all systems go.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>A volunteer group called CLEARED (Community Led Action to Revitalise the Dock) has been launched after around 40 people attended a meeting to gauge public interest in the clean-up initiative.</p>
      <p>Spearheaded by three residents - all with vast scientific expertise - the project is now underway to raise funds to tackle the issue which has plagued the dock basin and marina for years.</p>
      <p>UCLan Professor Ted Smith, one of those leading the campaign, said: “The positivity of everyone at the meeting and the willingness of people to offer their time and skills has convinced us we can turn our plans into reality.”</p>
      <p>Water scientist Dave Crawhaw revealed the next phase of the project will involve the group obtaining charitable status in readiness for a fundraising campaign.</p>
      <p>And the third member of the team, Dave Smith, a water engineer and a man with a plan for building aerators and floating islands for the project, estimated that around £30,000 will be needed for phase 1 to be completed.</p>
      <p>The trio called the meeting to assess how much support their initiative would have from the local community. And 24 volunteered their services to get the plan off the ground.</p>
      <p>Blue-green algae has been a problem since the docks closed to shipping back in 1981. A lack of water movement has encourage algae growth which, in turn, has discouraged water sports enthusiasts to use of the dock basin.</p>
      <p>A study carried out in 2007 said clearing the problem could cost up to £1.3m. But the group believe it can be done much cheaper.</p>
