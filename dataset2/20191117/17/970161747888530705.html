      <p>Roy Keane has delivered a damning verdict on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> transfer target Declan Rice.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> and England midfielder Rice has emerged as a target for the Red Devils, who are reportedly eyeing a stunning £80m move ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>United spent almost £150m on new signings last summer but failed to bolster <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s midfield options despite the departures of Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera.</p>

      <p>Rice could find himself heading to Old Trafford in the next year but Red Devils hero Keane has revealed his concerns over the West Ham man.</p>

      <p>Speaking ahead of England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Kosovo on Sunday, Keane told ITV: ‘Well, where he [Rice] needs to improve, there’s plenty of aspects.</p>
      <p>‘When you think about him, over the last few months he’s had a lot of praise. I’ve looked at him pretty closely, I’ve worked with him when he was with the Irish squad.</p>
      <p>‘Where he needs to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play, I don’t think he’s been consistent enough, he doesn’t stay with runners, he’s sloppy in possession, I can go on.</p>
      <p>‘He’s one of these players who people were enjoying and loved but he’s one of these players that has almost played his way out of the team because he’s not been consistent at West Ham.</p>
      <p>‘He’s got another opportunity tonight and I think it is a position in the England team where Gareth [Southgate] is obviously not sure who’s going to do that job in there.</p>

      <p>Despite signing Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James last summer, Manchester United are just seventh in the Premier League after 12 fixtures.</p>
