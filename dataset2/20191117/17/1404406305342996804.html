      <p>Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg recently spoke in front of a crowd of Black and Latino people and gave some insight into the stop and frisk methods he pushed during his time in office.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg said, “Over time, I’ve come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself: I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn’t understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know: Good intentions aren’t good enough." For those unaware, Bloomberg may allegedly be making a run for president in 2020. Watch above.</p>
