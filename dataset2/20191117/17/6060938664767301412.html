      <h1>DDCA ombudsman declines president Rajat Sharma's resignation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:31:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Arani-Basu-479217570.cms" target="_blank">Arani Basu</a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi and District Cricket Association (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/DDCA">DDCA</a>) president <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajat-Sharma">Rajat Sharma</a> and the executives tendered their resignations, the state association's ombudsman Justice <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badar-Durrez-Ahmed">Badar Durrez Ahmed</a> has ordered that these resignations should be kept in abeyance and Sharma and his team should continue to discharge their duties.</p>
      <p>The ombudsman came to his decision after receiving three complaints from members. "The common thread running through the complaints is that a very serious and anarchic situation prevails in the administration of the affairs of DDCA. This has allegedly been caused by disruptive actions by some members of the apex council which purportedly led to the President, CEO, CFO and GM, Cricketing Operations tendering their resignations," the ombudsman's circular read.</p>
      <p>According to Ahmed's circular, one purported resolution seeks to reinstate <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vinod-Tihara">Vinod Tihara</a> as the secretary who was suspended on 2.11.2019 by the Apex Council and in respect of which a reference was made to the Ombudsman. The second purported resolution sought to terminate the services of the CEO. The third purported resolution sought to withdraw the powers which were accorded to the president on July 2.</p>
      <p>"In order that the interest of the game of cricket and its administration by DDCA is not jeopardised, I stay the operation of the said three purported resolutions and direct the maintenance of status quo ante as existing on 12.11.2019. The resignations mentioned above shall be kept in abeyance. All these persons who had tendered their resignations shall continue to discharge their duties in the interest of the game of cricket," the circular mentioned.</p>
