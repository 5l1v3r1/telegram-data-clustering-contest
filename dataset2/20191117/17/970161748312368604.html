      <p>An independent candidate standing to be an MP in the General Election has revealed he is merely a spokesperson for a fluffy white cat.</p>
      <p>Yes, Stan the cat is really feline its chances at beating the Tories and Labour next month with a pledge to stop Brexit and convert the Channel Tunnel into a giant cat flap.</p>
      <p>Anti-Brexit campaigner Peter Cook is running Stan’s campaign in Gillingham and Rainham – a safe Tory seat in Medway, Kent.</p>
      <p>He says Stan and his ‘UCAT party’ represent a ‘real alternative’ for voters fed up with the Brexit Party and Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘UCAT is an alternative that will negotiate a Brexit deal which is kinder on pets and which sticks two paws up to Johnson and the likes of Jacob Rees-Moggy.’</p>

      <p>Mr Cook says he lived in Medway all his life and believes ‘our towns deserve better’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Brexit will make it more likely that Medway falls into greater levels of deprivation and a sense of hopelessness.</p>
      <p>‘The situation in Medway mirrors much of the UK and we must rid ourselves of Brexit in order to face the real issues that lie behind the Brexit vote in 2016.’</p>
      <p>The political activist said the idea of putting Stan forward was originally it a bit of fun for social media and his Facebook page ‘Cats Against Brexit Mayhem’.</p>

      <p>But he said ‘it’s turned into a real thing’ and he now believes in Stan’s chances.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It’s difficult to engage interest from people on social media on issues like climate change or conflict.</p>
      <p>‘But involve a fluffy animal like a kitty and everyone leaps on board. Cats are much more interesting than economics, war, famine or climate change.’</p>
