      <p>APALACHIN (WBNG) – The Ransom Steele Tavern rocked out on Sunday, getting into the holiday spirit as Music City’s ‘Santa Jam’ took the stage.</p>
      <p>Local bands and musicians were invited to perform in front of attendees. The jam was to raise money for the Broome County Toys and Tots program that helps spread joy during the Christmas and holiday seasons.</p>
      <p>Event organizer Benny Fiaco from Music City simply putting others first.</p>
      <p>“This means a lot to me personally,” Fiaco said. “I’ve always liked Christmas ever since I was a little kid, and I like to see other kids who are less fortunate be able to enjoy Christmas.</p>
      <p>Fiaco thanking his team and those who came out for the jam.</p>
      <p>“The community has come together to help us make this happen,” Fiaco said.</p>
      <p>Fiaco said this year’s event had seen a jump in attendance than in years past, something he hopes will lead to more donations.</p>
