      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/claudia-winkleman/">Claudia Winkleman</a> may be one of the leading ladies of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> – but don’t expect her to actually hit the dancefloor anytime soon.</p>
      <p>The presenter has ruled out ever taking part on the series because she doesn’t think she has the rhythm to get far in the competition.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Daily Star, she said: ‘Me dancing on Strictly? That will never happen! I am 47. Never. Watch me. I don’t move. I am always lying down.’</p>
      <p>‘I used to dance with Len Goodman when I presented It Takes Two,’ she continued. ‘But I am not sure that would be translated as busting a few moves.</p>
      <p>‘I was standing there going, “What… Where?”.’</p>
      <p>So we guess for now the star is more than happy in her Clauditorium and intends to stay there for the foreseeable.</p>
      <p>Alongside Tess Daly, Claudia has been hosting the Saturday primetime favourite since 2014, taking over full-time from legend Bruce Forsyth.</p>

      <p>The pair have formed a tight bond and have promised that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/16/claudia-winkleman-tess-daly-pact-quit-strictly-come-dancing-together-8253938/">they’ll only ever leave the show together</a>, after becoming known as a unit.</p>

      <p>Just recently, her co-host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/04/strictly-come-dancings-tess-daly-reveals-covers-wardrobe-malfunctions-contingency-8208819/">Tess opened up about her time on the show, and revealed some back stage secrets</a> to Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>Despite presenting more than 200 shows, the 49-year-old revealed she still has a contingency plan in place for if things were to go wrong.</p>
      <p>This week, she joined the class of 2019 as they performed at the iconic Blackpool ballroom – offering them moral support and debrief interviews after each dance.</p>
      <p>Now they only have 7 couples left in the competition and the heat is being turned up as they edge closer to the finale.</p>
