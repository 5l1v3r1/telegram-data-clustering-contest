      <h2>Farmers protested on Saturday over compensation issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:30:41+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/PRESS-TRUST-OF-INDIA-6101/" target="_blank">PRESS TRUST OF INDIA</a></address>
      <p>Plastic pipes and vehicles outside a State infrastructure agency godown here were set ablaze on Sunday, a day after farmers clashed with police demanding adequate compensation for their land that was acquired for an upcoming township by the agency.</p>
      <p>The incident took place around 11 a.m. outside the godown of the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) which acquired the land for the Trans-Ganga City project near Kanpur, officials said.</p>
      <p>“Some anti-social elements had set fire to plastic pipes kept outside the godown. Apart from this, two vehicles were also set afire,” Additional District Magistrate Rakesh Singh said.</p>
      <p>“No farmer has so far claimed responsibility for Sunday’s act, which means that the work has been done by anti-social elements,” District Magistrate Devendra Kumar Pandey said.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, farmers demanding better compensation for their land clashed with the police when government officials visited the project site to clear the encroachment.</p>
      <p>Several farmers were injured as the police baton-charged them, used tear gas and water cannons. Many police personnel were also injured as the protesters targeted them with stones.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Kisan Manch, a forum working for welfare of farmers, claimed that the growers were not indulging in violent protests and were only demanding adequate compensation for their land.</p>
      <p>“Nearly 30% of the farmers of the clash-hit area are yet to get compensation from the government,” RKM president Shekhar Dixit said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The district magistrate, however, had said on Saturday that the farmers were adequately compensated.</p>
      <h3>Priyanka tweet</h3>
      <p>Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra shared a 22-second-long video of the clash on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“UP Chief Minister is making big speeches in Gorakhpur, but see the condition of his police. A farmer in Unnao is lying semi-conscious after being beaten by laathi (stick). He is still being beaten up. There should be some shame. A person who grows grains for you is subjected to such cruelty,” she tweeted.</p>
