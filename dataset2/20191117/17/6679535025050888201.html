      <h1>Ronaldo moves onto 99 as Portugal qualify for Euro 2020</h1>
      <h2>Ronaldo is one short of joining Iran's Ali Daei, the only player to have scored a century of goals for a national team.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:42:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal as the defending champions edged past Luxembourg 2-0 in difficult conditions away from home on Sunday to qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes broke the deadlock in the 39th minute and Ronaldo wrapped it up with four minutes left to ensure that Portugal finished second in Group B with 17 points, three ahead of Serbia who drew 2-2 with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Diogo Jota's shot appeared to be going in any way but Ronaldo prodded it over to claim the goal.</p>
      <p>He is one short of joining Iran's Ali Daei, the only player to have scored a century of goals for a national team.</p>
      <p>“I would have been very proud to have scored my first goal for the national team, but the important thing is we won,” said Jota. “It doesn't matter who scores — we are in the Euros and that is what we wanted.”</p>
      <p>Portugal survived several early scares as they struggled to impose their game on a rain-soaked pitch full of divots at the Josy Barthel stadium.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, in particular, was not enjoying the conditions and gestured angrily at the pitch after sending a speculative wide in the first half.</p>
      <p>Needing a win to qualify without having to worry about Serbia's result, Portugal were in trouble early on as Luxembourg saw a chance to spring an upset.</p>
      <p>Maurice Deville got above his marker and headed over from Laurent Jans' cross and Vincent Thill, a thorn in Portugal's side, had a goalbound shot blocked by Ruben Dias.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg were even closer when a corner found Gerons Rodrigues unmarked but he headed over.</p>
      <p>Portugal began to adapt to the conditions and their more direct approach was rewarded with a goal.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva floated a pass over the Luxembourg defence from deep inside his own half and into the path of Fernandes who took it superbly in his stride and fired a low shot between Anthony Moris and the near post.</p>
      <p>The second half was more comfortable for Portugal as they dominated possession although there still anxious moments.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo nearly sealed it when he curled a free kick narrowly wide from the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>With four minutes left, Silva's cross found Jota and Moris got a hand to it but could not stop it crossing the line and Ronaldo poked it home for good measure.</p>
      <p>“We won't be favourites but we are going there to win,” said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, whose side also won the inaugural Nations League this year.</p>
      <p>“We are not the prettiest team but we have won two European tournaments in the last four years.”</p>
