      <p>Nominations closed Saturday at midnight for the seven graded stakes scheduled over the final four days of the Del Mar meeting, Nov. 28-Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>And while nomination is no guarantee of participation, the number of names on the list, among them a goodly number from trainers based in the East, portends fields of size and quality in events that range from Grade 3 to Grade 1 with purses from $100,000-$300,000.</p>
      <p>A sneak peak in order of appearance.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 3, $100,000 Red Carpet Stakes, Thursday (Thanksgiving), Nov. 28: </b>The 1 3/8-mile turf marathon has 21 nominees. Among them are Phil D’Amato-trained Storm the Hill, second in the Yellow Ribbon here during the summer meeting and notable shippers Theodora B. for Michael Dickinson and Si Que Es Buena for H. Graham Motion. The latter two come off preps at Woodbine with the best result being a third for Theodora B in the Grade Maple Leaf (G3) on Nov. 2.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 2, $200,000 Hollywood Turf Cup, Friday, Nov. 29:</b> The 1 ½-mile stamina tester on turf attracted 20 nominations. Seven are from the East with the most intriguing being Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Stakes (G1) winner <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Arklow_1"><b>Arklow</b></a> for Brad Cox. Arklow was eighth behind Bricks and Mortar in the $4 million Breeders’ Cup Turf. Richard Mandella-trained United, also nominated to this race, was the runner-in the BC Turf.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 3, $100,000 Jimmy Durante, Saturday, November 30:</b> The turf mile for 2-year-old fillies has nominees from top Northern American trainer Chad Brown (Princesa Caroline) and four of his Eastern colleagues. Among them is Michael Stidham, who won the race last year with Elsa and could try for a second with Alms. Leonard Powell-trained Guitty, a French import who won impressively here on Nov. 9, is one of the major local hopes.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 2, $200,000 Seabiscuit Handicap, Saturday, Nov. 30:</b> Among the potential invaders on the list of 19 nominees are Mark Casse’s Curlin’s Honor, Christophe Clement’s Gucci Factor and Brown’s Sacred Life. Curlin’s Honor and Sacred Life are graded stakes placed while New York-bred Gucci Factor has a Grade 3 win in the Poker at Aqueduct last June.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 1, $300,000 Hollywood Derby, Saturday, Nov. 30:</b> The 1 1/8-mile turf test for 3-year-olds has been won by Brown twice in the five previous runnings and Brown appears serious in seeking a third. Aiming to go back-to-back after the success of Raging Bull in 2018, Brown has nominated <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Valid_Point"><b>Valid Point</b></a>, winner of the Secretariat (G1) on Arlington Million Day; Digital Age, winner of the American Turf (G1) on Kentucky Derby Day at Churchill Downs, and Standard Deviation, third in the Hill Prince (G2) on Oct. 5 at Belmont Park.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 3, $100,000 Cecil B. DeMille, Sunday, Dec. 1:</b> Stidham has nominated three, among them unbeaten (2-for-2) Albert Park for the world power Godolphin Stable.</p>
      <p><b>Grade 1, $300,000 Matriarch, Sunday, Dec. 1:</b> The co-signature event, with the Hollywood Derby, of the meeting, run at a mile on turf for older fillies and mares, has 16 nominees. The headliner from the east is Casse-trained <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Got_Stormy"><b>Got Stormy</b></a>, runner-up to Uni, last year’s Matriarch winner, in the $2 million Breeders’ Cup Mile. Also listed are Juliet Foxtrot, runner-up in the John C. Mabee here and the First Lady at Keeneland for Cox; Daddy Is A Legend, second in the 2018 Matriarch with an October prep at Keeneland under her belt; Significant Form, a winner of Grade 2 and Grade 3 events in New York for Brown; and Starship Jubilee, winner of the E.P. Taylor Stakes (G1) at Woodbine last month for Kevin Attard. All shippers will have to deal with Neil Drysdale-trained Toinette, who comes in razor sharp with four wins in her last four starts, the most recent being the Goldikova at Santa Anita on Nov. 3.</p>
