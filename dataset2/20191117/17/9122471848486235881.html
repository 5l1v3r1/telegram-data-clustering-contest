      <h1>3 Head Coaches On The “Hot Seat” After Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:34:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>There’s only a couple of weeks left in the college football regular season. We’ve already seen three Power 5 coaches get fired, with more changes coming.</p>
      <p>Rutgers fired Chris Ash in late September, while Florida State dismissed Willie Taggart earlier this month and Arkansas canned Chad Morris last weekend. Morris made <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/3-major-coaches-on-the-hot-seat-after-week-11">our most recent list</a> of “Coaches on the Hot Seat” prior to being removed from his post.</p>
      <p>With that out of the way, let’s take a look at which coaches are still sweating after Week 12.</p>
      <h3>Michigan State head coach Mark Dantonio</h3>
      <p>Dantonio’s Spartans were demolished by rival Michigan yesterday, losing 44-10 in Ann Arbor. Michigan State is now 4-6 on the season and must win its last two games to become bowl eligible.</p>
      <p>If it were up to many MSU fans, Dantonio would be gone after the season. But his situation is more complicated, as Spartan Nation’s Hondo Carpenter detailed yesterday.</p>

      <p>Maybe Beekman won’t “fire” Dantonio, but could the longtime head coach be forced to make massive staff changes? Or might Dantonio retire following the season?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
      <h3>USC head coach Clay Helton</h3>
      <p>Helton honestly hasn’t turned in a bad season. The Trojans blew out Cal yesterday to move to 7-4 heading into next weekend’s regular season finale against UCLA.</p>
      <p>USC has a new AD in Cincinnati’s Mike Bohn, which puts Helton under further scrutiny. The Urban Meyer-to-USC rumors have been flying since before the season, and Bohn has a connection with the former Ohio State head coach.</p>

      <p>Our gut says Helton will ultimately be let go, but kudos to him for putting together a solid campaign under duress.</p>
      <h3>Vanderbilt head coach Derek Mason</h3>
      <p>Mason has never had a winning season at Vanderbilt, though he has taken the Commodores to a pair of bowl games in 2016 and 2018. Vandy lost both of those games to finish 6-7 those two seasons.</p>
      <p>This year, Mason’s team is 2-8. Even though he signed<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/college/vanderbilt/2019/02/22/vanderbilt-football-coach-derek-mason-contract-extension/2949426002/"> a contract extension</a> in February, he could find himself out at the end of the month.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mason has beaten Tennessee four of six times and three times in a row, which is no small feat. He’ll have a chance to make it four in a row in two weeks.</p>
