      <p>NEW DELHI: The final act of formally inking the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance will play out in the national capital in the next couple days, setting the stage for a Delhi declaration of a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> ruling pact.</p>
      <p>Many senior <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a>, Sena and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> leaders started to arrived in Delhi by Sunday evening as their draft Common Minimum Programme for governance will get the formal seal of approval in the national capital. From Monday, the Sanjay Raut-led <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> will showcase the post-poll realignment in both the Houses when they move from treasury NDA benches to settle down among the Opposition seats.</p>
      <p>After completing the formality of taking NCP top body into confidence in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Pune">Pune</a>, party supremo Pawar will be in Delhi and start deliberations with senior Congress leaders such Ahmed Patel before meeting <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonia-Gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a> on Monday or Tuesday. Sena leaders, perhaps including the likely chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, will also reach here to join the deliberations in the coming days to make it a tripartite summit. Like Pawar completed the motions of taking into confidence the NCP leaders' team, Sonia Gandhi too may call a meeting of senior party leaders.</p>
