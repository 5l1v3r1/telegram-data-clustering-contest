      <p>Exeter is a city packed with history - much of which is reflected i some incredible street names.</p>
      <p>From Dix's Field to Mincinglake Road, Bampfylde Street to Egypt Lane, Exeter has an incredible variety of weird and wonderful names which leave many of us scratching our heads.</p>
      <p>Want to know what Flowerpot Lane has to do with bows and arrows, or what race took part along Parliament Street? Then read on...</p>

        <figcaption>Bampfylde Street, Exeter</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Bampfylde Street and <b>Bampfylde</b> Lane: </b>An interesting name but a relatively mundane reason by it. Bampfylde House was built by John Bampfylde between 1590 and 1594, and the road that linked that house to the High Street is named Bampfylde Street.</p>
      <p>The house was destroyed by German bombing in May 1942.</p>
      <p>Up until then, it had housed offices for solicitors insurance brokers and even the board of trade. Post-war, it was rebuilt and named Bampfylde Lane.</p>
      <p>What is now known as Bampfylde Street was also built after the war.</p>
      <p><b>Blackboy Road:</b> This was named after the Black Boy Inn - a place where Royalists used to meet to plot the overthrow of Oliver Cromwell. They named it after the future King Charles II, who became King of England in 1660. Charles was nicknamed 'blackboy' by his mother.</p>
      <p>Blackboy Road served as the main route out of Exeter to Taunton, Bristol and Bath, and was often referred to as the Bath Road. A fire there in 1799 reportedly destroyed 13 houses.</p>

      <p><b>Bonhay Road:</b> It's not entirely clear where this name comes from. It could be Norman French for 'good hay', although 'hay' also means enclosed by a hedge.</p>
      <p>A 1687 map shows the area named 'Bonehayer', while a 1744 map has it named 'Bunney'.</p>
      <p><b>Burnthouse Lane:</b> this comes from a farmhouse which was - yes, you guessed it - burnt out one Saturday night.</p>
      <p>In 1928, the whole area was cleared and 90 acres of ground was compulsorily purchased by the council and redeveloped for new housing as the West Quarter which had previously been there had became an impoverished slum area.</p>

      <p><b>Clapperbrook Lane:</b> Named after a clapperbrook bridge that crossed the Alphingbrook. Clapperbrook bridges are made from large, flat stone slabs. In 1819, the road was simply Water Lane, but a map in 1842 shows it had become Watery Lane by 1842. By 1862, it was Clapperbrook Lane.</p>
      <p><b>Dix's Field:</b> William Spicer Dix (1736-1804) was a brewer from Exe Lane who owned the land.</p>
      <p><b>Egypt Lane:</b> This small lane next to St Catherine's Chapel was also named Freren Lane, causing some confusion over the years. A lease in 1814 also strangely refers to it as Johnasses Lane.</p>
      <p>There is confusion over the origin of the name too, with some thinking it is a slang term, while letter in 1907 to the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette suggested that it was so named because the city allowed gypsies to encamp there. Gypsies were thought to have originated in Egypt.</p>
      <p>It was known from 1848 until 2005 as Chapel Street, but the rebuilding of the area of 2005 saw it revert to its former name.</p>
      <p><b>Flowerpot Lane:</b> The name Flowerpot probably comes from the medieval Floyer which derives from the Saxon for arrow maker. In 1086, Domesday records the owner as a Floher. The Floyers resided at Floyer Hayes, on what is now Haven Banks, until about 1580 and parts of the house were still standing as late as 1830-40.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Frog Street:</b> This was apparently named due to the prolific number of frogs which lived in the marshy ground not far from the River Exe. It famously saw <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/secret-rooms-house-moved-you-2452347">the House That Moved</a> there before it was dragged onto West Street.</p>

      <p><b>Gandy Street:</b> One of Exeter's most eclectic streets, this was actually known as Correstrete in 1265, probably due to the Middle English word for currying, or the curing of leather. It was also known as St Lucie's Lane in 1669 before becoming Gandy's Lane and then Gandy Street after Henry Gandy, Mayor of Exeter in 1661 and 1672.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Mincinglake Road:</b> The name comes from the Anglo Saxon word moenchin, meaning nun. The stream of the same name ran past St Katherine's Priory. The nuns dammed the stream further up the valley to create a fish lake, hence the nuns lake.</p>
      <p><b>Parliament Street:</b> The narrowest street in England, Europe or the world depending on who you believe, this narrow street dating from the 14th century actually (and fittingly) used to be called Small Lane.</p>
      <p>The source of its current name is unclear. One story suggests that it was renamed after the Civil War, as a comment that the Commonwealth had too much Parliament. Another story claims it was renamed when Parliament was derided by the City Chamber for passing the 1832 Reform Bill.</p>
      <p>An old tale claims a man who was the biggest in Exeter challenged anyone who thought they could beat him to a running race - provided he had a 20-metre head start. A younger, leaner and more athletic challenger accepted, but had not anticipated the race going through Parliament Street.</p>

      <p>It was apparently too narrow for him to overtake the hulking man, who went on to win the race and claim the bragging rights.</p>
      <p><b>Smythen Street and Butchers Row:</b> Blacksmiths used to be based on Smythen Street (smithing is the technique blacksmiths use for heating, hammering and forging metal), hence the word smithy - a place where blacksmiths work.</p>
      <p>Along similar lines, Butchers Row used to house an incredible 19 butchers around 1500. It is by the top of Smythen Street, where George's Hall is now. </p>

      <p><b>Waterbeer Street:</b> Surprisingly, this probably has nothing to do with beer. The first record of it was in 1253, when it appears on a deed as 'Waterberestrete' and later in 1327 as 'Waterber Strete' - possibly in relation to the ecclesiastical office of bearer of holy water.</p>
      <p>It could also be because of the wool trade: weavers used to refer to 19 ends of yarn running together out of a trough of water as a beer, and these troughs were potentially positioned on Waterbeer Street. However, the fact the wool trade was not established in the area in the 13th century suggests this is unlikely.</p>
      <p>Another possible source of the word beer is the 11th century berge, meaning hill, which in Devon is corrupted to beare as in Aylesbeare and Dunsbeer, and hence Water Berge (Hill) Street</p>
