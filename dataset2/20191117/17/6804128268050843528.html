      <h1>Granit Xhaka transfer latest: Arsenal willing to sanction sale in order to seal January transfer</h1>
      <h2>A round-up of the latest Granit Xhaka transfer speculation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:23:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha, Tashan Deniran-Alleyne</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka's future at Arsenal looks more uncertain than ever before.</p>
      <p>The incident against Crystal Palace saw the midfielder stripped of the club captaincy and the Switzerland international has missed four Arsenal games since.</p>
      <p>So what next for Xhaka? There has been a lot of comments made about the extraordinary incident and what's for certain is that head coach Unai Emery has a massive call to make with speculation growing about an exit in January.</p>
      <p>With that said, here's everything that's happened with Xhaka including comments from club legends, teammates, Emery and the next steps in the situation.</p>
      <h3>Club legends speak out</h3>
      <p>A number of former players - including <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/ian-wright-names-arsenal-player-17162585">Ian Wright</a>, <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/granit-xhaka-arsenal-palace-reaction-17159723">Nigel Winterburn</a> and <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/emery-xhaka-arsenal-captain-keown-17163126">Martin Keown</a> - have had their say on what should happen to Xhaka.</p>
      <p>Many of which are demanding he be stripped of the captaincy, meanwhile Emmanuel Petit <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/arsenal-news-xhaka-petit-emery-17163427">described the incident as a "betrayal"</a>.</p>
      <p>David Seaman has produced arguably the most surprising take with suggesting that David Luiz - not Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Matteo Guendouzi - take the armband.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"There are not many leaders there at all," he told talkSPORT. "I think David Luiz would be a good leader and a good choice, but is he too fresh in the squad to make him captain straight away?</p>
      <p>"That wouldn’t bother me, I’d have him as captain any day."</p>

      <h3>Lacazette 'likes' social media post</h3>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette, who was on the pitch when Xhaka was substituted, raised eyebrows by 'liking' a post on Instagram calling for his teammate to "never be seen in an Arsenal top" as well as for Emery to be sacked.</p>

      <p>He may have been an unused substitute, but Torreira was visibly upset at the confrontation between the Arsenal captain and the supporters.</p>

      <h3>Dani Ceballos message</h3>
      <p>The Arsenal midfielder sent a message to Arsenal fans calling on them to stick with the team following the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace.</p>

      <h3>What Emery has said</h3>
      <p>Emery said that Xhaka was wrong to swear at fans on Sunday and he expanded more on the situation during his pre-Liverpool press conference on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"It’s not easy for him and for the team. He is now devastated, sad," Emery said. "We spoke yesterday and Sunday night and this morning.</p>
      <p>"He trained normally with the group but he is devastated. He is sad about that situation.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"His commitment is great every time. He wants to help. His behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and club. Really he knows he was wrong.</p>
      <p>"He feels inside, very deep. It’s normal as a human. Every player needs the supporters' support."</p>
      <h3>Xhaka to offer an apology?</h3>
      <p>As of yet, Xhaka hasn't broken his silence amid what happened at the weekend.</p>
      <p>But will he apologise to the Arsenal fans? Emery has had his say.</p>
      <p>"But now what is the response we are seeing is he is devastated. The first is recover him. His feeling... we need our family, our friends, our supporters to support us, like us, love us.</p>

      <p>"He’s not feeling that with the supporters.</p>
      <p>"We are speaking with him. First be calm, be close with your family, be close with us also because we are your family. Be close also, we are going to try, with our supporters.</p>
      <p>"This is a step little by little in our moment."</p>

        <b>Is he still captain?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, Unai Emery confirmed last week that Xhaka has now been stripped of the captaincy, with striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang taking over the role.</p>
      <p>What's clear is this saga is far from over.</p>
      <h3>Emery demands apology</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/granit-xhaka-refuses-unai-emery-request-to-apologise-for-swearing-at-arsenal-fans-d6z5d9066">The Times</a>, Granit Xhaka has rejected Unai Emery’s request that he apologise to the Arsenal fans.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder faces an uncertain wait to see if he will be stripped of the captaincy after his confrontation with supporters during the Crystal Palace game.</p>
      <p>But according to the report, Xhaka is not willing to make a public apology to the fans that Emery believes he should make.</p>
      <h3>Xhaka's friend blasts supporters</h3>
      <p>Xhaka's friend and former teammate Patrik Dibrani has spoken out about the incident between the midfielder and Arsenal fans on Sunday, and has revealed that his friend did regret his actions straight away.</p>
      <p>However, Dibrani also claimed that the fans who threw abuse at Xhaka are 'tourists'.</p>
      <p>"It hurts me a great deal. Granit is like a brother to me," Dibrani told Swiss publication <a href="https://www.blick.ch/sport/">Blick</a>.</p>
      <p>"I understand that he did not react well to the booing but if you are a true fan of your club it is like a love affair.</p>
      <p>"You have to be there for each other in the bad times as well as the good. There should be no place for booing your own players.</p>
      <p>"I spoke on the phone to Granit after the game. He’s not in a good place – he is grief-stricken. He regretted his actions straight away. He is an emotional person.</p>
      <p>"The fans and the English media are quick to bury him. He is at an age when he can make mistakes, and only human," added Dibrani.</p>
      <p>"I think the fans who slaughter him are tourists. They are not genuine supporters.</p>
      <p>"Granit does everything for his football. He had a personal trainer, and missed out on partying.</p>
      <p>"Then he gets abused in the stadium and on social media. The comments are below the belt.</p>
      <p>"At Basel he was an undisputed first-teamer aged 18, and he was Borussia Monchengladbach’s youngest ever captain.</p>
      <p>"Now he gets slaughtered without mercy. It is not fair."</p>
      <h3>Xhaka's statement</h3>
      <p>Despite all the noise around his future since the incident, the Arsenal captain has remained quiet - until now.</p>
      <p>On Thursday evening the midfielder released a statement explaining his actions and reaffirming his commitment to the club.</p>
      <p>"After taking some time to reflect on what happened on Sunday afternoon, I would like to give you an explanation rather than just a quick response," he wrote in a statement via Arsenal's social media accounts. <br/><br/>"The scenes that took place around my substitution have moved me deeply. I love this club and always give 100% on and off the pitch," he said. <br/><br/>"My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have hurt me deeply. People have said things like "We will break your legs", "Kill your wife" and "Wish that your daughter gets cancer". That has stirred me up and I reached boiling point when I felt the rejection in the stadium on Sunday."</p>

      <h3>Xhaka speaks out</h3>
      <p>The Arsenal midfielder gave his first interview since the incident when he spoke to Swiss newspaper Blick over the weekend. The 27-year-old gave his thoughts on the reception from Gunners fans when he was substituted.</p>
      <p>"When my shirt number lit up on the board of the fourth official and then broke jealous jubilation of their own fans, that hit me very much and stirred up," he said.</p>
      <p>"It was very painful and frustrating.</p>
      <p>"For me, this reaction is still incomprehensible, especially in this vehemence and how extremely hostile I was here."</p>

      <h3>Milan linked with move</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.rsi.ch/sport/calcio/Xhaka-in-direzione-Milano-sponda-rossonera-12402312.html">RSI Sport</a>, Xhaka is heading out of the door at the Emirates Stadium during the January window, with a move to Serie A side Milan on the cards.</p>
      <p>The reports states that the midfielder is intent on leaving Arsenal during the window and Italy is the most likely destination due to former Arsenal director Ivan Gazidis' involvement in the club.</p>
