      <h1>‘Gears Tactics’ to Make an Appearance at This Year’s Game Awards in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:20:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>The Coalition and Microsoft have been focusing on <b><i>Gears 5</i></b> over the past year (seeing as it was, you know, released earlier this year), but what about <b><i>Gears Tactics</i></b>? The game was largely absent from this year’s E3, though Microsoft is <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3567125/microsoft-gears-war-offshoot-gears-tactics-still-development/">still very much at work</a> developing it. In fact, the strategy game will make an appearance at this year’s Game Awards, as was announced on Twitter.</p>

      <p>It’s still not clear what the game will be about. Other than Microsoft’s plans to release it on PC first, then port it to the Xbox One, we’ll just have to wait for the big reveal next month. The Game Awards 2019 are set to take place next month on Thursday, December 12. Gear 5 was released this past September on Xbox One and PC.</p>
