      <h1>Eamonn Brophy earns Scotland call as Lawrence Shankland is ruled out of Kazakhstan clash</h1>
      <h2>The Kilmarnock frontman could win his second cap after replacing Shankland in the squad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:10:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Eamonn Brophy has been called up to the Scotland squad as a replacement for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-shankland">Lawrence Shankland.</a></p>
      <p>The Dundee United striker has pulled out of the game on Tuesday having been an unused sub for Saturday's 2-1 win over Cyprus.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> star Brophy has one cap for his country, which came in the home win over Cyprus back in June.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old hasn't been at his best for the Rubgy Park side this season, with just three goals in 16 games in all competitions - but was hugely impressive under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> last season.</p>
      <p>The last of his three strikers did come in Killie's final game before the international break when his goal helped earn a 2-2 draw with Hamilton.</p>

      <p>Shankland missed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United's</a> win over Queen of the South because of international duty with fellow striker Nicky Clark grabbing one of the three goals.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old scored in his only start for the national side during a 6-0 win over San Marino.</p>
      <p>It was his second cap, having made his debut in the heavy defeat to Russia.</p>
