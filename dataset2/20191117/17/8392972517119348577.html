      <h1>Home Bargains will be CLOSED on Boxing Day as staff get extra day off over Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Second year in a row company has decided not to open on traditional sales day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:53:37+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>The Boxing Day sales are for many eager shoppers as enjoyable as unwrapping pressies the day before.</p>
      <p>However, going back to work straight after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">the 25th of December</a> is not many workers' idea of fun - and for retail sector employees in particular it is very rare to get much of a run of time off over the festive period.</p>
      <p>But this <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">Christmas</a>, employees of Home Bargains will be able to celebrate with even more turkey sandwiches and seasonal telly when they may have expected to be working.</p>
      <p>And that‚Äôs because the discount store chain is closing shop on Boxing Day - giving its 22,000 staff a wonderful Christmas present.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This is the second year in a row the company has decided not to open on the traditional shopping sales day.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the time off is not deducted from staff members‚Äô holiday allowance - meaning they are still being paid to take time off!</p>
      <aside>All shops should do this.</aside>
      <p>In social media posts shared on Twitter and Instagram, an announcement read: "To all our staff: Thank you for all your hard work once again this year.</p>
      <p>"All our stores will be closed on Boxing Day to ensure you are able to spend time with your friends and family.</p>
      <p>"We hope you enjoy the Christmas holiday."</p>

      <p>The post also thanked customers for their "understanding and support" as it praised staff for working hard throughout the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>Followers seemed to appreciate the Christmas gift, praising Home Bargains for their generosity and management.</p>
      <p>"How it should be üëèx," commented one impressed Insta user.</p>
      <p>"Total respect to H&amp;B," agreed another.</p>
      <p>And a third person suggested the idea should be rolled out more widely, remarking: "All shops should do this üôåüèºüëç."</p>
