      <h2>SNP looks to benefit from Conservative disaffection with Johnson north of the border</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:00:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anne-Sylvaine Chassany</a></address>
      <p>In the wealthy farmlands around the Scottish town of Stirling, site of celebrated victories against the English, Richard Hunter is preparing to change the habit of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>The former whisky executive, who voted against <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/f6d345ef-1347-4ec4-b4c1-13d5c19e0cbd">Scottish independence</a> in 2014 and in favour of the UK staying in the EU two years later, said he will abandon his loyalty to the Conservative party in next month’s general election. He will back the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, who has little chance of winning in Stirling, and his defection could help pave the way for the pro-independence <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/3c49c2af-784f-4311-9b46-f36a0c039836">Scottish National party</a> to triumph in the constituency. The Tories secured Stirling with a wafer thin majority of just 148 votes over the SNP at the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>Looking out over rolling fields at his home near Stirling, Mr Hunter said he has watched “in despair” as the Conservatives transformed into a hotbed of rightwing Brexiters under Prime Minister <a href="https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>’s leadership. “If you look at the personalities, I don’t recognise a centre-right party at all. I don’t think they understand Scotland and people who are less well off,” he said. “Am I really going to vote Conservative? No I am not.”</p>
      <p>The Tories were the natural home of Scotland’s centrist voters who opposed rising Scottish nationalism — until Mr Johnson came along. The prime minister’s hardline Brexit stance has created many political orphans like Mr Hunter. Beyond England’s borders it has also stoked nationalist resentments, triggering fears of a potential break-up of the UK.</p>
      <p>In Scotland, where 62 per cent voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, Mr Johnson’s policies could cost the Conservatives most of the 13 seats they secured in the 2017 election — and threaten the parliamentary majority the prime minister needs to pass the Brexit deal he negotiated with Brussels.</p>

      <p>“It’s difficult for the Conservative candidates up in Scotland,” said Ailsa Henderson, political scientist at Edinburgh university. “Until 2017, the party was unionist but divided on Brexit, so you could run as a Conservative candidate and declare you voted Remain and wanted a soft Brexit . . . And we know the Scottish electorate is not only less likely to support leaving the EU but also less likely to support a hard Brexit.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson’s divisive personality and the resignation of the popular Scottish Conservative party leader <a href="https://www.ft.com/stream/dd6c7131-5272-4c3f-81e3-7c2b4b1fc446">Ruth Davidson</a>, who was seen as instrumental in securing the 2017 seats, are not helping.</p>

      <p>Fran McMillan, a member of Stirling’s golf club, said she always voted Tory — because it was “the way I was brought up” — but does not like the prime minister. “I’m a Remainer, it’s been a disaster,” she said. “I can’t vote for Boris, he is a buffoon.”</p>
      <p>“Boris Johnson is the best recruiting sergeant for Scottish nationalism that the SNP have had since Margaret Thatcher,” said Tom Devine, history professor at the University of Edinburgh. “His persona, his background, the fact that people regard him as duplicitous and a phoney, none of that goes down well in Scotland.”</p>

      <p>In this Brexit-focused campaign, the SNP, the largest force in Scotland’s parliament in Edinburgh, has portrayed itself as the party of those who want to stay in the EU. While it will capture some of the Remain vote, it will also attract pro-Brexit nationalist voters, who are likely to put independence first, Ms Henderson said.</p>
      <p>However, polls show that Scottish voters are split over independence. Stirling’s Tory MP, Stephen Kerr, who insists he is a moderate Conservative seeking a “pragmatic Brexit deal”, is looking to exploit this division. He hopes to mobilise the unionist electorate by pointing out that Nicola Sturgeon, SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister, has been pressing for a second independence referendum as soon as next year.</p>
      <p>The SNP “would rather be ruled by Brussels”, the 59-year-old former businessman said. “This has been a very divisive period, people are sick of it. The union is not safe in the hands of the Lib Dems. Labour cannot be trusted.”</p>

      <p>Ian Carmichael, a 66-year-old former construction executive, agrees and backed Mr Kerr in 2017 after voting Labour all his life. But he has yet to make up his mind on how to vote in the forthcoming poll. “I voted to Remain but I am fervently anti-SNP. So it’s going to be between the Liberals and the Conservatives,” he said.</p>
      <p>Canvassing in Callander, a well-off rural town at the feet of snow-dusted crags, the SNP’s candidate, Alyn Smith, is careful not to antagonise voters such as Mr Carmichael, who worry about the economic consequences of independence. “In this election, it’s about making sure we have a big block of MPs in Westminster, using that to stop Brexit,” said the 46-year-old MEP. “Of course we want another [independence] referendum, but it will be brought forward when the people want it. We have to work out our proposition, we’re not there yet.”</p>
      <p>Brexit has caused some Scottish unionists to rethink their views on the SNP. Chris Deerin, head of think-tank Reform Scotland, voted against independence in 2014 because of the UK’s clout in global affairs, but “two years later England decided we were going to leave the EU”.</p>

      <p>“The reasons for staying with the UK didn’t seem to exist any more,” he said. “You think perhaps that English nationalism is on the rise in the south, to the point that it means an imbalance in the union. The Conservatives are moving to the right, Labour is moving to the hard left — perhaps there is an argument for deciding to run our own affairs.”</p>
      <p>Walking home on Stirling’s old bridge — close to where Scottish hero William Wallace crushed an English army in 1297, a victory featured in the Hollywood movie <i>Braveheart</i> — 22-year-old university student Ruairidh Galbraith said Brexit and Mr Johnson, who he described as an “incompetent” and a “racist”, had erased his doubts over independence.</p>
      <p>“In 2014, we were told that a vote for the union was a vote for the EU. And now everything is changed,” said Mr Galbraith.</p>

      <p>He added his family switched its allegiance from Labour to the SNP as the nationalist force embraced a centre-left, pro-EU platform. Labour held the Stirling seat for nearly two decades before losing it to the SNP in 2015, the year Jeremy Corbyn became party leader.</p>
      <p>Mr Galbraith admitted that getting out of the UK would hit the economy hard, “but fundamentally Scotland should be its own country”, he said.</p>
      <p>“We are politically so different from Westminster. We are progressive, more leftwing, the Scottish government really cares for the Scottish people and always has their best interests at heart . . . As a young person I can see the huge benefits the EU has had, such as the freedom of travel and settle in the EU.”</p>
