      <p>Another week, another box office bomb.</p>
      <p><i>Charlie's Angels </i>underperformed at the box office this weekend by taking in just $8.6 million in its debut, <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-ford-v-ferrari-wins-charlies-angels-flops-1203407329/">Variety </a></i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-ford-v-ferrari-wins-charlies-angels-flops-1203407329/">reports</a>. The reboot from Sony starring Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinska, and Elizabeth Banks came in behind <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>and <i>Midway</i>, the latter of which opened last week.</p>
      <p>This is the third week in a row that a major studio movie based on a well-known property tanked, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-ford-v-ferrari-flies-31m-charlies-angels-bombs-1255533?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><i>The Hollywood Reporter </i>notes</a>. Last week, <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, the sequel to <i>The Shining</i> that adapted Stephen King's book of the same name, also opened below expectations <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877605/shining-sequel-doctor-sleep-disappoints-box-office">with a weak $14 million debut</a>. The week prior, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> lived up to its title by debuting to just <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-terminator-dark-fate-opening-weekend-misfire-1203391110/">$29 million</a>, meaning this version of the franchise likely won't be back as the film is expected to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/terminator-dark-fate-box-office-flop-1203391309/">lose around $100 million</a>.</p>
      <p>All of this is despite the fact that each of these films received at least decent reviews. <i>Doctor Sleep</i> and <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> both earned fresh scores on Rotten Tomatoes, meaning 60 percent or more of critics recommended them, while <i>Charlie's Angels</i> is currently just barely short of that distinction with a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/charlies_angels_2019/">59 percent approval rating</a>. All three were also based on established intellectual property, though as has been clear this year with other bombs like <i>Men in Black: International</i>, that's not always enough to drive increasingly streaming-centric audiences out to theaters.</p>
      <p>All eyes once again are on next week's <i>Frozen 2</i>, as the sequel is expected to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-frozen-2-opening-weekend-early-tracking-1203389289/">easily clear $100 million</a> in its opening weekend and continue Disney's year of utter box office domination while many of its competitors are increasingly left out in the cold.</p>
