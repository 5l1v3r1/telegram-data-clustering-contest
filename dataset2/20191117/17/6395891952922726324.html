      <p><b>DEDHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Authorities say a fire has destroyed a more than 100-year-old barn at a historic site in Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>The Boston Globe reports that fire crews were called to the Endicott Estate in Dedham around 2 a.m. Saturday and found flames coming through the roof of a wooden two-and-a-half story barn.</p>
      <p>Firefighters from multiple departments quickly got the fire under control, but the barn was deemed a total loss. No injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Endicott Estate is a popular wedding venue owned by the town of Dedham. The 18-acre site includes several early 20th century buildings and is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
      <p>No other buildings were reported damaged except the barn, which was used to store equipment. Documents filed with the national register say the barn was built around 1904.</p>
