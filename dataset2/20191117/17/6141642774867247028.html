      <p>Aaron Ramsey is determined to relive his best experience in football by helping Wales reach the 2020 European Championship.</p>
      <p>Ramsey played a huge role in Wales’ march to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 when the Juventus playmaker was named in the official team of the tournament.</p>
      <p>But injuries had prevented Ramsey from featuring in Euro 2020 qualifying until he came on for the final half-hour of Wales’ 2-0 win in Azerbaijan on Saturday evening.</p>

      <p>Wales’ qualification destiny is now in their own hands as victory over Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday will secure second spot in Group E and a ticket to next summer’s finals across Europe.</p>
      <p>“It would mean everything again (to qualify),” Ramsey said.</p>
      <p>“We missed out on the World Cup, which was very disappointing.</p>
      <p>“We had the best time ever at the Euros and we want to experience something like that again.</p>

      <p>“We have a lot of new faces that haven’t experienced that, so for them as well it would be massive.”</p>
      <p>Wales were in a similar position two years ago in World Cup qualifying for Russia 2018.</p>
      <p>Chris Coleman’s side would have qualified automatically had they beaten the Republic of Ireland in Cardiff and Serbia failed to overcome Georgia.</p>
      <p>But Wales, who were without the injured Gareth Bale, lost 1-0 and even missed out on a play-off spot with the Republic leapfrogging them into second place.</p>

      <p>“But we have come on a lot since then.</p>
      <p>“I think we did the hardest part here to get the win, to come away to a place like this is always tricky.</p>
      <p>“Croatia came here and drew last time, so we know how difficult that is.</p>

      <p>“It’s good to be back. I felt sharp out there and I had some nice little touches.</p>
      <p>“I got a bit of a cut on my head but all is good.”</p>
      <p>Ramsey replaced Bale in Baku – also taking the captain’s armband from him for the final 30 minutes – after Wales’ talisman had returned following a month out with a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs said in his post-match assessment that Bale was “blowing a little bit”, but the Wales manager looks set to have his two key men available for the Cardiff City Stadium sell-out clash with Hungary.</p>
      <blockquote><b>361<br/></b>days between Aaron Ramsey's previous Wales appearance and winning his 59th cap in Azerbaijan</blockquote>
      <p>“It was a difficult decision,” Giggs said. “I thought if both started, then at least one of them wouldn’t be able to play on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“We’ve still got to assess it. It’s a quick turnaround.</p>
      <p>“Gareth was blowing a little bit which you can expect, but hopefully I’ll have the option to start both on Tuesday all being well.”</p>
      <p>Aberdeen forward Ryan Hedges has been called into the squad after Tom Lawrence was a late withdrawal from the Azerbaijan trip through illness.</p>
