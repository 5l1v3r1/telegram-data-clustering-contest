        <b>St Joseph’s Miltown (Clare) 0-7</b>
        <b> Clonmel Commercials (Tipperary) 0-9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clonmel Commercials’ hold over St Joseph’s Miltown was maintained on Sunday afternoon after a late four-point blitz dramatically edged them into the Munster Senior Club Final in a fortnight’s time.</p>
      <p>In front of a crowd of 1,715 in Hennessy Memorial Park, it was hosts Miltown that appeared set to complete back-to-back provincial final appearances when leading by 0-7 to 0-5 by the 55th minute.</p>
      <p>However, having prevailed in previous clashes in 1990 and 2015, Commercials would garner an unlikely hat-trick over the Clare champions after the Kennedy clan of midfielding brothers Jack (two points) and Conal, along with namesake Séamus, ensured a four-point turnaround at the death.</p>
      <p>Up to that juncture, Miltown were never headed after taking the advantage of a strong wind to build up a three-point interval cushion in what was a low-scoring yet utterly compelling tie.</p>
      <p>Midfielders Oisín Looney and Conor Cleary began the home charge with points in the opening 90 seconds. So while Clonmel settled through <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kevin+Fahey">Kevin Fahey</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Quinlivan">Michael Quinlivan</a> by the 10-minute mark, it was the intercounty experience of the Kelly and Cleary brothers that would up the ante for St Joseph’s for the remainder of the half.</p>
      <p>Gordon and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Graham+Kelly">Graham Kelly</a>, along with twins Eoin and Conor Cleary, provided the leadership and more significantly the scores to ensure that Miltown grabbed four of the last five points on their way to a 0-6 to 0-3 half-time cushion.</p>
      <p>Commercials’ wind-assisted backlash didn’t initially materialise after passing up three placed balls in a scoreless third quarter. And even when <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jason+Lonergan">Jason Lonergan</a> converted a brace of frees soon afterwards, a Conor Cleary reply at the other end left St Joseph’s clinging to a healthy two-point advantage with just five minutes of normal time remaining.</p>
      <p>Midfield siblings Conal and Jack Kennedy would alter that narrative to regain parity by the 57th minute before the former also teed up recent Tipperary All-Ireland winning hurler Séamus Kennedy to nudge Clonmel in front for the very first time in the next passage of play.</p>
      <p>With six minutes of additional time to come, all was not lost for the hosts but despite their best efforts, the final score would be obtained by a momentum-fuelled Commercials as Jack Kennedy provided the insurance point in the 64th minute to tee up a second Munster club decider in five years against Cork’s Nemo Rangers.</p>
