      <p>Styles, 25, hilariously played the human incarnation of a lonely woman's boyfriend/dog Doug in a pre-recorded video.</p>
      <p>Just before he is transforms back into a chihuahua, he tells the woman (played by Aidy Bryant): "Joan, I love you! Love the way you feed me ham. You're my life, my love, my everything, I love you just the way you am."</p>
      <p>He is seen wearing a dog collar, eating trash out of a bathroom garbage can and cowering at the sight of the vacuum cleaner.</p>
