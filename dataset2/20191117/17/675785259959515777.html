      <p>A medical secretary aged 89 has become one of the oldest workers to win an age discrimination claim.</p>
      <p>Eileen Jolly was awarded £200,000 by the NHS after being led from her office over claims she could not use a computer.</p>
      <p>A tribunal heard she was sacked for a “catastrophic failure in performance” after becoming stuck in “old secretarial ways”.</p>
      <p>She took her NHS trust to a employment tribunal and won one of the largest sums for age ­discrimination.</p>
      <p>Judge Andrew Gumbiti-Zimuto wrote: “There was evidence of the claimant’s training having been inadequate, incomplete and ‘on the job’ training was ad hoc and not directed.”</p>
      <p>In September 2016 Eileen, who has a heart condition and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/facts-arthritis-how-you-can-6416990">arthritis</a> , was suspended from her job at Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading.</p>

      <p>She was dismissed in January 2017 and her appeal against the decision was rejected.</p>
      <p>The following week Eileen was prescribed antidepressants.</p>
      <p>The tribunal heard she felt such a “deep sense of shame” over losing her job that she lied to her family, including her late husband, that she had retired.</p>
