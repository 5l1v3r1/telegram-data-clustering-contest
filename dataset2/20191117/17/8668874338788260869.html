      <h1>Andy Goode can't resist online dig after Saracens humbling</h1>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> flyhalf turned pundit Andy Goode couldn’t resist delivering a dig into <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> after their humbling at the hands of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> in Paris.</p>
      <p>Mark McCall’s men were easily beaten by 30 points to 10 at the Paris La Défense Arena by their hosts, who outgunned a relatively inexperienced Saracens team.</p>
      <p>Racing pulled away before grabbing a late bonus point from the men in black and red, whose domestic issues regarding their salary cap woes apparently coming home to roost.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/saracens-salary-cap-scandal-is-bigger-than-bloodgate-andy-goode/">RugbyPass columnist Goode</a> was in no mood for mercy on Twitter, where he whaled into his former club.</p>
      <p>“So Saracens are currently finding out what it’s like in the Champions Cup for the other Premiership Rugby clubs who stick to the wage cap.”</p>

      <p>Goode has been a vocal critic of Sarries and was clearly reveling in their struggles.</p>
      <p>The London club are set to drop their planned appeal against a £5.4million fine and a 35-point penalty for a breach of the salary cap, the PA news agency understands.</p>
      <p>Goode wrote: “News is Saracens won’t review the £5.36 million fine &amp; 35 point deduction, if true then they are clearly guilty as charged &amp; the next question will be what about this season as there’s no way they can be under the Premiership Rugby salary cap if they haven’t been previously!”</p>

      <p>The back-to-back Premiership champions and reigning European champions had initially announced their intention to appeal against what they deemed to be “heavy-handed” punishments that were further described by club chairman Nigel Wray as “absolutely devastating”.</p>
      <p>But ahead of Monday’s deadline to officially serve notice of appeal, Saracens are now poised to confirm they will not be doing so.</p>
