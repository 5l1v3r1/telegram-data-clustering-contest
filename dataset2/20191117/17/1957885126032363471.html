      <p>Remember that Dead Island sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-05-08-dead-island-2-is-still-alive-deep-silver-insists">we were promised</a>? Since its reveal waaaaaay back at E3 2014, the sequel's seen three development studios and a number of delays, but if you're worried publisher Koch Media has forgotten all about it, CEO Klemens Kundratitz wants you to know the numerous delays are merely evidence of the team's dedication to "getting it right".</p>
      <p>"My favourite question," Kundratitz said when our friends at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-14-how-koch-media-is-ensuring-classic-brand-comebacks-are-worth-the-wait">GI.biz</a> asked for an update on the beleaguered zombie sequel. "Look, Dead Island is a very important brand for us and we've got to get it right. It's just a testimony of our dedication to get it right.</p>
      <p>"It's a great story to tell everyone that it's on its third studio, but we like to be judged on the end result and we're really confident that when it comes out it's going to be a kick-ass zombie game. We'll certainly give it all our power."</p>
      <p>Although series creator Techland initially hoped to develop the sequel, in the end, it realised it was too busy with Dying Light, so Yager took over with a view to releasing in Q2 2015. Since then Dead Island 2 has since changed hands two more times, moving from Yager to Sumo Digital in 2016, and then again to Dambuster Studios which took the helm earlier this year. As yet, there's no firm commitment on when the game might finally be released.</p>
