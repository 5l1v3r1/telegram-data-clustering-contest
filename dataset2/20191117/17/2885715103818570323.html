      <p>Ashton Agar, Australia’s left-handed spinner, was left with a bloody nose while attempting a catch to dismiss his own brother in Western Australia’s Marsh One-Day Cup clash against South Australia on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Agar suffered a laceration to the bridge of his nose in the domestic one-day match after he dropped a catch off Wes Agar at Karen Rolton Oval.</p>
      <p>Rated as one of the better fielders down under, the 26-year-old ran around to attempt a straightforward catch at mid-on but slipped and copped the ball right between his eyes. With blood on Agar’s face, teammate Jhye Richardson called for medical assistance quickly.</p>
      <p>The force of the shot had knocked Agar’s hat and sunglasses off his head, but after some treatment, he was able to leave the field holding a towel to his head. Here is the moment:</p>

      <p>Later, Wes admitted the incident shook him but was heartened after speaking to his brother post-match.</p>
      <p>“He slipped over and the ball hit his glasses and the glasses split him open. The doctor wanted to stitch him up, but he just got engaged so, he said he’ll leave it to a plastic surgeon,” the younger Agar was quoted as saying by <i>cricket.com.au</i>.</p>
      <p>“I was pretty rattled. It looked really bad. I was just worrying about his health. I wasn’t thinking about anything else, I just ran out of my crease to go see him. I didn’t feel great, but thankfully he’s okay.”</p>
      <p>Agar did not play any further part in the match, which Western Australia won by six runs. He has played four Tests and nine ODIs between 2013 and 2018.</p>
