        <b>We all know Finding Nemo says ‘fish are friends, not food’ but these little creatures have a death wish on Seven Worlds, One Planet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the Australia dedicated episode of the David Attenborough nature documentary, tiny fish are tasked with cleaning a shark’s mouth in the hope and prayer they don’t get eaten in the process.</p>
      <p>In the Great Barrier Reef, Grey Reef Sharks are prominent predators to the smaller fish around it – but it turns out that some fish are bonafide hustlers and with a side business in dentistry.</p>
      <p>Cleaner wrasse fish clean the teeth for sharks, giving them some pearly white smiles by picking away the debris stuck in their teeth and parasites that have set up home there.</p>
      <p>So they get a free meal…on the condition they don’t get eaten in the process.</p>
      <p>Talk about a risky business but you’ve got to admire the tenacity of them!</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>In scenes set to air in the episode, the sharks are seen with their mouth wide as two or three wrasse swim in and get to work, before they all head on about their day.</p>

      <p>Honestly, how can anyone complain about their line of work again…at least you’re not literally heading in the direction of the belly of the beast!</p>
      <p>As it turns out, keeping your teeth in good condition is essential wherever you are in the world (and whoever you are in the world!)</p>
      <p>The latest edition of the series covers the most ground yet – with the hundreds of creatures of the massive continent getting touched on in the new addition to the series.</p>
      <p>Expect some of the weird and wonderful creatures that inhabit the country, which was mostly left alone for thousands of years before humans inhabited it.</p>
      <p>For example, in the jungles we meet a cassowary – one of the most dangerous birds in the world – stands six feet tall.</p>
      <p>We’ll also see the secret islands of Australia, where Tasmanian devils run rampant, and then our beloved regular features of the country – kangaroos and wombats.</p>
