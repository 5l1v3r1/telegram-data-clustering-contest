        <b>Kilcoo (Down) 1-8 Derrygonnelly (Fermanagh) 0-9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kilcoo deployed their vast experience to telling effect at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh on Sunday where they clinically closed out a tense, rugged Ulster club championship semi-final to earn the right to face <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Naomh+Conaill">Naomh Conaill</a> in the decider.</p>
      <p>The Down champions were more enterprising, protected their possession better and a revealed solid defence that frustrated Derrygonnelly time and again.</p>
      <p>In what was a turgid, relatively flat first-half Kilcoo looked sharp and effective in building up a 0-4 to 0-2 lead by the half-way stage, with Derrygonnelly registering points in the first and third minutes without managing to land another score before the break.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Ryan McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Paul Devlin and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jerome+Johnston">Jerome Johnston</a> fired over the Kilcoo scores but within seven minutes of the start of the second-half the sides were deadlocked at 0-5 each after Garvan Jones (2) and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Declan+Cassidy">Declan Cassidy</a> had hauled Derrygonnelly back into the game.</p>
      <p>But almost immediately Kilcoo struck a decisive blow when Aaron Branagan fired in the only goal of the game. Derrygonnelly responded with points from Garvan Jones, Conall Jones and Jack Love but scores from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Eugene+Branagan">Eugene Branagan</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ryan+Johnston">Ryan Johnston</a> helped to take Kilcoo over the line.</p>
      <p>Derrygonnelly’s Leigh Jones and Kilcoo’s Jerome Johnston were red carded in the closing minutes.</p>
