      <p>A ‘nightmare’ feud between two retired couples over their driveways has ended up in court after one pair sprayed their neighbour with a hosepipe.</p>
      <p>Magistrates heard how Harold Burrows, 70, got soaked when he cleared up garden debris washed under his gate and tried to return it to his neighbours’ drive in Denbigh, North Wales.</p>
      <p>He had strapped a GoPro camera to himself after years of squabbling with the pair, capturing footage which was shown in court.</p>

      <p>Barry Lee and Hellynne Lee, both 72, admitted common assault on June 4.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Julia Galston said Ms Lee had sprayed Mr Burrows and Mr Lee then did the same, remarking: ‘He likes getting wet, this little man.’</p>
      <p>Ms Galston said Ms Lee called Mr Burrows’ wife Jean a ‘witch’ and him a ‘moron’.</p>

      <p>‘The incident has had a huge effect on Mr and Mrs Burrows’, Ms Galston added.</p>
      <p>Mr Burrows, an MBE-decorated search team volunteer and Ms Burrows, a charity shop volunteer, moved to the area 20 years ago and started having problems with the Lees over garden waste turning up in their driveway.</p>
      <p>The neighbours resorted to police mediation, after which the Burrows were advised to install CCTV at their house, the court heard.</p>
      <p>The slope between their adjacent properties and the Lees’ habit of cleaning their driveway with their hose rather than a brush meant ‘crud’ would flow into the Burrows’ driveway, defence solicitor Robert Vickery said.</p>
      <p>He told the court that the property developers’ failure to follow plans when the estate was built was probably the ‘root cause’ of the feud, and the neighbours used to be friends.</p>

      <p>He told magistrates at Llandudno: ‘You may wonder what on earth are we doing here in a criminal court dealing with that? The reason is, sadly, Mr and Mrs Lee and Mr and Mrs Burrows can’t live peacefully together and have had many, many years of aggravation between them.’</p>

      <p>Mr Vickery said Mrs Lee was wrong to spray Mr Burrows but thought there was ‘some provocation’ in light of their history.</p>
      <p>In the clip Mr Burrows is shown dividing the debris and placing some of it on the Lees’ driveway.</p>
      <p>Mr Vickery continued: ‘It’s just utter madness from each point of view. I don’t think anyone in this case comes out with any credit. It’s beggars belief people can’t live together’</p>
      <p>The Lees had spent £8,500 on county court action but now plan to move, he added.</p>

      <p>Mrs Galston added for the prosecution: ‘The Crown don’t seek to minimise this assault. It’s a nasty assault. Mr Burrows is entitled to be in his own garden without being sprayed with the hosepipe.’</p>
      <p>Outside court Mr Burrows said: ‘It’s been a nightmare living next door. I will be glad when they sell up.’</p>
