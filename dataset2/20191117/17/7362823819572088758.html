      <p>"We have this storm going down across parts of the mid-Atlantic coastline," Fox News' Chief Meteorologist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/rick-reichmuth">Rick Reichmuth</a> said on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-and-friends">Fox &amp; Friends</a>." "This is a really strong coastal storm; it's bringing really rough conditions across the ocean we'll see some beach erosion from this."</p>
      <p>By Monday, Reichmuth said the storm will "very slowly' pull off to the north.</p>
      <p>"Throughout the day today, into tomorrow, and into tomorrow night as it does, we're going to see some rain, we're going to see some ice, and we're going to see a little bit of snow from this that will total up," he said.</p>
