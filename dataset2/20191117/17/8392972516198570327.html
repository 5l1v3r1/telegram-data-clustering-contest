      <p>Christmas is a time for indulgence and letting your hair down – even if it's just for a day or two.</p>
      <p>And as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">festive food and drinks</a> go, they don't come more indulgent than the range of 'cake'-themed gin liqueurs being sold at B&amp;M.</p>
      <p>There are three delicious flavours in the range, and each one tastes just like the yummy traditional cake it's paying tribute to.</p>
      <p>What's more, these alcoholic treats are currently on sale with £2 off the recommended retail price.</p>

      <p>These colourful tipples are manufactured by Brambles and come in 50cl bottles – that should give you more than enough for Christmas AND New Year.</p>
      <p>The first flavour is Battenberg Cake. Described by B&amp;M as "a bold gin liqueur with notes of marzipan and vanilla cake", this one reminds us of visits to our grandparents' house as children.</p>
      <p>Next up is Cherry Bakewell Tart, "an almond and cherry gin liqueur with a hint of pastry".</p>
      <p>Finally, there's Lemon Drizzle Cake, which is marketed as "a zesty lemon gin liqueur with soft vanilla cake notes".</p>
      <p>It's so authentic, you almost want to have a nice cup of tea with it – but seeing as this is liqueur and not actually cake, we wouldn't recommend it!</p>
      <p>All three of the liqueurs contain 20% alcohol.</p>

      </p>
      <p>B&amp;M describes the drinks as "delicious and unique gifts for the gin lover in your life".</p>
      <p>The popularity of gin has soared in recent years, with hundreds of new flavours making their way onto supermarket shelves.</p>
      <p>According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), an incredible 73 million bottles were sold in the UK last year, costing around £2billion.</p>

      <p>Of course, B&amp;M isn't the only supermarket chain selling drinks that should go down a treat at Christmas.</p>
      <p>Aldi is offering a fig, honey and cinnamon rum liqueur, priced £9.99.</p>
      <p>And another of our favourites is Boodles Mulberry Gin, available at M&amp;S for £25.</p>
