        <b>The start of Alexis Sanchez’s Inter career has been ruined by an ankle injury but the Chile star is progressing well in his recovery</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alexis Sanchez’s recovery from ankle surgery is on track and the Inter forward could return ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>Sanchez suffered a dislocated ankle and tendon damage while playing for Chile against Colombia in October.</p>
      <p>The need to have an operation meant three months on the sidelines, curtailing the early stages of his loan stay at San Siro from Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Inter’s head of medical services Piero Volpi told La Cuarta he is optimistic about Sanchez’s speed of recovery, with the 30-year-old aiming to resume work with a ball in the near future.</p>
      <p>“It is a delicate injury, but the recovery is going very well, the deadlines are being met,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Mid-January [is the return date] but we’ll see. Alexis could even come back a little earlier if all goes well.</p>
      <p>“He has not yet done work with the ball, but we hope that in the next few days we will have news about it. Everything is going well.”</p>
      <p>Sanchez scored on his only Serie A start for Inter, a 3-1 win at Sampdoria where he was later sent off, and has made four appearances overall for Antonio Conte’s side.</p>
      <p>Inter’s first game of 2020 is away to Napoli in the league on January 5, while they host Atalanta a week later.</p>
