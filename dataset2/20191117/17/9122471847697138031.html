      <h1>The Browns Reportedly Shut Down A Myles Garrett Interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:34:52+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>In the wake of the indefinite suspension handed down to Cleveland Browns DE Myles Garrett for his helmet swing at Pittsburgh Steelers QB Mason Rudolph, he has largely been silent outside of a PR statement.</p>
      <p>But FOX Sports NFL insider Jay Glazer revealed today that Garrett agreed to do a sit-down interview with him to address everything that happened.</p>
      <p>As fascinating as it would have been to get Garrett’s side of the story though, we won’t be hearing it. The Cleveland Browns have made sure of that.</p>
      <p>Glazer explained that before heading to the airport to fly out and meet with Garrett, the Browns informed him that he could not do the interview.</p>

      <p>That certainly doesn’t paint the Browns in a good light, who have quickly seen the criticism of them turn from being a clown show to being one of the most undisciplined teams in NFL history.</p>
      <p>Garrett will miss the remainder of the season and will have to appeal to the league for reinstatement. But he is expected to appeal the suspension.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Browns DT Larry Ogunjobi earned a suspension of his own for having a role in the brawl that erupted in the waning seconds of their win over Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>Cleveland will face the Miami Dolphins next week without their star pass rusher, and with many of their players likely feeling a lot lighter in their wallets.</p>
      <p>Would a Myles Garrett interview have been enlightening or unnecessary?</p>
