      <h3>Liverpool 0 Everton 1</h3>
      <p>Accompanied by a huge cheer from those of blue persuasion at the final whistle, Everton won a Mersey derby at Anfield.</p>
      <p>“It means a lot to the club,” said the Everton manager Willie Kirk. “It’s been a while since an Everton team won here.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, while their mens side have failed to secure a win at the home of their local rivals this millennium, the womens’ team were victorious there at the first time of asking. It was a victory, though, that in truth came about largely as the result of an intervention by Anke Preuss, whose wretched involvement in the only goal of the game was the most calamitous by a Liverpool goalkeeper since Loris Karius at the 2018 Champions League final.</p>
      <p>“The only way they were going to get a goal was if we gave them one,” said the Liverpool manager Vicky Jepson. “And we did.”</p>
      <p>The last Mersey derby in the WSL had drawn 1,800 diehards to Prenton Park. But there were 23,500 here at Anfield, filling the place with high-pitched excitement. It was an unusual crowd at Liverpool’s home stadium, the normal droves of Norwegian tourists replaced by scores of local families. With admission prices set at £5 for adults and free for children, many were clearly taking advantage of the chance to enjoy a game at a place from which they are normally priced out.</p>
      <p>The pity for them was that, unlike the thousands who normally head here to watch their team eviscerate all comers, there was not much to cheer. The Liverpool Women’s side are experiencing a season that can be best described as indifferent. While their male counterparts fly unobstructed at the top of the Premier League, they sit bottom of the WSL, having accrued just one point.</p>
      <p>It was quickly clear what the problem is: Liverpool may dominate the ball, but they just cannot come close to scoring. This is not a side blessed with the finishing zest of the bunch that normally plays in this ground; heading into the derby, they had so far this season scored just once. And that was from the penalty spot against Bristol City.</p>
      <p>Once again, for all of Niamh Charles’s pacey running and Mel Lawley’s intelligent passing, for much of the first half they barely came close to encroaching on the Everton area. Their best effort was when Kirsty Linnett’s header appeared to be destined for the corner of the visitors’ goal. But the keeper Tinja Korfela brilliantly dived to scoop the ball round the post. 20 minutes later, Linnett drove wide from outside the box. In between her two efforts, Liverpool had created nothing beyond some neat passing.</p>

      <p>Not that Everton were any more threatening. Kirk had claimed before the game that he was in possession of a more talented squad than his rival. There was little evidence of that in the early exchanges, when clearing the ball as far as possible out of defence seemed the limit of the visitors’ ambition. Until, just after the fourth official had held up the board indicating there was a minute’s added time, Lucy Graham had Everton’s first shot. Struck from well outside the Liverpool area, it didn’t look anything beyond a token effort, a speculative strike apparently drifting into the hands of the goalkeeper Anke Preuss. But as it travelled it appeared to have adopted the qualities of a bar of soap and squirmed out of Preuss’s hands to plop over the line. It meant – after just one shot on target - Everton went into the halftime break leading. It also meant Preuss headed for the dressing room in tears, consoled by the Liverpool goalkeeping coach.</p>
      <p>In response, Jepson attempted to inject some heft into her forward line, bringing on Rinsola Babjide for the diminutive centre forward Courtney Sweetman-Kirk, who had been gifted absolutely no room against the excellent Everton centre back, Gabby George. Babjide’s first involvement was a surging run down the wing, beating two defenders before swinging in a cross that found Charles on the edge of the Everton box. But Danielle Turner slid in with a fine tackle to prevent her from hitting a shot goalwards.</p>
      <p>Babijde added real urgency to the Liverpool effort. But her crosses rarely found a player in red. And for all the huff and puff, nothing came of the lung-busting effort. So it was that the most unlikely of outcomes took place at Anfield: Liverpool lost and remain rooted to the bottom of the table. </p>
