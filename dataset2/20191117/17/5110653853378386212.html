      <h1>What channel is Patriots vs. Eagles on today? Schedule, time for Week 11 NFL game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:45:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>The Eagles enter <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-11-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/r0rlms6mlk3l1finrne3igfiu">Week 11</a> tied for the lead in the NFC East, but a game against the Patriots makes a return to .500 likely for Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Both teams are coming off a bye. Last time out, New England took its first loss of the season to Baltimore. Still, the Patriots are tied for the best record in the league and are outscoring their opponents by more than 19 points per game. The last time a team had that a point differential that high over a full season was New England's undefeated 2007.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Though they'll be on the road, the Patriots will be expected to beat Philadelphia. The Eagles have crept to 5-4 with wins over Buffalo and Chicago, but their body of work remains unimpressive, even if it's good enough to lead the division for now.</p>
