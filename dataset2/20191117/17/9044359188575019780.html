      <p>Heart Evangelista revealed her secret on how she maintains her weight even without exercise: She gets her diet food from Aivee Cafe.</p>
      <p>"What I like about this place is even if it's like diet food, it's really good and I don't workout I just have the diet food and I've maintained my weight," said the Kapuso Queen of Creative Collaborations.</p>

      <p>Heart said when she got married, she gained 20 pounds and now that she's back to her pre-marriage weight, Heart said it's easier to maintain her weight with Dr. Food, the meals prepared by Aivee's in-house nutritionists.</p>
