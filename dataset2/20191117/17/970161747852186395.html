      <p>A disgruntled Greggs customer has hit out at a member of staff who asked if he was ‘sitting in’ when he bought a box of 12 doughnuts.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Daz Gaz was so upset by the question, he wrote about the encounter on Twitter and included two crying face emojis.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Just bought a box of 12 doughnuts from Greggs for my work and the bird asked if I’m sitting in or taking away’.</p>
      <p>The tweet has been shared more than 1,500 times and received around 35,000 likes, suggesting his experience resonated with people.</p>
      <p>Some said the question was ‘insulting’ for a large order and suggested he was being food shamed.</p>
      <p>One user said: ‘I got asked a similar question in a Greggs in Hillington, it had no seats or chairs. Seriously.’</p>

      <p>Another said: ‘Surely logic and common sense should come into play for extreme situations’.</p>

      <p>However, several Greggs employees commented on the tweet to say they had to ask the question regardless of what the customer was ordering.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Darcyjadex said: ‘lmao I work for Greggs and we get b*llocked for not saying it even if they’ve got 50 sandwiches, 10 sausage rolls and 20 cakes for one person we still have to ask x</p>
      <p>Another said: ‘I was told off once for not asking if someone was eating in or taking away a loaf of bread looool. welcome to gr*ggs’.</p>
      <p>Others accused the customer of being overly sensitive and criticised him for using ‘insulting’ language to describe a female member of staff.</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a ‘regular’ Greggs customer publicly shamed a staff member and reported him to the area manager – because he ‘bantered’ with her about how often she came in.</p>

      <p>Kathy Readon, 21, went to buy pizza from a branch in Hampshire on Wednesday afternoon when the employee joked ‘you’re in here every day, you’re going to get sick of this eventually’.</p>
      <p>Kathy failed to see the funny side and described it as all her ‘worst fears happening all at once’.</p>
      <p>She told him she could not afford to eat there every day then took to Facebook to name the staff member and demanded an explanation from Greggs about the ‘dressing down’ for being a regular.</p>

      <p>After complaining, the chain apologised and sent a £6 voucher.</p>
      <p>People told Kathy that she was over-reacting, but she defended her complaint saying she suffered from anxiety.</p>
      <p>She said;<b> ‘</b>Im very anxious, I don’t really talk to people. But I went in, I ordered what I normally order and I think he was trying to be banterous with me but it did not come off that way. ‘He essentially just made fun of me for ordering pizza and it kind of felt like he was making fun of unhealthy habits.</p>
      <p>‘It came across like he was picking on me. There were other people in the store and he kept saying that I was in there every single day.’</p>
      <p>She later admitted that she may have overreacted and deleted the post.</p>
