      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:28:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/eoin-burke-kennedy-7.1837462" target="_blank">Eoin Burke-Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>Tapping into the vinyl renaissance, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Golden+Discs">Golden Discs</a> is making a comeback and has opened four new stores already this year, including a new flagship store in Dublin’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Jervis+Shopping+Centre">Jervis Shopping Centre</a> over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The company appeared to be an endangered species only a few years ago with the wholesale switch to music streaming services such as Spotify but the renewed popularity of vinyl records has given it a new lease of life.</p>
      <p>The Jervis Shopping Centre outlet brings its store network in the Republic to 21.</p>
      <p>The vinyl renaissance is driving this expansion, and the flagship Jervis store will be a 2,500 square feet full of new release and deep catalogue vinyl, the company said.</p>
      <p>“Having only one city-centre store in Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre, we have been inundated with requests to return to the Henry Street shopping district,” chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Stephen+Fitzgerald">Stephen Fitzgerald</a> said.</p>
      <p>“Our team has spent a lot of time looking for the right space and we believe this spacious flagship store will be a superb return to the Jervis Shopping Centre,” he said.</p>
      <p>57 years after it first launched, Golden Discs remain one of Ireland’s most well-known retail brands.</p>
