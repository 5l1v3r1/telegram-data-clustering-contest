      <p>Beyoncé went full glam on Saturday night for night two of the Shawn Carter Foundation Gala. Wearing a sequined silver dress and white fur shawl, she joined Jay Z at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florida for the event looking stunning (per usual). The gala was also attended by Jay Z’s mother, Gloria, as well as Tyler Perry, Meek Mill, DJ Khaled, and Normani, who also wowed in a glittering fringe dress. The event also included a special performance by soon-to-be Grammys host, Alicia Keys.</p>

      <p>The foundation, which was founded by Jay Z in 2002 helps children further their education and all proceeds from Saturday’s event will go toward scholarship funds, college prep workshops, goodwill programming, and study abroad programs. Jay Z recently spoke to <i>Billboard </i>about the meaning behind the foundation and the importance of the gala.</p>
      <p>“Equipping our youth with the tools to succeed will always be a priority for me and my family,” <a href="https://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-night-out-casino-florida/">he said</a> back in October. “I’m looking forward to continuing that mission at this year’s Shawn Carter Foundation Gala Weekend, where we’ll celebrate our scholars and continue to support young people in a meaningful way.”</p>
