      <p>Bafana Bafana created a number of chances against Sudan but only managed to score one, and head coach Molefi Ntseki has shared his thoughts on the wastefulness.<br/><br/><b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/bafana/2021-africa-cup-of-nations-qualifier-report-south-africa-v-sudan-17-november-2019/667614">Euro-Based Players Impress As Bafana Sink Group C Leaders</a></b></p>
      <p>South Africa claimed their first win in Group C after Lebogang Phiri's first-half strike secured a 1-0 win over Sudan at Orlando Stadium.</p>
      <p>Bafana were guilty of missing numerous chances on the day, but Ntseki was pleased with the movement of his players that resulted in all the opportunities.</p>
      <p>"Firstly, compliment because you can't create chances if there's no movement, if there is no commitment, the belief to get to the box and create those chances. We compliment. All that was important for us was composure when we were about too finish," Ntseki told SABC after the game.<br/>"If you look at the chances we missed in the first ten minutes of the game we could have just tapped the ball in, we couldn't, so at half-time we said, "no, no, we're creating chances let's be composed, let's pick the spot and get goals".<br/>"What actually derailed our play [in the second-half] was [Thapelo] Morena picking up a knee injury, [Thulani] Serero a bit of injury and remember Dean Furman played 90 minutes in Ghana, Sifiso Hlanti also 90 minutes and also the captain [Thulani Hlatshwayo], part of the work had to be done especially on the sides, that's why we had to reserve Sifiso from going forward and stay at the back and Dean Furman we also said "you don't have to go [forward], just give us balance", so I think under the circumstances we did well, we got the three points we were looking for."</p>
