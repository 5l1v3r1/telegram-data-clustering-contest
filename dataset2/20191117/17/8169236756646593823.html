      <h1>Arsenal hold talks with father of exciting £38.5m-rated attacker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T17:09:24+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-contact-reiniers-father-bid-20899778">the Mirror</a> via <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191115/471608913130/reinier-objetivo-del-barca-flamengo-promesa-de-brasil.html">Mundo Deportivo</a>, Premier League giants Arsenal have made contact with the father of Brazilian wonderkid Reinier Jesus in a bid to lure the ace to the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mundo Deportivo add that Reinier’s father made a trip to Europe to tour the facilities of clubs interested in his son’s signature.</p>
      <p>European giants Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Juventus are also eyeing a move for the starlet.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old attacking midfielder has been sensational since breaking into Flamengo’s first-team and the ace has a release clause of £60m (€70m) in his current contract.</p>
      <p>Interested clubs aren’t likely to be required to pay the ace’s full release clause though, Mundo Deportivo add that the youngster’s signature is more likely to command a fee between £34m to £38.5m (€40m to €45m).</p>

      <p>Mirror Football report that Arsenal are hoping to use Gabriel Martinelli’s recent success to boost their attempts to sign the talent.</p>
      <p>Martinelli joined the Gunners from Brazilian outfit Ituano this summer and has already established himself as one of the most exciting talents in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Reinier has also starred for Brazil Under-17s side, the ace scored three goals in just four games during the South American Under-17s Championships earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Reinier is a different style of attacking midfielder, standing at 6ft2in tall – there’s no doubt that the youngster could find it easier to adapt to the Premier League than some South American talents have found over the years.</p>
