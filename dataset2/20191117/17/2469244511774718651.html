      <p>Devon chef Doug Grigg has just won an award for his creative dishes at The Oyster Shack - a famously laid-back restaurant which was literally created by customer demand.</p>
      <p>The Oyster Shack has been there 30 years and has a new 18 course taster menu for foodies.</p>
      <p>Originally the restaurant was literally  an oyster farm with row after row of oyster purification tanks where the oysters were brought from the River Avon to be cleaned.</p>
      <p>But word soon spread among seafood lovers who know their stuff. And people began to turn up 'in their droves' - and they would sit down and eat their fresh oysters on the spot.</p>
      <p>To begin with seafood lovers brought their own packed lunch, some good bread, a deck chair and a bottle of wine or two - and just sit right down, shuck their own oysters and tuck in on the spot.</p>
      <p>You couldn't get a fresher oyster!</p>
      <p>That was 30 years ago. Now The Oyster Shack is in the top five seafood restaurants in Devon and Cornwall, but back then oyster fans turned up and ate their fresh purchases on the spot. The owners remembered: "People would pitch up their own deckchairs and while away an afternoon in the peace and quiet of the Avon Valley.  Thus in a (quite literally) organic way, The Oyster Shack was born.</p>
      <p>"Keeping this ethos alive, we have extended on to the concrete patch and house a restaurant both inside and outside - winters are rustic and cosy inside by our roaring fire whilst Summertime is enjoyed al fresco outdoors."</p>
      <p>Everything about The Oyster Shack is affected by the sea - even the route you take to get there. If the tide is out you can drive along the tidal road past the Avon Estuary.</p>
      <p>When the sea is high, meander along the winding Devon lanes and you will find The Shack tucked into the valley under a bright orange sail on Stake’s Hill.</p>
      <p>Check the tide times first!</p>
      <p>Now Senior Sous Chef, Doug Grigg is celebrating after winning a place in the Best Dressed Irish Oyster Competition 2019.</p>
      <p>Doug said: "Over the years we have grown - but we are quirky as ever. Now we've got the wood fire outside and the full barbecue as well."</p>
      <p>In the tense live London final Doug impressed the demanding panel of judges - including a professional ‘ostrelier’ - with his entertaining and creative hot and cold dishes. <br/>Doug was the only finalist allowed to compete in both the hot and cold oyster categories against chefs from leading seafood restaurants across the British Isles.</p>
      <h3>These were Doug's two award-winning dishes:</h3>

      <p>‘An Irishman in Havana - Tobacco &amp; Whisky’ was inspired by an Irish Aristocrat visiting Havana and featured sweet rum cask-finished Irish whiskey accompanied by the smoky aroma of Cuban cigar.</p>

        <b>The wild Irish coastline was Doug's inspiration for his hot oyster dish...</b>

      <p>‘Open Sea’ was inspired by the Irish coast line, with ingredients including Japanese bonito flakes, seaweed, fish sauce, panko breadcrumb and savoy cabbage, and was described as ‘beautiful’ by the judges.<br/>The 12 Best Dressed Irish Oyster finalists in the UK were: <br/><br/><b>Hot Category</b></p>

      <p>(Winner) Dean Parker, Head Chef, Darby’s <br/> </p>
      <p>This year’s competition was particularly tough, leaving the judges unable to name a single winner. Instead, Dean Parker from Darby’s and Simon Lamont from Seabird, London, took the crown of Best Dressed Irish Oyster 2019.</p>
      <p>Donal Denvir, General Manager at Bord Bia (the Irish Food Board) added: "This year’s competition really set the bar high and we were overwhelmed by the number of entries that we received from some of the UK’s top seafood restaurants.”</p>
