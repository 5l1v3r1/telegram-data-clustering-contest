      <p>Madrid - Serbia's <b>Davis Cup </b>captain Nenad Zimonjic was optimistic on Sunday that world number two <b>Novak Djokovic</b> will be fit to play in this week's new look Davis Cup in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Djokovic lost to Roger Federer on Thursday, missing out on a place in the ATP Finals semi-finals in London, revealing afterwards that he had been suffering pain in his elbow.</p>
      <p>"Everything seems okay now," said Zimonjic.</p>
      <p>"He will have his first practice since that match today (Sunday) so we'll find out. As of now, eveything is okay."</p>
      <p>Djokovic suffered a shoulder problem at the US Open in September but recovered from it to win in Tokyo and Paris.</p>
      <p>"I think it's going to be enough time for him to prepare for our first match which is going to be on Wednesday," said Zimonjic.</p>
      <p>Serbia open their campaign against Japan on Wednesday morning before meeting France in their second group match 24 hours later.</p>
      <p>The Davis Cup's new 18-team format has replaced the former World Group.</p>
      <p>The nations have been split into six three-team groups, with the winners and two best runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals.</p>
