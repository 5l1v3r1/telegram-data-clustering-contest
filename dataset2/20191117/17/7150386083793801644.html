      <p>Opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz hit a brilliant 52-ball 79 as <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> claimed the three-match T20I series 2-1 with a comprehensive 29-run win over the West Indies in the third game here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Batting first after winning the toss, Afghanistan posted a competitive 156 for 8, courtesy Gurbaz’s superb innings.</p>
      <p>Asghar Afghan (24 off 20), Najibullah Zadran (14 off 14) and Mohammad Nabi (15 off 7) were the other contributors.</p>
      <p>Shai Hope, who was called in as cover for the injured Dinesh Ramdin, then made a 46 ball off 52 but he didn’t get enough support from the other end as Afghanistan restricted West Indies to 127 for 7 to complete the win.</p>
      <p>Chasing 157 to win, West Indies lost Lendl Simmons (7) and Brandon King (1) early to be reduced to 16 for two.</p>
      <p>Evin Lewis (24) was then dismissed LBW by Karim Janat (24).</p>
      <p>Hope and Shimron Hetmyer (11) tried to steady the innings, adding 38 but the latter was removed by Rashid Khan in the 13th over.</p>
      <p>Skipper Pollard then joined Hope as the duo brought up the team hundred in the 16th over but they failed to push the score.</p>
      <p>Hope completed his fifty in the 17th over but Pollard was holed out in the next over as WI lost their fifth wicket.</p>
      <p>The equation came down to 39 off 12 balls, which proved too much for the West Indies lower-order following the dismissal of Hope in the 19th over.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Gurbaz slammed six fours and five sixes in his 52-ball knock to almost single-handedly take Afghanistan to a good score.</p>
      <p>For West Indies, Sheldon Cottrell (2/29), Kesrick Williams (2/31) and Keemo Paul (2/26) snapped two wickets each, while Kieron Pollard took one.</p>
