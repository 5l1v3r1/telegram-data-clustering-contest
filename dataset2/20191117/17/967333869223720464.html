      <p>Several Middle Eastern countries have expressed interest in Russia's S-400 air defence system, a representative from Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation said on Sunday.</p>
      <blockquote>"Several countries from the Middle East have expressed interest in the [S-400] systems. We will look into the requests made by foreign entities into these systems", company spokeswoman Maria Vorobyova said at the Dubai Airshow 2019, which started on Sunday.</blockquote>
      <p>Vorobyeva added that Russia and Riyadh are currently discussing terms for a 2017 deal the two sides signed on the delivery of Russian S-400 air defence systems to Saudi Arabia, to go into effect.</p>
      <blockquote>"[Russia] and Saudi Arabia signed a deal in 2017 for the delivery of S-400 'Triumph' [air defence systems]. Currently, we are discussing with our partners mutually agreed-upon conditions for the deal to go into effect", Maria Vorobyeva said.</blockquote>
      <p>This year, Russia completed the delivery of all components of the S-400 air defence missile systems to Turkey. According to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, the S-400 will be fully operational in April 2020.</p>
