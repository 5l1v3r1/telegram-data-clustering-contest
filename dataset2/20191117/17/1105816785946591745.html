      <p><b>RAWALPINDI: </b>Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Sunday said the present government would respect the decision of the Lahore High Court regarding former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s departure abroad for four weeks to get medical treatment.</p>
      <p>“The decision of the court should not be considered as defeat or victory of anyone,” he said while inaugurating Steam Engine Safari Train from Rawalpindi to Attock.</p>
      <p>The minister said Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif signed an undertaking which stated that both would return back to Pakistan within the given time to the court.    He categorically stated that no one played a role to send Nawaz abroad rather it was purely the decision of the Lahore High Court.</p>
      <p>Rashid said the good days are coming in the country’s politics, adding, the political scenario would change till January 15, 2020. He said JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman took a wise and timely decision of terminating Islamabad sit-in.</p>

      <p>“The timings of decisions matter a lot in war and politics, Fazl did not choose the right time for his protest,” affirmed Rashid, adding that Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, was emerging as one of the popular destinations for tourists.</p>
      <p>He said Pakistan is a beautiful and a picturesque country with its cultural diversity and ancient civilization.</p>
      <p>“Steps are being taken to control inflation and provide job opportunities to the youth,” Rashid added as he implied that the major reason behind price hike was corruption of the past rulers.</p>
      <p>The federal minister condemned the recent incident of fire explosion in a train and thanked ‘Tableeghi Jamaat’ for imposing ban on its participants of ‘Ijtema’ to carry gas stoves during the journeys.</p>
      <p>He reiterated that the present government was taking all possible measures to ensure the provision of comfortable, modern, swift and safe means of transportation to the passengers.</p>
      <p>It has also been decided to commence Railway ML-1 project for development of Pakistan Railways. Under the mega initiative, a new track of 1874 km from Peshawar to Karachi will be laid and the present track, with its complete restoration, will be upgraded according to the modern needs.</p>
      <p>Rashid cited the completion of project in three major phases</p>
      <p>He further told that under the ML-1 project, new mega dry port will be built at Havelian and the main railway workshop of Walton Lahore will be upgraded. In the first project , the cost will be $2.38 billion. Five feet fencing will  be installed  on both sides of the railway track from Karachi to Lahore  to abolish crossing of every kind. At least 2,800 railway barricades will be abolished  and relapsed by the underground passage ways. From this project, 1,60,000 persons will get employment too.</p>
      <p>He further informed that PM Imran Khan and the Chinese leadership will inaugurate the mega project jointly and the ceremony of the inauguration is expected in four months; however the announcement of the final date will be in December.</p>
      <p>Currently, a total of 136 passenger and 55 freight trains are operating in Pakistan.</p>
