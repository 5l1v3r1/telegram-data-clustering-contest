        <b>Over his more than 2.5-year tenure in office as the President of the United States, Donald Trump has on numerous occasions sent the Internet community reeling with a number of spelling mistakes in his tweets and slips of the tongue in his public speeches.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US President on Sunday blessed Twitter with yet another puzzling word in a reply to a post by real estate mogul and TV personality Katrina Campins.</p>
      <p>The president reacted to Campins' tweet, in which she praised American attorney and politician Pam Bondi.</p>
      <p>Trump apparently wanted to express similar feelings towards Bondi, but his typing skills <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910081076989199-stolwhat-trump-fails-to-recall-nato-chiefs-name/">must have let him</a> down as he ended up tweeting that she is a 'great womem'.</p>
