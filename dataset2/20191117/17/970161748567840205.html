        <b>Michael van Gerwen suffered a shock 16-12 defeat to Gerwyn Price in the semi-finals of the Grand Slam of Darts, but has taken the disappointing loss on the chin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world number one had never lost to the Iceman in 19 previous meetings, but succumbed to the defending champion in Wolverhampton on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>MVG turned in an impressive performance, averaging 101.91, but missed double cost him and the Welshman’s fantastic doubling saw him down the world champ for the first time.</p>
      <p>Van Gerwen was magnanimous in defeat, giving his opponent a hug on the stage, and then posting a classy tweet soon after the match.</p>
      <p>‘All I can say is Gerwyn deserved to win,’ Van Gerwen tweeted. ‘I made too many mistakes and gave him too many chances. Today he took advantage and credit is to him for that.</p>

      <p>‘Today it hurts not to take the trophy home but tomorrow I start to prepare for the next tournament where I will put it right.’</p>

      <p>That next tournament is the Players Championship Finals in Minehead next weekend, the final event before the World Championship gets underway on 13 December in London.</p>
      <p>Price now has the chance to retain the trophy he won last year and claim only a second major title in the PDC.</p>
      <p>The win over MVG has already seen the Welshman rise to his highest position ever on the PDC Order of Merit as he overtakes Michael Smith at number three in the world.</p>
      <p>Van Gerwen’s place at world number one remains extremely safe, though, with a lead of over £500,000 over Rob Cross who is in second spot.</p>
      <p>Price takes on Peter Wright in the final of the Grand Slam on Sunday evening at 7pm after Snakebite beat Glen Durrant 16-11 in the first semi-final.</p>
      <p>Durrant tweeted his own reaction to his loss, expressing his disappointment, but acknowledging that this would be the last time he appears in a tournament representing the BDO.</p>

      <p>‘Gutted. But thank you @BDOdarts and goodbye – Thanks for the memories,’ tweeted Duzza.</p>
