      <p>A mum is "disgusted" after claiming Christmas presents sent by her son via Hermes were already "open" when they arrived - and in different packaging to what they had been been sent in.</p>
      <p>Kerryann Mcildoon, of Hull East Yorkshire, said the package sent by her son Daryl, who lives in Luton, Bedfordshire was not delivered on Tuesday as planned.</p>
      <p>When he contacted Hermes, he was told the label was damaged so it was not delivered, and it was instead going to going to arrive on Thursday.</p>
      <p>When the package arrived, Mrs Mcildoon claims she was devastated to find the opened presents and said they arrived in a box with a label on for a "shower greyhound coat" and not in the Royal Mail box it had been sent in, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/hermes-delivery-christmas-presents-disgusted-3543267">Hull Live reports.</a></p>

      <p>"He sent me my Christmas presents through Hermes, the couriers. He phones me on Tuesday and said you should receive the parcel between 10am and 2pm.</p>
      <p>"He [my son] said did you get the parcel? I said, no I didn't get the parcel.</p>
      <p>"[he was told] The label was damaged on the box so they couldn't deliver it.</p>
      <p>"My son phoned on Thursday morning and said your parcel is coming today.</p>
