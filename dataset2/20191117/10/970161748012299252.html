        <b>Omarion has finally broken his silence on the controversy surrounding his B2K bandmate Fizz <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> his ex-girlfriend Apryl Jones, and he’s taking the high road stating they deserve to be ‘happy’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everyone from B2K fans to Meek Mill have had an opinion on the scandal since Fizz, 33, and Apryl, 32, went public with their romance in an episode of Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood last month.</p>
      <p>Their relationship has caused a stir as Omarion, 35, shares two children with Apryl – son Megaa, five, and daughter A’mei, three. He and Fizz, real name Dreux Frederic, have also known each other since childhood after rising to super stardom with boy band B2K in the early noughties.</p>
      <p>Since confirming their relationship, Apryl and Fizz haven’t been subtle about their affections sharing cosy photos together on Instagram and intimate videos.</p>

      <p>Those gripped by the scandal have been waiting for Omarion to comment but he’s seemed completely unbothered by the situation, maintaining a wall of silence until now.</p>
      <p>Omarion spoke out on the situation for the first time in an interview with Vlad TV this weekend, and said: ‘I don’t feel no ways, I don’t feel any way about it.</p>
      <p>‘I think that if they’re happy, then they should be happy.’</p>

      <p>In reference to their social media antics, he added: ‘I think they should change the narrative, though.’</p>
      <p>Omarion, who split from Apryl in 2016, continued: ‘She’s still the mother of my children. When something affects her, it affects my kids, and that affects me.</p>
      <p>‘But what she does is, you know, live your life. I think people should do whatever makes them happy. I think they should change the narrative though because if it’s their so-called happiness, I shouldn’t be a part of it.’</p>
      <p>When Vlad asked Omarion about a video of Fizz intimately touching Apryl in a video, the singer responded: ‘Well, I guess that’s what couples do.’</p>

      <p>Omarion agreed with Fizz that they have more of a working relationship than a close friendship, stating: ‘I guess so. Yes, we do.’</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘What we established as kids, the B2K brand coming back 15 years later this year to have one of the biggest tours of the year, there’s nothing that could touch that.</p>

      <p>‘That’s history in itself. Just speaking personally, I don’t think that matters. We were able to give the fans what they wanted for so many years. That’s what’s up right there.’</p>
      <p>The situation is made all the more awkward by the fact B2K, which also includes members J-Boog and Raz-B, have been performing on their Millennium Tour since they reunited for the first time in 15 years in 2018.</p>
      <p>Fans are expecting the Bump Bump Bump hitmakers to tour worldwide next year, including Europe, but the situation between Omarion and Fizz has cast uncertainty over the plans.</p>
