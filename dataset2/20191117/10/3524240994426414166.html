      <p>Lionel Messi may be the darling of Barcelona and king of the Nou Camp, but he once sought out a Real Madrid star for a shirt swap.</p>
      <p>Opponents often clamour to swap shirts with the Argentine, but he was once in their shoes.</p>
      <p>Messi admits how he rarely seeks out players to swap shirts, but did so with Zinedine Zidane.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman, now in charge at the Bernabeu, was in the twilight years of his career when Messi was beginning to blossom.</p>
      <p>But after years of watching the World Cup winner broadcast his skills at the highest level the Barcelona star could not resist asking for his shirt.</p>
      <p>“I don’t ask for shirts, I usually swap them, but I asked Zidane once,” Messi told <i>TyC Sport</i>.</p>
      <p>“If there is an Argentine, I swap with him. Unless someone asks me, I’m not asking anyone.”</p>
      <p>Messi is eyeing a sixth Ballon d’Or later this year having led Barcelona to another La Liga title.</p>
      <p>He was absent for the start of the season, but has hit the ground running with eight goals in his seven matches.</p>
      <p>But there are fears Messi may walk away from the Nou Camp after it emerged there was a clause in his contract which allowed him to leave at the end of the season.</p>
