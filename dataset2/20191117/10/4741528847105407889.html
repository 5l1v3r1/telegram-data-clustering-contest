      <p>The Federal Government has set aside the sum of $1.6 billion for the development of two seaports in the South- South region to help decongest the Lagos Ports, according to the <a href="https://punchng.com/fg-okays-1-6bn-new-ph-warri-ports/">Punch</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The Details</b>: Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi disclosed that the sum of $800 million each was devoted to the two seaports earmarked for construction. He also stated that the ports will be constructed in the Pessu area of Delta State, and Bonny area of Rivers State respectively.</p>
      <p>This disclosure was made at an empowerment program targeted at empowering 1,700 women and youths in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State. Amaechi made this statement in the company of Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo.</p>
      <p><b>Amaechi words:</b> “<i>The Federal Government is set to build a new seaport in </i><i>Pessu</i><i> and a similar one in Bonny in the Bonny Local Government Area of Rivers State. The seaport (project) will gulp $800m each</i>.”</p>
      <p>Amaechi advised the youths to allow the project run smoothly, noting that the seaports were a huge investment.</p>

      <p>“<i>When you stop them from working, you are losing such a huge investment where the entire community can be contractors; some can supply sand</i>,” he said.</p>
      <p>“<i>The best thing to do is to allow the development. Imagine the companies that have left Warri; let the seaport project go on smoothly</i>.” he advised.</p>
      <p><b>Minister of State for Labour</b> and Employment noted that President Muhammadu Buhari is going to deliver on all his promises of lifting several Nigerians out of poverty. He pointed out that Niger Deltans will benefit from these empowerment schemes still to come.</p>
      <p>Some of the materials given to participants in the empowerment scheme programme ranged from cash, sewing machines, to knitting machines and welding machines.</p>
      <p><b>In a recent </b><b>Nairametric</b>s article, President Muhammadu Buhari said that at least <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/08/02/we-lifted-five-million-nigerians-out-of-extreme-poverty-buhari/">five million Nigerians have been alleviated from extreme poverty</a> since he assumed office in 2015.</p>
      <p>According to him, the National Social Investment Programme has assisted his administration in creating two million job opportunities in the last three years, and as a result of the initiative, five million Nigerians have been lifted from extreme poverty.</p>
      <p>This was after it was reported that Nigerians have become poorer during his administration.</p>
