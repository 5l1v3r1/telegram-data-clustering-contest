      <h1>England predicted line-up for final Euro 2020 qualifier with Kosovo</h1>
      <h2>England face Kosovo in Pristina on Sunday evening in their final Euro 2020 qualifier. Raheem Sterling is set to return to the starting XI with the Three Lions already qualified</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:12:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate will restore Raheem Sterling to the England starting XI for the Three Lions' final Euro 2020 qualifying clash with Kosovo.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star Sterling was omitted from England's 7-0 victory over Montenegro on Thursday night after an altercation with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Sterling had a bust-up with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Gomez last week in the canteen which required them to be separated by teammates, while Jordan Henderson was brought in to mediate.</p>
      <p>Despite Sterling's return, having watched from the stands at Wembley, Gomez has been forced to return to Merseyside following an injury picked up in training.</p>

      <p>Southgate believes the incident is now closed.</p>
      <p>"You couldn't make it up if you tried!" Southgate said. "He's absolutely fine. He had a clash of knees yesterday. We scanned it just to be certain and I think he'll be fine in a couple of days," Southgate said.</p>
      <p>"But he wasn't able to train today so it was a simple decision. Now is a good moment for him to go home for a couple of days and clear his head.</p>

      <p>"The pleasing thing for me is that we got him back on the pitch. The tweet that Raheem put out the other night was real closure on the whole incident.</p>
      <p>"We get Raheem back on the pitch tomorrow. We won the match on Thursday and we can now just look forward.</p>
      <p>"We actually ended up had a chuckle this morning at the ridiculousness of the way he's had to go home in the end.</p>
      <p>"He's had a difficult week, as you say, but it's one that will make him stronger and one that he's dealt with really well."</p>
      <p>England have already qualified for next season's tournament, where they will host three group games, and the match in Pristina will provide audition time for plenty of Euro hopefuls.</p>
      <p>The likes of Harry Winks, Tyrone Mings and Tammy Abraham will all hope to start, but James Maddison, who made his debut last week, is a doubt with a calf strain.</p>
