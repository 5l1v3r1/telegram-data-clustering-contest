      <h3>ANDREA Brillantes and Seth Fedelin comprise the SethDrea teen love team that started in “Kadenang Ginto”. Now, Dreamscape gives them the chance to cross over and star in their own movie, “Wild Little Love”, to be shown in iWant streaming, directed by Benedict Mique. They are supported in it by Carmina Villaroel, Aflred Vargas, Victor Neri and Jin Macapagal. What can they say that they are being predicted to replace the KathNiel love team, what with Seth looking like a young Daniel Padilla?</h3>
      <p>“E, sana nga maging totoo,” says Andrea. “Matagal na po akong fan ng KatNiel, e. Kaya lang, hindi naman namin sila mapapalitan. I’m sure nandiyan pa rin sila. Sana lang, maabot namin kung ano ang inabot nila sa showbiz.”</p>
      <p>Director Benedict Mique said Andrea really prayed for someone like Seth to come into her life. Is this true? “Ibinuking naman ako ni DIrek but yes, its true. Ipinagdasal ko pong magkaroon sana ako ng isang Daniel na ka-love team at ayan, ibinigay naman siya sa akin.”</p>
      <p>So, like KathNiel, they will also end up in each other’s arms in real life? “Ay, tungkol doon, hindi po natin masasabi.  Sa ngayon, basta trabaho muna. Sa age namin ngayon, basta enjoy lang.”</p>
      <p>“Kung kami naman talaga ang magiging para sa isa’t isa, e di sige, but as of now, no one can tell kasi sobrang bata pa po kami,” says Seth.</p>
      <p>In “Wild Little Love”, Andrea plays Samantha or Sam, a spoiled, unruly rich girl whose parents, Alfred and Carmina, cannot control. To give her a lesson, her dad transfers her to a public high school where she meets totally different people compared to the rich exclusive school she went to before.</p>
      <p>This is where she meets Seth as Jake, a poor boy who will teach her to how adjust to her new surroundings and how to accept the rewards of having a more simple life.  As they become very close to each other, they would realize that the huge gap between their widely different social status in life can prevent them from having a satisfying romantic relationship. The movie will start streaming on November 23, but there is a Facebook poll to determine which movie will be shown first, that of Seth and Andrea or “Silly Red Shoes” of Kyle Echarri and Francine Diaz. You have up to November 22 to vote for the movie that you want to support and see first.</p>
