      <p>BEIRUT: As the Lebanese revolution celebrates the end of its first month, it also celebrates the beginning of a new chapter in Lebanese history- that of unity, solidarity, and resilience. Never before did millions of Lebanese nationals unite for the joint welfare of their country, and this wave of steadfast, collective, patriotism is reshaping the nation.“One month ago, the life of every Lebanese was turned upside down. Lebanese flags became our instruments of change as we finally decided to claim our country back from the corrupt politicians who’ve been tarnishing the image of our country for the past 30 years,” Amal Hamasny told Annahar. Her 20-year-old daughter then added that “my parents used to be the biggest supporters of a specific political party, but the sight of people abandoning their political affiliations that only served to create further divisions in the country made them rethink their priorities, and now they’re here protesting with me every day!” After one month, protesters are proud of the revolution’s accomplishments to date, including the renunciation of four ministers from cabinet on the 3rd day, the resignation of the Prime Minister on the 13th day, along with the resolute resistance and activism observed by thousands of high school and university students around the country. However, they do acknowledge that these are nothing but minor changes preceding significant political amendments and a major restructuring process potentially yet to come. “I’m very optimistic about Lebanon’s future because the new generation is aware of the country’s socio-political situation and we refuse to submit to the rule of such a corrupt government; Lebanon will improve because we won’t settle for any other alternative,” Yasmina Charaf, a Lebanese law student living in Switzerland who’s already participated in 2 protests organized in her country, told Annahar.Maintaining peace and harmony whilst minimizing instances of violence is a rarity during a revolution, but the Lebanese people have succeeded in their administering of peaceful civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. “I must admit it saddens me to know that some people still look at the protesters as their enemies instead of considering them their allies, but a lot of changes are yet to come,” Shireen Khazaal, a fresh AUB graduate, told Annahar.She then explained how after one month of participating in the demonstrations, she believes the new government to be formed will be composed of dedicated, ethical, and patriotic politicians whose main goal is to serve the country and not promote corruption and embezzlement of public funds. “I can’t believe it’s been a month already, and while some politicians still refuse to acknowledge the nature of ourdemands, we will never submit to the government’s intransigence. Even if it takes us several more months, we will not leave these streets before we eradicate the corrupt authorities,” Amer Mahfouz, a cab driver, said.One month is but the first chapter of the burgeoning Lebanese revolution whose chain of events is slowly unfolding to reveal unprecedented changes. History will document how vigorous Lebanese protesters once united under the same colors- red, white, and green.
