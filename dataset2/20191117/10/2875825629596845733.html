      <p>Artem Lobov has lost to Jason Knight in the main event of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship 9.</p>
      <p>The Russian Hammer was stopped in the fifth and final round in the early hours of Sunday morning Irish time.</p>
      <p>Lobov defeated Knight in April, but the American got revenge in his home state of Mississippi.</p>
      <p>Lobov suffered a bad cut to his left eye and couldn't get back up after Knight connected with that eye again in the last round.</p>
      <p>Both men hinted at a trilogy fight after the bout, with Lobov sayng he couldn't really remember the second or third round.</p>
      <p>He said: "I couldn't really see anything.</p>
      <p>"After a loss it's never a good time to plan your future. Everything feels like s***. You don't want to do anything so it's not a good time.</p>
      <p>"It's very emotional."</p>
      <p>Knight added: "I love that guy [Lobov]. He had a lot of respect for me and I got the same respect for him. I love that man.</p>
      <p>"Anytime he's not fighting me, I'm going to be rooting him on and anytime he gets ready to come here and do it a third time I'm down."</p>
