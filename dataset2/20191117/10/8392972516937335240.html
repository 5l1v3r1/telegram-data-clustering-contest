      <h1>Ant McPartlin pinpoints Katie Hopkins as his 'least favourite' I'm A Celebrity contestant</h1>
      <h2>"She didn't really shine," TV host reflects</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:09:42+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Ant McPartlin is "very excited" to be returning to host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> with his presenting partner <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">43-year-old TV star</a> was replaced on the ITV reality show last year by Holly Willoughby, after he took time away from the spotlight to enter rehab following a drink driving conviction.</p>
      <p>But he's due back on the box alongside Dec to welcome the latest group of celebrities into the Australian jungle tonight - and he couldn't be happier.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a>: "I'm very, very excited about getting back on the show. It's a brilliant place to work and a brilliant part of the world to be in. Plus, I'm back with my best friend. I can't wait."</p>

      <p>This year sees the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Nadine Coyle, and Ian Wright take part, with Dec, 44, has dubbed them as "one of the best casts in years".</p>
      <p>Asked what they're most looking forward to about this series, Dec said: "The cast. We've been privy to a few of the names taking part this year. We're very, very excited as it's one of the best casts in years.</p>
      <aside>She didn't really shine.</aside>
      <p>"It's a time of year we really look forward to and we love being in Australia. This will be our 19th series and it's a show we absolutely love doing."</p>
      <p>However, while reflecting on the various famous faces to have gone to Oz for the long-running series over the years, Ant seemed to make a slight dig at former contestant Katie Hopkins.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Asked about their least favourite celebrity campmate, Dec pointed out Gillian McKeith's histrionic approach to Bushtucker trials could be frustrating.</p>
      <p>He also noted that the least entertaining stars are those who are not very memorable - leading to Ant's dismissal of 2007 contestant Katie.</p>
      <p>"You wouldn't really remember her doing it, as she didn't really shine," he said of the ex Apprentice contestant who has gone on to become a polarising figure on social media.</p>
      <p>Last year's series of the jungle reality show saw football manager Harry Redknapp crowned King of the Jungle.</p>
