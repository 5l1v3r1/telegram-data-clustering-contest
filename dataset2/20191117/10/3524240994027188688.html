      <p>Ex-model and actress, Ufuoma McDermott, is one damsel who has been able to sustain her relevance in Nollywood. In an industry where friendships hardly endure tough times, Ufuoma’s friendship with her colleagues – Omoni Oboli, Uche Jombo and Chioma Akpotha – has lasted for a long time.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Sunday Scoop, the actress revealed how to sustain friendship in Nollywood.</p>
      <p>She said, “What we feel for each other is care and love. If you love someone, you look out for them. I don’t know if I have ever sat back and drawn a plan, saying this person is going to be my friend. It just happens; your spirit just flows with certain kinds of people. You allow them into your inner circle. It is something that just happens, it is not planned.”</p>
      <p>Explaining how she has been able to achieve a balance between being an actress, a wife and a mother, McDermott said, “It’s the same way with doctors who have to go out for days and weeks. Even teachers can be transferred. At the end of the day, balancing your family is dependent on you as a person, what you consider your priority and how you plan your life.”</p>
      <p>Addressing the question about how she has been able to stay relevant, she said, “I dare say that I am one of the most successful actors there is. I have constantly sought to up my dexterity as an actor; for me, that is success. I have been able to interpret roles I am super proud of. I have roles on a platter based on previous performances.”</p>
      <p>Speaking further, the filmmaker added that she had never been under pressure to fit in as a public figure.</p>
      <p>“It’s a case of to each their own; you will feel pressured if you want to be pressured. So I don’t feel any pressure. I am a working actor; I am not a social media actor. I act for real. Acting is my day job, so I am like the banker who gets up in the morning, goes to the bank, finishes from the bank and goes home. It’s the same for me. If I am on a movie set, I go do my job and I go home. I don’t feel any pressure as long as I don’t put it on myself,” she said.</p>
