      <p>In a new chat for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/emmerdale-star-michelle-hardwick-says-20895743">Sunday Mirror</a>, Michelle spoke about the relationship for the couple and let slip the wedding is very much still on.</p>
      <p>She said: "If Emmerdale weddings are anything to go by, it can't just go smoothly, can it? I'd be very shocked if it did."</p>
      <p>The couple split up last week when Vanessa discovered Charity had lied to her about the casino scam and tried to buy a house without her knowledge.</p>
      <p>After Charity swore the money she had was from hard work and wasn't at all dodgy, the pair agreed to buy the house together.</p>
      <p>But Vinny soon ruined their plans and kept hinting to Vanessa that Charity was involved in a scam.</p>
      <p>Vanessa gave Charity the chance to come clean, but she didn't.</p>

      <p>Furious with her fiancée for lying, Vanessa broke off their engagement, ending their relationship, as well as outing Charity's involvement in the scam to the rest of the Dingles.</p>
      <p>It left Vanity fans heartbroken and they flocked to Twitter to share their emotional reactions.</p>
