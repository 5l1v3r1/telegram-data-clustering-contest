      <h1>Prince Andrew's Epstein Interview 'A Plane Crashing Into An Oil Tanker'</h1>
      <h2>LONDON (AP) – British media have slammed Prince Andrew´s effort to rebut claims that he had sex with a woman who says she was trafficked as a teenager by Jeffrey Epstein, branding the interview a public relations disaster.</h2>

      <p>In a rare interview with BBC Newsnight broadcast Saturday, Andrew categorically denied having sex with the woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. But Britain´s newspapers and social media commentators are criticizing him for still defending his friendship with Epstein and failing to show sympathy for the convicted sex offender’s victims.</p>

      <p>Even some who closely follow the Royal Family, such as the editor of the Royal Central website, offered more shock than sympathy. Charlie Proctor wrote on Twitter: “I expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion-level bad.”</p>
