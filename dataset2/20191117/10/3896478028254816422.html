      <h2>White House senior officials, who spoke with their Israeli counterparts, say the president distanced himself from Israel's leader because he 'doesn't like losers'</h2>

      <p>The U.S. government feels “frustrated” and “disappointed” with Israeli politics in general and with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in particular, according to senior White House officials who spoke with their Israeli counterparts on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>"Americans are discouraged and frustrated by Israeli politics and the current political crisis, which has prevented the White House from unveiling the political part of the deal of the century," said White House sources, referring to the Trump administration’s long-delayed Mideast peace plan.</p>

      <p>The sources added that President Donald Trump has in the past admitted to feeling “very disappointed” with Netanyhau and has spoken about him in a negative manner.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Trump has decided to distance himself from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after his failure to secure a clear victory in the April 9 elections and form a government, despite the assistance Israel’s leader received from the president. “The president doesn’t like losers,” said a White House source.”</p>
      <p>Before the April 9 vote, Netanyahu was invited to the White House, where Trump officially recognized the Golan Heights as Israel’s sovereign territory and designated Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>
      <p>During the election campaign ahead of the September 17 vote, however, Trump’s behavior toward Netanyahu has changed.</p>

      <p>He’d written no blank checks for Netanyahu during that campaign and made no loud statements or promises. The only notable thing being a tweet, where Trump vowed to form a security alliance with Israel.</p>
      <p>In addition, Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was fired by Trump a year into the job, said two months ago during an event at Harvard University that Netanyahu “played” Trump on several occasions by providing him with incorrect information.</p>
      <p>"In dealing with Bibi, it's always useful to carry a healthy amount of skepticism in your discussions with him," he was quoted as saying. “It bothers me that an ally that's that close and important to us would do that to us.”</p>
