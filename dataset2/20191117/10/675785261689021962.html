      <p>Ian Wright has explained that appearing on Match of the Day is his "Graceland" after his abusive step-father wouldn't let him watch the football highlights show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> legend Wright, who is set to enter the I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! jungle on Sunday night, opened up on how the famous jaunty theme music would leave him with a pain in his chest.</p>
      <p>Wright’s father absconded and left mother Nesta to raise her family in a one-bedroom house in Brockley, South London.</p>
      <p>His step-dad was cruel to Wright, with the ex-England striker sharing an emotional story about how he was only allowed to listen, but not watch, Match of the Day on Saturday nights.</p>

      <p>"He was a weed-smoking, gambling, coming-home-late, gambling-his-wages, womanising kind of guy,” Wright told the <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/ian-wright-earning-my-smile">Players' Tribune.</a></p>
      <p>"He was rough with my mum and rough with all of us kids. And I don’t know why, but he didn’t like me in particular.</p>
      <p>"One of the few things my brother and I looked forward to in the house was Match of the Day, and my stepdad used to take that away from us – just because he could.</p>

      <p>"Depending on what mood he was in, he’d come into the bedroom just before it started and he’d say, ‘Turn around. Turn around to the wall.’</p>
      <p>"We had to face the wall the whole time Match of the Day was on. And the really cruel thing was that we could still hear everything. It was awful. I would cry myself to sleep whenever he did it.</p>
      <p>"I carried that with me for years. Whenever I heard the Match of the Day theme music come on, I would feel that pain in my chest. And I’ll be honest with you, it still gets to me every now and again."</p>
      <p>Wright would go on to become a regular on the BBC program, following his successful playing career, but it is his first appearance, under the stewardship of Des Lynam that left him almost in tears.</p>
      <p>He added: "The first time I went on the show as a presenter, Des Lynam walked up to me and said, ‘Ian Wright, welcome to Match of the Day'.</p>
      <p>"I nearly broke down crying. I told Des, 'This is my Graceland.'"</p>
