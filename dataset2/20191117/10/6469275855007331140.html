        <b>Chorley ended a 10-game winless run with this well-deserved victory over a Chesterfield side beaten only once in their last seven National League matches.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grimsby Town loanee Charles Vernam was the Magpies’ matchwinner with a brace of goals including a penalty but this was essentially a fine team effort which caused the home fans in a crowd of 4,090 no end of frustration.</p>
      <p>Only the second Chorley win in what has been a torrid campaign to date, it was built on a strong start and a two-goal lead secured in the opening 19 minutes. Vernam opened his account on 16 minutes, controlling a clever ball over the top from the excellent Martin Smith before promptly firing unerringly past keeper Shwan Jalal.</p>
      <p>Smith was again the provider three minutes later, hoisting a free-kick to the far side of the home penalty area where Courtney Meppen-Walters rose above his marker to power a header in-off the post into the net. Not surprisingly, Chesterfield mounted early second-half pressure, Urwin doing well to punch clear from a dangerous corner, but Marcus Carver was very close with a strong effort which flew just over the bar following great link-up play between Alex Newby and Vernam.</p>
      <p>However, Chesterfield pulled a goal back in the 68th minute from a cracking strike by Weston who gave Urwin no chance with a fierce shot into the top corner of the net. And Urwin had to be vigilant in turning over a Jay Sherdian free-kick as the hosts fought to equalise.</p>
      <p>Vernam’s spot-kick on 74 minutes eased the pressure on the visitors. Having robbed Will Evans of the ball and advanced into the box, he was clumsily brought down by the defender.</p>
      <p>Vernam converted the penalty himself with a minimum of fuss. Eight minutes from time Chesterfield reduced the arrears to set up a nerve-jangling finish. The Magpies survived desperate late efforts by the hosts to salvage a point.</p>
      <p>Urwin saved brilliantly from Boden, and Meppen-Walters and Lewis Baines both crucially headed clear from corners as Chorley successfully saw out the game for a first away win.</p>
      <p>CHORLEY : Urwin, Challoner, Blakeman (Cottrell,69), Meppen-Walters, A. Newby (O’Keefe,75), Carver, Ross, Smith, Baines, Nortey, Vernam (Dodds,83). Unused subs. E.Newby, Massanka.</p>
      <p>Att. 4,090.</p>
