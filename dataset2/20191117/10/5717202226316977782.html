      <h1>Everton must use Cenk Tosun to bring in striker target Goncalo Paciencia</h1>
      <h2>Everton’s Turkish striker came through the ranks with the German side.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:45:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Everton are reportedly interested in a deal for Eintracht Frankfurt striker Goncalo Paciencia.<a href="https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/detalhe/goncalo-paciencia-na-mira-do-everton"> Record </a>and <a href="https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/detalhe/goncalo-paciencia-na-mira-do-everton">Goal</a> are both reporting Everton as being keen on the Portugal international, who is valued in the region of €20 million (£17.1m). </p>
      <p>Paciencia has been in fine form for the German club this season, stepping up to replace Luka Jovic who left for Real Madrid in a big-money summer transfer. </p>
      <p>But whilst the early estimates put Frankfurt’s asking price at £17.1 million, the Bundesliga side are earning a reputation for driving a hard bargain. It seems that price-tag could be low for a player of Paciencia’s ability and age. </p>

      <p>One way Everton could bring the price down would be to include a player in the deal. It just so happens that they have a player Frankfurt are interested in. </p>
      <p>The player in question is Cenk Tosun and he was linked with Frankfurt in the summer. </p>
      <p><a href="https://fussball.news/artikel/bobic-sucht-neuen-stuermer-werden-keine-dummheiten-machen/">As reported by Fussball.News</a>, the Bundesliga side were considering a potential deal for the Everton player in August. Tosun, who was born in Germany, actually came through the youth system at Frankfurt and played one Bundesliga game for the club in 2010.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wiesbadener-kurier.de/sport/fussball/eintracht-frankfurt/eintracht-kuss-aufs-wappen-kein-garantieschein_20350979#">Speaking to Wiesbadener Kurier</a>, Tosun even confirmed contact with the German side over a move. However, he insisted he was happy at Everton and Frankfurt eventually signed Bas Dost from Sporting Lisbon instead. </p>
      <p>Frankfurt, therefore, have an interest in Tosun, who has struggled at Goodison Park and would surely be interested in a deal which saw the Turkish international heading back to his home state to ply his trade. </p>
      <p>Everton should certainly consider it as an option as they try to bring Paciencia to Merseyside.</p>
