        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Board games are one of my favorite things in the world. There’s something about sitting around your cozy home or, even better, in a gorgeous pub and gaming for a few hours — especially considering how long we spend staring at screens these days.</p>
      <p>I’ve got nothing against playing video games, quite the opposite in fact, but a board game is so much more communal than everyone packed around a screen.</p>
      <p>But, there’s a problem. What if you want a game that’s more laid back? Where you don’t have to compete with everyone? Or do your best to crush your opponents? What if you just want to have a Nice Time?</p>
      <p>Then, do we have a board game for you: Pandemic.</p>
      <p>Oh, and would you believe it??? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Z-Man-Games-ZM7101-Pandemic/dp/B00A2HD40E/?tag=tnw88-20">It currently has a whopping 40 percent of its retail price</a>, meaning you can pick up this badgal for only $24. A total bargain.</p>
      <p>So, what actually is Pandemic? Well, it’s a board game where you work in a team to try and stop the spread of diseases across the globe.</p>
      <p>This video does a good job in summarizing the game and how you play it:</p>

      <p>Personally, I’m a big fan of Pandemic. Although it might sound a bit complex at first, it’s really easy to pick up. Before you know it, you’ll be working together to try and save the world from the ravages of disease.</p>
      <p>The co-operative element is really pleasant too — so this could be a good one to bring back for Christmas if you have a particularly argumentative family.</p>
      <p>So, make sure you take advantage of this great deal, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Z-Man-Games-ZM7101-Pandemic/dp/B00A2HD40E/?tag=tnw88-20">pick up Pandemic for only $40 while you still can</a>.</p>
