      <p>The Super Eagles play Lesotho in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Setsoto Stadium, Maseru on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gernot Rohr’s side are top of Group L with maximum three points following their hard-fought  2-1 win against Benin Republic at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Lesotho are second after claiming a vital point away from home in a 1-1 draw with Sierra Leone.</p>
      <p>Nigeria will be heading into the game with confidence knowing that they have never lost to their opponents since meeting for the first time in 2006 during the 2008 AFCON qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Lesotho will be forced into at least one change to their starting XI with captain Marepe Basia suspended for this game due to his dismissal against Sierra Leone.</p>
      <p>The Eagles have an array of stars and German coach Rohr will be happy with the form of his players for their respective clubs heading into the game.</p>
      <p>Lesotho coach, Thabo Senong, said they will do whatever they can to cage Victor Osimhen and Joe Aribo, Super Eagles’ dangerous forwards.</p>
      <p>He said, ““Nigeria have very physical and skilful players.</p>
      <p>“Osimhen and Aribo have done well at their clubs. Everyone knows them, they are very dangerous. We have to put an eye on them.”</p>
      <p>And Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, said the Crocodiles will not be taken for granted.</p>
      <p>“Leostho are not one of the biggest names in world football, but we won’t take them for granted. They will enjoy the support of their home fans and be pumped up to beat us.</p>
      <p>“We have what it takes to beat them and will go all out to maintain top position in the group.”</p>
      <p>Rohr is most likely to make few changes to the team that defeated Benin.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eagles’ likely XI</b>
      </p>
      <p>Daniel Akpeyi, Ola Aina , William Troost-Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo, Jamilu Collins, Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo, Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze, Victor Osimhen, Samuel Kalu.</p>
