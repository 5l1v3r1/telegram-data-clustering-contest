      <h2>UK prime minister promises future Conservative government would ’get Brexit done.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:09:41+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author">Melissa Heikkilä</a></address>
      <p>U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said every Conservative Party candidate in the upcoming December 12 general election has promised to back his Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/16/boris-johnson-exclusive-pm-says-tax-cuts-can-boost-economy-first/">The Telegraph</a>, Johnson <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/16/boris-johnson-every-tory-election-candidate-has-pledged-back/?hootPostID=8378858b1f78221c0cd859b144de1c7b">said he had gained a commitment from</a> all 635 candidates to back the Withdrawal Agreement agreed with the EU in a vote in the U.K. parliament.</p>
      <p>“If we get a majority Conservative government we can deliver and there will be no more wrangling or dither or delay” on Brexit, Johnson said.</p>
      <p>The prime minister has struggled to unite his party around his plans to push through Brexit. He ejected 21 MPs from the Conservative party in September (later readmitting 10) for backing opposition-sponsored legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. A majority of MPs in parliament in October backed his Brexit deal, but <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-limbo-strikes-again-boris-johnson-uk-parliament-delay/">quickly rejected</a> a fast-track timetable to speed it into law.</p>
      <p>Johnson also said that post-Brexit, EU migrants will face the same treatment as non-EU migrants in order to “treat everybody who comes to this country the same.”</p>
      <p>“We want to put an end to the practice of sending child benefit for instance, to other countries, where the kids are and where they’re going to school. That doesn't make any sense to me to have these kind of remissions of benefits from taxpayers," Johnson said. He claimed the plans would save the U.K. £800 million by 2025.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s party has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-rallies-the-troops-after-tough-day-1-of-election-race/">faced a difficult start</a> to the election campaign. U.K. police <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-police-investigating-allegations-of-electoral-fraud-conservative-house-of-lords-brexit-party/">confirmed Saturday</a> they are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud, following accusations the Conservatives offered benefits to encourage candidates from Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party to stand aside.</p>
      <p>However, the Conservatives hold a consistent lead over opposition parties, according to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">POLITICO’s Poll of Polls</a>.</p>
      <p>In a new <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/16/general-election-poll-conservatives-highest-level-since-2017/">Savanta-ComRes poll</a> for The Telegraph, the Conservative Party is polling at 41 percent, while the Labour Party is at 33 percent. Only 5 percent of people said they would vote for the Brexit Party.</p>
