        <b>Quite recently, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) announced which countries and clubs have been deemed eligible for the 2020 AFC Champions League and AFC Cup, and Twitter channel <a href="https://twitter.com/FootyRankings"><i>FootyRankings</i></a> have predicted the qualifiers opponents for various teams.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As per <i>FootyRankings</i>, for the AFC Champions League, the various footballing associations are split into two regions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>West Region</b> which consists of the associations from the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF), the Central Asian Football Association (CAFA), and the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF).</li>
        <li><b>East Region</b> which consists of the associations from the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) and the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In each region, there are four groups in the group stage, including a total of 12 direct slots, with the 4 remaining slots filled through play-offs.<br/>The top 12 associations in each region as per the AFC rankings are eligible to enter the AFC Champions League.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, Thai League 1 Runners-up Buriram United will face V.League 1 runners-up Ho Chi Minh City. Singapore club Tampines Rovers will face the league champions in Indonesia, while Philippines Football League champions Ceres-Negros will take on Myanmar-based Shan United.</p>
      <p><i>FootyRankings</i> further predicts that I-League Champions Chennai City will lock horns with Bahraini Premier League winners Al-Riffa, while in the 2020 AFC Cup, Indian Super League winners Bengaluru FC will have to face the winners of a preliminary match between Bhutan-based Paro FC and Sri Lanka’s Defenders FC.</p>
