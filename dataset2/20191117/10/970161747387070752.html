        <b>Charlie’s Angels opened with a whimper at the US box office with the blockbuster sequel grossing just $3.1 million (£2.4 million) in its first two days of release.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The reboot, which stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Elizabeth Banks, has been hailed a box office disaster after tanking in its opening days.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/16/friday-box-office-ford-v-ferrari-matt-damon-christian-bale-1094-million-charlies-angels-bomb-kristen-stewart-good-liar-flop-helen-mirren/#504c79c4319c">According to Forbes</a>, the movie took home just $3.15 million on Thursday and Friday in the US, including just $900,000 (£697,400) on day one.</p>
      <p>It’s now on course to earn just $8.2 million (£6.3 million) from its opening weekend despite costing a big budget of $48 million (£37 million) to make.</p>
      <p>Charlie’s Angels is currently sitting in third place behind Ford V Ferrari, which has grossed a whopping $30 million (£23 million) and last week’s number one movie Midway, with $8.8 million (£6.8 million).</p>
      <p>The figures are no doubt a huge disappointment for Elizabeth, 45, who directed the movie and hoped it would enjoy similar success to its first two predecessors, which starred Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore.</p>

      <p>The franchise began as a hugely successful TV series with Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson as the chosen Angels, before launching the movie franchise in 2000 followed by the sequel Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.</p>

      <p>Destiny’s Child earned one of the biggest hits of their career with their song Independent Women Part 1 which led the soundtrack. However, Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey’s Don’t Call Me Angel has failed to set the charts on fire.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth was forced to defend the Charlie’s Angels reboot, and recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/16/friday-box-office-ford-v-ferrari-matt-damon-christian-bale-1094-million-charlies-angels-bomb-kristen-stewart-good-liar-flop-helen-mirren/#504c79c4319c">told Wall Street Journal</a>: ‘You’ve had 37 Spider-Manmovies and you’re not complaining! I think women are allowed to have one or two action franchises every 17 years — I feel totally fine with that.</p>
      <p>‘Being in a big franchise allows you to have it all. I recognise the same thing, it’s almost unfair for women. The best roles are usually in small movies, but then you don’t make any money. It’s okay to want to make money.’</p>
