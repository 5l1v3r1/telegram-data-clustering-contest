      <p>Princess Margaret's marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, goes from brittle to broken over the course of<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-does-the-crown-season-3-premiere-the-historical-drama-will-undergo-some-dramatic-changes-during-the-break-6684837"> <i>The Crown</i>'s third season</a>. She spends the 10th and final episode falling for the much younger landscape gardener Roddy Llewellyn while <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/who-was-lord-snowdons-second-wife-lucy-lindsay-hogg-46764939">Armstrong-Jones romances Lucy Lindsay-Hogg</a>, a young Irish divorcée. He's still seeing Lindsay-Hogg when scandalous paparazzi photos of Margaret and Llewellyn land on the cover of the <i>News of the World</i>, effectively ending their marriage of almost 16 years. But it was far from just a fling. On December 15, 1978, five months after the dissolution of his first marriage, Lord Snowdon took Lindsay-Hogg as his second wife.</p>
      <p>Lindsay-Hogg, a producer, met Snowdon at a dinner party in Chelsea in 1972, after which she became the royal photographer's assistant. When <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/20/archives/margaret-and-snowdon-agree-to-separate-announcement-by-margarets.html?searchResultPosition=12">his separation from Princess Margaret was announced in 1976</a>, the pair was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lord-snowdon-dead-dies-died-princess-margaret-husband-celebrity-photographer-antony-armstrong-jones-a7526156.html">flying to Australia</a> together for an exhibition of his photographs. By then, they'd been seeing each other for four years. According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4129862/Lord-Snowdon-Final-Anne-Courcy-s-biography.html">Snowdon's official biographer,</a> he would sneak out of Kensington Palace, where he lived with Margaret and their two children, to meet Lindsay-Hogg in a nearby flat on Kensington Church Street. Margaret knew about his mistress and refused to even utter her name, referring to Lindsay-Hogg as "the thing," just as she does in <i>The Crown.</i></p>

      <p>After getting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2017/jan/13/lord-snowdon-a-life-in-pictures">married in a Kensington register's office</a>, Snowdon and Lindsay-Hogg <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4129862/Lord-Snowdon-Final-Anne-Courcy-s-biography.html">lived together in a white stucco villa</a> on Launceston Place in Kensington. The home, which was near to the palace where his children still lived, was a gift from the Queen — an addition to the £100,000 settlement he received from Princess Margaret.</p>
      <p>In 1979, Lindsay-Hogg gave birth to the couple's only child together, a daughter named Frances, with whom Snowdon was close. Speaking to <i>Vogue Italia</i>, <a href="https://www.vogue.it/en/news/vogue-arts/2017/07/26/interview-frances-von-hofmannsthal-vogue-italia-july-2017/?refresh_ce=">Frances recalled her childhood</a>: "I grew up in the house where my father had his studio (I'd come home from school and if the red light was on above the door I had to be absolutely silent). Every time he'd finish shooting, he'd call me in to meet his subject."</p>
      <p>But unbeknownst to Lindsay-Hogg, she was not the last of her husband's affairs. Even before they were married, Lord Snowdon had begun to see the married <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/13/lord-snowdon-obituary">journalist Ann Hills</a>.</p>
      <p>Unlike Princess Margaret, who tolerated Snowdon's affairs throughout their marriage, Lindsay-Hogg drew a hard line. When she finally learned of his relationship with Hills, the couple divorced after 22 years of marriage. It would not be discovered until later, but Snowdon also <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3302783/SEBASTIAN-SHAKESPEARE-Marital-bliss-Lord-Snowdon-s-ex-lover.html">had a son with magazine editor Melanie Cable-Alexander</a> while married to Lindsay-Hogg. Still, the two were able to maintain a relationship. In December 2014, a couple of years before Snowdon's death, they were spotted leaving lunch at <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2869752/Wrap-Former-royal-photographer-Lord-Snowdon-leaves-Diana-s-favourite-restaurant.html">La Famiglia in Chelsea</a> — the same neighborhood where, decades earlier, they first met.</p>
