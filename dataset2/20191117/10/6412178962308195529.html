        <b>Manchester United have told Roma that they will have to pay £18m if they want to keep defender Chris Smalling on a permanent basis, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Smalling, who was pushed out of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side in the summer following the arrival of Harry Maguire from Leicester, has kicked on since moving to the Serie A having put in several solid performances.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/report-clarifies-truth-about-roma-efforts-to-seal-permanent-smalling-deal"><b>Recent reports have linked Roma with sealing a permanent deal for the centre-back</b></a> and, according to Italian news outlet <i>Tuttosport</i>, such a deal will come at the price of £18m.</p>
      <p>However, the report continues by saying that Roma’s sporting director, Gianluca Petrachi, is attempting to bring the price tag down.</p>
      <p>It is said that with Maguire having cemented his place at the back for <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united">United</a></b>, Smalling is open to the idea of staying in Italy if the chance arises.</p>
      <p>The Englishman played 323 times for United – chipping in with 18 goals and four assists – before leaving for the Italian top flight.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/juventus-ready-to-consider-offers-for-top-man-utd-arsenal-defensive-target"><b>reports claim that the Red Devils are set to do battle with Arsenal to try and sign a Turkish defender in the January transfer window</b></a>.</p>
