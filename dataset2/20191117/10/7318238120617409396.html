      <p>Sri Lankans have elected a former wartime defence minister as their new President.</p>
      <p>The country is still suffering from the repercussions of April’s Easter Sunday terror attacks which killed more than 250 people and sparked a collapse in the tourism industry.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaska won Saturday’s election promising a tough line on security as well as closer economic ties with China.</p>
      <p>The vote for the 70-year-old is seen as a victory for nationalist forces in Sri Lanka. During his term as defence minister Rajapaska was credited with bringing the war against Tamil separatists to an end.</p>
      <p>HIs main rival, Sajith Premadasa, had campaigned on promises of greater financial support for the poor.</p>
