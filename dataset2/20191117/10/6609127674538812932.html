        <b>ODSONNE EDOUARD is on Crystal Palace’s radar as they hunt for a new striker.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> hitman, has emerged as a possible January target, with Roy Hodgson also interested in <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a>’ Alfredo Morelos.</p>

      <p>Palace have £50million in the bank from the sale of Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>But Hodgson knows it would be tough to nick either player in the middle of a title fight.</p>
      <p>Edouard has been in electric form for the Hoops with 12 goals and 12 assists so far this season.</p>
      <p>He joined Celtic in 2018 in a £9million move from French champions PSG after a successful loan spell at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>Yesterday we told that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4959983/celtic-odsonne-edouard-france-olympics-final/">Edouard could miss over half of the Hoops European qualifiers next season</a> after revealing his Olympics dream.</p>
      <p>The Tokyo 2020 Under-23 tournament runs from July 23 to August 8, with France among the favourites.</p>
      <p>Edouard is desperate to make the squad for Japan — but that would rule him out of key qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The in-form striker insists he’s determined to play a leading role in Sylvain Ripoll’s squad in the Far East next summer.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a very important competition, one that every sportsman dreams of participating in.</p>
      <p>“I have waited a long time to be called up by France at this level and I am keen to do well so I make an impression.”</p>
