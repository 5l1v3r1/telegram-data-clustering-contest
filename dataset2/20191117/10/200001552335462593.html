      <h1>Tottenham player on top of club chief’s list, ready to offer five-year contract – More clarity soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:38:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/naveen-ullal/" target="_blank">Naveen Ullal</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday, we <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/tottenham-player-priority-manager-january-chief-ready-allocate-funds-transfer/">covered a Calciomercato.it report</a> which explained Tottenham Hotspur’s Christian Eriksen is a ‘priority’ for Real Madrid in January.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s edition of <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/">Corriere dello Sport</a> also claimed Inter Milan are looking at those players who will be available on a free transfer next summer and the Denmark international is on top of the club’s list.</p>
      <p>His contract with Spurs expires in 2020 and it’s once again reported Eriksen has no plans to extend contract with the north London club.</p>
      <p>The Nerazzurri know they will face competition for the 27-year-old and are aware that it could be an ‘impossible task’ to complete his signing. However, they believe it would be wrong on their part to not give it a shot.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid are viewed as one of the toughest competitors, but Los Blancos also have other targets. </p>

      <p>Inter’s plan is to offer Eriksen a five-year deal worth €9m/year (including bonuses).</p>
      <p>Whether that will enough for them to tempt him is still to be seen and Corriere dello Sport states the situation around the Tottenham contract rebel will ‘soon become clearer’.</p>
