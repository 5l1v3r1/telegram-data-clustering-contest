      <p>LONDON — British oppposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would not form a coalition government if it fails to secure a majority in parliament at a Dec. 12 election.</p>
      <p>Four opinion polls published on Saturday put Labour between 10 and 17 percentage points behind Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Asked about possible demands for a Scottish independence referendum in return for the support of the Scottish National Party (SNP) if Labour are short of a majority, Corbyn told BBC TV: “We are not doing deals with anybody.”</p>
      <p>“We are not forming coalition governments, we will put forward the program on which we will have been elected,” he said. “The SNP will have a choice, do they want to put Boris Johnson back in … or are they going to say a Labour government will deliver for Scotland.” (Reporting by Kylie MacLellan, editing by Louise Heavens)</p>
