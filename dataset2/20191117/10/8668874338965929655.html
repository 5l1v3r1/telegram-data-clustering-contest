      <h1>Saracens set for dramatic about-turn on salary cap - reports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:04:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Premiership champions <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> won’t prolong the salary cap scandal as they are set to accept their punishment, according to the British media reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-7693821/Saracens-make-dramatic-u-turn-accept-penalties-salary-cap-breaches.html">The Daily Mail reported</a> that the Sarries are set to accept their 35-point deduction and the fine of over £5-million (US$6.5-million) for breaching the Premiership Rugby salary cap for the last three seasons.</p>
      <p>The sanction follows a nine-month investigation by an independent panel, who adjudicated that the Premiership side had contravened the salary cap – which is set at £7-million a year.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the Saracens camp has been very vocal that they would challenge the independent panel’s unprecedented sanctions, with club chairperson Nigel Wray being at the forefront of the battle.</p>

      <p>While Director of Rugby Mark McCall revealed that there was still a decision to be made, stating “all the facts of the case” will come out.</p>
      <p>However, with the deadline for notice of the appeal on Monday, <i>The Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Times</i> UK have reported that the club has opted not to review the judgment despite having previously professed themselves “confident” about the outcome of any such move.</p>
      <p>This means if Saracens accept the 35-point deduction they will now be left on -22 points on the log, 26 points away from the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> Tigers, who are currently bottom of the Premiership table.</p>
      <p>The Sarries now face the very real threat of relegation from the Premiership.</p>
      <p>The judgement comes off the back of revelations about Nigel Wray’s ‘co-investments’ with high profile players.</p>
      <p>Wray was listed with Companies House as a director alongside players such as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/owen-farrell/">Owen Farrell</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/richard-wigglesworth/">Richard Wigglesworth</a> and the Vunipola brothers in companies Faz Investments Ltd, Wiggy9 Investments Limited and VunProp Ltd.</p>
