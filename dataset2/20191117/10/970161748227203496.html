      <p>Communities across England are still facing days of flooding, with more than 100 alerts in place.</p>
      <p>The misery could continue until Tuesday, despite the fact heavy rain is not predicted in the worst hit areas.</p>
      <p>An extremely wet autumn has led to the ground becoming waterlogged, meaning it is very sensitive to any extra rainfall.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has 64 live flood warnings, where flooding is expected and ‘immediate action is required’.</p>
      <p>Additionally, it has issued 95 lower category alerts where flooding is possible and people should be prepared.</p>
      <p>Rivers expected to burst their banks include the Severn and the Trent.</p>

      <p>Warnings had already been issued along the Severn, which burst and led to widespread flooding in Worcester, Tewkesbury and Shrewsbury.</p>

      <p>Towns in Yorkshire have been among the worst hit, with the village of Fishlake near Doncaster largely submerged with roads cut off.</p>
      <p>Meteorologist Sophie Yeomans said there would be some respite from the heavy rain, saying: ‘There is some rainfall around, but it’s looking light and patchy.</p>
      <p>‘Sunday has the highest risk of rainfall, but the start of next week is looking quite dry.</p>
      <p>‘There’s light cloud and rain around in some of the areas in the north of England and also down in Shropshire and the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>‘But there’s no long-lasting or heavy rain – it’s a good situation.’</p>

      <p>In a forecast of the flooding risk in England and Wales, the Environment Agency said: ‘River flooding is expected to continue in the Lower River Don washlands area in South Yorkshire through to at least Tuesday, where properties will continue to flood and there will be continued travel disruption.’</p>
      <p>The Met Office said its Sheffield weather station has recorded its wettest ever autumn.</p>
      <p>It tweeted: ‘With 15 days still to go, the site has already recorded 427.6 mm of #rain. The previous record was set in 2000 with 425.2 mm of rain falling between September 1 and November 30 that year.’</p>

      <p>There is also a ‘risk of seeing a very cold start’ on Tuesday, according to Ms Yeomans, with potential temperatures of minus 5C.</p>
