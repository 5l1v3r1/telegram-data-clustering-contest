      <p>PARIS — French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner blamed “thugs” and “bullies” on Sunday for the violence that hit demonstrations the previous day marking marked the first anniversary of the anti-government “yellow vest” protests.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday, what we saw were few (legitimate) demonstrators but thugs, bullies and morons,” Castaner told Europe 1 radio when asked about the violence in Paris on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators torched cars and pelted police with stones and bottles and police fired tear gas and water cannon during the rallies to mark a year since the birth of the anti-government yellow vest movement.</p>
      <p>Across France, police arrested 264 people on Saturday, including 173 in Paris, Castaner said. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon Editing by Frances Kerry)</p>
