      <p>Colin Kaepernick still has ‘elite’ arm talent according to an NFL executive who attended his public workout on Saturday after the 32-year-old put on his own session to allow the media to attend.</p>
      <p>The NFL had arranged a private workout in Atalanta but denied access to the media, prompting Kaepernick – who last played in the NFL in 2016 when he began kneeling during the US national anthem to protest against racism – to arrange a session 60 miles away at Charles Drew High <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/riverdale/">Riverdale</a>.</p>
      <p>The NFL said it was ‘disappointed’ with the venue change, which happened at just 30 minutes’ notice, and many of the 25 teams scheduled to watch him were unable to do so.</p>

      <p>According to Kaepernick’s agent, he threw in front of representatives for just eight teams: the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, Washington Redskins, San Francisco 49ers, Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions, Tennessee Titans and one more.</p>
      <p>Despite the smaller-than-expected turnout, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195839299658362880">ESPN’s Adam Schefter</a> reports that an NFL executive was impressed with Kaepernick, describing his arm talent as ‘elite’ and saying he threw the ball well.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick was keen for media to attend the session so footage from the workout could be made public, preventing the NFL from controlling the narrative.</p>
      <p>He spoke briefly after the session, saying: ‘Our biggest thing was making sure we had transparency in what went on.</p>
      <p>‘We weren’t getting that elsewhere, so we came out here. It’s important you’re all here [the media]. You’ve all been attacked for the last three years, you continue to be attacked. We appreciate what you all do.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve been ready for three years – I’ve been denied for three years. We have nothing to hide. So we’re waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell, to stop running. Stop running from the truth, stop running from the people.</p>
      <p>‘My agent is ready to talk to any team; I’ll continue to be ready. We’ll let you know if we hear from them. The ball is in their court. We’re ready to go.’</p>

      <p>The NFL released a statement of their own, saying: ‘We are disappointed that Colin did not appear for his workout. Colin’s decision has no effect on his status in the league. He remains an unrestricted free agent eligible to sign with any club.’</p>
