      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> have been left furious after a results spoiler revealed one of the favourites for the final will be booted off the show tonight.</p>
      <p>Viewers branded the decision "totally wrong", after the results, due to be aired on television this evening, were leaked on social media last night.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Absolutely gutted #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Noooooooo #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "Boooo my fave has gone #StrictlyComeDancing2019 #strictly #StrictlySpoiler."</p>
      <p>"Ah come on..it was a complete set up #StrictlySpoiler," another fumed.</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "I shouldn't have searched #StrictlySpoiler. My life is over."</p>
      <p>Last night, the remaining seven couples took to the floor to perform at the famous Blackpool Tower Ballroom.</p>
      <p>However, fans will have to wait until tonight to discover the remaining celebs' fate, as well as watch a huge Westlife performance.</p>
      <p>South Shields comedian <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/chris-ramsey-opens-strictly-come-17269358">Chris Ramsey</a> earned a record score and a standing ovation after opening last night's show withÂ  a funky salsa to Mark Ronson &amp; Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk.</p>
      <p>Dressed in fuchsia pink and accompanied by eight backing dancers Chris, and dancing partner Karen Hauer, had the audience and judges Bruno Toniolli and chief judge Shirley Ballas, on their feet.</p>
      <p>Bruno said: "You really have started Happy Hour across the nation. You looked like you were in a boy band. Your hips have started to unclog - the Draino has worked. Much more serpentine."</p>
