          </p>
          <p>Afghanistan needed five matches to triumph over West Indies in white ball cricket but the side will be glad with the timing of that elusive win. Pulling off their first win over the visitors yesterday to draw parity in the ongoing three match T20 series, Afghanistan managed to not only keep their aspirations of salvaging something alive but keep the series competitive and fresh as well with the win.</p>
          <p>Their win in the second match on Saturday fully falls to the side’s bowlers who ended up being hailed and serenaded with a slew of accolades for their vigour, resolve, determination and character to leave West Indies flummoxed. Despite heading into their defence of a mere 148 distraught and low on confidence with the score making for a sorry reading, Afghanistan pulled off a stunning 41 run win to halt the opposing at a mere 106.</p>

                <p>Where the result saw Afghanistan manage to make amends for their previous results and finally unlock the true potential of their outfit, for West Indies the manner of the defeat doesn’t make for good reading ahead of the culminating tie. The side have little time to paper over the cracks and bridge over the gaps prevelant yesterday, a rhetoric which is bound to engross us in a riveting and an edge of the thriller come the series decider.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>As the matches have kept coming on this surface, the track has started waning and wavering to go on a downward spiral for the batters. With their being no time for the ground team to address the crumbling nature of the surface, the slower bowlers will flourish today as well with the side winning the toss set to come out and bat first today.</p>

                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>The top scorer for his side yesterday, Dinesh Ramdin from Wes indies come into the wicket-keeping slot of our side after managing to put on the 24 runs, an innings which saw his side scram its way past 100 runs. </p>
                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>He might have failed yesterday, but after hs riveting and enthralling half-century in the series opener to guide West Indies to a clinical win, opener Elvin Lewis will continue to retain his place in our Dream 11 side. The second pick was a little dicey one but we have decided to retain faith in his counterpart Brandon King solely due to his performances across the course of 2019 in the shortest format of the game.</p>
                            <p>From Afghanistan meanwhile we are choosing Hazratullah Zazai with the team’s opening getting 26 in a mere 15 balls yesterday to imbue in his side just the ideal impetuous in the powerplay overs.</p>
                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>His side’s match winner yesterday, Karim Janat was single handidly responsible for leaving West Indies in angst with his wicket to wicket line and length seeing him return with 5 wickets to leave West Indies in disarray. It was a pinch perfect performance form the one all-rounder, one accompanied by the 26 runs he got with the bat as well to make him an instant pick for the day.</p>
                            <p>Gulbadin Naib will be giving him company after getting 24 runs in the lower middle-order while from the visiting outfit we have selected Jason Holder after his spell of -223 and 13 runs for the side yesterday.</p>
                            <h3>AFGH vs WI Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>The three wickets in his kitty yesterday were not only a testament to how ominous Kesrick Williams is as quick but also asserted the player’s behemoth rise in the West Indian cricketing fraternity. The pacer was the first player on our mind in this segment of our Dream 11 unit along with Keemo Paul who returned with figures of 2-28 yesterday.</p>
                            <p>We have the two players come in from Afghanistan as well with us choosing Naveen-ul Haq and spinner Rashid Khan for the day after West Indies’ sordid showing with the bat yesterday.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to make Williams our captain for the day while Janat will represent us as vice-captain.</p>
