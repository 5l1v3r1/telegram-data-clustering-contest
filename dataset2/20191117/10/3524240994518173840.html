      <p><b>Ultimate</b> Fighting Championship middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya, says he has no intention of switching to boxing.</p>
      <p>Top UFC fighters from Jorge Masvidal to Stipe Miocic want to make the crossover to boxing, but newly-crowned Adesanya has no intention of leaving the cage.</p>
      <p>The Last Stylebender in a recent edition of Ebro said he plans to make mega-money in the UFC and can’t understand why other fighters won’t adopt the same attitude.</p>
      <p>“This (UFC) is where I’m going to end my career,” Adesanya said.</p>
      <p>“People say, ‘oh, after UFC, you can go to boxing and have one super fight maybe with Canelo and make a hundred million.’ I’m like, I can do that in the UFC. I might be the first fighter to do that in the UFC.”</p>
      <p>Adesanya added that fighting in the ring wiould take away more of his skills, a situation he will not like to find himself, no matter the price.</p>
      <p>“It’s silly. Why would I come to the proving ground of all fighting — the UFC — and then afterward, fight a guy and take away like 80 percent of my weapons,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I want to kick people. I want to strangle someone. I can’t do that in boxing. I don’t want to get into the clinch and then okay, break.”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old unified the middleweight titles with a second round knockout of Robert Whittaker at UFC 243 and plans to defend his title against Yoel Romero next year.</p>
