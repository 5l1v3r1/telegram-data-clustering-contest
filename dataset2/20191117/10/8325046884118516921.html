      <p>Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li, eat your heart out – there’s a new ninja in town, and his name is Davy Gallon.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Frenchman beat English veteran Ross Pearson, 35, a former UFC fighter, in style at the Probellum MMA show in Brentwood, near London, on Saturday, November 16.</p>
      <p>Gallon’s knockout win involved as much guile as it did gymnastics, and the high-flying move was so bold and ridiculous that it has to be a candidate for the knockout of the year.</p>
      <p>It went down in the third round of the Probellum show in England. Gallon shifted his weight on his front-foot while in the middle of the cage, took off and rolled in the air, then whacked Pearson in the head with his foot.</p>
      <p>Pearson crumpled to the floor, concussed, in an instant. Gallon, meanwhile, jumped onto the fence of the cage to celebrate his audacious finish.</p>

      <p>The move was so bizarre and complex that it rendered the commentary team momentarily speechless. One said, ‘Oh s—.’ While another said, “Oh … my … Goodness … me. I don’t even know what to call that!”</p>

      <p>Whatever it was, it would not have looked out of place in a Hong Kong action movie.</p>
