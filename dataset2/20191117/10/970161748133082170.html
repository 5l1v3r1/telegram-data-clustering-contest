      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity is inching closer to its final, with just seven remaining acts taking to the stage in Saturday night’s quarter-final.</p>
      <p>With the show having lost two acts from each of its previous live shows, Saturday’s show saw just one act lose their place in the competition, with the bottom two having to sing to win their place in the semi-final next weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/the-x-factor-celebrity-safe-seats-scrapped-live-on-air-as-simon-cowell-changes-rules-again-11168793/">With Simon having axed the ‘safe seats’ earlier in the show</a>, nobody had a guaranteed passage to next week – but who ended up in the sing-off and who was sent home?</p>
      <p>Here’s what happened on the night…</p>
      <h3>Who left X Factor: Celebrity last night?</h3>
      <p>Saturday night’s show saw Glee star Kevin McHale take on footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>And while Kevin performed Labrinth’s Something’s Got To Give in his bid to remain in the competition, Vinnie performed an acapella rendition of Irish shanty The Galway Shawl, which he dedicated <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/x-factor-celebritys-vinnie-jones-reveals-wife-tanya-is-there-on-stage-with-him-ahead-of-live-show-11068407/">to his late wife Tanya.</a></p>

      <p>And ultimately it was Kevin who was sent home – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/x-factor-celebritys-vinnie-jones-reveals-wife-tanya-is-there-on-stage-with-him-ahead-of-live-show-11068407/">in spite of Vinnie pleading with Simon Cowell to save Kevin</a> and vote him out of the competition instead.</p>
      <p>‘Simon…I feel that I’ve had a fantastic time, I’ve really enjoyed it – it’s been everything I’ve needed since my wife’s passing. This guy is a real singer, I think he can win it, for his career, I would like to step down and let him go through,’ Vinnie said.</p>
      <p>Despite his plea Simon ‘To be fair, I would like to make the final decision please, regardless,’ before adding: ‘The last person in the world I would like to have a fall out with is Vinnie Jones, which means we’re going to have to fall out because I’m going to insist that you stay in the competition.</p>

      <p>‘This is not disrespect to Kevin, I am voting with my heart…I think you have a chance of winning this competition still.’</p>
      <p>Vinnie agreed, saying: ‘He’s the boss,’ as Kevin was voted out of the show – but he took the defeat gracefully.</p>
      <p>‘It’s all good,’ he said. ‘How good was everybody tonight? I felt like I did really well and that’s all you can do.’</p>
