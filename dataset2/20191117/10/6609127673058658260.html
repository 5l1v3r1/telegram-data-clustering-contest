      <p>O’Neill was checking out the Yorkshire-born 22-year-old’s family background in case he qualified for Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Cosgrove, who cost £25,000 from Carlisle, has bagged 16 goals this season.</p>
      <p>The striker had previously been linked with a move to Lazio.</p>
      <p>There was reported interest from the Serie A side in the target man but Cosgrove rubbished the rumours.</p>

      <p>He said: "I heard about it but I think it was a load of rubbish to be honest.</p>
      <p>"Two years ago you could have asked me [what I want out of my career] and I’d have said playing for any professional club and I’d be happy.</p>
      <p>"I always believed in myself as a footballer, but I couldn’t have wished it to go any better so far."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Aberdeen</a> boss Derek McInnes is desperate to keep his top-scorer who is in lethal form this term.</p>
      <p>He insisted at the start of the season, Cosgrove would be going nowhere.</p>
      <p>He said: "We’ve had enquiries about Sam already from other clubs but he will be staying with us this season.</p>
      <p>“He’s improved so much in a short period of time and hopefully there’s more to come from Sam."</p>
