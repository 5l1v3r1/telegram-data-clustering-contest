      <p>India cricketer <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Prithvi-Shaw">Prithvi Shaw</a> made a brilliant comeback to cricket after serving a doping ban as he hit a quickfire 39-ball 63 in a <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Syed-Mushtaq-Ali">Syed Mushtaq Ali</a> Trophy game against Assam on Sunday. The young opening batsman’s innings was laced with seven fours and two sixes. Shaw was yet criticised on social media for his celebration after reaching the 50-run-mark. After reaching the milestone, he broke into the ‘bat does the talking’ celebration showing the bat maker’s name.</p>
      <p>Some fans felt he was trying to imitate India captain <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>, who did something similar after getting to a hundred in a Test match in Perth, Australia not long back.</p>
