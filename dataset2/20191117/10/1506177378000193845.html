      <p>Greece’s former Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras joined the traditional protest march to the US Embassy on Sunday to commemorate the anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising.</p>
      <p>“This year we have many reasons to be there. Not only because the old fans of the junta are not marginalised but in governmental positions. Not only because the violent repression is upgraded to government’s necessity strategy. We will be there mostly to send a message of resistance against the wave of conservatism and setback but also to those that have already assumed that we have reached the end of the story,” said Tsipras in a provocative Facebook posting.</p>
      <p>Many people honoured the commemorations of the Polytechnic uprising and left flowers at the monument and gate that the tank broke on the night of November 17, 1973.</p>
      <p>The gates of the Athens Polytechnic was closed and the traditional commemoration event of the 17th November took place after the roll call of the dead and the playing of the anthem of the Polytechnic uprising.</p>
      <p>The commemoration events culminate each year with the major march to the US Embassy in Athens.</p>
