      <p>C-3PO knows over six million forms of communication, but how many does he actually need to get by? In the on-screen <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/oh-so-the-mandalorian-is-really-going-to-be-about-that-awesome"><i>Star Wars</i> universe</a>, it’s actually more than you might think.</p>
      <p>In a new video from the delightfully trivia-dense YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDe7m0POuwkL1gwnQ-FVhMw"><i>Star Wars</i> Kids</a>, there’s a rundown of every language spoken on-screen in the ten (is it ten? I think it’s ten) <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/the-last-jedi-helped-jj-abrams-do-bolder-things-on-the-rise-of-skywalker"><i>Star Wars</i> movies</a> that have presently been released. And, honestly, it’s more than I thought! Since so much of the alien languages are there for more flavour than communication, I tend to forget just how much alien stuff is in there. These movies are dense with imaginary languages, from Shyriiwook to whatever “Maclunkey” is (Huttese, probably).</p>

      <p>The video also includes some information that I didn’t know and find very interesting, like the fact that the Death Troopers in <i>Rogue One</i> are communicating using some sort of encrypted communication system, explaining why they sound like barking modems.</p>
      <p>What’s your favourite cameo <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/resistance-reborn-is-an-exquisite-payoff-to-4-years-of-star-wars-reborn-expanded-universe"><i>Star Wars</i></a> language? Omnisignal unicode is a good one. Droids know that good good talkin’.</p>
