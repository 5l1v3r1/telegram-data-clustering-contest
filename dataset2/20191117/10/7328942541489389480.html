      <p>In the <b>1950s</b>, people dreamed of using nuclear energy to power all manner of transport — from cars to airplanes to airships. In the U.S. the father of the nuclear reactor, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Enrico-Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, envisioned a nuclear-powered aircraft, while in the USSR, the chief designer of the Soviet atomic bomb, Aleksandr Kurchatov, thought nuclear-powered "heavy aircraft" could be built.</p>
      <p>A nuclear-powered bomber seemed a no-brainer since it could theoretically stay aloft indefinitely, providing an effective deterrent to a nuclear attack. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union researched nuclear-powered aircraft, but neither country developed an active-duty version due to problems inherent in the design. These included shielding air and ground crews from radiation, and the possible effect of a crash.</p>

      <p>To date, no civilian nuclear-powered aircraft has ever been created.</p>
      <h3>Nuclear-powered jet engines</h3>
      <p>In <b>May 1946</b>, the U.S. Air Force initiated the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) program. In <b>1951</b>, NEPA was supplanted by the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program, which was run by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Atomic-Energy-Commission-United-States-organization">Atomic Energy Commission</a>.</p>
      <p>ANP studied two different types of nuclear-powered jet engines: General Electric's Direct Air Cycle, and Pratt &amp; Whitney's Indirect Air Cycle.</p>
      <p>In the Direct Air Cycle program, which was based in Evendale, Ohio, air was drawn directly through the nuclear core, where it was heated, then sent through a turbine and out the exhaust as thrust. The drawback to this design was that the air became irradiated and left a trail of radioactive particles in the plane's wake.</p>
      <p>The Indirect Air Cycle method, which was based near Middletown, Connecticut, used a heat exchanger, where heat from the nuclear reactor heated either pressurized water or liquid metal. This, in turn, heated air which moved through a turbine and out the exhaust, providing thrust.</p>
      <p>While the Indirect method was the safer of the two, its program never was able to produce hardware that was flight-ready before the program was canceled.</p>
      <h3>The Aircraft Reactor Experiment</h3>
      <p>While the propulsion came down to the Direct method, a reactor that could fly on board an aircraft was still needed. The U.S. Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was created to develop a high-power-density and high-output-temperature nuclear reactor for use on an aircraft.</p>
      <p>The design that researchers settled on became the first <a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/molten-salt-reactors.aspx">molten salt reactor</a> (MSR). It used molten fluoride salt (NaF-ZrF<sub>4</sub>-UF<sub>4)</sub> as fuel, and was moderated by beryllium oxide (BeO). The reactor achieved a peak temperature of <b>860° C.</b> and a peak of <b>2.5 MW<sub>th</sub></b>.</p>
      <h3>The MX-1589 Project</h3>
      <p>Now that a propulsion system and a reactor had been created, a plane was needed with which to test. On <b>September 5, 1951</b>, the Air Force awarded a contract to Convair to fly a nuclear reactor on board its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_B-36_Peacemaker">Convair B-36 Peacemaker</a> aircraft.</p>
      <p>Convair was the result of a merger between Consolidated Aircraft and Vultee Aircraft. In <b>1953</b>, Convair was purchased by General Dynamics and became one of its divisions.</p>
      <p>The B-36 Peacemaker was a strategic bomber that was flown by the U.S. Air Force from <b>1948</b> to <b>1959</b>. Between <b>1948</b> and <b>1955</b>, the B-36 was the primary nuclear weapons delivery vehicle of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Strategic-Air-Command-United-States-Air-Force">Strategic Air Command</a> (SAC), but was replaced by the jet-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress">Boeing B-52 Stratofortress</a>. All except <b>five</b> Peacemakers were scrapped.</p>
      <p>At <b>230 ft</b> (<b>70.1 m</b>), the B-36 had the longest wingspan of any combat aircraft ever built, and it was the first bomber capable of delivering any of U.S.'s nuclear bombs from within its <b>four</b> bomb bays without needing any modification.</p>
      <p>The Peacemaker had a range of <b>10,000 mi</b> (<b>16,000 km</b>), a maximum payload of <b>87,200 lb<b> (<b>39,600 kg</b></b></b>), and it was capable of intercontinental flight without refueling.</p>
      <p>The NB-36H Nuclear Test Aircraft (NTA) was created to study the shielding requirements for an airborne nuclear reactor. It had a modified cockpit and a raised nose, and from <b>July 1955</b> to <b>March 1957</b>, it flew a total of <b>47</b> times over West Texas and Southern New Mexico.</p>

      <p>While the reactor, dubbed the Aircraft Shield Test Reactor (ASTR), was operational, it did not power the aircraft. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-60-no-2/pdfs/Garthoff-Aircraft-Nuclear-Propulsion.pdf">News of the flights leaked out to Russia</a>, who misinterpreted it as a successful test of a nuclear-powered engine, and this spurred the Soviets into redoubling their efforts to produce a competing airplane.</p>
      <p>The Russians came up with a test aircraft, "Aircraft 119", or <i>LAL (Letayushchaya atomnaya laboratoriya),</i> which translates to "the Flying Atomic Laboratory." Nicknamed The Swallow, the craft was a modified four-engine turboprop Tu-95 (NATO code-name Bear) which was the largest Soviet bomber at that time.</p>

      <p>In the summer of <b>1961</b>, just like in the American tests, The Swallow took flight with the reactor on board, but not providing any propulsion.</p>
      <p>In <b>September 1959</b>, the first intercontinental ballistic missiles entered into service and eliminated the need for a nuclear-powered aircraft. On <b>March 26, 1961,</b> the new president, John F. Kennedy, canceled the nuclear-powered aircraft program, citing its high cost and the fact that no flight-worthy reactor had been produced.</p>
      <h3>Nuclear-powered jet engines</h3>
      <p>In <b>1956</b>, the ANP program ran modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_J47">General Electric J47 jet engines</a> on nuclear power from a reactor test assembly called Heat Transfer Reactor Experiment 1 (HTRE-1).</p>

      <p>HTRE-1 used vertical control rods, while a successor, HTRE-2, featured a removable core. HTRE-3 had horizontal control rods which were better suited to an airframe.</p>

      <p>As an odd aside to the nuclear-powered aircraft story, the U.S. military considered solving the shielding problem by <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2968/059006009">employing elderly crews to fly the nuclear-powered airplanes</a>. Their thinking was that the crew would die of natural causes before the effects of radiation could kill them.</p>
