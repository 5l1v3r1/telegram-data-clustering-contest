      <p>ADELAIDE: Left-arm spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashton-Agar">Ashton Agar</a> on Sunday suffered a laceration to the bridge of his nose in Western Australia's Marsh One-Day Cup game against South Australia.</p>
      <p>Ashton Agar grassed a catch hit by his own brother Wes at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karen-Rolton">Karen Rolton</a> Oval, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Ashton ran around to take a catch off his younger sibling Wes Agar at mid-on, but slipped and copped the ball right between his eyes, the report said.</p>

      <p>There was blood on Ashton's face and teammate <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jhye-Richardson">Jhye Richardson</a> signaled for medical assistance right away as Wes ran over to check on his brother's well-being.</p>
      <p>Wes Agar later said the incident shook him, but was relieved after speaking to his brother.</p>
      <p>"He slipped over and the ball hit his glasses and the glasses split him open," said the 22-year-old fast bowler.</p>
      <p>"The doctor wanted to stitch him up, but he just got engaged so he said he'll leave it to a plastic surgeon.</p>
      <p>"I was pretty rattled ... It looked really bad. I was just worrying about his health. I wasn't thinking about anything else, I just ran out of my crease to go to see him.</p>
      <p>"I didn't feel great, but thankfully he's okay."</p>
