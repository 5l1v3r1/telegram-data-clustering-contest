      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s mum won’t be tuning in to watch her daughter put through her paces on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-celebrity-start-will-every-night-11078309/">when the series kicks off tonight</a>.</p>
      <p>Esther Jenner has made it pretty darn clear that she’s not a fan of reality shows that ‘frightens’ contestants in the name of entertainment and so she won’t be giving the ITV show any attention.</p>
      <p>The 93-year-old admitted: ‘We have a Survivor [show] here in the United States, I never watched it, I’ve skimmed over it, or seen previews and I decided that I don’t really care for that.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘That’s not entertainment to me, to see somebody frightened. I think she could spend a lot more pleasant times on the golf course.’</p>
      <p>She continued to<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10356705/caitlyn-jenners-mum-93-wont-watching-frightening-im-a-celebrity/"> The Sun</a>: ‘I’ve tried not to think of Caitlyn being over there [in Australia]. It’s three weeks… a long time to go without hearing from her.</p>
      <p>‘When she’s in the States she calls me almost every day, so I’ve got to live without hearing her.’</p>

      <p>Esther has no idea why her daughter Caitlyn has signed up to take part in I’m A Celebrity and is worried that she’ll get bitten by a poisonous critter.</p>
      <p>She might be relieved to hear then that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebrity-bosses-confirm-live-bugs-wont-be-eaten-in-bush-tucker-trials-11168266/">no live bugs will be eaten in Bush Tucker trials</a> this year, and that bosses have confirmed that this change is going to be permanent.</p>

      <p>A rep for I’m A Celeb told Metro.co.uk: ‘No live critters will be eaten in the Bush Tucker trials this year. Producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be eaten this year.</p>
      <p>‘They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.’</p>

      <p>This year’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/">I’m A Celebrity line-up</a> is a corker, with Caitlyn joining the likes of Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, radio presenter Adele Roberts and Good Morning Britain’s Kate Garraway.</p>
