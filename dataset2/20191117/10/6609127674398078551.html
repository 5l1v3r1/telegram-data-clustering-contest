        <b>NEIL LENNON doesn’t regret walking away from Celtic first time around.</b>

      <p>But he never wants to leave the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> again.</p>

      <p>Lennon announced he was stepping down as Parkhead boss in May 2014 after four years at the helm.</p>
      <p>During that time he won three titles and two Scottish Cups, but his ambition was fuelling him to try something else.</p>
      <p>Yet, after being sacked by Bolton and leaving Hibs, he returned to the club where his heart always remained.</p>
      <p>After winning the Treble last term, Lennon has the Hoops top of the league and in the last 32 of the Europa League, thanks to stunning home and away wins against Lazio.</p>

      <p>Those European nights are what he missed most — and why he wants to stay for as long as possible this time.</p>
      <p>Lennon, 48, said: “I had my reasons for leaving at that time.</p>
      <p>“I don’t regret it because it was the right thing for me to do at the time.</p>
      <p>“But I wanted to bring those big European nights back to Celtic Park.</p>
      <p>“The Lazio win was the perfect storm for a European game at Celtic Park. The game matched the atmosphere, the occasion, the performance and the result.</p>
      <p>“We got a taste of it against Cluj at home, but Lazio was even better and I want more of it. Once you get a taste, you want the players and the fans to get more nights like that because we all enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“It makes me never want to leave again.</p>

      <p>“But I’m older and wiser now. I’ve got a second crack and I’m really grateful for the opportunity.</p>
      <p>“I inherited a really good squad and we’ve brought in quality players, so I’m really loving what I’m doing here at the minute.</p>
      <p>“I know it’s a high-pressure job, but I’m embracing the challenge.</p>
      <p>“We’re top of the league and in the last 32 of the Europa League. I can’t ask any more of the players, in terms of what they’re giving me.</p>
      <p>“When I left first time around I was ambitious and wanted to try other things. But I feel differently now.</p>
      <p>“After beating Barcelona in the Champions League we changed the squad, we sold a lot of good players and there was no Rangers.</p>
      <p>“In my last year we won the league by 29 points, so you’re thinking, ‘Is it time for me to change?’ and, ‘Is it time for the club to make a change?’. Maybe it needed a new voice because four years is a long time in football at a club like this.</p>
      <p>“So it was a good time for me to go. I left on the best of terms, with the opportunity of the door maybe being open in the future.</p>
      <p>“You can’t predict that, but thankfully that’s the way it’s turned out.</p>
      <p>“Having this opportunity again is fantastic. I’m really enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“The fact Rangers are back challenging drives me on too. It heightens the senses and pushes me on.</p>
      <p>“The way we’re playing right now is fantastic. With the big games we’ve got coming up, I can’t ask for much more.</p>
      <p>“But I know it can flip very quickly.</p>
      <p>“I can’t imagine a feeling like we had against Lazio in the home game anywhere else in football. That’s just what Celtic brings.</p>
      <p>“What that can do for the players, in terms of their own gravitas, is brilliant too.</p>
      <p>“There’s that feeling. I talk to the players a lot about that. It’s not about the money or the medals, it’s about that feeling you get after a performance like that.</p>
      <p>“Only those players as individuals can experience that glow of complete satisfaction.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t last long in this game, but that’s what you play for.”</p>
