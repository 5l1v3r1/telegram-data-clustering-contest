      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-philip/">Prince Philip</a> – Duke of Edinburgh and husband to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth II</a> – is a character, to say the least.</p>
      <p>Which could explain why he’s the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/13/prince-harry-beats-meghan-markle-kate-and-the-queen-as-most-popular-royal-8133398/">nation’s fifth favourite royal</a>, above Prince Charles, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/meghan-markle/">Meghan Markle</a> and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.</p>
      <p>Prince Philip might be known for his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/04/the-gaffes-that-will-define-prince-philip-as-he-retires-at-95-6615148/">off-the-cuff quips</a> and one-liners, but he has a fascinating history, starting with his intriguing mother, who features in Netflix’s newly released third season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-crown/">The Crown.</a></p>
      <p>She’s played in the series by actress Jane Lapotaire, but who was Princess Alice in real life? Here’s what you need to know about her.</p>
      <h3>Who was Prince Philip’s mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg?</h3>
      <p>Princess Alice of Battenberg was born on 25 February 1885 at Windsor Castle.</p>
      <p>She is a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, which is how Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are distantly related (being second cousins once removed).</p>

      <p>She was born congenitally deaf and grew up as a Hessian princess.</p>

      <p>In 1903, Alice married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, living with her new husband in Greece until their forced exile in 1917 due to Andrew’s involvement in the Greco-Turkish war.</p>
      <p>After their exile, the family of seven – including Prince Andrew, Princess Alice, Prince Philip and his four older sisters – briefly settled in Paris, before Philip was sent to live in England and his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>Princess Alice was committed to a Swiss sanatorium in 1930, becoming a patient of Sigmund Freud.</p>
      <p>Princess Alice was reported as having an extreme religious conversion around this time, believing she was getting divine messages.</p>

      <p>Freud was said to have blamed ‘sexual frustration’ for her condition and recommended x-raying her ovaries to kill off her libido.</p>
      <p>She stayed at the sanatorium for two years before leaving to live back in Greece, devoted to her religion.</p>
      <p>She had a peaceful existence there until World War 2.</p>
      <p>When the Nazis occupied Greece, Alice risked her life by hiding a Jewish family in her home, using her deafness to avoid having to ask questions.</p>

      <p>After World War II, Princess Alice opened a convent called the Christian Sisterhood of Martha and Mary, dedicated to helping the sick and vulnerable in Greece.</p>
      <h3>When did Princess Alice of Battenberg die?</h3>
      <p>She moved back to England in 1967, living at Buckingham Palace until her death in 1969.</p>
      <p>Her cause of death wasn’t reported, but she was thought to be increasingly frail in her later years.</p>
