      <h1>Michael Avenatti finds 'nothing funny' about Pete Davidson's 'SNL' impression in tongue-in-cheek tweet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:08:35+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>Lawyer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-avenatti">Michael Avenatti</a> said he found “nothing funny” about "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live">Saturday Night Live</a>"’s cold open this weekend that put a soap opera twist on the latest developments in the House <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> hearings - and poked a bit of fun at people forgetting him.</p>
      <p>In what seemed a caricature of President Trump's Twitter style, Avenatti said there was “Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC!"</p>
      <p>"Question is, how does that total loser Pete Davidson save his dieing [sic] mediocre career by playing me and get away with these total Democratic hit jobs without retribution? This is the real quid pro quo. Investigate!!!”</p>

      <p>The cold open, titled “Days of Our Impeachment,” featured a mess of characters, including Ambassador Bill Taylor falling in love with “telenovela sensation” Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, Ambassador Gordon Sondland with amnesia and cast member Pete Davidson playing Avenatti, the ex-Stormy Daniels lawyer trying to shock the room with details about his former client’s alleged encounter with the president.</p>

      <p>“I’ve got a bombshell that will change everything!” Davidson’s Avenatti proclaimed. “The president had an affair!”</p>

      <p>“That storyline was from like last season,” John Hamm as Taylor answered.</p>
      <p>“Fine, I’ll go, but you haven’t seen the last of …Who am I playing again?” Davidson laughed in the second reference to a recent airing of "Jeopardy!," in which none of the contestants were able to correctly answer "Who is Avenatti?"</p>
      <p>“Michael Avocado,” Davidson quipped after he’s reminded of Avenatti’s name.</p>
