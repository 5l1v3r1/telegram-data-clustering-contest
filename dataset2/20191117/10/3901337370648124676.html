      <p>Benzema last earned a call-cup to the national side back in 2015, following his involvement in the blackmail of Mathieu Valbuena over a sex tape in 2015.</p>
      <p>Despite his impressive form over the past two season for Los Blancos since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, there has been no call-up for the 31-year-old and Le Graet confirmed on Saturday there will be no return for the striker.</p>

      <p>'For me, Benzema is a very good player. I have never criticised his qualities', he told RMC.</p>
      <p>'On the contrary, he is proving again this year at Madrid that he is one of the best players in his position. But the adventure with France is over.'</p>
      <p>Benzema took to social media to respond almost immediately on Saturday evening</p>

      <p>“Noël, I thought that you did not interfere with the decisions of the national team coach! Know that it will be me and me alone who decides when my international career is over. If you think that I am finished, let me play for a country that I am eligible to play for (France, but also Algeria) and we will see.” Benzema tweeted.</p>
