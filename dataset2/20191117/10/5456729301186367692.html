      <h1>#BayelsaDecides: APC coasting to victory in Goodluck Jonathan's local government</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T10:22:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 10:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/363701-bayelsadecides-apc-coasting-to-victory-in-goodluck-jonathans-local-government.html" target="_blank">Taiwo-Hassan Adebayo</a></address>
      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) is leading with a wide margin in President Goodluck Jonathan’s Ogbia Local Government Area, the results of Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa State show.</p>
      <p>The ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is trailing the APC from results of the wards collated so far at the local government headquarters in Ogbia Town.</p>
      <p>The collation was still ongoing at the time of this report.</p>
      <p>Mr Jonathan is believed to have withheld support for his party, PDP, over disagreement with Governor Seriake Dickson, who ensured Duoye Diri was sponsored as the party’s candidate at the expense of Timi Alaibe, backed by the former president.</p>
