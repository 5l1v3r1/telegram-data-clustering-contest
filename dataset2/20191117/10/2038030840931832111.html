      <p>Cape Town – Pierce Brosnan's youngest sons, Dylan and Paris, have been chosen as the Golden Globe Ambassadors of 2020.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced on Thursday that Dylan (22) and Paris (18) assume the ambassador title for the 77th annual Golden Globes Awards in January.</p>
      <p>An ambassador is traditionally the child of a celebrity and assists with award presentations, handing out trophies to winners and escorting them off stage.</p>
      <p>They are the first pair of brothers to hold the title, which was held by <b><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/idris-elbas-daughter-named-golden-globe-ambassador-20181115">I</a></b><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/idris-elbas-daughter-named-golden-globe-ambassador-20181115"><b>dris Elba's daughter, Isan in 2019</b></a> and <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/the-rocks-daughter-named-2018-golden-globe-ambassador-20171116-2"><b>Dwayne Johnson's daughter, Simone in 2018</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The HFPA renamed the role, formerly known as Miss Golden Globe, in 2017. The association wanted to expand the role to help recognise the HFPA's philanthropic efforts throughout the year.</p>
      <p>"For the first time in Golden Globe history, we've proudly selected two brothers to represent the Hollywood Foreign Press Association this awards season," said HFPA president Lorenzo Soria in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Dylan and Paris Brosnan have already achieved tremendous success in the fashion world and are following in their father's footsteps in entertainment. We're excited to see how they'll use this platform to contribute their talents to elevate the important issue of childhood hunger."</p>
