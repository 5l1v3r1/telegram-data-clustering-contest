      <h1>Rakitic still hasn't scored when he's played!</h1>

        <b>Ivan Rakitic's season is rather difficult, atypical for the Croatian. It's not that he doesn't play that much anymore, it's that he's the only midfielder in the first team, with Carles Aleana, who hasn't scored a goal yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We have reached the first third of the season and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/i-rakitic-2139">Ivan Rakitic</a> has played just <b>ten games.</b> From these ten, he has only started one, the day Barcelona visited Nuevo Los Carmenes. Some very poor figures, <b>especially for a footballer who is used to playing all the time.</b></p>
      <p>These<b> 255 minutes of game time</b> that he has under his belt have a consequence and it is that he<b> has not been able to find goal.</b> It is not that he is a player who loves to score, but the truth is that Ivan Rakitic had scored<b> at least one goal</b> in some official game in each season practically <b>since his debut in the elite.</b></p>

      <p>He has not, not scored in any season he has played for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona, </a>but his lack of participation in the current season could lead him to break <b>a streak that began in 2006</b>, more than a decade ago.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he is<b> the only midfielder in the Barcelona squad </b>who has not scored a goal, as stated by 'AS'. <b>Busquets' goal against Celta</b> leaves him, along with Aleana, as the only midfielder without a goal. A very select club where <b>Sergi Roberto</b> should not be counted, as <b>Valverde</b> uses him more as a full-back than as a midfielder.</p>
