      <p>Breakups are difficult enough. But now you’ve ended things with someone in your office. You have now entered a minefield. Here’s how to cope. This article addresses how to cope with breaking up with an “equal” at the office. Dating a boss or employee is an article unto itself.</p>
      <h3>Reconsider Office Dating</h3>
      <p>It makes sense that people in the office would date each other, seeing as you spend the majority of your day together. However, as you may have discovered from a recent breakup, the downside is that you are spending most of your day together. Remember that you are not alone —<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/career-advice/2019/02/12/office-dating-workplace-relationships-follow-company-policy/2802194002/"> 25 to 30 percent of</a> <a href="https://www.jobvite.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017_Job_Seeker_Nation_Survey.pdf">coworkers have dated within their office</a>.</p>
      <p>Do consider that dating someone at the office makes a breakup more complicated, and it can impact your productivity. In extreme cases, it may cause you to lose your job.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say you should never date someone with whom you have worked. Again, sometimes finding Mr. or Ms. Right at the office is inevitable. If there’s someone at the office that is a great match, and the two of you have considered making it long-term, consider a transfer to another department, or look for a new job.</p>
      <h3>Acknowledge the Awkwardness</h3>
      <p>If you run into each other in the break room, be civil to each other. Even if you don’t feel like it. You can even say, “Well, this is awkward,” with a smile. Sometimes putting the obvious out in the open makes the obvious not so bad. If you have a particular schedule at work, for example, coffee break at 10:15, change up your routine so you don’t run into your ex. When you and your ex were together, you most likely changed your patterns so you could spend some time together at the office. The two of you may still be in those same patterns after your breakup. Instead of going for coffee, take a walk outside. Get coffee at 10:45 instead of 10:15. Make it less likely that you will run into your ex.</p>
      <h3>Discuss Work Behavior at the Breakup</h3>
      <p>While breakups tend to not go smoothly, now you have another topic to discuss — how to navigate the workday without causing more strife between the two of you. While it’s not the ideal timing to talk about this, but you probably won’t find a better time than After all, the chances of you seeing each other outside of work from now on are fairly slim. Are the two of you working on a project together? Will you continue to work together and attempt to be civil, or will one of you back out and find a replacement? Keep in mind that the person who proposed the breakup may have the burden of backing away from a shared project. If your former partner is hurt or angry, he or she may stay on a project as a sign of not acquiescing to yet another one of your requests.</p>
      <p>Some former couples have even discussed how they will address each other in the hallway or when they walk past each others’ cubicles. One couple agreed that they would give a civil greeting when they saw each other, but there would be no loitering or chit-chat. Other couples have discussed whether they would let their coworkers know that they had ended their relationship. This depends on how much you let your coworkers know about your relationship in the first place. If your relationship was kept quiet, consider keeping your breakup quiet as well. And never criticize your ex at the office. That information will get back to them.</p>
      <h3>Ending Your HR Statement</h3>
      <p>You may have been required by human resources (HR) to disclose your relationship at the office. However, after a breakup, a question remains. Do you then need to tell HR that your relationship has ceased to exist? And if so, who is going to do the telling? Are both of you marching down to HR? Or do you leave it alone, and just go to HR when you need to report a new relationship? Discuss this with your former partner.</p>
      <h3>Be Prepared to See Your Ex Moving On</h3>
      <p>When you break up with someone in the non-work world it can be easier for you to heal. The adage “out of sight, out of mind” can be very true for rebuilding after a breakup. However, at work, you see your ex every day. You hear through the grapevine that your ex is dating again. That stings in any context, but it can be even more painful if you and your ex have cubicles near each other. Remember that your ex is most likely hearing about you moving on as well. This is a situation that is difficult for both of you. However, as time goes on, this will bother you less and less. And consider getting your cubicle moved.</p>
      <p>Then you find out your ex is starting to date someone else in the office. Your coworker has a date with Janet in Accounting tonight. You want to warn Janet that your ex cheated, and you think they would probably do it again. <i>Don’t do it</i>. You may think you are doing Janet a favor but consider your motives. Are you really looking out for Janet, or are you wanting to get back at your ex? And either way, this will get back to your ex. Stay away from that hornet’s nest.</p>
      <h3>Be Aware of Harassment</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are cases where an ex has created an untenable work environment for their ex. For more guidance, see the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm">guidelines on what constitutes workplace harassment.</a></p>
