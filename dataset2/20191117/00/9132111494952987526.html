      <p>The first factory to be opened under government's flagship project, One District One Factory, Ekumfi Fruits and Juice factory, has begun test production of Eku juice.</p>
      <p>The pineapple juice comes in a green and yellow juice box with One District One Factory logo boldly featuring on the side.</p>
      <p>The factory, which is said to be the biggest pineapple juice processing factory in West Africa, is expected to process about 300,000,000 packs of juice annually for the local and export markets.</p>
      <p>Expected revenue to be generated by the factory annually is pegged at GHÂ¢530 million.</p>
      <p>Some months ago, the Director of the company, Fredrick Kobbyna Acquah disclosed that for the factory to run continuously, there will be the need to procure extra machines.</p>
      <p>"We also have other challenges. The major one being the redundancy period which is the 14 months maturity period for the pineapples to be ready. This causes production to halt," he noted.</p>
