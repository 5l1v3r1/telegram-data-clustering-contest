      <p><i>The Walking Dead</i> is going to be airing <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWalkingDead/status/1196065454399217665">quite a significant episode tonight</a>, but before I get into that, I wanted to address a plotline in the future from now, what was essentially the last storyline of the comics before they ended their run.With Eugene’s contact with a radio voice, we know that we are indeed heading toward the Commonwealth at some point in the future, a new community. And yet we will arrive at that storyline without three, really four of its core characters, Rick, Carl, Michonne and Dwight.</p>
      <p>Rick is spirited away to star in his spin-off movies, which may indeed have something to do with the Commonwealth (more on that later), but he won’t be around TWD itself. Carl is dead. Michonne is leaving the show some time this season. Dwight is on <i>Fear the Walking Dead</i> which means he might as well be dead.</p>
      <p>And yet each of these characters had a role to play in the Commonwealth storyline, though now we can see how their replacements are starting to be formed. This season, we saw who is going to replace Michonne specifically.</p>
      <p>Now, we’re really going to get into <b>spoiler territory.</b></p>
      <p>Michonne is one of the first people to initially make contact with the Commonwealth and meet its leaders, and is overjoyed when she finds her missing daughter living there. She learns that this society is structured based on what you did before the fall. As a former lawyer, Michonne “earns” privileges and housing associated with that kind of high station.</p>

      <p>But with Michonne gone, it’s becoming clear who will replace her, Yumiko. Yumiko, Magna’s girlfriend and emerging leader of that mini-group, revealed this season that she used to be a lawyer. Magna’s lawyer, specifically, as Magna was accused of some unspecified crime. So when the show needs a lawyer and Michonne has left the series, it’s going to be her. I also wonder if Yumiko will end up finding some lost sister or something in the Commonwealth to keep that aspect of the storyline going as well.</p>
      <p>And what this also means is that I believe Magna is being set up for the Dwight role. In the comic, working class Dwight is <i>really</i> not a fan of the Commonwealth’s system of doing things, and does his part to try and stir up a populist uprising in the community, culminating in a moment where he draws a gun on the Commonweather’s leader, Pamela Milton, forcing Rick to actually shoot him dead. Once upon a time it seemed like Daryl was sliding into Dwight’s role on the show, but that was back when Rick was still around, and now that doesn’t seem like it will happen. It does, however, seem that Magna will probably be the one causing trouble in the Commonwealth while Yumiko is living the good life. This creates an extra dimension of tension given that the two are together. Though by that point, maybe they won’t be.</p>

      <p>That leaves the main question of who will be Rick Grimes in this whole scenario. The obvious choice seems like it would be Daryl, who is emerging as de facto leader these days, and yet he’s a very, very different type of leader than Rick, and it seems somewhat unlikely that he would take the same positions as Rick did in that storyline. Carol seems like she could be a better fit, though obviously I don’t want Milton’s son ending up assassinating either Daryl or Carol, which is how Rick dies in the comics. Now that I think of it, with Maggie returning to the show, it could be her in Rick’s role. Judith or Lydia will probably have Carl’s role in the story.</p>
      <p>It has been pretty interesting to see The Walking Dead simultaneously both stick closely to the comics, but do so without so many major characters from Rick to Carl to Maggie. Now it will lose Michonne too, and yet the Commonwealth storyline seems like it will still be going according to plan anyway. But after that? No more roadmap, and the show will be flying alone with the comic storylines exhausted.</p>
