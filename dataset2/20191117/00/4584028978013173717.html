      <p>The West Indies Women continued their recent struggles against India after going down by five runs in a rain-affected T20I fixture at Providence Stadium in Guyana.</p>
      <p>Only 18 overs were possible after a steady downpour held up the start of play.  When the teams did take the pitch, it was the Windies Women who won the toss and opted to field.  Middle-order batsman Pooja Vastrakar was the only player to score double figures with 10 as the team had a balanced scoring act to speed to 50 for 7 off their 9 overs.</p>
      <p>Hayley Matthews was the pick of the Windies bowlers after claiming figures 3 for 13.  Afy Fletcher and Sheneta Grimmond were also among the wickets after claiming two each.</p>
      <p>In response, Matthews also starred at the top of the order after making 11 from 14 balls, with Chinelle Henry also adding an identical total.  Natasha McLean also contributed 10 from 9 balls but the team eventually fell short as they ran out of overs.  Anuja Patil was the best bowler for India after claiming 2 for 8.  The result marked a fourth consecutive loss for the regional team who have been unable to keep pace with India for either the T20 or previously played ODI series.</p>
