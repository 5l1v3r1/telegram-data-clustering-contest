Jānis Ozoliņš was appointed as the company’s insolvency administrator, as confirmed by the court’s representative Viktorija Mežance.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She explains that the insolvency process was initiated based on the report from insolvency administrator Mareks Diks. At the same time, legal protection process is terminated because it was found that Dzintars did not comply with requirements of the legal protection process plan of 25 April 2019 for longer than 30 days.</p>
      <p>And so the court noticed signs of insolvency process as outlined in Part 1 of Section 57 of the Law on Insolvency. The court concluded that this is grounds for declaring an insolvency process for Dzintars legal person.</p>
      <p>Mežance admits that the most notable creditor in this case was the State Revenue Service (VID), whose 11 October 2019 decision makes it clear that the tax administration does not agrees with Dzintars’ and VID’s submitted amendments to the legal protection process plan’s redaction of 20 September 2019.</p>

        <b>In the final reading, Latvia’s Saeima approved controversial amendments to the Law on Financing of Political Organizations, significantly boosting state support for political parties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Debates and discussions about this legislative draft on Thursday, 14 November, during which the Saeima decided on the next year’s budget, transpired without involvement from opposition deputies. Nevertheless, the absence of the opposition did not contribute to a unified vote from the coalition – 53 deputies voted in favour of amendments, three voted against and one parliamentarian abstained in the vote.</p>
      <p>Two KPV LV party members – Kaspars Ģirģens and Ieva Krapāne – voted against the legislative draft. Non-party deputy Inguna Rībena also voted against it. KPV LV faction member Ivars Puga abstained in the vote, vice-chairman of the party’s chairman Ēriks Pucens did not take part in the vote. Approximately one-third of KPV LV faction deputies did not vote together with their colleagues and the coalition. After the decision was made, Pucens mentioned that he made a mistake in the vote. Saeima Praesidium was asked to change his vote. With that, a total of 54 deputies voted in favour of amendments.</p>

      <p>Latest recommendations from the European Commission and OECD urge Latvia to allocate considerable increase of state funding for healthcare in order to improve accessibility and quality. The same is stated in Latvia’s Healthcare Financing Law. However, the government and the Saeima are illegally preparing to worsen healthcare funding in the coming years. Additionally, there are no plans to ensure funding increase for the industry, the trade union states.</p>
