      <h1>HP rejects $33.5 billion takeover offer from Xerox</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Skidmore Sell</a></address>
      <p>HP Inc. says its board has rejected a roughly $33.5 billion takeover offer from Xerox.</p>
      <p>The Palo Alto, California-based company said Sunday that the cash and stock deal undervalues its business and its board cited concerns about “outsized” debt levels should the companies combine.</p>
      <p>HP, which makes computers and printers, said it recognizes the potential benefits of consolidation and remains open to exploring other options to combine with Xerox Holdings Corp.</p>
      <p>Both companies have faced difficulties as the demand for printed documents and ink have waned.</p>
      <p>Xerox offered earlier this month to give HP shareholders $17 in cash and a fractional share of Xerox stock for each share they held in HP. They put the total value of the deal at $33.5 billion. If the deal had been completed, HP shareholders would own approximately 48% of the combined company.</p>
      <p>HP rejected the offer, saying that it has “great confidence” in its ability to deliver long-term value. Its board also said it had “significant questions” about the trajectory of Xerox’s business and prospects, particularly given a recent decline in its revenue.</p>
      <p>A representative for Xerox, which is based in Norwalk, Connecticut, could not be reached immediately for comment.</p>
