      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - When he met Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson on the field following a 41-7 defeat that was still too fresh to process, the Houston’s Deshaun Jackson swapped uniform tops with his fellow quarterback.</p>
      <p>Watson scrawled a signature on his No. 4 jersey for Jackson, then embellished his autograph with a message that could serve as a warning for a league that is still trying to figure out how to defend the Ravens’ dual threat.</p>
      <p>“I just wrote, ‘Always love, keep going, keep grinding.’ I wrote ‘MVP’ on it,” Watson said. “He’s like a brother to me. I’m proud of him. That’s what I told him.”</p>

      <p>A game billed as a head-to-head battle of two multi-dimensional quarterbacks never materialized. Instead, Jackson outplayed Watson from the outset, the veteran never able to catch up to the youngster.</p>
      <p>Houston gave up seven sacks to a Baltimore defense that had collared opposing quarterbacks only 16 times over its first nine games. Watson was harried and hurried, unable to mount a comeback against a Baltimore onslaught that just kept picking up steam.</p>

      <p>Not only was Watson limited to 169 yards passing, but he lost a fumble, threw an interception and gained only 12 yards on three carries.</p>
      <p>“They just played hard,” Watson said of the Ravens. “They had a scheme up front. That was pretty much it.”</p>
      <p>He took the loss in stride, saying the Texans would “flush it and move forward” and immediately start focusing on a short week of preparation for Thursday night’s home game against the Colts.</p>
      <p>“For me, a loss is a loss,” Watson said when asked if a rout was harder to digest than a narrow defeat. “We could have went back and forth, it could have been 41-42 and a loss and still be disappointing.”</p>

        <p>Coming in, the Texans (6-4) had won four of five. Watson was playing like an MVP.</p>
        <p>And then, well, Houston and its standout quarterback had one of those days you’d like to forget (or “flush”).</p>
        <p>“I’ve had a lot of success and I’ve had a lot of failures. Every great quarterback has - Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers,” Watson said. “They’re going to have their days and they will continue to. The criticism will still come. I can go out there Thursday and light it up and everyone’s back talking highly about me.”</p>
        <p>After this game, everyone was talking about Jackson, who threw four touchdown passes and ran for 86 yards.</p>
        <p>“He’s as good as advertised,” Texans cornerback Johnathan Joseph said. “Obviously, he made a lot of plays with his legs. He made a couple of throws. He did what he was supposed to do.”</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Texans, they don’t have to lament long about this dud of a performance. First place in the AFC South will be on the line when Indy comes to town.</p>
        <p>“A quick turnaround, so you really can’t linger on (this loss) too long,” linebacker Zach Cunningham said. “It’s definitely a plus for us.”</p>
        <p>If the Texans play well, this defeat won’t matter nearly as much. This much is certain:</p>
        <p>“We can’t come out and do the same thing that we did today,” nose tackle D.J. Reader said.</p>
