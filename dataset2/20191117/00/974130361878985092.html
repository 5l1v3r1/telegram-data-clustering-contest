      <p>Carlow champions St Mullins have secured passage to the Leinster final, coming away with the win over Rathdowney-Errill in the most dramatic circumstances.</p>
      <p>It was a cracking game of hurling, contested between two good sides. It was nip and tuck throughout, with the result ultimately being decided in injury time.</p>
      <p>Paddy Purcell got the opening goal of the game, showing great skill to bounce the ball off the ground and bury it beyond the opposition goalkeeper.</p>

      <p>St Mullins would reply straight away, going right up the other end of the pitch to raise a green flag of their own.</p>

      <p>They would get their second goal of the game five minutes before the interval.</p>

      <p>The teams would trade scores throughout the second period, with the two sides deadlocked as the clock ticked over to 60 minutes thanks to this James Doyle point.</p>

      <p>The same player would then come up with the moment of brilliance to decide the game, flicking the ball over an opposition defender and notching the winning point.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game Doyle dedicated the win to to team selector Michael Ryan, <a href="https://www.balls.ie/gaa/st-mullins-selector-michael-ryan-ill-cuala-419789">who took ill</a> during the big win over Cuala in the last round.</p>

      <blockquote>I'd say he's a happy man now! To be honest with you, this is all for him. He's a great club man and I'd say he's delighted up there now In Dublin.<br/>This is definitely all for him.</blockquote>
      <p>St Mullins have now booked their first ever provincial final place, becoming only the second Carlow team to reach a Leinster decider. They will face reigning All-Ireland champions Ballyhale Shamrocks who will no doubt be strong favourites.</p>
      <p>The Carlow club have already upset the odds once in this championship, defeating the Dublin champions in the quarter final. They will be hoping they have one more upset in them.</p>
