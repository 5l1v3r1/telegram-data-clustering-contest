      <h1>Hilton gives employees a month off to help others</h1>

      <p>Hilton has announced the winners of a programme that lets its employees take a sabbatical in order to do their dream charitable endeavour.</p>
      <p>As well as four weeks paid time off, the Hilton Thrive Sabbatical gives the group $5,000 each towards their goal.</p>
      <p>The winners include Hiro Hsu, director of operations at Hilton Chengdu, who will bike across Australian bush country raising money for a charity that supports youth education and underprivileged children; Cassie Neidhart, HR director at Hilton San Diego Bayfront, who will deliver care packages to chemo patients from San Diego to Memphis; and Roger McCall, a doorman at Hilton Sydney, who will volunteer at an orphanage and teach English.</p>
      <p>The programme is open to all hotel and corporate employees.</p>
      <p>“Every day at Hilton, our passionate team members contribute to the Hilton Effect, creating a positive impact on our guests, on their fellow team members and in their communities,” said Matt Schuyler, Hilton’s chief human resources officer.</p>
      <p>“Over the past two years, we have been inspired by the life-changing experiences our Sabbatical winners have pursued for themselves and cultivated for others.”</p>
      <p>“It is our privilege to support them in pursuing their dreams and being the positive change they want to see in the world.”</p>
      <p>A previous Hilton Thrive Sabbatical recipient was Mira Macud, pictured above, an administrative assistant at Conrad Dubai.</p>
      <p>Eleven years ago, Mira left her home country of the Philippines to work in Dubai so she could send money home to her deaf son.</p>
      <p>During her sabbatical, she returned home to learn American Sign Language at the Philippine School for the Deaf, allowing her to have a conversation with her now 15-year-old son for the first time.</p>
      <p>She spent the allowance on hundreds of meals for volunteers at the school and built a relationship with the team at Conrad Manila, who offered her a position at the property so she could live with her son again.</p>
