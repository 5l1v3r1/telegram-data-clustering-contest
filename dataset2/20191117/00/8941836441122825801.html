      <p>With their bye week coming in Week 12, the Vikings cautiously held out four starters, including receiver Adam Thielen (hamstring), for their home game against Denver.</p>
      <p>Also listed as inactive for Minnesota were right guard Josh Kline (concussion), nose tackle Linval Joseph (knee) and safety Anthony Harris (groin). Thielen has played in only the first quarter in two of the past five games.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington/">Washington</a> safety Montae Nicholson is active. Nicholson was involved in a situation early Thursday morning when he dropped a 21-year-old woman off at a hospital. She died at the hospital of a drug overdose.</p>
      <p>Nicholson, who missed the past two games with an ankle injury, practiced Friday. The team says it is cooperating with officials.</p>
