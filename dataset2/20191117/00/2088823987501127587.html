      <p>With a falling rate of gun violence, Buffalo is a safer city today than in years past. Several factors have contributed to that welcome change, but chief among them is smarter policing.</p>
      <p>Through the end of summer, the number of people shot in Buffalo was the lowest in at least nine years. Driving the statistic are the city’s commitment to community policing, a police new unit focused on non-fatal shootings, responsible business owners and concerned citizens and citizens’ advocates.</p>
      <p>Among the most hopeful signs is a rising rate of success in solving non-fatal shootings. It’s a category of crime that has stymied the efforts of police departments across the country.</p>
      <p>As with most progress, improvement comes from a combination of factors. The emphasis on community policing by Mayor Byron W. Brown and Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood has made a big difference. So has community outreach by both those officials. Together, those efforts have produced greater cooperation between residents and law enforcement, a development that improves the chances of solving crimes and, perhaps, even of deterring them.</p>
      <p>The Buffalo Police Department’s Neighborhood Engagement Team, as part of its mission, is to engage the community and not just when there is a crime. The team has ridden in bike rodeos, played soccer games, hosted job fairs and attended block group meetings. With that familiarity comes increased trust.</p>
      <p>Shootings have declined overall but, unfortunately, not in every pocket of the city. As a recent News analysis showed, gun violence has continued to plague the Schiller Park neighborhood near the Cheektowaga border over the last 8½ years, when an average of one person has been shot each month.</p>
      <p>That’s troubling and deserves the focus of police. But the citywide trend is heartening. You wouldn’t want to be one of the 119 people shot in Buffalo through the end of August, but it’s the lowest eight-month total in at least nine years, based on Police Department statistics.</p>
      <p>It’s a 28% decrease in people shot compared to the average of the same period from 2011 through 2018. It is also a 29% drop compared with the same period last year. The hard work by the Buffalo Police Department and community is beginning to pay off in the most hopeful way possible: in lives saved.</p>
      <p>Police cite those community-communications efforts, along with engaging with those who fall into one of three categories: people whom police believe are involved in group violence; those who carry guns; and vulnerable people who associate with dangerous individuals.</p>
      <p>Still, there is that slice of the Schiller Park neighborhood. It accounts for less than a quarter of a square mile but its gun violence has been the city’s worst since the beginning of 2011. The number of people shot and those dying of their injuries is devastating for such a small parcel.</p>
      <p>The high incidence of shootings has seeped beyond Schiller Park, with the city’s highest shooting rates showing up in other areas along Genesee Street. Yet even those living and working in the Schiller Park neighborhood, while acknowledging the reality of gun violence, also see evidence that the area seems poised to turn around.</p>
      <p>Take a ride into Schiller Park’s main commercial area. There, you’d find the Save A Lot grocery store, a church, a barbershop, a photography studio, a custom T-shirt store and restaurants. Together, they offer a picture of promise.</p>
      <p>Yes, some neighbors are concerned and wisely take precautions, but the combination of efforts by residents and police is paying off. It shows that, like the rest of Buffalo, the East Side is also on the rise.</p>
