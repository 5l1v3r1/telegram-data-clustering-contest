      <p>Heading into Sunday's Champions Cup game against Montpellier, Connacht were already without Tiernan O’Halloran, Tom Farrell, Kieran Marmion, Quinn Roux and Gavin Thornbury. Shortly before kick-off at the Sportsground, there were further blows with Jarrad Butler, Matt Healy and Niyi Adeolokun also ruled out.</p>
      <p>Despite those absentees and conceding a try after 70 seconds, Connacht dug deep and defeated the French side 23-20.</p>
      <p>"It was a disappointed camp on Monday when we came in after [losing to] Leinster," Man of the Match Caolin Blade told BT Sport after the game.</p>
      <blockquote>A lot of character was questioned. It's a total different team out there this week and I'm chuffed for the lads.<br/>In the first half, we tried to play with a bit too much tempo. We tried to move them around and nearly did it too much.<br/>At half-time, we just spoke about not forcing those 50-50s. It's credit to the lads. I think there was three minutes of pick and goes there, it was well worth it.<br/>Everyone classes us as a wind and rain team. I think the style of rugby we play, we love sunshine. If we have any more of these, we'll get displays like that.</blockquote>
      <p>Scrum-half Blade scored Connacht's third try of the game 12 minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>"Bundee [Aki] said if I didn't pass to him, he was going to give out to me," said Blade. "I just took it myself and we'll sort it out after."</p>
      <p>Connacht travel to Toulouse for their second game next weekend.</p>
      <p>"We're afraid of nothing in this competition - we have nothing to lose," added Blade of facing the Top 14's reigning champions.</p>
