      <p>NYPD divers rescued a 59-year-old kitesurfer tangled in his own netting — and struggling in the ocean Saturday afternoon in Queens, police said.</p>
      <p>The man was spotted by a passerby who saw him flailing in the waters near Breezy Point in Rockaway at about 1:30 p.m. and called 911, police said.</p>
      <p>“He was completely tangled up in the lines,” said Sgt. Mark DiRenzo, who co-piloted the helicopter that rushed to the man’s aide.</p>
      <p>DiRenzo and his co-pilot, Officer Robert Glennon, hovered the aircraft about 100 feet above the stranded surfer and lowered the two scuba divers into the water, NYPD diver Michael Guida told The Post.</p>
      <p>“He was stuck, and he couldn’t get free,” Guida said, adding the the November water is chilly and the current. “There was a significant wind and some chop in that area.”</p>

      <p>Guida and his fellow diver, Officer Tyler Phillips, were able to untangle with man and hoist him into the helicopter less than 20 minutes later, he said.</p>
      <p>The quick-moving team returned the man — and his yellow surfboard — safely to shore, where he refused medical attention.</p>
      <p>“He said he was okay. He wasn’t in too much stress, other than the fact that he was entangled,” said Guida.</p>
