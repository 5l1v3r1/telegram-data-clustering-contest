      <p>The following are key facts on the canal: <br/><br/>- The Suez Canal is an artificial double waterway extending over 193 kilometers and connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. <br/><br/>- Vertically, the canal is divided into eastern and southern sections of Bitter Lakes, while horizontally, it is cross cut by double passages. <br/>- The canal saves ships 15 days compared with Cape of Good Hope. <br/><br/>- The idea of digging up the canal rose for the first time amid the advent of French Campaign in Egypt and Syria in 1798. <br/><br/>- In 1854, Ferdinand de Lesseps persuaded Khedive Said of embarking on the project and was granted the Suez Canal digging and operation concession for 99 years.</p>

      <p>- The canal was dug between 1859 and 1869 by around 1 million Egyptians. Of those, more than 120,000 died while working because of hunger, thirst, epidemics, and abuse.</p>

      <p>- In July 1956, late President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal. The response to the decision was the tripartite aggression by Britain, France, and Israel. However, they retreated due to international pressure and popular resistance. <br/><br/>- The canal was shut down for more than 8 years because of the Six-Day War in 1967 and was reopened by late President Anwar al-Saddat in 1975 after resolving the conflict with Israel and achieving ceasefire following October 6, 1973 War.</p>
