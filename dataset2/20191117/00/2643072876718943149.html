      <p>Former President Goodluck Jonathan’s kinsmen in Kolo, Ogbia LGA, of Bayelsa State, on Saturday, trooped out to celebrate the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ward 9.</p>
      <p>Members of Kolo community hit the streets immediately the results of the 13 units in Ward 9 were announced by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and the All Progressives Congress (APC) was declared the winner of the ward.</p>
      <p>Jonathan’s kinsmen said they were given as much as N10,000 by agents of the PDP but rejected the money because they were united and determined to vote in APC.</p>
      <p><i>“We are happy because we won the PDP in all the units,”</i> one of them, who failed to mention his name out of excitement said.</p>
      <p>Also in Eppie-Atissa in Yenagoa, residents took over the road celebrating over the defeat of the PDP in the area.</p>
