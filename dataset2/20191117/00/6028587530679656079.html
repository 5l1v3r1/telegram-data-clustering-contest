      <p>Of the many factors which contributed to the Denver Nuggets’ success last season, one which stood out brightly was the strong performance by their bench. As both a stabilizing force throughout Denver’s many injury woes and a cauldron of energy to crank things into high gear when the starters were struggling, Denver’s reserves were instrumental in propelling the team to its surprising second-place finish in the Western Conference. At face value, the Nuggets have kept their winning ways rolling along this season, with a current record of eight wins and three losses which places them third in the West and sixth in the league, and has them on pace to top the 54 wins they logged last season. Through the early part of their 2019-20 campaign, however, the Nuggets have actually performed below the level their record would imply.</p>
      <p>Some of this is evidenced in the numbers, which paint a potentially worrisome picture. Cleaning the Glass, Ben Falk’s superb NBA statistics resource, tracks an “expected wins” metric which estimates the number of wins a team should be expected to get based on its net efficiency in terms of points scored per 100 possessions. Despite having the sixth-best winning percentage in the league, Denver is 12th in overall efficiency with a net rating of plus-1.2. Accordingly, their expected win total to date is 6.2, two less than their actual eight wins, and their current efficiency level projects them out to 46.3 wins on the season, a far cry below the 59-60 wins their current .727 record would net in 82 games.</p>
      <p>Denver’s slew of comeback victories this season – they have come from behind after trailing by 12 or more points in five of their eight wins – has fueled a lot of excitement, but is also symptomatic of the speed bumps they’ve been hitting so far.</p>
      <p>In actuality, the list of disappointing developments for the Nuggets this season has been surprisingly long in light of their solid record. From a struggling franchise superstar in Nikola Jokic (whether due to malaise, poor conditioning or both), to team-wide shooting struggles to a general inability to get the offense clicking at the high level they’ve proven capable of, more often than not the Nuggets just haven’t completely looked quite right this season.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the most unexpected issue to plague Denver so far has been the near disappearance of their bench production. Everything had pointed to the Nuggets having one of the best benches in the league. Their strong roster continuity, the increased depth added by offseason trade acquisition Jerami Grant and the continued development of their younger reserves like Malik Beasley and Monte Morris all suggested Denver would once again have a formidable second unit.</p>
      <p>That may still come to pass, but until the Nuggets’ bench surged to play a key part in Denver’s “yet another comeback” win over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, as a whole they’ve struggled to deliver this season, while the starters have almost exclusively done the heavy lifting. And while Denver should get some credit for their resiliency in staging all those comebacks, having a second unit which consistently goes M.I A. is not a sustainable formula for success.</p>
      <p>Through their first 10 games, the Nuggets’ starters have had a plus-minus per 100 possessions of plus-7.6, third best in the NBA among all teams’ first stringers, per NBA.com. Their bench, by contrast, was dead last in the league at minus-6.7 through the same set of games. That’s down from a plus-4.0 which was eighth best in the league in 2018-19, and higher for most of the year until some late-season slippage.</p>
      <p>Denver’s bench stepped up on Friday with their most impactful performance of the season, finishing with a single-game net rating of 6.1 which topped the starters’ 5.1 net, and showing some big signs of renewed life as Mason Plumlee, Monte Morris, Jerami Grant and Juancho Hernangomez all made big contributions to Denver’s scrappy comeback.</p>
      <p>The question now, however, will be whether that’s the spark that finally sets this season’s Nuggets bench production alight, or whether it was just a one-off fluke.</p>
      <p>Getting answers to that in the short term may prove somewhat difficult. Starting small forward Will Barton is listed as questionable to play in tonight’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies, and if he sits there will be a ripple effect throughout the bench unit as one player gets the starting nod, likely Hernangomez or Torrey Craig. Beasley has also missed the two games with illness, and only averaged about six minutes in the two games prior to that, but should be available to play tonight.</p>
      <p>Head coach Michael Malone is pursuing a potential solution to the Nuggets’ bench struggles by abandoning Denver’s “hockey style” all-starter/all-bench rotations in favor of integrating more reserve players amongst the starters to give them a boost. “I have to find a way to help our second unit find their way, get them easier shots and find them confidence so we aren’t so reliable on that starting unit,” Malone commented before the Nets game <a href="https://theathletic.com/1374156/2019/11/13/when-we-go-to-our-bench-we-need-something-from-them-why-the-nuggets-second-unit-is-struggling/">according to</a> The Athletic’s Kendra Andrews.</p>
      <p>If changing up the rotations sparks the return of the bench to last season’s level of production, it will be great news for a Nuggets team which can’t afford to fight their way back from behind in too many games if they are to compete for a top seed in the West. And the signs of life from the last game point to things taking a turn in the right direction, especially if Morris and Plumlee, the bookends of the second unit, can build momentum off their recent success.</p>
