      <p>Nov. 16 (UPI) -- Five people are dead and one injured after a man shot dead his estranged wife and three children before turning the gun on himself in San Diego on Saturday morning, police said.</p>
      <p>"As a husband and a father, this instance is very difficult for me to even think about," San Diego police chief David Nisleit at a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Multiple-People-Injured-in-Shooting-in-Paradise-Hills-SDPD-565039022.html">news conference</a> on Saturday afternoon. "As hard as it is to share this news we want to reassure the neighbors and the community that we are not looking for a suspect. This was a domestic dispute involving one family."</p>
      <p>Nisleit said at the family's request, police are withholding the names of the individuals involved.</p>
      <p>At 6:49 a.m., police said they received a 911 call from a residence in the Paradise Hills neighborhood of San Diego. The caller did not speak, but the dispatcher could hear yelling in the background.</p>
      <p>Police made their way to the scene after they heard a second 911 call from a neighbor calling to say he heard arguing and what sounded like a nail gun firing.</p>

      <p>Officers found the bodies of a 31-year-old man, a 29-year-old and a 3-year-old boy. Three boys, 5, 9 and 11 were transported to a local hospital, where two died, according to Lt. Matt Hobbs of the San Diego Police Department's homicide division. The 11-year-old is still in the hospital and immediately underwent emergency surgery.</p>
      <p>Hobbs said the adult victim obtained a restraining order against the shooter Friday. "We do not know if the suspect had been served but we do believe he was aware of it," Hobbs said.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place inside a guest house adjacent to a home owned by other relatives. It is not clear how many people lived on the property,</p>
      <p>The San Diego Union-Tribune <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-11-16/san-diego-police-investigating-paradise-hills-shooting">reported</a> that police were last called to keep the peace at the house Nov. 1 when the estranged husband had arrived to ask his wife for tools at the house.</p>
      <p>Counseling is being provided to the first responders who arrived at the scene, Nisleit said.</p>
