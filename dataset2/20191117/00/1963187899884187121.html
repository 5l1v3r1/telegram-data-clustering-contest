      <p>CAIRO - 17 November 2019: Archaeologists have discovered a 2,200-year-old temple in Egypt. It is believed to belong to Ptolemy IV Philopator of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. <br/><br/>The structure of the ancient cemetery was found by chance as excavators supplied sewage lines to the village of Kom Ashqaw in the city of Tama, north of Sohag, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities' posts on its official Facebook page. <br/><br/>A team of researchers have uncovered a north-south wall and a wall directed east to west, in addition to the southwest corner of the temple structure, engraved with inscriptions of Hapi; the Nile god of the ancient Egyptians, carrying sacrifices surrounded by birds and flowers. Archaeologists are working to save the remains of the temple on the west bank of the Nile.</p>

      <p>Ptolemy IV Philopator is believed to have ruled Egypt from about 221 BC to 204 BC. His rule was not successful, as he was more interested in pursuing works of art than in governance issues. Ancient texts suggest that the pharaoh built the largest manpower ship ever, the galley, which is a type of oar ship that consists of 40 rows of oars, used by 4,000 people. <br/><br/>The discovery of the ancient temple is the latest in a series of archaeological discoveries in 2019. <br/><br/>The United Nations tourist attractions report published in August 2018 confirmed that Egypt had the fastest growth rate as a tourist destination in 2017 by a 55.1 percent increase in the number of international arrivals that year. <br/><br/>Important discoveries also include eight mummies from the Ptolemy dynasty (323--30 BC) covered with brightly decorated sarcophagi in Dahshur Cemetery near Giza and the stone sphinx in Kom Ombo, in addition to a riverside temple near Aswan dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek. This is in addition to the discovery of a 4,400-year old tomb in the archaeological site of Saqqara.</p>
