      <h1>Connacht Overcome Nightmare Start To Pull Off Brilliant Win Against Montpellier</h1>

      <p>Connacht overcame several injuries and the concession of a try after 70 seconds against Montpellier to claim a brilliant home win in their opening Champions Cup game of the season.</p>
      <p>Prior to the match, it was announced that Jarrad Butler, Matt Healy and Niyi Adeolokun had all picked up injuries and would be replaced in the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>Those blows were compounded even further when Aaron Cruden touched down in the second minute of the game. It was a nightmare start for Connacht.</p>
      <p>The Top 14 team maintained a seven-point advantage for much of the half. However, with three minutes left in the opening 40, Connacht hit back with two quickfire tries.</p>
      <p>The first came from backrow Peter Boyle and the second hooker Tom McCartney and meant they led 13-10 at the break.</p>

      <p>Connacht extended their lead even further after 12 minutes of the second half when scrum-half Caolin Blade made a burst to score his team's third try of the game.</p>
      <p>However, Montpellier hit back ten minutes later through a superb run from Anthony Bouthier. The fullback crossed the whitewash and saw his try converted to level the game at 20-20.</p>
      <p>With just over 15 minutes to play, out-half Jack Carty was replaced by 22-year-old Conor Fitzgerald. He was on the pitch just two minutes when he kicked what turned out to be the winning score.</p>
