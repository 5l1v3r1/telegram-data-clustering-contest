        <figcaption>PRESTON NEW ROAD, PRESTON, LANCASHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM - 2018/06/28: Two local Anti Frack Protesters ... [+] hold placards on a main road to highlight the claims that Fracking causes contamination of water, air, land and the food chain, during mass protests outside a Shale Gas Companies Fracking Site. "Reclaim the Power" a UK based 'Direct Action' group fighting for social, environmental and economic justice, together with local Anti-Fracking Protesters shut down the Shale Gas Company "Cuadrilla's" Fracking operations for an entire 48 Hours from 28th to 30th June 2018. Drilling was disrupted and no supply or contractors vehicles were able to leave or enter the entire site.

      <p>The United Kingdom’s conservative government has issued a temporary ban on shale gas production, forcing the rest of the world to take notice. While the UK’s leaders have supported such development, its energy department now has reservations because it worries that “fracking” may lead to tremors. In the United States, natural gas has become the path of least resistance because it is plentiful and cheap. To that end, it is replacing coal for electric generation and helping to reduce the country’s carbon emissions. It is also being used as a feedstock for the manufacturing and chemical industries. </p>
      <p>Overseas, though, it has not gotten as friendly a welcome. Most progressive Democrats running for president of the United States have similar concerns. Moderate Democrats, in contrast, see natural gas as a bridge fuel until the point where green energies can supply much of the nation’s electricity needs. As such, they favor reasonable controls on drilling — things like requiring companies to disclose what chemicals they are pumping into the earth. </p>
      <p>And all this stands in sharp contrast to the polices of the Trump administration, which is to tear down nearly all regulations and to open up more public lands to development. In all, the <a href="http://potentialgas.org/">Potential Gas Committee</a> says that there are 3,374 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of technically recoverable natural gas resources. </p>
      <p>Fracking is formally known as hydraulic fracturing. And it is the technique used to break the shale oil and natural gas from rocks deep below the earth’s surface. To do so, chemicals, sand and water are used. And critics are complaining that it has the potential to foul drinking water supplies while also increasing carbon emissions. </p>
      <p>As for the UK, energy ministers have based their decision on a <a href="https://www.ogauthority.co.uk/onshore/onshore-reports-and-data/preston-new-road-pnr-1z-hydraulic-fracturing-operations-data/">report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA)</a>, which said that the experts can’t predict the probability or magnitude of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2014/05/06/shale-oil-and-gas-potential-for-earthquakes-could-cause-sector-to-lose-footing/#3c8b835f1cb2">earthquakes linked to fracking operations</a>. The government has long been supportive of the industry, although it has made clear from the get-go that development could only go forth if the science shows that fracking is safe. And given recent “disturbances,” the government has announced a moratorium on fracking until the data suggested any differently.</p>
      <p>“Whilst acknowledging the huge potential of UK shale gas to provide a bridge to a zero carbon future, I’ve also always been clear that shale gas exploration must be carried out safely,” says Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom.  </p>
      <p>“In the UK, we have been led by the best available scientific evidence, and closely regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority, one of the best regulators in the world,” she adds. “After reviewing the OGA’s report … it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community. For this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England …”</p>

      <p>Will the UK’s decision have broader ramifications around the globe and specifically in the United States? Right now, fracking is banned in some European countries such as France and Ireland while Germany and the Netherlands have temporarily halted drilling. But the production method is also widely used in other countries such as Canada and China, with this country being the globe’s most dominant force. Still, New York and Maryland prohibit the drilling technique. </p>
      <p>Among the Democratic presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have said they would outlaw fracking altogether. But will this sell in a general election? </p>
      <p>Americans may not favor unfettered drilling with limited oversight but natural gas has become too important to the domestic economy. In 2000, shale gas accounted for 5 percent of all gas production in the United States and today, it is about 60 percent, according to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=907&amp;t=8">U.S. Energy Information Administration.</a> The natural gas and oil industry supported 10.3 million U.S. jobs and added $1.3 trillion to the nation’s economy in 2015, notes the American Petroleum Institute. </p>
      <p>A few of the major drillers are Exxon Mobil Corp., Chesapeake Energy, Anadarko, Equitable Resources and Range Resources. The biggest shale plays in the country include the Permian Basin in West Texas, Eagle Ford in southern Texas, the Marcellus basin in the eastern United States, the Barnett basin in Texas, the Bakken in Montana and North Dakota and the Utica in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/hfstudy/recordisplay.cfm?deid=332990">Environmental Protection Agency</a> under the Obama administration found that fracking can impact drinking water in some circumstances such as when there are declining ground water resources and when there would be any spillage of the chemicals used to extract the oil or natural gas. Also, wells that are too shallow may prove unsafe. Generally, though, EPA found that there is no “widespread, systemic impact” on drinking water. The agency also says that a deep infusion of brine – linked to the earthquakes – is preferable to other disposal methods that include treating it at wastewater plants. Prior to re-injection, the brine was stored at surface pits.</p>
      <p>A Yale University study aligns with that of the EPA. A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2015/06/22/natural-gas-revolution-stakes-are-too-high-to-fail/#71f0e2b17cc7">Harvard University</a> study says that the potential for natural gas is too great and that a middle ground must be found.</p>
      <p>“Policies that promote the responsible development of our nation’s vast energy resources aren’t solely economic, but also further U.S. security and environmental stewardship,” says Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute. Increased use of clean-burning natural gas for power generation and technology innovations have reduced U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to near 30-year lows today.” </p>
      <p>While natural gas is to be credited for helping to create jobs and to reduce emissions in this country, producers must still put the interest of local communities above all else. If not, they will experience the kind of backlash that is now taking place elsewhere in the world and specifically in the United Kingdom. </p>
