          <p>To curl your hair with a straightener, first brush your hair to remove any kinks or knots. Then, plug your straightener in and let it heat up. Grab a 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5 cm) section of your hair and pull it away from your head. Next, close the straightener’s clamps around the section of hair, about 6 inches (15 cm) from the roots. Twist the straightener 180 degrees in the direction that you want to curl your hair. Wrap the end of your hair around the outside of the straightener in the same direction that you turned it. Now, lightly pull the straightener away from your head. Hold the clamps gently together as you run it all the way through the ends of your hair. Finally, repeat this process on every other section of your hair that you want to curl.

            <p><b>1. Start with clean and dry hair.</b> Make sure to start with completely clean and dry hair. Wet hair won't curl at all and damp hair won't curl as well. Even if you have one of those magical wet-to-dry hair straighteners, it’s best if you have dry hair. Dirty hair also won’t hold its shape very well, so make sure you’ve washed it in the past 24 hours.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you're blow-drying your hair first, use mousse. The extra volume will keep your hair from looking too flat as you curl it.</li>

                <p><b>2. Use a thin flat iron.</b> Your straightener should be about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) in width from plate to handle and have rounded edges, otherwise, it won’t form smooth curls. A flat, paddle-style iron also won't do curls. It’ll be much harder to hold and wrap if you have this kind of straightener and the hair won’t want to stay in the right place.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

                      <p>Make sure you’ve got a good quality flat iron. The best work faster, make your hair smoother and do less damage than poor-quality irons. They can have a big impact on things like shine and the consistency of curls.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Heat the iron up to the minimum temperature you need for your hair. If your hair is fine and thin, stick to the low end of the dial at below 300 degrees. Normal hair can be ironed at 300 to 380. You can turn it up to 350 to 400 if your hair tends to be thick, coarse, or frizzy.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-4">[4]</a></sup></li>

                      <p><b>3. Apply heat protectant.</b> Applying a heat protectant or a thermal spray creates a protective barrier between the hair and the iron so that the hair doesn't "frizzle" and burn. Spray all over your hair – no need to comb, as it should mist on and dry quickly.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

                        <li>If you have thick hair, spray it on each section before you tackle it. If you just spray it on the top of all your hair, it won’t hit the bottom layers.</li>
                        <li>Also be sure to comb out any tangles in your hair before applying heat.</li>

                          <p><b>4.

Tie up the hair above your ears and put it in a bun on the top of your head. It needs to be out of the way.</p>

A good rule is to work with 1 to 2 inch sections at a time. Pinup the rest.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-7">[7]</a></sup></li>
                              <li>Once that layer is done, you'll unclip your hair and let down another layer. Again, clip up what you can't curl right now. Keep curling in layers.</li>

                                        <p><i>Flicks</i>: Start half-way down the length of hair, clamp the iron closed and turn it back on itself in a half turn. You should now have created a U-shape with the hair and the iron. Keeping the iron on that half-turn angle, slowly move it down the hair shaft to the end of the hair. The faster you move the iron, the less pronounced the curl/flick will be. If you like big soft flicks, slow down your iron.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>

                                                            <li>Larger sections result in bouncier, looser curls that look a little more natural. Use sections that are wider than two inches for big curls.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Your-Hair-with-a-Flat-Iron#_note-14">[14]</a></sup></li>
                                                            <li>Mix it up. You don't have to stick completely to one size or another. For instance, you could do larger curls close to your face and the top of your head to create lift and volume, and tighter, more delicate curls underneath for support. Try it a few different ways and see what you like best.</li>

Use one of the above techniques.</b> The above methods share the same basic principles: turn your hair straightener over itself, and lightly and slowly drag it down your hair. Clamp lightly keeping the hair on the straightener plates – not so hard it's difficult to move and not so lightly that the hair escapes.</p>
                                                            <ul>
                                                            <li>The variables you can switch up? Where you start on your hair (towards your scalp or towards the ends), how slowly you move the flat iron, and how much you rotate the flat iron. Experiment with these three variables to find the perfect look for you.</li>
                                                            <li>You don't have to curl all your hair, either. A few strands that are straighter or just wavy can give you a natural, beach-y look.</li>
