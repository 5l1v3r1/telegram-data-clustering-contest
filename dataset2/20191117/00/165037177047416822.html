        <b>Antoine Griezmann got a goal and an assist as Albania's first game at their new stadium ended in defeat. France beat them 0-2 in Tirana to claim first place in Group H of Euro 2020 qualifying.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Sunday, world champions <b>France wrapped up top spot in Group H</b> as goals from <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/c-tolisso-186760">Corentin Tolisso</a> and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-griezmann-32465">Antoine Griezmann</a> sealed a 2-0 win over Albania in Tirana.</p>
      <p>The French national anthem was roundly booed before kick-off <b>as retribution for the error that saw the Andorran anthem played</b> instead of the Albanian one when the teams met in September at the Stade de France.</p>
      <p>The visitors made a quick start on the pitch, though, as Bayern Munich midfielder <b>Tolisso headed Griezmann's free-kick into the bottom corner</b>.</p>

      <p><b>The Barcelona star slotted in the second himself</b> on the half-hour mark, before the dead rubber petered out in the second period, with Olivier Giroud going closest to a third by striking the post.</p>
      <p>The other games in the group saw <b>Turkey</b>,<b> </b>who had also already sealed qualification,<b> beat Andorra 2-0, while Iceland edged to a 2-1 victory</b> at Moldova.</p>
