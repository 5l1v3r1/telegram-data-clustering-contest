      <p><b>Belgian</b> second division club, KVC Westerlo, have announced on their website that they have terminated their contract with former Nigeria international, Emmanuel Emenike, who joined the club in September.</p>
      <p>The club said they decided to part ways with the 32-year-old because he failed to live up to expectations.</p>
      <p> “Emmanuel Emenike and KVC Westerlo have decided in mutual agreement to end their collaboration. Despite the many efforts made by both parties in the best understanding, the player could not be brought to the level that both parties had intended,” read a statement on the club’s website.</p>
      <p>“In those circumstances, it was appropriate to end the agreement with a good feeling. KVC Westerlo wants to thank Emmanuel for choosing and trusting the club and the player wishes to thank the club for the opportunity he was offered to them.”</p>
      <p>Emenike made five league appearances for the club and failed to find the back of the net.</p>
      <p>The 2013 Africa Cup of Nations winner has had stints with clubs in South Africa, Greece, Turkey, England and Spain.</p>
      <p>Emenike joined Westerlo on trials in August and signed a deal with the club a month later – precisely on September 16.</p>
