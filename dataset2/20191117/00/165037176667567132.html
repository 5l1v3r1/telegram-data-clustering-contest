        <b>Fede Valverde and Carlos Henrique Casemiro form an indestructible pairing in the Madrid midfield. When the two are playing, it makes Madrid stronger both in attack and defence.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a> are progressing well as the matches go by. After a hesitant start and several bumps, Los Blancos are starting to get back on track.</p>
      <p>The facelift came against Galatasaray at the Santiago Bernabéu. They played extremely well against the Turkish outfit.</p>
      <p>The next victim was <b>Eibar</b>, who conceded 4 goals against an angry Madrid who were hungry for goals. This improvement is due in part to Casemiro and Valverde.</p>

      <p>Both have been capable of uniting and forming a total footballer in midfield. Real Madrid have better stats in <b>both attack and defence</b> when they are playing.</p>
      <p>So far this season, they have played together on 7 occasions, with Madrid scoring<b> 22 goals </b>and only<b> conceding 2</b>.</p>
      <p>But it doesn't stop there. <b>Madrid haven't even lost </b>when both of them have been playing. <b>The chemistry</b> between the Uruguayan and the Brazilian is real and this could suit Zidane well with eyes on the 'Clásico'.</p>
