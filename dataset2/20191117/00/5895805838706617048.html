      <p>Your flight is canceled, you make a stupid remark at a staff meeting, or you're running late for a job interview—out of the blue you're thinking about your ex and are suddenly filled with regret.</p>
      <p>The list can go on and on. This is the stuff of the problems that we get upset or frustrated about, anguish over, rant about, feel overwhelmed about, especially when we’re in the middle of it. This is the stuff we complain to our friends, our partners, our colleagues, ourselves about. If life is in the details, it doesn’t take much detail for life to suck.</p>
      <p>But hold on. Yes, you are free to see your life as an endless list of disasters, that the world, life, is definitely out to get you, the past to haunt you, but that doesn’t make it a good way to live. Part of managing life is learning how to manage your reactions, emotions, and stress. And an essential element of this managing is having perspective: not seeing every new problem as a new version of the end-of-the-world. The ability to step back and see the big picture.</p>
      <p>And perspective is easy to lose. Once you start to get upset, your upset brain does two things: It tells you that everything is important, and that the only way to feel better is to figure out the ultimate solution to the problem, enact it perfectly and do it now. Perspective goes out the window.</p>
      <p>The key here is getting out of your emotional brain and turning on your rational brain. This is where shifting perspective can help. You’re the brain gatekeeper and ideally, you want to be able to catch problems at the front door. Here are six questions to ask yourself to help you get settled and reoriented:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Is this a 1st-world problem or 3rd-world problem?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">Anxiety</a> produces tunnel vision where the canceled flight, the being late for a job interview becomes a Big Deal. It’s time to stop, take a deep breath and ask: First-world problem or 3rd-world problem? Third world is about life at its barest and most precarious, life and death. In the big picture, how big a deal, how important is this really?</p>
      <p>The key word here is <i>really</i>. On a scale of 1 to 10, the job interview may be a 6 or even a 7 because you only have one time to do it right, but it's not a 10, and most day-to-day anxieties are probably 2s or 3s. So slow down, deep breath: Is this is really a 3rd-world problem?</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. What's the best you can do?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You rebook the flight. You <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/forgiveness">apologize</a> for your remark at the staff meeting, you call from the road to let the job interviewers know you're unfortunately running late, and you duly apologize and explain when you get there: You've done the best you can do. You're done.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. What the worst that can happen?</b>
      </p>
      <p>But also ask yourself the complementary question: What’s the worst, the absolute worst that can happen? The worst is that you arrive late to your destination, some folks don't like your remark or gossip about you behind your back for a day or two, you don’t get the job. In the larger scheme of your life, are these really the absolute end of the world... really?</p>
      <p>By asking yourself the best you can do, the worst that can happen, you are defining what you can and cannot control. You can control you, hence the best you can do; you can't control the outcome of what you do, especially when it depends on others. But by practicing this way of thinking you also may discover through experience that there are few mistakes you can’t repair if you make the effort.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Will most people care?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, the interview people will, hence the apologies, mopping up; a few staff-meeting folks, maybe; but for most situations, no. Anxiety can cause us to fall back into little-kid thinking and feeling where we’re the center of the universe, where everyone is more powerful than us and are ready to pounce on our mistakes.</p>
      <p>The reality check is that we’re not the center of the universe, others are usually thinking more about themselves than they are ever likely to think about you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Will you regret this is a year, 5 years, 10 years?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the heat of the moment, time collapses and events seem permanent and life-changing. But the worry and sting of being late for the interview or for the staff-meeting comment, like losing the spelling-bee finals in the 3rd grade, eventually fades. Part of navigating life is coming to realize that even deep wounds heal over time, and if not, you can get help to create closure and put them to rest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Why now?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Years later you find yourself thinking about that job interview or the staff meeting or your ex, and the memories stir old and new emotions. Or on some days the fact that your partner is always leaving his briefcase on the dining room table just bugs you to death. Whenever issues arise from the past, whenever you have a problem that seems to go up and down in importance, the question to ask yourself is Why: why today and not yesterday?</p>
      <p>The answer is usually less about the past event, but more about you and your state of mind today. If you are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressed</a> about your job, your anxiety may seep into other areas of your everyday life, causing you to be annoyed by the briefcase, or mentally replaying that staff-meeting remark or the job interview. If you’ve had a recent loss, albeit relatively small — a first date that didn’t turn into a second date — that sense of loss may trigger thoughts about your ex and with it regrets.</p>
      <p>Rather than getting entangled in those feelings and memories, those pet peeves, use them as red flags letting you know the current emotional state of you. Time to pull out your first-aid toolbox to calm yourself down, change your mood. This is the antidote to your rumination. Once you feel more settled, look back at the problems and see what's left.</p>
      <p>The briefcase may fade in importance, as does the regret about your ex. But if not, take decisive action. Talk to your partner about finding a better home for the briefcase. Consider writing an email to your ex because your regret is really the tip of the iceberg of a huge block of regret that you've never reached closure on. Again, you can't control the outcome, but the outcome is less important than the action itself. You are moving forward on a real problem.</p>
      <p>Emotions bring texture to our lives, and anxiety serves to makes us sensitive to possible dangers. But when we become overwhelmed, when we begin to disasterize, it's time to regain balance and perspective, even before we begin to tackle the problem. This is a skill, and like other skills, it's a matter of practice.</p>
      <p>Time to<b> </b>start practicing?</p>
