      <p>Last year, Waldorf Astoria launched a Live Unforgettable campaign (#LiveUnforgettable), with a more localized and experienced-driven approach to luxury. New <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/waldorf-astoria/aston-martin/"><u>partnerships with brands like Aston Martin</u></a> and a renewed emphasis on a strong concierge team have brought this motto to life. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in Dubai, a young city of superlatives where anything seems possible and home to Waldorf Astoria's newest hotel. From racing the latest Aston Martins through the city to a private desert safari with sunset camel rides and falcon shows, the Waldorf Astoria team wants to make your dreams come true, like the genie in Aladdin.</p>

      <p>Waldorf Astoria operates 33 hotels and resorts globally, but Dubai is the only city with two Waldorfs, including the new <a href="https://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/uae/waldorf-astoria-dubai-international-financial-centre-DXBWAWA/index.html"><u>Waldorf Astoria Dubai International Financial Centre</u></a> that opened this summer. The 1960s Manhattan meets contemporary Middle Eastern property is a nice contrast in style and location to <a href="https://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/uae/waldorf-astoria-dubai-palm-jumeirah-DXBPDWA/index.html"><u>Waldorf Astoria Dubai Palm Jumeirah</u></a>, where between the extravagant spa and pool, guests don't want to leave the property. Another beachfront resort in <a href="https://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/uae/waldorf-astoria-ras-al-khaimah-RKTWAWA/index.html?WT.srch=1&amp;WT.mc_id=zIMDPDA0EMEA1MB2PSH3PPC_Google_search4cid991702541_aid50697000433_me_kkwd-4925029828725Brand_Nano6RKTWAWA7en&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_campaign=paidsearch&amp;campaignid=991702541&amp;adgroupid=50697000433&amp;targetid=kwd-492502982872&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5azI66fI5QIVE853Ch0sJARHEAAYASAAEgIdnPD_BwE"><u>Ras Al Khaimah</u></a> is the brand's third property in the United Arab Emirates, making for the highest concentration of Waldorf Astoria hotels in the world. It's a big investment for the storied American brand focused on building its international empire.</p>

      <p>“Dubai has probably the greatest concentration of luxury hotels in the world,” says Dino Michael, global brand head of Waldorf Astoria Hotels &amp; Resorts. “You've got to work even harder to keep your loyalty base with your guests and your team. There's always going to be another luxury hotel opening in Dubai, and you might try the latest and greatest, but you come back to where you get the service and guest recognition. That's what we focus on. We want to make our guests feel like our hotels are home for them.”</p>

      <p>At the Waldorf Astoria Dubai International Financial Centre, this includes 28 residential suites with full kitchens meant for longer stays. But when you're not in the mood to cook, they've resurrected <a href="https://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/uae/waldorf-astoria-dubai-international-financial-centre-DXBWAWA/amenities/restaurants.html"><u>Bull &amp; Bear</u></a>, the now-closed 1930s traditional steakhouse from Waldorf Astoria New York, with modern showmanship and innovation.</p>

      <p>The spa is small but mighty, with just four treatment suites, but these are not your typical spa suites. From a traditional hammam and Vichy shower to a spa bed of warm quartz pebbles and an I-SOPOD personal flotation tank, the array of treatments here is superb, using skincare lines like Amra, Aenea and Neom. Whether you're looking for indulgent pampering or a functional treatment to recover from jetlag, this spa seems to have it all. The covetable business location is also just five minutes from Dubai Mall, which is an especially big draw for Chinese and Middle Eastern guests visiting Dubai to shop.</p>

      <p>An hour north of Dubai along the coastline, Ras Al Khaimah is the northernmost emirate and over the past decade it has blossomed into a popular upscale resort destination for those looking for a real city escape further away than the Palm. Ras Al Khaimah's rise is thanks largely to Hilton's pioneering spirit beginning with its first hotel in 2001 and the warm sunny beaches and Al Hajar Mountains are especially popular among British, Russian, German and Nordic guests. Today, Waldorf Astoria is undoubtedly the region's grandest resort, adjacent to a championship golf course and boasting 10 restaurants and bars. Nearly half of the 346 guestrooms are suites, and even traditional guestrooms are incredibly spacious, hearkening to the property's original intended function as apartment-style housing for the Americas Cup.</p>
      <p>Michael says the intuitive, personalized service that Waldorf Astoria staff members are trained to provide – True Waldorf Service – is what sets the brand apart in a booming market. “Live Unforgettable is the alchemy of our True Waldorf Service, our iconic environments and our guests' desire to live in the moment,” Michael says. “When these three elements combine at a Waldorf Astoria property, every moment from the routine to the grand is transformed into the unforgettable. We want to help our guests be present in the moment, which feels more elusive than ever in today’s society.” </p>

      <p>According to the UNWTO World Tourism Barometer released by the World Tourism Council, the Middle East and Asia and the Pacific have seen the biggest growth in international tourists over the past year and mirroring that growth, Waldorf Astoria has recently opened properties not only in Dubai, but also China, Indonesia and the Maldives with nearly 10 more Middle East and Asia properties in the pipeline.</p>
      <p>“2020 will be a great year,” Michael says. “Everything will spike with Expo, but we are in it for the long term, with 20 to 30 year contracts with our owners.” If the number of cranes throughout the city is any indication, Dubai's wild growth shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
