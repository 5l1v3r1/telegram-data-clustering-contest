      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/oti-mabuse/">Oti Mabuse</a> has posted an emotional tribute to her dancing partner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kelvin-fletcher/">Kelvin Fletcher</a>, as it was revealed he had flown her mother out especially for tonight’s Blackpool show.</p>
      <p>What made it even more special was the fact that this was the first time Oti’s mother had seen her daughter dance live on the show.</p>
      <p>And what a show to turn up for! The Greatest Dancer judge and Emmerdale star brought the house down as they performed a jive to the Elvis Presley classic Jailhouse Rock, earning a near perfect score of 39 from the judges, including sister Motsi.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the dancer shared a heartfelt message to her dancing partner and the wonderful surprise he had arranged for her.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t even know where to start,’ Oti wrote. ‘Before we did our walk, [Kelvin] told me to over the corner.</p>

      <p>‘My mum has never ever seen me dance live on Strictly before and I just down in tears.’</p>
      <p>It turns out, Blackpool is very special place for the Mabuse family, as Oti continued: ‘The last time we were in Blackpool she was training me in the Blackpool championships.</p>

      <p>We’re not crying, you are!</p>
      <p>There were high-flying emotions all around tonight. It was a historic show for Strictly veteran Anton Du Beke, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/strictly-come-dancings-anton-du-beke-makes-history-as-he-scores-first-10s-with-emma-barton-11168688/">who managed to score his first 10s with partner Emma Barton after 17 series</a> of competition.</p>
      <p>Bruno Tonioli and head judge Shirley Ballas were more than happy to bestow this particular honour upon Anton, giving the pro and EastEnders actress a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>‘First ever 10s!’ Anton celebrated. ’17 series! You don’t understand!’</p>
      <p>Oh Anton…we think we do! What an emotional night!</p>
