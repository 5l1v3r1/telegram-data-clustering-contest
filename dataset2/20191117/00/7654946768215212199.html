      <h1>Barr accuses liberal ‘resistance’ of trying to ‘sabotage’ Trump</h1>

      <p>Attorney General William Barr called out Democrats forcefully in a fiery speech to the Federalist Society this week, accusing the party of trying to “sabotage” the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>“Immediately after President Trump won election, opponents inaugurated what they called ‘The Resistance,’ and they rallied around an explicit strategy of using every tool and maneuver available to sabotage the functioning of his administration,” Barr told the conservative audience.</p>
      <p>“The fact of the matter is that, in waging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war of ‘resistance’ against this administration, it is the Left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and the undermining of the rule of law,” he added.</p>
      <p>In his remarks to the judicial group, Barr said lefty resistance fighters had more in common with agitators under dictatorship than members of a liberal democracy.</p>
      <p>“Now, ‘Resistance’ is the language used to describe insurgency against rule imposed by an occupying military power. It obviously connotes that the government is not legitimate,” Barr said. “This is a very dangerous — indeed incendiary — notion to import into the politics of a democratic republic.“</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-19th-annual-barbara-k-olson-memorial-lecture">full transcript of Barr’s speech</a> was published by the Justice Department Friday. Also on hand for the ritzy event were was Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. His colleague, Justice Neil Gorsuch, spoke earlier at an event for the group at the The Mayflower Hotel. Both justices were appointed by Trump and have top Federalist Society bona fides.</p>
      <p>Though Barr, a former attorney general under George H. W. Bush, was initially viewed as a a moderate holdover, he has emerged as one of President Trump’s closest allies in Washington.</p>
      <p>Before the release of the Mueller report, Barr held a press briefing offering a summary of findings largely favorable to Trump, setting the tone of media coverage.</p>
      <p>In October, Barr <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/13/william-barr-appoints-us-attorney-to-examine-origins-of-russia-probe/">opened a criminal investigation</a> into the origins of the Russia probe. Connecticut State Attorney John Durham is conducting the review.</p>
