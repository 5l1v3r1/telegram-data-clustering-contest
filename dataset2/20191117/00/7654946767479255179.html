      <h1>Deval Patrick speaks at California candidate forum after announcing 2020 run</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:42:35+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Levine</a></address>
      <p>Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick addressed a candidate forum in California Saturday — his first major event as a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/former-massachusetts-gov-deval-patrick-enters-2020-race/">contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m not running to be president of the Democrats. I’m running to be president of the United States. There’s a difference,” he told thousands of assembled activists at the event sponsored by Univision, the local <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/16/california-democratic-convention-deval-patrick-rejects-moderate-agenda/4214402002/">Desert Sun reported.</a></p>
      <p>In his remarks, Patrick tried to avoid the divide between centrist Dems and the more progressive wing of the party.</p>
      <p>“I’m not talking about a moderate agenda. This is no time for a moderate agenda,” he said to applause, according to the paper. “I’m talking about being woke, but leaving room for the still waking. I’m talking about what it takes to rebuild a national community.”</p>
      <p>Patrick was joined at the event by other big-name presidential contenders like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Kamala Harris. Not on hand were Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former Vice President Joe Biden, who both skipped out on the confab.</p>
