      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite set new all-time intraday highs on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 is the first to become an “inflating parabolic bubble” on its weekly chart. This signal occurs when a stock or market has a 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading above 90 on a scale of 00 to 100. Eventually the S&amp;P will decline by 20% to 60% once the weekly chart turns negative.</p>
      <p>Sure, the S&amp;P 500 is above its quarterly and monthly pivots at 3,076.9 and 3,089.5, respectively, but the Dow is still below its quarterly risky level at 28.537 with the Nasdaq below its quarterly risky level at 8,591. This means that there remains some limited upside potential.</p>
      <p>Be aware that the Dow Jones Transportation Average and Russell 2000 slipped last week. Transports is below its annual pivot at 10,976 with the small cap index below its quarterly pivot at 1,599.40. These two are below their all-time highs by 6.4% and 8.4%, respectively.  </p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average set its all-time intraday high of 28,004.89 on November 15 with its quarterly risky level at 28,537.    </p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 set its all-time intraday high of 3,120.46 on November 15 and is above its quarterly and monthly pivots at 3,076.9 and 3,089.5, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq Composite set its all-time intraday high of 8,540.83 on November 15, below its quarterly risky level at 8,591.</p>
      <p>The Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Transports and Russell 2000 remain above their semiannual pivots at 27,266, 2,955.6, 7,999, 10.720 and 1,572.85, respectively.  </p>
      <p>The Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq remain above their annual pivots at 25,819, 2,867.1 and 7,370 Nasdaq, respectively. Transports and Russell 2000 remain straddle their annual pivots at 10,976 and 1,590.63.</p>
      <p>All five major averages have positive weekly charts, and the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq are now overbought with the S&amp;P 500 an inflating parabolic bubble.</p>

          <i>How to use my value levels and risky levels:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on December 31, 2018. The original annual level remains in play.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The close at the end of June 2019 established new monthly, quarterly and semiannual levels. The semiannual level for the second half of 2019 remains in play.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The quarterly level changes after the end of each quarter so the close on September 30 established the level for the fourth quarter. The close on October 31 established the monthly level for November as monthly levels change at the end of each month.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.</i>

          <i>How to use 12x3x3 Weekly Slow Stochastic Readings:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>My choice of using 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon back-testing many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading and I found that the slow reading worked the best.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. Recently I noted that stocks tend to peak and decline 10% to 20%.</i>
