      <p>Welterweight veteran Randy Brown gave fight fans their first finish earlier tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at UFC Fight Night 164 live on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573879514136chh">ESPN+</a> from inside Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when he stopped Brazilian bruiser Warlley Alves via second-round submission (triangle choke).</p>
      <p>After a back-and-forth first round that saw both fighters get their licks, Brown put forth his best effort in the second. He was able to find a home for a monstrous head kick along the cage followed by an upkick to the body which forced Alves to fall into Brown’s guard. At that point, “Rude Boy” was able to quickly secure a triangle choke and squeeze until the Brazilian tapped in front of the home crowd.</p>
      <p>Check out the full fight video highlights above courtesy of UFC/ESPN.</p>
      <p>With this performance, Brown secures his second-straight stoppage at 170 pounds after taking out the ultra-durable Bryan Barberena via TKO this past June. The 29-year-old contender has arguably never looked better — evident by this submission finish off his back— and may get what he’s asking for in the form of a Michael Chiesa fight.</p>
