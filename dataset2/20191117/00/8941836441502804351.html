      <p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) - Taylor Mikesell matched her career high with 23 points, and No. 8 Maryland cruised to a 99-55 victory over Delaware on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ashley Owusu and Blair Watson both had 12 points for the Terrapins (3-1), who didn’t need a comeback against the Blue Hens (0-3) in their first game since erasing a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter of Wednesday’s 70-68 victory at James Madison.</p>
      <p>Maryland never trailed and quickly achieved separation in the first quarter. Mikesell hit a 3-pointer and Watson added two more - all in a span of 53 seconds - to give the Terps a 20-4 lead and cap an 18-2 run. Delaware never cut the deficit to less than 11 the rest of the way and trailed 57-24 at halftime.</p>

      <p>The Blue Hens struggled with their ballhandling throughout the game, committing 25 turnovers, leading to 41 Maryland points. Tee Johnson led Delaware with 15 points.</p>
      <p>Maryland forward Shakira Austin made her first start of the season in place of Stephanie Jones, who had started 71 consecutive games before coming off the bench Sunday.</p>

      <p>Maryland improved to 13-0 against Delaware.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Delaware: Graduate student Nicole Enabosi, the 2018 Colonial Athletic Association player of the year, missed all of last season with an ACL tear and has yet to debut this season. The Blue Hens, picked to finish fourth in the CAA this season, figure to take a step forward when she returns.</p>
      <p>Maryland: The short-handed Terps have only nine healthy players, and each received at least 14 minutes against the Blue Hens. Coach Brenda Frese has managed her rotation well so far this season, with only Owusu averaging more than 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>POLL IMPLICATIONS</p>
        <p>Voters could modestly punish Maryland for its close call at James Madison, but the Terps are unlikely to move much in either direction after their 2-0 week.</p>
