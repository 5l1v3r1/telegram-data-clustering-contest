      <p>Gaming season is right around the corner. (As if it ever ends.) With long holiday breaks on the horizon, now is the perfect time to get some comfortable gear. Gaming headsets are always a pain point for me. They’re bulky, inelegant and most of the time leave my head a sweaty mess after I’ve been playing for an hour or so. Thankfully, there are a few options out there that don’t leave you with swamphead and also don’t break the bank. </p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2qW6TK4">Razer Nari Essential</a>

      <p>The Razer Nari Essential takes most of the guts of the Nari Ultimate, strips out the Chroma and haptic rumble, and gives you a world class, sub-$100, wireless gaming headset without the fancy extras. It still has THX Spatial Audio, which tracks sound in a 360-degree sphere around you with spooky accuracy, can switch to wired mode on the fly, and has leatherette covered and cooling-gel infused ear cups. You can wear them for hours in perfect comfort. There’s even hidden channels to accommodate glasses. Other than the haptics and lighting, the only other differences between the Essential and the Ultimate are that this headset has a boom mic and 40mm drivers instead of 50mm ones. Honestly, this is one case where it makes more sense to save the $100 and go with the less expensive model.</p>

      <p>With a ridiculously thick headband, cooling ear cups and a noise-reducing microphone, the new and improved Kraken takes everything that was amazing about the original model and makes it better. It comes in a wide variety of colors, and you can even get accessory kitty ears. The retractable mic helps keep your profile tight when you’re not using it, and the 7.1 surround sound audio will have you keyed in on every movement in game. For less than $80, it’s hard to make a case for anything other than one of the most popular gaming headsets on the planet. </p>

      <p>With an external sound card, 6mm detachable boom mic, and aluminum and leather accents, you’d be forgiven if you thought the Logitech Pro Gaming headset was a much costlier set of cans. With a downloadable equalizer (that works on Mac as well as PC, something Razer doesn’t do), you can tune your sound to exactly what you want. Big 50mm drivers will have you hearing every step, and the memory foam ear pads will have you tuned in all day. </p>

        <figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis 5<cite>SteelSeries</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Arctis 5 sports a best-in-class ClearCast bidirectional mic (that conveniently tucks into the main unit when not in use), DTS 2.0 sound, an in-line dial that lets you mix chat and audio volume on the fly, plus customizable RGB lighting effects and athletics-inspired material design—all for under $100. It’s no wonder then that it’s one of the most popular headsets on the market. It looks great, sounds great and doesn’t break your budget. The customization software is Mac and PC compatible, so you don’t have to take sides in the PC war just to fully use it. It’s compatible out of the box with the PS4, but has a 3.5mm adapter in the box for the XBox and Nintendo Switch (or any other device you’d like to plug it into). The Arctis 5 proves you don’t have to blow your budget to get the best. </p>
