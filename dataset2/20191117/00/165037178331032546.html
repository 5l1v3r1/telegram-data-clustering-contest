        <b>Bristol City forward Famara Diedhiou overshadowed Liverpool star Sadio Mane on Sunday by scoring a hat-trick as Senegal crushed eSwatini 4-1 in Africa Cup of Nations qualifying.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-mane-138826">Mane</a> <b>failed to score in successive Group I matches</b> spanning five days, but it did not matter as the Teranga Lions also <b>won comfortably against Congo</b> Brazzaville to top the table.</p>
      <p>Diedhiou missed a penalty before claiming his treble in<b> a rain-interrupted matchday two clash in Manzini,</b> where Badou Ndiaye was the other Senegalese scorer. The hat-trick hero played for six French clubs before moving to Bristol two years ago and <b>was the leading scorer for City last season </b>with 13 goals in all competitions.</p>
      <p>He equalised for Senegal in a drawn friendly with Brazil in Singapore last month, three years after scoring his only other international goal, against Namibia. <b>Fganelo Mamba netted for eSwatini</b>, formerly called Swaziland, when they trailed by three goals and <b>he was sent off three minutes later</b> after a second yellow card.</p>
      <p><b>Senegal have six points, C</b>ongo and Guinea-Bissau three each and pointless eSwatini appear out of the running for a top-two finish and qualification for the 2021 tournament in Cameroon. The Teranga Lions, whose stand-out players are Mane and Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly, <b>are seeking a first Cup of Nations title.</b></p>
      <p>They lost the 2019 final to Algeria four months ago and also had to settle for silver medals in a 2002 title decider won by Cameroon on penalties in Bamako. Meanwhile, <b>Nigeria were another leading team to score four times</b> in southern Africa, coming from behind to triumph 4-2 over Lesotho in Maseru with Victor Osimhen bagging a brace. <b>Masoabi Nkoto rattled the 2019 Cup of Nations bronze medallists</b> with a 13th-minute goal before Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chikwueze struck to give the visitors a 2-1 half-time advantage.</p>

      <h3>Maximum points</h3>
      <p>That lead stretched to three goals thanks to Osimhen before Chidozie Awaziem conceded a late own goal. Apart from Senegal, Nigeria are the only country to collect a maximum six points so far having also come from behind four days ago to edge Benin in Uyo. <b>Benin</b>, who stunned Morocco at the 2019 Cup of Nations before bowing out to Senegal in the quarter-finals,<b> lie second on three points thanks to a 1-0 win</b> over Sierra Leone in Porto-Novo.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere,<b> Cameroon got their first goal </b>and first win in three matches under new Portuguese coach Toni Conceicao to pip pointless Rwanda 1-0 in Kigali and top Group F. Nicholas Ngamaleu was the match-winner in central Africa, <b>netting after 71 minutes for the five-time African champions,</b> whose most recent title came two years ago.</p>
      <p>Conceicao was hired after the sacking of coach and former Dutch star Clarence Seedorf following the last-16 elimination of the defending champions from the 2019 tournament. Although guaranteed a 2021 finals place as hosts, <b>Cameroon are competing to gain competitive match practice</b>, leaving rivals Cape Verde, Mozambique and Rwanda to battle for one place.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, South Africa regained some pride after being well beaten in Ghana three days ago when they edged Sudan 1-0 in Soweto. Bafana Bafana squandered several first-half chances before France-based Lebogang Phiri broke the deadlock on the stroke of half-time. Slick passing created an opening and when a cross rebounded off the leg of a Sudanese defender, Phiri unleashed an unstoppable rising shot.</p>
      <p>After firing four goals in midweek when they hammered Group C outsiders Sao Tome e Principe,<b> Sudan struggled to penetrate the South African defence</b> and had only one attempt on target.</p>
