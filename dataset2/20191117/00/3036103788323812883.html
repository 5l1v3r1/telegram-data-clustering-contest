      <h1>SAA – There is nothing to rescue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>The strike at SAA will result in the downfall of the entire airline, according to acting chair Thandeka Mgoduso.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times reports that SAA is currently surviving on the goodwill of its lenders and could struggle to pay salaries at the end of the month due to a lack of income caused by the strike.</p>
      <p>SAA told Parliament that it would not be able to survive the strike and could face liquidation as a result.</p>
      <p>“If this strike perpetuates and there is no money coming into the company, everyone that we owe will want their money and where does the money come from?” Mgoduso said.</p>
      <p>There is no point in talking about business rescue, Mgoduso added, as SAA cannot be rescued.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing to rescue and that is why we are doing what we are doing to ensure that we return the company to a state where it can be turned around,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The employees that are on strike are the ones that are going to cause SAA to close.”</p>
      <p>Mgoduso said that the striking employees must “carry on their consciences” that they are responsible for the death of the state-owned airline.</p>
      <h3>Tough decisions</h3>
      <p>The South African government <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/government/327747-south-africa-set-to-make-tough-decisions-on-saa-gordhan.html"><b>recently stated</b></a> that it would take a tough approach to the troubles at SAA.</p>
      <p>“If some tough decisions need to be made, we’ll make them,” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said.</p>
      <p>The government will repay loss-making SAA’s outstanding government-guaranteed debt of R9.2 billion over the next three years, the National Treasury said in October.</p>
      <p>Lenders are demanding a firm repayment plan as a condition for agreeing to extend more funding, SAA has said.</p>
      <p>SAA has lost more than R28 billion over the last 13 years and relies on financial support from the government to remain solvent and operational.</p>
