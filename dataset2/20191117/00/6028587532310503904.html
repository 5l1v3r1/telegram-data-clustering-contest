      <p>An electric Hummer pickup and SUV could arrive by 2021. GM will build a Hummer pickup truck and SUV in late 2021, a <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2019/11/14/forecast-firm-says-gm-will-build-electric-sierra-escalade-detroit-hamtramck-plant/4196250002/">report from Detroit News</a> said this past week, citing Jeff Schuster, an industry analyst with LMC Automotive.</p>
      <p>This follows an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-labor-evs-exclusive/exclusive-electric-hummer-could-be-part-of-gms-move-into-ev-trucks-suvs-sources-idUSKBN1WX2HZ">October report from Reuters</a> about the “BT1 electric truck/SUV” program, part of a planned $3 billion investment in the Detroit-Hamtramck plant to make electric trucks and vans. The Reuters report also said GM could tap the Hummer brand.</p>
      <p>
        <b>This is not a Chevy Bolt or Cadillac or GMC pickup</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike Chevrolet’s plug-in hybrid Volt (now discontinued) and Bolt EV, Hummer is virtually a household for many Americans. And it carries more off-road cred and badassness than a brand like Cadillac or even GMC – both also likely EV candidates.</p>
      <p>In short, the Hummer brand could be a leg up* for GM, which has yet to see the massive market share gains made by the Tesla Model 3 or the darling of green car buyers a decade ago, the Toyota Prius.</p>
      <p>“Putting a Hummer badge on anything is a great idea for General Motors because half the marketing is already paid for,” Auto Forecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting Sam Fiorani told Reuters.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rivian and imminent Tesla pickups</b>
      </p>
      <p>GM will need all of the brand recognition it can get against the highly-anticipated Tesla pickup, set for announcement on November 21, and the Rivian R1T pickup and R1S SUV.</p>
      <p>The Rivian vehicles are already getting attention for their ambitious designs. Both will get a motor for each wheel to boost handling and off road excursions.</p>
      <p>Rivian is also claiming that the the 135-kWh model will get over 300 miles of range and the 180-kWh version over 400 miles. The R1S will have similar, though slightly better, range.</p>
      <p>Production is slated to begin in the U.S. next year for both vehicles.</p>
      <p>And Tesla? Needless to say, whatever Tesla announces on the 21st will get gobs of attention and likely land plenty of preorders.</p>
      <p>But a bold Hummer EV design could put a good fight out the gate, giving it a better chance than the Bolt ever had.</p>

      <p>NOTES:</p>
      <p>*GM’s marketing of the Volt (on the market from 2010 through early 2019) and Bolt EV has been pretty sad – one reason for limited recognition and middling sales. For example, the Bolt rarely appears in national TV campaigns, which almost often feature GM’s latest gas vehicles only.</p>
