        <b>The start of Alexis Sanchez's Inter career has been ruined by an ankle injury but the Chile star is progressing well in his recovery.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-sanchez-16967/">Alexis Sanchez</a>'s recovery from<b> ankle surgery</b> is on track and the Inter forward could<b> return ahead of schedule. </b></p>
      <p>Sanchez <b>suffered a dislocated ankle </b>and tendon damage while playing for <b>Chile against Colombia</b> in October.</p>
      <p>The need to have <b>an operation </b>meant <b>three months on the sidelines</b>, curtailing the early stages of his loan stay at <b>San Siro from Manchester United.</b></p>
      <p>Inter's head of medical services Piero Volpi told La Cuarta he is optimistic about <b>Sanchez's speed of recovery</b>, with the <b>30-year-old</b> aiming to resume work with a ball in the near future.</p>

      <p><b>"It is a delicate injury,</b> but the recovery is going very well, the deadlines are being met," he said.</p>
      <p>"Mid-January [is the return date] but we'll see.<b> Alexis could even come back a little earlier</b> if all goes well".</p>
      <p><b>"He has not yet done work with the ball</b>, but we hope that in the next few days we will have news about it. <b>Everything is going well."</b></p>
      <p>Sanchez scored on his only Serie A start for Inter, a<b> 3-1 win at Sampdoria</b> where he was later sent off, and has made four appearances overall for<b> Antonio Conte</b>'s side.</p>
      <p><b>Inter's first game of 2020 is away to Napoli</b> in the league on January 5, while they host Atalanta a week later.</p>
