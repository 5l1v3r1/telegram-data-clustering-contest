      <p>Today is the two-year anniversary of the release of DC’s <i>Justice League</i> film, and devoted fans still will not give up the idea that there is a better, unreleased version of the film out there. Deemed the “Snyder Cut,” the legend goes that there is a different version of the original <i>Justice League</i> movie out there, one originally crafted by director Zack Snyder before WB wanted to go for a “lighter” tone which included rewrites and substantive changes to the film. Snyder was also forced to leave the film after the tragic death of his daughter, and Joss Whedon took over to film parts of it in his stead.There’s more to it than that, as the history of the Snyder Cut is l<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versions_of_Justice_League">ong and complicated, </a>full of rumors and whispers, but fans have latched onto the idea that there is a much improved version of the film (which was released to a 27% Rotten Tomatoes score from critics) that is just waiting for some final touches and permission from WB to be unleashed. That has resulted in the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ReleaseTheSnyderCut&amp;src=trend_click&amp;pt=1196208952268197888">#ReleasetheSnyderCut</a> movement that has become something of a religion among DC fans, and here on the two year anniversary, it may be on the verge of bearing fruit at last.</p>
      <p>Not only is #ReleasetheSnyderCut trending with 400K tweets about it, but it now has been tweeted by <i>Justice League</i> cast members Ray Fisher (Cyborg), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) and Ben Affleck (Batman). Affleck and Gadot’s hashtag tweets have also been retweeted with supportive commentary by Snyder himself, which is causing fans to positively lose their minds as all this is unfolding in real time.</p>

      <p>One of two things is happening here:</p>
      <p>Either the stars and Snyder himself have gotten so sick of fans badgering them for two years about supporting the Snyder Cut movement that they finally decided to just throw all in and seemingly confirm that A) it exists and B) WB should finish and release it or…</p>
      <p>…this could be a coordinated marketing stunt by WB for a Snyder Cut release of the film they have been planning, whether one existed in full or not before this. If you’re at WB or DC it has been <i>impossible</i> to ignore the Snyder Cut movement in the last two years, and with Marvel stealing headlines and the spotlight with every new release, maybe WB figured it was time to step up and give fans what they want.</p>
      <p>WB is also on the verge of releasing streaming service HBO Max, and it’s hard to think of a better way to promote it among hardcore fans than to promise a Snyder Cut of <i>Justice League</i> exclusively on the service, or something like that. Or it could be a theatrical re-release, and bring in cash that way.</p>

      <p>As for what a Snyder Cut crafted years ago or more recently for some new release would look like is anyone’s guess. While I agree that <i>Justice League</i> felt a bit…disjointed with the sudden change in tone from Snyder’s past films, <i>Man of Steel</i> and <i>Batman V Superman</i>, it’s a little tough to believe there’s some absolutely diamond of a film in there if only a few more scenes were added and it was recut differently. But that’s the idea, and the goal is to elevate it from <i>Suicide Squad</i> DCEU quality to the much more lauded <i>Wonder Woman</i> instead.</p>
      <p>To me, this seems like a coordinated thing that WB has orchestrated, but again, it’s too early to tell and this is literally unfolding as we speak, with Affleck’s tweet being just half an hour ago at the time of this writing. I’m certainly looking for Henry Cavill or Jason Momoa to chime in next at this rate, but we’ll see.</p>
      <p>Wild times for DC fans. Stay tuned.</p>
