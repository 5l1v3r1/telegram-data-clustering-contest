      <p>KINGSTON, Jamaica - After two contrasting victories Clarendon College and Kingston College will now meet in the final of the ISSA Champions Cup final.</p>
      <p>Clarendon easily put aside Cornwall College with a clinical 3-0 drubbing while KC after a 1-1 fulltime score were able to get by Jamaica College 3-2 on penalties.</p>
      <p>Rodrick Granville scored twice for Clarendon College first in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute and then in the 68<sup>th</sup> minute. The third Clarendon goal came late in the encounter, the 88<sup>th</sup> minute, from the boots of Tahjay Williams.</p>
      <p>In the KC-JC match, KC took the lead through Demario McCarthy in the first half.</p>
      <p>Playing with the rain pouring down in the second half, both sides had to change from their starting kits mainly because of the prevailing soggy conditions. Yet despite the conditions, JC found a late equaliser courtesy of Shadane Lopez in the 83<sup>rd</sup> minute.</p>
      <p>The match then went to penalties, which KC won 3-2.</p>
