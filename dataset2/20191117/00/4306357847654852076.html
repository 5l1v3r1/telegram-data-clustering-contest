      <h2>John Barnes offers his thoughts on Frank Lampard's strong start to his reign in charge at Chelsea FC</h2>

      <h3>John Barnes has praised Frank Lampard for the impact he has had at Chelsea FC this season but has warned that there is still a long way to go.</h3>
      <p>The former England midfielder has been earning lots of praise for the job he’s been doing at Stamford Bridge after having been brought in to replace Maurizio Sarri at the club in the summer.</p>
      <p>Lampard has placed his faith firmly in youth this season and has been trusting the likes of Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount as regulars in his first team.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC have been in fine form in recent weeks and they have won their last six games in the Premier League to leave them third in the table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>England legend Barnes has been impressed by the impact Lampard has had at Stamford Bridge this season – but has warned that a dip in form is to be expected.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with <a href="https://www.thesportreview.com/2019/11/liverpool-fc-news-john-barnes-chelsea-fc-alexander-arnold-exclusive/">The Sport Review</a>, Barnes said: “I’ve been very impressed [with Lampard’s start at Chelsea FC], because of course with not being able to sign players and with young players coming in, you expect inconsistency.</p>
      <p>“The first game of the season [at Man United] they should never have lost 4-0, it wasn’t a 4-0 game.</p>
      <p>“They’ve done really well and been consistent. There may come a time when all of a sudden they drop a bit and we have to expect that, understand that and support that.</p>
      <p>“If they lose a few games or don’t perform for a few games, we can’t say that they’re not a good team or not good players, we have to understand that.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, things are going very well for them. But of course there is still a long way to go, so you can’t make a judgement – positively or negatively – when we haven’t even reached December yet.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action after the international break when they take on Manchester City away from home on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Blues finished third in the table and won the Europa League last season.</p>
