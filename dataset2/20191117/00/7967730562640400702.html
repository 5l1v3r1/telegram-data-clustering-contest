      <h1>They are happy for Behrouz but his 'brothers' remain in PNG, begging for freedom</h1>

      <p>Last Wednesday, refugees previously held on Manus Island, now in Port Moresby, said goodbye to their dear friend Behrouz Boochani. Together they lived through six years of trauma, abuse, illness and watched their brothers fade away at the hands of the Australian government.</p>

      <p>People I talk to say they feel a great happiness for their friend who is now free in New Zealand, and a deep sadness for themselves and each other, being left without a future or a home. Many are sick and living with enormous physical stress and mental struggle.</p>
      <p>One young man told me he asks himself: "What will be my future in PNG? Poverty or homelessness? How long do I have to be held here, with PNG immigration and contracted companies in control of my movements? When can I begin to live again? My life is disappearing.</p>
      <p>“Our minds are not working," he said. "Many of our friends are very depressed and mentally unwell."</p>
      <p>Since about 50 people arrived in Port Moresby, transferred from Manus Island a few months ago, they have expressed that they feel anxiety and fearfulness engulfing them.</p>

      <p>When they were on Manus, both Australian and PNG immigration were responsible for them; now they are being left alone in a new place that is not safe. All fear for their safety.</p>
      <p>Since the closure of Manus Island detention centre, the government has led Australians to believe that the "Manus problem" is solved. Hands dusted off. But people remain in offshore processing, far from being free and far from being safe.</p>
      <p>They cannot leave without travel documents that can only be issued by authorities, even though they have been found to be owed protection as refugees.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, 15 men had no choice when contractor Paladin and PNG immigration attempted to relocate them from the Granville Motel to housing within the Port Moresby residential community. But when they arrived their rooms had space for a bed and nothing else. There was one small kitchen to prepare meals but no laundry – and supposedly this was meant to accommodate all 40 of the men from Manus who have been found to be owed protection. Paladin ended up returning them to Granville because this housing clearly could not accommodate them.</p>
      <p>The Australian government has spent billions of dollars on such contracts to ensure the men remain offshore.</p>
      <p>Another 46 from Manus, whose status is unresolved, are incarcerated in PNG's Bomana prison.</p>
      <p>None of the Manus cohort can be left in PNG. For one, there is no medical capacity to treat people so mentally and physically unwell – people who have endured six years of indefinite detention without proper care.</p>
      <p>But the Australian government has not found any third-country resettlement option, yet it keeps refusing to accept New Zealand's genuine offer. New Zealand could be a home to all of them immediately. They could all fly there and be welcomed, as Behrouz was on Thursday night, without any negative consequence other than the chagrin of Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton.</p>

      <p>“It's very hard to be left behind," the young refugee told me, "still in detention while others are starting their new life in a safe country, or getting medical treatment that they have been desperately waiting for.”</p>
      <p>Port Moresby has been the place to which they have been moved, back and forth, since their days on Manus. Yet when they go now to medical appointments at the hospital, or are admitted, they are harassed and humiliated simply because they are refugees.</p>
      <p>One of the men said: “It makes me very distressed to watch a friend I have known for a long time who is severely sick being denied help and he gets worse everyday. We really feel helpless and hopeless when we think that Australian politicians do not care if we live or die – that they are trying to stop Australian doctors from treating us for sicknesses that cannot be or won’t be treated in PNG.”</p>
      <p>Some of the men have been evacuated to Australia for medical attention, with Dutton's approval, but it's another kind of torture to see the government attempt to repeal the medevac bill in the Parliament.</p>
      <p>If the government continues to refuse New Zealand's offer, Behrouz Boochani's brothers, as he calls them, will be left behind to waste.</p>
