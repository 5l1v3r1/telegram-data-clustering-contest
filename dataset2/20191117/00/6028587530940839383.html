      <p>Manny Pacquiao is hoping to climb back into the ring to defend his WBA Welterweight title in early 2020, but the date isn’t quite set. “I can fight in March, April because the Senate will be on break during that time,” said Pacquiao to the Manila Bulletin (h/t <a href="https://www.boxingscene.com/manny-pacquiao-looking-march-april-date-return--144325?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Boxing Scene</a>). President of MP Promotions Sean Gibbons says he expects Pacquiao to be in the ring during the first half of the first quarter of 2020. However, April 11 is a date that has gained some traction around the rumor mill.</p>
      <p>The uncertainty and layoff could work against Pacquiao.</p>
      <p>The Senator and future Hall-of-Famer will be 41 in less than a month. He fought twice in 2019. Pacquiao won a lopsided decision over Adrien Broner in January, and shocked the world with a victory over Keith Thurman to unify the WBA titles in July.</p>

      <p>It seems best he stay active as he continues to compete against top-level talents into his 40s. Going through a training camp after nearly a year out of the ring could present an issue for any fighter. It might be an even bigger problem for a 41-year-old who is also a Senator.</p>
      <p>The fighters mentioned as possible opponents for Pacquiao when he returns are IBF and WBC champion Errol Spence Jr., who is recovering from injuries suffered in an automobile accident. Yordenis Ugas, Shawn Porter, Mikey Garcia and Danny Garcia are the others rumored to be in the mix.</p>
      <p>As I’ve mentioned in the past, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/11/06/manny-pacquiaos-next-fight-why-danny-garcia-is-the-only-acceptable-garcia-for-pac-man-to-face/">Danny Garcia is the most sensible opponent for Pacquiao</a>, but one has to wonder if he’ll want to remain inactive while he waits for his shot at knocking off a legend.</p>
      <p>Garcia would be sitting an entire year if he doesn’t take a tune-up in between. Mikey Garcia’s last fight was a lopsided loss to Spence in March. Spence defeated Porter at the end of September and Ugas beat Omar Figueroa in July.</p>
      <p>No matter who’s chosen to stand opposite Pacquiao when he returns to the ring, we should all be aware of the potential rust and other ill effects that could come as a result of the legend’s long layoff.</p>
