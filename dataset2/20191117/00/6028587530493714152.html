      <h1>Forgot To Pack Something? Amazon Prime Delivers Ever Faster For Travelers In A Bind</h1>

      <p>Soon after Mike Gnitecki arrived in New York City, he realized that he had forgotten to pack sunscreen. Instead of wasting one minute of his vacation finding a nearby store, the firefighter and paramedic from Longview, Texas, placed an order on <a href="https://primenow.amazon.com/onboard">Amazon Prime Now</a>, a two-hour delivery service available in some 60 locations in the U.S.“I then went to the hotel's indoor pool,” he says. “And by the time I got back, the Amazon package was inside the entryway to my hotel room, presumably placed there by the hotel staff. I couldn't have been happier!”</p>
      <p>Roughly one in three Americans now subscribe to Amazon Prime, according to a <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/150f9af2201/a37a79a7-0eff-4a38-b05a-ce3c459addc2.pdf">study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)</a>, which estimated in early 2019 that there were over 101 million Prime subscribers. Most members shell out $12.99 per month or $119 per year for Prime’s free two-day shipping as well as unlimited streaming of movies, TV shows and music.</p>
      <p>Two-day shipping is great when you’re at home, but for travelers who have forgotten to pack a phone charger or umbrella, there’s tremendous appeal in Amazon Prime’s growing number of ever-faster, ever-more-flexible shipping solutions. Earlier this month, Prime ramped up delivery options just in time for the holidays, with over 10 million items available for free <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=15247183011">next-day delivery</a> in the U.S. and millions of items available for free <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=8729023011">same-day delivery</a> (on orders over $25) in 46 major metro areas.</p>
      <p>Planning a fun getaway to Vegas or Orlando? Or maybe a business trip to Tulsa or Raleigh? Amazon’s fastest service of all, the Prime Now two-hours-or-less service, launched in 2014 in Manhattan. Today it’s available in scores of locations from coast to coast, not only include all the major cities you’d expect but also in dozens of mid-size and smaller cities such as Savannah, Dayton, Ann Arbor and Naples.</p>
      <p>Ultrafast delivery means travelers don’t have to miss a beat. Beverly Friedmann, a New York City-based website content manager, once had Amazon Prime deliver a bathing suit to her hotel in Newport, Rhode Island, when she had forgotten to pack hers. “I was able to make the most of my trip rather than spend time shopping,” she says.</p>
      <p>And when Baltimore-based <a href="https://beyondbmore.com/">travel blogger Brian Oliver</a> found himself heading to Los Angeles for the 2018 NBA All Star Game, he bought a t-shirt online and had it shipped the same day so he could wear it at the game. “If I had ordered it from other retailers it would not have arrived in time,” he says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Groceries, toiletries and more.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being able order food and sundries online and have it delivered is also super handy if your hotel has a fridge or you’re staying in accommodations with a kitchen. Prime’s free grocery delivery from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market is available with one- or two-hour delivery windows.</p>
      <p>That’s a boon for travelers with dietary restrictions, like Io Dolka, managing director of a Seattle-based medical advocacy company. “I am preparing for a business trip and already placed the items I want to order in my cart,” she says. “My plan is to order from the plane so that my fresh items can be waiting for me at the hotel upon check in.”</p>
      <p>And every parent knows what a schlepfest it is to travel with babies or toddlers in tow. Want to lighten your load? “We always ship our diapers, wipes, formula, and swim diapers if we’re going somewhere warm,” says Christie Hudson, a mother of two, also from Seattle. “And one time I forgot my coat when traveling for business and ended up shipping myself a coat from Amazon Prime to my hotel. It’s seriously the best.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>No hotel address? No problem.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But what if you’re just passing through? Road-tripping Prime customers can order online and pick up at designated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=19181610011">Amazon Hub locations</a> in over 900 cities and towns across the United States. Options include two-day shipping to self-service Amazon Lockers or one-day shipping to Amazon Counters, which might be a retail location such as a Whole Foods Market, Stage, Goody’s, Rite Aid, GNC, Health Mart or 7-Eleven store. Some cities also offer Amazon Lockers+, which allow same-day delivery.</p>
      <p>“I use Amazon Prime to get pretty much all my necessities on the road,” says <a href="https://vacayvans.com/">van-life blogger Lisa Jacobs</a>, who has been traveling full time for the last year and a half. “I map out my upcoming path by Amazon Locker locations.”</p>
      <p>Finally, depending on the car you drive and the city you’re visiting, you may have yet another option: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?&amp;node=17735409011">Key by Amazon</a>, an app-based service which allows Prime members to get packages delivered inside their parked cars. This option requires some quick set-up on the Key by Amazon app, which must be linked to your vehicle’s connected-car service, such as OnStar, FordPass or AcuraLink. The app lets travelers track the delivery and remotely unlock and lock their cars when the delivery is made.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Easing the vacation re-entry blues.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And then there’s that last-mile problem for every traveler: Returning home to an empty fridge. Oliver always orders from Amazon Grocery as he’s returning from traveling. “It is a huge convenience to know that I can arrive home with my items waiting, allowing me to avoid a trip to the grocery store.”</p>
