      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Former Malaysian leader <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/najib-tun-razak/">Najib Razak</a>’s third corruption trial has started, with prosecutors saying <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/najib-tun-razak/">Najib</a> tampered with a government audit on the 1MDB state investment fund in a bid to avoid civil and criminal proceedings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/najib-tun-razak/">Najib</a> faces multiple corruption charges linked to the massive looting of the 1MDB fund, that contributed to his shocking election defeat last year.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram said Monday his team will show how <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/najib-tun-razak/">Najib</a> had abused his power to order the removal of material information from the auditor-general’s report on 1MDB in 2016 to cover up the truth.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/najib-tun-razak/">Najib</a> is being jointly tried with 1MDB ex-CEO Arul Kanda Kandasamy, who is accused of abetting him. Monday’s trial opened just days after another court ordered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/najib-tun-razak/">Najib</a> to enter his defense in his first corruption case.</p>
