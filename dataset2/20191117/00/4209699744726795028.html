      <p>Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says integrity and forthrightness are<br/>hallmarks of genuine Christians but he has refused to condemn the<br/>continued illegal detention of pro-democracy activist, Omoyele Sowore,<br/>by the Department of State Services.<br/><br/>He also failed to berate the DSS for refusing to obey court orders<br/>granting Sowore's release.<br/><br/>His principal, President Muhammadu Buhari with the sobriquet 'Mr.<br/>Integrity', has also turned deaf to local and international outcries<br/>calling for the release of Sowore and his co-prisoner of conscience,<br/>Olawale Bakare.<br/><br/>Osinbajo on Saturday at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG)<br/>Region 5, Great Minds Summit 2019, at the RCCG’s Chapel of Blessing,<br/>Port Harcourt, while delivering a keynote address, 'Exercising Kingdom<br/>Dominion', said, "Let me explain how Emperor Meiji in 1871, (within<br/>three years of the Meiji restoration) having observed the phenomenal<br/>progress of the West decided to send a mission to the UK and America<br/>to discover how they did it.<br/><br/>"The mission became known as the Iwakura mission. It was led by Prince<br/>Iwakura Tomomi; it was a team of statesmen, scholars, administrators,<br/>and students totaling 50 to the UK and America and find out why these<br/>people are great.<br/><br/>"Many left behind to study; they studied the principles that made<br/>these nations great and of course, the Japanese copy very well; they<br/>copied the principles, and later Chinese copied from Japan too.<br/><br/>"What were those principles? Righteousness, integrity, forthrightness;<br/>Proverbs:14:34-righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to<br/>any people.<br/><br/>"This principle applies to a man or woman; because a nation is first a<br/>person; Genesis 12:2, I will make you a great nation; first<br/>righteousness is the hallmark of the children of God.<br/><br/>"The second principle of the gospel which we need to practise is<br/>service and diligence; the principle of the gospel is that the<br/>greatest is the servant; the leader must be prepared to be the servant<br/>of all.<br/><br/>"Hard work/planning –the puritanical work ethic; this is the hallmark<br/>of the Christian; the puritans were so hard-working; so diligent that<br/>hard work was named after them.<br/><br/>"Time consciousness, Ecclesiastes 3:1–to everything there is a season;<br/>a time for every purpose under heaven, preparedness.; we must be<br/>conscious of time.<br/><br/>"All these principles made those countries great because the believers<br/>in those countries took their responsibilities seriously."<br/> </p>
