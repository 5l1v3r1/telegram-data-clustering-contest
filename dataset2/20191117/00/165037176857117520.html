      <p>The <b>21-year-old</b> attacking midfielder has <b>scored two goals</b> in six league appearances for Dinamo this season, but it was his performances in Spain's European Under-21 Championship triumph that<b> helped propel him into contention for a transfer</b> to La Liga.</p>
      <p>Olmo <b>netted three times </b>to help Spain's young players to glory and his form in big games has continue in the Champions League, with <b>four goals in nine appearances</b> for a Dinamo side still in contention to reach the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Asked whether his displays might carry him back to Spain, Olmo told Sport: <b>"I hope I can come back</b>, but we've just started the season really well".</p>

      <p><b>"We're doing well in the Champions League. </b>There are two games left and we depend on ourselves to get through. There's a lot of work to be done".Â </p>
      <p>"The Champions League is <b>a shop window for all young players</b>, especially if you're in a smaller league like Croatia."</p>
      <p>Olmo <b>did not make a senior appearance for Barcelona</b> before joining Dinamo as a 17-year-old, but he paid tribute to the training academy at La Masia for giving him strong foundations.</p>
      <p>On the speculation over a possible transfer back to Catalonia, Olmo said: <b>"We will see what happens".</b></p>
      <p>"I don't close the door on any club, but<b> I'm a Dinamo player</b>, what happens with Dinamo, we will see".</p>
      <p>"Barcelona's style: touch, movement - that's added to what I have learned in Croatia.</p>
