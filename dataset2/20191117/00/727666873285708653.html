      <h1>Yo Gotti Cuts Deal To Save $6 Million Fortune From Rapper Young Fletcher</h1>

      <p>Yo Gotti has saved a huge amount of money from a record label that claimed its artist was cheated out of a song from the rapper.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Memphis rapper Yo Gotti has managed to negotiate a settlement to hold onto a huge chunk of his vast fortune.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/yo-gotti-takes-the-stand-gets-terrible-verdict-as-6-6-million-judgment-upheld-2M63PxsI-E-GDbkrmHtC1A/">In June of 2019, a judge in South Carolina ordered Yo Gotti to pay $6.6 million to a record label called Stack Money Empire, over an artist named Young Fletcher.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Stack Money Empire won a default judgment against Yo Gotti after the company paid the rapper $20,000 to get an exclusive verse for Young Fletcher.</p>
      <p>Stack Money Empire said their dream of a feature with Yo Gotti crumbled because the rap star allegedly deliberately refused to sign paperwork to allow Young Fletcher to release the verse.</p>
      <p>The rapper also accused Yo Gotti of using the same lyrics for a different song, which wrecked his odds of success with his Yo Gotti collaboration.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/yo-gotti-could-lose-cars-mansion-to-another-rap-label-over-huge-6-6-judgment-kd7XzXmMh0m0hipD4sArMg/">Stack Money's CEO Michael Terry also said Yo Gotti tried to steal Young Fletcher from him by offering the rapper a $150,000 with CMG.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this week, both parties managed to settle the high stakes lawsuit.</p>
      <p>According to court records, Yo Gotti has already settled with Michael Terry. The two parties agreed to reach a financial settlement for an undisclosed amount.</p>
      <p>Young Fletcher even managed to get his song out of Yo Gotti according to his lawyer Clarke Dummit.</p>
      <p>“He’s excited about the settlement and he’s releasing a new song featuring Yo Gotti called ‘Truth Be Told,’” <a href="https://www.journalnow.com/news/local/lawsuit-alleging-yo-gotti-wiggled-out-of-a-deal-with/article_18d915cb-6756-5936-8637-0c02ea2a1685.html">Dummit told the Winston-Salem Journal. </a>“It is due to drop in the next 10 days.”</p>
