      <h1>Kerala: Event put off in view of Hindu marriage, village to mark Milad-un-Nabi today</h1>
      <h2>The Jama Masjid at Edivetti village, under Changaroth panchayat of Kozhikode, sits right across the house of Indira Nambiar, whose daughter Prathyusha, a post-graduate student, got married last Sunday.</h2>

      <p>Muslims of a village in Kerala’s Kozhikode district will celebrate Milad-un-Nabi, the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad, a week later, on Sunday, after having postponed the event on its original date, November 10, as a friendly gesture to accommodate and help smooth conduct of a Hindu wedding at a house opposite the local mosque.</p>
      <p>The Jama Masjid at Edivetti village, under Changaroth panchayat of Kozhikode, sits right across the house of Indira Nambiar, whose daughter Prathyusha, a post-graduate student, got married last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Mahallu committee (local committee) secretary N C Abdurahiman said, “The Hindu family had already fixed the wedding for November 10. They did not realise it was Milad-un-Nabi. Functions take place through the day during a marriage, and we would have also conducted many cultural events (on Milad-un-Nabi). We decided to postpone the functions at the mosque to avoid disturbing the marriage function.”</p>
      <p>Indira Nambiar said they did not imagine that the mosque would postpone its functions for her daughter’s wedding. “The mahallu committee told us that they were postponing their event to November 17 to help us. We did not make any such request. Many members of the masjid came to our house to bless my daughter that day,” she said.</p>
      <p>Abdurahiman said the masjid has 120 Muslim families under it and everyone in the mahallu agreed to the friendly gesture. “At a time when people are clashing over religion, we wanted to demonstrate our concern for the brethren in another community. We could have conducted the cultural evening last Sunday to mark Milad-un-Nabi, but that would have caused nuisance for the marriage…as the house is just in front of the mosque,” he said.</p>
