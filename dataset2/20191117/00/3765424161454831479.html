      <p>Zimbabwe’s month-on-month inflation rate quickened to 38,75% in October from 17,7% the previous month as analysts warned that Finance minister Mthuli Ncube’s 2020 budget will be rendered useless by soaring prices.<anchor name="more-210006720964068"/></p>
      <p>On Friday, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) said the inflation rate had hit a four month high in October, a day after Ncube said the monthly inflation rate would fall to single digits in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to Zimstat figures, a surge in the prices of food and alcoholic beverages was behind the resurgence in the inflation rate.</p>
      <p>Ncube unveiled a $63,6 billion budget for next year where he said the economy was expected to grow by 3% after a 6,5% contraction in 2019, but analysts and industrialists described the figures as too ambitious.</p>
      <p>“I think it has to be appreciated that this budget is coming against a background of a slowing economy,” Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce CEO Chris Mugaga said.</p>
      <p>“Projections of a fiscal deficit on the gross domestic product (GDP) of 1,5% are not realistic.</p>
      <p>“We also look at the issue of expenditure pattern. I don’t think we can have an expenditure of below $80 billion for 2020 given the inflationary trends we are having.</p>
      <p>“So generally if we look at the numbers, I think I will agree to say a supplementary budget will certainly be on the way.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I will be surprised with a supplementary budget of a minimum of about 30% of the $63,6 billion.”</p>
      <p>Ncube said the budget deficit in 2020 was projected at 1,5% of the GDP from 4% this year. He said economic growth would be driven by better agriculture output and improved electricity supplies.</p>
      <p>“Balancing books will be a tall order in 2020 and with the realities of inflation, they are way off the mark,” Mugaga added.</p>
      <p>“We can’t have inflation below three digits.”</p>
      <p>Former Finance minister Tendai Biti said Ncube’s projected revenues of $58,6 billion next year were “an illusion.”</p>
      <p>“A budget of $63 billion is an illusion and unachievable but also reflects the extent of hyperinflation,” Biti said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Without sorting currency issues, power shortages, corruption and productivity constraints, Zimbabwe is now in recession and decisive measures are required.”</p>
      <p>Mugaga said the cut in corporate tax to 24% from 25% was not likely to incentivise the private sector as the taxes remained too high amid the economic meltdown and power cuts.</p>
      <p>Ncube also announced that value added tax would be reduced to 14,5% from 15% next year.</p>
      <p>But Sekai Kuvarika, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries CEO, was upbeat, saying some of the incentives contained in the budget were steps in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“What is important for industry is an enabling environment,” she said.</p>
      <p>“When we have a stable currency, a stable macroeconomic environment and competitive business environment, we are able to generate that growth.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to comment on whether this is the right quantity of incentives, but what I can clearly say is that when you have your income tax reduced by 1%, it has been reduced.</p>
      <p>“So it’s a step in the right direction and I think it will be incremental.</p>
      <p>“Our expectation is that this direction will continue over the next few years.”</p>
      <p>Nigel Chanakira, a former banker and prominent businessman, said Zimbabwe’s economic recovery depended on improved international relations.</p>
      <p>Chanakira said the country’s biggest challenge was lack of foreign currency.</p>
      <p>“The exchange rate is running away and that triggers hyperinflation and the expectation becomes very bad.”</p>
      <p>Chanakira said Zimbabwe needed to sort out its politics first if it expected economic relief.</p>
      <p>A stalemate between President Emmerson Mnanagagwa and the opposition following a disputed election last year has cast a shadow of uncertainty over Zimbabwe, which is struggling to recover from almost two decades of economic stagnation. – The Standard</p>
