      <p>The Blackhawks improved to 5-1-1 in their last seven games. It was a markedly different performance than their first meeting with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nashville/">Nashville</a> this season, a dominant 3-0 win for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nashville-predators/">Predators</a> on Oct. 29 that Rinne called one of his easier shutouts.</p>
      <p>“We’re winning, it’s nice,” Lehner said. “It was a nice win, a nice bounce back. It kind of shows the progress we’ve made since the last time we were here.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nashville/">Nashville</a> got two goals from defenseman Roman Josi in its fourth consecutive loss. Rinne allowed four goals in 14 shots before he was replaced by Juuse Saros.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of things we didn’t do right, especially defensively,” Josi said. “We had our chances, but like I said, it wasn’t a good game at all.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nashville-predators/">Predators</a> have allowed 22 goals in their four-game slide.</p>
      <p>“You’re pressing in the first period and then you find yourself chasing the game,” coach Peter Laviolette said.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-kane/">Kane</a>’s third-period goal extended his goal-scoring streak to five games and his point streak to eight.</p>
        <p>The Blackhawks grabbed control with two in the first and second periods.</p>
        <p>“It was a good response tonight,” coach Jeremy Colliton said. “We knew coming into this rink it was going to be a test for us and we wanted to respond and show that wasn’t our team the last time we were here. I thought we did that.”</p>
        <p>Gustafsson beat Rinne with a wrist shot through traffic 6:33 into the first.</p>
        <p>“I was trying to get the puck to the net,” Gustafsson said. “Luckily, today there was two, three screens before it went into the net. It was good to see it go in there.”</p>
        <p>After <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nashville/">Nashville</a> defenseman Matt Irwin turned the puck over in the right corner, Kirby Dach found Kubalik all alone in front for his fifth goal with 1:56 left in the opening period.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> kept the pressure on in the second. Seabrook handcuffed Rinne with a backhand from the high slot at 1:51, and Kampf chased Rinne with a slap shot from the slot at 11:39 after a nifty passing sequence.</p>
        <p>It was the second time in just over a week that Rinne was yanked from the net. In <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nashville/">Nashville</a>’s Nov. 7 blowout loss at Colorado, Rinne was pulled in the second after allowing four goals on 23 shots.</p>
        <p>Josi ended Lehner’s shutout bid 3:40 into the third when he knocked in the rebound of a Matt Duchene shot.</p>
