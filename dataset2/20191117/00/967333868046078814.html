      <p>Recently, Corbyn promised to provide free full-fibre broadband for all by 2030, which the British PM Boris Johnson has <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911161077325773-BBC-Labour-broadband-communism/">slammed as a ''crazed, crazed Communist scheme''</a>.</p>
      <p>Corbyn's manifesto comes weeks before the looming 12 December snap general election in Britain, with the Labour Party predicted to come in second, according to the latest national polls.</p>
