      <h1>Teresa Giudice Dishes On What It Was Like To Reunite Her Children With Their Father</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:45:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:45</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from UsMagazine.com, Teresa Giudice sat down with the host of Andy Cohen on <i>Watch What Happens Live!</i> and explained what it was like to reunite her children with her husband, Joe Giudice, who was deported back to the country in which he was born, Italy.</p>
      <p>Reported by the outlet, who got their hands on a preview clip, Us claims it was a really “amazing trip” for her and her girls, and seeing her children with Joe again was a great joy.</p>
      <p>Near the beginning of the month, Teresa and her daughters with the recently-deported reality star, Joe Giudice, flew all the way to the European nation to see Joe. Teresa was there with their four children together, Audriana, Milania, Gabriella, as well as Gia, who are 10, 13, 15, and 18, respectively.</p>
      <p>As fans of <i>The Real Housewives New Jersey</i> know, the Giudice family hadn’t been together since the reality star served a 41-month prison sentence on a number of charges related to fraud. Following his arrest and imprisonment, Mr. Giudice spent seven months in the hands of ICE.</p>

      <p>Giudice wanted to wait until the verdict in his deportation case to be flown back to Italy on the 11th of October. Thankfully, for fans of the show, Bravo TV cameras were able to capture video of the family getting together again. And they also posted images on social media.</p>
      <p>A source who spoke with Us Magazine stated that the trip clearly put Teresa and Joe in a much better place in terms of their relationship. The insider stated that when the pair got together again, there was a reignition of old feelings.</p>
      <p>The insider claimed that Joe and Teresa, who got married twenty years ago, have spent a lot of time FaceTiming each other ever since Teresa came back from Italy. In an interview with the hosts from <i>Good Morning America,</i> which was broadcasted earlier this week on Thursday, Teresa rhetorically asked what it would be like to have a relationship with a person living in another country.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the reality star explained that despite their differences, including the vast distance between them, she will always have that special spot in her heart for her husband. The fate of their marriage is currently undetermined.</p>
