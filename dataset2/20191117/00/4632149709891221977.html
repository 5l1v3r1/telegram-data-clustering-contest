      <p><i>By Poojitha Girish<br/><br/><br/>No infrastructure, no votes, was the message they had for politicians<br/></i><br/>Residents of Haralur and neighbouring areas took to the street to protest against civic apathy on Saturday. The protest march began from Parappana Agrahara Main and culminated at Sarjapur Road. <br/><br/>During the protest, the residents held placards and raised slogans like ”No Roads, No Votes” and “Yedheli Yedheli” (wake up), sending out a clear message to politicians. “The roads are damaged with potholes and footpaths are crowded with parked vehicles. There have been numerous accidents and yet no traffic management,” said a protester. “The Harlur lake is not well maintained. There is an unbearable odour and so many mosquitoes, that children cannot risk stepping out to play or cycle,” said Latha Mahadevan, resident of Harlur.</p>

      <p>The residents have been complaining for a long time now and received no response from the respective authorities, and so they came out in protest. “We see these officials during elections and then they vanish. <br/><br/><br/>The promised electricity and road repairs were started during the election and was left incomplete. These dug up areas are now more dangerous. Corporators are out of reach now and this protest was a must to wake them up” Mahadevan added. Residents demanded more transparency in contact details of where they can register their complaints.</p>
