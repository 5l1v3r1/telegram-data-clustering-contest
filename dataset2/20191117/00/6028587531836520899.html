      <h1>Video Suggests Russia’s Poseidon Nuclear-Powered Drone Has A Seabed-Launched Version</h1>

      <p>Sometimes valuable military intelligence is hiding in plain sight. An innocuous Russian media report shared to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBmpvLkRx4E">YouTube in June</a> had just 380 views a few days ago. It reports that Russia’s latest “oceanographic research vessel,” <i>Akademic Aleksandrov</i>, was completing sea trials. The video was taken in Severodvinsk near the Arctic where many of Russia’s most advanced submarine programs are based. What very few of the viewers may have realized is that the object on the deck appears to be one of Russia’s latest strategic weapons: the Poseidon mega-torpedo. That’s valuable intelligence in itself – the ship has not been formally associated with the project before. But does it hint at something more – a seabed-launched version of the weapon that would be harder to counter?</p>
      <p>Until now most of the information available has referenced a submarine-launched version. That will be carried by the <i>Belgorod</i>, a massive special mission submarine launched in the same port in April. But a seabed version, possibly called ‘<i>Skif</i>,’ was also rumored in 2013. That rumor went quiet but it hasn’t been forgotten. One eagle-eyed watcher noticed the object in the video and started the Twitter ball rolling:</p>
      <p>Poseidon is one of the most disruptive weapons currently being developed. It is also one of the least well understood. Each new report and image provides intelligence that improves our understanding. It is designed to hit coastal cities with a 2 megaton warhead, around 133 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.</p>
      <p>It is often described as a drone or autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and as an Intercontinental Nuclear-Powered Nuclear-Armed Autonomous Torpedo in some U.S. government documents. I prefer the torpedo likeness since it is a weapon, intended for a one-way journey. It is massive though, around 20-30 times the size of regular torpedoes. We know that with a nuclear power plant it will presumably have virtually unlimited range, be able to dive deeper than most current weapons and run so fast that current torpedoes wouldn’t catch it. So it would be very hard to counter. But the launch submarines are possible weakness because they might be trailed and neutralized before the torpedo can be fired. This raises the question of a seabed-launched version.</p>
      <p><i>Akademic Aleksandrov</i> <a href="https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2017/05/another-special-purpose-ship-russian-navy">was launched in 2017</a>. It is described as a multi-purpose vessel with a reinforced ice-breaking bow. Apparently it is designed for research and scientific work on the Arctic shelf and for rescue operations. A closer look at the video however suggests that it’s actually part of a wider program to field the Poseidon weapon.</p>
      <p>The back, called the transom, has a cut-out for a cradle which neatly fits the Poseidon launch tube. This cradle can be extended over the back to pick up the weapon, something which is confirmed in commercial satellite imagery. And the large yellow crane seen in the video is reportedly able to carry 100 tons, which just happens to be my estimate of Poseidon's weight.</p>
      <p>Russia already has the ice-capable ship <i>Asterisk</i> for recovering Poseidon test rounds. And a purpose-built test submarine to launch it called the <i>Sarov</i>. So a natural question is why would Russia build yet another ship with special accommodations for this unique weapon? One possibility may be that the weapon has grown during development and <i>Asterisk</i> can no longer support the full range of tests. But there appears to be more to it.</p>
      <p>One indication is that in front of the lifting gear on the aft deck of <i>Akademic Aleksandrov</i> there appears to be a covered hangar. This is large enough for Poseidon. Possibly several. This appears unnecessary if the ship is only intended to recover test rounds. It implies maintenance and longer term carriage. Thus it rekindles suspicions of a seabed-launched system which would require specialist ships to deploy and maintain.</p>
      <p>Future evidence may confirm or disprove this theory. But there appears to be much more to this ship than at first meets the eye.</p>
