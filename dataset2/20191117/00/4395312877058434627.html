      <h2>Mental well-being starts with taking care of your body.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/karim-hassan/" target="_blank">Karim Khashaba</a></address>
      <p>It all starts with your body.</p>
      <p>While getting busy with your daily life routine, trying to balance between your spiritual well being, keeping up with your physical fitness &amp; maintaining a healthy social life, keeping everything in balance is the hardest effort you can make for a healthy lifestyle routine. But unfortunately in this era we live in we always get caught up in everyday duties and we always end up forgetting about what matters the most which affects every corner of your life, it’s working out, getting all those toxins out of our body and maintaining a healthy diet which can let your body make the change for a better body image, happier self and of course a stronger mental consciousness.</p>
      <p>The biggest and hardest obstacle we all cannot avoid is not finding enough time for our daily physical routine, taking a lot of time to and back from the gym, don’t know what fitness routine should i be working on, and of course getting lost in all those online diet food options, </p>
      <p>That’s why having a personal trainer at <a href="https://getgoingpt.com.au/">Getgoing</a> was a very appealing idea to me, coming till my home doorsteps, Forgetting the commuting time to my favourite gym, it also reflected on my overall well being and mental health.</p>
      <p>A lot of people like training one to one with the coach but what i am personally recommending is to have a partner in your workout sessions, a partner will act as your perfect ongoing motivation, you will share a goal together, anytime you will feel down or unmotivated you will find your partner pulling you off the ground and pushing you towards the finish line.</p>
      <p>Training with your partner for sure will strengthen your bond, magnify the goal and will boost your motivation, and the good thing it shouldn’t be only viable to your girlfriend, you can bond with a family member or close friend then you should brace yourself for the mind blowing results and energy.</p>
      <p>Having a well balanced attention between working out and what you are eating will reflect on every aspect of your life and what is most important is your mental capabilities will be boosted to the max whether it’s more focusing on your work tasks or even remembering the name of your acquaintance you met last week.</p>
      <p>Setting up a goal to be constantly working for will improve the hard working mechanism in your brain, you will start seeing some improvements on your overall body which will translate to your brain and self that anything you start investing time and effort in it will surely blossom into something you will love. </p>
      <p>With all these infinite benefits you will gain from improving your physical health, these are the top 5 traits that will affect your mental health:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Better mood</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In case you want to feel happy and relaxed, you need to exercise different types of physical activity, whether it’s going to the gym or even brisk walking.</p>
      <p>Physical activity stimulates the chemicals in your brain, which makes you feel happy and relaxed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Longer time focusing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regular physical activity helps maintain key mental skills, especially with age, and this includes critical thinking and learning.</p>
      <p>Engaging in various sports 3 to 5 times a week, for at least 30 minutes, can provide health benefits for the mind.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Less exhaustion and depression</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you are physically active, your mind is free from daily stress. This can help you avoid negative thoughts.</p>
      <p>Exercise reduces the level of stress hormones in the body, and at the same time stimulates the production of a substance called endorphins, a chemical released from the brain when exercising.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved sleeping patterns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sports and other forms of physical activity improves sleep quality by helping you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep.</p>
      <p>Better sleep can improve your mental expectations the next day as well as improve your mood.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boosted self confidence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regular exercise can enhance self-esteem, your ability to withstand excessive stress, and contribute to an improved outward appearance.</p>
      <p>With renewable strength and energy that comes from physical activity, you may be more likely to succeed in off-field tasks.</p>
