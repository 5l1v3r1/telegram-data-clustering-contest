      <p>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - California linebacker <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evan-tattersall/">Evan Tattersall</a> was taken off the field on a stretcher and taken to the hospital after being hit in the head on kickoff coverage.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evan-tattersall/">Tattersall</a> was running down on coverage Saturday night when Southern California linebacker Juliano Falaniko appeared to lower his helmet and hit <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evan-tattersall/">Tattersall</a>. Falaniko immediately signaled for trainers to come on the field before the play was even over as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evan-tattersall/">Tattersall</a> was down on the field.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evan-tattersall/">Tattersall</a> remained down for several minutes as players and coaches from both teams kneeled out of concern. He was strapped to a board and gave a thumbs up before being taken off on a cart. Cal said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evan-tattersall/">Tattersall</a> is alert and has movement in his extremities. He was taken to the hospital out of precaution.</p>
