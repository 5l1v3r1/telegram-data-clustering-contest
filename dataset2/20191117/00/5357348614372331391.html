        <b>A prominent Montego Bay businessman was recently questioned for over two hours by the Counter-Terrorism and Organised Crime Investigation (CTOC) Branch of the Jamaica Constabulary Force.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The businessman, a player in the travel and tour industry, was quizzed by the cops about activities carried out on behalf of his company while it was in liquidation.</p>
      <p>The company was placed in liquidation twice by the Supreme Court. The contention, however, is that its principals conducted certain transactions, which included the filing of a lawsuit against another prominent Jamaican company, while the entity was in liquidation, which is believed to have contravened Jamaican law.</p>
      <p>The businessman sat through the interview with his two Kingston-based lawyers.</p>
      <p>Allegations are that company executives acted without the permission of the court or the liquidator of the company.</p>
      <p>Under Jamaican law, companies in liquidation can only act through a liquidator or by a directive of the court. Anything else could amount to an offence.</p>
      <p>A senior police source said that the possibility of a further interview existed, adding that the businessman's lawyers would be contacted soon to outline the decisions that have been made in respect to the findings from the interview, and a determination made regarding whether or not charges will be laid against him.</p>
      <p>“The CTOC investigators are going through the information and soon, certain decisions will be made,” the senior police source said. “Investigations are continuing and there are some documents outstanding from a Government agency that will assist in the investigations.”</p>
      <p>CTOC was formed out of a merger of the Organised Crime Investigation Division, and the Flying Squad.</p>
