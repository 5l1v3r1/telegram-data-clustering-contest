      <h1>Tahira Kashyap: Was insecure earlier about Ayushmann's make-out scenes</h1>

      <p>Mumbai, Author, filmmaker and cancer survivor Tahira Kashyap says she used to feel insecure while watching make-out scenes of her husband, actor Ayushmann Khurrana, in films, but she has learnt to overcome that feeling. <br/><br/>Tahira confessed that she got insecure when she saw an intimate scene between Ayushmann and Yami Gautam in "Vicky Donor". <br/><br/>"Yeah, I was insecure earlier but when I was watching the edits of 'Andhadhun', I told the team that something is missing in the make out scene between Ayushmann and Radhika Apte. That moment I realised about the transformation, from being an insecure wife to analysing the make out scenes," Tahira said. <br/><br/>Talking about her own identity, she said: "I know Ayushmann for 18 years and I take pride in being called as Ayushmann's wife. As far as my identity is concerned, the world has been really receptive towards the message I have of self-acceptance. People have started to accept me for who I am and my presence, opinion and existence." <br/><br/>She says Ayushmann is "an introvert and likes to keep calm around 10 people. He doesn't like to talk much as he is a good listener". <br/><br/>After her battle with cancer, Tahira said she has become a "lot crazier in the 2.0 version of myself. There is a lot of self-acceptance and I feel beautiful inside out. I have become stronger". <br/><br/>"Cancer is something which people should accept openly and an experience like this helps you look at life through a different prism," she added. <br/><br/>Recalling her children's reaction through the process, she said: "At first, Virajveer was devastated and crushed while on the other hand Varushka was intrigued with the process and the look". <br/><br/>Asked if it was easy to sport a bald look, Tahira said: "It was difficult for my kids to accept my new look because people have created a stereotype of beauty." <br/><br/>Tahira opened up about various aspects of her life when she appeared in an episode of "The Love, Laugh, Live Show", which is aired on Romedy Now. <br/><br/>--IANS <br/><br/>sug/vnc</p>
