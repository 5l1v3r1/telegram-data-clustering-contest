      <p>Activists of some Dalit outfits, social organisations and the Bahujan Samaj Party sat on a protest in Sangrur district of Punjab on Sunday, a day after a 37-year-old Dalit man died after being mercilessly thrashed and forced to drink urine earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The protesters, who blocked the Lehra-Sunam road, demanded that the next of kin of the deceased be given a government job and his family be provided a compensation of Rs 50 lakh.</p>
      <p>"The family should be given justice. The perpetrators of the crime should be hanged. The Punjab government should give a job to the victim's wife and Rs 50 lakh compensation should be given to the family," a protester said.</p>
      <p>The Aam Aadmi Party's Sunam MLA Aman Arora, who also visited the protest site, said the family should get justice and their demands should be met by the government.</p>
      <p>Four people have already been arrested in connection with the crime.</p>
      <p>The victim's kin have refused to allow post mortem and to take the body until a government job is given to his widow and the family gets Rs 50 lakh compensation. The family also demanded that those responsible for the crime be given exemplary punishment.</p>
      <p>The dalit man is survived by his wife and three children, including two daughters.</p>
      <p>His widow told reporters that they have not been approached by any government agency yet.</p>
      <p>"Our demand is that exemplary punishment should be given to the accused. The government should give us written assurance that they will give me a job and a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the family," the victim's wife said.</p>
      <p>Expressing grief over the death, Punjab Minister and Sangrur MLA Vijay Inder Singla said, "Whatever has happened is unfortunate. We stand with the family. The accused should get exemplary punishment."</p>
      <p>Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly and AAP legislator Harpal Singh Cheema said the family should be given adequate compensation 'and they should get police security'.</p>
      <p>AAP's Sangrur MP, Bhagwant Mann said that in a civilised society such incidents were shameful and demanded those responsible for the crime be given strict punishment.</p>
      <p>On October 21, the victim, who was a resident of Changaliwala village, got into an altercation with one Rinku and some other persons over some issue.</p>
      <p>The matter was resolved with the intervention of villagers, the police said.</p>
      <p>The victim had told police that on November 7, Rinku had called him to his house where the two talked about the issue.</p>
      <p>He had alleged that he was then thrashed by four persons with a stick and an iron rod after being tied to a pillar and was forced to drink urine when he asked for water.</p>
      <p>After the incident, the opposition parties have attacked the Congress government over the "barbaric treatment" being meted out to Dalits in the state.</p>
      <p>The Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party said a 'rule of jungle' was prevalent in the state.</p>
      <p>State Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said strict punishment would be given to those involved in this incident while the Punjab State Scheduled Castes Commission has also sought a report from the Sangrur SP over the incident.</p>
      <p>The commission's chairperson, Tejinder Kaur, had on Friday said the rights body had learnt about the incident through media reports and it had taken suo motu cognisance of the matter.</p>
