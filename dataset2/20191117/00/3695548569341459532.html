        <b>Toro Rosso Formula 1 driver Pierre Gasly says his Brazilian Grand Prix podium was "insane", "really emotional" and "just the best day of my life".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old racer, who is contesting his second full campaign in grand prix racing, was unable to score a podium in his 12 races with Red Bull's main team this year, and was replaced by Alex Albon after the summer break.</p>
      <p>But a race of high attrition among the top cars in Brazil gave Gasly a shot at a milestone result in Toro Rosso machinery, and when Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton clashed with Albon on the penultimate lap, Gasly moved past both and into second place.</p>
      <p>Gasly could be heard screaming in elation on team radio after the chequered flag, and admitted afterwards that he had been completely blindsided by the opportunity to score a top-three finish.</p>
      <p>"It's just the best day of my life," he said. "As a kid, you dream about being in Formula 1. And then when it happens, it becomes the best day of your life. And then after you dream about your first podium...</p>
      <p>"To be fair, I didn't think this will happen [after] coming back with Toro Rosso during the second part of the season, but I just kept working on myself, tried to push the team as much as I could, telling them 'OK, we need to make the best out of all the opportunities we have until the end of the year'. And today it just came to us."</p>
      <p>The result was Toro Rosso's second podium of 2019 after Daniil Kvyat's third place in the mixed weather conditions of the German GP.</p>
      <p>Combined with Kvyat's 10th place, it vaulted Toro Rosso past Racing Point into sixth in the constructors' championship and to within eight points of Renault ahead.</p>
      <p>Gasly was top of the midfield cars in qualifying, and comfortably headed F1's 'second tier' throughout the race as he looked poised for a seventh-place finish.</p>
      <p>But as Valtteri Bottas' Mercedes expired and the two Ferrari drivers clashed, he thought back to his breakthrough fourth-place result in Bahrain last year.</p>
      <p>"I felt good in the car the whole weekend and I think we managed to get the car exactly where I wanted," he said. "I said 'OK, if we finish best of the rest again in the race this will be amazing for us'.</p>

      <p>"So that's what we were doing. The whole race we had a good pace. I was controlling the gap with the guys behind but we always had quite a safe margin.</p>
      <p>"I could push quite nice and even at the beginning of the race, I could see Albon and Charles [Leclerc] wasn't pulling away so much. So I think the car was working really well.</p>
      <p>"When they [the top teams] started to battle, first the Ferraris, I was like 'OK, this looks quite similar to Bahrain 2018 in P4'. And then after I knew Lewis will try something [on Albon]."</p>
      <p>Gasly said he got used to the feeling of standing on the podium throughout a successful junior single-seater career, but had come to "really miss" it since joining the F1 grid.</p>
      <p>"it's something you want to experience and especially in Formula 1. And to be in second place between Max [Verstappen] and Lewis [Hamilton, who was later penalised], my first podium in F1 is just insane, amazing and really emotional for me."</p>
