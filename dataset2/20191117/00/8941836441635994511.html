      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M;: For a second straight game, the Aggies were tested, but this time it was for a full four quarters. Texas A&amp;M; held a 34-18 advantage in points in the paint, but had difficulty finding scoring from anyone other than Carter and Wells as the rest of the team shot 6 of 22 from the field.</p>
      <p>Rice: The Owls, which received votes in the latest rankings, outscored the Aggies, 24-13, in the third but couldn’t keep that momentum into the fourth as they scored eight points on 3 of 15 shooting. Rice, the preseason favorite to repeat as Conference USA champions, has not beat a Top 25 team since Dec. 1, 2006, when they defeated Texas A&amp;M.;</p>
