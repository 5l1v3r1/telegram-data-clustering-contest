      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Georgia’s defense entered the fourth quarter vying for another shutout. The fifth-ranked Bulldogs ended it with two big stops - and another division title.</p>
      <p>In between, things got interesting.</p>
      <p>Jake Fromm passed for three touchdowns and Georgia’s defense delivered in the clutch, clinching the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division with a 21-14 victory over No. 13 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> on Saturday.</p>

      <p>“Our kids were very resilient to come into this place and lose momentum - obviously lose momentum - and be able to go back out and get it,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “I thought that showed some fortitude and ability to handle some tough, adverse things.”</p>
      <p>The Bulldogs (9-1, 6-1 SEC, No. 4 CFP) sailed through three quarters with a 21-0 lead before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> (7-3, 4-3) rallied in the fourth.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Georgia held on to become the first team to win three consecutive SEC East titles since Florida won five in a row from 1992-96.</p>
      <p>“It’s special and speaks a lot about this football program, our head coach and about our team in the locker room,” Fromm said. “Guys who are willing to come in and do whatever it takes.”</p>
      <p>Fromm and De’Andre Swift produced enough to keep the Bulldogs on track for a shot at the College Football Playoffs. Most of the way, though, it was clear the game featured two of the league’s top defenses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> scored two touchdowns in the fourth, then had a pair of drives stopped on fourth down in the final minutes. Freshman Bo Nix threw three incompletions and was sacked on the Tigers’ final drive starting from their 27.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Fromm was 13-of-28 passing for just 110 yards, but had a 51-yard touchdown pass to Dominick Blaylock and a pair of 5-yarders to Eli Wolf and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-herrien/">Brian Herrien</a>. Swift ran for 106 yards on 17 carries.</p>
        <p>Nix completed 30 of 50 passes for 245 yards and a touchdown. He also ran 13 times for 42 yards. Seth Williams caught 13 passes for 121 yards.</p>
        <p>The Tigers finally scored on Nix’s 3-yard touchdown pass to Eli Stove with 10:04 left, taking advantage of a pass interference call on the previous third-down play. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> appeared to recover an onside kick but it was overturned upon review because of an illegal block by Anthony Schwartz.</p>
        <p>A Georgia three-and-out and three minutes later, Nix dove into the end zone for a 2-yard score after a play fake.</p>
        <p>It was the first rushing touchdown the Bulldogs had allowed all season.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> again drove into Georgia territory with Nix running for 8 yards on a fourth-and-5 play. Harold Joiner couldn’t collect a pass that was slightly behind him on the next fourth-down play.</p>
        <p>“It was a sprint out and I threw it behind Harold,” Nix said. “You can’t make mistakes like that.”</p>
        <p>Smart didn’t give his defense too much credit for that one.</p>
        <p>“The guy just missed the ball, it looked like to me,” the Bulldogs coach said. “He was wide open. I can’t say that we stopped them. We got them to fourth down and they gave us a gift.”</p>
        <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
        <p>Georgia: Has won 15 of the last 19 meetings. Was outgained by 329-251 in total yards.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a>: Continued to struggle offensively against top teams. But the defense remains good enough to keep the Tigers in most games. Fell to 1-3 in games against teams currently ranked in the Top 11, all of them competitive.</p>
        <p>STALLED DRIVES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> did have a handful of promising drives before the fourth but struggled to cash in with points. In the first half, the Tigers had a missed field goal, a 13-yard loss on fourth down and a fumble by Nix. With the game still in reach, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> had the ball in Georgia territory on its first two possessions of the second half but came up empty.</p>
        <p>CLOSE CALL</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a>’s Williams had a catch overturned by replay officials on the penultimate drive. He appeared to get his right foot down but the ball was wobbling as Williams went out of bounds.</p>
        <p>“We had the momentum and the crowd was in it,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/auburn/">Auburn</a> coach Gus Malzahn said. “We got the ball down to the 22-yard line and we thought we had a completion. They overturned it and it looked like an NFL catch to me. That was a tough one, a real tough one.”</p>
        <p>PHOTOGRAPHER HURT</p>
        <p>A photographer was taken to the hospital after she was hit on the sideline and carted off the field. A Georgia statement said Chamberlain Smith was sent to East Alabama Medical Center in nearby Opelika for treatment. The school didn’t specify her injury.</p>
        <p>A photography intern for the University of Georgia Athletic Association, the Georgia graduate was hurt when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-herrien/">Herrien</a> ran into her several feet off the sideline late in the second quarter. Smith was kneeling down to take a picture and appeared to get hit in the head by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brian-herrien/">Herrien</a>’s knee.</p>
        <p>Smith drew immediate medical attention and was down on the ground for several minutes. She had her eyes open, along with a bruise above her eye, when she was taken off on a stretcher.</p>
