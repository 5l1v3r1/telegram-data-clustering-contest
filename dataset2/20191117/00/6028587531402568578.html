      <p>As a Midwesterner with New England roots, my Thanksgiving dinners have been solidly traditional, with the mainstays being turkey and pie. But, during the two years I lived in Arizona, I was delighted to discover that tamales were on the menu for many Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts.</p>
      <p>Friends told me that tamales are often served across the South, in Texas and other parts of the Southwest as part of holiday meals.</p>
      <p>They’re especially important to Latino families, but I found that diners from all kinds of backgrounds were eager to serve them.</p>
      <p>Since making traditional tamales <a href="https://www.foodrepublic.com/recipes/best-basic-tamales-recipe/">can be time consuming</a>, most people that I met admitted to ordering them in advance from a favorite spot, and then picking them up on the eve of the holiday.</p>
      <p>So, last week, an email from Del Taco immediately got my attention. “Tamales: a delicious holiday tradition, coming Nov. 21,” it declared.</p>
      <p>I wondered whether this was a notification for Arizona customers that mistakenly landed in my Michigan email box (I first signed up for Del Taco’s emails when I was living there).</p>
      <p>I knew that Del Taco offers regional menus. The one for Michigan, for instance, differs from what Del Taco offers in various Southern states as well as San Diego.</p>
      <p>No, Del Taco spokesman Josh Levitt told me, it’s a national promotion, starting Thursday, and marks the first time Del Taco has offered tamales.</p>
      <p>He said the fast food chain expects to sell more than 1 million tamales during the holiday season. Del Taco has about 600 outlets, half company owned and half franchises, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/deltacofreshmexicangrill/282277">according to Entrepreneur.</a></p>
      <p>Del Taco’s tamales are made in the traditional way, with seasoned shredded pork and stone ground masa (corn), hand wrapped in a corn husk, Levitt said.</p>
      <p>The tamales are available plain, or dressed up two ways: topped with a combination of zesty red sauce, tangy green sauce, sour cream and cilantro, or topped with chili, hand-grated cheddar cheese, and sour cream.</p>
      <p>Individual tamales cost $2.19 each, or four for $7.59.</p>
      <p>The chain also is offering a two for $4 offer, while the smothered tamales are offered two on a plate for $4.99.</p>
      <p>Lately, Del Taco has been on the cusp of fast food industry trends. For the past few years, it offered a lower-fat turkey taco, and it was among the first chains to embrace<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2019/06/20/plant-based-meat-may-be-a-restaurant-craze-but-taco-bell-says-its-holding-out/#2bb6ccad288b"> plant-based meat substitutes.</a></p>
      <p>Now, tamale lovers have another source for their holiday tables.</p>
