      <h1>The 6 A’s of Letting Go</h1>
      <h2>The Path to Personal Freedom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/vanessa-hamilton/" target="_blank">Vanessa Rochelle</a></address>
      <p>I have been conditioned to hold on tight to the ones I love. The harder I held on the more it showed my loyalty and commitment. I was an eager to please type that did not rock the boat. It appeared from the outside that I was smooth sailing into the sunset with my relationships in tow.</p>
      <p>I have been taught to hold on to my biggest wounds and negative emotions – a martyr disguised as a proud warrior that beat the battle. Life went on despite forgotten hurts hidden deep in the heart. Like a seasoned actor, I was trapped in playing roles in my own made up affairs.</p>
      <p>Letting go is a process. It is a conscious, self – perpetuating removal of ingrained thought and behaviour patterns that have been woven into my psyche for what seems like millennia. Letting go is a timeless exploration to my personal freedom. Timeless in the sense that letting go does not have an expected arrival or end date.</p>
      <p>The act of releasing is leading me to be my own person. I am creating my own belief systems, especially in regards to relationships, instead of recycling and reusing borrowed beliefs from others and society in general.</p>
      <p>On my path to self discovery I unearthed these 6 A’s to letting go – like an awe struck archeologist uncovering an ancient truth. There is no one right way to do it. Everyone needs to find their own way and I found mine.</p>
      <p>These 6 A’s did not occur in a well maintained linear manner. There were starts, stops, halts and leaps.  Over time it has become more effortless to incorporate each one simultaneously into my daily life.</p>
      <p><b>Amend</b> –  amending and healing past and current hurts helps me to free up space to live in the moment and connect with my inner Being, my source of wellness.</p>
      <p><b>Awareness</b> – being self – aware of my emotions, thoughts, reactions and responses gently guides me to consciously choose my experiences.</p>
      <p><b>Appreciate</b> – appreciation is the most efficient way to get into a state of joy and contentment. Gratitude provides me with a perspective that my life is a string of happy moments intertwined in the contrast of the world I live in.</p>
      <p><b>Accept</b> – accepting all what is releases my resistance, control and  expectations of how, when and where my life should unfold. </p>
      <p><b>Allow</b> – allowing myself to relax and breathe eliminates worries and struggles to get ahead.</p>
      <p><b>Anticipate</b> – anticipating what I desire in my life brings me into positive energetic alignment to receive it.</p>

      <p> It has taken me years to get to self – mastery of letting go. Now in my personal freedom I am relaxed, still and can appreciate the sunset alone.</p>
