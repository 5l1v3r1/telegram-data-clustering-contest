      <p>Makeup artist to the stars and influencers, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nikki_makeup/?hl=en">Nikki Wolff</a> knows a thing or two about makeup, creating flawless looks for her gals around the world (including the likes of Dua Lipa and Bella Hadid no less). Now, she shares her guide to achieving the ‘halo smoke’ look, a contemporary take on the classic smokey eye. Absolutely gorgeous.</p>
      <p>A smoky eye has forever been a go-to makeup look for so many, both day-to-night, but there are so many ways to do it. Here are my tips on how to achieve the most modern and adaptable smoky eye with a twist, that’s perfect for the party season.</p>

      <p>Like with any makeup look, perfect skin is the best starting point. It doesn’t matter how dramatic your eye look, I believe skin should always look natural and real. Skin prep is key for setting the intentions of how you want your skin texture to look: a good moisturiser is essential for keeping skin hydrated and ensuring that your base is applied seamlessly and even a nourishing sheet mask before that if your skin is looking and feeling lacklustre. For oily skin types, use an oil-control lotion in the T-zone area so your skin doesn’t look glowing in the wrong places. I also believe in using as little skincare products as possible before applying makeup so that your skin isn’t loaded with product – multitasking products such as SPF primers are a great way to add moisture, protection and prep the skin at once. I love Dior’s <a href="https://www.dior.com/en_gb/products/beauty-Y0460420_F046042020-diorsnow-brightening-tinted-fluid-colour-correction-second-skin-finish-spf50-pa+++?gclid=CjwKCAiA_MPuBRB5EiwAHTTvMdU7tLpyBptfDHoP_4cwpzn4Pn_ppkI1HmOqCr1FOd_uQSqsCCOlNRoCtl4QAvD_BwE">Diorsnow Brightening Makeup Base Colour Correction which has SPF 35</a> while also evening out the skin tone.</p>

      <p>Like lipstick, foundation comes down to personal preference and trial and error, but here are a few of my favorites that I keep in my kit for the most naturally-flawless bases.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Perfect-Reveal-Foundation-SPF25-GABBANA/dp/B010EDPLVK">Dolce &amp; Gabbana Perfect Reveal Lift</a>: I love this foundation to create a flawless, airbrushed complexion without looking heavy. It’s so lightweight that it looks like a second skin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dior.com/en_gb/products/beauty-Y0996041-dior-backstage-face-body-glow-universal-multi-use-highlighter-natural-glow-waterproof-sweat-resistant">Dior Backstage Face &amp; Body</a>: this buildable foundation provides the perfect amount of coverage for a luminous natural-looking base.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.shiseido.com/synchro-skin-self-refreshing-foundation-9990000000193.html">Shiseido Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation</a>: this weightless foundation uses a unique technology to synchronise with your skin and self-refresh for super radiant skin all day long.</p>
      <p>At this point in doing makeup, I like to take a break from the skin and move on to the eyes. This allows you to see exactly what the skin needs afterward. The first step is always prep and prime. I like to cover the lids with a thin layer of eyeshadow primer such as NARS Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base as this helps to keep the look perfect all day and night long, prevent creasing and fall-out from your eyeshadow.</p>
      <p>Next, a technique I love to use for any kind of smoky eye is to start with a black or brown kohl pencil and roughly sketch out the shape that I’m trying to create. For this look, I’d recommend sketching along the lash line, the inner and outer corners of the eye along the top and bottom. You can be as messy as you like with this, which is the beauty of this. Use a brush to blend out and soften the look. When the inner and outer parts are blended, use a soft fluffy brush to go over and blend further so that there are no hard lines. Keeping the liner to the inner and outer corner but blending keeps the intensity at just these areas, therefore creating a halo of light effect that runs through the centre of the lid.</p>
      <p>With a soft brown or taupe shadow and the same blending brush, put a light layer over the areas where you’ve applied the pencil which will help to set the look and prevent any smudging. </p>
      <p>Finish with lashings of mascara, or false eyelashes – my collaboration of lashes with <a href="https://sweedlashes.com/nikki-edition/">Sweed</a> are perfect for beginners or those who want a more natural lash look – the ‘No Lash Lash’ is a great way to add volume and length for subtle definition.</p>
      <p>Finally, finish with a blush and lipstick. Doing this step at the end is the best way to create a balanced look as you’ll be able to see what your skin needs.</p>
