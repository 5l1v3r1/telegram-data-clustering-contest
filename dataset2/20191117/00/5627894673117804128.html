      <p>DES MOINES, IOWA  Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg holds a clear lead among Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, the state that will hold the first nominating contest in February, a new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom opinion poll showed. <br/><br/>Buttigieg's support climbed to 25%, a 16-point increase since the previous survey in September, CNN reported. <br/>It said there was a close three-way battle for second with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at 16%, and former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders each at 15%. <br/><br/>Since September, Warren dropped six percentage points and Biden slipped five points, while Sanders gained four points, CNN said. <br/><br/>Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told the network the news was encouraging and his campaign felt growing momentum in the farm state, but there was "still a lot of work to do" in increasing his name recognition there. <br/><br/>Buttigieg also led Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa in a Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday. <br/>A New York Times/Sienna poll released earlier this month also showed Buttigieg's support surging in Iowa, but still behind Warren and Sanders. Nationally, he does not fare nearly as well, averaging around 8% in polls. <br/>Buttigieg's campaign is betting a strong finish in the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3 will help quell questions about whether he is ready for the big stage, and persuade reluctant black and Hispanic voters to give him a second look. <br/><br/>Buttigieg, 37, has invested heavily in Iowa from the start. <br/><br/>His campaign has more than 100 staffers and 20 offices in the state, among the most of any candidate.</p>
