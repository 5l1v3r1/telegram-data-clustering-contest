        <b>Ghana striker Jordan Ayew will have tougher competition at Crystal Palace as they are planning to sign Frenchman Odsonne Edouard took boost the firepower of the English Premier League side.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, who plays for Scottish side Celtic, has been in blistering from since the start of the season, prompting Palace to seek the signature of the striker.</p>
      <p>According to a report the Sun newspaper, Edouard is coach Roy Hodgson first-choice to solving the long-standing striker problem at the South London club where defensive midfielder Luka Milivojevic was the top scorer with 12 goals last season.</p>
      <p>Palace have scored 10 goals in 12 matches so far this season with Ayew scoring 4 goals while his fellow strikers  Christian Benteke and Wilfred Zaha are still goalless.</p>
      <p>With the Frenchman scoring eight times in 11 appearances while contributing five assists, Hodgson is targeting the striker to solve Palace's scoring problems.</p>
      <p>But Palace will have to prepare huge amounts of money to sign the former PSG striker for £9million in the summer of 2018 after a year's loan.</p>
      <p>Edouard's arrival will give a huge competition to Ayew who has been the most reliable striker for Palace this season.</p>
