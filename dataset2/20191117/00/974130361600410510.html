      <p>The direct route to Euro 2020 qualification for Ireland is to beat Denmark on Monday night.</p>
      <p>However, if Mick McCarthy's side does not beat Denmark, all hope of Euro 2020 qualification is not lost. Ireland could still qualify for the finals via the playoffs.</p>
      <p>The playoff places are decided based on the UEFA Nations League. Sweden's 2-0 victory over Romania on Friday night ensured that Ireland are guaranteed one of those 16 playoff places.</p>
      <p>The playoffs will be divided into four paths, determined by the Nations League rankings.</p>
      <p>The semi-finals of the paths take place on March 26th with the highest ranked team in each tie playing at home.</p>
      <p>The finals take place on March 31st with the hosts decided by a draw. The semi-finals and finals are both single leg ties.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland's chances of automatically qualifying for Euro 2020 ended on Sunday with a goalless draw against the Netherlands. They will take part in the playoffs.</p>
