      <p>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vermont-supreme-court/">Vermont Supreme Court</a> says a past finding of incompetence doesn’t mean a mentally ill man was still incompetent when he signed an advanced directive banning involuntary medication.</p>
      <p>The Rutland Herald reports that the decision, released Friday, rejected a family court suggestion that the patient lacked capacity to make the decision “merely because he continued to have a mental illness.”</p>
      <p>Justice Paul Reiber wrote there was insufficient evidence to support a decision to go against the 34-year-old man’s wishes.</p>
