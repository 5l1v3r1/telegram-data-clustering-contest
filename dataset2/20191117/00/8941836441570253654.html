      <p>The attendance figures for Sunday’s game between the Washington Redskins and New York Jets might be record-breaking, in the wrong kind of way.</p>
      <p>The late-season matchup at FedEx Field between two teams with a combined three wins had tickets available for as little as $6 on StubHub mere hours before kickoff Sunday.</p>

      <p>The Redskins have had difficulty attracting fans to Landover, Maryland, in recent years. The 2018 home opener against the Indianapolis Colts drew a meager 57,013, only 69.5% of the listed capacity of 82,000. Their most recent home contest this season, Week 7 against the San Francisco 49ers, reportedly drew 61,459 fans for a game played in torrential rain.</p>
      <p>Sunday’s weather for the Redskins’ (1-8) tilt with the Jets (2-7) is supposed to be cold but fair, yet the attendance could be worse. With about 90 minutes till kickoff, the stadium was virtually empty, when usually some fans have made their way to their seats to watch warmups by that time.</p>
