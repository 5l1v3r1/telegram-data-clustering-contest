      <p>During a hotel stay the other day, after noticing an Alexa, I asked her to turn herself off. I did not want “her” to eavesdrop on anything we said.</p>
      <p>Smart speakers and personal assistants are becoming ubiquitous. And they are very handy in families. As per a conversation on NPR’s 1A, the advantageous uses were many (I’ve added a few):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alarm clock</li>
        <li>Dim the lights</li>
        <li>Shopping lists</li>
        <li>Reminders to feed the dog or do some errand</li>
        <li>Scheduling children for the bathroom (different music for each child) or brushing teeth</li>
        <li>Answering the same question over and over (as young children may do)</li>
        <li>Find and play a podcast</li>
        <li>Tell jokes</li>
        <li>Parents can share experiences with children, like requesting a song you grew up with and having a dance party.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All these options seem helpful for busy families. But parents noted several obvious drawbacks of having a family Alexa:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>children can request a song dozens of times a day (as occurred with “Baby Shark” recently)</li>
        <li>replacing things a parent should do, like reading a bedtime story</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Will Alexa tell too much? For parents worried about answers to questions inappropriate for their child—such as, "Where do babies come from?"—<a href="https://redtri.com/how-alexa-responds-to-kids-questions-where-do-babies-come-from-santa-more/">Alexa creators have made a child-friendly “Free Time.” Parents can set limits, such as making Alexa unresponsive at homework or bed-time</a>. Echo Dot Kids has <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting">parenting</a> controls: no interaction past bedtime or during particular times like dinner time or homework.</p>
      <p>But there are other concerns. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/05/16/why-amazon-alexa-is-always-listening-to-your-conversations-analysis/#32a2eccc2378">Alexa is always “listening in” to family conversations</a>. In fact, Alexa is not a computer and cannot process requests locally but sends the request to Amazon’s cloud service for transcription before responding.</p>
      <p>Echo devices record and upload conversations that are analyzed by a team around the world. Amazon contends that this for improving consumer experience. This is monetization of private information. Who will end up seeing this information?</p>
      <p>Perhaps it is safe then to use a hotel’s smart speaker because presumably, the company would not go to the trouble of figuring out who stayed in the room on a particular day (right?). Maybe next time a hotel room has Alexa I’ll keep it on and have it play my favorite <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> songs.</p>
