      <p>STORRS, Conn. (AP) - Christian Vital scored 15 points and made a key late steal and UConn upset No. 15 Florida 62-59 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tyler Polley also scored 15 points, and Josh Carlton added 13 for the Huskies (2-1).</p>
      <p>A layup by Florida’s Keyontae Johnson with just over a minute to go cut the lead to 60-59, but those would be the last points the Gators scored. Vital hit two free throws with 17 seconds left and Florida had a chance to tie. But Alterique Gilbert tipped the ball out of Johnson’s hands and Vital grabbed it and dribbled away.</p>
