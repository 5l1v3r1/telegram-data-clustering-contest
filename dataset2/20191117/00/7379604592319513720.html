        <figcaption>Jane Moore will be on the judging panel as we give away £1million to charities you choose</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Over the last half century you have generously donated as much as £100million to charities that help those in need.</p>
      <p>You have stood shoulder to shoulder with the people’s paper as we campaigned against injustices, holding the powerful to account and giving a voice to the voiceless.</p>
      <p>Sun readers are the ordinary people of Britain who do extraordinary things every single day.</p>
      <p>The respected Society of Editors has given The Sun and its readers a special award for 50 years of campaigning.</p>
      <p>And today WE are proud to launch a special £1MILLION Sun Readers Fund which we want YOU to donate to your favourite causes.</p>
      <p>We would like you to tell us about the small, local charities you support and nominate them for a donation of between £2,000 and £20,000 from Britain’s best-selling paper.</p>
      <p>Throughout the next year we will make dozens of donations on your behalf to help the UK charities you back carry out their vital work.</p>
      <p>Maybe your chosen charity needs money to buy a wheelchair for disabled youngsters or you know an old folks’ club that could do with a mini bus.</p>
      <p>Perhaps a small organisation that supports veterans or the homeless could do with a badly-needed injection of cash to complete a vital project.</p>
      <p>Your local rescue team might be short of equipment, an animal sanctuary perhaps wants to build a new shelter or a British-based organisation that helps vulnerable people abroad is in need of vital medicines.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>All over the UK there are thousands of local causes that could do with a bit of extra help.</p>
      <p>And thanks to our £1million Sun Readers’ Fund they could get the cash to make little miracles happen.</p>
      <p>The money is there but we need you to let us know who to give it to.</p>
      <p>Between now and December 18, you can nominate you favourite small charity and tell us in up 400 words why they deserve a donation.</p>
      <h3>MAKE A DIFFERENCE</h3>
      <p>We will make donations of up to £20,000 to small – sometimes unsung – charities in six categories. They are:</p>
      <p>Children and Young People; Health and Wellbeing; Veterans; Animals and the Environment; Emergency Heroes and International Aid.</p>
      <p>If your favourite small charity falls into one of those categories then why not nominate them for donation of two and twenty grand. You could make a real difference to them and their much-needed work.</p>
      <p>Sun columnist and TV presenter Jane Moore is a member of the Sun panel that will select the charities that will receive money on your behalf.</p>
      <p>She said: “Since 1969, The Sun has been the people’s paper. Standing up for ordinary folk, and shining a spotlight on the extraordinary things they’re capable of achieving for themselves, their loved ones and their communities.</p>
      <p>“Across the last five decades The Sun has proudly championed the causes its readers care about – from finding forever families for vulnerable children to changing the law to ensure victims of domestic abuse are provided with safe accommodation.</p>
      <p>“The Sun50 Reader Fund is undoubtedly going to create a whole new generation of inspirational stories as readers nominate the charities that have touched their lives.”</p>
      <p>It couldn’t be easier to nominate your favourite cause – see the details below and submit the form at the top of this article.</p>
      <h4>HOW TO NOMINATE YOUR CHARITY</h4>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 1.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You have until December 18 but why not do it now.</p>
      <p>Your chosen charity must be registered with either the Charity Commission , the Scottish Charity Regulator or the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>You must include the charity’s registration number.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 2.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fill out your name, address and phone number, then give us the details of the charity you are nominating. </p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 3.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tell us which of our six categories is relevant to your charity  </p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 4.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Write up to 400 words explaining what your charity does, why it is close to your heart, how much funding your charity needs and what that funding will do. </p>
      <p>Tell us about your connection to the charity. Maybe you, your family or friends have received support.  Do you work or volunteer there?</p>
      <p>Make sure to tell us what area of the UK or abroad the funds will benefit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>STEP 5.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And finally, the important bit. Tell us how much money you are requesting between £2,000 and £20,000.</p>
      <p> Please note there are a limited number of larger grants available.</p>
      <p> The Sun Readers’ Fund panel, that decides who gets what and how much, will be looking to donate the majority of the £1million as small grants to help as many good causes as possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BY POST</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you don’t have access to the internet, post your nomination to: Sun Readers’ Fund, The Sun, 1, London Bridge Street, London SE1 9GF. </p>
      <p>This is your opportunity to tell us all about a charity close to your heart.</p>
      <p>We will also ask you to let us know how much your charity needs for that special project or to improve the work they do.</p>
      <p>We are particularly looking to help charities with small projects that will make a big difference.</p>
      <p>Once we have received your nomination and if your chosen charity is shortlisted, we will contact them direct for more details.</p>
      <p>The charity will be asked to complete an application form to be considered for a grant. The money will be sent directly to your charity.</p>
      <h3>JUDGES’ FAVOURITES</h3>

        <figcaption>The Sun’s Jane Moore, Deidre Sanders, Dan Wootton, Trevor Kavanagh, Arthur Edwards, Jo Bucci and Help for Heroes spokesman Derek Derenalagi will select the winning entries</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A panel of famous faces from The Sun will decide which charities should be awarded money and how much they will get.</p>
      <p>On the panel will be Jane Moore, the nation’s agony aunt Deidre Sanders, political columnist Trevor Kavanagh, Royal photographer Arthur Edwards, Executive Editor Dan Wootton, The Sun’s General Manager Jo Bucci and Help for Heroes spokesman Derek Derenalagi.</p>
      <p>We will only contact you if your nominated charity has been successful.</p>
      <p>The Sun Readers Fund will distribute more than 100 grants over the next 12 months, so please don’t expect a response immediately.</p>
      <p>But if your nomination is successful you can be sure that you have made a difference.</p>
      <p>Sun columnist and TV presenter Lorraine Kelly says: “The Sun’s ‘thanks a million’ charity giveaway is a wonderful birthday present to give readers.</p>
      <p>“There are so many deserving causes at a national or local level.</p>
      <p>“Do you volunteer for a brilliant local organisation that needs a helping hand? Or have you benefited from amazing help from a charity and now you want to help them?</p>
      <p>“Make sure you fill in the form online and nominate a cause close to your heart who is in need for funds for a project.”</p>
      <p>The Sun Readers Fund will make donations to small UK charities in six categories.</p>
      <p>Remember, to qualify for a grant, the organisation you are nominating must be registered with the Charity Commission – or Scottish and Northern Ireland equivalents and have a charity number.</p>
