      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/sylvan-esso-10-piece-band-tour-begins-next-week-enter-to-win-nyc-tix/">Sylvan Esso, Daughter of Swords @ Beacon Theatre</a></b><br/>Electronic/folk fusion duo Sylvan Esso bring their ambitious live setup to Beacon Theatre for two special shows where they’re expanded to a 10-member lineup featuring some of the duo’s favorite musicians, including Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner on bass, Meg Duffy of Hand Habits on lead guitar, Adam Schatz of Landlady on saxophone, and more. Should be cool.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/anderson-paak-playing-benefit-show-in-nyc-free-nationals-chronixx-share-new-song/">Anderson .Paak, The Free Nationals @ Brooklyn Steel</a></b><br/>Although Anderson .Paak’s backing band The Free Nationals released some material on their own recently, the two will play together as usual for this sold-out benefit show sponsored by Modelo, which aims to help “refugees, immigrants and Americans in need.”</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11105533">Kim Petras, Alex Chapman @ Avant Gardner</a></b><br/>Pop singer Kim Petras concludes her two-night stand at Brooklyn’s Avant Gardner tonight, behind her infectious debut album <i>Clarity</i>, released earlier this year.</p>

They’re the real deal and their live show is something else.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/david-byrne-now-on-broadway-cast-recording-released-check-out-an-opening-night-video/">David Byrne’s American Utopia @ Hudson Theatre</a></b><br/>David Byrne has retooled his acclaimed “untethered” 2018 for the Broadway stage and while the setlist and arrangements are much like what they were on his tour, songs are now threaded together with new monologues from Byrne, making for a much more theatrical experience.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11227814">David Cross @ Littlefield</a></b><br/>David Cross tested out the stand-up material that became the 2018 Oh Come On tour at a bunch of shows he called “Shootin’ the Shit, Seein’ What Sticks” that mostly happened at Brooklyn’s Union Hall. He’s shooting the shit again with another series of shows at Littlefield.</p>

Hall), Miss Guy, Malang Jobarteh @ Mercury Lounge</a></b><br/>Trio Princess Goes to the Butterfly Museum is led by Michael C Hall who you may know from <i>Six Feet Under</i> and <i>Dexter</i>, or from his musical work starring in <i>Hedwig &amp; The Angry Inch</i> and David Bowie’s <i>Lazarus</i>. The rest of the band — they all met as part of <i>Hedwig</i> — is made up of keyboardist Matt Katz-Bohen (Blondie, Culture Club, Cyndi Lauper) and drummer Peter Yanowitz (Morningwood).</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/zola-jesus-purple-pilgrims-more-playing-audiofemme-party-in-nyc/">Zola Jesus, Mothica, Jess Williamson, Purple Pilgrims @ Rosewood Theater</a></b><br/>Zola Jesus will be playing a solo piano set at this party thrown by NYC-based, women and non-binary people run music and culture blog Audiofemme, who celebrates their relaunch.

      <p><b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/451506418831761/?event_time_id=451506432165093">Shilpa Ray, Odetta Hartman, Joanna Schubert, Emmerson &amp; Her Clammy Hands @ The Footlight</a></b><br/>Shilpa Ray’s husky wail and darkly textured songs has made fans of Nick Cave (who put out one of her EPs) among many others. Her intense live shows are always worth seeing.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11154416">Sunrot, exhalants, The Austerity Program @ Trans-Pecos</a></b><br/>This bill has two local staples, NJ sludgesters and NYC post-hardcore/noise rockers The Austerity Program, and touring band exhalants (from Austin) are cut from a similar cloth as the latter.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/whats-going-on-sunday-185/brooklynvegan.com/itasca-shares-lily-off-new-album-touring/">Itasca, Sleepy Doug Shaw, Starway @ Union Pool</a></b><br/>LA’s Itasca is a very good revivalist of ’60s/’70s-style psychedelic folk, and this year’s <i>Spring</i> is another fine example of this.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/lifetime-playing-fall-shows-with-gouge-away-night-birds-more/">Lifetime, Night Birds, Gouge Away, Truth Cult @ House of Independents</a></b><br/>NJ melodic hardcore heroes Lifetime only rarely play shows these days, so the chance to see them is always worth taking. They’re doing a three-date Northeast tour this weekend with Florida post-hardcore crushers Gouge Away, and tonight they play their home state with another great NJ punk band, Night Birds.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11100710">Cherie Currie, Brie Darling @ (le) poisson rouge</a></b><br/>Punk icon and former Runaways vocalist Cherie Currie, along with collaborator Brie Darling, released <i>The Motivator</i> this year, which features a blend of original songs and covers of T.
