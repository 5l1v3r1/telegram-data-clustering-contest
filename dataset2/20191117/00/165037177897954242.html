        <b>PSG are eyeing the market looking to sign a central defender. They are looking at Samuel Umtiti, who has lost importance at Barcelona because of his injuries.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> <b>are running out of patience with </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-umtiti-127121/">Samuel Umtiti</a>. A player who was destined to become a great central defender for France has had numerous injuries. </p>
      <p><b>The fact he has a contract at Barca until 2023</b> does not mean that his future at the club is not under question. </p>
      <p>He has not played two consecutive games for Barcelona since 2018 and <b>his constant knee injuries have caused Barca to run out of patience </b>with him. </p>

      <p>But despite that almost endless list of injuries, there is<b> a team who are willing to give him another chance</b>, according to 'El Desmarque'. </p>
      <p>Nasser Al-Khelaifi is looking for the formula to freshen up his defence and the Frenchman would be an option <b>who they could buy at a good price</b> after not playing much. </p>
      <p>It would be a risky move <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/paris-saint-germain-fc/">PSG</a>, but <b>they need a replacement for Thiago Silva</b> as soon as possible. </p>
