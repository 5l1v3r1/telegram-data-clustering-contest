      <p>There’s a lot more to the upcoming FiveSixZero fest than a concert. It will also host a two-day summit to discuss trends in the music industry. Under its ‘Masterclass’ property, listen to stalwarts share their secrets about production, mixing and mastering, composing &amp; arranging, pioneer equipment features and more. Whereas, Pitch Demo is a space where music-makers can drop their demo to various record labels and get feedback from producers. Now, meet some of the speakers of the summit, such as Ricky Kej, who will deliver the keynote address. <br/><br/><b>Ricky Kej</b> <br/><br/>Grammy award winner, US Billboard No 1 artist, UNESCO’s Global Ambassador for Kindness, and UNICEF’s Celebrity Supporter, Ricky Kej has many feathers to his cap. His repertoire includes 16 studio albums released internationally, over 3,500 commercials and four feature films, including the natural history documentary Wild Karnataka narrated by Sir David Attenborough. From Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Peter Gabriel, Peter Yarrow and Soweto Gospel Choir to Amitabh Bachchan, Shankar Mahadevan, Rick Allen and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, he’s collaborated with all. <br/><br/><b>Miguel Pardo</b> <br/><br/>He is the director of the legendary Pacha Group, Ibiza.
