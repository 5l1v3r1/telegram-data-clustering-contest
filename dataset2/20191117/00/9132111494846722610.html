      <p>The Ambassador of Mexico to Ghana, H.E. Maria de los Angeles Arriola Aguirre has called on the international community to pay critical attention to cultural diplomacy as a tool that can foster mutual understanding and bring about global economic development.</p>
      <p>According to the Mexican Ambassador, the purpose of cultural diplomacy between countries is to develop an understanding of a nation’s ideals in an effort to build broad support for economic and political goals.</p>
      <p>H.E. Maria de los Angeles Arriola Aguirre was speaking on the occasion of the National Mexican gastronomy day which took place at the Kempinski gold coast city hotel here in Accra.</p>
      <p>The night saw the display of Mexican dishes each reflecting the unique Mexican style. Guests were treated to the unique traditional Mexican dishes such as pozole, a pre-hispanic soup and quesadillas made of tortilla and cheese, huitlacoche made from Maize mushroom, potato and Guacamole with a sweet licor called Rompope and for dessert was churros with cajeta and Torrejas.</p>
      <p>Mexico’s gastronomy generates so much revenue for the country’s agricultural sector creating jobs and boosting its economy.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named the Mexican gastronomy as an intangible Heritage of Humanity and in 2016, Mexico’s Government through the Ministry of tourism declared November 16 each year as the National Mexican Gastronomy Day to boost the natural and cultural wealth of Mexico.</p>
      <p>Celebrated every year, the National Mexican gastronomy day brought together the Latin American diplomatic missions here in Ghana, the Mexican community and some friends of the embassy.</p>
