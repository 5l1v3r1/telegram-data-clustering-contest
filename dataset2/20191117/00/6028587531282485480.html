      <p><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> may have released without the battle royale feature that more or less defined <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops </i>at launch, but it looks like the large-scale, winner-take-all conflict might be returning after all. Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">Senscallo recently posted on reddit </a>about the planned battle royale update for the shooter, and there’s some interesting stuff here for fans either of Call of Duty or for Battle Royale. For starters, the most important information here is that the mode is absolutely massive. Battle Royale has stuck at or near the idea of a 100-player match ever since <i>PUBG</i> established the format, but <i>Modern Warfare</i> is going to blow that up with a 200-player game mode complete with the usual options for solos, duos and squads.</p>
      <p>The images aren’t appearing on the original post anymore, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-16-massive-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-datamine-reveals-loads-of-battle-royale-details">Eurogamer still has pictures of the supposed map</a>, which contains the entire maps from the games other modes inside of it: you need a lot of space for 200 players, after all.</p>
      <p>There’s a ton of information in the leak, but by far the most interesting twist is the Gulag, where you go when you die in the main game. When you’re there you can win your way back into the match through a 1 vs. 1 fight. Only 2 players fight at any given moment while the rest watch, with a countdown showing how long until they’ve got until they can win their spot back. Every once in a while there might also be a jailbreak that would kick all the players in the Gulag back into the match.</p>
      <p>Some of the most interesting work in recent battle royale involves the idea of respawns, and this is one of the best systems I’ve heard of yet. It manages to keep players engaged in the match without sacrificing the concept of high-stakes combat that makes the entire battle royale concept tick.</p>
      <p>There’s also the concept of “plunder”, which appears at first blush to be lifted from Boss Key’s short-lived game <i>Radical Heights</i>. Plunder is a currency that you earn by completing missions or eliminating enemies, and that you can deposit at ATMs in the game for persistent experience. Depositing at an ATM will cause an alarm to go off, however, broadcasting your position to the enemy.</p>
      <p>All in all, there’s a ton of interesting stuff going on here. What we’re seeing so far is a world away from the aggressive simplicity that catapulted battle royale to a worldwide phenomenon, but that’s part of how these things evolve. Battle Royale has always been a kind of small-scale MMO, and it’s that side of things that I’m seeing most in these early leaks. Very interested to see where this goes, so stay tuned.</p>
