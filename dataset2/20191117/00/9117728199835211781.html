      <h3>Verstappen takes pole in Brazil</h3>
      <p>At the track where his race ended so dramatically last season, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> came back stronger this year, taking pole position ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman's electric 1:07.508 beat <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> to the punch on Saturday afternoon, meaning Verstappen now has his second (official) pole position. </p>
      <p>There was drama as well, with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> not being able to set any times with his engine malfunctioning - a very interesting afternoon in Sao Paulo!</p>

      <h3>Vettel: "Red Bull pace a little suspicious"</h3>
      <p>In the post-qualifying press conference, Vettel jokingly hit back at Verstappen's comments from two weeks ago by saying <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a>'s pace in qualifying was <i>"a little suspicious"</i> with a big smile.</p>
      <p>The four-time champion was obviously referencing to Verstappen, who said in the United States <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a>'s pace had dropped off <i>"because they can't cheat anymore"</i>. A few days before that Grand Prix, Red Bull had enquired about the regulations regarding fuel flow into the engine, with suspicions arising Ferrari were breaking rules on that front. Coincidentally, Ferrari had a very slow race weekend directly after the enquiry, leading to Verstappen's 'cheating' comment.</p>
      <p>Ferrari were right up to speed again at Interlagos, however, and Vettel couldn't help himself but to have a little dig.</p>

      <h3>Villeneuve slates Hulkenberg: "He's very lucky to always be paid to race"</h3>
      <p>Jacques Villeneuve seemingly can't stay away from controversy as the Canadian this time targeted departing <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a>.</p>
      <p>The German has no drive for 2020 in F1 and most likely will not get one, leading to Villeneuve's comments about the one-time pole-sitter, who said Hulkenberg has overstayed his welcome in the sport already and that he's lucky to still be paid to drive in it.</p>
      <p>The former world champion is also certain Hulkenberg won't be returning to the grid once he's off it.</p>

      <h3>Corinna Schumacher re-states Michael's health remains a private matter</h3>
      <p>In a new interview with Corinna Schumacher, wife of seven-time F1 world champion Michael Schumacher, she talked about her husband's health and her desire to keep it private, as it has been since the German's skiing accident in 2013.</p>
      <p>Corinna also revealed Michael is up-to-date about son Mick's progress in Formula 2 although she did not go into further detail.</p>
