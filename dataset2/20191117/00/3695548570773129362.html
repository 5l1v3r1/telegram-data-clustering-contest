        <b>Lewis Hamilton said he accepts full responsibility for the Brazilian Grand Prix collision with Alex Albon that led to him being penalised by the Formula 1 stewards.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton knocked Albon's Red Bull into a spin at the tight Bico de Pato corner on the infield while trying to reclaim second with one lap to go following a late pitstop for fresh tyres during a safety car period.</p>
      <p>Though Hamilton crossed the line in third and took part in the podium ceremony, he was already under investigation and was given a five-second time penalty soon afterwards - dropping him to seventh in the results.</p>
      <p>He had expressed remorse for the incident in immediate post-race interviews and underlined after the penalty that he had no qualms about accepting blame for the tangle.</p>
      <p>"I've got a penalty. I totally accept the blame as I was coming from behind," said Hamilton.</p>
      <p>"You don't hardly ever see me do that, collisions with anyone.</p>
      <p>"In hindsight, I could have waited to come across the line, but hindsight is always a great thing."</p>

      <p>The clash cost rookie Albon what would have been his first F1 podium. He finished 14th.</p>
      <p>"We'll live to fight another day and that won't be the last time that he's in position for a podium and he'll have many more great races," said Hamilton of Albon.</p>
      <p>"So I hope, as hard as it is a pill to swallow, that he can learn from the experience also."</p>
      <p>Albon admitted he was "upset" to lose a potential second place but understood why Hamilton tried the move.</p>
      <p>"Of course he didn't mean to do it. I'm not angry at Lewis," he added.</p>
      <p>He suggested that Hamilton had been in a hurry to overtake him because he still felt he had an opportunity to catch leader Max Verstappen, which Hamilton confirmed.</p>
      <p>"It's always a big question of when is the right time to try it," said Hamilton.</p>
      <p>"We only had a lap and a half to go. An opportunity came up, I was quicker through Turn 9 [Pinheirinho].</p>
      <p>"And I was in shooting distance, so I gave it a shot.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately, in my mind, I'm trying to catch Max. It's highly unlikely, but that was the goal."</p>
