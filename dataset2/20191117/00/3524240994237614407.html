      <p>Hundreds of motorists and travellers were left stranded for many hours on Saturday when some trucks drivers barricaded the two lanes of the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway at the Papalantoro bus stop in the Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State.</p>
      <p>The truck drivers, said to be from Dangote cement, reportedly abandoned the trucks after blocking the expressway.</p>
      <p>The action subjected travellers and motorists to hardship as many of them were forced to trek long distances.</p>
      <p>Our correspondent, who visited the scene, was told that the development was due to a clash between the drivers and officials of Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps in the state.</p>
      <p>Some truck drivers accused TRACE officials of seizing their trucks for parking by the roadside.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness, Olalekan Abudullah said the incident started around 8pm on Friday and escalated by Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said, “The issue started when the officials of TRACE towed away two trucks belonging to Lafarge cement, which were parked by the roadside, to their office.</p>
      <p>“Although the rift was later settled, Dangote truck drivers who joined their Lafarge counterpart insisted that the seized trucks must be returned to where they were seized.</p>
      <p>Another eyewitness, who identified himself simply as Ayuba, said the TRACE men also seized a Dangote truck which was parked by the roadside.</p>
      <p>“The drivers pleaded but the TRACE men ignored them. I think that was the reason why the truck drivers decided to block the road.”</p>
      <p>Men of the Nigeria Police, the Nigerian Army and the Federal Road Safety Corps were seen at the scene controlling traffic.</p>
      <p>The Public Relations Officer for TRACE, Babatunde Akinbiyi, accused Dangote truck drivers of indiscipline and impunity.</p>
      <p>He explained that men of TRACE worked through the night to ensure a  free flow of traffic on the expressway, but their efforts were allegedly thwarted by the truck drivers.</p>
