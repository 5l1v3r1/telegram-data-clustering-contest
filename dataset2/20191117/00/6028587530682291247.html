      <p>In one of the most boring main events you’ll see, Jan Blachowicz edged Jacare Souza via split decision in the latter’s light heavyweight debut on Saturday night in Sao Paulo, Brazil.The fight was devoid of any real action or memorable moments which made it incredibly difficult to score. As usual, Souza cried foul when he didn’t get the decision, but truthfully, neither man asserted themselves and the winner was a real toss up.</p>

        <b>Renan Barao is Finished</b>

      <p>The former UFC Bantamweight Champion moved up to featherweight after years of struggling to make 135 pounds. He looked as healthy and fresh as I can remember since his title reign, but Barao simply doesn’t have that burst and snap that he did a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he’s taking a lot of punishment in each of his fights. Douglas Silva de Andrade is an explosive physical specimen, but if Barao is getting battered and losing a one-sided unanimous decision to him, it’s proof the latter is way past his prime.</p>
      <p>Some fighters can remain effective way past 32 years of age, but Barao looks like a fighter with far too much mileage on him.</p>

        <b>Randy Brown is What We Hoped Curtis Millender Would Be</b>
      </p>

      <p>Curtis Millender is a calm, cool and collected fighter with devastating striking. However, he couldn’t handle opponents taking him down, and thus he took back-to-back losses and was recently released by the UFC. I thought the trigger on that decision was a bit premature considering the records of some guys and girls I’ve seen on the roster. Still, there is no doubt Millender underachieved.</p>
      <p>Randy Brown has a similar skill set and frame, but he has added layers to his game and learned from Octagon mistakes. He was masterful in submitting the athletic and surging Warlley Alves on Saturday. Many thought Alves might have an advantage over the American on the ground, but that wasn’t the case. Brown expertly set up a triangle choke to force the impressive submission.</p>
      <p>He is evolving and that could be a bad news for the UFC’s welterweight division.</p>

        <b>Charles Oliveira Has Become Lightweight Title Contender</b>
      </p>

      <p>We know Charles Oliveira holds records for submissions and he’s near the top of the list in finishes and bonuses. It’s time we start thinking of him as a legit title contender at 155 pounds.</p>
      <p>He came into Saturday’s bout with Jared Gordon ranked No. 13 in the division. After his first-round KO win, it’s possible he could move up. Oliveira’s submission skills are already among the best in the world, but it also appears his striking is on the rise. He called out Conor McGregor and Paul Felder during his post-fight interview.</p>
      <p>If we’re being honest, he’s not going to get McGregor, but a rematch with Felder–who is the last man to beat him before the current six-fight win streak–is more realistic.</p>

        <b>Shogun Did Just Enough For Him To Think He Should Keep Fighting</b>
      </p>

      <p>It’s tough watching Shogun Rua take punishment in the Octagon at this stage of his career. On Saturday, the usually modest-striking Paul Craig pounded Shogun in the first round and caused swelling on the Brazilian legend’s face. Shogun held top control throughout the second frame, though he did no damage. The third round was similar until Craig got to his feet, landing some strikes and secured his own takedown in the final 15 seconds.</p>
      <p>The judges render it a split draw, which is a permissible result based on the action in the Octagon. The bad part about this result is that it wasn’t definitive, and that will likely mean Shogun will fight on. He is a former Pride Grand Prix winner and UFC Light Heavyweight champion, but he’s nothing more than a brawler with poor defense at this point in his career.</p>
      <p>If he’s matched with anyone capable of putting combination strikes together, he’s going to take an unnecessary KO loss. Pardon me, but that’s not something I’m dying to see.</p>
