      <p>CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) - A couple who manage a Chandler assisted living facility have pleaded guilty to vulnerable adult abuse.</p>
      <p>The charges stem from the August death of a resident who went two days without air conditioning.</p>
      <p>State prosecutors say Joseph Somera and Lolita Somera, both 56, operated Happy Homes Assisted Living Facility.</p>
      <p>They say Lolita Somera has already been sentenced to 90 days in jail.</p>
      <p>After the woman completes her term, prosecutors say she will be turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because she’s in the country illegally.</p>

      <p>The air conditioning at the facility reportedly failed on Aug. 16 in 109-degree weather.</p>
