        <li>Manufacturers are planning to invest, on an annual basis, 3.24% of their revenue for the next three years. The amount of the investment plan is 1.7 times more than the amount annually invested for the last three years.</li>
        <li>Manufacturers plan to build 40% more smart factories in the next five years and increase their annual investments by 1.7 times compared to the last three years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These and many other insights are from the <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/research-institute/">Capgemini Research Institute</a> report, <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/research/smart-factories-at-scale/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=digman_none_none_pressrelease_none&amp;utm_campaign=digitalmanufacturing_cri_smartfactories">Smart Factories @ Scale</a>. You can <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Report-%E2%80%93-Smart-Factories.pdf">download a copy of the report here</a> (48 pp., PDF, no opt-in). Capgemini’s research team identified the two main challenges of achieving smart factory production levels are the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems, and the need to find job candidates with the range expertise, knowledge, and skills to lead smart factories. Capgemini found that smart factory initiatives are challenging to excel at, with 14% of manufacturers characterizing their initiatives as successful. The study is based on a survey 1,000 manufacturers, focusing on organizations that had a smart factory initiative underway. Please see pages 42 and 43 of the report for the methodology. Key insights from the study include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems are considered essential technologies for succeeding at smart factory initiatives.</b> Manufacturers are taking a pragmatic, proven approach to defining and launching smart factory initiatives, relying on longstanding systems their operations teams use daily. Real-time monitoring is the onramp to lights-out manufacturing (or completely automated manufacturing shifts) in plastics and processing industries. Manufacturing executives interviewed see real-time monitoring as providing the contextually rich real-time data stream that enables long-standing technologies like track-and-trace and emerging new technologies (analytics &amp; AI, Industrial IoT, robotics, and smart energy management) to deliver results.  </li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>China, Germany, and Japan are the top three countries in smart factory adoption, closely followed by South Korea, the United States, and France.</b> Capgemini created a smart factory adoption index to more accurately rank each country. If a country or a sector achieves a score greater than 1, it signifies a more aggressive expansion plan than the average. The following graphic compares country scores:</li>

        <li><b>Nearly 70% of manufacturers are pursuing smart factory initiatives today, a significant increase since 2017.</b> Just 43% of manufacturers had smart factory initiatives underway two years ago. Today, 68% of them do. Most of the organizations that were planning smart factory initiatives two years ago (33%) have now launched them.<i> “There are three primary reasons why we took up the smart factory initiative,” </i>explains Dr. Seshu Bhagavatula, President, New Technologies and Business Initiatives, Ashok Leyland, one of the largest heavy vehicle manufacturers in India. <i>“The first is to improve the productivity of our old factories through modernizing and digitizing their operations. The second is to deal with the quality issues that are difficult for human beings to detect. And the third is to incorporate made-to-order or mass-customization capabilities.”</i></li>

        <li><b>The Power, Energy, and Utilities industry lead all others in smart factory progress so far and is above the global average.</b> Discrete manufacturers have the most ambitious plans of all, with a projected 43% of all production centers converted into smart factories within five years. Discrete manufacturing also leads all other industries on the adoption index through the forecast period, further underscoring the industries’ aggressive plans to compete with smart factories.</li>

        <li><b>40% of production facilities, on average, are using MES/SCADA solutions today</b>. In the same way, 40% use PLM for discrete manufacturing and consumer products. Newer solutions, such as remote monitoring, mobile/augmented worker (AR/VR), and manufacturing intelligence (from Industrial IoT to analytics and AI), are yet to be deployed at more than two-thirds of the production lines on average.</li>

        <li><b>52% of manufacturers consider integrating MES/SCADA systems with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) a critical requirement for their smart factory initiatives</b>. Just over half, 48%, believe integration to Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems as essential to smart factory initiative’s success. Surprisingly, only 40% of manufacturers taking on smart factory initiatives have an end-to-end integrated platform that spans from device to analytics.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Three core technologies enable smart factories.</b> These are connectivity (leveraging Industrial IoT to collect data from existing equipment and new sensors), intelligent automation (e.g., advanced robotics, machine vision, distributed control, drones), and cloud-scale data management and analytics (e.g., implementing predictive analytics/AI). Capgemini found that these digital technologies will also enable IT-OT convergence to support end-to-end digital continuity from design to operations (digital twin).</li>
        <li><b>55% of manufacturers are including Greenfield projects in their smart factory initiatives.</b> Capgemini found that Greenfield projects are particularly prevalent among small and mid-sized companies (those with annual revenues below $10B). For example, in the $5B to $10B revenue bracket, Greenfield projects represent 59% of initiatives in 2019, up from 50% in 2017.</li>
