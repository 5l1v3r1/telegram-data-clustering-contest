      <h3>TOP STORY: Man United face PSG competition for Sancho</h3>
      <p>Rarely a day goes by without <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/259836/Jadon-Sancho">Jadon Sancho</a></b> being linked with a move back to England -- or anywhere else in Europe for that matter. And this evening is no different.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Express claims that Paris Saint-Germain are set to join the battle for his signature and have made him their top transfer target next summer. All of which looks set to spark more speculation over the future of <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/132948/Neymar">Neymar</a>, who like Sancho, rarely finds himself off the TT pages. Let the battle commence.</p>
      <h3>Messi contract talks underway</h3>
      <p>The future destination of <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/45843/Lionel-Messi">Lionel Messi</a></b> is always a good subject for discussion, but any clubs looking to lure the Argentine superstar away from Barcelona will be disappointed to hear that he is already in talks with the Spanish giants over a new deal.</p>
      <p>Tongues were set wagging earlier this year when it was revealed that Messi would be available on a free transfer at the end of whichever season he eventually walks away from the Nou Camp. He has now been at the club for 18 years, but Barca's sporting director Eric Abidal has confirmed that talks are already underway to keep him at the club beyond 2021 -- the year when his current deal expires.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191116/471663800811/entrevista-md-avance-eric-abidal-barca-renovacion-messi-ansu-fati.html">Mundo Deportivo</a>, Abidal said it was too soon to comment on progress but was hopeful a deal could be concluded.</p>
      <h3>Manchester United set to enter race for Baggies loanee</h3>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could look to snap up <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/216098/Matheus-Pereira">Matheus Pereira</a></b> after the Brazilian's impressive loan spell at Championship pace-setters West Brom. That's according to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-eyeing-matheus-pereira-20897155">the Mirror</a>, with the paper reporting that the Brazilian's form at the Hawthorns has caught the eye of an Old Trafford hierarchy desperate to inject some creativity into the squad.</p>
      <p>The Baggies currently have the option to snap up Pereira for £8.25m. But Manchester United, along with a host of other top clubs, have made it clear that they wouldn't think twice about making a move for him. The 23-year-old Sporting Lisbon winger, who spent last season on loan with Bundesliga club Nuremburg, has been a hit with the Baggies so far. And heads, like opposing full-backs, have been turned.</p>
      <h3>Tap-ins</h3>
      <p>-- You have to admire <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/11001/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a></b>'s sense of self-worth -- although clubs in the apparent race for his signature might have something to say about it. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10358823/ibrahimovic-milan-200k-week-italy-return/">The Sun reports</a> that the Swede is asking for £215,000 a week -- that's not a misprint -- to return to Serie A following his decision to leave MLS club LA Galaxy. AC Milan and Bologna are both reported to be keen on bringing him back to Italy. Those wage demands, though, might temper their enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>-- <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/95469/Edinson-Cavani">Edinson Cavani</a></b>'s agent is bullish in his belief that the Uruguayan won't be short of offers should he become available at the end of the season. The Paris Saint-Germain legend is widely expected to leave the club when his contract expires at the end of the campaign -- and Walter Guglielmone is confident he won't be short of offers. Speaking to <a href="https://www.calcionapoli1926.it/?refresh_ce-cp">CalcioNapoli1926</a>, he said: "Edi still has three years to play at the highest level and he can play in any major team in Europe."</p>
      <p>-- <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/102251/Ivan-Rakitic">Ivan Rakitic</a></b> could be persuaded to move to AC Milan -- as long as the Italian giants can come to an agreement on both his wages and his transfer fee. <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/exclusive-two-obstacles-milan-need-to-overcome-in-rakitic-pursui-42836">According to Calciomercato</a>, his current wages of €7.8 million a season are a major stumbling block, as is Barcelona's current asking price of €35 million. So there you have it. Over to you, Milan.</p>
