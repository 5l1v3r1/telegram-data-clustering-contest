      <p>A strike that kept students in the Victoria area from classes for three weeks is over after union members voted to accept a contract agreement reached over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Support workers, including education assistants and custodians at 18 schools in the Saanich district, were on strike over wages since Oct. 28, leaving about 7,000 students out of class.</p>
      <p>Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 441 president Dean Coates says CUPE members will be back in classrooms as schools reopen Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Coates did not provide many details about the deal, but says the union and school district were able to come significantly closer to wage parity within the region.</p>
      <p>Coates says in a union news release the agreement includes general wage increases of two per cent in each year of the three-year contract.</p>
      <p>He says the union represents 500 workers in the school district.</p>
