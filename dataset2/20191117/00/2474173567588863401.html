      <h1>5 Anti-Frizz Hair Products Tried &amp; Tested By R29 Staffers</h1>

      <p>There's absolutely nothing wrong with <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/humidity-hair-products">frizz</a>, but if you want to try a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/hair-shine-products">sleek</a> and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/top-knot-hairstyle-tutorial-video">smooth</a> hairstyle those small, flyaway strands can be annoying.</p>
      <p>There are a handful of things that tend to cause <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/curly-hair-tips">frizz</a>, such as genetics and breakage as a result of heat damage from styling tools, but the most common factors at this time of year are rainy weather and winter humidity.</p>
      <p>The forecast looks wet for November, so in a bid to keep our hair in place, we tried 5 popular products, which claim to keep frizzy strands on lockdown.</p>
      <p>Here are the verdicts...</p>

      <p><b>Serena Brown, Creative Assistant</b><br/><b><br/>Product:</b> <b>Shea Moisture</b> Raw Shea &amp; Cupuacu Frizz Defense Gel Cream, £10.99, available at <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/shea-moisture-raw-shea-cupuacu-frizz-defense-gel-cream-249ml/11446317.html">Look Fantastic</a>.<br/><br/><b>Verdict:</b> It’s been a real emotional journey to get my hair into its current state. There have been many hours spent detangling and even more hours hunting the high street for a hair product that can define my curls without turning them into a stiff, crunchy mess. My current dream team is <a href="https://www.boots.com/boots-essentials-curl-creme-250ml-10088417">Boots Essentials Curl Creme, £1.99</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.boots.com/shea-moisture-jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-and-restore-leave-in-conditioner-10204097">Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strength &amp; Restore Leave-In Conditioner, £12.99</a>, so I was excited to try their Frizz Defense Gel Cream. <br/><br/>After detangling my hair in the shower I applied a small layer of my usual curl cream and used my fingers to rub the Shea Moisture cream through my locks. It was a much looser texture than I was used to and a bit more runny than my usual products which are good for keeping my hair hydrated and curls defined. After air-drying my hair throughout the day I was pretty impressed with the results, it definitely kept my hair frizz-free and my curls look great from a distance. Up close was another story, though. The product had left my hair a bit crunchy and static which is what I’ve been trying to avoid, especially when the weather is so damp and my hair doesn't always dry nicely. While I'll be sticking with my usual leave-in conditioner from Shea Moisture, the Frizz cream will still be a great addition to my hair care routine, just in smaller doses.</p>

      <p><b>Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Editor</b><br/><br/><b>Product: John Frieda</b> Frizz-Ease Extra Strength 6 Effects+ Serum, £6.99, available at <a href="https://www.boots.com/beauty/recommended/john-frieda-frizz-ease-extra-strength-6-effects-serum-50ml-10173984">Boots</a>.<br/><br/><b>Verdict:</b> My hair isn’t thick per se, but there’s a lot of it, and no matter how many hours I’ve spent blow-drying and straightening my waves to sleek, glossy perfection, they will always bounce straight back up as soon as I step foot outside. My hair gets especially frizzy in the rain even under the cover of an enormous umbrella. My ultimate gripe, though, is frizzy roots. Combined with inevitable breakage as a result of heated tools, not much I use works to keep those flyaways on lockdown apart from <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/kerastase-elixir-ultime-rose-hair-oil/11858064.html">Kerastase’s Elixir Ultime L’Huile Rose, £43</a>, which is at the higher end of my beauty budget, and <a href="https://www.hershesons.com/aec.html">Hershesons Almost Everything Cream, £10</a>, both of which I’d recommend.<br/><br/>This Frizz Ease option is £6.99, but it’s the Extra Strength label which swayed me. It supposedly eliminates frizz, protects against humidity, smooths and tames - and it really delivers. You can use it on wet hair, but I was in a rush and applied it to my dry hair before running out the door. It stuck down my frizzy roots without making them greasy and imparted a pretty amazing shine. I’m impressed, but I’d suggest using half of what you think you need as not to weigh hair down.</p>

      <p><b>Charlie Elliot, Strategy &amp; Client Services Associate Director</b> <br/><br/><b>Product tried:</b> <b>Virtue Labs</b> Polish Un-Frizz Cream, £38, available at <a href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/en_GB/haircare/hair-treatment/hair-treatment/polish-un-frizz-cream-MUK200023404.html">Space NK</a>.<br/><br/><b>Verdict:</b> My hair has been a lifelong source of confusion and frustration for me. I’m half Jamaican so it means I’m blessed with curls, but it’s so hard to find products on the market that isn’t for straight hair that’s then curled, or for C4 type. I just want something that gives me defined curls, calms frizz and gives volume without making my hair crispy. The Virtue Labs Polish Un-Frizz Cream looks super chic and smells divine. The consistency isn’t sticky and I combed it through wet hair with my fingers in replacement of my usual <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/sebastian-professional-potion-9-150ml/10544748.html">Sebastian Potion 9, £27.20</a>, or <a href="https://uk.lush.com/products/hair-styling/rb">LUSH RnB, £14</a>. <br/><br/>After blow drying with a diffuser, the sides and back of my hair had beautiful soft curls that I was so happy with, but my roots looked like I’d rubbed a balloon on the top of my head. I’ve played around with adding a bit of extra product post-blow dry which helps a bit, but I’m definitely not left frizz free <i>entirely</i>. Curl definition is definitely there so I think I’d keep this in my repertoire for special occasions where I have more time to use multiple products.</p>

      <p><b>Rose Lander, Marketing &amp; Events Executive</b><br/><b><br/>Product tried:</b> <b>Purology</b> Colour Fanatic Spray, £25.25, available at <a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/pureology-colour-fanatic-spray-200ml/11124912.html">Look Fantastic</a>.<br/><br/><b>Verdict: </b>My hair could be described at the best of times as confused. It’s perfectly possible for one side to be in a perfect wave while the other side is dead straight. I also often find my roots are greasy while the ends are frizzy and dry. I’m always dreaming of healthy, glossy, non-frizzy hair but if it looks vaguely like a hair-do I’m usually happy. <br/><br/>I’ve found keeping my hair long and colouring it once every six months helps to reduce frizz, which suits me as I am very lazy about my beauty routine, but does mean I need extra colour protection where it’s bleached. That’s why I was excited to try this spray. If it could protect my colour <i>and</i> keep away the frizz in one step, that would mean even less effort for me. (Did I mention I am very lazy?) Firstly I love the smell of this spray, which is a big deal for me as I find so many hair products either smell overly chemical or synthetic. Plus, it’s vegan. I also really like that you apply it when your hair is wet, as I feel like adding anything to my hair when it’s dry either weighs it down or makes it crispy. The only downside is as I blow-dry my hair, I felt like I was evaporating a lot of this spray as I dried it. I was pretty cautious about how much I used the first time, so I don’t think it had a massive effect immediately. Right after I blow dried my hair it still felt quite frizzy and not very smooth. However as my hair dried fully and settled down it definitely looked a bit straighter and more manageable than usual, and I loved smelling the residue of the spray throughout the day. I’ll definitely keep using this product and over time I think it will have a greater effect and protect my colour from fading. Going forward though, I need to use it more thoroughly and be a bit less lazy.</p>

      <p><b>Jazmin Kopotsha, Entertainment Editor</b><br/><b><br/>Product tried:</b> <b>Living Proof</b> Instant De-Frizzer, £25, available at <a href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/en_GB/haircare/styling/hairspray/instant-de-frizzer-MUK200021811.html">Space NK</a>.<br/><br/><b>Verdict:</b> I currently wear a great wig (human hair) <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/beyonce-hair-money-pieces">but since having it styled at the salon</a> I haven’t been able to recreate the same sleek and smooth finish; regardless of whether I straighten, curl, air dry or otherwise. I try not to go too heavy on products as not to weigh my hair down too much. I was curious about the Living Proof De-Frizzer, though, because it comes in a spray and I hoped it would also act like a dry shampoo and give me some volume at the roots <i>as well as</i> frizz-control. It did... for the most part. I got through the windiest weather by reapplying a few times throughout the day which kept most of my hair at bay but it’s a bit trickier to apply product to your ends (where I tend to frizz the most) with a spray. Bonus points for smell (quite fresh, not too potent) and not needing to put any product in my hands (I always end up wiping it on my jeans/eyes/computer mouse by mistake). It didn’t, however, leave all of my hair nice and soft to touch, which is what my usual serum (John Frieda Frizz Ease as tried by Beauty Editor Jackie) does.</p>
