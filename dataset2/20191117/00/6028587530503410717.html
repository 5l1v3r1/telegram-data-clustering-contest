      <p>Everyone dreads performance reviews, especially those tasked with reviewing others. That manager you are nervous to meet with is likely dreading the meeting more than you are. Can you make it easy, if not enjoyable, for them? Is this a pie in the sky idea? Not if you deploy the fundamental storytelling technique of strategically shifting your point of view. Shift your point of view, and you’ll notice the many biases that can plague managers. After all, reviewing a year’s worth of performance means battling a host of natural but detrimental tendencies, <a href="https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/10-performance-review-biases-and-how-to-avoid-them/">including</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Recency bias</b> (evaluating only the past month or two, rather than the full year).</li>
        <li><b>Leniency bias</b> (giving everyone high marks, regardless of whether it’s merited).</li>
        <li><b>Confirmation bias</b> (seeking <i>only</i> information that confirms the manager’s preconceived ideas about that person).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Awareness of common biases allows you to look through the glasses your manager is looking through and structure your review in a way that helps them notice your strengths. These three storytelling tips will help you highlight those strengths and use your performance review as fuel for further growth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Mine the past year for stories. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Take stock of your past year, digging deep into the caverns of your memory for stories. As you unearth stories, inspect them as if you are your manager. Doing your job and even doing it well is not worth noting. Use these questions to consider what you might have done that your manager didn’t expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are my biggest contributions to the company or team this year? What makes these contributions above and beyond my call of duty? What is it about these contributions that makes them so unexpected that my manager will want to reward me?</li>
        <li>What was the biggest investment I made this year (at work, in professional development, etc.)? How did this investment go above and beyond what my manager expected?</li>
        <li>What new leadership skills or industry insights have I learned this year? Did I share them with my team? If so, what difference has it made to them?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>2. Structure your stories.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You don’t have much time or space to tell a story, so structure is everything. The good news, though, is that by using the “IRS model,” you can craft a story with only three or four sentences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>I</b> - Intriguing beginning (first sentence or two)</li>
        <li><b>R</b> - Riveting middle (next sentence or two)</li>
        <li><b>S</b> - Satisfying end (final sentence or two)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A client of mine recently structured a brief story about herself with the opening line, “I am not who I appear to be.” Talk about an intriguing beginning! No one could shrug and walk away uninterested. Oddly enough, this story was inspired by <a href="https://www.leadershipstorylab.com/post/dreading-your-performance-review-storytelling-coaching-can-help">a quick passing remark my client made.</a> At first, she wasn’t convinced anyone would find her story meaningful. But when she tested it out on her mentor, it so impressed the mentor that she asked my client to teach her everything she knew about business storytelling. From that, my client was convinced she’d found a story worth retelling.</p>
      <p><b>3. Tell yourself the right story afterward.</b> </p>
      <p>What if you get difficult feedback? After performance reviews, over half of 1,500 U.S. workers surveyed said they were surprised by the results. Twenty-two percent cried, 37% looked for another job, and 20% flat-out quit, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adobe/full-study-performance-reviews-get-a-failing-grade/1">according to a study by Adobe</a>.</p>
      <p>When a manager’s feedback comes as a surprise, make sure you are<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/estherchoy/2018/10/02/stories-help-us-interpret-the-world-but-what-if-they-are-flawed/#2b4355f64d14"> telling yourself the right story</a> about the news you have received, especially if it is difficult. Verbalize that story, trying to see the feedback from your manager’s perspective. How were they trying to help you, and the company, grow? Once you can verbalize the story, try running it past someone you trust. Do they agree with your perspective? Can they add to what your manager might be thinking?</p>
      <p>For so much of the year, we are so busy “doing” that we don’t carve out time to reflect. The performance review forces us to reflect. We can welcome this chance to see our year in review—and to push our reflections even further by seeing our year through our manager’s eyes.</p>
