      <p>HONG KONG:Â Lee Cheuk-yiu gave his protest-wracked home city something to cheer on Saturday (Nov 16) as he upset India's Kidambi Srikanth to reach the Hong Kong Open badminton final.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who caused a stir earlier in the tournament by appearing to show support for the months-long pro-democracy protests, beat Srikanth 21-9, 25-23.</p>

      <p>Earlier, Thai former world champion Ratchanok Intanon overcame Japan's Akane Yamaguchi in three games to set up a women's singles final against Chen Yufei of China.</p>
      <p>The tournament is taking place against the backdrop of escalating protests that caused widespread disruption and violence across Hong Kong this week.</p>
      <p>Lee, world-ranked 27th, is now into the biggest final of his career after extending a dream run that includes victory over Denmark's Viktor Axelsen in the last eight.</p>
      <p>On Sunday he will play Anthony Ginting, who won an all-Indonesian clash 22-20, 13-21, 21-18 against Jonatan Christie.</p>
      <p>Lee made headlines after his opening match when he held up an outstretched right hand and his left index finger, in a gesture interpreted as supporting 'Five demands, not one less' -- a slogan chanted by the protesters.</p>
      <p>"Those who understand will understand, those who don't, just forget it," Lee said this week when asked to explain his celebration, according to the South China Morning Post.</p>
      <p>"We don't only show our determination on the badminton court, we can also show it in other aspects," he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier Ratchanok fought back from a game down to beat Yamaguchi 21-23, 21-15, 21-12 and set up a final with Chen, who appeared to be feeling the pace after her title run last week in Fuzhou.</p>
      <p>"She will be a bit tired from last week, and here also she looked tired. She has a good defence. I will try to do my best, I won't think about my weakness," Ratchanok said, according to the Badminton World Federation website.</p>
      <p>Chen laboured to a 21-18, 14-21, 21-15 win over Chinese-born American Zhang Beiwen, who spoke of her astonishment at the scenes she had witnessed in Hong Kong, where protesters blocked major routes and set fire to toll booths.</p>
      <p>"I have travelled on tour for many years and this is the most serious incident I have ever come across," said Zhang, according to the Post.</p>
      <p>"The fires were so terrible while the protesters in full gear look like those found in video games. It was quite scary."</p>
