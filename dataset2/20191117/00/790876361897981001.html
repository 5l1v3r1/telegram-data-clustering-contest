      <p>In many areas, autumn is the time of year when trees and other vegetation shed leaves. While the leaves will eventually decompose if left on the ground, you may want to speed up the process by breaking them down. Or, you may decide to collect the leaves and either recycle or dispose of them. However you decide to deal with your autumn leaves, you can make fall cleanup easier with a plan!</p>

            <p><b>1. Add landscaping near deciduous trees.</b> Make beds with plants that like natural mulch near the trees in your yard that shed leaves. When there are leaves on the ground, run them over once with a mower. Then rake them right into the beds.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

                    <p><b>2. Decide if you need to collect the leaves.</b> Several inches of leaf layer is natural and even an ecosystem. Wildlife like salamanders, turtles, chipmunks, and other species survive on such mini habitats.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Leaf litter also provides an overwintering shelter for beneficial insects and earthworms. However, if thick piles of leaves are smothering your lawn, you may want to break them down, if not collect them.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

                          <p><b>3. Rake pine needles first.</b> You may want to separate pine shedding from deciduous leaves. Pine needles are acidic, and there are certain plants that like acidic soil – and others that don’t. Therefore it’s beneficial to separate the pine needles to use as their own separate mulch.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

                                <p><b>4. Decide if you want to rake wet or dry leaves.</b> Wet leaves will form a more stable pile, but they are also heavier to rake.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Choose dry weather if you want to use a leaf vacuum, as wet leaves can clog the vacuum.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Don’t rake wet leaves if you have allergies, as mold and mildew in wet leaves can upset your sinuses.</p>

Consider keeping the brush pile there as a shelter for birds, chipmunks and other wildlife. You can also set sticks aside for use as fire kindling.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>

Rake the leaves.</b> Raking is ideal for small lawns and gardens.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Use quality <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Rake-Leaves">rakes</a>, preferably with soft grips. Rakes 36” or wider require more force, so choose a rake that is of standard width (24”). You can opt for ergonomic rakes, which have specially curved handles.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Don’t retrace your steps. Work from one side of the lawn to the other in a zigzag.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Deal-with-Autumn-Leaves#_note-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
