        <b>Defeating Roger Federer in the ATP Finals had Stefanos Tsitsipas acknowledging the scale of his achievement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas described himself as “living the dream” after knocking out Roger Federer to book an ATP Finals showpiece against Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>Greek star Tsitsipas ousted Federer 6-3 6-4 in the semi-final of the season-ending event to reach the biggest final of his career.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas has had an up-and-down year which started with a run to the last four of the Australian Open and was followed by a mid-season slump, but he appears to be keeping his best until last.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old saved 11 of Federer’s 12 break points on Saturday and explained beating the 20-time grand slam champion, who he watched winning major tournaments growing up, was difficult to comprehend.</p>
      <p>“I grew up watching Roger here at the ATP Finals and Wimbledon and other finals,” said Tsitsipas, who also beat Federer in the last 16 of the Australian Open.</p>
      <p>“I wished one day I could face him and now I’m here living the dream.</p>
      <p>“I remember myself being one of the kids here watching the event and I could never picture myself here. But it can happen.</p>
      <p>“This victory is probably one of my best moments of the season. These are the moments I live for.</p>
      <p>“This does feel, in a way, like a grand slam, because all eyes are here. Everyone knows this event. Everyone who watches tennis knows what the ATP Finals are.</p>
      <p>“For me, it’s a great new start, great new beginning to be here, playing in the Finals. It’s really very difficult to be in that position I am in right now and it counts a lot.”</p>

      <p>Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, was in attendance for the match and greeted Tsitsipas afterwards, highlighting the magnitude of his triumph.</p>
      <p>“I’m really glad I played well, stayed calm,” Tsitsipas said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great moment not just for me, for everyone else, my country, my team. I’m proud of myself, how hard I fought, how concentrated I stayed in the break points.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t crack under pressure. I was very composed and very mature in my decisions.”</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas and Thiem have met on six occasions over the last two years.</p>
      <p>Thiem won four of those, including the most recent clash last month, which was a three-set battle in the China Open final.</p>
