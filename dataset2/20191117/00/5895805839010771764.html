      </p>
      <p>Think about the last time you were involved in an important conversation, struggling to figure out what the other person was thinking. Whether you were faced with a partner unconvincingly claiming that everything is “fine,” to a boss critiquing your work, to a child reciting what they did after school before they came home two hours late.</p>
      <p>You had an advantage in any of those situations if you were face to face. This is because research reveals that when we actually take the time to have conversations in person, we can detect nonverbal expressions that corroborate or contradict the spoken word—if we know where to look.</p>

      <p>Harriet Overa and Richard Cook, in a piece entitled “Where do spontaneous first impressions of faces come from?” (2018), provide a novel account of the origin of first impressions from faces.[i] They list some of the traits we spontaneously attribute to strangers based solely on their face as including honesty, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intelligence">intelligence</a>, dominance, competence, trustworthiness, and likability. They identify the two primary trait dimensions we perceive as trustworthiness and dominance.</p>
      <p>Over and Cook note that facial cues that prompt observer judgments include permanent features that resemble emotions—such as low eyebrows, commonly associated with displays of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a>, which might prompt an inference of dominance. Yet they also explain the impact of other features such as facial symmetry, width, infantile features (which are often judged as trustworthy), and masculine features—another factor leading to perceived dominance when judging male faces.</p>
      <p>But are such observations always accurate? Other research notes the answer depends on where on another person´s face we look when we are searching for interpretive emotion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Revealing Emotion</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hedwig Eisenbarth and Georg W. Alpers in a piece entitled “Happy Mouth and Sad Eyes: Scanning Emotional Facial Expressions” (2011) reveals the importance of examining the parts of the face most likely to reveal emotion.[ii] Among their results was the finding that with all emotional expressions, subjects were likely to initially fixate on either the eyes or the mouth. Particularly when viewing sad facial expressions, they looked first at the eyes compared with all other expressions. When viewing happy facial expressions, participants spent more time fixating on the mouth region.</p>
      <p>They also found that when viewing sad and angry facial expressions, participants looked more at the eyes than the mouth. They explain that their results demonstrate that not all facial expressions are decoded equally, and that people look at areas of the face that are most characteristic for each emotion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Seeing is Believing</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the reasons facial emotional scanning is important is because not only do we quickly form impressions from the faces of strangers, our choices and behaviors are determined by what we see. Over and Cook note that spontaneous facial impressions impact behavior in everything from criminal sentencing decisions, to voting patterns, to employment decisions.</p>
      <p>How quickly do we read faces? Over and Cook note that adults make trait judgments after viewing faces for only 100ms. And regarding how early in our development we perform this analysis, they explain that children as young as 3 are able to perceive whether someone is “strong” or “nice,” and that children as young as 7 months prefer faces that are trustworthy rather than untrustworthy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Taking the Time to Look</b>
      </p>
      <p>The catch here is that in order to get an accurate read, we have to look. In a world where many people would rather talk than text, we miss opportunities to get to know each other much better then we can from misspelled words on a computer screen.</p>
      <p>By getting to know a person´s emotional baseline, and spending time with them in different settings and in different contexts, we are in a good position to emotionally read expressions and reactions that will reveal valuable information about character traits. Obviously, our assessments will not always be correct, because some people are good actors. But most people wear their emotional states on their sleeves more than they realize.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, spending time in person also facilitates <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment">bonding</a>, builds rapport, and gives your conversation partner an opportunity to read <i>you</i>.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by Frank on November 17, 2019 - 7:07pm</p>
      <p>Thank you for the blog post,. Dr. Patrick.</p>
      <p>Many years ago, I opened a complaint for sex discrimination against men at the company I was working for, back then. I had the good sense to open my complaint by email.</p>
      <p>Later one of the feminist sociopaths in Human Resources invited me to meet with them, and I (foolishly) accepted the invitation.</p>
      <p>What I noticed was that the sociopath wouldn't look me in the eye, but instead looked slightly below my eyes. I noticed that her eyes were rapidly darting from left to right continuously. My take was that she was not only ignoring me, but trying to think of a way to retaliate against the "uppity" man who had the temerity to complain about sex discrimination against men, She made some snotty comments, which included a threat to fire me for a disability. I complained to the CEO, but she of course, lied and denied that it happened.</p>
      <p>I went on to hire a lawyer and got a severance package, money in exchange for my resignation.</p>
      <p>Morals of the story: when you see beady, rapidly moving eyes, RUN away. And, NEVER meet with the slugs in HR in person: ONLY communicate by email.</p>
      <p>ESPECIALLY important information for men dealing with women that are hostile to men.</p>
