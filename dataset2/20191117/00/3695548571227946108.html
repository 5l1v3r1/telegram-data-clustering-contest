      <h1>Sainz's maiden F1 podium at Brazil secure after FIA review DRS use</h1>

        <b>Carlos Sainz Jr's first Formula 1 podium and McLaren's first in five years is secure, after the FIA looked into alleged illegal DRS use in the Brazilian Grand Prix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz inherited third place after Lewis Hamilton picked up a five-second penalty for hitting Alex Albon out of second on the penultimate lap of the race at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>While no formal investigation was announced, the FIA did request data from some teams - including McLaren - after complaints that DRS was used illegally under yellow flags during the grand prix.</p>
      <p>That meant further changes to the results were possible, but Sainz has now been awarded his third-place trophy.</p>
      <p>Sainz tweeted: "PODIUM! A bit weird not being there after the race, but still extremely happy.</p>
      <p>"Today's race was just unbelievable. The one-stop strategy was difficult but paid off.</p>
      <p>"Congrats to the whole team!"</p>
      <p>It is the Spaniard's first podium in 101 starts, and McLaren's first since the 2014 season-opening Australian Grand Prix - 119 races ago.</p>

      <p>Team principal Andreas Seidl told Autosport: "It's a great achievement obviously, I'm very happy for the entire team after putting in a lot of hard work here at the track and back home at the factory.</p>
      <p>"It's great to achieve this podium, the first one for Carlos in his career, also the first one for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>"It's great motivation to make sure we keep working hard and fight for podiums in the future down to our own performance."</p>
      <p>Sainz is seventh in the championship after a superb season in which he has previously earned a best result of fifth, three times, and he will end the year the best-placed driver who spent the full year in a midfield team.</p>
      <p>His breakthrough podium was all the more unlikely given he started the race last after failing to take part in qualifying because of an ignition wiring problem.</p>
      <p>As he was starting at the back anyway, McLaren gave him an all-new Renault engine for the grand prix.</p>
      <p>Seidl said: "We always go into the race with the spirit to never give up.</p>
      <p>"Of course we couldn't have dreamed of that result."</p>
