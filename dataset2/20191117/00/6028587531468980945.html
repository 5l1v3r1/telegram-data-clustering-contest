      <p><i>Jedi: Fallen Order</i> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/16/jedi-fallen-order-is-definitely-babys-first-dark-souls-but-in-a-good-way/#20e1c4702f1b">surprised players</a> when it revealed that Cal would be able to get his hands on a double-bladed lightsaber in the game, which some may consider a spoiler, but now EA has actually put it in many of the promotional spots for the game, so I think we’re past that at this point. And if you Googled this article, chances are you already know it exists, though I am going to refrain from sharing this on social media for those who aren’t looking for the answer, and may want to find it naturally.I stumbled upon the double-bladed lightsaber by accident, but in re-researching the exact place I found it, I realized there are actually <i>two</i> places to get it early, though I remain confused about if there’s a moment in the story where you’re “supposed” to get it later.</p>
      <p>There are two methods to get the double-bladed lightsaber early in the game, both at different points in the story.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DATHOMIR</b>
      </p>
      <p>Early on in the game, pretty much after the intro mission, you are told that you can go to one of two different planets, Zeffo or Dathomir. Your main objective tells you to go to Zeffo, the implication being that Dathomir is a nasty place you don’t really want to mess with, and I didn’t end up going there until the story forced me to pretty late in the game.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, if you brave Dathomir early, if you can reach a certainly point on the map, you can find the double-bladed lightsaber that way. You need to get through the first city area and then make your way to a place called Brother’s Bastion. This will trigger a cutscene with a mysterious cloaked figure, and this is sort of the end of how far you can go in Dathomir for now. However, in this area if you drop down and go to the left, there is a little workshop area that will unlock the potential for a dual lightsaber. Dathomir is going to be prettttty tough if you go there early, so you may want a different method.</p>

      <p>
        <b>BOGANO</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is how I found mine. At one point in the story, after you unlock your Force push, your crew will give you a hint that maybe you want to head back to Bogano, the starting planet with the temple, to see what you can find there. I said sure, why not, and headed back.</p>

      <p>To unlock the double-bladed lightsaber here, you need BD-1’s Scomp Link, which isn’t too far into the story, but you won’t be able to get it otherwise. There are a few ways to get here, you’re going back to the old workshop area that’s on the left side of the map from where you land. You can zipline down to the bottom and if you start climbing up, you will see a locked door that BD-1 has to hack to open with Scomp Link. There, you will be able to combine Cordova’s old lightsaber with your master’s, and create the double-bladed saber that way.</p>

        <b>THE CORRECT WAY?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am still trying to figure this out, but if you miss both of these, and it’s somewhat easy to, I think there’s a beat in the story later on where you’re “supposed” to get the double-bladed saber. Without getting too much into it, there was a significant moment in the main storyline that you can’t miss that I believe will have Cal getting a double-bladed saber even if you missed these other opportunities. But it’s near the end of the game, and I would not recommend waiting that long.</p>
      <p>The double-bladed saber is very, very good against groups of enemies as it can hit large clusters of them all at once. It’s also fantastic at deflecting blaster shots, as you can shoot back multiples at a time and clear an entire room. It is much worse against single targets and bosses, however, than the regular lightsaber. Eventually, you will unlock enough force powers where you will start getting double-blade specific skills. There aren’t many, but they are useful.</p>
      <p>Anyway, hope this helped.</p>
