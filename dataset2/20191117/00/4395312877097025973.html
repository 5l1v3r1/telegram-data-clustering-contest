      <p>Emails, notifications and, of course, the urge to scroll, scroll and scroll some more. Our phones are a huge source of distraction that not only leads to stress and anxiety, but also takes us away from focusing on what truly matters – being mindful and building relationships with those right in front of us.</p>
      <p>No matter their downsides, phones are here to stay, so rather than giving into their evil ways, we need to harness the power of technology for good. There are so many ways phones can improve our lives.</p>
      <p>Research shows that incorporating positive <a href="https://www.thebrimfullife.com/be-a-stronger-leader-with-positive-psychology/">psychology practices </a>such as mindfulness, gratitude and appreciation into our daily lives leads to increased self-esteem, improved relationships, and overall positivity. This leads to people having greater focus, improved decision-making and more creative thinking. </p>
      <p>By using your phone to incorporate positive psychology practices, you can create routines to improve your habits and boost productivity. </p>

        <b>5 Happy Phone Habits a Day </b>
      </p>
      <p>Here are five easy ways to use your phone for good, not evil:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mindfulness</b> – Focusing your thoughts to be present in the moment rather than worrying about the past or the future will help anxiety and reduce stress. Try adding 15 minutes to your calendar each day for the upcoming week to practice mindfulness. Phone apps like Calm or Headspace can help guide you.</li>
        <li><b>Practice gratitude</b> – Being thankful and showing it are key to higher self-esteem and empathy for yourself and others. Email yourself what you’re grateful for to read when you get to work or keep a gratitude list on your phone in your notes app to reference daily.</li>
        <li><b>Invest in relationships</b> – A sense of belonging with others helps bring meaning to life. Take just a few minutes out of each day to text three friends or colleagues to let them know you are thinking of them and wishing them well.</li>
        <li><b>Invest in experiences</b> – We’re all busy, but making time to spend with friends helps keep us connected with one another – something you can’t get through connecting on social media. Text or call one friend you haven’t seen in a while to set up a coffee date, or invite them to a regular get-together through your calendar app!</li>
        <li><b>Focus on your strengths</b> – Everyone performs better when they zero in on their strengths rather than their weaknesses. Email yourself one strength and one idea for how to use it during the day to read when you get to work. Set a reminder in your phone to do this!</li>
      </ul>
