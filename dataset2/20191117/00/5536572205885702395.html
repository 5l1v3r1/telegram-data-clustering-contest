      <h1>Kobe Bryant’s Daughter Dribbles Into Triple-Team &amp; Shoots Perfect Fadeaway Just Like Her Father (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Kobe Bryant is a proud father, and he shows that off by being a very active dad in his kid’s life as he continues to transition from his life in the National Basketball Association.</p>
      <p>The former Lakers legend posted a new video this week showing his 13-year old daughter Gigi playing basketball, and she pulled off a move we’ve seen her dad do hundreds of times during his career.</p>
      <p>GiGi received the in-bounds pass, dribbled up the court as she took it to the baseline and shot a fadeaway over multiple defenders.</p>
      <p>Not a pass in sight.</p>
