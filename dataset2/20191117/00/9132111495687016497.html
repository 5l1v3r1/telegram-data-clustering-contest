      <p>History was made in Dusseldorf, Germany on Friday, 15th November 2019 when the NDC Party School (Ghana Institute of Social Democracy) led discussions towards the formation of the first union of Leftist Political Party Schools in Africa, the African Left Party Schools Union – ALPSU</p>
      <p>The African Left Party Schools Union is aimed at promoting the intensification and pluralization of Leftist political education in Africa.</p>
      <p>The Union was given life upon the signing of the ‘Dusseldorf Declaration’ on the sidelines of the FES African Party Schools Study Conference held in Berlin and Dusseldorf in Germany.</p>
      <p>The decision was driven by the need to exchange knowledge and experiences in our collective effort to expand political education in order to reawaken the consciousness of the masses in the pursuit of Leftism, as a vehicle to accelerate the advancement of economic growth, freedom, democracy and the collective welfare of the African people.</p>
      <p>Ghana was selected to host the Secretariat ahead of the conduct of the Maiden African Party Schools Conference to be held in South Africa on 23rd - 25th September 2020.</p>
      <p>Comrade Dr. William Ahadzie, the Rector of NDC Party School was selected as the Chairman and Comrade Dr. Peter Boamah Otokunor, a Deputy General Secretary of NDC as the Secretary-General of the interim executive committee of the union.</p>
      <p>The secretariat is tasked to lead the preparation of a Statute and the initial Mobilisation effort of Union to bring on board all other Leftist Party Schools in Africa, ahead of the 2020 Conference in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Principal of the OR Tambo School of Leadership (ANC Party School) who doubles as a Deputy Minister of Finance of South Africa, Comrade Dr. David Masondo was selected as the Head of Finance and Logistics of the Union and the Chief Operating Officer of the OR Tambo School of Leadership, Ms. Lorraine Hlapolosa was nominated to Chair the Local Organising Committee comprising of Mr. Gulamo Taju, Director of the FRELIMO Central Party School and Dr. Bendita Lopez also of the FRELIMO Central Party School in Mozambique.</p>
