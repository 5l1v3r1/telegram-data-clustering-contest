        <b>World Cup runners-up Croatia rounded off a rebuilding mission by booking their place at Euro 2020 with a 3-1 win over Slovakia but they are unlikely to sneak under the radar again at next year's finals. Â </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Croatia secured top spot in Group E</b>, a section also including Hungary, Wales and Azerbaijan, with<b> five wins and two draws</b> from their eight qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Coach <b>Zlatko Dalic,</b> who masterminded the run to last year's World Cup final, has<b> gradually reconstructed a squad </b>that lost<b> Mario Mandzukic, Danijel Subasic and Vedran Corluka</b> to retirement in the wake of the 4-2 loss to France in Russia. </p>
      <p>The "Vatreni" -- Croatian for "Fiery Ones" -- needed only a point in Rijeka on Saturday to<b> ensure a spot at the 24-team event</b>, which kicks off in Rome on June 12.</p>
      <p>After a shocking start for home fans when<b> Robert Bozenik </b>scored in the 32th minute, Croatia's qualification was never in doubt once<b> Nikola Vlasic </b>drilled home the leveller in the second half.</p>
      <p><b>Bruno Petkovic </b>headed the hosts in front and Ivan Perisic sealed the three points with <b>a thumping finish with 16 minutes left.</b></p>
      <p><b>"I'm relieved ... proud and happy</b>," Dalic said after the match.</p>
      <p>"These boys deserved the European Championship. This is<b> the crowning moment for all that we have done</b> in this year and a half since the World Cup."</p>
      <p>
        <b>- 'Dark horses' no more -</b>
      </p>
      <p>But the path through qualifying, preceded by a poor showing in the Nations League, where Croatia finished last in their group behind Spain and England, was far from plain sailing.</p>
      <p>Thumped 6-0 by Spain in their first competitive outing since the World Cup, Dalic spoke of<b> the need for "fresh blood"</b> to rejuvenate his side.</p>

      <p>Incorporating the likes of Petkovic, Josip Brekalo and Vlasic, Croatia began their qualifying bid with <b>a difficult 2-1 victory against Azerbaijan</b> at home in March.</p>
      <p>They<b> slumped to a defeat by the same scoreline away to Hungary </b>days later, but victory over Wales in June and a 4-0 win away to Slovakia<b> rebuilt fragile confidence.</b></p>
      <p>A disappointing 1-1 draw in Azerbaijan was a setback but Croatia recovered to dismiss Hungary 3-0, before a point in Cardiff left them<b> on the brink of qualification.</b></p>
      <p>For the former Yugoslav republic, independent since 1991,<b> it is the sixth time he will play at the European Championship.</b></p>
      <p><b>"We are getting young players who today played like veterans.</b> Vlasic and (Dino) Peric played superbly," Dalic said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Croatian papers Sunday echoed his view, praising the squad and Dalic who became just<b> the second coach to take the country to two successive major tournaments.</b></p>
      <p>The legendary Miroslav Ciro Blazevic was the first, leading Croatia to the<b> Euro '96 quarter-finals and a third-place finish at the 1998 World Cup</b> in France.</p>
      <p>The nation of 4.2 million people reached <b>the World Cup final last year for the first time</b>, inspired by captain<b> Luka Modric,</b> but eventually fell to a heavily fancied France.</p>
      <p><b>"In a bit more than a year Croatia formed an excellent 'make up'</b> and that is why we are looking forward to the European tournament," the Sportske Novosti daily commented Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Croatia will not be a 'dark horse' in summer 2020 but<b> will be rather attacking from the front rows</b>, which is both an advantage and a burden."</p>
