      <h1>This Might Be The No. 1 Reason Why European Politicians Are So Hyped Up On Climate Change</h1>

      <p>Talk to a European fund manager, almost any of them, and they will say climate change as a great disruptor for global business. They’re all in.It’s not that they are convinced the planet will be uninhabitable, with large coastal zones under water by 2022 and the Amazon nothing but burnt timber. It’s because the Earth’s evolving climate is creating new opportunities for businesses to build machines that are helping to clean up environmental toxins, or reduce carbon footprints caused from burning fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>“There’s been a sea change in attitudes regarding climate change as a global investment risk. If you’re not aware of the dynamics at play, you’re at a much greater risk of losing money,” says Charles Prideaux, global product head of Schroders in London.</p>
      <p>That risk includes things like oil or coal companies at risk of being banned by politicians from doing business in some states or even countries as governments move to hyper-clean alternatives. That’s bad for the oil and gas company, good for the solar turbine manufacturer, a growing number of which are in China.</p>

      <p>It’s a $2 trillion opportunity in climate solutions that Prideaux estimates will be needed as government’s push for cleaner energy.</p>
      <p>We know why the market likes it. It’s not as much about altruism as it is being a good fiduciary – protecting assets. No one wants to be overweight sectors of the economy where governments aren’t inventing new ways to pull the rug out and regulate because it scores points with an electorate concerned about climate change.</p>
      <p>Here is why politicians can’t get enough global warming.</p>
      <p>They love it because it is well on its way to becoming an overpowering get-out-the-vote issue. It’s bigger than jobs and the economy for Europeans, according to the recent Eurobarometer Survey. It’s now gaining on immigration, the biggest wedge issue in the EU and arguably the leading issue behind Brexit.</p>

        <figcaption>Immigration overpowered the economy as the most important issue facing voters in Europe in the ... [+] summer of 2014. Immigration and terrorism has been top of mind since. But wait...here comes a future risk that's gaining on the migrant debate.<cite>Schroders</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Unlike the economy, unemployment and terrorism, climate change is less tangible. Unless Mother Nature is raging wildfires in your neighborhood, or flooding the streets of Venice, there is nothing tangible about climate change. For most people, climate change only exists once or twice a year, with most of it existing only on TV. Climate change doesn’t compete with having a job and security.</p>
      <p>But it does now!</p>
      <p>Every time there is a weather-related disaster, or a larger than normal wildfire, politicians are bringing up the climate crisis. Just as politicians always bring up gun control after every shooting in a public setting, they are now bringing up the climate crisis every time it’s too hot, or too cold. It’s registering, at least in Europe.</p>
      <p>Climate change became top of mind in Europe since mid-summer, trailing second to immigration. At this rate, the climate issue is the best way for European politicians, especially those who have been lambasted for their weak immigration policies, to get the electorate back on their side.</p>
      <p>From a macro perspective, the immigration debate divides Europe. But the climate debate might unify them, if it takes over immigration in Eurobarometer surveys in the years ahead.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the market is already there. It has turned this latest hot-button issue into a new way to make money.</p>
      <p>Europe has their roughly $90 billion green bond market now. And the European Central Bank (ECB) is buying. The question is whether the ECB will increase the pace of this green bond buying program under new director Christine Lagarde. That would mean the ECB is following the zeitgeist of EU politics. <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/focus/2018/html/ecb.ebbox201807_01.en.html">Their official stance is that they are only supporting EU directives.</a></p>
      <p>“The green bond market, and we are most definitely involved in it, is rapidly emerging in line with the push towards climate change,” says Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist for Nordea Asset Management, one of northern Europe’s largest asset managers.</p>

        <b>Green Bond Market To EU Politicians: Keep Talking!</b>

      <p>The appetite from retail and professional investors is increasing right along with global temperatures.</p>
      <p>Last year was the hottest year on record. Last year was so hot that global land and ocean surface temperatures were 1.42 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th-century average, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Since 1880, when record-keeping began, 2015, 2016 and 2017 were hotter than last year.</p>
      <p>The market seems willing to bet that governments will continue to hop on the fossil fuel industry, opening up doors to alternatives and new products designed to capture carbon in the atmosphere. For this reason, they’re getting in ahead of what some see as a wall of money moving into this sub-asset class.</p>
      <p>As it is, companies that want to attract deep pocketed investors who have now become environmentally “woke”, they’ll have to get green or big investors might tell them to get lost.</p>
      <p>The ECB’s hitting the green button is a sign to the market that politicians are going to hammer away on this issue for years, meaning more regulations against polluters and fossil fuels.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Buying green is also a nice way for the ECB to expand its balance sheet to include environmentally friendly corporate debt instead of just sovereign debt.</p>
      <p>How does all this work in practice?</p>
      <p>“A German wind turbine operator would come to Societe Generale (for a loan). They would run the models to propose a financing package. They can issue a standard bond, or a Green label one,” says Galy. The green one is better. It captures the ECB’s interest along with a growing list of funds that are getting all vegan in their market views. (Yes, even cows are bad to some of these guys.)</p>
      <p>Swedes, the most woke capitalists around and home to world famous climate activist Greta Thunberg, has some of its central bank snubbing climate crises ne’er-do-wells. The Swedish Riksbank<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/076e9978-06c2-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca"> gave up on buying Canadian and Australian bonds</a> recently because it wouldn’t be environmentally prudent.</p>
