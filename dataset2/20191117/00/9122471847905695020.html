      <p>On Saturday afternoon, No. 12 Auburn hosted No. 4 Georgia in a huge SEC showdown with College Football Playoff implications.</p>
      <p>After a slow start for both offenses, Georgia finally got the ball rolling. The Bulldogs took a 21-0 lead into the fourth quarter and looked to be running away with the game.</p>
      <p>However, the Tigers stormed back in the fourth quarter. After scoring a touchdown to cut Georgia’s lead to 21-7, the Tigers used a surprise onside kick to get the ball back.</p>
      <p>Auburn went on to score another touchdown and cut Georgia’s lead to just seven points with over seven minutes left.</p>
      <p>The Tigers’ comeback attempt came up empty in the end, though as Georgia stopped Auburn on a long fourth down attempt and ran the clock out.</p>
      <p>After the game, Georgia head coach Kirby Smart tried to celebrate with one of his players, but it didn’t go too well. Smart played college ball back in the day, but he’s no match for defensive lineman Travon Walker.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>Walker comes in at nearly 300 pounds, so we won’t take too much away from Smart here.</p>
      <p>In the end, Georgia moved to 9-1 with the win and kept its College Football Playoff hopes alive. Can the Bulldogs keep it rolling?</p>
