      <p>A <a href="http://blog.indeed.com/2019/10/30/career-change/">survey</a> of almost 700 workers by job posting site, <a href="http://blog.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>, found that there are a significant number of career changers or aspiring career changers. Almost half of survey respondents (49%) had already changed roles (e.g., teaching to finance, marketing to engineering), and of the respondents who hadn’t made a career change, almost two-thirds (65%) said they are considering or have considered making a change. Career change is not a decision made lightly. 11 months was the average amount of time spent planning.</p>
      <p>The top five reasons for making a career change include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Unhappy in previous role – 81%</li>
        <li>Wanted greater flexibility – 79%</li>
        <li>Wanted to earn more money – 79%</li>
        <li>Did not feel challenged or satisfied – 78%</li>
        <li>Wanted more opportunities for advancement - 77%</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Having <a href="https://costaricafire.com/career/career-change-after-40-costa-rica/">changed careers myself</a>, I know firsthand how disruptive it can be. Having coached many clients on their own career change, I also know how time-consuming it can be. However, 11 months (almost a full year!) is a long time to be unhappy and wishing for something else. Thinking that a career change needs to take that long might discourage you from even getting started.</p>
      <p>More importantly, career change itself is not the end goal. The end goal is happiness, flexibility, more money, etc. Changing careers may or may not get you to your goal. Instead of focusing on a career change that could take almost a year and then maybe reach your goal, focus on the goal directly and tackle it first. You will likely reach your goal sooner.</p>

        <b>Find happiness outside of your job</b>
      </p>
      <p>I once had a client who was so unhappy at his job that he wouldn’t have been able to launch an effective career change. His negative demeanor would not have attracted the right opportunities. His frustration on the job would have made the inevitable frustrations of a job search too much to handle. Yet, he needed to stay in that job as he didn’t have other means of support or savings to last a protracted career change. Instead of focusing on his career change, we focused on his happiness: what was one small thing he could add to his day-to-day that would bring him enough happiness that his demeanor would change, his energy would change and therefore his capacity to make other changes, like a career change, would increase? For this client, it was watching the classic movies he always intended to see but never made time for.</p>

        <b>Negotiate for flexibility where you are</b>
      </p>
      <p>Any time you change jobs, there is ramp up time that makes your schedule less, not more, flexible. You need to learn how that employer gets things done. You need to meet people and understand who does what. You need to build your credibility. Sure, some industries, companies and roles are more flexible than others, so changing careers can help, but it’s a long-term investment on your part and will take time to pay off. Instead of assuming flexibility is something out there, find ways to incorporate more flexibility in your current schedule. If you’re going to quit anyway, you might as well negotiate hard and get some practice <a href="https://costaricafire.com/career/indispensability-key-trait-for-flexibility-at-work/">negotiating for flexibility</a> with your current employer.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Whether it’s working from home, changing up your start or end times or having more autonomy over how or when you get your work done, how can you build more flexibility into your existing job?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Renegotiate your compensation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Negotiating for flexibility will give you some useful practice and hard-won skills and so will renegotiating your compensation. One of my clients thought he was topped out in his job so went looking elsewhere. He was upfront with his boss, whom he considered a mentor and supporter, about his desire for more. He got another offer but ultimately decided to stay, and his boss found a way to restructure his responsibilities and get him a 20% raise. This wasn’t a counteroffer to make him stay – he had already decided to stay, and the company renegotiated his compensation anyway. It’s a myth that the only time your compensation changes is when you change jobs, switch departments or get promoted. Roles change over time, and any change in what you do or how important your responsibilities are to the company is a potential opening for renegotiating compensation.</p>
      <p>
        <i>What more can you ask for in your existing role? Think beyond salary to include bonus, profit-sharing or perks, such as professional memberships or other expenses covered.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Challenge yourself</b>
      </p>
      <p>Changing careers is not the only way to challenge yourself professionally. I have had clients take leadership roles in professional associations, Board seats for causes they care about or advisory roles for start-ups. These roles are challenging and yield significant professional benefits to your network, your brand and your future career prospects. When you change careers, you’ll need time to get up to speed in your new domain. Instead, take full advantage of the credibility and expertise you have already built up in your existing domain to raise your profile outside your company.</p>
      <p>
        <i>How can you step up in your industry and your community? If a leadership role seems too much of a stretch, teaching or mentoring are interim steps you can take right away.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Create your own career opportunities</b>
      </p>
      <p>Your best prospects for advancement should be at the company where you are because they know you and your work. Before you leave for greener pastures, make an honest assessment about why you’re not getting promoted right where you are. Maybe you’re at a small company or family business with limited upward mobility. Maybe you’re already just one level below where you want to be and your boss isn’t going anywhere. Maybe you’re no longer interested in the field you’re in. You may ultimately have to leave, but in the meantime, get 360-feedback on how you’re doing, work with an executive coach on your <a href="https://www.sixfigurestart.com/career-management/executive-presence-checklist-ten-factors-recruiters-assess/">presence</a> and <a href="https://www.sixfigurestart.com/career-management/get-picked-leadership-strategies-get-noticed-next-big-promotion/">potential</a>, identify influencers and supporters in your network who can help you.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Lack of advancement may be about lack of opportunity or lack of something else. How can you develop yourself for the next level?</i>
      </p>

        <b>Going after the end goal rather than the new career will help the career change happen sooner</b>
      </p>
      <p>Focusing on how you can get your end goal, without the career change first, can help the career change happen sooner. As you develop professionally, strengthen your brand, expand your network and take better care of yourself, you become a more competitive candidate. You become more resilient and able to handle the inevitable ups and downs of changing careers. You attract better opportunities. Your career change might still take 11 months or even longer, but in the meantime, you’re making improvements in your life and career right now.</p>
