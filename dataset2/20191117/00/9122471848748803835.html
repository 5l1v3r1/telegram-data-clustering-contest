      <h1>Video Of Auburn Fans’ Reaction To Missed 4th Down Pass Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:44:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Time just ran out on the Auburn Tigers. After struggling with Georgia’s impressive defense early, Auburn clawed back into the game in the fourth quarter, cutting a 21-0 lead down to one touchdown.</p>
      <p>The Tigers won’t be able to complete the job, though. Bo Nix and the offense had its best shot with the ball in UGA territory with just over two minutes left.</p>
      <p>Auburn went for it on 4th-and-2 from the Georgia 34 yard line with 2:24 remaining in the game. Unfortunately for the War Eagle faithful at Jordan-Hare Stadium, Nix’s attempt to Harold Joyner fell incomplete.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for those of us neutral fans at home, the reactions from those Auburn fans were <i>incredible</i>.</p>
      <p>CBS Sports posted a quick video from the stands, which featured a distressed orange-suited fan, next to a dapper-looking Aubie, cutting to a girl doing a full Darth Vader in <i>Revenge of the Sith </i>dramatic “NO” yell.</p>

      <p>Auburn did get another chance after this play. After forcing a three-and-out, the Tigers got the ball back at their own 27-yard line with just under two minutes left. Nix went 0-for-3, and was sacked on 4th-and-10 by Travon Walker for a five-yard loss, to give Georgia the ball back and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=401110849">seal the win</a>.</p>
      <p>With the win, Georgia clinches the SEC East title. They are likely set to face LSU in the title game, with the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">College Football Playoff on the line</a>.</p>
      <p>Auburn has a really good defense, and has had some nice moments with a true freshman quarterback, but as always, there is some uncertainty surrounding Gus Malzahn, a situation he finds himself in every few years. Beating a Tua Tagovailoa-less Alabama would certainly help matters, but tonight would have set the stage for a very impressive end of the season for AU.</p>
