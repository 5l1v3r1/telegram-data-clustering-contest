      <p>Dublin's Siobhán McGrath was named as the 2019 TG4 Senior Players’ Player of the Year at the annual All Star banquet, in association with Lidl, at the Citywest Hotel on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>McGrath was superb throughout the season as the Sky Blues went on to claim a third successive TG4 All-Ireland Senior Championship title in front of a record 56,114 attendance at Croke Park on September 15.</p>
      <p>Thomas Davis star McGrath (31), also claimed a fourth TG4 All Star award on the night, following on from previous successes in 2009, 2010 and 2018.</p>
      <p>McGrath was the popular choice of her peers to claim the TG4 Senior Players’ Player of the Year award, beating off stiff competition from Dublin team-mate Sinéad Goldrick and Galway’s Louise Ward, who also won All Stars on the night.</p>
      <p>It’s the third successive year that a Dublin player has won the TG4 Senior Players’ Player of the Year award, following wins for Noelle Healy in 2017 and captain Sinéad Aherne in 2018.</p>

      <p>The 2019 TG4 Intermediate Players’ Player of the Year award went to Tipperary’s Aishling Moloney.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Cahir star was named as Player of the Match in the TG4 All-Ireland Intermediate Final as Tipperary lifted the Mary Quinn Memorial Cup for the second time in three years.</p>
      <p>It’s also the second time in three seasons that a Tipperary player has been named TG4 Intermediate Players’ Player of the Year, following success for Aisling McCarthy in 2017.</p>
      <p>Moloney earned the nod in the Intermediate grade ahead of team-mate Orla O’Dwyer, and 2019 TG4 All Star goalkeeper Monica McGuirk from Meath.</p>
      <p>And while Fermanagh may have lost the TG4 All-Ireland Junior Final against Louth at Croke Park, 18-year-old Eimear Smyth was voted by her peers as the TG4 Junior Players’ Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>Smyth was nominated alongside Louth’s TG4 All-Ireland winning captain Kate Flood, who was TG4 Junior Players’ Player of the Year in 2015 and 2018, and London’s Hannah Noonan.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the evening, Mayo legend Christina Heffernan was officially inducted into the Ladies Gaelic Football Association (LGFA) Hall of Fame, while Ellen Power (Galway/Connacht), Ciara Smyth (Meath/Leinster), Eimear O’Donovan (Cork/Munster) and Saoirse Kiernan (Cavan/Ulster) collected the provincial Young Player of the Year awards.</p>
