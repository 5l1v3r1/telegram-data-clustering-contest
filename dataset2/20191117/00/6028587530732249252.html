      <p>San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan made it more than clear following <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/12/nfl-week-10-takeaways-from-49ers-overtime-loss-to-the-seahawks/">Monday night’s overtime loss to the Seattle Seahawks</a> that he’s not happy with the team’s wide receiver group. Once Emmanuel Sanders went down, other receivers on the 49ers’ roster struggled big time. Big drops from Dante Pettis and Kendrick Bourne pretty much cost the team this game.</p>
      <p>Shanahan was having none of it after the fact.</p>
      <p>“The more he (Pettis) doesn’t take advantage of his opportunities, the less opportunities he gets,” Shanahan had on Tuesday. “He did get a couple last night because of injury and I didn’t think he made them. We’ll see how this week goes. Dante has the ability, but we’re waiting for him to pick it up and have the consistency and take advantage of some of these opportunities he’s gotten.”</p>
      <p>The second-year receiver dropped multiple passes Monday night, each of which would have gone for first downs. Pettis has now hauled in just 11-of-21 targets for a 45.8% catch rate as a sophomore. He’s among the worst qualified receivers in the NFL heading into Week 11.</p>
      <p>Bourne had been a bit better with the drops up until Monday evening. However, his initial drop of the game resulted directly in an interception and touchdown for the Seahawks’ defense.</p>
      <p>Bourne’s last drop came with San Francisco driving for a potential win in the fourth quarter. Instead, the team had to settle for a field goal in a game that went to overtime.</p>
      <p>“It’s not OK. Those are two very big drops that Bourne had. That doesn’t mean that we’re not going to keep going to him. He’s a guy who can catch the ball,” Shanahan continued. “He’s made a lot of big catches for us. He made two big catches in that game leading up to that point, but that was a huge change.”</p>
      <p>All said, the 49ers dropped nine Garoppolo pass attempts in a game that saw him complete 24-of-46 passes. That means 41% of Garoppolo’s incompletions came on drops.</p>

      <p>At 8-1 on the season, San Francisco can’t have a weak link at this level. The team obviously has Super Bowl aspirations. Even with Sanders’ injury being deemed minor and Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle set to return from injury here soon, this weak link could cost the team a Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>Heck, we may look back following Week 17 at Monday night and conclude that these drops cost San Francisco both the NFC West title and home-field advantage in the NFC Playoffs.</p>
      <p>This isn’t to excuse away Garoppolo’s issues from Monday night. While his interception was clearly on Bourne, the quarterback lost two fumbles (both resulting in short fields and touchdowns for Seattle).</p>
      <p>However, he’s not being helped out at all be these young receivers. It’s now time San Francisco goes to the free-agent market and at least checks in on what former Pro Bowler Dez Bryant can bring to the table.</p>
      <p>Having not played since 2017, the 31-year-old Bryant is about a calendar year removed from suffering a torn Achilles in his first practice as a member of the New Orleans Saints. He just recently took to social media indicating that he’s <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/2019/11/dez-bryant-plans-to-reach-out-to-teams-this-month/">prepared to reach out to teams here in the near future</a>.</p>
      <p>Boasting a better track record than any current 49ers receiver, Emmanuel Sanders included, Bryant would be a low-risk, high-reward option. He’s not going to be demanding anything more than a one-year deal and the former Pro Bowler’s asking price would fit under the 49ers’ restrictive cap room.</p>
      <p>Here’s a guy that averaged 70 receptions for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns from 2012-16. He’s different than every 49ers receiver outside of Jalen Hurd in that Bryant stands at 6-foot-2. Even if he has lost a step, Bryant could provide that consistent receiving threat on the outside for Garoppolo. Even with Sanders aboard, that’s something the quarterback has been missing. Remember, Sanders has been playing more in the slot with San Francisco.</p>
      <p>In the end, this is not about signing Bryant. It’s all about seeing what the receiver might have left in the tank during a workout. What’s the harm in that? Absolutely nothing!</p>
      <p>If the 49ers’ receivers struggle catching passes on Sunday in a losing effort to Arizona, it would not be a surprise if we heard about a Tuesday workout for veteran receivers. Bryant should sit atop that list.</p>
