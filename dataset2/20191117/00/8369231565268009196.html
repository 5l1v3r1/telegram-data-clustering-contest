      <h1>We've Found a Serious New Health Risk to Human Spaceflight</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-just-announced-more-strange-results-from-its-ambitious-twin-study">We're still learning</a> about the potential effect that extended periods spent in space could have on the human body. Now a new health threat has been identified, one which could put lives at risk on long journeys through the cosmos.</p>
      <p>The problem lies in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_jugular_vein">internal jugular vein</a> (IJV), a major blood vessel running down the neck from the brain. A study of 11 astronauts who spent time on the International Space Station (ISS) found that six of them had developed stagnant or backwards blood flow in this particular vein, within a period of just 50 days.</p>
      <p>One crew member was found to have developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis">thrombosis</a>, or blockage in the internal jugular vein, the first time that this has been recorded as a result of spaceflight.</p>
      <p>According to the team behind the new findings, this issue needs to be investigated before we start sending astronauts on <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-s-new-mars-probe-insight-is-about-to-land-here-s-how-to-watch?fbclid=IwAR0Dzt5D7Q6_Ra4XoOBzN3furyzX6tRY2fo9ilFgZITpy4yFjuxdhCbBmW8">long trips to Mars</a>. It's not yet clear just what the consequences of this kind of thrombosis might be, but the implications could be severe and perhaps even fatal.</p>
      <p>"Exposure to a weightless environment during spaceflight results in a chronic headward blood and tissue fluid shift compared with the upright posture on Earth, with unknown consequences to cerebral venous outflow," write the researchers in their <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755307">published paper</a>.</p>
      <p>Down here on Earth of course, gravity takes care of the job of pulling blood down from the head to the rest of the body – it's one of the reasons you'd start feeling very strange if you stood on your hands for an extended period of time.</p>
      <p>Up in the microgravity environment of the ISS, it's a different story – and bloodflow issues aren't the only health risks we need to worry about.</p>
      <p>"Headward fluid shifts during prolonged weightlessness result in facial puffiness, decreased leg volume, increased stroke volume, and decreased plasma volume," <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755307">write the researchers</a>.</p>
      <p>Medical experts used readings and images gathered on board the ISS to identify the potential issue with the IJV, while the astronaut who developed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus">occlusive thrombus</a> was treated with anticoagulants for the remainder of the mission (the identities of the astronauts are being kept back for privacy reasons).</p>
      <p>More research is needed to work out how big of a problem this actually is, and how we might mitigate against it in future spaceflights; but the high number of astronauts who developed some kind of blood flow issue is worrying.</p>
      <p>We already know that time in space can <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-s-twin-study-shows-us-the-hazards-of-long-term-spaceflight">reduce bone density</a>, change the make-up of our gut bacteria, and put <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-structures-change-size-long-term-space-travel-2017">a squeeze on our brains</a>. At least we're working to discover these effects before we try to get farther than the Moon, so there's a better chance of developing potential solutions.</p>
      <p>"[These] are novel findings that may have significant human health implications for civilian spaceflight as well as future exploration-class missions, such as a mission to Mars," <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755307">conclude the researchers</a>.</p>
      <p>The research has been published in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2755307"><i>JAMA Network Open</i></a>.</p>
