        <b>Former Atletico Madrid player, Rodrigo Hernandez, who currently plays for Manchester City, did an interview with 'Marca'. He returned to the Metropolitano to play with Spain, against Romania. The midfielder wanted to say something to the Atletico fans.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"I have very good memories of my year at Atletico. </b>I gave it my all. I don't think anyone, especially the fans, like players to leave, but one day you're in one place and the next day you're at another," Rodri analysed. </p>
      <p>He hopes and wishes that one day the fans remember the good times that they had together, <b>"I want the people  to remember that I gave it my all," he said.</b></p>
      <p><b>City's offer seduced him </b>and he could not say no. "I do not know if Guardiola was decisive in my decision to go to City.<b> I think it was more of a project. </b>But it's clear that I'm very happy that he's our coach, how he's helping me. We hope the successes in the team will continue," he continued.</p>

      <p>Rodri compared<b> Guardiola to Simeone,</b> although the two have something in common: "They both have<b> two very different points of view</b>, two ways of working, but they are ambitious and winners."</p>

      <p>Rodri also spoke about himself. "I am a normal boy, <b>it's important to have your feet on the ground</b>. I want to lead a normal life," he said.<b> "I don't need to be extravagant or have limits in life</b>. I am comfortable the way I am, it helps me to play better. It's not easy being like this in the football world, but the people around me help me," he stated.</p>
      <p><b>Flashy cars are not his passion,</b> he prefers to keep his money for other things. "I have a Mercedes that I am renting, it's what the club give us. I'm one of those who thinks we're privileged because we have the ability to make money and I don't see why we can't spend it. It's just what catches your attention and what doesn't. The other day I saw a news item that said that<b> Lenglet wasn't interested in a Ferrari</b>, but he still likes watches and spends money on that or something else? <b>It depends on what everyone likes</b>," he concluded.</p>
