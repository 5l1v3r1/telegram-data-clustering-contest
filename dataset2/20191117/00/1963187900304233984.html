      <p>CAIRO - 17 November 2019: President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi arrived in Berlin to participate in the high-level dialogue of the G20-Initiative Compact with Africa (CwA). <br/><br/>Egypt's new Ambassador to Berlin Khaled Galal stated that President Sisi will attend the dialogue and hold a meeting with a number of German companies in various fields, the Egyptian state-owned news Agency MENA reported. <br/><br/>"President Sisi will hold a series of meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Schäuble," he added. <br/><br/>"A number of agreements will be signed between Egypt and Germany on financial and technical cooperation.
