      <p>I have long heard the adage that “absence makes the heart grow fonder”. Recently it was put to the test when my 18 year old daughter left for college in August and moved to Southern California nearly 400 miles away.</p>
      <p>Before she left she was extolling her desire for independence and moving from her two divorced moms and being far enough away that we couldn’t drop in.</p>
      <p>She also left behind her 16 year old brother also her best friend.</p>
      <p>During her absence on 10/18 I remarried and she gained another mother, sister, and grandmother.</p>
      <p>September was fine for her with minimal contact and she cam home for my wedding celebration on 10/19th.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter the contact with all family members were minimally daily and sometimes up to 10 phone calls and texts daily.</p>
      <p>I visited twice for multiple days each time in October and November and each time she asked me to stay longer.</p>
      <p>She has a posse of 11 and is on the diving team at school. She has known her roommate for 8 years and they were classmates for 4 years.</p>
      <p>She professes being homesick and also states she wish she took a gap year, but she can make it and is counting down for the Thanksgiving and winter breaks.</p>
      <p>Finals are approaching as well.</p>
      <p>She tells me she loves and misses me daily. The professions of love did not occur before with regularity.</p>
      <p>I love her and miss her and since my separation and divorce from her other mother more than 5 years ago, I did not see her daily.</p>
      <p>I am sorry she is homesick but pleased she is in touch with love of her family.</p>
      <p>I encourage her to develop tools to access her joy and happiness. Growth in living and loving.</p>
      <p>My heart is full.</p>
