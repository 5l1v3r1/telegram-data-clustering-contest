      <p>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) - Lexie Hull scored eight points and grabbed a big rebound in the final 3 minutes and No. 3 Stanford beat Gonzaga 76-70 in overtime Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Hull finished with 20 points and eight rebounds to help the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cardinal/">Cardinal</a> (4-0) avenge a 79-73 road loss to the Bulldogs (2-1) last December.</p>
      <p>Kiana Williams scored 20 of her 22 points after halftime. Haley Jones added 11.</p>
      <p>Jill Townsend scored 32 points before fouling out in overtime to lead the Bulldogs. Kayleigh Truong and Melody Kempton each added 12 and Jessie Loera had 10.</p>
      <p>While Stanford won a first-round NCAA Tournament game at home against Gonzaga in 2018, the Zags also stole a 68-63 victory at Maples Pavilion on Nov. 18, 2016.</p>

      <p>Townsend tied it at 60 with 48 seconds remaining in regulation, hitting a big 3-pointer and Stanford missed a shot at the other end.</p>
      <p>Loera made a pair of free throws to put Gonzaga ahead with 17 seconds left, but Williams responded with a driving layup 9 seconds later to force overtime</p>
      <p>NO. 4 UCONN 83, TEMPLE 54</p>
      <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Olivia Nelson-Ododa had a career-high 15 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks in UConn’s victory over Temple in the American Athletic Conference opener for both teams.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Christyn Williams scored 19 points and Megan Walker added 15 for the Huskies (3-0).</p>
        <p>The game was played so early in the schedule because UConn has four nonconference games against No. 1 Oregon, No. 2 Baylor, No. 6 South Carolina and Tennessee after Jan. 1 as well as an exhibition game against the U.S. national team Jan.27. That made finding dates to play during the normal part of the conference schedule difficult.</p>
        <p>UConn (3-0) hit nine of its first 12 shots, including five 3-pointers and two three-point plays to jump out to a 25-14 lead. The Huskies led by 11 after one quarter and extended the advantage to 46-30 at the half.</p>
        <p>Mia Davis led Temple (3-2) with 18 points.</p>
        <p>NO. 5 TEXAS A&amp;M; 61, RICE 61</p>
        <p>HOUSTON (AP) - Chennedy Carter scored 29 points and Ciera Johnson made a layup with 9 seconds left for Texas A&amp;M.;</p>
        <p>Carter was 11 of 27 from the field, including 4 of 8 on 3-pointers. The preseason Southeastern Conference player of the year scored 17 points in the first quarter, outscoring the Owls by herself, as Texas A&amp;M; built a 24-14 lead.</p>
        <p>Kayla Wells added 19 points for Texas A&amp;M; (3-0). Lauren Schwartz had 19 points for Rice (2-2).</p>
        <p>ARIZONA 83, NO. 22 TEXAS 58</p>
        <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Aari McDonald scored a school-record with 44 points to help Arizona rout Texas.</p>
        <p>McDonald surpassed the mark of 39 she had shared with Davellyn Whyte (2010), shooting 14 of 18 with two 3-pointers and making all 14 of her free throws. McDonald had 22 points by halftime when the Wildcats (4-0) took a 38-19 lead. Texas cut the lead by four after three periods, but McDonald scored 16 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Cate Reese added 17 points and seven rebounds for the Wildcats.</p>
        <p>Joyner Holmes had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Longhorns (1-2).</p>

        <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Mikiah Herbert Harrigan had a season-high 21 points and South Carolina scored the first 32 points.</p>
        <p>The Gamecocks (4-0) outscored the Mountaineers (0-3) 35-3 in the opening period, matching the fewest points they’d ever allowed in a quarter. It equaled the three given up to Belmont in the second quarter of an NCAA first-round victory last March and Savannah State in the third quarter of a December 2017 victory.</p>
        <p>Ashley Polacek had 13 points for the Mountaineers.</p>
        <p>NO. 7 OREGON STATE 80, MISSOURI STATE 69</p>
        <p>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) - Destiny Slocum ignited a third quarter run and scored all 17 of her points in the second half, leading Oregon State past Missouri State in the Preseason WNIT championship game.</p>
        <p>Slocum’s 3-pointer at third-quarter buzzer capped a 13-0 run for a 55-49 lead and Oregon State (4-0) went on to end the nation’s longest road winning streak at 13 games.</p>
        <p>Mikayla Pivec had 18 points for the Beavers. Alexa Willard scored 21 points for the Lady Bears (4-1).</p>
        <p>NO. 8 MARYLAND 99, DELAWARE 55</p>

        <p>Ashley Owusu and Blair Watson each added 12 points for the Terrapins (3-1). Maryland didn’t need a comeback against the Blue Hens (0-3) in their first game since erasing a 19-point deficit in the fourth quarter Wednesday night in a 70-68 victory at James Madison.</p>
        <p>Maryland improved to 13-0 against Delaware.</p>

        <p>Jasmine Brunson had 15 points for the Gophers (3-1), who shot 50 percent, including 8 of 18 from 3-point range. Minnesota opened with a 9-0 run and never trailed.</p>
        <p>Ja’Tavia Tapley scored 16 points for Arizona State (2-1).</p>
        <p>NO. 21 INDIANA 91, JACKSON STATE 51</p>
