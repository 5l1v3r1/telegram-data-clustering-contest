      <p>A female student of the Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, was on Saturday beaten to a pulp by her colleagues. </p>
      <p>The victim, simply identified as Bolu, is a year one student of Ecotourism and Wildlife Management in the institution </p>
      <p>In a video of the incident seen by SaharaReporters, three students including a male were seen beating the helpless female student. </p>
      <p>The male student identified as Obalola, a 300-level student of Industrial Design, was seen using horse whip on the victims.</p>
      <p>The assaulted lady had been hospitalised at the health centre of the institution.<br/><br/>One source at the school told our correspondent that the young lady was assaulted for "talking ill" about her senior colleagues. <br/> <br/>The source said, "The young lady is a 100 level student and she was having issues with some ladies off campus.</p>
      <p>"I learnt that the lady always abused them and also exposing some of their bad behaviours like the "runs" they do on campus. </p>
      <p>"They set the lady up yesterday and confronted her to begin to repeat those talks about them. </p>
      <p>"I am aware that the lady always calls them prostitutes and abuse them for sleeping with guys while leaving fake lives on campus. </p>
      <p>"These are things that angered those ladies and made them to report her to people closer to her but I guess she still didn't desist from exposing them. </p>
      <p>"So, they invited a guy claiming to be school father and he was the one using horse wipe to beat the young lady in the video you saw."</p>
      <p>Authorities of the institution on Sunday said they had been able to identify the students behind the assault on the female student. </p>
      <p>Spokesperson for FUTA, Adegbenro Adebanjo, added that the perpetrators had been suspended while an investigation had also been launched into the case.<br/> </p>
