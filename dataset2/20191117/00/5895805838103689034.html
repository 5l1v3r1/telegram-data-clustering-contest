      <p>When I was younger, I kept scores that don’t matter anymore. Who had the hottest partner? The highest status? the greatest talent? And how could I get myself in among their ranks?</p>
      <p>How could I make my life truly meaningful, so that in the end I’d look back reveling in the glory I had achieved, my beautiful partner by my side and eventually by my casket, thronged by many tearful admirers of note, all honoring me for my greatness?</p>
      <p>It seemed an unattainable goal, but also an inescapable imperative, a quest that wouldn't succeed nor die. That’s what life was, an epic, or should be, culminating in glory.</p>
      <p>And so I kept score. I marked time by my progress toward a high score, invariably feeling behind on my deadline. My life often felt more like a tale told by an idiot signifying nothing. I scrambled desperately to make for a grand ending.</p>
      <p>I’m now farther along – in age, not in status and with a different perspective on status: It is ephemeral. We don’t end our epics with a bang but a whimper.</p>
      <p>Partnerships? They don’t end in glory. Trophy partners lose their Godly auras with surprising speed. Much to our disappointment, they end up being humans like us, often OK, easy company, sometimes not. By our sixties, the hot vs. not thing flattens out to not. People spread out, our distorted youthful beauty gets frumpy. There’s peace in that. Game over. Nobody won. Whether single or partnered in the end, sex tends to matter less, if it all. Our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sex">sexuality</a> becomes nostalgia for when sex mattered more.</p>
      <p>Work? We do it until we’re free to stop, sometimes thriving in it, sometimes lost in it, and often just lost, trapped in clockwatching as we inch toward <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/aging">retirement</a>. We make a little difference, rarely if ever the epic differences we dreamt of.</p>
      <p>If we fight to right wrongs, thwart evil, and prevent trespasses, we turn out to be just border patrollers in a long line of border patrollers. When we die, border patrol will continue. It’s an eternal war of attrition against an indefatigable foe. It’s not as though people will ever wake up and stop being people. Society will not wake up in your name or anyone’s name. The names that we credit with having woken people up – Jesus or Mohammed, Buddha, or Martin Luther King – they’ll live on though often as a mockery of the awakening they promoted. They’re remembered as great but with how they were great blurred and mythologized, which frees the crass to name-drop for cred, often borrowing the status of the great, to promote the opposite of what the great promoted, Mohammed for factionalizing, Jesus for the prosperity gospel.</p>
      <p>Our deaths? If we’re honest we admit what is most likely by far: When we die, our effort and our epic sense of self is gone never to return, not to exist disembodied to re-embody elsewhere. Not culminating in some eternal vindication or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/punishment">punishment</a>. A few people will remember us for a time but ultimately, we fade to a record kept in some dingy file, the residues of our effort folded into the great slurry of un-attributable human consequences. During our epic-striving lives, we resist becoming the statistic we inevitably become.</p>
      <p>Some, of course, insist that their epic continues, though they disagree about how, often doing battle against others over epic interpretations. Fighting over how the saga of self continues becomes their driving force, the central crusade of their epic, insisting, for example, that life is followed not with death but reincarnation or by heaven or hell according to this or that sect’s dogma.</p>
      <p>While we can never know for sure what happens after we die, we can’t know anything for sure and we all agree that some outcomes are more likely than others. Well, the evidence is mounting. When we die we’re dead, and rarely do people flame out in glory. More often they flame out in illness, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dementia">dementia</a>, or some other glaring evidence that we never achieved the reality-ruling mastery we sought.</p>
      <p>And some make their epic crusade their advocacy of atheistic realism like I could be doing here as though I am the heroic epic messenger bravely bringing news of harsh reality.</p>
      <p>I am not. And while my framing here may seem tactless, offensive, distortingly dark, or even a sign that I’m losing it, I mean to say something else by it.</p>
      <p>I see two ways to live, one by keeping my epic dream alive, the other bycoming to terms with what this really is and this short life I’m living.</p>
      <p>I live both ways which means that I have to sort out when and how to live by which.</p>
      <p>I still feel epic though I know I’m not. I still dream of romance, not just nostalgia for those wondrous moments when I felt like I found true love, someone who would affirm once and for all my epic power but in all areas of my life.</p>
      <p>When the idea for this spoiler alert article came to me, I anticipated it being a big hit. That’s ironic, right? Like a cartoon I once saw in which a man at a computer tells his wife standing next to him, “I’m writing a book on self-delusion and it’s going to be a best seller.”</p>
      <p>My guess is that I’ll strain to make an epic of my life until my dying breath, though the evidence is in that I am not epic.</p>
      <p>I have many misguided psychological habits formed in my impressionable youth or perhaps instinctual, a product of my temperament. I no longer hope that they’ll go away. I see no sign of them disappearing though they become more rote and empty with age. I still look at young beauties as though I’d have a chance with them. Of course, I would look at them that way. I look around me more than I look in the mirror. I once had game. I’d likely forget that with age, I no longer do.</p>
      <p>Spoiler alert, and for the record, no generalization made about humans applies to everyone:</p>
      <p>Though we are likely to strive to feel epic, heading toward some grand finale, we are not epic. We are human. Enjoy the foolish delusions of grandeur. They are inescapable for most of us and they will be dashed in the end. The story of our lives does not end like the fictions we relish. Relish the fictions but don’t get lost in them. When you romanticize your life as some epic story that will end in glory, lighten up. When you think it’s all a tale told by an idiot signifying nothing, as though life is just a trivial game, get serious. What we do matters in the end, just not as much as we dreamt it will.</p>
      <p>This week, <a href="http://nwyaw.libsyn.com/">my podcast, <i><b>Negotiate with yourself and win!</b></i>,</a> begins to put lives in a realistic context, not the last word on it but still, a different pursuit from seeking comfort through some grand narrative of our epic contribution. Instead, it’s an attempt to find what’s likable in the likely story of the whole ball of wax and us in it. There will be at least four episodes on that topic. <a href="http://nwyaw.libsyn.com/telos-1-okk">This is the </a>first which frames up the question about what we are really.</p>
