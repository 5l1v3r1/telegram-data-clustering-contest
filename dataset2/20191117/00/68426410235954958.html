      <p>Australia’s Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd. said on Monday it would buy Canadian-listed Barrick Gold Corp.’s 50-per-cent stake in the Super Pit gold mine in western Australia for $750-million.</p>
      <p>The Super Pit is one of Australia’s largest gold mines with an average production of 660,000 ounces per annum at an all-in sustaining cost of about 1,100 Australian dollars an ounce, according to Saracen.</p>
      <p>Saracen will buy Barrick’s half of Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Joint Venture, which owns and operates the Super Pit gold mine. U.S.-listed Newmont Goldcorp Corp., the world’s largest gold miner, retains the other 50 per cent of the joint venture.</p>
      <p>The Australian gold miner will fund the acquisition partially through a 796-million Australian dollar capital raising and the balance through a loan of 450-million Australian dollars.</p>
      <p>The divestment is part of Barrick’s, the world’s second largest gold producer, drive to dispose of non-core assets.</p>
      <p>“While this iconic gold mine has been a valuable contributor to Barrick over the years, the asset does not fit with our strategy of operating mines that we own,” the Canadian gold producer said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to be completed in the December quarter and is subject to regulatory approvals from the West Australian government.</p>
