      <h1>London’s November Culture Crush: What To See And Do In The Capital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Felicity Carter</a></address>
      <p>What to see, do and experience in London, from the sustainable and very boozy Ketel One pop-up garden at the Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth buildings (oh so Instagrammable) to the cabaret-focussed exhibition now showing at the Barbican sharing life in front and behind the glamorous cabaret curtain. <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/"><b>Look at some artwork by an infamous British sculptor</b></a><b>:</b> Antony Gormley has taken over the Main Galleries at the Royal Academy and shows work from his 45-year career, punctuated with major new installations. There’s an exploration of Gormley’s materiality from iron and steel to hand-beaten lead, seawater and clay. Then there’s his rarely-seen early works from the ‘70s and ‘80s, some of which led to Gormley using his own body as a tool to create work.</p>
      <p>Throughout the series of experiential installations, visitors are invited to slow down and become aware of their own bodies. Highlights include <i>Clearing VII</i>, an immersive ‘drawing in space’ made from kilometres of coiled, flexible metal, and <i>Lost Horizon I</i>, 24 life-size cast iron figures set at different orientations on the walls, floor and ceiling which is aimed to challenge perceptions of which way is up. Catch the exibition before it closes on December 3 1019.</p>
