      <p>What began as a simple discovery resulted in a 14 year journey, and ended with a feature film.One night at dinner, Dan Ewen said to his wife, “Hey, have you heard about the Safe Haven law?”</p>
      <p>Ewen had recently discovered the statue which allows for the anonymous surrender of a baby or child at a hospital or other designated location without criminal prosecution of the adult who left the child. </p>
      <p>The designated locations mentioned in the law includes local firehouses. </p>
      <p>Upon learning this fact, it was the notion of kids interacting with firefighters that intrigued Ewen, even though at the time Ewen didn’t even have any children of his own.</p>
      <p>While the topic seems rather serious, Ewen chose to go another route. A veteran improv and comedy writer, he decided to play the situation for laughs, and wrote </p>
      <p><i>Playing With Fire</i>, in theaters now. </p>
      <p>The film features a crew of rugged firefighters who seem to have met their match when they rescue three rambunctious kids. </p>
      <p>But, as previously mentioned, it wasn’t a quick ride from Ewen’s mind to the film flicking on-screen in a dark theater. </p>
      <p>“When I wrote it, there were a lot of comedies that featured adults interacting with kids, like <i>Grown-Ups </i>and <i>Kicking and Screaming</i>, but then people stopped making those kinds of movies for a while,” says Ewen. </p>

      <p>So, he moved onto writing other things. But, his management, believing in the concept, continued shopping the script at every opportunity. </p>
      <p>Once it sold, it still went through numerous changes, explains Ewen. “We had Matthew McConaughey attracted for a bit, and then Kevin James was on board for awhile. Finally, when John Cena agreed to do it, things moved pretty fast.”</p>
      <p>WWE star-turned-actor Cena is joined in the cast by Keegan-Michael Key, John Leguizamo, Judy Greer, and Dennis Haysbert. </p>
      <p>Ewen, speaking to <i>Forbes</i> at a recent Writers Guild of America event, said that he’s thrilled that the movie is finally available for public consumption, for audiences to laugh at. </p>
      <p>However, his next project is a serious narrative film about the fight over water rights during the formation of the city of Los Angeles. </p>
      <p>In addition to that, he’s planning a small screen series with Norman Lear, and his good friend comedian Geroge Wallace. The story is about a teenaged son who leaves home only to return years later - as a daughter. </p>
      <p>While <i>Playing With Fire</i> isn’t really specifically about the Safe Haven law, it did stem from Ewen’s discovery of the concept. And now, not only can he and his wife go see it, so can his 11-year-old twins. </p>
