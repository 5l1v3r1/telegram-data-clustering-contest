      </p>
      <p><b>Kalidou Koulibaly</b> reaffirmed his affection for <b>Napoli </b>amid ongoing links to Premier League giants<b> Manchester United.</b></p>
      <p>United continue to be linked with a move for highly rated Napoli defender Koulibaly, despite the world-record signing of Harry Maguire at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are reportedly keen to bolster their backline, which has been problematic in recent seasons, even after the arrivals of Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly.</p>
      <p>However, star centre-back and Senegal international Koulibaly said he is happy in Naples.</p>

      <p>Koulibaly has established himself as one of the world's best defenders since swapping Genk for Napoli in 2014.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has made 10 Serie A appearances this season and 14 across all competitions for Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli.</p>
