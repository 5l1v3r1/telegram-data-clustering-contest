      <h3>Wada Heads To Court Over Kogi Election Results</h3>
      <p>The governorship candidate of <b>Peoples Democratic Party</b> (PDP) in the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/musa-wada/"><u><b>Engr. Musa Wada</b></u></a>, has rejected results so far announced by INEC.</p>
      <p>Wada and his running mate said the results so far released have been manipulated to suit the <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) and its candidate, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u><b>Yahaya Bello</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands Governor Bello, has taken an early lead in results so far announced by the <b>Independent National Electoral Commission</b>.</p>
      <p>Governor Bello is ahead of the other 23 candidates with over 200, 000 votes margin in 15 out of the 21 local government areas where results have been officially announced.</p>
      <p>However, Wada who addressed newsmen in Lokoja on Sunday, rejected the results, alleging that the deputy governor of the state, <b>Chief Edward Onoja</b> with security agencies were moving freely and visiting collation centers where he changed results to favour his party.</p>
      <p>He added that the PDP will challenge the result in court.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The result is not true reflection of what happened. The people of the state voted for PDP but APC changed the result to favour them.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Results declared so far by INEC is a written result and we can’t accept that. Every single result was change and we are going to challenge the election. The election is not true reflection of what happened in the field.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“I am the candidate of the party and I don’t have to wait till they kill me. I have to cry out to the people of Nigeria to know that APC rigged the election,” </i>Wada said<i>.</i></p>
