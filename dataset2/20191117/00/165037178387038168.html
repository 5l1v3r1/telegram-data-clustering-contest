        <b>Roy O'Donovan and Jamie Maclaren hit hat-tricks on a pulsating Sunday in the A-League, which ended with Sydney FC beating Melbourne Victory.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Brisbane Roar ended their goal drought in stunning style to deliver boss Robbie Fowler a breakthrough A-League win</b> in a 4-3 triumph over Melbourne City.</p>
      <p><b>Roy O'Donovan converted his second penalty to complete a match-turning hat-trick</b> in the 83rd minute as Brisbane twice recovered from two-goal deficits at Dolphin Stadium in Redcliffe.</p>
      <p>The fit-again <b>Jamie Maclaren had fired City two goals clear </b>in the first half and finished the match with a treble of his own by heading home a cross a mere minute after O'Donovan's first.</p>
      <p><b>Aaron Amadi-Holloway hit back on the hour </b>and then went down under Rostyn Griffiths' challenge, enabling <b>O'Donovan to drag Roar level</b> with 26 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>There was time left for the Irish striker to convert another spot-kick following Denis Genreau's handball, securing head coach Fowler a first win in charge of the Queensland club.</p>

      <p>City's collapse leaves the leaders a point above Sydney FC, who earned Big Blue bragging rights with a come-from-behind 2-1 win against Melbourne Victory at Jubilee Stadium.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Le Fondre cancelled out Ola Toivonen's first-half header</b> before <b>Kosta Barbarouses</b> drove the dagger into the club he left at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>The new Sydney signing prodded in the winner in the 68th minute to pile the pressure on Victory boss Marco Kurz, who has presided over a solitary win from six games this term.</p>
