      <h1>Girl, friends bash up conductor, driver for advising her</h1>

      <p>A BMTC bus conductor and driver were badly beaten up, allegedly by the friends of a girl student, who the conductor had told off in the bus on Monday. The girl, who is probably a student, got in the bus between the Cunningham Road and Vasanthnagar bus stops and was taking her own time to show her bus pass to the conductor. The conductor says she had plugged in her earphones and would not respond to him when he asked her if she would take tickets or had a pass. The conductor, Yashodara, 26, told the girl to not waste his time. This ticked the girl off and she addressed the conductor rudely and told him that she would teach him a lesson soon. <br/><br/>It was at the last stop of the bus that her friends carried out this threat. Basavaraju, 46, the driver, and Yashodara, had started their journey from Kempegowda (Majestic) bus stop and when they reached the last stop, Yarrapp­anahalli bus stop, near Dodda Gubbi, around 5 pm, a bunch of people, allegedly people known to the girl, who were in the bus beat them up. Sensing that this can be a threat to their lives, they drove straight away to the police station. Since the victims do not know the names of those who assaulted them, they have filed a complaint against unidentified persons. The police registered the complaint on the next day after taking the statements of the victims at the Hosakote Government Hospital. <br/><br/>According to Yashodara, the girl had plugged in her ear phones and did not bother to respond when he asked her to show the pass or take tickets. He advised her not to delay him at his work, which is what is said to have angered the girl. “We left Majestic at 3.30 pm and the girl got in somewhere between Cunningham Road and Vasanthnagar. When the bus had reached Bamboo Bazaar, I asked her to show her pass or to take tickets. She deliberately delayed me. I repeated myself thrice, but there was no response from her. After five minutes, she showed her pass. I asked her not to waste my time as I had to make an entry about the sale of tickets as there was ticket checking in the front,” Yashodara told Mirror. <br/><br/>Upset about this, the girl is said to have told him to wait and see what she would do to him. <br/><br/><br/>“When the bus came to the last bus stop around 5.15 pm, some people who were with the girl, picked up a fight with us. Some of them punched us on our faces and heads. They tore our uniforms. The girl and another woman abused us. In the melee, the ticket collection money also went missing. The driver started filming the attack, so all of them got down the bus and went away. We then drove the bus to the police station fearing that they would attack us more and also would damage the bus,” the conductor added. <br/><br/>The victims then reported the matter to the manager of the BMTC Byrathi Bande depot (number 48). The condition of the driver is said to be critical as he was badly punched on his eyes. “The case is still under investigation. No arrests have been made yet. The statements of the victims were taken at the government hospital,” said an officer. <br/><br/><br/>A case of assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty (IPC 353), causing hurt (IPC 323), extortion (IPC 384) and intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace (IPC 504) has been registered against the accused.</p>
