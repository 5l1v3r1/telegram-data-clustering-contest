      <p>What are the most exclusive ski chalets in the Alps? It’s a highly subjective debate but these three properties from Swiss-Based tour operator <a href="https://www.leotrippi.com/">Leo Trippi</a> are clearly strong contenders. Think high design with lots of glass, steel and stone, and an overall emphasis on a clean, sleek look. The locations are necessarily remarkable: slope side or just a few minutes stroll away from the lifts. All of these properties come with a bevy of perks you didn’t know you needed, from Middle Eastern-styled hammams to private helipads. The costs are commensurate, of course, but nothing that will make the private jet set blink twice. Here are three of the best from Leo Trippi, who have been in the business of ski holidays since 1882.</p>

        <b>Chalet Greystone, Courchevel 1850, France</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the French resort of Courchevel 1850 lies <a href="https://www.leotrippi.com/france/courchevel-1850/chalet-greystone/">Chalet Greystone</a>. Walking distance to the center of the village and the slopes, the 9,250 square foot stone and glass home is polished and minimal, spread out over four floors. There are six bedrooms that sleep a total of 12 guests, multiple fireplaces and a professional kitchen. The exceptional bells and whistles here include a private gym, a sauna, a steam room and hot tub. There’s a screening room and a games room, as well as a ski &amp; boot room.</p>
      <p>Like all three chalets mentioned here, Chalet Greystone comes “fully serviced.” In plain English, that means that daily cleaning, a chalet staff, the use of an in-resort driver service, a concierge service, daily breakfast, a private chef, airport transfers and all local taxes are included. All food and beverages are charged at local prices. Weekly rates range from €45,000 to €195,000 ($49,600 to $214,938).</p>

      <p>In need of a large Alpine home for the ultimate house party? <a href="https://www.leotrippi.com/france/chamonix/le-chalet-mont-blanc/">Le Chalet Mont Blanc </a> in the hard-charging French resort of Chamonix is a vast, 10,763 square foot home with 13 bedrooms that can sleep 24 adults and three children. There’s a private helipad on the nearly two and half acre property, and a chopper can make the trip from Geneva International Airport in just 20 minutes (it’s an hour by car). There are floor-to-ceiling views of Mont Blanc, the tallest peak in Europe. Not to mention a professional kitchen, a library and Bang &amp; Olufsun speakers hidden throughout.</p>
