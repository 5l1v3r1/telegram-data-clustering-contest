      <h1>Video: Rutgers Cheerleader Makes Funny Mistake vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:03:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Ohio State and Rutgers took the field for what figured to be the most lopsided game of the college football season. Just a few minutes into the action, it was clear why Las Vegas decided the Buckeyes should be 53-point favorites.</p>
      <p>Each of Rutgers’ first two possessions ended in a turnover and a subsequent Ohio State touchdown. The Buckeyes raced out to a 14-0 lead in the first three and a half minutes of the game.</p>
      <p>But they didn’t stop there. Star running back J.K. Dobbins scored his second rushing touchdown of the game to give the Buckeyes a 21-0 lead with six minutes left in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best moment of the game came shortly after – and it had nothing to do with the players.</p>
      <p>A Rutgers cheerleader was spotted clapping after Dobbins scored the touchdown. It looks like he accidentally cheered for the wrong team.</p>

      <p>Oops!</p>
      <p>Not long after this moment, though, the Rutgers cheerleaders actually did have something to cheer for.</p>
      <p>Isaih Pacheco scored on a 26-yard touchdown run to cut into Ohio State’s lead. The Scarlet Knights added another touchdown near the end of the third quarter. But they weren’t done yet!</p>
      <p>Rutgers scored with just over a minute left in the fourth quarter. Ohio State leads 56-21.</p>
