      <p>For the second consecutive year, a Donegal team will contest the Ulster club football final.</p>
      <p>Naomh Conaill beat Monaghan champions Clontibret by three points at Healy Park in Omagh on Saturday to reach the decider.</p>
      <p>The game was Naomh Conaill's tenth match in ten weeks. It took a trilogy of games against Gaoth Dobhair to decide the Donegal final.</p>
      <p>Eoghan McGettigan was the star man for the Glenties team, scoring half of their 12 point total. Three of his points came from play.</p>

      <p>"At the start of the year, we knew what we were capable of after losing the last two [Donegal] finals," McGettigan told TG4 after the game.</p>
      <p>"We knew if we could win this one, we could kick on, especially after putting out the [Ulster] champions [Gaoth Dobhair] in the county final.</p>
      <p>"In Donegal, especially, you have to be more defensive. Coming in here, teams play more open and it gives you more of a chance to attack. We just thought we'd change it a bit and go for it more."</p>
      <p>McGettigan hailed the work rate of midfield duo Ciaran Thompson and Leo McLoone.</p>
      <p>"The work they go through isn't right, you know," said McGettigan.</p>
      <p>"Only for them up and down the field the whole time... They put their head in where some of us wouldn't put our feet."</p>
      <p>Naomh Conaill will face the winners of Derrygonnelly and Kilcoo semi-final which takes place on Sunday afternoon. It will be the club's second time contesting the Ulster final. They lost the 2010 final to Crossmaglen Rangers.</p>
