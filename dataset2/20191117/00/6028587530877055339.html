      <p>For several years now, Luke Combs has been one of the most successful artists in the country music space (and beyond), and now he has finally made it to the top of the most important albums ranking in the U.S.Combs’ new project <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-you-see-is-what-you-get/1479453822"><i>What You See Is What You Get</i></a> debuts at No. 1 on the new Billboard 200, and it does so with one of the largest openings for a country title in recent memory. The set launches with <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8543887/luke-combs-lands-first-no-1-album-with-record-setting-week-on-billboard-200-chart">172,000</a> equivalent units, and of those, 109,000 were actual sales. </p>
      <p>While Combs has never landed a chart-topper on the Billboard 200 until this week, he has risen close to the highest reaches of the ranking before. The singer-songwriter’s debut album <i>This One's for You</i> eventually made it all the way to No. 4 on the list, and it established him as a superstar. The musician followed that up a little over a year and a half later with an EP titled <i>The Prequel</i>, which also peaked at No. 4. </p>
      <p>Combs has released two singles from <i>What You See Is What You Get</i>, and both of them have become big hits, and not just on the country-only charts. First up was "Beer Never Broke My Heart," which peaked at No. 21 on the Hot 100. More recently, "Even Though I'm Leaving" rose all the way to No. 34 on the same list, making the album the relatively rare country release to push more than one single into the top 40 on the all-genre list.</p>
      <p>Promotional single "1, 2 Many" (ft. Brooks &amp; Dunn)” has also reached the Hot 100, though it only lifted as high as No. 97. </p>
      <p>Seven of the songs from <i>What You See Is What You Get</i> have already broken into the top 40 on the Hot Country Songs chart, making them genre-specific hits. When that ranking refreshes in a few days, Combs may collect even more wins, upping his career total even further.</p>
