      <p>The Okyenhene, Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin has said the statement by the National House of Chiefs declaring support for a ‘No’ vote in the upcoming referendum on local level elections does not represent Chiefs of the House.</p>
      <p>According to him, the various leaders of the regional bodies of the House have no knowledge of the statement.</p>
      <p>“The Committee of the Whole House has not been informed or met on the matter in question. The Leadership of the various Regional House of Chiefs have not been informed or consulted,” the Paramount Chief said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The statement added: “The public should expect from Nananom [National House of Chiefs] in the coming days, a communiqué on this critical national issue in line with established consultative processes”.</p>
      <p>A statement signed by the President of the House of Chiefs, the Agbogbomefia of the Asogli State, Togbe Afede XIV, Friday the traditional rulers said: ” While we are aware that the election of chief executives of districts etc. could result in the coexistence of central government and local government controlled by different political parties, experience clearly demonstrates that the culture of “winner takes all” would prevail at the level to the detriment of our united development endeavours.</p>
      <p>“We are concerned that the introduction of partisan policies into local government will be accompanied by the unwholesome political culture and the corruption associated with partisan politics, which has already done a lot of harm to our society and economy”.</p>
      <p>The statement added: “the incidence of exclusiveness, the unhealthy politicization of all issues, the marginalization of citizens who do not belong to the ruling party. and the exclusion of skilled manpower on partisan grounds would be detrimental to development and good governance at the local level.</p>
      <p>“We want the citizenry to know that the referendum is meant to permit unbridled partisan politics into local government and so the merits of the proposed reform should be assessed on that basis. We strongly recommend its rejection by the citizens”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, President Akufo-Addo and former electoral commission chairperson Dr Kwadwo Afari Gyan have openly declared support for a ‘yes’ vote on the referendum.</p>
