      <h1>Babe's bar and grill celebrates final day after 31 years of business</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:26:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:26</time> by <a rel="author">Melissa Parish</a></address>
      <p>After 31 years in business, Babe's Bar and Grill is closing for good on Saturday. </p>
      <p>The restaurant is set to be demolished on November 26, according to owner Lynn Haker. An apartment building will go up in its place. </p>
      <p>On Saturday, a crowd gathered for a final Badger football watch party at the bar. </p>
      <p>General Manager Matt Bettschart said the feeling is bittersweet. </p>
      <p>"I don't think it's sunk in really for most of us," he said. "Customers, staff, it's just hard to wrap our heads around really."</p>
      <p>Construction on the new building is expected to be completed in 2020. While Babe's is closed, a new restaurant owned by Haker is expected to be part of the new development. </p>
      <p>"We're excited for the future, and we think that we'll land on our feet," Bettshcart said. </p>
