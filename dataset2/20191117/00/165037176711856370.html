        <b>Ronald Koeman and Frenkie de Jong were thrilled as Netherlands clinched Euro 2020 qualification by drawing away to Northern Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman said it was a <b>"fantastic" achievement by Netherlands </b>to secure a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>A<b> goalless draw with Northern Ireland </b>in Belfast clinched a top-two finish in Group C qualifying for Netherlands,<b> no matter how</b> <b>unspectacular their performance was </b>at Windsor Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Koeman was a key player in the Netherlands team that won Euro 88 in West Germany, but <b>now he is pulling the strings</b> from the touchline as head coach.</p>
      <p>On a testing night, the one-time stylish centre-back admitted he settled for a stalemate before the end, which is why he introduced substitute defender Nathan Ake late on in place of striker Ryan Babel.</p>

      <p>It did the job, as Netherlands reached their first tournament since the 2014 World Cup, having failed to qualify for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>"As a team, we always want more and better, but we have achieved a great result by qualifying for the European Championship," Koeman told Dutch broadcaster NOS.</p>
      <p>"We've done it in a group with great opponents like Germany and a tricky opponent like Northern Ireland. I also just want to say that it is fantastic that we have qualified."</p>
