      <p>Wasting no time, Eli Sostre is already prepping the arrival of his <i>Vibe God Collection Vol. 1</i> project, the follow-up to last month's <i>EROS</i> project.</p>
      <p>Since its arrival, the Brookly-bred singer and rapper dropped is "San Francsico Flex" track and now follows it up with his newest "This Winter" cut. The new selection finds Eli transitioning between two-track midway through the song as he debuts with an aggressive rapping delivery before conceding to auto-tune-laced vocals to cap off the atmosphere. It makes a strong case for Sostre's duality as an artist and gives us something solid to look forward to come the debut of <i>Vibe God Collection Vol 1</i> on November 22nd.</p>

      <p>I take a cup to the face<br/>I need some love for your love<br/>You got them tears on your pillowcase<br/>You say the past just don't erase<br/>I ain't even tryna have fun</p>
