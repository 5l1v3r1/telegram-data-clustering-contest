      <p>Commenting on the importance of the collaborative fellowship programme with NIH and BMGF, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said, "There are great benefits in investing in research, especially in areas of infectious diseases and immunology, which will help the world in combating some of the debilitating diseases of the world.Â  ICMR is aggressively working towards major advances in preventing, treating, and curing diseases. This collaboration will give us a boost in finding cures that will make lives healthy and productive, not only in India but across the world."</p>
