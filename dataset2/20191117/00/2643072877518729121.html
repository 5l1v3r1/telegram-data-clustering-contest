      <h1>Why Edo APC Members Want Obaseki Out – Airhavbere</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>A chieftain of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/14/gov-obaseki-reacts-as-apc-suspends-him-others/"><u><b>All Progressives Congress (APC)</b></u></a> in Edo State, Charles Airhavbere, has given reasons why members of the party want Governor Godwin Obaseki ousted.</p>
      <p>Speaking to NAN on Sunday, the former governorship aspirant in Edo accused <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/11/obaseki-vs-oshiomhole-edo-gov-vows-to-give-his-life-for-edo-people/"><u><b>Godwin Obaseki</b> </u></a>of refusing to listen to the voice of reason.</p>
      <p>According to the APC chieftain, the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/06/edo-2020-apc-leaders-back-obaseki-for-partys-guber-ticket/"><u><b>Edo State</b></u></a> governor has resorted to the use of raw power in dealing with his political associates.</p>
      <p>He stated that the crisis in the state chapter of the party was not due to “stomach infrastructure” or a quest to share the state resources.</p>
      <p>Airhavbere also said the crisis was never about godfather and god-son struggling for the control of the government.</p>
      <p>The APC chieftain said: <i>“It is all about ensuring governance with a human face and our resolve is to check the destructive approach to governance in Edo State and put our party on the path of moral rectitude, transparency and inclusion.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“The struggle is all about a governor who lacks interpersonal relationship skill; who is vindictive and repelled by the presence of his party members and without provocation, resorts to anger and pugnacious display of raw power.’</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We cannot fold our arms and watch helplessly. With these traits, it is obvious that the governor was never psychologically and emotionally prepared to be a leader.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He said it was because of these issues that `authentic’ members of the party came together on Nov. 13, to suspend the governor, his deputy Philip Shaibu and the Secretary to State Government, Mr Osarodion Ogie.</p>
