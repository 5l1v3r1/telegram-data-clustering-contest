      <p>Reeling from their <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/12/nfl-week-10-takeaways-from-49ers-overtime-loss-to-the-seahawks/">first loss of the season</a> this past Monday night, the 8-1 San Francisco 49ers could have a bit of a reprieve in Week 11. They will host the three-win Arizona Cardinals at Levi’s Stadium Sunday afternoon. A game that some might consider a cupcake has gotten a bit more interesting recently. First off, Arizona nearly pulled off an upset at home against these very same 49ers back in Week 9. Secondly, Cardinals rookie quarterback Kyler Murry is playing tremendous football.</p>
      <p>Add in the plethora of injuries these 49ers are suffering through, and this could be a closer-than-expected affair.</p>
      <p>Here, we preview this game by giving you the top stories to watch, the top matchups and a final prediction for the Cardinals-49ers Week 11 game. </p>
      <h4>Time: 1:05 PM ET</h4>
      <h4>Television: Fox </h4>
      <h4>Spread: 49ers (-10)</h4>
      <h4>Over/Under: 45</h4>
      <h3>Time For 49ers Receiver To Step Up</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>A lot has been made over the past few days about the nine drops San Francisco’s receivers accumulated in Monday’s loss to the Seahawks. Head coach Kyle Shanahan was not about the excuses after this pretty much cost them the game.</p>
      <p>“He’s (Dante Pettis) had his opportunities. The more he doesn’t take advantage of his opportunities, the less he opportunities he gets,” Shanahan said. “He did get a couple last night because of injury and I didn’t think he made them.”</p>
      <p>While Pettis did drop a crucial second-down pass from Jimmy Garoppolo in overtime, fellow receiver Kendrick Bourne struggled even more. His drop in the third quarter led directly to a Seahawks interception and ultimately a touchdown. Bourne also dropped a pass inside Seattle’s 10 late in the fourth quarter with San Francisco driving for the potential win.</p>
      <p>The short of it is this. With Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) questionable to go Sunday, someone else is going to have to step up. Fellow veteran Marquise Goodwin did very little in his return to action from a two-game hiatus. Even rookie Deebo Samuel dropped a couple passes despite putting up a solid overall effort.</p>
      <p>It’s time for these young 49ers receivers to step up. If that doesn’t happen, they’ll be riding the pine with general manager John Lynch looking at potential outside options.</p>
      <h3>Jimmy Garoppolo, Too</h3>
      <p>There’s this interesting theory floating around after Week 10. Either Garoppolo is to blame for the 49ers’ first loss of the season or it’s the receivers. It’s telling that some can’t blame both. Garoppolo struggled with pressure in his face. 49ers receivers could not hold on to the ball. Both can be true.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo lost two fumbles in the game, one of which was returned for a touchdown. He also threw an interception that wasn’t his fault. That’s where actually looking at the game film comes into play.</p>
      <p>We can easily conclude that Bourne’s drop in the third quarter led to Garoppolo’s only pick. We can also conclude that Seahawks defenders missed three or four would-be interceptions. Simply put, Garoppolo must play better.</p>
      <p>This includes recognizing pressure and stepping away from it. It also includes actually going through his reads and knowing when to throw the ball away. We know Garoppolo has a gunslinger mentality. He tries to get the ball through small windows. But with a league-best defense, it might now be time for Garoppolo to play a bit more conservatively.</p>
      <h3>The Kyler Murray Experience</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>His Cardinals might be only 3-6-1 on the season, but this rookie No. 1 overall pick has been absolutely tremendous through the first 10 games of his career. Murray is completing 64% of his passes and has averaged north of 290 total yards. He’s also accounted for 14 total touchdowns and just five interceptions.</p>
      <p>This hasn’t always translated into points for a Cardinals offense that ranks 17th in scoring, but it has kept the rebuilding team competitive. That was no more evident than in Week 9 when he almost led Arizona to a comeback home win over these very same 49ers.. San Francisco can’t rest on its laurels here.</p>
      <h3>Injuries</h3>

      <p>Losing your first game in Week 10 is not a big deal. In fact, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vincentfrank/2019/11/12/emmanuel-sanders-and-other-49ers-injury-updates-heading-into-week-11/">biggest takeaway</a> from San Francisco’s Monday night defeat to Seattle was injuries. Joe Staley suffered a broken finger and will miss multiple weeks. He’ll be replaced by rookie sixth-round pick Justin Skule who started six games in Staley’s stead earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>San Francisco Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle is listed as doubtful and is likely out for Sunday’s game after he was injured against Arizona in Week 9. Kittle missed last week’s game, something that impacted Garoppolo a great deal. It’s also highly unlikely that running back Matt Breida will go after he aggravated a season-long ankle injury.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t even take into account the rib injury that cost Emmanuel Sanders the final two-plus quarters of the Seahawks game. He’s questionable to go Sunday.</p>
      <p>Defensively, edge rusher Ronald Blair suffered a torn ACL Monday night and stud defensive tackle D.J. Jones will be sidelined Week 10 with a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>Team’s go through injuries. It’s part of football. However, this is next-level stuff. Not only can San Francisco not afford further injuries, it must watch backups and lesser-known players step up against Arizona.</p>
      <h3>Top Matchups</h3>
      <p>
        <b>K’Waun Williams vs Christian Kirk</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Williams has arguably been the best slot corner in the NFL this season. He’s yielding a 67.6 passer rating with three forced fumbles and two interceptions in nine games. That is part of the reason San Francisco’s defense ranks No. 1 against the pass. The veteran will have his hands full Sunday against a second-year player in Christian Kirk who has broken out big time. He’s caught 40 passes for 467 yards while boasting a 63.5% catch rate this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deebo Samuel vs Byron Murphy</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Sanders questionable to go and Dante Pettis clearly in Kyle Shanahan’s dog house, San Francisco will be relying a whole lot on this rookie. Samuel is coming off a career-best 112-yard performance, but drops have been an issue. He boasts a 9.3% drop rate. The good news? Samuel also ranks fourth among qualified NFL receivers in yards after the catch. He’ll take on a rookie corner in Murphy who has been relied on a whole lot on a young Cardinals defense.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kenyan Drake vs 49ers run defense</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Drake made his Cardinals debut against San Francisco in Week 9, recording 162 total yards in a brilliant all-around performance. Though, he fell back to earth with a 35-yard outing against Tampa Bay last week. Drake will play a huge role Sunday against a 49ers defense that’s yielded 100-plus rushing yards in each of the past six games after a strong start to the season. If there’s one Achilles heel on this defense, it’s against the run.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jimmy Garoppolo vs Cardinals pass defense</b>
      </p>
      <p>Garoppolo had a career-best performance against Arizona back in Week 9, completing 28-of-37 passes for 317 yards with four touchdowns and zero interceptions. He followed that up with a stinker of a performance this past Monday night. The good news for Garoppolo is that he’s taking on a Cardinals pass defense that’s yielded 25 touchdowns compared to four interceptions in 10 games this season. Garoppolo needs to be spot on if the 49ers are going to avoid an upset at home on Sunday.</p>
      <h3>Final Prediction: 49ers 24, Cardinals 16</h3>
      <p>The 10-point spread here is a bit misleading. Arizona proved it could play with the 49ers back in Week 9. San Francisco’s injuries act as a major backdrop here, too. With that said, we’re still rolling with the 49ers to end their one-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Arizona’s defense just isn’t good, as evidenced by last week’s loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Even with limited options, look for Garoppolo to rebound. He’s proven that the Cardinals don’t have enough on defense to stop him.</p>
