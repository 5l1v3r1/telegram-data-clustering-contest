      <h1>Everything you need to know about Disney+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/323376-disney-streaming-service-all-the-shows-and-movies.html"><b>Disney+</b></a> has garnered significant attention following its launch in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands on 12 November 2019.</p>
      <p>The streaming service offers users a large database of popular movies, shows, and originals, and is seen as a competitor to streaming giant Netflix.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Disney+is not yet available in South Africa, and The Walt Disney Company Africa said that it has no news to share regarding any plans to launch the service locally.</p>
      <p>“All Disney Plus originals are exclusive to the Disney Plus service,” the company said. “At this point, we have no news regarding this service launch in Africa.”</p>
      <p>This means that the only way South Africans can watch original Disney+ content such as the recently-launched series “The Mandalorian” is through piracy.</p>
      <h3>Disney+ content</h3>
      <p>Disney+ offers content from popular franchises that Disney owns, such as Star Wars and Marvel, as well as content from Pixar and Disney’s own studios.</p>
      <p>In total, Disney+ offers its users nearly 500 movies and 7,500 episodes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/323376-disney-streaming-service-all-the-shows-and-movies.html"><b>Examples</b></a> of popular content available on Disney+ include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Star Wars Episodes 1-6</li>
        <li>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</li>
        <li>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</li>
        <li>The Mandalorian</li>
        <li>Toy Story 1-3</li>
        <li>Finding Nemo</li>
        <li>Pirates of the Caribbean – Movies 1-4</li>
        <li>Captain Marvel</li>
        <li>Iron Man</li>
        <li>Avengers: Age of Ultron</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, if Disney+ was to launch in South Africa, it is unlikely that all of its content would be available to local subscribers due to licensing issues.</p>
      <p>Additionally, fans who want to watch anything owned by Disney with an age restriction higher than PG13 will have to use Hulu instead.</p>
      <p>Unlike many of Netflix’s original shows, Disney+ series episodes will be released on a weekly basis instead of all at once.</p>
      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>There is no South African pricing for Disney+, as the service is not available locally.</p>
      <p>Disney+ costs $6.99 per month in the United States, and users are allowed to stream to four devices simultaneously and watch content in 4K.</p>
      <p>This is substantially more affordable than Netflix’s equivalent offering, which costs $16 per month. It is worth noting, however, that Netflix has a substantially larger content library.</p>
      <p>US customers can also bundle Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+, which comes to a total of $13 per month.</p>
      <h3>Effect on Netflix</h3>
      <p>The launch of Disney+ also means that Disney is <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/283964-disneys-streaming-service-is-coming-and-it-will-take-content-from-netflix.html">removing</a></b> its content from Netflix. Disney expects this process to be completed by <b><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-streaming-service-everything-to-know-all-prices/">late 2019</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Netflix has historically been the home of Disney movies, which means that this is a big loss for the streaming service.</p>
      <p>Captain Marvel will be the first movie that will launch on Disney+ rather than Netflix.</p>
      <p>The launch of Disney+ has also seen Disney’s <b><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/327549-disney-market-value-now-twice-netflixs.html">market value</a></b> grow significantly, with the company not worth double the value of Netflix.</p>
      <p>This is a notable change, as Netflix had a larger market value than Disney last year.</p>
