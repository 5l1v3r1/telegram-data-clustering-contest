      <p>CAIRO – 17 November 2019: President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday urged relevant authorities to continue to exert maximum efforts to counter terrorism, extremism and crime, with the aim of preserving the resources of the Egyptian people and establishing security and stability nationwide, the Presidency said in a statement. <br/><br/>Sisi's remarks were made during a meeting with Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli; Interior Minister Mahmoud Tawfiq; Abbas Kamel, head of General Intelligence; and Sherif Seif El-Din, head of the Administrative Control Authority, presidential spokesman Bassam Radi said. <br/><br/>This comes as the meeting dealt with a number of issues, especially latest developments in the security situation and the fight against terrorism, Radi added. <br/><br/>The meeting also discussed the need to continue to provide appropriate climate for development and economic progress. <br/><br/>Sisi also called on the concerned authorities to intensify monitoring and controlling markets and outlets, in an effort to combat monopolistic practices and control prices. <br/><br/>He also urged enhancing the role of consumer protection agencies to ensure the availability of various goods for citizens and make sure they are provided in high quality, according to Radi.</p>

      <p><b>Counterterrorism</b> <br/><br/>Egypt, especially North Sinai, has been hit by frequent terrorist attacks, from time to time, since the ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. The former MB leader died earlier this year during trial. <br/><br/>Sisi, earlier in November, said he had a “relentless will” to counter terrorism as it had badly affected the image of the religion, adding that Egyptian people were in a continuous struggle against terrorism. <br/><br/>Sisi’s remarks came in his speech on the occasion of Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (Al-Mawlid Al-Nabawi) celebrated by many Muslims in several countries, and is believed by Sunni scholars to be on 12th Rabi' al-awwal, according to the Islamic calendar (November 9th this year). <br/><br/>The president affirmed that extremism, terrorism, and physical and moral destruction would not be able to prevent people from moving towards a better future.</p>
