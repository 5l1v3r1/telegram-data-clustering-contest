      <p>The Conservatives have pledged to cut immigration “overall” as the party announced a range of measures to “take back control” – just days after Boris Johnson appeared to row back from the promise.</p>
      <p>If the Tories are returned to power on December 12, the “vast majority” of migrants will need a job offer to come to the UK to work, regardless of where they are from in the world.</p>
      <p>The party said there will be a small number of exceptions, including high-skilled scientists and those who want to come to the UK to start a business.</p>
      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “Immigration will finally be subject to democratic control, allowing us to get overall numbers down.”</p>
      <p>But on Thursday, the Prime Minister said the Conservatives’ promised points-based immigration system “may” mean the numbers come down “in some sectors”, after Ms Patel had earlier said a Tory government would “reduce immigration overall”.</p>
      <p>Ministers have already made clear they are finally abandoning the party’s long-standing commitment to get net migration down below 100,000 a year – a target they have never met.</p>
      <p>Announcing immigration plans, the party said access to benefits will be equalised between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world, meaning non-UK citizens will typically need to wait five years before they are able to claim benefits.</p>
      <p>The party pointed out that under current rules, EU migrants can access welfare and services after being in the UK for three months.</p>
      <p>A Tory government would also vow to put an end to the practice of child benefit being sent abroad to support children who do not live in the UK.</p>
      <p>The party claims these two measures could save an estimated £800 million a year by 2024-25.</p>
      <p>Another measure to be introduced by the Tories would be an increase to the immigration health surcharge from £400 to £625.</p>
      <p>The party said that under the current system, people on a work, study or family visa incur average NHS costs of £625 per year but only pay £400, and it said the change will raise more than £500 million a year.</p>

      <p>The surcharge was originally brought in by the Government in 2015 in a clampdown on so-called “health tourism”, and has previously been doubled from £200 to £400.</p>
      <p>The party said there will be an “immediate cash injection of £20 million this year” to strengthen borders and reduce illegal immigration, including new equipment to better detect illicit goods such as firearms and drugs.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: “As we come out of the EU we have a new opportunity for fairness and to make sure all those who come here are treated the same.</p>
      <p>“We will make our immigration system equal – whilst at the same time ensuring our fantastic public services, like the NHS, are all properly funded.</p>
      <p>“A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world have both a job to come to, and make a contribution to our NHS – so that we can protect and improve the public services we all benefit from.”</p>

      <p>Ms Patel said: “One of the benefits of Brexit is that we get to take back control and make our system fairer. A majority Conservative government will ensure that people who come to our great country from anywhere in the world will contribute on day one.</p>
      <p>“A Labour government would see immigration surge, placing huge strain on public services like our NHS and prisons.</p>
      <p>“(Jeremy) Corbyn would also subject the UK to the chaos of two more referendums, with no time to focus on the people’s priorities.</p>
      <p>“Only a Conservative majority can get Parliament working again and get Brexit done so that we can end freedom of movement once and for all.”</p>
