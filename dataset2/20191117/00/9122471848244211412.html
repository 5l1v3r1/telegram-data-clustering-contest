      <h1>LSU Player Sends Classy Message To Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:06:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, LSU beat Alabama for the first time in eight years, to take control of the SEC West and the College Football Playoff race. Alabama beat Mississippi State this weekend, but suffered what may ultimately be the biggest loss of its season, with quarterback Tua Tagovailoa leaving the game with what has been reported as a <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">season-ending hip injury</a>.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has received well wishes from all across the college football world. If the injury is as bad as it sounds, some worry that his career, and not just the rest of this season, could be in jeopardy. Hopefully that is not the case.</p>
      <p>Everyone from Kansas City Chiefs star and NFL MVP <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/patrick-mahomes-sends-message-to-alabama-qb-tua-tagovailoa">Patrick Mahomes</a>, to former Ohio State and Florida coach Urban Meyer has <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/urban-meyer-reacts-tua-tagovailoa-devastating-injury">sent well wishes</a> to the Alabama quarterback. Now, one of his SEC rivals has done the same.</p>
      <p>LSU’s <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/lsu/breiden-fehoko-father-haka-lsu-georgia">Breiden Fehoko</a>, a native of Hawaii like Tua, tweeted his support this evening. “Alofa atu” is Samoan for “love you.”</p>

      <p>Hawaiian players have started to make a great impact on football, thanks in large part to star quarterbacks like Marcus Mariota and Tua Tagovailoa. Fehoko may play for an archrival, but he clearly shares a strong bond with Tua.</p>
      <p>With Tua out, Alabama turns to Mac Jones, who has looked solid in his absence, but will struggle to match the standard set by his Heisman-caliber teammate.</p>
      <p>Barring a shocking end of season result for LSU, Alabama is boxed out from making the SEC Championship Game. They’ll need to thump Auburn, which currently trails Georgia by a touchdown, in a 2014 Ohio State-over-Wisconsin fashion, and get plenty of help from the rest of the college football world to get into the top four.</p>
      <p>You should never count out Nick Saban and Alabama, but it isn’t looking good.</p>
