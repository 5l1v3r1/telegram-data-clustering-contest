      <h1>Dog rescued out of open recharge pit inside park</h1>

      <p>A rainwater harvesting pit in Domlur turned into a trap for an elderly dog on Saturday morning. Shivkumar V, a resident of Domlur 2nd stage, who was on his morning walk at Doopanahalli BBMP Park located on Yogananda Road in Domlur 2nd stage around 6:30 am, rushed to the rescue of the old and partially blind dog that had fallen into an open recharge pit with about 1 feet of water. <br/><br/><br/>“The security guard was trying to chase the dog out of the park. The dog ran and it seems to have missed the recharge pit that had been left open and ran directly into it. I witnessed the whole thing. I gathered other people, but we could not do much. I tried calling the BBMP helpline number but could not get through. Fortunately, the BBMP wet waste collection workers had been gathering waste from a nearby location. I called the supervisor from the team and got the dog rescued.” <br/><br/>The BBMP wet waste collection team brought in a rope and made a noose and lowered the rope into the pit to catch hold of the dog. The dog was then lifted up. “Since it was not very deep, we rescued the dog, in a few minutes. The dog was fine with no injuries. There are about 6 recharge pits in the park and all of them are open. This is a wakeup call. If a dog can fall in, a child playing in the park can fall in too. The corporator has assured us the pits will be closed. It is an open death trap.” <br/><br/><br/>CR Lakshminarayan, corporator of Ward 112 says, “All the open recharge pits in the park will be closed by Sunday. I have already informed the contractor to take care of it. I visited the spot when I heard of the incident. The recharge pits are hardly 10 feet in depth and so the dog did not suffer from any injury. There was also some water in it which saved the dog from getting hurt.”</p>
