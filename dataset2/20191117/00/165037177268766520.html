        <b>Almost all the players in Spain's Primera Iberdrola women's league went on strike this weekend, but not everyone did. Maddi Torre of Real Sociedad went to Zubieta all set to play against Barcelona, but no other players from either team turned up. The match, like the rest, was called off.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Maddi Torre</b> wanted to play,<b> She was the only player not to go on strike</b>, 'AS' reported. </p>
      <p>The Real Sociedad player had already said she would not go on strike. "<b>I'm the first person to want an agreement on pay and conditions</b>, it's the best for everyone and I want it now," she told 'Cadena SER'.</p>
      <p>"But the only reality is that at the moment, we are on strike and we do not have an agreement. <b>The only ones that is bad is for us the players</b>. It's not the time to go on strike. I told my teammates that and I asked for respect because it's not easy to be in the minority," she added. </p>
