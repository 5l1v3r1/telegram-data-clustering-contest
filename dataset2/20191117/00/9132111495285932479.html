      <p>A former General Secretary of the Christian Council of Ghana is calling for a broad national dialogue and consensus in the upcoming December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>According to Rev. Dr Kwabena Opuni-Frimpong, tension seems to be brewing over the varying views on the referendum which is not healthy for Ghana’s political space.</p>
      <p>“When it comes to democracy, freedom of expression is key and puts Ghana on the right path but the sad thing now is that; the upcoming referendum is creating a national political tension which must not be so at our district and local levels,” he said.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview on Asempa FM’s Kukurantumi, Rev. Opuni-Frimpong urged political parties and opinion leaders to take decisions on the referendum that will benefit future generations.</p>
      <p>“We must take a non-partisan approach in this referendum and build a more consensus approach because going forward, a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ vote will affect the country,” he said.</p>
      <p>To Rev. Opuni-Frimpong, the referendum processes, if possible, must be delayed as measures to curtail the brewing tensions.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he urged chiefs and religious leaders to refrain from taking sides in the referendum debate since they are expected to ensure peace in the midst of tension.</p>
