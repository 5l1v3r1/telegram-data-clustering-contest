        <b>Robert Moreno, Spain coach, does not attach importance to an answer from the President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Luis Rubiales, to a question about his continuity in office and said he gives "more value" to what both the President and the sports director José Francisco Molina "say to his face".</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It hasn't bothered me, in life, in whichever profession, even more with relevance, your position is wanted by many people and<b> it's normal that they question your continuity.</b> I am focusing on the game against Romania, my duty is to make sure the players are in the best possible condition to defend the national team and the rest doesn't matter to me," he replied during his appearance at Wanda Metropolitano.</p>
      <p><b>Robert Moreno showed full confidence</b> in the message he receives in private from the RFEF's top officials. "It didn't surprise me, <b>I don't need to sit down with Rubiales or talk to Molina</b>, who have been the people who have trusted me and in whom I trust".</p>
      <p>"They have always spoken to my face and I value what they say to me in person rather than a question in a mixed tone. My communication channel with them is great, they have always told me what they had to say and the rest we can not control," he added.</p>
      <p>The Catalan coach <b>said he puts a 10 to his job as coach and gave his particular point of view of his profession</b>. "I didn't expect more rotundity because the President and Molina when they want to say something to me, they say it to me and not through the media. I don't understand his response as nothing and I respect what he says to me on an individual level".</p>

      <p>In life and, even more in football, coaches count down the days,<b> there will be one day when you aren't a coach anymore, wwhen you don't win anything.</b> We learn to live with this and I am trying to focus on winning against Romania, as in a national team, winning is a must," he said.</p>
      <p>Finally, he made it clear that he feels<b> "fully backed by the squad"</b> and by everybody that works in the RFEF. "I feel very comfortable, delighted by all the people around me and the work with the players".</p>
