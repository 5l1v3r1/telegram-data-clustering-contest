      <h1>Tua’s Hip Dislocation: Explanation Of The Injury, Possible Long-Term Outcomes</h1>

      <p>University of Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury Saturday in the Crimson Tide's 38-7 win over Mississippi State. In a <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28093292/alabama-quarterback-tua-tagovailoa-season-done-dislocated-hip">statement from Alabama team physician Dr. Lyle Cain</a>, Tua suffered a hip dislocation. Sources told ESPN that Tagovailoa also suffered a posterior wall fracture in the injury. The star quarterback – and possible #1 pick in next year's NFL Draft prior to this injury – was injured late in the second quarter. Two Mississippi State defenders tackled him, driving his right knee into the turf.</p>

      <p>Medical staff immediately attended to Tua on the field. He could not put any weight on his leg prior to being taken to the locker room. He was transported to a local hospital before being flown to Birmingham for further studies (likely a CT scan and/or MRI).</p>
      <p>While I am not involved in Tua's care and have no access to his x-rays or other studies, as an orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports medicine, I have tried to explain a dislocated hip and its treatment and possible long-term outcome in the paragraphs below.</p>
      <h3>Nature of a hip dislocation and acetabular fracture</h3>
      <p>A hip dislocation is a rare traumatic injury of the hip joint where the femoral head (ball of the ball-and-socket joint) pops out from the acetabulum (the socket). A posterior dislocation, like what Tagovailoa suffered, usually occurs when the femoral is driven behind the acetabulum, toward the buttock. In the process, the femoral head often breaks off a piece of the acetabulum, leading to a posterior wall fracture in this case.</p>

      <p>Most often, these injuries occur in a traumatic event like a motor vehicle accident, where the patient's knee is driven into the dashboard of the car, forcing the femoral head out of the socket. While it is not a common football injury (<a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28093292/alabama-quarterback-tua-tagovailoa-season-done-dislocated-hip">Nick Saban calling it "a freak thing"</a> is reasonable), it can occur exactly as it happened Saturday, with an athlete's knee driven into the ground and forcing the femoral head out of the acetabulum.</p>
      <h3>Diagnosis of a hip dislocation</h3>
      <p>A hip dislocation is medical emergency, so getting x-rays of the hip and pelvis are important to show the femoral head outside of the acetabulum. Sometimes a CT scan is necessary, especially when a fracture of the acetabulum appears on the x-rays.</p>
      <h3>Treatment of a hip dislocation</h3>
      <p>Reduction of the dislocation, or putting the femoral head back into the acetabulum, is important to decrease the risk of any nerve or blood vessel complications. A doctor performs the reduction in an emergency room or operating room where adequate sedation can be given to the patient. In some cases, especially when a coexisting fracture exists, surgery might be needed to reduce the femoral head and fix the fracture.</p>
      <p>Whether surgery is needed to fix the posterior wall acetabular fracture depends on how stable the femoral head is in the acetabulum after it has been reduced back in place. Often the posterior wall fracture is large enough that the hip is unstable, so the orthopedic surgeon surgically puts the fracture back in anatomic position and holds it in place with a plate and screws.</p>
      <h3>Complications of a dislocated hip</h3>
      <p>A hip dislocation can injure the blood vessels to the femoral head. Avascular necrosis, where the bone of the femoral head dies, can develop in the months and years after the dislocation. Injury to the sciatic nerve can also accompany a hip dislocation, especially if the femoral head is out of the acetabulum for a long period of time. Osteoarthritis can also develop years later, as the fracture of the acetabulum can lead to a socket that isn't perfectly smooth, leading to wear and tear of the cartilage in the hip that makes running and other sports and exercise activities difficult.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>If a hip dislocation is properly and quickly reduced, and if surgery to fix the acetabular fracture isn't needed or the surgery gets the fracture to heal in anatomic position, an athlete can often return to play. Should osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis develop, it can certainly shorten his career.</p>
