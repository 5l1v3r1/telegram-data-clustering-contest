      <p>British television broadcast a 60-minute bombshell interview with Prince Andrew late Saturday, probing him on claims by a woman who said he forced her to have sex with him as a teenager allegedly held in "sexual servitude" by Epstein.</p>
      <p>During the 60-minute BBC interview, Andrew <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uk-prince-andrew-no-recollection-of-epstein-sex-slave/a-51277791">claimed that the account of him meeting Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a> — who claimed she was forced to have sex with him when she was 17 — must be inaccurate because it referred to him sweating and he did not sweat at that time due to a medical condition.</p>
      <p>Giuffre is one of many women who have spoken out about years of sexual abuse as a minor at the hands of Epstein.</p>

        <b>No sweat, no regret</b>
      </p>
      <p>"It was almost impossible for me to sweat,'' the Prince said in his televised rebuttal.</p>
      <p>Following the airing of the interview, the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> newspaper mocked the prince, suggesting in a headline that Andrew showed "no sweat... and no regret."</p>
      <p>Commentators on social media have painted Prince Andrew as a laughing stock. One <a href="https://twitter.com/JonDennis/status/1195836184544587776?s=20">Twitter post</a> even suggested the prince's best move would be to deny it was him being interviewed by the BBC.</p>
      <p>"It certainly looks like me, but it can't be proven that it actually was me ... And the man in the interview was sweating, and I don't sweat ... I was in Nando's [restaurant] that night, honest." </p>

        <b>Lack of judgment</b>
      </p>
      <p>The British Royal told the BBC that he had demonstrated a serious lack of judgment in remaining friends with Epstein after he had been convicted of child sex crimes.</p>
      <p>He said he remained friends with Epstein because he was "too honorable" to have acted differently.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lack of remorse</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Mail on Sunday</i> tabloid said in its front-page headline that Andrew had uttered "not one word of remorse" in the interview as viewers watched him "squirm."</p>
      <p>Women's Equality Party co-founder Catherine Mayer tweeted that Andrew had appeared "too stupid to even pretend concern for Epstein's victims." </p>

      <p>The editor of the Royal Central website offered more shock than sympathy. "I expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion-level bad," Charlie Proctor posted on Twitter. </p>

        <b>Privacy waived</b>
      </p>
      <p>Celebrity lawyer Mark Stephens told <i>The Guardian</i> that Andrew's strategy "only works if you've got a complete and full answer to every possible question, and here there are too many loose ends."</p>
      <p>"If he'd kept his silence he'd have been able to remain outside of the case, as he's a witness and is entitled to diplomatic immunity. He was a private individual and now he's waived that privacy."</p>
      <p>Epstein was first imprisoned for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy in 2008 and was re-arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019. He was found dead in his cell in New York's high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in August as he awaited trial. Authorities ruled his death a suicide.</p>
