        <b>Exciting 14 year-old Kevin Oduro scored a goal and provided an assist in 20 minutes for Lemignano in a 7-1 victory over Fabbrico in the Juvenile league in the Italian province of Parma.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oduro plays twice every week for both the U14 and U15 side, mostly operating from the left flank because of his incredible pace and great sense of space and movement.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, he is deployed as the target man up front.</p>
      <p>The little prodigy has got a great competitive spirit; always chasing down defenders to force them into committing errors.</p>
      <p>Oduro is quite instinctive in his play making technique; he loves to twist and turn. He has massively improved on weaker left foot after rattling the woodwork with a strike from his left foot.</p>
      <p>This is the second consecutive week, where Oduro has produced such incredible performance after providing two assists and two goals in a game against Sammartinese in 30 minutes for the U15 side.</p>
      <p>His numbers for the two teams are astonishing. He is racked up five assist in the last three games.</p>
      <p>Oduro has a high football IQ and is being closely monitored by teams within the Emilia Romagna region, including Parma, who pursued the young kid join their U14 side last year.</p>
      <p>He is one of the growing young talents in Italy, under the management of Arthur Legacy Sports.</p>
