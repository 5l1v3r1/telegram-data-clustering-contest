      <p>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - An Alaska borough mayor has proposed banning smoking from public parks, which would include cigarettes and vaping devices.</p>
      <p>The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported Sunday that Fairbanks North Star Borough Bryce Ward has proposed a $50 fine for smoking in any park or area of a park posted as non-smoking.</p>
      <p>State law already prohibits smoking in the seating areas of outdoor sports arenas and within 10 feet (3 meters) of playground equipment when children are present.</p>
      <p>Fairbanks borough code does not cover smoking or vaping except where it applies to tobacco distribution excise tax.</p>
      <p>Ward’s measure would enable park areas to be determined by the borough’s parks and recreation department and commission.</p>

      <p>Borough Parks and Recreation Director Mike Bork says the proposal reinforces state law at the local level.</p>
