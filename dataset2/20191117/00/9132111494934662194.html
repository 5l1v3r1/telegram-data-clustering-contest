      <p>The Yilo Krobo branch of the National Democratic Congress has expressed shock over what it calls the snub of the Krobo enclave from the 2020 budget which was delivered and submitted to Parliament for approval by the Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta on Wednesday, November 13, 2019.</p>
      <p>The press release dated Thursday, 14th November, 2019 and signed by its Yilo Krobo constituency chairman, Narh Agbo accused the Akuffo-Addo government of halting various projects begun by the Mahama administration under the pretext of reviewing them.</p>
      <p>“Prior to the 2016 general elections, there were ongoing massive infrastructural projects in the Krobo enclave but when NPP came to power all these projects were stopped under the pretext of reviewing the contracts,” the NDC indicted.</p>
      <p>Projects such as the asphalting of the 15.8 km Somanya-Kpong road in Yilo and Lower Manya Krobo and laying of pipes from Huhunya and Bukunor were cited as projects started by the NDC but which have been discontinued by the current NPP government.</p>
      <p>Some affected roads mentioned by the party as being in a deplorable state include the Sikabeng- Obawale- Agogo- Nsutapong- Ahikwah road, Agogo- Opersika - Perpertifi- Samlesi road, Somanya - Mount Mary - Atua Hosp road and town roads in Yilo, Upper Manya and Lower Manya Krobo.</p>
      <p>The opposition party is therefore demanding what the party calls Krobo’s share of the national cake and ensure its equitable distribution.</p>
      <p>“We are calling on the president to as a matter of urgency, come to the aide of the people of the Krobo enclave by constructing our roads for us. We deserve our share of the national cake,” said Mr. Agbo, adding that the party will not countenance any attempt to deprive the people of what is due them.</p>
      <p>The latest criticism comes on the heels of similar concerns raised by the minority caucus in parliament which is questioning the equitable distribution of the national cake over the 16 administrative regions in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The caucus wondered why provision was not made in the 2020 Budget for critical road projects in the case of the Volta Region.</p>
      <p>Find the full statement below:</p>
      <p>NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS Yilo Krobo Constituency FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
      <p>AKUFFO ADDO NEGLECTS ROADS IN THE KROBO ENCLAVE</p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we in the KROBO enclave (Yilo, Upper and Lower Manya Krobo) of the Eastern Region are shocked that none of our critical roads were mentioned in the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>Prior to the 2016 general elections, there were ongoing massive infrastructural projects in the Krobo enclave but when NPP came to power all these projects were stopped under the pretext of reviewing the contracts.</p>
      <p>For example, asphalting of the Somanya - Kpong main road and laying of pipes from Huhunya and Bukunor to connect pipe borne water to Upper Yilo and Upper Manya respectively etc, have been halted.</p>
      <p>Some of the contracts have been abrogated. It is difficult for our hard working farmers, especially those in the upper part of the Krobo enclave to transport their foodstuffs to the markets.</p>
      <p>Table 21 of the 2020 budget indicated some critical roads and town roads that would be constructed in 2020.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately however, no roads in the Krobo enclave were mentioned.</p>
      <p>Some of the roads in a deplorable state include Sikabeng- Obawale- Agogo- Nsutapong- Ahikwah road, Agogo- Opersika - Perpertifi- Samlesi road, Somanya - Mount Mary - Atua Hosp road, Okwenya Bridge, Oterkporlu Bridge, Huhunya Boti road, Nkurakan- Asesewa road, Gerted road, etc</p>
      <p>We are calling on the president to as a matter of urgency, come to the aide of the people of the Krobo enclave by constructing our roads for us.</p>
      <p>We deserve our share of the national cake.</p>
