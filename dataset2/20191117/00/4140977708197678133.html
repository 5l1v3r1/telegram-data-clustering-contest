                            <p>The Real Madrid frontman did not take kindly to the comment. He responded on twitter asking the selection matters to remain in the hands of head coach Didier Deschamps. He then threatened to play for another international team.</p>

                              <i>“Noel, I thought that you did not interfere with the decisions of the national team coach!</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Know that it will be me and me alone who decides when my international career is over.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“If you think that I am finished, let me play for a country that I am eligible to play for and we will see.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>Per the FIFA rules though, a player can not play for two different countries. They can only switch nations if they have not featured in a competitive match for that country. Unfortunately, Benzema falls outside that category.</p>
