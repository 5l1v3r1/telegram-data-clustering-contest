      <h1>New Lessens For Navy After Spate Of Collisions Between Warships And Civilian Vessels</h1>

      <p>A spate of accidents has raised questions about warship safety which apply to navies globally. Collisions between warships and civilian vessels used to be almost unknown, but there have been at least 4 in the past 3 years. Although each case has unique circumstances, some common lessens are emerging. New information is now available for one of these accidents. The Norwegian accident investigation board has <a href="https://www.aibn.no/Marine/Published-reports/2019-08-eng">released its report</a> into the collision between the warship HNoMS Helge Ingstad and the tanker Sola TS. The November 8 2018 accident claimed no lives but wrote-off the $500 million warship.</p>

      <p>Norway is not alone. On June 17 2017 the destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship, the MV ACX Crystal, off Japan. Two months later her sister-ship USS John S. McCain collided with a tanker, Alnic MC, in the busy shipping lanes near Singapore. The Fitzgerald accident cost 7 lives, and the McCain accident took 10 more. Less well reported, on August 1 this year a Chinese warship collided with a Taiwanese fishing vessel.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian report finds that the warship’s crew wrongly assessed the tanker to be a stationary object. The powerful deck lights of the tanker meant that navigation lights and signal lamps were not seen by the human eyes. And the radio communication was too imprecise.</p>
      <p>One system designed to avoid exactly these types of accidents is Automated Identification System (AIS). This system broadcasts ships' positions so that they can be monitored by other ships and ground stations. In fact you can see where almost every ship in the world is right now by visiting one of the many aggregates of this data, such as <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/">marinetraffic.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Both ships had AIS, but the Norwegian warship was not broadcasting its position. Warships have special rules which allow them to be more discrete when to use AIS. This is because AIS allows other navies to monitor their movements. For example to Russian spy ship Yantar, which <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hisutton/2019/11/10/russias-suspected-internet-cable-spy-ship-appears-off-americas/">arrived in the Americas last week and is suspected of interfering with Internet cables</a>, appears to have turned it off. Even in peacetime intelligence can be gained from monitoring seemingly mundane warship movements. For this reason some navies turn the AIS on but try to obscure the identify of the vessel. As an open source analyst I'd suggest that these ruses aren't very effective.</p>
      <p>Even with their AIS off, the warship might have seen that the tanker was moving toward them if they'd referred to AIS. Or their navigation radar.</p>
      <p>The spate of recent high-profile accidents may combine with the ongoing forth industrial revolution to increase automation in the bridge. Alerts, or even emergency ship handling. We can see that in HNoMS Helge Ingstad’s case an A.I. watching the radar, radio and AIS picture would have seen the crash coming, while the humans did not.</p>
      <p>Ultimately the crews of both vessels were blind to their own assumptions. Each assumed that they had situational awareness, and each assumed that the other did. Ashore, the vessel traffic controller also assumed that the vessels would use the standard 'rules of the road' to avoid a collision.</p>
      <p>Leading navies have 'bridge trainers' which allow officers to simulate controlling the vessel. These can be used for combat training, but they are also important for basic ship handling training. They can simulate weather conditions, ship traffic and other hazards. Today a ship's captain can practice docking at a foreign port many times before actually arriving.</p>
      <p>It's also not difficult to imagine a future where the watch keepers aboard warships have augmented-reality glasses which overlay radar, AIS and night-vision data. This would allow them to literally see in the dark.</p>
      <p>Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that it's training, teamwork, procedure and experience which protect warships from these sorts of incidents. Complacency and over-confidence is perhaps the greatest danger facing the owners of expensive warships, and that threat will likely always be in there.</p>
