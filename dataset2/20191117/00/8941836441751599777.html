      <p>CULLMAN, Ala. (AP) - An enormous German Christmas Pyramid is on display for the holiday season in a northern Alabama city.</p>
      <p>The Cullman Times reports that a German company handmade the intricate pieces of the 30-foot (9-meter) tall pyramid. Then it shipped them to Cullman from the small village of Gahlenz.</p>
      <p>Three of the company’s workers traveled to Alabama to help erect the pyramid near the Cullman County Museum.</p>
