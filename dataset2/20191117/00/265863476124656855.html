      <p>Kelly Dodd’s wedding is right around the corner and now, she is revealing which of the Housewives will be part of her big day! The reality TV star is tying the knot for a second time with her boyfriend she’s been dating for no longer than a few months but when you know, you just know, right?</p>
      <p>Either way, Kelly is super excited to walk down the aisle after her man Rick Leventhal popped the big question unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>That being said, the celeb already knows who will definitely not be missing from her upcoming wedding.</p>
      <p>While in attendance at BravoCon in New York, she chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the news outlet that: ‘Knowing Ramona [Singer], she’s- She wants to be a bridesmaid. I’m like, girl, you’re going to be a bridesmaid. You’re the one who happened for me.’</p>
      <p>The future bride was referring to the fact that it was Ramona who introduced Kelly and her fiancé so she did, indeed, make it happen for them!</p>
      <p>But of course, that doesn’t mean she will be the only one at the wedding and bridal shower.</p>
      <p>‘Dorinda wants to officiate it. I think it would be great, because I’m Catholic and my fiance’s Jewish, so I’m not going to have a priest and a rabbi, so why not have Dorinda? She can officiate. Probably Braunwyn [Windham-Burke] and Emily [Simpson]. They’ll probably be there,’ she went on to dish.</p>
      <p>Kelly has been an engaged woman only for a few days but it sounds like she already has a lot of plans for her wedding day and is constantly brainstorming for more!</p>
      <p>She told the outlet that the wedding will most likely be really big since she has a lot of friends.</p>
      <p>The same can be said about Rick’s circle of friends so that’s even more reason to have a huge party.</p>
      <p>As for the date, she mentioned that they are trying their best to have it on October 10, 2020!</p>
