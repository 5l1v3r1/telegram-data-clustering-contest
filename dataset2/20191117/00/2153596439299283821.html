      <h1>5 of the most popular Black Friday 2019 items in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Comparison website Pricecheck has released new data focusing on Black Friday 2019, with its research showing that the shopping phenomenon has grown faster in South Africa than any other country in the world.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday"><b>Black Friday</b></a> falls after Thanksgiving and traditionally kick-starts the holiday shopping season. It is will fall on 29 November in 2019.</p>
      <p>Pricecheck said that it saw a nearly 200% increase in users day-on-day on Black Friday, with more than 82,500 unique products clicked over the Black Friday week.</p>
      <p>In the past year, a couple of popular South African retailers’ pricing and advertising has come under scrutiny, making it even more important for consumers to ensure they do their homework before spending on any big-ticket items this Black Friday,” said PriceCheck chief executive officer Chloe Lötter.</p>
      <p>“With the large discounts and small margins over the November period, retailers should rather look to use Black Friday as an opportunity to acquire new users, reactivate dormant users, and delight existing customers.”</p>
      <p>Lötter said that the top search terms in the lead up to Black Friday include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fitbits;</li>
        <li>Tekkies/sneakers;</li>
        <li>‘Hoverboards’;</li>
        <li>Fridges;</li>
        <li>Air conditioners.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>While many consumers are prone to spend more impulsively on Black Friday, consumers should do their homework and remain vigilant, said the chief executive.</p>
      <p>She advises to watch out for fraudulent offers, always use safe payment methods, ensure the product is in stock, take note of delivery and return policies, and keep an eye out for hidden costs.</p>
      <p>Below she outlined some tips ahead of the Black Friday rush:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your phone, tablet, or laptop is charged and you have enough data to browse for your favourite products and deals;</li>
        <li>Set a budget;</li>
        <li>Shop online to avoid the queues and the risk of certain stores not having stock;</li>
        <li>Set up an account on your preferred retailers ahead of time to make the checkout process quicker;</li>
        <li>Most online deals will update at midnight so stay up late to be the first to shop.</li>
      </ul>
