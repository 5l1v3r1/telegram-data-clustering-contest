      <h1>Israel Folau Blames Australian Drought &amp; Bushfires On Same-Sex Marriage</h1>

      <p>Former Australian rugby player Israel Folau has blamed the recent drought and bushfires experienced in the country on their decision to legalise same-sex marriage and abortion.</p>
      <p>Folau became embroiled in controversy earlier this year after he put an anti-gay post on his Instagram account, in which he told gay people "hell awaits you". His contract was subsequently terminated by Rugby Australia.</p>
      <p><i>Sky Sports</i> <a href="https://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12040/11863576/israel-folau-links-australias-bushfires-and-drought-to-same-sex-marriage-and-abortion">are reporting</a> that former Aussie fullback was delivering a sermon at a church in Sydney when he made the latest comments. Folau claimed that "god is speaking" to Australia with the recent weather evens to hit the country. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>I'm doing this out of love, for people to be able to hear this message and hopefully receive it with open hearts, that they may come to know the truth of his word...<br/>I just want to see the events that have happened here in Australia in the last couple of years.<br/>God's word says for a man and a woman to be together, one man and one woman in the covenant of marriage to be together.<br/>Abortion; it's now okay to murder and kill unborn children and they deem that to be okay.<br/>Look how rapid these bushfires, these droughts, all these things have come in a short period of time, do you think it's a coincidence or not?<br/>God is speaking to you guys - Australia, you need to repent and take these laws and turn it back into following what is right by God.</blockquote>
      <p>Folau's legal case against Rugby Australia remains ongoing.</p>
