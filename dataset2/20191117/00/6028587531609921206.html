      <p>Describing <i>Path of Exile</i> as a <i>Diablo </i>clone doesn’t begin to do the game justice. The developers at Grinding Gear Games took the loot-driven action RPG framework pioneered by <i>Diablo</i> and built a creative and compelling alternative that’s unlike any other game on the market. <i>PoE</i>’s creators have never been afraid to think outside the box and they’re at it again. <i>Path of Exile 2</i> was revealed at this weekend’s ExileCon event and it looks terrific.<i>PoE2</i> is a creative solution to a knotty problem. The original <i>PoE</i> is a very good game that’s built on an interlocking set of complex game mechanics. It works and it works well. But the developers came up with a lot of ideas about how things in <i>PoE</i> could be done differently as they refined and evolved their game over the years. The problem was many of these ideas would break the excellent game they were already running.</p>

      <p>Rather than try to introduce substantially revised systems into <i>Path of Exile 1</i>, they combined them into <i>PoE2</i>. The standard move at this point would be to replace the old game with the new one but Grinding Gear didn’t want to do that. <i>PoE1</i> is a great game with a devoted and loyal fan base. It didn’t make sense to drop it just because they had a variant of the game they thought was just as much fun to play.</p>
      <p>Grinding Gear’s solution was to treat the two games as different campaigns and combine them into one game. <i>Path of Exile 2</i> presents a seven-act storyline that takes place 20 years after the events of the original game. The two campaigns run on parallel tracks leading to the same atlas end-game content. All the expansion content from the past six years of development along with any cosmetics players may have purchased will be available in both.</p>
      <p><i>Path of Exile 2</i> has the same set of seven character classes as the original but there are 19 new Ascendancy classes and the skill system has been redesigned. Characters in <i>PoE2 </i>will also be able to shapeshift at any time if they have the relevant skill. Bosses at all levels have been improved.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The complex gem system has been thoroughly revised. In <i>PoE1</i>, gems are slotted in individual weapons and pieces of armor. Replacing your gear means reconfiguring your gems which can be fiddly and annoying. Sometimes I find myself running with less than optimal gear because redoing the gems is just too much hassle. In <i>PoE2</i>, each type of weapon or armor has its own unique gem configuration and gems are slotted in a separate gem interface. If you want to change the gems slotted in the bow you’re using, you do it in the gem interface. If you find a better bow, all you have to do is equip it and the gem setup in the interface is automatically applied. It’s a huge improvement.</p>
      <p><i>Path of Exile 2</i> also features physically-based rendering and a new lighting model. Characters have new models and animations. <i>PoE1</i> didn’t look bad but <i>PoE2</i> looks better. You can check it out in the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=9OosC1E8TVM&amp;feature=emb_logo">announcement</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=V2VRRSVgCL4&amp;feature=emb_logo">gameplay</a> trailers.</p>

      <p>The developers expect a beta for <i>Path of Exile 2</i> to launch near the end of 2020. That’s a long time to wait for a game that looks so promising I want to play it right now but there will be things to look forward to in the meantime. More information about <i>POE2 </i>will be revealed in the coming months. <i>Path of Exile 1 </i>will continue to be updated on the regular schedule throughout the coming year and changes designed for <i>PoE2</i> that can be introduced without breaking the original will be added during the build up to the beta.</p>
