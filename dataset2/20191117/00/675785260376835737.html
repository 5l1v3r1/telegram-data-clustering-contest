      <h2>The model-turned-businesswoman revealed the bizarre episode as she accused Boris Johnson of dropping her like a "one-night stand", "some girl you picked up at a bar" or "one of Kennedy's girlfriends"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:01:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Jennifer Arcuri has claimed she rang Boris Johnson over a media storm about their relationship - but the phone was immediately passed to someone speaking Chinese.</p>
      <p>The model-turned-entrepreneur has revealed the bizarre incident that unfolded when she tried to contact the Tory leader on his personal mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Another time, she said, the Prime Minister answered the call and said hello - but then hung up after she demanded: "Why did you block me?"</p>
      <p>She told ITV: "I wasn’t calling to cause problems, I merely just wanted a simple acknowledgment for what had happened."</p>
      <p>The claims come in an Exposure documentary, aired tonight, which claims the pair did have a sexual relationship - something Ms Arcuri has repeatedly refused to confirm or deny.</p>
      <p>A string of investigations were launched in September after the Sunday Times revealed Ms Arcuri went on trade trips with the then-London mayor, and was awarded grants, without him declaring they were close friends and he visited her Shoreditch flat.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister has insisted there was "no interest to declare", all the rules were followed and a referral to the police complaints body was politically motivated.</p>
      <p>But in the new documentary, Ms Arcuri said: "I didn’t know anything about having to declare me.</p>
      <p>"Now if you’re asking if he had declared me, would I have preferred that to avoid all of this humiliation? Absolutely."</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri sensationally accused the Tory leader of dropping her like a "one-night stand", "some girl you picked up at a bar" or "one of Kennedy's girlfriends".</p>
      <p>She said: "He won’t speak to me. [When I phoned him] he heard my voice. And I knew it was him. And he hung up.</p>
      <p>"He said 'Yes hello'. And I simply asked 'Why did you block me?'."</p>

      <p>Asked about the call where someone spoke in Chinese Ms Arcuri said: "I think they were very busy. I think that was a very busy stressful time.</p>
      <p>"I said: ‘I know you’re under a lot of pressure I get that you may not have time to handle this but I’m gonna hang up and you will call me when you’re ready to speak to me."</p>
      <p>Another time, she said, "I was told there are bigger things at stake and I was brushed off as if I was one of Kennedy’s girlfriends showing up to his White House switchboard, you know, here to do my, you know, calling.</p>
      <p>"I felt so disgusted and humiliated that I was told bigger things are at stake, never mind you, he’s too busy for you."</p>
      <p>Addressing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> directly she said: "I’ve been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive, and a true confidante of yours.</p>
      <p>"I’ve kept your secrets, and I’ve been your friend.</p>
      <p>"And I don’t understand why you’ve blocked me and ignored me as if I was some fleeting one night stand or some girl that you picked up at a bar because I wasn’t - and you know that.</p>

        <figcaption>"I’ve kept your secrets," she told the PM</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"And I’m terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside like I am some gremlin.</p>
      <p>"He should know me well enough to know who I am. Shame on him for not answering the phone."</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri was given £126,000 in public money and privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was in City Hall.</p>
      <p>City Hall's conflict of interest rules say politicians must not use their office to give friends or relations favourable treatment.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, a City Hall probe into their relationship was paused following a request by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a Government review ruled a £100,000 grant she was given by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport through a cyber skills fund was "appropriate".</p>
      <p>But she was still hauled into a meeting with DCMS officials on Friday to answer questions on whether her firm will be handed more government cash.</p>
      <p>One of Ms Arcuri's industry colleagues told Exposure she boasted of having Boris Johnson "wrapped around her little finger". And she herself said she sent the then-mayor flowers and candles in a bid to get him to speak at one of her events.</p>
      <p>She told the programme: "He always wanted to know about my dating life, wanting to know about what, whose heart I had broken that afternoon."</p>
      <p>But she added: "It’s really no-one’s business if we were in a relationship or not.  I have seen the way my answers continue to be used against me so I don’t want to answer."</p>
      <p>A Conservative Party spokeswoman said: "Any claims of impropriety in office are untrue and unfounded."</p>
      <p>In response to the programme a Conservative Party spokesman added: "Any claims of impropriety in office are untrue and unfounded. We consider these are vexatious and politically motivated attacks from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Party in City Hall.</p>
      <p>"Previous vexatious and unfounded allegations against the Prime Minister have been thrown out by the courts. An independent review by the Government Internal Audit Agency showed the claims made by the Labour Party about Ms  <b>Arcuri</b> 's company were false.</p>
      <p>"Given that City Hall has made an unfounded complaint to the IOPC, we will not be making detailed comments until that process has finished. Full assistance has been offered to the IOPC so the matter can be quickly resolved."</p>
