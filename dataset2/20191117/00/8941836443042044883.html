      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - School resources Officer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Angela Booker</a> felt confused and hurt.</p>
      <p>One of her favorite students, Athaleah “Leah” Kerchaval, a seventh grader with special needs, usually hugged <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> and called her “Auntie” or “Momma.”</p>
      <p>But one day, a few years back, Leah started giving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> the cold shoulder at Nashville’s Haynes Middle School, even ignoring the Metro Police officer when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> asked the girl how she was doing.</p>

      <p>Leah’s mother solved the mystery.</p>
      <p>Turns out Leah was upset that her sister was going to a police-run summer camp, but Leah was not. Her mom didn’t think Leah would be a good fit for the camp run by the Fraternal Order of Police.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>And Leah’s sister teased her about it: I’m going to camp with YOUR Officer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a>!</p>
      <p>“That really crushed Leah,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> said, adding that the girl blamed her.</p>
      <p>That scenario planted a seed, and in 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> started T.E.A.M. 1 summer camp, a weeklong day camp for girls with special needs, girls who’d captured her heart.</p>
      <p>“I thought, I’ve got to do something to get all my babies together,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> said. “We’ve got to have our own camp.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The first year, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> organized it, planned the activities, drafted volunteers, got buy-in from Haynes Middle School, even picked up some of the girls herself - and spent about $1,000 of her own money for food and materials.</p>
        <p>The campers start each day with a hygiene lesson, prayer and hot breakfast. Activities include arts and crafts, sports and even some science and math exercises because, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> noticed, the schools sometimes don’t teach those subjects to girls with special needs.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> also arranges a couple of field trips to wave pools and trampoline parks, venues that let campers come for free admission.</p>
        <p>The girls have fun and learn a lot, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> said. She and other volunteers do, too.</p>
        <p>“I admire those girls,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> said.</p>
        <p>“They have some for-real challenges yet they have smiles on their faces like they don’t have a care in the world,” she added.</p>
        <p>“But we wake up every morning with full capabilities complaining and griping. These babies who really have something to complain about are happy and loving life.”</p>
        <p>This past summer - camp T.E.A.M. 1’s second summer - Metro Police and Metro Schools contributed staff, food and transportation. Other donors have paid for T-shirts and outings for the girls.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> - who still spends more than 100 hours of her own time to set up the camp - is grateful and inspired by the community members who’ve stepped up to help.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> stays in touch with Leah and her mom, Chequita Smith, who calls <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> “the sweetest, kindest person I know.”</p>
        <p>“Leah is a sweet young lady,” her mom said, “and her relationship with Officer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/angela-booker/">Booker</a> is what puts a smile on her face.”</p>
