      <p>FC Barcelona’s midfield was already meant to have been decided after the club pulled itself round from its worst start in 25 years. Now topping La Liga on goal difference, in addition to their Champions League group, Ernesto Valverde looked to have been convinced by a trio of Sergio Busquets, Frenkie de Jong and Arthur but as seen before the international break, the under fire coach is still tinkering with his sequence of players in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>One constant in any 4-3-3 has been Frenkie de Jong, who since joining from Ajax in the summer for a fee of $83mn has started 15 of the Blaugrana’s 16 games and came off the bench in the other for the last half hour.</p>
      <p>Worryingly however, Valverde has chosen eight different midfield combinations overall in 2019/2020 with the dependance on the young Dutchman leading Spanish media outlets such as MARCA to quip that it is a case of ‘De Jong and two others’ at the Camp Nou.</p>

      <p>Make no mistake, the aforementioned trident is the most relied upon and has been put out six times. Sergio Busquets missing for all three of Barça’s defeats, which have all come on the road, the veteran is thought of as the perfect pivot behind the youthful playmaking duo of De Jong and Arthur.</p>
      <p>Despite evidently improving his fitness however, the Brazilian’s physical condition is still of grave concern. He has already notched four assists to double last season’s tally and is reportedly taking better care of himself, yet this still hasn’t prevented him from being dropped from two of Valverde’s last three matchday squads.</p>
      <p>For Brazil on Friday, he was especially poor and overrun, as also seen in the 3-1 loss to Levante, by Leo Messi’s Argentina in the Superclasico.</p>
      <p>To host Celta Vigo, in the last match before the international break, Valverde went for De Jong, Sergi Roberto and Arthur - the first time this has been tested - but it lasted all of 20 minutes once right-back Nelson Semedo picked up an injury and Roberto had to fill in for the Portuguese.</p>
      <p>Picking up a yellow, the academy graduate is suspended next time out at Leganes and Semedo’s five week absence means he will probably battle Moussa Wagué for minutes leading up to the end of year. These developments also mean Roberto, Busquets and Arthur will not be seen any time soon either.</p>
      <p>Arturo Vidal, Busquets, Vidal is next-best used, twice (the same amount as Vidal, De Jong and Arthur) and gives Barça more of an attacking threat with the Chilean makin his powerful, chaotic charges forward. In this scenario, he has a form of double cover from De Jong behind him to spread the ball around and Busquets tidying up even deeper.</p>
      <p>Due to a lack of playing time, Inter Milan in January is a possible destination for fresh opportunities alongside an outcast Ivan Rakitic that was once a permanent fixture in this area of the pitch. Just the once, Valverde also tried Roberto, De Jong and Rakitic, but as it came in the 2-0 defeat to Granada it is no surprise that this has never been given a repeat airing.</p>
      <p>In the opening day defeat, Roberto, De Jong and Carles Aleña was trialed in the opening day loss to Athletic Bilbao and likewise has never seen the light of day for a second reading. The latter picking up just those 45 minutes in the whole of the current campaign, he has been linked to a new year switch to Tottenham.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, De Jong is one of the most used players in the whole team. Having amassed 1305 minutes in total, his unbridled athleticism next to an aging Buquets (984) and an erratic Arthur (843), as well as his versatility, make him undroppable for Valverde.</p>
      <p>Nearing the Camp Nou exit door, Valverde needs to finally ascertain whether they are ultimately the best two options to join him and his job may depend on it.</p>
