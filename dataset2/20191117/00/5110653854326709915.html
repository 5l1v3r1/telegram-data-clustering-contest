      <h1>Georgia vs. Auburn final score: Bulldogs defense holds strong in low-scoring win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:19:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:19</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>Georgia's defense shut out Auburn for the first three quarters Saturday as Jake Fromm and the offense built a three-score lead, but the Bulldogs still found themselves in a nailbiter late, needing multiple stops to prevent overtime or worse.</p>
      <p>They got both of those stops, turning the No. 13 Tigers over on downs on consecutive drives with the lead trimmed to seven points late in the fourth quarter. Those stops secured No. 5 Georgia a 21-14 road win in a defensive battle that keeps the Bulldogs alive in the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>Yards were hard to come by at Jordan-Hare Stadium on Saturday. Each team had 15 drives, and the defenses combined to force 14 three-and-outs.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite that, Georgia scored a touchdown in each of the first three quarters, all on passes from Fromm, who had just 110 passing yards on 13-for-28 through the air. Running back DeAndre Swift had 106 yards on 17 carries.</p>
      <p>When the Bulldogs opened a 21-0 lead late in the third quarter, the Tigers had 178 yards of total offense, and the game seemed headed to an uneventful finish. Instead, quarterback Bo Nix and Auburn came alive, scoring on the next two drives — and making it look easy. The second scoring drive went 57 yards in just five plays and 1:08, suddenly cutting the lead to 21-14 with just over seven minutes to play.</p>
      <p>With Georgia's offense having fully disappeared by that point — the Bulldogs went three-and-out on three consecutive possessions, which combined to move 1 yard and take 3:14 off the clock — Auburn had two cracks at tying the game. The first ended when Nix threw behind his man on fourth-and-2, and the second ended with Georgia's second sack of the day. Fromm kneeled out the final 1:39, and Georgia escaped with a win.</p>

      <h3>Georgia vs. Auburn highlights</h3>
      <h4>Final: Georgia 21, Auburn 14</h4>
      <p><b>7:25 p.m.:</b> <b>TURNOVER ON DOWNS, Auburn.</b> Georgia sacks Nix on fourth-and-10, and the Bulldogs will come away from Jordan-Hare with a win. Got a bit nervy at the end, but a dominant performance from Georgia's defense.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>7:22 p.m.:</b> Sure enough, Auburn gets another three-and-out. The Tigers take over on their own 27 with 1:59 to play.</p>
      <p><b>7:16 p.m.:</b> TURNOVER ON DOWNS, Auburn. A first-down catch is wiped off because Seth Williams couldn't quite stay in bounds. On fourth-and-2 a couple of plays later, Nix rolls out and has a man, but the pass to Harold Joiner falls incomplete. The Tigers have three timeouts and more than two minutes on the clock, though.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>7:10 p.m.:</b> Nix scrambles to pick up a fourth-and-5 around midfield. Now about 3 minutes left.</p>
      <p><b>7:06 p.m.:</b> Georgia goes three-and-out for the second straight drive. The Bulldogs' two drives since taking a 21-0 lead have taken less than 3 minutes off the clock.</p>
      <p><b>6:58 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Auburn.</b> The Tigers score in a flash: 5 plays, 57 yards in 68 seconds. Gains of 24, 14, 9, 8 and then Nix takes a keeper in from 2 yards out. All of a sudden, Auburn trails by just a touchdown with about 7 minutes to go. <b>Georgia 21, Auburn 14.</b></p>

      <p><b>6:55 p.m.:</b> Georgia goes three-and-out.</p>
      <p><b>6:50 p.m.:</b> Auburn thought it had recovered a surprise onside kick, but replay review takes it away because a Tiger blocked too early. A huge momentum shift.</p>
      <p><b>6:43 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Auburn</b> . The Tigers get on the board and keep this at least somewhat interesting. Nix hits Eli Stove out of the backfield for a short score early in the fourth quarter. <b>Georgia 21, Auburn 7.</b></p>

      <p><b>6:41 p.m.:</b> The Tigers offense has woken up, and a pass interference call on fourth down gives them a first-and-goal.</p>
      <h4>End third quarter: Georgia 21, Auburn 0</h4>
      <p><b>6:25 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Georgia.</b> Fromm hits Eli Wolf for a 5-yard score. A very steep climb for the Tigers now. <b>Georgia 21, Auburn 0.</b></p>

      <p><b>6:21 p.m.:</b> The Bulldogs have a touchdown wiped off the board after a replay review shows Kearis Jackson couldn't get a foot down in bounds. Would've been a potential dagger, but Georgia is still in the red zone.</p>
      <p><b>6:16 p.m.:</b> The second half has started with four consecutive punts. Defenses are still reigning supreme.</p>
      <h4>Halftime: Georgia 14, Auburn 0</h4>
      <p><b>5:25 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN, Georgia.</b> On the first play after the medical delay, Fromm hits Herrien for a 5-yard score. The Tigers, who called timeout with 32 seconds left two plays earlier, will trail by two touchdowns at halftime. <b>Georgia 14, Auburn 0.</b></p>
      <p><b>5:20 p.m.:</b> Scary scene in Jordan-Hare Stadium. A photographer on the sideline has been knocked out, and the stretcher and neck brace are being brought out. The photographer is reportedly conscious and responding to medical officials.</p>
      <p><b>5:02 p.m.:</b> FUMBLE, Auburn. The Tigers were moving down the field (a notable accomplishment in this game) but Bo Nix fumbles it in Bulldogs territory, and Georgia takes over.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>4:55 p.m.:</b> The defenses have dominated the second quarter. There have been 6 drives and 57 total yards. Swift did pull out this sick spin move, though.</p>

      <p><b>4:02 p.m.:</b> Auburn quickly punts it back.</p>
      <p><b>3:57 p.m.:</b> The Bulldogs go three-and-out, but a 67-yard(!!!) punt will pin the Tigers at the 2-yard line.</p>
      <p><b>3:52 p.m.:</b> <b>MISSED FIELD GOAL, Auburn.</b> The Tigers elect to kick after the timeout, but the 47-yarder goes wide right.</p>
      <p><b>3:51 p.m.:</b> The Tigers call timeout, facing fourth-and-3 from just inside the Georgia 30. They were lined up to go for it.</p>
      <p><b>3:47 p.m.:</b> Auburn gets 15 yards on the first play, and the Tigers are already near midfield.</p>
