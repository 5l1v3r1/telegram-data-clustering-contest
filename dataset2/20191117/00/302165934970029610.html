      <p>PARIS, Nov 17 — Wales kept their hopes of reaching Euro 2020 alive yesterday after beating Azerbaijan 2-0 and piling pressure on their rivals in a tight Group E.</p>
      <p>With two teams qualifying, Ryan Giggs’ side moved into third thanks to first-half headed goals from Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson.</p>
      <p>They are one point behind second-placed Hungary, who travel to Cardiff on the final day as four teams vie for a spot in next summer’s finals.</p>
      <p>Group leaders Croatia will seal their place later with a draw at home to fourth-placed Slovakia, who are a point behind Wales and can jump into second with a win over the World Cup finalists.</p>
      <p>Wales would be knocked back down to fourth in their five-team group and would need a miracle should Croatia lose, as in their final match Slovakia take on an Azerbaijan side that have collected just one point.</p>
      <p>However, a Croatia win would set up a winner-takes-all clash with the Hungarians.</p>
      <p>In Saint Petersburg, the Hazard brothers made short work of Russia as already-qualified Belgium maintained their 100 percent record with a 4-1 win that secured them top spot in Group I.</p>
      <p>Eden and Thorgan Hazard put Roberto Martinez’s side three goals ahead at the break before in-form Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku crashed home the fourth in the 72nd minute to make absolutely sure of the result.</p>
      <p>Georgi Dzhikiya scored a consolation for the hosts 11 minutes from the end.</p>
      <p>Belgium are top scorers in qualifying with 34 goals in nine matches, and stretch their lead over second-place Russia to six points with one game remaining.</p>
      <p>Both are already assured of a place in the Euros as their closest rivals Scotland are a fully nine points behind Russia despite their 2-1 win at Cyprus earlier yesterday.</p>
      <p>In the group’s other game Filippo Berardi scored rock bottom San Marino’s first goal in qualifying in a 3-1 home defeat to Kazakhstan, slotting home in the 77th minute after rounding goalkeeper Dmytro Nepogodov with his side already three goals down.</p>
      <p>However, they have picked up no points and conceded 46 goals in another miserable campaign.</p>
      <p>In Group G, Slovenia beat Latvia 1-0 to move third, two points from Austria, but are unlikely to progress from the group as the Austrians just need a draw against North Macedonia later to seal their spot. — AFP</p>
