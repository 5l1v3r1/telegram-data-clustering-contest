      <p>MILAN, Nov 17 — The coach of an Italian junior league team was sacked yesterday for inflicting a humiliating 27-0 defeat on their opponents.</p>
      <p>Paolo Brogelli, president of Invictasauro, a team based in Grosseto, Tuscany, slammed his team’s win over rivals Marina Calcio as “disrespectful”.</p>
      <p>“We learned with amazement and regret the score of the match in which our junior team scored 27 goals,” Brogelli said in a statement reported in the Italian press.</p>
      <p>“The values of youth team football are antithetical to such a thing.</p>
      <p>“The opponent must always be respected and today it has not happened. As president I sincerely apologise to the Marina team. Our board has decided, unanimously, to sack (coach) Mr Riccini.</p>
      <p>“Our coaches have a duty to train and, above all, to educate children. This has not happened today.” — AFP</p>
