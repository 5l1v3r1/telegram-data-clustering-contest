      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:30:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Week 12 of the 2019 college football season has already featured a couple of notable results when it comes to the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Minnesota, No. 8 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings, lost on the road to Iowa. The Hawkeyes were technically favored, though it’s still a considerable upset, with the Golden Gophers being undefeated heading into the game.</p>
      <p>Georgia remained alive in the race, meanwhile, as the Bulldogs went on the road and took down Auburn.</p>
      <p>FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-college-football-predictions/">has since updated</a> its College Football Playoff predictions.</p>
      <p>The latest top four:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Georgia is currently the first team out, per FiveThirtyEight, with a 32 percent chance of making it in. Oklahoma has a 27 percent chance, with Utah at 21 percent and Alabama all the way down at 19 percent.</p>
