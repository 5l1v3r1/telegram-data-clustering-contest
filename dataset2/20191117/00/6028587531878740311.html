      <h1>Travel Insight: Exploring The Portuguese Flavour of Goa</h1>

      <p>Outside, the sky is heavy with ominous-looking clouds – it’s the end of the monsoon season in Goa, and the sun is struggling to shine. Inside the <a href="https://www.figueiredohouse.com/"><b>Figueiredo House</b></a>, in the village of Loutolim, it’s also dark – but this time it’s with the laden import that comes with a history dating back to 1590.</p>

      <p>Goa’s oldest home overlooks gracious paddy fields, where buffalos are roaming, while its front terrace is ablaze with fuchsia bougainvillea. Part museum, part homestay, guests are able to step back in time in rooms that haven’t much changed over the years. It’s a curious place – its sense of history strong – and still owned by the same Figueiredo family. There’s a beautifully-restored dining hall, complete with imposing, carved wood furniture, Belgian chandeliers of milky crystal glass and cabinets of fine dinner services, one remains intact from the East India Company, once used for grand dinners. It’s a fascinating snapshot of the history of Goa over the ages – a rare chance to see inside a restored historic house, in a destination where many properties were dismantled by families over the years. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>These days, the house is looked after by Pedro Figueiredo de Albuquerque, one of the younger ancestors of the family, who were originally among the first Portuguese settlers to arrive in Goa and who played an important role to the area’s history. Bringing a modern-day vision to proceedings, the family have restored many of the rooms and showcased its beautiful and rare contents – from a marquetry chest, one of only three in the world, to ornate furniture with Hindu-Portuguese rosewood carvings. Bringing a wealth of intricate knowledge, handed down from hours listening to his grandparents no doubt, a museum tour is well worth doing, as is booking one of the newer rooms in the house for an overnight stay, offered as part of a charming homestay.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese heritage can be further soaked up, less than an hour’s drive away, in Panjim, the capital city of the state of Goa. Here, the <b>Fontainhas </b>area – also known as the Latin Quarter – was founded in the late 18<sup>th </sup>century by a wealthy Portuguese named Antonio Joao de Sequeira. It is now a heritage zone due to its cobbled streets, lined with houses and cottages painted in paint-box primary colours, with red coloured roof tiles. The stark-white 19<sup>th </sup>century <b>Chapel of St. Sebastian </b>stands out like an innocent amid the eye-popping, candy colours. Interestingly, once the September skies clear, with the promise of sunshine to come, residents bring out their paintbrushes to honour an age-old rule, which still remains in place, and which states that each home should be repainted after each monsoon season – to retain their bright appeal. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>You can wander around the streets to soak up the ambiance, stopping in at boutique bakeries and art shops along the way. For a cup of chai or a Goan Feni cocktail, head to the <b>Verandah Restaurant</b>, found at the <a href="http://www.panjiminn.com/"><b>WelcomHeritage Panjim Inn</b></a><b> </b>– a boutique-style restaurant-with-rooms carved out of 130-year-old family mansion. Its first-floor terrace is the perfect spot for people-watching on the bustling Goan street below.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For longer stays in Southern Goa, take a short drive south along the shore-line to the alluring<a href="https://www.itchotels.in/hotels/goa/itcgrandgoa.html"> <b>ITC Grand Goa</b></a> – found on <b>Arrosim Beach, </b>one of Goa’s most unspoilt stretches of coastline. The pink sandstone resort was, until recently, a Park Hyatt property, but has now been taken over by the ITC group, which puts a ‘sustainable luxury’ ethos at the core of all its properties dotted across India. Built to resemble a typical Portuguese village, its rooms are based on traditional pousadas, fringed with frangipani on the outside, and built around ‘village squares’ with tinkling fountains and Portuguese mosaic tiling. At its heart is a terraced pool area – one of the largest pools in India – and perfect for cooling off after a day exploring. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Spread over 45 acres of gardens, with coconut palms and lagoons, each area of the hotel is connected by bridges – a nice nod to Goa’s 30 different bridges – and a few days spent here means you can really immerse yourself in the <i>sosegado</i>, an old Portuguese term that sums up the laid-back vibe of this mix-match of beachside cultures.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Referencing the different cultures that have settled in this part of South Goa over the ages also extends to the design of the hotel – the lobby, for instance, is designed like a traditional Goan home – with mirror work, large pillars and cane chairs. Rooms have outdoor spaces, some with al fresco rain showers on terraces and lap pools. Bedrooms channel an Indo-Portuguese heritage with carved wood beds, hardwood floors, crisp white linens and teak dressing areas.</p>

        <figcaption>The bedroom interiors are classic and elegant.<cite>(Credit: ITC)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A real focus at the Grand Goa is the cuisine, with a choice of five different restaurants. <b>Ottimo</b> offers rustic Italian menus – with wood-fired pizzas and classics, such as parmigiana, risotto al fungi. Try the Prawn Caponata, which uses local Goan tiger prawns with vegetable caponata in a vodka and tomato butter. <b>Pavilion at the Village Square</b> is inspired by a casual Indian café; and the <b>Royal Afghan</b>, a beachside barbecue restaurant, focuses on seafood cooked on the grill and an outdoor tandoor oven. <b>Kebabs &amp; Kurries</b>, meanwhile, calls on ancient local recipes reinvented for a modern-day guest. Labgeer, for instance, are delicate aromatic patties of fresh beetroot stuffed with a mixture of green chilies, mint, cashew and cheese, while Jingha Hara Masala is made of fresh bay prawns tossed with spring onions and ‘hara masala’ of coriander, mint, green chilies and garlic. Macchli Tikka – was a standout –morsels of marinated fish with tandoori curd masala is cooked to perfection in tandoor and delicious served with saffron-seasoned rice and black lentil dahl.  </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Another highlight is the <b>Tempero</b> restaurant, which focuses on Goan cuisine, and has a colonial-style dining room with traditional tiling and windows with in-laid mother-of-pearl. Translating as ‘seasoning’ in Portuguese, the restaurant is overseen by chef Sacramenta Carvelho. Showcasing mouth-watering Indo-Portuguese fusion flavours, it’s immediately evident that she knows how to justify the name of the restaurant. Tasting platters feature dishes such as Mushroom Peri Peri, Rissois de Camarao – deep-fried pastries stuffed with shrimp and Fofos de Peixe – breadcrumbed meatballs with onions and chilli. The Bhindi Solatulem – an okra curry – and the Chouli Ros -  a black-eyed bean curry – make for the perfect feast, especially with a classic Goan Prawn Curry, not forgetting the local unpolished red rice and fresh naan breads. Go hungry.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Finally, there’s the sprawling <b>Kaya Kalp Royal Spa</b>, which brings its own take on Goa’s rich culture. Inspired by the ancient beauty rituals of India – many therapies are rooted in Ayurveda, using indigenous herbs and spices. There are guided meditations and classic ‘must-tries’ such as the Abhyanga Massage (whereby two therapists use long strokes and traditional oils – to equal pure bliss). The Goan Cashew ritual takes the local cashew nut as inspiration (used in the scrub and made into an oil), while – and not for the faint-hearted – there are even ‘deep cleansing’ therapies, including Snehapanam – which involves the ritualistic drinking of medicated ghee to purify your system and Nasyam, during which medicated oil is infused into the nose – said to help migraines.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>More appealing, perhaps, is the signature Pomegranate Ritual – which will take you to a zen-like state. Firstly a pomegranate scrub, mixed with organic brown sugar, is used to gently exfoliate the body, then essential oils are dripped over your body and massaged in. The treatment includes a head and Indian foot massage – leaving you buttery soft and blissfully happy. It’s Goan through and through.</p>
