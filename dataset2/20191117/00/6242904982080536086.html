        <b>The kick off time for Monday’s 2021 African Nations Cup qualifier between Sao Tome and Ghana has been brought forward by the Confederation of African Football (CAF).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The match was originally scheduled to take place on Monday at 1500GMT.</p>
      <p>However an unexplained decision by CAF has forced the match to be brought forward by two hours.</p>
      <p>São Tomé and Principe will hope to get their qualifying campaign back on track when they host the Black Stars at the Estadio Nacional 12 de Julho on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Falcons started their campaign on a stuttering note when they lost 4-0 against Sudan on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Ghana meanwhile will be aiming to make it a second win in a row after beating South Africa 2-0 in the opening fixture in Cape Coast on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ghana are on the same points as Sudan who will battling it out with South Africa on Sunday.</p>
