      <p>Protests have erupted across Iran after the government unexpectedly announced it was rationing petrol and increasing its price and two people have been killed and several more people were injured.</p>
      <p>Prices rose by at least 50 percent as subsidies on petrol were reduced.</p>

      <p>The authorities say they want to free up money to help the poor.</p>
      <p>Iran is already suffering economically due to stiff sanctions imposed by the US after Washington decided to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.</p>
      <p>State news agency Irna says there were clashes with police when protesters attacked a fuel storage warehouse and tried to set fire to it.</p>
