      <p>As the busy holiday travel season approaches, a new dataset crunched by the team at The Points Guy may give insight into how expensive a trip to the airport may be. <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/most-and-least-expensive-us-airports/">According to the new study</a>, New York City’s three airports are among the top five most expensive in the nation to travel through. Washington Dulles and San Francisco International fill out the rest of the top slots.The least expensive airports in the country are led by Las Vegas McCarran, Orlando International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International, three big airports for leisure travelers. The Bay Area’s San Jose and Oakland International airports round out the top five for the least expensive.</p>
      <p>The top five most expensive airports in order according to the study were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>(EWR) Newark Liberty International Airport</li>
        <li>(JFK) John F. Kennedy International Airport</li>
        <li>(IAD) Dulles International Airport</li>
        <li>(SFO) San Francisco International Airport</li>
        <li>(LGA) LaGuardia Airport</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The top five least expensive airports in order were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>(LAS) McCarran International Airport</li>
        <li>(MCO) Orlando International Airport</li>
        <li>(FLL) Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport</li>
        <li>(SJC) San Jose International Airport</li>
        <li>(OAK) Oakland International Airport</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In order to make the calculations, researchers at The Points Guy took both the average price of airfare – which accounts for half of an airports score – as well as on-site and transit costs into account. At Newark International Airport, for example, most passengers traveling through the hub need to connect into greater New York City – a journey that can cost upwards of $100. That factor heavily weighted into making it one of the most expensive in the rankings.</p>
      <p>The cost of transit, in fact, was a major deciding factor for all New York Airports, which are situated in difficult-to-access corners of the city. Taking a taxi from midtown Manhattan to any of the city’s three big airports costs a minimum of $50 for a shared car while a private Uber or Lyft adds at least another 10%.</p>
      <p>Another factor that the researchers considered was the cost of amenities such as a baggage cart or cup of coffee inside of the terminal. At Oakland International, for example, a cup of Peet’s coffee costs $2.65 while one can expect to pay about $3.10 in LaGuardia.</p>
      <p>“Airfare is only part of the equation when calculating the true cost of a vacation,” suggested Scott Mayerowitz, Executive News Director for The Points Guy “Sometimes it might actually be cheaper to pay $10 more per ticket in order to save much more on a taxi or food at the airport. Savvy travelers can use our research to make informed decisions ahead of their next trip.”</p>
      <p>Each journey to the airport, of course, is slightly different for every traveler – and the spending habits of one frugal passenger can vary differently another that’s simply willing to pay for convenience. At JFK in New York City for example, one can cut transit costs dramatically by spending 90 minutes on the subway.</p>
      <p>If anything, the new research from The Points Guy helps travelers keep transit costs in mind as the busy holiday season approaches. And if a traveler has an option to skip one of these expensive airports in lieu of transiting through a cheaper alternative, this insight can help make that decision.</p>
