        <b>Ronald Koeman and Frenkie de Jong were thrilled as Netherlands clinched Euro 2020 qualification by drawing away to Northern Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman said it was a “fantastic” achievement by Netherlands to secure a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>A goalless draw with Northern Ireland in Belfast clinched a top-two finish in Group C qualifying for Netherlands, no matter how unspectacular their performance was at Windsor Park on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Koeman was a key player in the Netherlands team that won Euro 88 in West Germany, but now he is pulling the strings from the touchline as head coach.</p>
      <p>On a testing night, the one-time stylish centre-back admitted he settled for a stalemate before the end, which is why he introduced substitute defender Nathan Ake late on in place of striker Ryan Babel.</p>
      <p>It did the job, as Netherlands reached their first tournament since the 2014 World Cup, having failed to qualify for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>“As a team, we always want more and better, but we have achieved a great result by qualifying for the European Championship,” Koeman told Dutch broadcaster NOS.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done it in a group with great opponents like Germany and a tricky opponent like Northern Ireland. I also just want to say that it is fantastic that we have qualified.”</p>

      <p>Netherlands were unconvincing, and with Memphis Depay absent through injury they struggled to make an impression in attack.</p>
      <p>Babel was perhaps their biggest threat, but that was only because Steven Berghuis did not look up to the task. Steven Davis missing a penalty for Northern Ireland was a blessed relief to the visitors.</p>
      <p>Yet like his captain Virgil van Dijk, who expressed similar sentiments, Koeman was chiefly concerned about getting the job done.</p>
      <p>The draw sufficed, and Koeman, who took on the Netherlands job in February 2018, said: “I am happy and proud of the team. I also think you can now forget how tonight’s game went.”</p>
      <p>He admitted Netherlands “should have done more attacking-wise”, but it did not appear to trouble him unduly. There is time to look for solutions now the Dutch are sure of their place at the 24-team tournament.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Frenkie de Jong, who moved from Ajax to Barcelona in the close season, is relishing his first senior finals with Netherlands.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t played a final tournament for a while, so everyone is happy,” De Jong told NOS. “We have taken a photo together and we are certainly happy that we made it. I don’t think we should be too critical, but I feel we should have won here.”</p>
      <p>De Jong added: “We did too little with the ball; attacking-wise we could have done more. But we’re going to the European Championship and that is the most important thing.”</p>
