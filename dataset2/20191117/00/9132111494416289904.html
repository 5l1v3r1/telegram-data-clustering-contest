      <p>The Forces Old Students Association (FOSA), last Thursday celebrated its maiden homecoming at Burma camp in Accra.</p>
      <p>The four day celebration under the theme: “Quality Education and Discipline, My Role”, was aimed at reuniting all past students of the school and rejuvenate alumni activities that will foster development of the school.</p>
      <p>Launching the event at the Garrison Methodist Presbyterian Church (GMPC), the President of FOSA, Mr Harrison Ashong Tawiah said the primary purpose of reuniting all past students of Forces Senior High Technical School (FSHTS), was to help raise funds to construct an ultra-modern sickbay to cater for the healthcare of students.</p>
      <p>According to him ,the old students prioritised the sickbay because they believed the responsibility of caring for students goes beyond classroom sessions and that students entrusted unto the care of the school should be in sound health at all times .</p>
      <p>He said the sickbay will be stationed with health personnel, medicines and equipment for emergency care, adding that optimal health of students in school enhances their learning experience.</p>
      <p>He therefore appealed to all past students, parents, individuals, corporate organisations and the Military High Command to support the cause. He also entreated continuing students to join the Association after completion to help contribute their quota to the progress of the school . The Guest speaker of the occasion, Member of Parliament (MP) for La Dadekotopon Constituency and Deputy Minister for Communication, Vincent Sowah Odotei in his speech lauded the FOSA executives for such an initiative to reunite old students to reminisce and share ideas to support the developmental agenda of the school.</p>
      <p>Citing the theme for the celebration, Hon Sowah Odotei said quality education is supported by three key pillars, which are ensuring access to quality teachers, providing the use of quality teaching and learning materials and establishing a safe and conducive environment for students. He urged FOSA to support its alma mater to become a model school in Ghana. He further assured the school authorities that he will redeem his pledge to donate office supplies to the school.</p>
      <p>The Guest of Honor, Commander Support Services Brigade Group, Brig Gen Stanley Brian Alloh said he was glad to share such a memorable event with members of FOSA and to address some of the challenges of the school.</p>
      <p>As part of maintaining discipline in the school , he entreated the school authorities to ensure all first year students join the cadet corps. He also suggested to FOSA executives to conduct Career regular Guidance and Counseling programs to help continuing students in their career paths.</p>
      <p>The Chairperson of the occasion, Col Anita Asmah in her remarks thanked FOSA for the donation of books to stock the library and 100 plastic chairs. She urged the current students to strive for excellence in everything they do, especially in their academics.</p>
      <p>The four day program was characterised by activities such as student craft exhibition, Bon fire and Jama night, health walk, medical screening, food bazaar, live band and climaxed with a thanksgiving service.</p>
