      <h1>McCarthy Takes Danish Journalist To Task Over Question About Irish Quality</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Connaughton</a></address>
      <p>After eight months of buildup it all comes down to this. Ireland's Euro 2020 fate could be sealed tomorrow night, with a win against Denmark in Dublin securing a spot in next summer's championships.</p>
      <p>While we do have the backup of a <a href="https://www.balls.ie/football/ireland-euro-2020-playoff-play-guaranteed-420386">play-off next March</a> should we fail to get three points against the Danes, nobody wants to have to go down that route again.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy has been defiant in the face of criticism throughout the campaign, insisting he knew what he was doing despite a few questionable performances. He admitted that the scenario tomorrow night is one we have jumped at at the start of the group, meaning this is likely the defining game of his second Ireland stint.</p>
      <p>Speaking in his pre-match press conference earlier today, McCarthy admitted that he still feels nerves before big games such as this one. In fact, he welcomes the feeling.</p>

      <blockquote>I've woken up this morning with the butterfly with the boots on.<br/>It’s the day before the big game, and I’m pleased about that to be honest with you.<br/>That nice feeling getting ready for the game and you know that the big game is coming now. And this is the last part of the preparation, I enjoy that feeling.<br/>They don't get any less that's for sure, not at all. Do they get any bigger? It's the one that you're playing in is the biggest one, so this is it.<br/>I hope I'm going to have a bigger one in July when we're playing in bigger games in the European Championships.<br/>For now, this is the biggest one.</blockquote>
      <p>Ireland's task tomorrow may be somewhat complicated by the face that Denmark only need a draw in the game to secure their spot at the Euros. Like the Irish, they are also playing for the chance to take part in a major tournament on home soil.</p>
      <p>The Danes have hardly been the most complimentary towards Ireland in the recent past, openly questioning our style of play and lack of technical ability.</p>
      <p>One Danish journalist raised this point in today's press conference, to which McCarthy gave a typical response.</p>

      <blockquote>Often said by whom (the Danes)? Well that might tell you something. Self-praise is no praise I'm afraid!<br/>I'm not bothered. If I sat here and said I was better than everyone else you wouldn't believe me, would you?<br/>It doesn't concern me, people's opinions don't concern me. It's on the day.<br/>I was a big Leeds fan as a kid, and I remember that cup final against Sunderland (1973). It was an absolute show-in, Sunderland couldn't win. Guess what, they did.<br/>All the games I've seen subsequently or been involved where teams shouldn't win, they've got better players, they've got a better squad, a better manager, everything's in their favour, and they get slapped.<br/>That's what I'm hoping will happen tomorrow.</blockquote>
      <p>There are no fresh injury concerns ahead of the game, with Darren Randolph also fully recovered from his recent spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>With a sell-out crowd expected at the Aviva Stadium, here's hoping for another one of those famous Dublin nights.</p>
