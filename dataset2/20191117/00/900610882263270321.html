      <p>Have you achieved elite status with a US based airline’s frequent flyer programme? If so, you can get added to Southwest Airlines’ A-List tier at no charge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/southwest-will-match-your-elite-status-on-any-us-airlin-1839802506"><b>Lifehacker reports</b></a> that until December 31 Southwest will grant elite-level members at other airlines A-List status within the Rapid Rewards programme.</p>
      <p>The status match lasts for a three-month period, and members can extended this for an additional 12 months by completing three roundtrips (or six one-way flights) within 90 days of confirmation of enrollment.</p>
      <p>Membership in A-List normally requires travellers to accrue 35,000 Rapid Rewards points or to fly 25 one-way flight segments per year.</p>
      <p>Perks include priority boarding and the option of free same-day standby for last-minute flight changes.</p>
      <p>To get A-List status with Southwest, first sign up as a member of the airline’s Rapid Rewards programme, if you have not joined already. You’ll then have to document your elite status at another US airline by providing your frequent flyer number and other information.</p>
      <p>Southwest has an easy-to-use <a href="https://www.southwest.com/html/rapidrewards/promotions/swa_status_match.html?irgwc=1&amp;clickid=V9fxuOVEOxyJTJUwUx0Mo382Ukn1XO0FRyKu280"><b>online application form</b></a> for this.</p>
      <p>If you qualify, approval for A-List is usually granted within 12 days, according to Southwest.</p>
