      <h1>HP A ‘Basket Case’ As PC Sales Slump 16% According To New Research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T00:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/dwr/" target="_blank">David Richards</a></address>
      <p>The Hewlett Packard PC and printer division is facing a torrid time with their PC sales slumping 16% and thousands of staff facing the real risk of being sacked either before or “straight after Xmas” as the #1 PC Company in Australia, struggles to find growth markets claims analysts.</p>
      <p>Globally moral at the big US PC Company who 18 months ago split from the HP Enterprise business is “extremly low” according to insiders that ChannelNews has spoken to.<br/>“Who wants to put any effort in for a Company who think employees are easily disposable” said one employee.</p>
      <p>They added” PC sales are struggling across all brands and HP is a basket case that needs new management if they are to ever succeed”.</p>
      <p>In Australia the US PC Company is losing share to Acer in the education and PC gaming market where capture market share with their Omen PC offering despite heavy online and social media marketing.</p>

      <p>According to DigiTimes research Hewlett-Packard’s (HP) shipments plunged 16% on month in October due to its business restructuring and layoff.</p>
      <p>Lenovo had an over 20% decline in the same month because of China’s weak domestic demand the research revealed.</p>
      <p>Recently Xerox Holdings gave the PC and printer division four weeks to decide, as to whether they will accept a $27 billion-dollar takeover offer.</p>
      <p>The move is seen as audacious however it will bring together two fading stars of technology.<br/>There is no guarantee Xerox will follow through with an offer or that one would succeed.</p>
      <p>HP, which installed a new chief executive earlier this, is more than three times the size of Xerox and any bid would be at a premium to its current stock price.</p>
      <p>Xerox, one of the biggest sellers of photocopiers.</p>
      <p>After blocking Xerox’s planned merger with Fujifilm last year and taking control of its board, activist investor Carl Icahn who has a 10.6% shareholding in Xerox as well as a 4.2% stake in HP is now pushing for a merger with HP, arguing that a union could yield big profits for investors.</p>
      <p>“I think a combination is a no-brainer,” Icahn told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
      <p>“I’ve found over the years that these types of companies that are in shrinking industries tend to decline much more slowly than many markets participants may predict while continuing to generate substantial amounts of cash,” Icahn said.</p>
      <p>In the Australian printer market HP is still holding share.</p>

      <p>The overall Australian printer market recorded 1.84 million-unit shipments in 2018, which was 2.2% less than that of 2017, according to IDC with sales falling even further in 2019.</p>
      <p>Selling volume for both inkjet and laser devices continued to drop, reported at -1.8% and -3.0% year-over-year (YoY) respectively.</p>
      <p>However, the shipment of colour laser multi-function products offered a slightly brighter spot in the shrinking market, with an annual growth at 6.8%</p>
      <p>Among the inkjet vendors, HP had strengthened its position by increasing the occupancy rate on entry-level printers while Canon’s market share slumped.</p>
      <p>In the laser market, Brother and HP continued to be the leaders, Fuji Xerox decided to exit the lower-end A4 printer market due to decreasing demand.</p>
