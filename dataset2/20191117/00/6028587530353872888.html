      <p>European Christmas markets make the holiday season special, especially if you can combine these festive events with a high-end river cruise. A pretty perfect way to get a taste of several markets. <a href="https://www.crystalcruises.com/experience/river">Crystal River Cruises</a>, the brand I consider to be the most luxurious I’ve experienced on European rivers, offers <a href="https://www.crystalcruises.com/theme-cruises/christmas-markets">Christmas-themed voyages</a> along the Rhine, Main, Danube and Moselle Rivers.</p>
      <p>The weather may be cold, but it’s worth bundling up at least once in your life to take advantage of the winter break and experience dazzling lights displays, mulled wine, traditional cookies and cakes, bonfires, local gifts, games and spectacles – plus the pleasures of the historic European cities and towns.</p>
      <p>Whether you snag a last-minute holiday reservation this year or plan for the next, here are a few Christmas market highlights to expect. (And I follow with an analysis of my earlier Crystal river cruise.)</p>
      <p>In <b><i>Deggendorf</i></b>, Germany, Vilshofen’s cobbled lanes lead to an unusual Floating Christmas Market on the Danube (<i>Schwimmender Christkindlmarkt</i>), featuring decorative objects and traditional handicraft, in stalls along the riverbank. A massive wooden nativity scene sits atop a ship, serving culinary delicacies.</p>
      <p>In <b><i>Vienna</i></b>, Austria you can meander through the sprawling <i>Rathausplatz </i>Christmas Market, where <i>Wiener Chriskindl </i>(Christ Child) is traditionally portrayed by a young woman with flowing blonde curls.</p>
      <p><b><i>Salzburg</i></b>, Austria’s Christmas Markets invite guests to stroll along festively decorated lanes, savoring Christmas cookies and traditional mulled wine during a visit to the famous <i>Stiftskeller</i> St. Peter (St. Peter's Beer Cellar). Located in St. Peter's Abbey and dating back to 803, it is perhaps the world's oldest restaurant.</p>

      <p><b><i>Cesky Krumlov</i></b>, Czech Republic is famous for a Christmas Market where you can design your own cookie at a special gingerbread workshop.</p>
      <p>Visiting the biggest and oldest <i>Christkindlesmarkt</i> of them all in <b><i>Nuremberg</i></b>, Germany, dating back to 1628, you can drink mulled <i>glühwein</i> as you navigate hundreds of market stalls.</p>

      <p>In <b><i>Budapest</i></b>, Hungary the Budapest Christmas Fair and Winter Festival on Vörösmarty Square is filled with scents of traditional honey cookies, poppyseed cake, cinnamon and roasting chestnuts.</p>

      <p>In <b><i>Passau</i></b>, Germany, enjoy a midday Advent concert at St. Stephen’s Cathedral played with an 18,000-pipe organ.</p>
      <p>In <b><i>Basel</i></b>, Switzerland, venture through market stalls decorated like mountain chalets, and taste chocolate and melted Raclette cheese treats.</p>
      <p>In rustic <b><i>Breisach</i></b>, Germany – the land of the cuckoo clock and Black Forest Cake – you’ll be warmed by an authentic yuletide bonfire.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>As you enjoy all this festivity, you’ll be returning to the quiet comforts of your river boat, usually docked a short walk from the markets.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year I cruised from Amsterdam along the Rhine and Moselle to Germany and Luxembourg and back to Amsterdam on the Crystal Bach.</p>

      <p>Although I’ve enjoyed more exotic itineraries, this cruise was the most luxurious I’ve experienced on a river. Some reasons:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Accommodations</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even though we were on a river boat, the Crystal Bach’s guest accommodations rivaled those of an ocean-going cruise ship, with a spacious marble bathroom, walk-in closet, high-tech amenities, a king-size bed facing a huge window, and butler service.</p>

      <p>And there were a mix of suites to accommodate varying levels of participants.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Food and Wine</b>
      </p>
      <p>The level was Michelin-inspired, with farm-to-table dining in multiple open-seating dining venues, with choices including local specialties and classics like Maine lobster, caviar, fresh Dover sole, and foie gras.</p>
      <p>I happened to mention to a server that I loved white asparagus, and even though it was late in the season, the next night it appeared at my table: a delicious, thoughtful surprise.</p>

      <p>The Vintage Room dining experience featured wine pairings of rare vintages accompanied by a gourmet meal specially chosen for the occasion. The all-inclusive plan including unlimited fine wines, premium spirits, champagne and beers, and unlimited dining.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Staff</b>
      </p>
      <p>Crystal offers the highest staff-to-guest ratio among all European river cruise lines, with complimentary gratuities for shipboard and shoreside staff. From the moment I was picked up at the airport until the last minute onboard, I was treated as a special guest, with exemplary, personal service.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Entertainment and Activities</b>
      </p>
      <p>On board entertainment was low-key but special. Some local talent was brought on board, and one night we were taken to a village concert. But the charming duo, Joe and Liv, kept us eager to attend evening performances.</p>

      <p>What I noted: Enrichment and wellness programs including a full-service, well-appointed spa. Destination experts curated complimentary shoreside experiences. A fleet of private luxury motor coaches, with Wi-Fi and power outlets, accompanied each ship for the duration of the voyage.</p>
      <p>Crystal Cruise Lines offers quiet luxury, for a price. No bling, subdued colors. Not many daytime activities on board. But for a discerning traveler, this is the ultimate river experience, whether in the holiday season or any time.</p>
