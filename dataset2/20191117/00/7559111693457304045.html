      <p><b>REVIEW</b> – Over the past year, I have tested and reviewed a few security cameras and with a few exceptions, I have been pleased with them. Recently, there were a few accidents on the street in front of my home and I decided that it would be nice to have a camera facing the street. Keep in mind that I live 5 stories up and I want a camera that I can mount outside of a window. I need it to be 100% wireless so that during the winter I will not lose heat from inside my home nor will I let in cold air because I have to leave a window slightly open to run wires to the camera. The Soliom Solar Security Camera may just be what I am looking for.</p>

All features provide a reliable and clear 24/7 continuous outdoor home or office security.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the front of the camera, there is the lens and the infrared LEDs. There are all protected by a clear weatherproof cover.</p>

      <p>Underneath the camera, there is a speaker and a compartment the has a rubber/silicone sealing cover. In that compartment, there is the micro SD card slot, the power and reset buttons and the USB port for charging.</p>

      <p>On top of the camera, there are the 3 solar panels that can be spread out as shown below. The two end panels can be lowered to each side or raised to be flat with the top.</p>

      <h4>Performance</h4>
      <p>The camera arrived in a box with good protection. Setting up the hardware is very easy. The solar panels are already installed so you just have to screw in the antennas, install the micro SD card which has to be formatted as FAT32, and attach the base mount. Once I finished assembling the hardware, I removed the silicone sealing cover from the bottom and used the micro USB cable to charge the built-in battery. I charged it for more than the recommended 12 hours. Once charged, I powered it on and it gave me a voice command confirmation that it was ready to be paired. I opened the app and selected “add a device” and was greeted by a loud pinging sound. My network offers both 2.4ghz and 5ghz wireless connectivity, so as far as I was concerned, I was good to go. The camera gave another voice command that it had received the pairing information and there was a display in the app showing the progress. as the loud pinging sound continued. The instructions indicate that you should set the volume on your phone top the loudest during the setup process.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Soliom-18.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Once the progress indicator reached 100%, it moved to the following screen:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Soliom-19.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I selected ok and it displayed the following troubleshooting screen:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Soliom-20.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I discovered that the camera needs 2.4ghz wifi that is available by itself. It was not able to connect to my router that broadcasts both at 2.4ghz and 5ghz. Since I have a sizeable number of wireless devices on my network that uses both frequencies, I did not want to disable the 5ghz to test. Instead, I added a separate 2.4ghz wireless access point to my network and finally, the camera connected and the rest was easy. I was able to select the device, create a password, choose the region and I was good to go.</p>

        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Soliom-21.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>After I inserted the micro SD card, it was time to mount the camera onto an existing Air Conditioner bracket that I have installed outside of my window. As you can see in the picture below, the camera mount cannot bend to a 90-degree angle, which is how I wanted and needed to mount it. Since I live in a building, I have to abide by the rules that do not allow me to mount anything directly to the surface of the building.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Soliom-11.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I decided to use the mount as a way to wire strap it to the bracket. Since I do not really need access to the speaker at 5 stories up, I installed it flat onto the bracket.</p>

      <p>
        <b>App</b>
      </p>
      <p>The camera footage has to be viewed via the app. Although it is meant to be mounted at about 8 feet high and would most likely be used to view someone approaching a house, I think it does a remarkable job at providing clear footage at 5 stories high and even in overcast conditions. It does get a bit blurry when I zoom in but keep in mind that the street is over 100 feet away. I can also recognize most of what is in view when looking even at night. The only issue I encounter is when I switch from SD to HD mode which seems to introduce a bit of stop and go footage. I have very good bandwidth so I may move the access point closer to see if improved signal strength solves this issue.<br/>All of the snapshots of the views shown below were taken during very overcast conditions.<br/><b>View in portrait mode:</b></p>

      </figure>
      <p>The app also shows the date and time, battery charge level, and wireless signal strength. The camera does provide an audible warning via the app whenever it detects movement. In my case, this only occurs once in a while because of where it is mounted. Also, there is the option to record to the installed memory card or to the cloud. The cloud storage is free for up to 20 clips per day. The following screenshot from the app shows the settings screen that includes the option to switch between the SD card and the Cloud.</p>

        <b>Important notes:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It only works with a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi router. Does not work with 5Ghz Wi-Fi</li>
        <li>It only works with the Soliom app and software. Other third-party apps not supported</li>
        <li>The PIR for S90 solar camera is a rectangle one that has a larger motion sensitivity area from left to right but narrows the motion area from the upper top to the ground so that it’s more sensitive to side-to-side movement than movement heading straight toward the camera.</li>
        <li>The PIR range is about 16ft.</li>
        <li>Do not expose the camera to any weather with the silicone flap open</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I like</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The build quality</li>
        <li>The truly wireless connectivity</li>
        <li>The weatherproof design</li>
        <li>The built-in solar panel that provides a continuous charge</li>
        <li>The video quality</li>
        <li>The pinch/zoom capability of the app</li>
        <li>The ease of installation once you have the isolated 2.4ghz wireless availability</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What I’d change</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow for 5ghz wireless connectivity (Not sure what this entails from a technical design perspective)</li>
        <li>Allow for a base mount with better mounting options (angles)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>This Soliom Security Camera is quite large for what we see in security cameras on the market today, but justifiably so because of the solar panels that keep the battery charged even on an overcast day. This is great since absolutely no cabling or changing of batteries is required. The quality of the video even in SD resolution is very good. I also like the HD quality of course, but there may be some challenges with HD depending on the wireless signal strength which has the 2.4ghz restriction. The 2-way audio is also great, and even though I am using it perched 5 stories in the air, I can still hear the street traffic and some human dialogue at probably 100 feet away. In my opinion, this is a great security camera for the price. Great bang for the buck$$.</p>
