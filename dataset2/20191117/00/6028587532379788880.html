      <p>Hours prior to Lionel Messi’s dead ball hat trick at the expense of Celta Vigo last Saturday, the big news to break out of FC Barcelona was that club president Josep Bartomeu had reveales plans to offer the five-time Ballon d’Or winner an indefinite contract. ‘I always make a comparison with Pelé,’ explained Bartomeu in an interview with the Associated Press. ‘Pelé was a man from only one club [in Brazil]... [and] I have no doubt that after Messi ends his career as a footballer, he will remain linked to this club for the rest of his life.'</p>
      <p>‘Leo Messi's contract ends in 2021. But it will surely be the will of all parties involved, if they feel strong and ambitious, to extend this contract indefinitely,’ finished Bartomeu emphatically on the matter.</p>
      <p>Now, in his own sit-down chat this weekend with one of Catalonia’s two main newspapers SPORT, director of football Eric Abidal has confirmed that the wheels are in motion to tie the Argentine to the Blaugrana for the rest of his days.</p>
      <p>‘For us he is a key player. He has this option to leave on his contract [when it expires], but I know that the president is talking to his representatives to close the case once and for all,’ Abidal confirmed.</p>
      <p>‘I hope he stays for many years and I think it will be that way. It will be Leo's decision. And, as he says, Barça [is] first and foremost. He is the best,’ claimed Abidal, of a star he featured alongside on the pitch himself during the golden years of Pep Guardiola’s ‘Tiki-taka’ dynasty.</p>
      <p>Additionally confirming that getting La Masia wonderkid Ansu Fati to pen a new deal is another of his chief concerns, Abidal was also probed on the club’s obligation to deliver silverware.</p>
      <p>‘We are Barça and we have to win everything here. We have a clear demand because this is the same year after year,’ Abidal admitted.</p>
      <p>According to the Frenchman, who lifted 18 titles in his storied career including the Champions League twice, mentality is key. ‘I do not speak of squad members and only of mentality,' said Abidal. 'In sport that is what makes the difference. If the team has the mentality to achieve this goal, it will achieve it. And I am one of those who am convinced that it has it.’</p>
      <p>Even still, the World Cup finalist, who has recently completed a scouting mission to unearth the stars of tomorrow in Brazil, believes that the first team squad has better tools at its disposal than in 2018/2019. Then, Barça clinched the La Liga title comfortably, but fell tragically short at the semi-final stage on the continent.</p>
      <p>‘This squad is better than last season. When you add players, you not only add talent but also personality,’ said Abidal. ‘All the signings we have made, plus the boys that have climbed [up] from the lower [youth] categories have personality and are going to help us on and off the field.’</p>
      <p>Should they fail to do so, it is likely that Abidal’s top priority in the summer will be landing reinforcements and procuring a replacement to the under fire Valverde. At present, Holland’s Ronald Koeman and Marcelo Gallardo of Riverplate have been earmarked as the most likely candidates to succeed him.</p>
