      <p>“Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, DC, to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.</p>
      <p>According to the White House, Trump had a quick medical exam and some lab work done as he had a free weekend.</p>
      <p>“The President remains healthy and energetic without complaints, as demonstrated by his repeated vigorous rally performances in front of thousands of Americans several times a week,” Grisham said.</p>
      <p>The unscheduled trip to Walter Reed prompted doubt from some of the president’s critics on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Grisham fought back against the rumors on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Seems to be a lot more fun for people/some reporters to speculate &amp; spread irresponsible/dangerous rumors,” she wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Grisham also appeared on Fox News to explain the trip, ironically thanking CNN’s Brian Stelter for sharing the clip on Twitter.</p>

      <p>The president also shared details about the trip on Twitter, where he also visited a family of a soldier having major surgery at Walter Reed Medical Center.</p>
      <p>“Those are truly some of the best doctors anywhere in the world,” Trump wrote.</p>

      <p>Unscheduled presidential visits to Walter Reed are not uncommon.</p>
      <p>In December 2014, President Barack Obama made an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/06/politics/obama-sore-throat/index.html">unscheduled visit </a>to the hospital for a “routine CT scan” for a sore throat.</p>
