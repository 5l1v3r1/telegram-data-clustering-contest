      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) — After 58 days behind picket lines, workers at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia have reached a tentative agreement to end the strike.</p>
      <p>According to a spokesperson for the hotel, the tentative deal was reached Saturday, after a 29-hour bargaining session.</p>
      <p>“The Hotel has implemented a workplace safety program that the Union has called ‘industry-leading’ and includes programs specifically designed to prevent harassment and discrimination and empower our employees around these issues. Rosewood Hotel Georgia has now become the first Union-represented hotel in Vancouver to broadly install panic buttons covering the majority of employees across multiple departments,” says a news release issued Sunday.</p>

      <p>Worker safety was one of the main sticking points during contract talks that spanned nine months</p>
      <p>In August, some female employees <a href="https://www.uniteherelocal40.org/2019/08/press-release-female-staff-report-pervasive-sexual-harassment-at-iconic-hotel-georgia/">filed a human rights complaint</a>, claiming the top-rated hotel allowed “certain female staff to be treated in derogatory and discriminatory manner.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this fall 1,500 workers from five luxury Vancouver hotels went on strike.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 15, workers from the Westin Bayshore, Hyatt Regency, Pinnacle Harbourfront, and Four Seasons hotels struck a deal and went back to work.</p>
