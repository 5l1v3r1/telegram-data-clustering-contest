        <b>Chukwudi Akasike, Yenagoa</b>
      </p>
      <p>On a day many stakeholders gathered at the office of the Independent National Electoral Commission in Yenagoa, a group of boat operators besieged the office demanding payment for a job that had been executed.</p>
      <p>The boat operators, who were about six in number, expressed dissatisfaction that none of the INEC administrative officers were attending to their plight.</p>
      <p>One of them, who identified himself simply as John, said he had been on the waterways for three days, moving INEC’s men and materials to the riverine areas for the purpose of the governorship election.</p>
      <p>He lamented that they had spent the third day on the waterways without being with their families, adding that INEC should not keep them longer than necessary in Yenagoa before they return to their families.</p>
      <p>”We have been moving INEC people and voting materials through the waterways for the past three days. Now, election has ended and we expected that we should be paid.</p>
      <p>”I tried entering inside there (hall), but one man at the door was pushing me back. Is it fair? That is not fair,” John told our Correspondent.</p>
      <p>Another boat driver, who does not want his name mentioned, explained that he was neither a party agent nor a politician, but a boat driver that came to collect his pay after delivering his service for INEC.</p>
      <p>”I am not leaving Yenagoa until they pay me my money.</p>
      <p>“Since Thursday, I have been moving from Yenagoa to riverine areas. Now that I have finished the work, I think it is only necessary that I get paid,” the visibly angry boat driver said.</p>
