      <p>A manhunt is underway after a machete-wielding gang burst into a house and tried to stab a 13-year-old girl to death.</p>
      <p>The teenager is in a critical but stable condition in hospital following the horrific incident at 9.15pm last night.</p>
      <p>The schoolgirl suffered several serious wounds in the attack after a number of males forced their way into a house in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Police are treating it as attempted murder.</p>
      <p>A woman was also stabbed in the leg, while a baby nearby was unharmed, reports <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/lisnaskea-attempted-murder-incident-leaves-17270524">Belfast Live.</a></p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: “Police received a report at around 9.15pm that a number of males, armed with machetes, had forced entry to a house and attacked two female occupants.</p>
      <p>"A 13 year old girl sustained serious stab wounds as a result and was taken to hospital where she remains in a critical but stable condition.</p>

      <p>"A 41-year old woman was also treated for stab wounds to her leg but has since been discharged from hospital. A baby was also present at the scene but was thankfully unharmed."  <br/><br/>DS Monaghan has appealed for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>He added: “This must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved and we are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>"We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on.</p>
      <p>The number to call is 101 and the reference number is 1650 16/11/19.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”</p>
