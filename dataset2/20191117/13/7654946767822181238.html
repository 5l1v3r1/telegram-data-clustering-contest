      <h1>Jets vs. Redskins prediction, line: Bet against Dwayne Haskins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:01:01+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Blezow</a></address>
      <p>There are no easy games for the Jets, and as Yogi Berra might have said, Sunday at Washington is one of them.</p>
      <p>The Jets beat the Giants, 34-27, in the Game of the Weak. But even while holding Saquon Barkley to 1 yard rushing to go along with six sacks and Jamal Adams’ pickpocket-six, the Jets still yielded four touchdown passes to Daniel Jones and looked to be headed for defeat before coming through with a strong fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>They are in the softest part of their schedule now, with games against the 1-8 Redskins, 0-9 Bengals and 2-7 Dolphins surrounding next week’s home date with the 5-4 Raiders. If Sam Darnold still thinks the Jets have a shot to make the playoffs — playoffs?! — they clearly have to run the table in this stretch. And that is a tall task given all the backups, waiver pickups and practice-squad players they are using on the offensive line and in the defensive backfield.</p>
      <p>The line shows oddsmakers don’t rate the Jets appreciably higher than the Redskins, who are averaging 7.5 ppg over their past six games, but have a professional defense led by Ryan Kerrigan, Jonathan Allen and Josh Norman.</p>
      <p>So this is more a lean to the Jets than a confident choice, but here’s why: The Jets lead the NFL in average yards per rush on defense (3.0). If they can stay strong there, it will force Dwayne Haskins to the air in just his second career start. Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams should be able to scheme the rookie quarterback into a few mistakes that turn the outcome in a close matchup.</p>
      <p><b>The pick:</b> Jets, +1¹/₂.</p>
      <p><b>Dallas Cowboys (-4¹/₂) over DETROIT LIONS:</b> This line is off the board at most sportsbooks due to the uncertainty of Matthew Stafford. The Bettor’s Guide is using the number posted at Circa in Las Vegas, which surely will rise if Stafford can’t go. Whether he plays with broken bones in his back or Jeff Driskel steps in again, have to go with the Cowboys and their 27.9 ppg offense.</p>

      <p><b>TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS (+5¹/₂) over New Orleans Saints:</b> If you predicted the Bucs would be averaging 28.9 ppg to the Saints’ 22.7 entering Week 11, take a bow. Yes, Drew Brees has been out for much of it, but his return has not led to a parade to the end zone. Hoping to get the Good Jameis Winston one more time.</p>
      <p><b>Atlanta Falcons (+5) over CAROLINA PANTHERS:</b> This is such a “sandwich game,” it should be on the menu at Jersey Mike’s. Panthers laid it all out there at Lambeau but couldn’t beat the Packers (or the refs), and next week they travel to New Orleans. Falcons can hang in or get a back-door cover here.</p>
      <p><b>Jacksonville Jaguars (+3) over INDIANAPOLIS COLTS:</b> This is the toss-up of the week, as the home-team-minus-3 spread suggests. Nick Foles returns for the Jags and Jacoby Brissett should be back for the Colts, albeit likely without T.Y. Hilton. Taking the points with Jags, who are 7-0-1 ATS in the past eight in this series.</p>
      <p><b>Denver Broncos (+10¹/₂) over MINNESOTA VIKINGS:</b> This could be a look-ahead spot for the Vikings — not to a tough opponent but to their long-awaited bye. They are coming off a prime-time win in Dallas and are a bit battered. This shapes up as a difficult game against the Broncos, who are rested off their bye.</p>
      <p><b>MIAMI DOLPHINS (+6¹/₂) over Buffalo Bills:</b> Miami has covered five games in a row, including a 31-21 loss at Buffalo as 17-point underdogs. Even that score was deceiving, as the Bills returned a late onside kick for a touchdown. More Fitzmagic, please!</p>
      <p><b>Houston Texans (+4) over BALTIMORE RAVENS:</b> Baltimore and Lamar Jackson are absolutely rolling with five wins in a row, the past three by at least two touchdowns. The Texans really looked as if they figured it all out in their rout of the Jags in London, and come in off a bye ready to slug it out.</p>
      <p><b>Arizona Cardinals (+10¹/₂) over SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS:</b> It’s a short week for the 49ers off a full 70-minute heartbreaker versus Seattle on Monday night. They are without top offensive weapon George Kittle again, and beat the Cardinals by just three points on Halloween night in Arizona.</p>
      <p><b>New England Patriots (-3¹/₂) over PHILADELPHIA EAGLES:</b> This column loves underdogs, particularly the Eagles as underdogs. Yet in this one instance, just can’t resist the Patriots off a bye following a blowout loss in Baltimore, with a still-boiling revenge motive for their Super Bowl LII loss to Philadelphia.</p>
      <p><b>OAKLAND RAIDERS (-10¹/₂) over Cincinnati Bengals:</b> Cincinnati has to drag its 0-9 carcass cross-country after a 49-13 loss in Baltimore. That can’t be fun. Raiders’ largest margin of victory this season is just eight points, but this looks to be a game in which they can run away.</p>
      <p><b>Chicago Bears (+6¹/₂) over LOS ANGELES RAMS:</b> Jared Goff had the worst game of his career in a 15-6 loss at Soldier Field last December. The rematch is at home, but the Rams again will be without Brandin Cooks (which will allow the Bears to double Cooper Kupp) and their offensive line is a shambles. Khalil Mack has only one sack in the past five games, but will come alive here.</p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p><b>Los Angeles Chargers (+3¹/₂) over Kansas City Chiefs:</b> In the high altitude of Mexico City, the first thought is it will be tough for the Chargers to keep up with the speed of the Chiefs. But KC’s defense has been so bad, particularly against the run, that LA should be able to pound away, keep a tired unit on the field and Patrick Mahomes off it.</p>
      <p><b>Best bets:</b> Bears, Cardinals, Chargers.<br/><b>Lock of the week:</b> Bears (Locks 4-6 in 2019).<br/><b>Last week:</b> 8-4-1 overall, 3-0 Best Bets.<br/><b>Thursday:</b> Steelers (L).</p>
