      <p>Attention John Waters' fans: Tickets for the filthiest weekender on the planet, <a href="https://events.com/r/en_US/event/camp-john-waters-2020-kent-september-772889">Camp John Waters</a> in Kent, Connecticut, are about to go on sale. This will be the camp's fourth year and it promises to be even "dirtier, raunchier," and "filthier" than ever. Activities include: A costume contest (judged by the "Pope of Trash" himself); themed dance parties; a film marathon (of Waters' movies, of course); a meet &amp; greet with Waters; <i>Hairspray </i>karaoke, and Bloody Mary bingo. But, wait, there's more. This year's camp counselors are Kathleen Turner, Patty Hearst <i>and</i> Mink Stole — making for a mini-<i>Serial Mom</i> reunion.</p>
      <p>It's a disgrace that I have not yet made the pilgrimage to this filthy fête for grownups. But friends of mine have been and rave about it.</p>
      <p>If <i>you </i>want to get your trash on next September (11-14), <a href="https://events.com/r/en_US/event/camp-john-waters-2020-kent-september-772889">buy your tickets to Camp John Waters now</a>. They are already on sale and are sure to sell out.</p>
