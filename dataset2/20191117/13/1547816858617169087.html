The 77-year-old actor has carved his niche and has won many hearts.

      <p>The filmmaker also shared that he received a reply to the notice only from T-Series but it was ‘very vague.’ The Hyderabad filmmaker further told IANS that as he was cheated and criminally frightened by the makers of the film, he is planning to move to the court to stop the screening of the movie in theatres, television and all digital platforms.</p>

      <p>According to filmmaker Nandi, he had purchased the exclusive rights to make a movie on the life of slum soccer player Akhilesh Paul, who was the Indian captain at the Homeless World Cup in 2017.  As Kumar had planned to write and direct the multilingual film titled ‘Slum Soccer’ on the life of Paul, born in the slums of Nagpur and a drug addict and his story, the movie maker claimed to have registered his story and script with Telangana Cinema Writers Association on June 11, 2018.</p>

      <p>Nagaraj Manjule’s film is based on the life of Paul’s coach, Vijay Barse, the film Jhund will also have Akhilesh’s life as a major part in the film, supposedly violating the copyrights. With Kumar not receiving the required reply to this issue from Amitabh Bachchan or Director Nagraj, filmmaker Nandi has officially written to India Movie Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) and Telangana Cinema Writers Association and insisted on the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) not to issue censor certificate to the film Jhund.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i>Image source: Instagram/ Amitabh Bachchan</i></p>
