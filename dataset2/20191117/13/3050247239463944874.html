      <h1>Crypto Platform Celsius Network Reaches $4.25 Billion in Total Loans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:28:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Cryptocurrency platform Celsius Network announced that it reached $4.25 billion in total crypto loan origination as of Nov. 12 in a press release shared with Cointelegraph.</p>
      <p>Celsius reached $4.25 billion of cryptocurrency loans since the start of its activity in July 2018 calculated at current Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) prices, a 93% increase from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-celsius-is-the-fastest-growing-crypto-lender-22b-in-loans">the $2.2 billion reported on Aug. 1, 2019</a>.</p>
      <h3>A fast-growing lending network</h3>
      <p>The company also claims $450 million in customer deposits and collateral from loans under management, which represents a 50% increase from $300 million on Aug. 1 this year.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Celsius also reveals it paid its users $5 million in interest payments or 66% more than the $3 million paid by Aug. 1. The firm’s CEO Alex Mashinksy said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Celsius gives back 80% of loan interest to our depositors with no minimums, caps, fees or penalties — our incredible growth shows there is high demand for lending platforms that put the needs of depositors first.”</blockquote>
      <p>The company also claims to have over 50,000 users from over 150 countries and that over 150 institutions are amongst its customers. </p>
      <h3>A quickly developing but unregulated industry</h3>
      <p>The latest data shows that the nascent cryptocurrency lending industry is growing rapidly. Additionally, a recently Q3 report <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/genesis-capital-crypto-lending-firm-reports-870m-in-new-originations-in-q3">released</a> by institutional digital asset lending firm Genesis Capital revealed that the platform added $870 million in new originations during the quarter.</p>
      <p>Still, some uncertainties remain as to how crypto lending should be regulated. As Cointelegraph recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/intl-bank-regulator-is-studying-crypto-lending-capital-requirements">reported</a>, global banking regulator Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is currently studying how much capital lenders should hold to cover the risks generated by dealing with cryptocurrencies.</p>
