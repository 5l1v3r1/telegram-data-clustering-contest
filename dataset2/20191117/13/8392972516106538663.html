      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> think they know how Sharon Mitchell will get out of Lisa Fowler telling Phil the baby isn't his - and it's cruel.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night's episode Sharon panicked when Lisa accused her of murdering Mel to keep her from telling Phil that he isn't the father.</p>
      <p>Of course viewers know he isn't the father - Keanu is - but Lisa doesn't know that and so made this accusation in front of Phil, Louise and Keanu.</p>
      <p>She said: "Is that Mel's blood on your hands? Mel followed you to the airport to tell Phil, didn't she? It was the only way for you to shut her up.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"You killed her. Because that baby isn't yours and that's why Mel's dead."</p>
      <p>She also told Phil: "I'm telling the truth Phil, Mel found out and that's why she's dead."</p>
      <p>Mel actually died after walking in front of a truck when she heard her dead son Hunter's voice.</p>
      <p>Sharon ended up screaming at Lisa to get out of her house but she'll soon have to come up with a way of convincing Phil to ignore what Lisa said - and fans reckon they know how.</p>

      <p>They are convinced Sharon is going to use Lisa's mental health issues against her and have her sectioned.</p>
      <p>One said: "Sharon will convince everyone thatâ€™s Lisaâ€™s losing it again and try and get her sectioned again. #Eastenders @bbceastenders".</p>
      <p>A second said: "She's gonna get Lisa sectioned ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ #EastEnders".</p>
      <p>Fans fears could be well founded after all Sharon is going to have to go to extreme lengths to keep her and Keanu's secret before it explodes on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Boss Kate Oates promised: "That's a really big drive through autumn, and then it's going to be a massive story at Christmas.</p>
      <p>"And what I like about it is all of the fall out, if I asked you to guess the fall out now, you wouldn't guess what we've got."</p>
      <p>Exciting!</p>
