      <h1>Friends reunion in the works for HBO Max</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:03:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Idato</a></address>
      <p>A cast reunion for the hit comedy <i>Friends</i>, which has been teased for more than a decade, may finally be on the cards. Sadly, it would not be for a scripted one-off as many fans are hoping, but rather an “unscripted” reunion which would most likely take the form of a round-table look back at the show and its success.</p>
      <p>The project is in development at the streaming platform HBO Max but would, in Australia, likely be offered to broadcasters via traditional TV distribution.</p>

      <p>The plan reportedly has the blessing of the six original castmembers of the show, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, and series creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman. US trade media report the deal is “far from done” but that for the first time all of the key stakeholders have signalled their willingness to participate.</p>
      <h3>Amorosi, Donovan in Eurovision battle</h3>

      <p>Australia’s head of Eurovision delegation (and telecast producer) Paul Clarke said the pair were “two of the most respected voices in the country [and] we can’t wait to hear them at <i>Eurovision: Australia Decides</i> on the Gold Coast”. <i>Eurovision: Australia Decides</i> will be held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre on Febuary 7 and 8, hosted by comedian Joel Creasey and broadcaster Myf Warhurst and broadcast on SBS.</p>
      <h3>World on Fire again</h3>
      <p>You enjoyed World War II? Now enjoy the sequel. The war drama <i>World on Fire</i> has been renewed for a second season, the BBC and ITV Studios have confirmed.</p>
      <p>The series stars Helen Hunt, Sean Bean, Arthur Darvill and Lesley Manville and followed the lives of a number of people across Europe who were swept up in the events leading up to and the opening months of the Second World War.</p>
      <p>The series writer Peter Bowker said he had planned storylines for the characters that would span several seasons. “If you pitch a show, people will often ask, what happens in series four, episode three? What happens to this character?’ You’ve got to know,” he said. The second season would likely air in 2021.</p>

      <h3>Off-screen turmoil for Days of Our Lives</h3>
      <p>In the sort of dramatic twist you’d expect from in front of the camera on a daytime soap, the cast of the long-running US sudser <i>Days of Our Lives</i> has been released from their contracts, sending the show onto an unplanned filming break which will likely stretch into the new year.</p>
      <p>The pause comes as the show’s US network NBC is still hammering out a new contract with Corday Productions, which produces the series for Sony Television.</p>
      <p>The filming schedule is sufficiently advanced that it means there will be no impact to the broadcast schedule for the show, however there may be some glitches when it comes time to re-sign the cast in the new year. <i>Days</i> has notched up more than 13,000 episodes since 1965 and is in its 55th season. The series airs on Foxtel in Australia.</p>
      <h3>Griffiths joins The Wilds</h3>
      <p>Australian actress Rachel Griffiths has been signed to star in <i>The Wilds</i>, a new drama series from Amazon Prime Video. The series, which is pitched at a young adult audience, is described as “part survival drama, part [dystopian] slumber party”.</p>
      <p>Griffiths will play Gretchen Klein, a woman described as “an ambitious intellectual” who runs an all-girl retreat whose airborne adventure goes awry when they become stranded on a deserted island after their plane make an emergency landing.</p>
      <p>The series comes from Sarah Streicher and Amy B. Harris. “Coming of age is not for the faint of heart [and] <i>The Wilds</i> grew from that notion,” Streicher says, adding that the series will “explore teenage-hood in all of its perils, joys and heartbreaks”.</p>
      <h3>Gervais back as Globes host for final time</h3>
      <p>Ricky Gervais has signed on as host of the <i>77th annual Golden Globe Awards</i>. But the British comedian promises it will be his last booking for the gig, and warned that he may go off script.</p>
      <p>“Once again, they’ve made me an offer I can’t refuse,” he said. “But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening.”</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that televised awards nights have a history of celebrity hosts, the Golden Globes historically refrained from the tradition until 2010 when Gervais hosted.</p>
      <p>Gervais returned in 2011 and 2012 before handing over to Tina Fey and Amy Poehler for three years. He returned again in 2016 and since then it has been hosted by Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh.</p>
      <p>“When Ricky Gervais is at the helm of the Golden Globes Awards we can always expect the unexpected,” the head of the Hollywood Foreign Press, Lorenzo Soria, said.</p>
