      <p>Network Ten has secured its biggest revenue share since the Big Bash League was on the free-to-air broadcaster's screens in 2018, with the CBS owned broadcaster receiving a quarter of advertising dollars in October.</p>
      <p>The growth in the Ten's commercial television metropolitan ad market share largely came at the expense of rival Seven West Media, which secured 34.5 per cent over the month compared to<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p532cn.html"> a winning 41.9 per cent in September</a> and 35.5 per cent the year before.</p>

      <p>The October result was the lowest share for Seven since January 2018 but monthly data can be volatile and Seven grew its share over the July to September quarter to 39 per cent.</p>
      <p>Seven chief executive James Warburton took over from Tim Worner three months ago and has<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p533av.html"> committed to a shake-up of the network's shows</a> in 2020 to attract audiences back to the broadcaster after a series of programming flops.</p>
      <p>Nine Entertainment Co, owner of <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i>, took out the biggest revenue share for the month at 40.5 per cent, up from 38.4 per cent in September and 39.7 per cent in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Ten's result was influenced by the launch of reality TV show <i>The Masked Singer </i>and the Rugby World Cup tournament, which largely took place during the month. The network was narrowly up year-on-year, recording a 24.8 per cent share in October 2018 but significantly up from 19.7 per cent in September.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p539o1.html">weak advertising market</a> has weighed on all broadcasters' earnings this year and Ten has had a difficult year after creating a new in-house sales team and repositioning the brand to media buyers.</p>
      <p>The NRL Grand Final on Nine was in October rather than September this year.</p>
      <p>Network Ten chief sales officer Rod Prosser said there had been growth in ratings and revenue share year-on-year.</p>

      <p>"We’ve had great momentum in the second half with shows like <i>Australian Survivor, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette</i> and<i> The Masked Singer</i> all drawing strong audiences, particularly in the demos," he said.</p>
      <p>"The signs are looking good for the coming months, particularly following our multi-platform coverage of the 2019 Melbourne Cup Carnival, and as we move into 2020."</p>
      <p>It was Ten's highest revenue share since the network had Big Bash League, sources close to the network said, but rival media sources warned Ten's lack of major sports rights over the summer period could put pressure on the broadcaster's market share.</p>
      <p>Seven is expected to have an increase in revenue after Test cricket starts on Thursday with Australia versus Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Sources close to Seven said the network was predicting an overall 38.5 per cent to 39 per cent share from July to December, with this share to be maintained from January to June.</p>
      <p>Nine declined to comment.</p>
