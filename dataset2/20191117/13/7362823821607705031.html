      <p>Authorities in northern <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/illinois">Illinois</a> are searching for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons">missing teenage girl</a> who was last seen leaving her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/high-school">high school</a> in neighboring <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> on Wednesday, according to officials.</p>
      <p>The Lake County <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Sheriff's Office</a> said in a news release that 16-year-old Emma Roberts was last seen leaving school in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest">Salem, Wis.</a> at the end of the school day on Wednesday. Roberts' family had recently moved across the state line into unincorporated Antioch but kept her enrolled at Central High School District of Westosha.</p>
      <p>"At this time Sheriff’s Detectives believe Emma was given a ride home from school, where she packed a bag at her unincorporated Antioch home and left again before her family arrived home," the sheriff's office said. "As Emma packed a change of clothes, it is unknown what she is currently wearing."</p>
