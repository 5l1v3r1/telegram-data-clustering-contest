      <p>Finnish manufacturer, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/nokia">Nokia</a>, is getting ready to unveil a couple of smartphones. Recently, the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) certified three new Nokia devices with model numbers TA-1205, TA-1212, and TA-1234. Unfortunately, the EEC certification did not reveal anything regarding the smartphones. Nevertheless, some Nokia phones including Nokia 9.1, Nokia 8.2, Nokia 5.2 and Nokia 2.3 have been in the rumor mill. These new model numbers could belong to any of these phones.</p>

      <p>According to FCC certification, Nokia has phones with model numbers TA-1209, TA-1211 and TA-1214. Looking at the salient specs of this device, it is suspected to be the Nokia 5.2. FCC certification shows that this phone comes with a dimension of 157.69 x 75.41 mm. With this dimension, the diagonal measures 145mm which translates to a 5.7-inch screen (maybe smaller after considering the bezels).  While TA-1209 should be a Dual SIM device, TA-1211 and TA-1214 are the Single SIM phones.</p>
      <p>In addition, rumors have it that the Nokia 8.2 will have both 4G and 5G versions. There are also speculations that it will use a Snapdragon 735 SoC and will arrive next year. Another Nokia phone that is making the headline is Nokia 2.3. This device comes with model number TA-1206 and it already has Russia’s EEC and US’s FCC certifications.</p>
