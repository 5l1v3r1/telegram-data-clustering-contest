      <h4>Ahead of the 2019 Soul Train Awards, we’re looking back at the most epic looks from the show in years’ past — from Wendy Williams to Faith Evans and more!</h4>
      <p>We’re already looking forward to seeing the sure-to-be incredible red carpet looks at the 2019 <a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/tag/soul-train-awards">Soul Train Awards</a>. This year’s show happens LIVE on Nov. 17 in Las Vegas, and as the hours until the big event wind down, we’re taking a look back at some looks from the past. At the 2018 show, <b>Normani</b> absolutely ruled the red carpet in a little black dress, which featured a super short hemline and majorly low-cut neckline.<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/11/25/normani-dress-soul-train-awards-2018-photos/"> Normani looked FABULOUS</a> in the ensemble! <b>Faith Evans</b> <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/11/25/faith-evans-stevie-j-soul-train-awards-2018-pda/">also stood out</a> on the 2018 red carpet, as she wore a strapless black pantsuit that showed off her figure to perfection.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014, <b>Wendy Williams</b> wore a number of outfits throughout the night, as she served as host of the show. On the red carpet, she rocked a nude, bodycon dress, but during one of her show quick changes, she changed into a sparkling silver dress. The gown had a thigh-high slit, so Wendy’s legs were on full display, while her figure was accentuated perfectly. She paired the look with curly hair and a huge smile on her face. Of course, she also KILLED it onstage!</p>
      <p>Another great look at the Soul Train Awards was <b>Tamar Braxton</b> in 2017. She wore a silver dress, which featured sheer cutouts down the side and at her chest. Tamar paired the look with a sleek and straight hairstyle, and she looked absolutely fierce.</p>
