      <h1>Sure know something: we can Kiss this mad dream goodbye</h1>

      <p>Kiss frontman Paul "Star Child" Stanley once said of the band: “I think we represent freedom, expression of your fantasies – we’re like a dream.”</p>

      <p>For Australia’s Kiss fans, the dream run is over. We think. For now. Sort of. Having cancelled its End of the Road Australian tour, which was scheduled to start this week, because Stanley has a virus, the band will still be playing one show, on Monday, on a yacht some miles off Port Lincoln, with the stated goal of drawing sharks. Eight very lucky fans will marvel from a neighbouring vessel. Then they’ll head below to marvel at sharks. The sharks, no doubt, will marvel at Kiss. This dreamlike occasion is an exotic pet project of marketers at Airbnb. Stick with me.</p>
      <p>Forty years ago scores of Australian kids fell in love with Kiss. We fell in love with the silver-flash get-ups and Kabuki vampire schlock and the shock of animal magnetism. We trampled the couch declaring: “You showed me things they never told me at school.” Whirling tennis-racket guitars, warping strings with one-cent coins for picks, we howled and harmonised.</p>
      <p>What a spell we fell under. We embellished rumours about Gene Simmons' tongue (part human, part cow) and which planets Ace Frehley frequented (all of them). We craved the musky swap cards and stood under lurid posters in thrall.</p>
      <p>We fell in love with the songs – the hooks and the panting beats and the brilliantly nutty solos. We went from <i>The Wheels on The Bus</i> and <i>Ten Green Bottles</i> to <i>I Was Made For Loving You</i> and <i>God of Thunder, </i>from hymn book to “I’ve been a gambler but I’m nobody’s fool”.</p>

      <p>Not that every kid adored Kiss. Plenty didn’t get them and plenty more didn’t want to. For them, Kiss was a confounding joke. And for a while it looked like their disdain might be vindicated – after the gold rush (Kiss pencil-sharpener, anyone?) the band became deeply unfashionable. Some of the songs were as dumb as a bucket of chips. “No place for hidin’ baby/No place to run/You pulled the trigga on maaah . . . love gun.”</p>
      <p>Now, having ridden countless second winds, all lucrative, the end really is nigh for Kiss. Rock’n’roll’s party is losing its longstanding gatecrasher.</p>
      <p>Call them an unendurable cash cow flogging a dead horse. When I was a kid, they towered. They represented the freedom to walk your own way, to invent your own identity. Mick Jagger said it’s only rock'n'roll. Kiss made rock'n'roll a marvellously mad dream.</p>
