      <p>He was being treated for a rare genetic condition one one of the wards which was closed because of fears over water contamination, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/mailonsunday/index.html">Mail on Sunday</a>.</p>
      <p>The Crown Office confirmed cops were called after the boy's death.</p>
      <p>An investigation led by the Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit is now underway.</p>
      <p>It comes as expert reports from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are "under consideration".</p>
      <p>A Crown Office spokesman said: “The Procurator Fiscal has received a report in connection with the death of a three-year-old boy at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on 9 August 2017.</p>
      <p>“The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit (SFIU), is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."</p>

      <p>A police spokeswoman confirmed a report was submitted to the Procurator Fiscal but declined to comment further.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government said: "The death of any child is heartbreaking and we sympathise with their loved ones. An SFIU investigation is under way, so it would be inappropriate to comment further."</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: "We have already provided information to this family but are sorry that they have further questions.</p>
      <p>"We fully investigated this child’s death at the time and also asked for two independent experts to investigate the case, the outcome of which has been communicated to the family.</p>
      <p>"We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have. In this case the full findings were shared with the family."</p>
      <p>We told earlier how a whistleblower claimed tragic Milly died at the hospital after catching an infection linked to the ward's water supply.</p>
      <p>Milly's heartbroken mum has now demanded NHS chiefs stop "bullying" the anonymous employee who exposed the "cover up".</p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch, 35, claims her daughter c<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4959465/mum-daughter-killed-glasgow-hospital-dirty-water-health-truth/">ontracted a fatal infection while in remission from leukaemia the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</a></p>
      <p>The mum, from Lanark, has said she is "100 per cent" certain contaminated water caused the infection and told the BBC she feels "let down" and "lied to" in the wake of her daughter's death.</p>
