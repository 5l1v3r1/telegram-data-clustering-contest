      <h1>Moment man falls in slow motion onto car bonnet in ridiculous ‘crash for cash’ bid</h1>
      <h2>The footage was captured by two pals on their way to work in Sutton-in-Ashfield, as they saw him hurl himself onto their car</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:56:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:56</time> by <a rel="author">Brendan McFadden, Hollie Bone</a></address>
      <p>Ridiculous footage has emerged showing the moment a man hurls himself onto a car bonnet in slow motion in an alleged "crash for cash" scam.</p>
      <p>The bizarre dashcam recorded in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire on November 1, shows the man staggering in the road, before tumbling onto the bonnet and sliding slowly to the floor.</p>
      <p>The two pals in the car were left stunned before two security guards then dragged the man out of the road and gestured to them to keep moving.</p>
      <p>The computer technician drover, 49, reckons the man was looking to make a false insurance claim for compensation as as part of a crash for cash scam.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the footage which was recorded about 6am, the driver said: "I was driving along and I saw the car ahead put on the brakes so I slowed down, but I came to a stop when I saw him in the road - I thought he was drunk.</p>

      <p>"He put his hands on the bonnet and then slowly fell to the floor.</p>
      <p>"I was about to reverse and full beam him but then two security guards came along and started dragging him out the road.</p>
      <p>"It was definitely an attempt to get some compensation, he was trying some sort of scam but he didn't do it very well."</p>

      <p>The stunned driver initially laughed at the strange situation but after arriving at work he began to realise how serious it could have been.</p>
      <p>As he was travelling past a mental health hospital, Millbrook Mental Health Unit at the time, he began to suspect the man in the road could have been a patient.</p>
      <p>He said: "We just sat there in shock and wondered if he could be one of the patients from the hospital.</p>
      <p>"It was quite funny at first because it was so ridiculous but when I got to work I watched the footage and I realised it could have been a lot worse.</p>
      <p>"He could have started smashing up my car or anything."</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Millbrook Mental Health Unit, has been approached for comment.</p>
      <p>Crash for cash gangs often work together to snare innocent motorists.</p>
