      <p>Liverpool jewellery store Say It With Diamonds has released the ultimate advent calendar filled with some of its most popular pieces and gift vouchers.</p>
      <p>The '24 Days of Say It With Diamonds' calendar is filled with jewellery such as earrings, necklaces and more.</p>
      <p>Say It With Diamonds specialises in jewellery, particularly engagement rings, for all budgets.</p>
      <p>It started back in 2016 and is owned by friends Charlotte Donoghue and Steph Porter, who initially ran things from Instagram before opening a city centre store last year.</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, Say It With Diamonds relocated its Cavern Walks store to a new home inside the Metquarter.</p>
      <p>Priced at £200, the calendar includes 24 draws with an item inside each one.</p>
      <p>Demand has been huge for the calendar this year with the team announcing it was practically sold out - however fans can still sign up to a reserve list.</p>
