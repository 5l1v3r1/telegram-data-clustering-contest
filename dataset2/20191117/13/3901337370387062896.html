      <p>The Polish forward has been in superb form this season after netting 23 goals in 18 appearances across all competitions for the Bundesliga champions.</p>
      <p>RB Leipzig Timo Werner has enjoyed a good start to his campaign with 11 league goals in the 2019/2020 season, but he claims Lewandowski is at another level right now.</p>
      <p>"It's hard [to be top-scorer]," Werner told reporters, as per AS.</p>
      <p>"When you score two goals against Hertha Berlin and then watch the game evening game, having scored four or three goals less than Robert Lewandowski this season, and he scores twice against Borussia Dortmund... Against whom is he not going to score? That's very hard.</p>
      <p>"How he is playing at the moment, maybe only one or two players on the planet are on this level. That's the category of Messi and Ronaldo."</p>
