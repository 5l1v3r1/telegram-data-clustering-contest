      <h1>Ariana Grande says she's 'in so much pain' and has trouble breathing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:12:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">Theresa Waldrop, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Ariana Grande told her fans that she's "very sick" and may have to cancel an upcoming concert.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post Saturday, the pop star said her throat and head "are still in so much pain," and it's difficult to breathe during a show. She said she'd been struggling with the illness since her concert in London last month.</p>
      <p>"I just really don't know what's happening with my body right now and need to figure it out," Grande said.</p>
      <p>Although canceling the show is "the last thing i would ever want to do," Grande wrote, fans should take the post as a "gentle heads up" in case she can't "make the show happen" on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Grande is <a href="https://www.arianagrande.com/events">scheduled</a> to perform in Lexington, Kentucky, Sunday, the next stop on her world tour that ends in December.</p>
      <p>Grande said she's taking medication and is on IV drips, "doing everything i possibly can to pull through."</p>
      <p>Her fans wished her well and encouraged her to take care of her health first.</p>
      <p>"We wouldn't want anything happening to our beloved Ari," Ayoade Fridaos <a href="https://twitter.com/AyoadeFridaos/status/1195893155410960384">tweeted</a>.</p>
