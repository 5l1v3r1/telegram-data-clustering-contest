        <b>Connacht suffered the worst possible start to their first Champions Cup outing since the 2016/17 season as Aaron Cruden scored Montpellierâ€™s first try after just 70 seconds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prior to kick-off, Jarrad Butler, Matt Healy and Niyi Adeolokun were all <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/kennedymarisa760/blow-connacht-trio-replaced/">ruled out through injury</a> and while being interviewed on the pitch, club captain Butler predicted an 18-0 win for his side in the Sportsground.</p>
      <p>It was a prediction that quickly unravelled when some quick handling allowed Yvan Reilhac to draw in defenders on the wing and an offload to Cruden left the fly-half with ample space to touch down under the posts.</p>

      <p>Benoit Paillaugue nailed the conversion to give the visitors a 7-0 lead after just two minutes of play.</p>
      <p>Despite losing Cillian Gallagher to injury, Connacht have responded well to the early concession of points and have found their way onto the scoreboard through a Jack Carty penalty in the 17th minute.</p>
