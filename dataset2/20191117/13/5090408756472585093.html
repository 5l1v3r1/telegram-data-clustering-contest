      <h1>I tried the $3,000 digital weights machine that's like a Peloton for strength training and found how at-home fitness systems are the future — at least for those that can afford it, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:40:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Canales, Megan Hernbroth, Business Insider US</a></address>

        <li><a href="https://www.tonal.com/">Tonal</a> is an at-home workout machine that’s like a Peloton for strength training that mounts to your wall and offers on-demand coaching and digitally-connected personalized exercises.</li>
        <li>It costs $3,000 and is one of the first products in the at-home fitness workout market that focuses on resistance training instead of cardio, like Peloton does.</li>
        <li>I recently gave Tonal a try to see how it compares to traditional weight lifting.</li>
        <li>Take a look at how my workout went.</li>

      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.tonal.com/">Tonal</a> is an at-home strength training machine that uses electromagnetism to create resistance and mounts to your wall for a personalized workout with over 200 exercises, like deadlifts, bicep curls, and overhead presses, and on-demand coaching.</p>
      <p>With Tonal, performance anxiety at the gym could be a thing of the past – no more feeling self-conscious in front of your seemingly more experienced gym-goers, no more 30-plus minute round trips to the gym, and no more gym memberships.</p>
      <p>That is, if you can afford the <a href="https://www.tonal.com/product/tonal/">$3,000</a> price tag.</p>
      <p>Tonal was <a href="https://www.inc.com/kevin-j-ryan/founder-invents-digital-weight-equipment-tonal.html">invented by Aly Orady</a>, a Hewlett-Packard veteran who wanted an easier way to stay in shape at home that didn’t involve sweaty, used equipment and tedious trips to the gym.</p>
      <p>It operates similarly to its cardio cousin Peloton, whose stationary bikes retail for <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/shop/bike">$2,000.</a> Both are a part of a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boutique-fitness-market-facing-pressures-2019-8">growing trend</a> that is seeing digital, at-home fitness systems on the rise and gym attendance and boutique fitness studios declining in popularity.</p>
      <p>Tonal is one of the first products in the market with a focus on strength training. Fitness experts have increasingly stressed <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cardio-vs-weights-for-weight-loss">the importance of resistance training</a> in addition to cardio to maintain good health. And in an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/tonal-raises-45-million-to-bring-strength-training-to-more-living-rooms/">TechCrunch</a>, Orady said that a significant amount of Tonal users also own a Peloton bike (amounting to a collective $5,000 investment, if you were wondering.)</p>
      <p>I recently tried a Tonal workout for myself at the company’s San Francisco showroom. It was a bit hard to get used to at first, but I knew that if I were to own one, I’d adjust and would eventually have a convenient way of staying fit in the privacy of my home.</p>
      <p>Too bad it’s way out of my budget and that even if it wasn’t, mounting such a piece of equipment onto a wall in my rental apartment would likely make my landlord less than pleased.</p>
      <p>Here’s how my workout went.</p>

      <h3>When I work out, I opt for weight lifting rather than cardio. So Tonal stuck out more so than would a cardio-based at-home fitness machine, like the ultra-popular Peloton bike.</h3>
