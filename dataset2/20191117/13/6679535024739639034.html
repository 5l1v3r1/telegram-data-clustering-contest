      <h2>Three teams — Rajasthan, Vidarbha and Kerala — finished with 16 points.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:30:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-R-Praveen-Chandran-269/" target="_blank">M.R. Praveen Chandran</a></address>
      <p>Tamil Nadu crushed Vidarbha by 113 runs and stormed into the Super League of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy cricket tournament  here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu topped Group-B with 20 points with its fifth win of the tournament.</p>
      <h3>No contest</h3>
      <p>A close match appeared on the cards when Vidarbha restricted Tamil Nadu to a much lesser total than it threatened at the half-way stage of the innings.</p>
      <p>However, it turned out to be a no- contest in the end as the Tamil Nadu bowlers bundled out the Ranji Trophy champion for a paltry 55.</p>
      <p>Left-arm spinner R. Sai Kishore once again turned out to be Tamil Nadu’s hero with three wickets. Vijay Shankar made a significant contribution with his knock of 26 and three wickets.</p>
      <p>Captain Dinesh Karthik (58) and B. Aparajith(33) added 83 runs for the third wicket after openers M. Vijay and Washington Sundar were dismissed cheaply.</p>
      <p>The highlight of Tamil Nadu’s innings was Karthik’s excellent batting against Vidarbha’s spinners.</p>
      <p>Karthik mauled off-spinner Akshay Wakhare as Tamil Nadu raced to 93 for two at the end of 10 overs.</p>
      <p>However, Akshay Karnewar dismissed both Aparajith and Karthik in the 13th over to bring Vidarbha back into the match.</p>
      <p>The TN innings lost its momentum and it needed a few big hits from Vijay Shankar and Shahrukh Khan to prop up the total.</p>
      <h3>Varying his pace</h3>
      <p>Sai Kishore varied his pace and lured the Vidarbha batsmen to their doom.</p>
      <p>Jitesh Sharma’s aggressive intent off Sai Kishore’s third ball ended in the hands of Vijay Shankar at long-on.</p>
      <p>The dismissal set the trend for the rest of the innings as the Vidarbha batsmen perished to poor shots. In his second spell Sai Kishore dismissed Karnewar to complete a resounding win for Tamil Nadu.</p>
