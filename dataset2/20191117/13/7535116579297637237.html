      <p>In the original tweet, the netizen writes, <b>‚ÄúWe Malaysians have too many holidays. Annual leaves. Paternity leaves.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúIf you know you are about to have children you should have planned your leaves earlier.‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tweet which came from a netizen who lacks volition or basically has no idea what he was talking about, drew flak from netizens, most importantly from <a href="https://twitter.com/aizadfahmy/status/1195389973337231361?s=19">@aizadfahmy</a>.</p>

      <p>Slamming the netizen <a href="https://twitter.com/aizadfahmy/status/1195389973337231361?s=19">@aizadfahmy</a> writes, <b>‚ÄúThis disgusts me especially the second last part. Did you know that employees in developed countries enjoy a minimum of 20 days leave and we only get 14?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúMoreover other countries offer 16-month paternity leave with employees paying 80% of their salary because they realize how important it is for the children.‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>Clearly angry he continued his rant in the subsequent tweet, he mentions that the Swedes enjoy 20 days worth of public holidays, with 16-month paternity leave, adding that the netizen does not know what he is talking about.</p>

      <p>Netizens were of course in support of what <a href="https://twitter.com/aizadfahmy/status/1195389973337231361?s=19">@aizadfahmy</a> had to say, with 14k retweets and 8k likes.</p>
      <p>In truth, we too agree with the statement that we do not have enough day-offs, nobody would say no to more off days, right?</p>
      <p>It is important to note that a recent survey published in <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/539026/survey-malaysian-employees-are-overworked-sleep-deprived-unhealthy">NST</a> states that Malaysian employees are overworked, sleep-deprived and unhealthy.</p>
      <p>
        <i>We sincerely hope that more could be done to better working conditions in Malaysia, not all of us can afford to go overseas and work right?</i>
