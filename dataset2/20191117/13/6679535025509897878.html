      <p>Ramanathapuram</p>
      <p>A three-member gang has burgled a locked house at Theruvakottai village under Thiruvadanai police limit in the early hours of Sunday and decamped with 70 sovereigns of jewels and cash of â‚¹ 15,000.</p>
      <p>Police said Sarada, 58, who was living alone in the house after her husband had gone abroad for employment, went to Madurai on Saturday to visit a relative when the gang entered the house by bending and removing irons rods in a window.</p>
      <p>They broke open an almirah and decamped with the jewels and cash kept in a cloth bag, police said. After noticing some unusual noise, neighbours came out around 3 a.m. when the burglars broke open the front door and escaped on a two-wheeler.</p>
      <p>Deputy Superintendent of Police Pugazhendi Ganesh visited the spot and launched an investigation. Police pressed a sniffer dog into service and a technical team to lift finger prints. Special teams were formed to crack the case, police said.</p>
