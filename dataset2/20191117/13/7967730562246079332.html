      <p>The Australian arm of a charity founded by the Prince of Wales is behind a landmark housing project in inner Sydney to create a "mixed-income community".</p>
      <p>The Berejiklian government will today announce a partnership with the Prince's Trust Australia to build 75 affordable, social and private homes over two blocks next to Wentworth Park in Glebe.</p>

      <p>Property Minister Melinda Pavey said the agreement between NSW Land and Housing Corporation and Prince’s Trust Australia would deliver new housing for the most vulnerable.</p>
      <p>"Today we are releasing our vision to transform an 1800sq m site into a showcase housing project with significant community benefits,” Ms Pavey said.</p>
      <p>“This project will include a multi-purpose community hub which will be managed by the Prince’s Trust Australia."</p>
      <p>Prince’s Trust Australia, founded by Prince Charles, works to deliver social impact, by "transforming lives and building sustainable communities in Australia".</p>
      <p>One of its trustees, sustainable communities champion Dominic Richards, said the Glebe project would be the trust's first in Sydney and second in Australia.</p>
      <p>“The ongoing challenges of increasing urban density, housing affordability and climate change mean we are all responsible for improving urban livability and minimising development impacts on our natural environment,” Mr Richards said.</p>
      <p>“This project will help address these and other challenges – contributing to the wellbeing of the Glebe community through excellence in environmental sustainability, design place making and community engagement.</p>

      <p>“Our aim is for this project to be sustainable, respect local character and create a mixed-income community which includes social and affordable housing.”</p>
      <p>Architects Kiong Lee and Graeme Dix from Sydney-based firm Johnson Pilton Walker have prepared a project design to celebrate "historic and iconic building forms".</p>
      <p>The project is located on two blocks, on Cowper Street and Wentworth Park Road, separated by a laneway and next to Wentworth Park and MJ Doherty Reserve.</p>
      <p>The 75 homes will include a mixture of social, affordable and private housing.</p>
      <p>Ms Pavey said the government would engage with the local community and stakeholders before lodging a planning proposal with the City of Sydney Council.</p>
      <p>The Prince’s Trust Australia was established as a charity in 2013 under the guidance of Prince Charles, and is a part of a global network in countries including the UK, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
