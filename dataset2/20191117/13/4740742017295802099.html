      <h1>What shops you would most like to see in Bristol - including a new Primark</h1>
      <h2>The fall of a number of chains has left empty shops around the city</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:51:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>We are blessed here in Bristol to have an extensive list of shops on hand to fulfil all of our consumer desires.</p>
      <p>From high-end outlets like those found on Park Street to popular chains in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/cabot-circus">Cabot Circus.</a></p>
      <p>But that isn't to say there isn't room for more stores to open, especially with the collapse of a number of chains which have left empty buildings in popular locations.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, news broke of the latest casualty of the retail world when <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/mothercare-uk-closing-down-sale-3514505">Mothercare announced it was going into liquidation.</a></p>
      <p>Soon two huge shops in Eastgate and<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/cribbs-causeway"> The Mall </a>will be unoccupied so <i>Bristol Live</i> asked readers what <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/shopping-in-bristol">shops </a>they would like to open instead.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Primark at The Mall</h3>

      <p>This was by far the top choice by commenters on our Facebook page.</p>
      <p>At the moment, Bristol only has one Primark, which is based on the Horsefair.</p>
      <p>Many said they would love to have an outlet in Cribbs Causeway, saving them a journey into the city centre.</p>
      <p>The chain, renowned for its low-priced clothes, has been expanding this year, with the world's biggest store opening in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>So watch this space.</p>
      <h3>Monsoon at the Mall</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article2761146.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_110816monsoon_02JPG.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Several people supported the idea of a new Monsoon opening.</p>
      <p>Again, this chain already has an outlet in the city centre but there's clearly a market for an out-of-town shop as well.</p>
      <p>The store is famed for its beautiful party dresses and impressive accessories.</p>
      <h3>BHS back in city centre</h3>

      <p>Three years ago this department store closed its doors for the last time in Broadmead. The chain sold everything from underwear to household goodies but sadly went into administration in 2016.</p>
      <p>Now, there's calls to bring the store back to Bristol's High Street by one woman who said she would 'love to see' it return.</p>
      <h3>Decathlon</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>A few shoppers called for this sports retailer to open an outlet in Bristol.</p>
      <p>Currently, people have to travel as far afield as either Oxford or Southampton to reach a store owned by the French chain.</p>
      <p>The brand has launched a huge expansion around Europe this year so a new shop opening in Bristol isn't too hard to imagine.</p>
      <h3>Woolworths return to city centre</h3>

      <p>Who didn't used to love this chain's pick and mix range?</p>
      <p>So many kids spent their childhoods dreaming about their next visit, which sold everything from home appliances to sweets.</p>
      <p>Sadly, in 2008 the chain went into administration with scores of shops closing across the country.</p>
      <p>But people still haven't forgotten the joys of shopping there and one reader has called for its resurrection.</p>
