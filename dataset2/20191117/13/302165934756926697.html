      <p>TBILISI, Nov 17 — Thousands of opposition supporters rallied in Georgia today, demanding the government’s resignation and early parliamentary polls after the increasingly unpopular ruling party backtracked on promised electoral reforms.</p>
      <p>Protesters gathered outside the parliament building on the capital Tbilisi’s main thoroughfare in one of the biggest anti-government rallies in years amid mounting pressure on the ruling Georgian Dream party led by powerful oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili.</p>
      <p>Demanding the government’s resignation and snap parliamentary polls, the crowd waved Georgian and European Union flags, lit coloured flares and held up a giant banner with the anti-Ivanishvili slogan “All against One”.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties had called for the protest after forming an unprecedented united front against Georgian Dream, whose MPs last week voted down legislation to hold parliamentary elections next year under a new proportional voting system.</p>
      <p>The opposition accused Ivanishvili of orchestrating the bill’s failure, saying the ruling party unfairly benefits from the current voting system.</p>
      <p>At an earlier protest on Thursday, some 10,000 people rallied in Tbilisi, vowing to hold “permanent mass protests” until their demands for snap polls are met.</p>
      <p>Ivanishvili, Georgia’s richest man, had announced “large-scale political reform” under pressure following mass street protests in June and July.</p>
      <p>The summer protests saw a violent police crackdown in which 240 people were injured and two peaceful protesters lost an eye, including a teenage girl.</p>
      <p>Georgian Dream, in power since 2012, has seen its popularity plummet amid widespread discontent over its failure to address economic stagnation and perceived backsliding on its commitment to democracy.</p>
      <p>Critics have accused Ivanishvili, who is widely believed to be calling the shots in Georgia, of persecuting political opponents, suffocating critical media, and creating a corrupt political system where his private interests dominate government’s decision-making. — AFP</p>
