      <p>And another character who features prominently in this series is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/who-does-helena-bonham-carter-play-in-the-crown-season-3-11067806/">Princess Margaret, played by Helena Bonham Carter</a> – with the Queen’s sister’s relationship with her much younger boyfriend Roddy Llewellyn coming under the spotlight.</p>
      <p>The character is played in the series by actor Harry Treadaway – but who is he in real life and how long was he with the Princess?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Who was Princess Margaret’s ‘toy boy’ Roddy Llewellyn?</h3>
      <p>Roddy – or Roderick to give him his full name – is a British baronet who was born in Wales in 1947, the son of Olympic gold medal showjumper Sir Harry Llewellyn and his wife the Hon. Christine Saumarez.</p>

      <p>He was just 25 years old when he met Princess Margaret – who was 17 years older than him in 1973, with the pair being introduced by Margaret’s lady-in-waiting Anne Tennant.</p>

      <p>Margaret was still married to photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones – aka Lord Snowdon (played in the series by Ben Daniels)  – at the time, with whom she had two children, David and Sarah – but the marriage was rocky at the time.</p>
      <p>She and Roddy had grown close by the following year, and she invited him to her holiday home on the Caribbean island of Mustique – with photos of the pair of them in swimsuits on the island hitting the headlines two years later.</p>

      <p>Although the Princess’ official biographer Christopher Warwick described the pair as having a ‘loving friendship’, it was widely reported they had had an affair lasting from 1973 until 1981.</p>
      <p>Roddy spoke out about their relationship in 2002, saying: ‘I didn’t think about the consequences of such a high-profile affair  – if we all had crystal balls, we’d all know which horse to back wouldn’t we? I was just following my heart.’</p>

      <p>Although Margaret’s marriage to Lord Snowdon had already encountered problems – with him having had an affair with Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who later became his second wife – her relationship with Roddy was seen as a factor in the end of her marriage.</p>

      <p>The Princess was portrayed in a negative light by the press in the wake of the snaps being published – being portrayed as ‘a predatory older woman’ cheating on her husband – and she and Lord Snowdon divorced in 1978.</p>
      <h3>Did Margaret and Roddy stay together?</h3>

      <p>He went on to marry Tatiana Soskin in 1981, with whom he he has three daughters.</p>

      <p>Margaret died on 9 February 2002 aged 71, after suffering a stroke which resulted in cardiac problems, following several years of ill-health and a series of previous strokes.</p>
      <p>Her death came just seven weeks before the Queen Mother passed away, on 19 April 2002.</p>
      <h3>Where is Roddy Llewellyn now?</h3>
