      <p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has had a pretty big decade.</p>
      <p>He saw Amazon turn 25, became the richest man in the world, and even became a meme; he introduced the world to Alexa and bought Whole Foods. But he also weathered an attempt at blackmail and a high-profile divorce.</p>
      <p>As the decade draws to a close, let’s take a look back at what Jeff Bezos has been up to in the 2010s.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>In 2010, Amazon launched Amazon Studios as something of a crowd-sourced, anti-Hollywood-studio.</h3>
