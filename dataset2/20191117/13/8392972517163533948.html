      <h1>Strictly's Motsi Mabuse tickles viewers with a bizarre slip of the tongue during Blackpool show</h1>
      <h2>She seemed overwhelmed by how Kelvin and her sister performed</h2>

      <p>The stars of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> enjoyed performing in the show's annual spectacular at Blackpool's Tower Ballroom this weekend - and clearly everyone involved was excited to be there.</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse may have been more excited than anybody, however.</p>
      <p>The judge <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictlys-oti-mabuse-in-tears-over-kelvin-fletchers-touching-blackpool-surprise/">got very worked up after watching her younger sister Oti jiving with former Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher</a>, 35.</p>
      <p>So much so, that she started speaking GERMAN as she sang their praises!</p>

      </p>
      <p>And though she probably didn't mean to do it, fans of the show didn't seem to mind one bit, and took to Twitter to sing Motsi's praises.</p>
      <p>When Tess Daly asked her if Kelvin had made her day, Motsi gushed: "He made my life, not my day. Oh my God, Kelvin, what was that? I can't believe it!"</p>
      <aside>He's made Motsi speak German.</aside>
      <p>The judge, who lives in Germany, then tripped over her words as she started speaking German.</p>
      <p>The audience in the Tower Ballroom found it hilarious – and people at home loved it, too.</p>

      </p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: "LOL, he's made Motsi speak German." Another chuckled: "Motsi's 'you've got me speaking German' took me out." And a third told the judge: "I love when you start speaking German when you get excited about a dance. It makes me smile that you are so into it, your mind forgets where you are."</p>
      <p>Oti was originally partnered with Jamie Laing, but the Made In Chelsea star was forced to pull out of the series with a foot injury.</p>
      <p>She was then paired up with Kelvin, and they've been doing brilliantly – last night's jive secured three perfect 10s and a nine from the judges.</p>
