      <p>Investors will look to the retail sector next week, with Target (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT">TGT</a>), Home Depot (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HD">HD</a>) and Lowe's (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW">LOW</a>) due to report earnings along with some mall chains.
