      <h2>Worrying new research claims giving youngsters under 18 months screentime can cause sleep and behavioural problems.</h2>

      <p>Allowing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/babies">babies and toddlers</a> to watch TV or other screens can lead to emotional and behavioural problems as they grow up, according to new research.</p>
      <p>It disrupts sleep, potentially endangering development of the brain, scientists explained.</p>
      <p>A leading doctor said more than half the children studied had begun watching screens before they were 18 months old.</p>
      <p>The findings published in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics come in the wake of updated guidelines from the World Health Organisation banning screen time for under twos.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They were based on 367 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/children">pre-schoolers</a> in Singapore aged two to five with NDDs such as autism, language delay, global developmental delay and learning disorders.</p>
      <p>Lead author Dr Mae Wong, a paediatrician at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, said exposure to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/technology">smartphones, tablets, video game consoles and TV</a> before they were 18 months old was linked to poor sleep and emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBDs).</p>
      <p>The participants were followed between 2015 and 2017, with parents reporting on screen use, sleep habits and behaviour.</p>
      <p>More than half (52 per cent) began watching screens at the age of 18 months or earlier, with almost six in ten (58 per cent) having at least one device in their bedroom.</p>
      <p>Most (94 per cent) exceeded the 1 hour limit of daily average screen time recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).</p>
      <p>Nearly three quarters (72 per cent) had sleep problems and six in ten (60 per cent) emotional or behavioural difficulties. Children were more likely to spend time in front of screens if their parents did too.</p>
      <p>The researchers took into account levels of functional impairment to show</p>
      <p>the sleep problems and EBDs arose from screen use, rather than the children's own NDDs.</p>
      <p>Dr Wong said: "Despite controlling for this, there was still a clear association between first screen exposure earlier than 18 months of age and the presence of one or more screen devices in the bedroom, with sleep problems, poorer sleep quality and more EBDs.</p>
      <p>"Furthermore, children who experienced both lifestyle factors had more sleep and EBD problems than those who experienced only one lifestyle factor.</p>
      <p>"Although this study was conducted in children with neuro-developmental disorders (NDDs), the results are applicable to the general population."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Compared with typically developing children, children with NDDs are at overall higher risk for sleep problems, EBDs and poorer developmental outcomes.</p>
      <p>Added Dr Wong: "As this group of children also have more difficulties disengaging from screen use - possibly due to the attractive and repetitive nature of the screen content - increased screen use may possibly further exacerbate these problems,"</p>
      <p>Shared living or study spaces where media is consumed may also function as the infant or child's sleeping area, she said.</p>
      <p>Household lifestyle behaviours - such as the practice of co-sleeping with family members - could also be involved in exposing very young children to screens.</p>
      <p>Studies have reported associations between early and sustained increased screen use, poorer language and cognitive development, and EBDs in typically developing children worldwide.</p>
      <p>Increased screen use over time may also further interfere with the child's sleep quality and development, said Dr Wong.</p>
      <p>She advised parents to be alert to possible or detrimental health associations between poor screen use habits, sleep quality and EBDs in young children.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the WHO said sedentary screen time, including computer games, should not happen before a child is two.</p>
      <p>The limit for two to four-year-olds is an hour a day and less is better.</p>
      <p>The UK has no plans to update its own advice on screen use, which sets no time limits, although it says children should avoid screens before bedtime.</p>
      <p>The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health insists there is little evidence screen use for children is harmful in itself.</p>
      <p>The new WHO advice focuses on passive viewing - youngsters being placed in front of a TV or computer screen or handed a tablet or mobile phone for entertainment - and is aimed at tackling child inactivity, a leading risk factor for global mortality and obesity-related ill health.</p>
      <p>It was the first time it has made recommendations on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for children under five.</p>
