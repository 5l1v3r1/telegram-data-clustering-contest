      <p>Whenever I watch an adventure movie, there are always plenty of hazards in the terrain to keep the heroes at bay. Unfortunately, I feel like my gaming groups never have that same sense of danger from the world itself. Well, if you need a bit of help, you may want to check out <b><i>Hazardous Terrain Challenges</i></b> from <b>William Nelson</b>. This is an unofficial <b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b> supplement that is designed to be used in any setting and with any group. You don’t have to worry about your adventurers being too powerful or weak as Nelson also includes scaling charts to accommodate any group.</p>
      <blockquote>The existance of a Hazardous Terrain Challenge in your game will keep your players alert to their surroundings at all times. When their skills are put to the test to traverse treacherous terrain, they find a new appreciation for the distances they travel, and the ever-present danger of the fantasy world they’re exploring. Bring the world to life, and make it deadly!</blockquote>
      <p>You can purchase <i>Hazardous Terrain Challenges</i> from <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product_info.php?SRC=newsletter_new&amp;affiliate_id=1934285&amp;it=1&amp;products_id=294143">DMs Guild</a> for $2.95.</p>
