      <h1>Barcelona 'reject Ivan Rakitic transfer bid' from Premier League club</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd have been linked with a transfer move for Ivan Rakitic - but Barcelona have rejected a bid from a Premier League club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:55:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona have reportedly rejected a €15million (£13m) approach from an unnamed Premier League club for Ivan Rakitic.</p>
      <p>Croatian star Rakitic has fallen out of favour at the Nou Camp after the summer arrival of Frenkie de Jong.</p>
      <p>He has been tipped to join <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in the past, with Italian clubs such as Inter Milan and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> also keen.</p>
      <p>But an approach from a side in England has fallen well short of Barcelona's €35m valuation for the 31-year-old, according to <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barcelona-rejected-an-offer-from-a-premier-league-club-for-rakitic-7739228">Sport</a> .</p>
      <p>Rakitic still looks set to exit the club either in January or the summer as the club face the need to bring in over £100m in sales by the end of June to balance the books.</p>

      <p>However, it has been reported he is not keen on a move to the Premier League, instead preferring options elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He could also have the chance to stay in Spain and move to the capital with Atletico Madrid pondering a move.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> sporting director Eric Abidal insists Rakitic's omission is a football choice and that he knew before the season he would be out of Ernesto Valverde's plans.</p>

      <p>Abidal said: “Rakitic knows that it is a sporting decision. He must understand it.</p>
      <p>"He had already been warned that he was out of our plans.”</p>
      <p>Rakitic has played over 200 games for Barcelona since his 2014 move from La Liga rivals Sevilla.</p>
      <p>He has also won over 100 caps for Croatia, including playing a key role in their World Cup semi-final win over England last summer in Russia.</p>
