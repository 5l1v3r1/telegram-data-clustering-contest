      </p>
      <p>Gunmen suspected to be bandits, early Sunday, struck at Kofar Kudu community in Kaita Local Government Area of Katsina State, killing two men.</p>
      <p>The spokesman for the Katsina police command, SP Gambo Isah confirmed the development but said security operatives were on the trail of the suspected bandits.</p>
      <p>Sources said that the suspected bandits who were armed with AK 47 rifles had struck at the residence of a 50-year-old man, Sa’adu Da Bagalo in the community about 3.00 a.m and whisked him away.</p>
      <p>The police patrol team attached to Kaita division was alerted to the development and they reportedly responded and pursued the suspected bandits, leading to a fierce encounter between the police team and the bandits.</p>
      <p>The bandits reportedly killed Bagalo and another 58-year-old resident of the community, Bawale Inusa, in the process.</p>
      <p>An unnamed police officer and two others were also said to have sustained injuries during the encounter.</p>
      <p>SP Isah in his reaction to the incident said “On 17/11/2019 at about 03:01 hours, bandits in their numbers, armed with AK47 rifles, shooting indiscriminately attacked the residence of one Alhaji Sa’adu Dan Bagalo,m, aged 50 years of Kofar Kudu, Kaita Local Government Area of Katsina State and abducted him. Police patrol team attached to Kaita Division responded and gave the hoodlums a hot chase into the bush.</p>
      <p>“As police got closer and the hoodlums could no longer sustain the tempo, they killed the victim and one Bawale Inusa, male, aged 58 years of the same address and escaped through the bush path.</p>
      <p>“One police officer and two others sustained varying degrees of injuries during the fierce encounter.</p>
      <p>“Detectives led by DC CID, KTS , are combing the scene and surrounding bushes with a view to unravelling the full identities of the perpetrators. Investigation is ongoing.”</p>
