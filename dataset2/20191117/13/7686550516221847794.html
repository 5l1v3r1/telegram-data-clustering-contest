        <figcaption>A look back at the career history of new Cardiff City manager <b>Neil Harris</b></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After nearly a week of speculation, Cardiff City have finally appointed a successor to Neil Warnock, with former Millwall boss Neil Harris confirmed as the man to take over the reins at Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>Warnock will leave a club legend, but after some grumblings of discontent among fans this season, many feel it was the right time for him to walk away.</p>
      <p>With Warnock now gone, however, it throws up many new questions. But who will benefit from the manager's exit? And who will be worried about the of the new boss?</p>
      <p>We assess it all below.</p>
      <h3>WINNERS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The academy</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is likely that Harris will simply have to overhaul the club's academy system.</p>
      <p>The paltry amount of top quality Welsh youngsters who have been brought through the youth ranks in recent years has not been good enough and it has bred contempt among large sections of supporters.</p>
      <p>While Warnock has insisted he tried to change the structure, many believe, including ex-academy coach Craig Bellamy, that the former Bluebirds boss represented a road block in the grand vision of implementing an all-conquering youth system.</p>
      <p>A system reboot is now needed and that academy must become self-sufficient in order to benefit the first team in the not-so-distant future.</p>
      <p>A new manager with fresh ideas for the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff City</a> academy can only be a good thing.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Will Vaulks</b>
      </p>
      <p>One man who certainly needs a new lease of life at Cardiff is summer signing Will Vaulks.</p>
      <p>The Wales international came to the capital this summer in hope of playing a key role in a Bluebirds promotion push.</p>
      <p>That, sadly, has certainly not happened. Following a poor outing against Reading in the 3-0 defeat back in August, Vaulks has been frozen out of the side and has had to play much of his football for the under-23s.</p>
      <p>It's a sad state of affairs for a man who had so many backers after signing for the club in the summer.</p>
      <p>That is not to say, however, that his ambition of starring in this City midfield is altogether lost, and Harris may well see him as someone who has an important role to play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cameron Coxe</b>
      </p>
      <p>If there have been calls for any academy player to be given his chance in the first team, it's Wales youth international Cameron Coxe.</p>
      <p>The exciting full-back has made fleeting appearances for the City first team in recent years, but not nearly enough to placate many fans' desire to see him more often.</p>
      <p>Lee Peltier has been the nailed-on first choice this season, with Bruno Manga often filling the berth last year.</p>
      <p>However, in Peltier's absence against Reading, Warnock opted for Leandro Bacuna at right-back and he had a nightmare afternoon. Curtis Nelson was introduced a little after 20 minutes and also had an uncomfortable time of it.</p>
      <p>It only served to add to the frustrations of City fans, who would have loved to have seen Coxe given his chance.</p>
      <p>In his only first-team appearance this season, the Carabao Cup defeat by Luton Town, he was one of the only players to impress.</p>
      <p>He will hope a new manager places more faith in youth and he gets a much-deserved look-in.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LOSERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The big-money signings</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17113686.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1176635160.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The big-money signings like Josh Murphy, Gary Madine, Aden Flint and Robert Glatzel were all bought by Warnock and it is fair to say they haven't quite lived up to the billing so far.</p>
      <p>You get the impression that under the manager who signed them that they would always get a chance in the team, mainly because Warnock was determined to be proven right.</p>
      <p>Harris is a new man, his own man, and has no loyalties to anyone. You can view that two ways - either in a positive or negative light. For the club itself it can only be a good thing - everyone will now have to do their best to prove themselves to the new gaffer. But for certain Warnock players, the writing could be on the wall.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The media</b>
      </p>
      <p>There aren't too many characters left in the game and Warnock was certainly one of them. The 70-year-old was always good value in interviews, press conferences and radio phone-ins, and his ability to give the press a line will certainly be missed.</p>
      <p>Warnock was old school in the extreme and the new breed of managers simply don't operate in the way that he did.</p>
      <p>His views on Brexit, referees or his reaction to controversial decisions certainly caught the eye and the footballing world will be a quieter place for his absence.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Isaac Vassell</b>
      </p>
      <p>It may appear a tad harsh to place the youngster in this section but Cardiff are certainly overstocked in the striking department and with Vassell currently on the sidelines, he may struggle to break into Harris' first-team plans. Vassell's checkered injury record also needs to be taken into account.</p>
      <p>Warnock pursued him for years and although it is still very early days in his career in South Wales, you feel that he will have to really hit the ground running when he returns to fitness to overcome the disadvantage he is at. Will Harris have the same patience with him that Warnock had?</p>
