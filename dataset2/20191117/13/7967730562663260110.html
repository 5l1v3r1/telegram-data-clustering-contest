      <h1>Uber Eats driver sacked for being 10 minutes late seeks tribunal appeal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Patty</a></address>
      <p>A sacked Uber Eats delivery worker will on Monday appeal against a Fair Work Commission decision that rejected her unfair dismissal claim in a case legal experts say will have serious ramifications for the gig economy's business model.</p>
      <p>Amita Gupta will be the first worker in Australia to take on the company with legal representation. Uber workers previously have unsuccessfully represented themselves in the FWC.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gupta was sacked for being 10 minutes late for a job.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gupta speaks little English and her husband Santosh represented her in the hearing into her sacking. Commissioner Peter Hampton rejected her claim in August on the basis that she was not an "employee" under the Fair Work Act.</p>
      <p>Mr Gupta said: "Most of the legal side of things I did not know. Uber had the upper hand with a lawyer and counsel in the tribunal.</p>
      <p>"The tribunal said there is not an obligation to log on the Uber app. But there is an obligation to work when you log on and if you don't accept jobs, your rating goes down. If the rating goes below 85 per cent, you get cut off.</p>
      <blockquote>If there is no fixed time, how could they say she was late?<cite>Santosh Gupta</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"Uber says there is no fixed time to reach a location. But if there is no fixed time, how could they say she was late?"</p>
      <p>The Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) will on Monday ask the full bench of the FWC in Sydney to hear Mrs Gupta's case on the grounds of public interest to determine whether she was an employee and not an independent contractor.</p>
      <p>The union won an unfair dismissal case against Foodora last year <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50gic.html">on behalf of food delivery rider Josh Klooger</a> on the basis that he was an employee and not an independent contractor as asserted by the company.</p>
      <p>TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said: "Amita’s case shows the slave-like conditions gig economy workers face: in one week alone she was logged on to the app for 96 hours and was paid just $300. When she was late with an order by 10 minutes, Uber sacked her.</p>
      <p>"We do not believe it is in the public interest for these dystopian conditions to be allowed to endure and become the norm in Australia.”</p>

      <p>University of Adelaide professor of law Andrew Stewart said Mrs Gupta's case was significant because the FWC full bench and "potentially in due course the higher courts" would grapple with Uber’s defence to the accusation that its drivers or riders are employees.</p>
      <p>"This is the claim that workers who find jobs through Uber or Uber Eats are at no point under any requirement to work, so that the 'mutuality of obligation' necessary for an employment relationship is lacking," he said.</p>
      <p>"That suggestion has been comprehensively rejected ... in the UK, as being inconsistent with the reality of the relationship between Uber and its drivers. But it was accepted by commissioner Hampton in this matter, and was also cited by the Fair Work Ombudsman as the main reason for not taking Uber to court.</p>

      <p>"If Uber ultimately prevails, it may set an important precedent for other businesses seeking to avoid employment obligations. Conversely, a loss would mean a massive blow to its business model."</p>
      <p>University of Technology Sydney law professor Joellen Riley Munton said the FWC's decision in August was consistent with others involving rideshare drivers.</p>
      <p>"For this to be overturned, I think the Full Bench is going to have to be prepared to take account of what commissioner Hampton does acknowledge as ‘soft control’ in the relationship. The deal might say that she doesn’t have to accept deliveries, but if she knocks back three in a row she is automatically logged off.</p>
      <p>"And she can be given poor ratings by both restaurants and eaters if she cancels jobs. The very fact that they could ‘sack’ her for being late ... shows that she is in all practical respects under their control."</p>
      <p>An Uber spokeswoman said it welcomed the FWC's decision in August and would defend the appeal.</p>
      <p>"It reflected what delivery partners tell us ... that they value the freedom and flexibility the Uber app provides," she said.</p>
