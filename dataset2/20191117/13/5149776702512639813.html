      <p>Making your debut in English football at Fulham could be seen as something of a baptism of fire for some.</p>
      <p>Those were the cards dealt to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/brice-samba">Brice Samba</a> by his new manager at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>, Sabri Lamouchi, in late August, when the goalkeeper was handed his Championship debut at Craven Cottage.</p>
      <p>Samba, undaunted by the prospect, impressed on his first league start a week or so after playing against Fleetwood in the Carabao Cup, helped Lamouchi’s men to an impressive 2-1 win at the home of the promotion favourites and he's not looked back since.</p>
      <p>Having dislodged Manchester City’s highly-rated loan stopper <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-samba-3450550">Aro Muric to become Forest’s number one</a>, Samba admits the start Lamouchi gave him was far from easy though now things have settled down somewhat.</p>

      <p>“I’m liking it,” he said in his first interview with the club.</p>
      <p>“It’s not an easy start at Fulham.</p>
      <p>“The game is very athletic, very aggressive it’s not the same as playing in France.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s very good, it’s beautiful,” adding that the people in Nottingham had been “amazing” since his summer move from Caen.</p>
      <p>Samba’s influence on the team has been stark, going unbeaten in 11 of his 13 games keeping six clean sheets along the way and it’s that form he feels makes promotion possible.</p>
      <p>“For the fans, for the team this is good to go for promotion,” said the 25-year-old.</p>
      <p>“This year the Championship is not easy. It’s a very long (season), playing 46 games is not easy.</p>
      <p>“It is possible and we deserve it with the players (to be fifth in the table).</p>
      <p>“In football it is possible.”</p>

      <p>Samba is no stranger to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-lamouchi-samba-muric-3475506">head coach Sabri Lamouchi</a> and believes his teammates are fortunate to have him as manager, having guided them to fifth in the Championship as the often crucial festive period draws ever closer.</p>
      <p>“I have a very good relationship with Sabri,” Samba revealed.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good coach for the players. He has a good relationship with the players.</p>
      <p>“The players are very lucky to have the gaffer."</p>
      <p>Samba has been <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-fans-brice-samba-3537876">quick to endear himself to the supporters</a>, with various social media posts with his teammates which have been well received, and he believes the spirit in the Forest camp is key if they're to end a two-decade wait for Premier League football.</p>
      <p>"The supporters are amazing here.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of players which have a good relationship. We are good friends, after training we go for food – it’s good in the team.</p>
      <p>“It’s very important for the objective this season that we’re all together.”</p>
