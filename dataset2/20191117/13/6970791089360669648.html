      <h1>Colin Kaepernick Stumps League By Changing Workout Location + Tells NFL To Stop Running From Him: “We Have Nothing To Hide”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:25:46+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">Biz Jones</a></address>
      <p>NFL free agent <b>Colin Kaepernick</b> left teams scratching their heads ahead of publicized Saturday workout. The quarterback reportedly changed up the event’s location less than an hour before the scheduled spectacle.</p>
      <p>According to reports, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colin-kaepernick-workout-holds-workout-at-new-location-without-nfls-approval/">Kaepernick moved the workout</a> to nearly 60 miles away from the originally planned location.</p>
      <blockquote>The workout was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colin-kaepernick-workout-football-insiders-question-why-now-2019-11-16/">originally set for 3 p.m.</a> and was to be held at the Atlanta Falcons’ practice facility in Flowery Branch. At 2:30, representatives for the free agent quarterback informed the league that Kaepernick would instead be conducting the workout at 4 p.m. at Drew High School in Riverdale, Georgia. </blockquote>
      <p>Following the Saturday spectacle, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28095462/colin-kaepernick-throws-passes-40-minutes-workout-urges-nfl-stop-running">Colin told reporters</a> he’s prepared to take over the NFL again.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve been ready for three years,” Kaepernick said. “I’ve been denied for three years. We all know why I came out here. [I] showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. So we’re waiting for the 32 owners, 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them stop running. Stop running from the truth. Stop running from the people. … We’re out here. We’re ready to play. We’re ready to go anywhere. My agent, Jeff Nalley, is ready to talk [to] any team. I’ll interview with any team at any time. I’ve been ready.” (ESPN)</blockquote>
      <p>In a “First Take” broadcast this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/FirstTake/status/1194668106163068930">ESPN’s <b>Stephen A. Smith</b> explained how</a> music mogul <b>JAY-Z</b>‘s controversial decision to team up with the NFL last summer could easily be the reason the league gave Kaep another chance.</p>
      <blockquote>“This is ‘league’ organized. Now to me the name that comes to my mind is JAY-Z and Roc Nation. Why? Because JAY-Z meets with Commissioner Roger Goodell. At that particular moment in time, he’s excoriated, all of a sudden, Hov, who everybody loved, a whole bunch of folks turned against him, accused him of selling out, turning in his black card and all of this ridiculous nonsense. And what did he say? He said, ‘Listen, folks are going to work behind the scenes.’ Called the NFL office, called the Players Association, spoke to a whole bunch of people, Kaepernick’s side, Roc Nation, the list goes on and on. Clearly there appears to be an effort that’s taking place to include these teams with league participation and league approval, obviously, so it appears to be something very, very serious and the only thing that can get in the way of Colin Kaepernick being back in the NFL is if he refuses to shut up and/or he goes out there and shows he can’t play.” (“First Take”)</blockquote>
