      <h1>'Sideways move' - West Brom star sent Manchester United warning</h1>
      <h2>West Brom transfer news | Albion are expected to tie up a deal for the talented Brazilian in the coming windows</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:23:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion fans have been having their say on reports linking Matheus Pereira with a shock move to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>It is widely expected that the Baggies will turn Pereira's loan deal into a permanent one in the coming months, but reports in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfers-pereira-brom-17269744">national press have claimed there is top flight interest.</a></p>

      <p>The 23-year-old has been in stunning form since his season-long loan deal from Sporting this summer. In his opening 15 games for Albion, Pereira has three goals and nine assists to help his side to the top of the Championship table.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-eyeing-matheus-pereira-20897155">the Mirror,</a> those performances have impressed talent spotters from Old Trafford, who have been keeping tabs on his progress.</p>
      <p>The report suggests a number of Premier League clubs have been impressed with his early season form, who see him as a low risk signing at the price quoted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pereira’s parent club are already preparing for life without the midfielder. Reports in Portugal have claimed that the Baggies are expected to exercise their option to bring him to the Hawthorns permanently in January, with Sporting already planning what they will do with the funds they recoup.</p>
      <p>Here's how <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> fans on social media, reacted to the possibility of their loan ace making a move to Old Trafford:</p>

      <p><b>Dave Sydenham:</b> I'm sure we have 1st option on him . 9 million handed over then phone call to United the price is £90 million</p>
      <p><b>Faye Russell:</b> He's going nowhere mate</p>
      <p><b>BaggieBoy75Mike:</b> Man Utd monitoring Pereirra! Well unfortunately for them the deal is done to bring him in permanent in the summer the deal is done so they can monitor all they like! Maybe a year in the PL with us then he can go for 30+ mil</p>
      <p><b>@LuiWBA_:</b> They’re just jealous that we’ve got the better Pereira imo</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@DanJTudge:</b> Always likely with the way he’s playing, but we can make instant massive profit. He is f****** brilliant</p>
      <p><b>@Jay89R:</b> Why would he go? This time next year it’ll be a side ways move</p>
