      <p>Italy coach Conor O'Shea has resigned with immediate effect six months before his contract was due to expire, the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) has announced.</p>
      <p>ROME: Italy coach Conor O'Shea has resigned with immediate effect six months before his contract was due to expire, the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) has announced.</p>
      <p>Irishman O'Shea, who has been linked in the media with a post in the England set-up, took charge of Azzurri in March 2016 and was contracted to stay in the job until the end of May 2020.</p>

      <p>"I loved every minute I spent in Italy and I really believe in what we have done," O'Shea said in an FIR news release.</p>
      <p>"We have started a process and generated a new, well-founded hope but I also believe that the end of the Rugby World Cup represents the best time for everyone to make changes."</p>
      <p>Italy won nine and lost 31 of 40 tests under O'Shea, losing all of their Six Nations fixtures and failing to get out of their opening-round pool at the recently concluded World Cup.</p>
      <p>The former Ireland fullback had a wider remit than just running the test side, however, and believes he has made good progress in setting up the structures to allow the Italian game to flourish.</p>
      <p>"The youngsters who are coming in are joining a system that can only improve in the years to come if the right decisions continue to be made," O'Shea added.</p>
      <p>"The job of all of us is to leave the shirt in a better place than the one in which we found it (and) I sincerely hope I have left the Italian rugby in a better position."</p>
      <p>London's Daily Telegraph last month reported that O'Shea would be installed in a new post at England's Rugby Football Union (RFU) before the start of the 2020 Six Nations, working closely with head coach Eddie Jones.</p>
      <p>"We are saddened by Conor's decision not to complete the journey as contractually intended," FIR President Alfredo Gavazzi said.</p>
      <p>"We thank him for the commitment and passion with which he has performed his role and we wish him the best for the future."</p>
