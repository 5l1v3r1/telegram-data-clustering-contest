      <p>The last few years have proved that there’s no stopping Ayushmann Khurrana. The actor has been delivering big time when it comes to box-office numbers and with Bala, he’s just secured his seventh consecutive hits. It seems like Ayushmann has almost made the genre of films based on social causes his own. With Bala, the makers portrayed the message that how much we value physical appearances in our society. Whether it is for the state of the hair on our head or the colour of skin. </p>

      <p>Talking about the box-office collections of the film, Bala started on a positive note as it managed to collect Rs 10.5 crore on its opening day. The film, which also stars Yami Gautam and Bhumi Pednekar, is almost two weeks old now but there are no signs of the numbers slowing down. Yesterday, the film collected a total of Rs. 6.73 crore taking the total collections to Rs. 82.73 crore. <br/><br/>It will be interesting to see if the Bala can now maintain its grip at the box-office while facing competition from new releases like Marjaavaan and Motichoor Chaknachoor. </p>
