      <p>Three Indian players – Manvinder Bisla, pacer Manpreet Gony and former Rajasthan Royals player Kumar Boresa – are part of the player draft for the new season of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), which will begin on December 11.</p>
      <p>Bisla played a special knock in the final of the 2012 IPL as Kolkata Knight Riders claimed their first IPL trophy.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hasan has said efforts are on to increase the participation of Indian players in the T20 league, which has been revamped after being hit by scandals over match-fixing and delays in payment.</p>
      <p>The league, launched in 2011, has now been taken control of by BCB, the country’s cricket board, and has been renamed as the ‘Bangabandhu BPL’.</p>
      <p>“We proposed to bring in Indian players who are outside the contract of their board (BCCI). They can play in principle,” BCB president Nazmul Hassan told reporters in Dhaka on Saturday night, PTI reported.</p>

      <p>“I am not sure if we will get them in this BPL, but hopefully we will get them in future. Will try for them in this BPL too,” he added.</p>
      <p>The BCCI does not allow cricketers under its contract to feature in foreign T20 leagues. Some, like <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yuvraj-singh/">Yuvraj Singh</a>, have played in some foreign leagues after retiring from all forms of cricket.</p>
      <p>Bisla, Gony and Boresa, the three Indians who are likely to be picked by teams for this season’s BPL, are not part of the BCCI’s central contract system.</p>

      <p>The BPL attracts quite a few international cricketers of repute. Last year, it served as the stage for a clash between <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/steve-smith/">Steve Smith</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/david-warner/">David Warner</a>, who had then been serving an international ban for the ‘Sandpapergate’ ball tampering scandal.</p>
