      <p>It may nearly be Thanksgiving, but wildfire weather is still lingering in California.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E currently has an "<a href="https://pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/psps-weather-map.page">elevated</a>" potential for a public safety power shut-off (PSPS) on Nov. 20-21 as warm temperatures and gusty offshore winds enter the forecast again.</p>
      <p>"High pressure building over the territory this weekend results in much warmer than normal weather. Expect maximum temperatures away from the immediate coast to rise into the 70s to low 80s, which is 10–20 degrees above normal for mid-November," the PG&amp;E forecast reads.</p>
      <p>The elevated risk is for PG&amp;E geographic zones 2-5. Those zones include parts of Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Humboldt, Lassen, Plumas, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama, Trinity, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, Alameda, Colusa, Contra Costa, Napa, San Benito, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Yolo, Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra and Yuba counties. You can <a href="https://pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/psps-weather-map.page">check your geographic zone here</a>.</p>
      <p><b>ALSO</b>: <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/97633-PGE-text-alert-shut-off-power-number-14502485.php">How to get PG&amp;E to send you a text alert ahead of a power shutoff</a></p>
      <p>"Both the forecast and the scope of the weather event remain very fluid three days ahead of the event. At present, projections reflect a possible weather event similar to previous PSPS events that impacted about 180,000 customers," <a href="http://investor.pgecorp.com/news-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/PGE-Monitoring-a-Mid-Week-Potentially-Strong-Offshore-Wind-Event/default.aspx">PG&amp;E said in a press release</a> Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E estimates three people are represented by each "customer," which means 540,000 California residents may be affected. The utility says that since the last preemptive power outages, their site and call center have been bolstered to handle increased traffic; the PG&amp;E outage site repeatedly went down during previous PSPS events.</p>
      <p>"Elevated" is the second tier of PG&amp;E's public safety power shut-off system. The next level is "PSPS watch," which indicates a "reasonable chance" of an outage within 72 hours. The final tier is "PSPS warning"; at that stage, PG&amp;E customers should be receiving communications from the utility that their power may be shut off imminently.</p>
      <p>"There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the strength, timing and humidity levels with this system," PG&amp;E said. "Expect changes in the forecast moving forward."</p>
