      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is set to commence the collation of results of the Bayelsa State governorship election conducted on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The exercise, which was scheduled to start at 10.00 am on Sunday at the Prof. Mahmood Yakubu Media Centre, had been delayed indefinitely.</p>
      <p>The commission’s Head, Voter Education and Publicity, Wilfred Ifogah, had indicated on Saturday night that the exercise would begin at 10.00 am on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, almost five hours after, the collation is yet to commence.</p>

      <p>There is heavy security presence within and outside the commission’s office located along the Swali Market Road in Yenagoa.</p>
      <p>Only five journalists have been admitted into the hall; the others have asked to monitor the proceedings from a canopy outside the auditorium.</p>
