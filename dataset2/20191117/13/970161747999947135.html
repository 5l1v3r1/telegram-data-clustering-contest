      <p>Robbo (Jake Ryan) has been through a lot in recent weeks, with the latest drama involving him being kidnapped by Dylan Carter (Jeremy Lindsay Taylor) and held in a pit – before he managed to turn the tables in his favour and trap his captor.</p>
      <p>Now Robbo has returned to the Bay, alarming Colby (Tim Franklin) due to his bloodied appearance and leaving Jasmine (Sam Frost) in the lurch as he won’t call her to tell her he’s safe. He calls Des (Matt Zeremes) to tell him he has what he’s looking for – Dylan Carter is with him.</p>
      <p>Des is taken aback – Robbo has his wife back, so why has he come up with the goods? Robbo says it will never be over until Des gets what he wants, so he’s prepared to strike a deal. The condition is that he deals with Victor (Patrick Thompson) directly.</p>

      <p>Des says there’s no chance, but Robbo says the only way they’re getting Carter is if Victor plays along. We then discover that Carter is handcuffed to the truck, sitting next to Robbo and being used as leverage.</p>

      <p>The next day, the two men wait for Des’s move and Carter tries to be friendly to Robbo. But Robbo isn’t interested, instead telling him to keep his mouth shut. The stakeout continues until Robbo gets a text from Des with a time and place to meet.</p>
      <p>The pair show up at an industrial site, and Robbo tells Dylan that it’s time to wait. They are thrown when only Des and some of his thugs show up. Des tells Robbo that Victor suspects he’s playing a game, so Robbo had better tell them what’s going on – or he can forget about seeing Victor. Is Robbo’s mysterious plan about to fall apart?</p>
