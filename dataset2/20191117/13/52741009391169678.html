      <p>If you used to watch the show or movies as a kid, and always wanted to be a part of The Addams Family, now's your chance!</p>
      <p>K-W Musical Productions is accepting video auditions for its upcoming musical. </p>
      <p>All you need to do is film yourself singing a section from two pop or musical theatre songs. Then upload it to YouTube, and send in the link.</p>
      <p>If you think you'll really shine in person, there are some live auditions happening on November 26 and 27.</p>
      <p>If you're less about singing and acting, and more about the art of movement, a dance call is set for December 1.</p>
      <p>The show will run at the Conrad Centre for the Performing Arts in Kitchener from May 27 to June 6, 2020. </p>
      <p>You can see full details by clicking <a href="https://kwmp.ca/shows/addams-family/auditions/">here</a>.</p>
