      <p><b>PARISÂ (AP)</b> - Yellow vest activists are staging fresh protests across France to mark the birth last year of their movement for economic justice, a day after scuffles between Paris police and activists marred the anniversary.</p>
      <p>Interior minister Christophe Castaner deplored Saturday's violence on CNews television. He said Paris police had detained 173 people.</p>
      <p>Authorities said about 28,000 people marched across France on Saturday, including 4,700 in Paris. Yellow vest activists said there were 44,000.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, dozens of protesters briefly gathered under the dome of Paris' Galeries Lafayette store to denounce consumer culture.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 17, 2018, hundreds of thousands of people blocked traffic around the country to protest a fuel tax hike. The sometimes-violent protests have increasingly vented anger at President Emmanuel Macron's policies, who is seen as favoring the rich.</p>
