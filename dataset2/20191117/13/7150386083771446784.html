      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday retweeted a post by the United States Senator Bernie Sanders, saying that all the promises being made in the tweet by him have already been fulfilled by the Delhi government.</p>

No one should sell their house because they got cancer. No one with chronic illness should be in debt their whole life. We’re going to eliminate all past-due medical debt and guarantee health care to all.”</p>
      <p>Kejriwal, retweeting the post, said that “All the promises American political parties are making to fulfil if they win elections, we have done all this work in Delhi in the last five years.”</p>
