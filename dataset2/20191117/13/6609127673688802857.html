      <p>Mr Corbyn's comments followed a warning from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford that Scotland's desire for independence is "unstoppable" and must not be blocked by the next prime minister.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Blackford pressed the case for IndyRef2 and argued it would be undemocratic to prevent another vote.</p>
      <p>Party leader Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a second independence poll in late 2020.</p>
      <p>And the Nats chief has said she will write to the Prime Minister after the election demanding the power to do so.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, asked if he could give Mr Blackford a commitment for an independence vote within the first year under a Labour Government, said: "No. I can't give him that.</p>

      <p>He added: "I do not want us to spend the first year on an independence referendum."</p>
      <p>He instead focusing on Labour's pledge to invest a further £70 billion in Scotland through their planned National Investment Bank.</p>
      <p>The Labour boss said: "I say gently to the SNP, they will have the opportunity with a Labour Government in Westminster of seeing a fair allocation of resources to Scotland, they will see an investment in Scotland that will deal with the massive health and social inequality they face."</p>
      <p>He ruled out a referendum before the next Holyrood election in 2021 and said: "Up until then, certainly not."</p>
      <p>During his interview, Mr Blackford said the SNP were "wanting to lock the Tories out of office" to prevent the UK leaving the EU, in addition to fighting for a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>He claimed a "move towards independence is unstoppable" - irrespective of who wins the upcoming election.</p>
      <p>When asked about forming coalitions with other parties, he said: "Our priorities, principally, in this election is about making sure we can escape Brexit - that's the first thing - but also securing Scotland's right to choose its own future."</p>
      <p>On securing powers to hold another independence referendum, he said: "It doesn't matter if it's Jeremy Corbyn or if it's anyone else, whoever is prime minister has got to respect democracy and the simple fact of the matter is the SNP won the election to the Scottish Parliament in 2016 on a manifesto commitment of a referendum if there was a change of circumstances."</p>
      <p>He said if the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats on a commitment to hold another vote "it will ill-behold any prime minister to stand in the face of democracy and the right of Scots to choose".</p>
