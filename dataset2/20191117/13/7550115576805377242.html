        <b><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a> has left the Netherlands squad ahead of their Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia, with the KNVB citing “personal circumstances.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 28-year-old captained the Dutch in their 0-0 draw with Northern Ireland on Saturday evening, with the point gained securing qualification to next year’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Tuesday night’s clash in Amsterdam cannot be considered a dead rubber, as the Netherlands can still top Group C if other results go their way, but they were still able to celebrate in Belfast.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> was an unused substitute at the weekend after suffering illness earlier in the week, but should feature in midfield against Estonia.</p>
      <p>But the Dutch FA have <a href="https://www.onsoranje.nl/nieuws/nederlands-elftal/77353/virgil-van-dijk-ontbreekt-tegen-estland">confirmed</a> that Van Dijk has withdrawn from duty due to personal reasons, leaving Ronald Koeman’s squad immediately.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether this impacts his involvement for Liverpool on Saturday, but the priority remains Van Dijk’s well-being, not his availability against <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>He becomes the latest player to pull out of this month’s internationals, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/tag/caoimhin-kelleher/">Caoimhin Kelleher</a> all absent due to illness and injury.</p>

      <p>The majority of Klopp’s first-team squad will be back at Melwood by midweek, with Wijnaldum, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/rhian-brewster/">Rhian Brewster</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sepp-van-den-berg/">Sepp van den Berg</a> the last in action on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Preparations will the begin for the trip to Selhurst Park, with Liverpool eight points clear at the top of the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> and seeking their 12th win in 13 games.</p>
      <p>If Van Dijk is unavailable, Klopp will hope to call upon <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joel-matip/">Joel Matip</a>, who is expected back after injury, but Gomez should also be an option to partner <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/dejan-lovren/">Dejan Lovren</a> if required.</p>
