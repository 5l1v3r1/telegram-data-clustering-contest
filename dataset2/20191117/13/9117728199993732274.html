      <p><i>“Honestly, I can laugh about it now. It happened. I think it was karma from my Dad back in the day. Now I’ve got it back,"</i> Verstappen said. </p>
      <p>Jos Verstappen, Max's father, crashed into race leader Juan Pablo Montoya at the 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix as the Williams driver looked likely to win in just his third race in his Formula 1 career. </p>

      <p><i>“My dad took out the leader when he got lapped, so it was karma. It had to happen to me,"</i> Verstappen told Sky Sports. </p>
      <h3>Can Max clinch third place?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> driver can't clinch third place today but can certainly put the pressure on <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a>. Verstappen is currently sandwiched between the two Ferrari drivers but has a 14 point deficit to Leclerc. </p>
