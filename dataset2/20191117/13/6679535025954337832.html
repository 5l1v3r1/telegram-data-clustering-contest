      <h2>Bengal’s hopes of reaching the knock-out stage dashed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:54:55+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Shayan-AcharyaMumbai-119972/" target="_blank">Shayan AcharyaMumbai</a></address>
      <p>It went till the last over, but seasoned campaigner R. Vinay Kumar held his nerves to guide Pondicherry to a four-wicket win over Bengal in a Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy fixture at the Bandra-Kurla Complex here on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Chasing a modest 133, Pondicherry required eight runs from the last five balls, and Vinay hammered a six and a boundary to seal the deal for his side, with two balls to spare.</p>
      <p>With this defeat, Bengal’s hopes of reaching the knock-out stage were dashed.</p>
      <p>While Vinay did the star-turn in the end — dishing out a six-ball 15 — it was captain Rohit Damodaran’s gritty 55 that paved the way for Pondicherry’s victory. Crafting his innings with five boundaries and four sixes, Rohit ensured that his side got off to a steady start, chasing Bengal’s total.</p>
      <p>Even though, his side lost a few quick wickets after his dismissal — he was caught and bowled by the seasoned Arnab Nandi — Vinay ensured that there was no change in the script.</p>
      <p>Earlier, opener Vivek Singh struck 43, before another middle order collapse hurt Bengal. Even though it lost opener Shreevats Goswami early in the innings for just two, Vivek added 41 for the second wicket with captain Abhimanyu Easwaran, who chipped in with 28. But things changed after their dismissal.</p>
      <p>With Suresh Kumar claiming four wickets, the Bengal batsmen failed to show resilience. From 55 for one, Bengal was suddenly reeling at 100 for five. But it managed to go past the 130-run mark, riding on Arnab Nandy’s unbeaten 21. But in the end, that mattered very little for Bengal as it failed to make it to the next stage.</p>
      <p>Despite a promising start, inconsistent performances hurt Bengal in yet another major tournament. Even though it has to play Assam in its last league match on Monday, it would just be a formality for Easwaran’s men.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The scores:</b>
