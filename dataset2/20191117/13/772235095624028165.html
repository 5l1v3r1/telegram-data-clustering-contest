      <p><b>Darcy Foster • Peugeot</b> has confirmed it intends to go racing at <b>Le Mans</b> in <b>2020,</b> joining Aston Martin, Toyota and Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in the World Endurance Championship’s new top-tier category.</p>
      <p>As per FIA regulations, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/peugeot/">Peugeot</a> must homologate its incoming prototype racer by producing twenty road-legal cars over two years, which means a hypercar from performance arm Peugeot Sport is surely on the way.</p>
      <p>There's no word on what might power the French make’s newest contender, but WEC regulations stipulate a hybrid-powertrain must be used. Beyond that, engine choices are largely up to the manufacturer.</p>
      <p>While all entrants in the new hypercar class will require electrical assistance, engine choices are already markedly distinct between manufacturers</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/740012/almost-driven-aston-martin-valkyrie/">Aston Martin Valkyrie</a> (below) features a 6.5-litre, naturally-aspirated V12, while the Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus SCG 007 will reportedly use a 3.0-litre, twin-turbo V6.</p>

      <p>After losing <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/aston-martin/">Aston Martin</a> in 2010, and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/porsche/">Porsche</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/audi/">Audi</a> pulling out on the back of Dieselgate, the FIA announced the end of LMP1 class in June this year – in its place committing to a new, as-yet unnamed hypercar category.</p>
      <p>The new rules and regulations have been established to attract more manufacturers to the WEC, and allow teams greater technical freedom.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin has since rejoined, committing its Valkyrie hypercar to the championship, while new entrant Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus will field its SGC 007 chassis.</p>
      <p>Toyota is staying on after winning Le Mans and the 2018-19 WEC Championship; its car potentially underpinned by the 2018 GR Super Sports concept. It's expected to stick with the 2.4-litre hybrid powertrain used in its current LMP1 prototype.</p>
      <p>Both McLaren and Mercedes-Benz have expressed interest in the series, potentially homologating the Senna and Project One for competition respectively.</p>
      <p>Peugeot has enjoyed previous success at Le Mans, winning in <b>1992</b> with the <b>V10-powered 905</b>, and in 2009 with the <b>twin-turbo V12, 908 HDi FAP.</b></p>
