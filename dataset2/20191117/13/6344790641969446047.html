      <h1>MGM Partners with Plex for New AVOD Streaming Service</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T13:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy Williams</a></address>
      <p>Plex is a media streaming service and they’re working on a free AVOD library that will launch by the end of the year. The latest additions to this library are MGM films. We don’t have a full list, but it does include Oscar winners as well as cult classics with some examples being <b><i>Rain Man</i></b>, <b><i>The Terminator</i></b>, and <b><i>Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey</i></b>. MGM joins Warner Bros., Lionsgate, and Legendary in the list of studios working with the streaming service.</p>
      <p>This new service will be free, and that means it will be ad-supported. That being said, Plex has promised that ad breaks will be shorter than what you would experience if you were watching shows or movies on your TV through your cable provider. You can learn more about the upcoming AVOD service on the <a href="https://www.plex.tv/ad/stream-free-tv-and-movies/">official site</a>.</p>
