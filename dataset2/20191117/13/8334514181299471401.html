      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - Bank workers in Lebanon will remain on strike on Monday, the president of the Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees told broadcaster MTV on Sunday, extending industrial action that has kept banks shut nationwide.</p>
      <p>The union began the strike on Tuesday over safety fears, as protests against political leaders sweep Lebanon and depositors demand access to their money after banks imposed new curbs.</p>
