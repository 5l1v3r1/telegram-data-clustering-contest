        <i>Some of the opinions in the City Press Voices section this week:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Obsession with poverty sexification</b>
      </p>
      <p>Author Sihle Khumalo urges those who keep sexifying poverty, especially if you have never lived the poverty experience, to please stop it.</p>
      <p>If you have your demons you have to deal with regarding the injustices of the past, try different avenues to sort yourself out.</p>
      <p>But poverty sexification should not be one of those. There is nothing sexy about poverty.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Human rights, sovereignty are two sides of same coin</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Africa cannot interfere in the affairs of other countries, but it can use diplomacy as well as multilateral platforms and instruments to persuade and help them find appropriate solutions, writes Deputy President David Mabuza.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Divisive politics is a societal cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>While political leaders expend energy and resources insidiously, they relegate the real project of nation-building and create a vacuum that is quickly filled by those with nefarious intent, writes Modidima Mannya.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Africa can lead in fashion and clothing</b>
      </p>
      <p>The masterplan for the fashion, textile and clothing industry could be what South Africa needs to lead the pack and be a force to be reckon with, writes AFI founder Precious Moloi-Motsepe</p>
      <p><b>Book extract:</b> ‘<b>The struggle continues till Babylon falls!</b>’</p>
      <p>This is the story of Robert McBride and his comrades: the substation sabotage sprees; rescuing a compatriot from hospital and smuggling him to Botswana; the devastating Why Not Bar and Magoo’s car bomb that killed three women; the dramatic trial; and McBride’s 1 463 days on death row.</p>
