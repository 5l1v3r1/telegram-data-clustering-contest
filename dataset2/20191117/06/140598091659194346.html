      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the base</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>220g butter, softened</li>
        <li>70g sugar</li>
        <li>200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>30g ground almonds</li>
        <li>50g cornflour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the topping</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>400g frozen cranberries, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>120g butter, softened</li>
        <li>120g sugar</li>
        <li>Grated zest of 1 orange</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>170g ground almonds</li>
        <li>30g plain flour</li>
        <li>¼ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>45g brown sugar</li>
        <li>About 30g flaked almonds</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/Gas 4. Line a 20 x 30cm cake tin with baking paper.</li>
        <li>For the base, whisk the butter and sugar until creamy. Combine the flour, ground almonds, cornflour and salt in a separate bowl and add to the butter mixture. Combine everything to a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and roll out to the size of the tin or gently press flat with your hands. Line the tin with the dough. Prick the base all over with a fork and bake for about 17 minutes. Leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Spread the cooled base with the cranberries, leaving a small border all around. Whisk the butter and sugar until creamy, then stir in the orange zest and eggs. Combine the ground almonds, flour, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl and quickly stir into the wet mixture.</li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture on top of the cranberries and level. Sprinkle with half the brown sugar and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the flaked almonds and bake for another 25–30 minutes. A skewer or toothpick inserted into the centre should come out clean. If the almond flakes get too dark, loosely cover the tin with foil towards the end of the baking time.</li>
        <li>Remove the cake from the oven and immediately sprinkle with the remaining brown sugar. Leave to cool in the tin before cutting into individual pieces.</li>
      </ol>
