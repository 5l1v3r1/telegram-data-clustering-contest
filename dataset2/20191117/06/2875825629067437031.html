      <h1>Conor Hourihane explains why he liked what he saw from Ireland young guns in training</h1>
      <h2>Troy Parrott, Lee O’Connor and Jack Byrne all made their full senior bows at the Aviva Stadium last Thursday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>The old saying respect your elders shouldn’t apply in football, reckons Conor Hourihane.</p>
      <p>And that’s why he thinks Ireland’s new kids will be alright on the international stage.</p>
      <p>Troy Parrott, Lee O’Connor and Jack Byrne all made their full senior bows at the Aviva Stadium last Thursday.</p>
      <p>But Hourihane liked what he saw from the youngsters around the set-up all week - particularly from Spurs striker Parrott, who was involved for the first time but showed no deference to older, more experienced colleagues in training.</p>
      <p>“Listen, you all judge them on how they do the pitch but we see a little bit more of them and how they conduct themselves in terms of the right attitude, good in training, sharp in training,” said Hourihane.</p>
      <p>“I always like the guy who gives out to the older guy for not passing to them! So, they’ve all been great.</p>
      <p>“I’m good friends with John Egan, he said to me during the week that when Troy is up against him, he gives him a hard time with his movement.</p>
      <p>“And when John has passed the ball, he might leave a little bit on him to let him know he’s around. He’s been great.”</p>
      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Hourihane added: “Definitely, the young lads have been fantastic, Troy has come in and looked really lively in training.</p>
      <p>“Someone like Jack who has had a great year with (Shamrock) Rovers and you can see in training that he’s full of confidence.</p>
      <p>“The young lads have been great in geneal and it’s always nice to see them come through, showing that sharpness in training and keep lads on their toes.”</p>
