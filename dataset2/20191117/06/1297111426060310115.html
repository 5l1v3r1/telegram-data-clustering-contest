      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:46:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>The Regina Pats have been pushed around by the Prince Albert Raiders for the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, they pushed back.</p>
      <p>Regina completed one of the biggest upsets in the league this season with a 4-3 shootout win over the defending WHL champions before an enthusiastic crowd of 4,780 at the Brandt Centre.</p>
      <p>“It’s always good beating P.A.,” said Pats captain Austin Pratt. “They hate us, we hate them. It’s one of those teams that you always want to win against and we’ve shown that we can definitely play with them.”</p>
      <p>With the victory, Regina improved to 3-12-2-0 while the East Division-leading Raiders fell to 13-4-3-1.</p>
      <p>Regina entered Saturday’s contest with a 1-8-0 record versus Prince Albert over the past two seasons. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/pats-shock-top-ranked-raiders">The lone victory was a massive 2-1 upset at the Art Hauser Centre on Dec. 30</a>, handing P.A. its first home loss of the season.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s triumph might have been just as big for the Pats’ morale.</p>
      <p>“It was definitely a special night,” said forward Ty Kolle, who scored Regina’s first goal of the night before adding the shootout winner. “P.A. is a good team but everybody is telling us that we’re better than our record. We’ve been playing amazing the last however many games. Everybody is working hard and it feels really good to finally get it, especially against these guys because they’re so strong.”</p>
      <p>The Pats lost their first three meetings with Prince Albert this season by a combined score of 17-5.</p>
      <p>However, the Raiders had their hands full in at least two of those contests.</p>
      <p>“That’s because they work hard,” noted P.A. head coach Marc Habscheid. “They play structured and they work hard. When you do that, you’re going to give yourself a chance. You look at their record and (the players think) it’s going to be easy. You can say what you want about whatever, but they deserved to win.”</p>
      <p>Prince Albert opened the scoring midway through the first period with a goal by Kaiden Guhle. Kolle responded 3:22 later and Carter Chorney gave Regina the lead just 1:38 after that, redirecting a point shot past Boston Bilous.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/searching-for-more-firepower-regina-pats-pull-the-trigger-on-trade-for-carter-chorney">It was Chorney’s first game after being acquired Wednesday from the Swift Current Broncos</a>. The goal snapped a personal 16-game drought that dated back to opening night with the Broncos.</p>
      <p>“I was pretty happy for it to go in,” Chorney said with a smile. “(The drought) was kind of in the back of my head. It’s good to get it out of the way.”</p>
      <p>Logan Nijhoff gave the Pats a 3-1 lead just 4:09 into the second but Reece Vitelli got one back with 7:16 left in the frame, beating Max Paddock on a partial breakaway.</p>
      <p>After Aliaksei Protas tied it 6:39 into the third, the Pats thought they had regained the lead with 7:06 left in the frame when Bilous’ clearing attempt hit Austin Pratt in front. Kolle jumped on the loose puck and scored, but the goal was overturned after a lengthy video review due to a “hand pass” by Pratt.</p>
      <p>“They must have had a better video feed upstairs because the six (angles) that we saw up top (on the scoreboard) didn’t show conclusive evidence that it was a gloved pass,” said Pats head coach Dave Struch. “It might have gone off his elbow. There was nothing that showed from what we saw that it was a glove and they called it a goal (on the ice). In the rules of hockey, the goal on the ice should stand unless there’s something conclusive upstairs.”</p>
      <p>The Pats were awarded a subsequent power play with one minute left in regulation but they failed to capitalize. P.A. also received a man advantage with 1:15 left in OT but the result was the same, forcing a shootout.</p>
      <p>Kolle scored the eventual game-winner on the first attempt. Paddock handled the rest by stopping all three shooters he faced, sealing the victory along with a first-star effort.</p>
      <p>Regina’s penalty kill earned a big assist with a 7-for-8 performance, highlighted by a two-man disadvantage for 1:51 late in the second period.</p>
      <p>The Pats went 0-for-4 on the power play and were outshot 36-27, but they found a way to persevere.</p>
      <p>“Guys sold out for the win and they did everything they could,” Pratt added. “We made some mistakes but that’s going to happen. Everyone battled (hard) and that’s the biggest thing.”</p>
      <p><b>NOTE</b>: The Pats lost F Carter Massier to an undisclosed injury in the first period. There was no immediate word on his status for Tuesday’s home game against the Swift Current Broncos. That contest was rescheduled from Nov. 8 due to an ice issue.</p>
