      <p><b>BANGKOK — </b>The United States and South Korea on Sunday said they were postponing a joint military air exercise that North Korea has criticized as provocative.</p>
      <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and his South Korean counterpart made the announcement in Bangkok, where they were attending an Asia defense ministers’ conference.</p>
      <p>Esper told reporters he did not consider the postponement a concession to North Korea.</p>
      <p>“We have made this decision as an act of goodwill to contribute to an environment conducive to diplomacy and the advancement of peace,” Esper said.</p>
      <p>As recently as Friday, when Esper was in Seoul to consult with South Korean officials, there was no word on postponing the military air exercise, which had been called Vigilant Ace.</p>
      <p>Seoul and Washington had scaled back the exercise recently and changed the name, but North Korea strongly objected, calling it evidence of a lack of interest in improving relations.</p>
      <p>The North has demanded accommodations before it will agree to resume nuclear negotiations.</p>
      <p>South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo said the exercise had been put off pending further consultations between Seoul and Washington. No new date has been set.</p>
      <p>“I see this as a good-faith effort by the United States and the Republic of Korea to enable peace ... to facilitate a political agreement, a deal if you will, that leads to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Esper said.</p>
      <p>He said Seoul and Washington encourage North Korea “to demonstrate the same goodwill” as it considers decisions on its own military training, exercises and testing.</p>
      <p>He also urged the North to return to the negotiating table “without precondition or hesitation.”</p>
      <p>Esper said that even without the planned exercise of South Korean and American air forces, both militaries “will remain at a high state of readiness” for potential combat.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has about 28,000 troops in South Korea.</p>
