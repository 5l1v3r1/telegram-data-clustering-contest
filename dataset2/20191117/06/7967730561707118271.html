      <p>The NBL has ordered the NZ Breakers to stand down controversial import Glen Rice Jnr from Sunday's match against Perth over a bar incident.</p>
      <p>Former NBA player Rice was reportedly arrested after an altercation early on Thursday at an Auckland bar, just 10 days after his arrival as an injury replacement.</p>
