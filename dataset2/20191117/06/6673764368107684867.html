      <p><b>PARIS – </b>The Netherlands, Germany and World Cup finalists Croatia expanded a list of big hitters to qualify for Euro 2020 on Saturday as the trio booked their places at next summer’s finals.</p>
      <p>Austria also made it through to the tournament, which kicks off in Rome on June 12, with 16 sides now ensured of a spot at the 24-team event and only four places remaining from the main qualifying route.</p>
      <p>They join other big names such as world champion France, Spain, Italy and England, with European champions Portugal one win away from qualification.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman’s resurgent Dutch needed a point to qualify for their first major tournament since coming third at the 2014 World Cup and got what they needed in a scrappy scoreless draw with Northern Ireland in Belfast.</p>
      <p>“It means a lot for us as players. Hopefully it means so much to the Dutch people,” Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk said.</p>
      <p>However Netherlands was far from the flamboyant outfit that has so often thrilled in Group C, and survived a huge scare when Steven Davis smashed a first-half penalty high over the bar.</p>
      <p>The Dutch dominated possession and stopped the hosts from having a single shot on target but failed to create much themselves.</p>
      <p>Davis’ spot-kick blunder left Michael O’Neill’s side third and hoping for a way into the tournament via the playoffs.</p>
      <p>The draw allowed fierce rival Germany to move atop of the group as Toni Kroos hit a brace in a simple 4-0 win over Belarus in Moenchengladbach, Germany, which saw the host qualify for a 13th straight continental tournament.</p>
      <p>A deft back-heeled goal from defender Matthias Ginter just before the break and impressive finishing by Leon Goretzka and Kroos gave the Germans a comfortable three-goal lead early in the second half.</p>
      <p>Captain Manuel Neuer produced a superb save to keep out Belarus striker Igor Stasevich’s penalty before Kroos dribbled through the defense to claim his second goal seven minutes from time and make sure of a routine win.</p>
      <p>“Overall we did well, but at the moment I don’t include us among the favorites for the European title,” said Kroos, echoing coach Joachim Loew’s comments from earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>A win over Northern Ireland in Frankfurt, Germany on Tuesday will guarantee Loew’s new-look side first place.</p>
      <p>Croatia survived a scare to secure their place in the Euros after coming from behind beat Slovakia 3-1 in Rijeka.</p>
      <p>The World Cup runner-up needed just a point to ensure qualification from Group E but Robert Bozenik stunned the home crowd when he tapped the away side ahead in the 32nd minute.</p>
      <p>However it was one-way traffic in the second half and Croatia’s qualification was never in doubt once Nikola Vlasic drilled home the equalizer.</p>
      <p>Bruno Petkovic headed the host in front and Ivan Perisic sealed the three points with a thumping finish with 16 minutes left.</p>
      <p>“We were trying to stay calm in the dressing room at half-time, we were sure that our quality would prevail. We kept attacking, creating chances, and the goals came,” said Petkovic.</p>
      <p>That win gives Wales a fighting chance of qualifying after its 2-0 victory over Azerbaijan earlier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs’ side stayed in third thanks to first-half headed goals from Kieffer Moore and Harry Wilson and Slovakia losing against the Croats.</p>
      <p>Wales is just one point behind second-placed Hungary, which travels to Cardiff on the final day for a winner-takes-all clash.</p>
      <p>“It’s massive for us to get the three points and now we go again Tuesday,” said Moore. “We came here for the three points and we got them — now it’s all guns blazing towards Tuesday.”</p>
      <p>Austria booked its place with a 2-1 win over North Macedonia that kept third-placed Slovenia at bay despite that side’s 1-0 triumph over Latvia.</p>
      <p>The Austrians are second in Group G behind Poland, which had already qualified going into this round of games but maintained a three-point lead at the top of the group thanks to a 2-1 win at Israel.</p>
      <p>In Saint Petersburg, Russia, the Hazard brothers made short work of Russia as already qualified Belgium maintained its perfect record with a 4-1 win that secured the top spot in Group I.</p>
      <p>Eden and Thorgan Hazard put Roberto Martinez’s side three goals ahead at the break before in-form Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku crashed home the fourth in the 72nd minute to make absolutely sure of the result.</p>
