      <h1>Job done but plenty to work on for Leo Cullen and Leinster after Benetton win</h1>
      <h2>Last year's losing finalists scored five tries at the RDS as the majority of their World Cup contingent returned</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Job done with plenty more to do was Leo Cullen's verdict as Garry Ringrose bagged a hat-trick and Leinster opened this year's Champions Cup account with a home bonus point win.</p>
      <p>Last year's losing finalists scored five tries at the RDS as the majority of their World Cup contingent returned and got a competitive encounter under their belts ahead of a difficult trip to Lyon next weekend.</p>
      <p>“It was a proper game," said Cullen. "We're in winter rugby and Treviso are a very physical team.</p>
      <p>“There are parts of our performance that can be a hell of a lot better. But overall, we're pleased to get a win, which keeps us trucking along.</p>
      <p>"Listen, they're a good team - they hang there as well, so it wasn't much of a shock, really.</p>
      <p>"We were nervous about today. It's a tricky time of the year for us.</p>
      <p>"Everyone thinks that everything's going well but there's a certain reality that bringing back in a large group when we're already up and running has it's challenges.</p>
      <p>"It's another week into the system and get guys up to what we're trying to do. But it wasn't perfect out there."</p>

      <p>The Blues wrapped up the bonus point after 45 minutes in front of a 15,080 attendance,</p>
      <p>Ringrose was exceptional and Johnny Sexton looked in the mood as Leinster's World Cup stars shook off some of their disappointment by putting Benetton to the sword.</p>
      <p>The hosts made a late change at centre with Rory O'Loughlin replacing hamstring victim Joe Tomane.</p>
      <p>But they were quickly into their stride, with Ringrose pouncing for the first try of their campaign in the fifth minute.</p>
      <p>Sexton's conversion miss from a tough spot would be the only blot on his record.</p>
      <p>As a reminder, however, that the gradually improving Italians had caused the Blues bother over the last couple of seasons, Dean Budd twisted in the tackle off a lineout drive to restore parity - and ex-Munster ace Ian Keatley added the extras.</p>
      <p>But Leinster's lead was restored on the quarter hour when Ringrose conjured up his second try, powering through Benetton skipper Alberto Sgarbi's challenge.</p>
      <p>A superb lineout steal by Devin Toner halted the visitors on Leinster's five metre line before hooker Ronan Kelleher, making his European debut, scored his seventh try in his six games from close range.</p>
      <p>Sexton's conversion made it 19-7 and while Keatley had a chance to reduce the deficit before the break, his long-range penalty fell short.</p>

      <p>And Sexton pushed home the hosts' advantage four minutes after the restart.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old sprinted through a gap in midfield and Josh van der Flier was very unselfish to return a pass to Sexton to score the crucial fourth try.</p>
      <p>The five points secured, Leinster fell asleep at the wheel and conceded a second try when Hame Faiva charged through for a converted try in the 51st minute.</p>
      <p>But dogged defence then kept the Italians at bay as they looked for the lifeline of a third try.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was Leinster who scored next with the outstanding Ringrose delivering again, running an unstoppable line to finish - before Benetton finished the scoring through Luca Sperandio late on.</p>
