      <h1>Qantas 737 forced to make emergency landing at New Zealand military base</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:14:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>A Qantas airliner was forced to make an emergency landing at a New Zealand military base on Saturday, leaving passengers stranded in a sweltering cabin for four hours as emergency work was carried out on the plane.</p>
      <p>The Boeing 737 jet was travelling from Melbourne to Wellington when it developed a mechanical issue and the pilots decided to land at Ohakea military base, 150 kilometres north of Wellington.</p>
      <p>The plane was unable to land flight QF171 at nearby Palmerston North airport due to local weather conditions.</p>
      <p>Passengers on-board were not allowed to leave the aircraft as customs officials made the two-hour trip from Wellington.</p>
      <p>A woman whose partner was aboard the plane told the <i>Sydney Morning Herald </i>the aircraft apparently had a problem with its the “wing flaps”.</p>
      <p>“They couldn’t get them to work,” she was quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>Posts on social media indicate the passengers waited four hours on the plane before eventually being taken by bus to their destination.</p>
      <p>One passenger, Ryan Newington, tweeted that it was “extremely hot” in the plane and said there had been “shocking communication” from the airline during the wait.</p>

      <p>Mr Newington told TV New Zealand that the pilot informed passengers the plane was diverted due to a wing flap being stuck.</p>
      <p>Another passenger tweeted it was a “difficult problem to solve”.</p>
      <p>“Can’t leave plane because no customs, can’t fly plane as broken, can’t get replacement plane (easily at least) as at air base,” she wrote on Twitter.</p>
