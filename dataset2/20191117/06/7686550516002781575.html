      <h1>The £15m victim of Swansea City's tactical switch and why he's gone off the radar once again</h1>
      <h2>He hasn't done anything wrong, argues our Swans columnist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Guto Llewelyn</a></address>
      <p>The international fortnight has given most of the Swansea City squad a breather but for one player in particular, a break is the last thing he needs.</p>
      <p>Borja Baston went from unwanted big-money flop to goal-scoring sensation within the blink of an eye at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>However having seemingly fallen down the pecking order over recent weeks he risks once again becoming a forgotten man.</p>
      <p>The former Spanish youth international was once tipped to represent his country at senior level. The season before joining Swansea he scored 18 goals in La Liga for minnows Eibar, making him the third highest scoring Spaniard in the league that year.</p>
      <p>The striker’s superb scoring record turned a few heads and when he moved to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-city-fc">Swansea</a> in the summer of 2016, fans couldn’t help but get excited.</p>
      <p>Borja became the Swans’ record signing, and the £15.5million man must have thought it was another step towards stardom but rather than propel him to new heights, the move threw his career off a cliff.</p>
      <p>Very little has gone right for Borja since that fateful summer.</p>
      <p>The 2016-17 season proved to be arguably one of the most chaotic in the club’s history with three different permanent managers, uproar in the stands over a controversial takeover and the team requiring a miraculous escape to avoid relegation. This tumultuous environment clearly didn’t benefit Borja who only played in half of Swansea’s league games, often got selected out of position and scored just one goal.</p>
      <p>He found himself unwanted so spent the next two seasons on loan in his homeland, firstly with Malaga then Alaves, desperately trying to rediscover the form which first drew interest from Swansea.</p>
      <p>In those two seasons he netted just six goals and spent most of his time on the bench.</p>
      <p>There is no way could Borja have possibly envisaged such a disastrous turn of events when he upped sticks and first moved to Wales.</p>
      <p>But when new Swans boss Steve Cooper opened the door for an unlikely return in the summer it seemed Borja’s luck was on the verge of turning.</p>
      <p>He began the season with a bang, scoring the side’s first goal of the campaign in the opening-day win against Hull. He went on to score four goals in his following four matches.</p>
      <p>He was even nominated for the Championship’s player of the month award in August as he ended the month the division’s top scorer.</p>

      <p>Borja seemed to have found his feet again and was playing with confidence. He was a big reason why Swansea found themselves top of the league heading into the first international break.</p>
      <p>September arrived and Swansea’s form dipped. They won one of their following seven games and Borja scored just once in that disappointing run.</p>
      <p>He was dropped for the first time away at Barnsley although he came on to play the final quarter of an hour.</p>
      <p>He started the following game against Brentford but has not played a single minute in the last three games.</p>
      <p>Cooper has modified his approach over recent weeks, picking Andre Ayew as the main striker ahead of Borja.</p>
      <p>Despite Borja’s fine goal-scoring record this term, this decision is understandable. Ayew’s energy and greater mobility has given Swansea an extra dimension in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Borja is a clinical finisher but outside the box he’s nowhere near as effective as Ayew.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard works his socks off every match and has clearly tried to improve various aspect of his game including his hold-up play but Ayew contributes more to Swansea’s build-up play and gives them greater fluidity.</p>

      <p>Ayew and Borja are very different strikers and Cooper clearly feels the Ghanaian can provide different qualities which Borja does not possess.</p>
      <p>But Borja’s concerns may not end with him losing his starting spot. Over recent games he’s not even left the bench, even when Swansea have been chasing late goals.</p>
      <p>Against Wigan and Sheffield Wednesday Cooper chose to introduce on-loan Bournemouth youngster Sam Surridge ahead of Borja. Cooper’s faith in Surridge was rewarded with the late winner against Wigan and Surridge also caused a few problems a week later at Hillsborough.</p>
      <p>Borja may now be Swansea’s third-choice striker even though he’s not done much wrong in the first three months of the season, he’s just the victim of a tactical adjustment which does not favour a striker like him.</p>
      <p>Borja is an old fashioned fox in the box, an expert at finding the back of the net. He gets into good positions and takes his chances but because he’s not as effective around the rest of the pitch he once again finds himself out of favour.</p>
      <p>It’s a strange situation for Borja to be in. He’s still among the top 10 scorers in the Championship however he has gradually fallen off the radar of late.</p>
      <p>The tactical switch seems to have worked out well because after a poor run of form the Swans have taken seven points from their last three games, with their leading marksman not playing a single minute. But the former Atletico Madrid man remains an asset for Swansea even if they can’t find room for him in the current system.</p>
      <p>Ayew may have taken his place at the tip of the Swans’ attack but Borja still has plenty to contribute. It must be frustrating for him to once again be stuck on the sidelines, watching rather than playing, but there will always be room for a finisher of his quality in this division.</p>
