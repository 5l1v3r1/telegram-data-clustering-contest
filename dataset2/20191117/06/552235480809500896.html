      <h1>John McGinn on Aston Villa myths he's debunked and the Jack Grealish hobby he doesn't rate</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder is loving proving everyone wrong in the Premier League.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>A rat and a runner – that’s how <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> viewed himself when he played in Scotland.</p>
      <p>As humble a footballer as you’ll come across, self-deprecation comes naturally to him.</p>
      <p>But that’s how he was pigeonholed as a kid at St Mirren and later on at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a>.</p>
      <p>A grafter, an ankle biter, a midfield buzz-bomb who got around the pitch at 100mph.</p>
      <p>But watch him now for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>, playing further forward in Dean Smith’s side and supporting his front players.</p>
      <p>Sure, he’s still got the energy and work ethic he’s always had.</p>
      <p>But it’s more controlled now, more measured.</p>

      <p>If you run about like a headless chicken in a league with the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Fabinho, Youri Tielemans and David Silva, they’ll play around you.</p>
      <p>Instead, McGinn has learned to pick his moments.</p>
      <p>With the likes of Jack Grealish and Douglas Costa beside him in Villa’s engine room, he can afford to.</p>
      <p>And he’s reaping the benefits. Not only is he building a reputation as one of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League</a>’s top midfielders, he’s also cemented his place in Steve Clarke’s Scotland line-up.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Now the national boss is also deploying him in an advanced role – which saw him net three against San Marino in October and one against Cyprus yesterday.</p>
      <p>McGinn would have laughed if you’d called him a creative, attacking midfielder a few years ago.</p>

      <p>But not now. Thanks to Smith’s coaching, quality team-mates and the intensity of England’s top-flight, he has changed his game.</p>
      <p>And as McGinn prepares to take on Kazakhstan at Hampden on Tuesday night, the 25-year-old said: “If you thought I could play further forward a few years ago, I’d have laughed.</p>
      <p>“I probably got sucked into the idea in Scotland that I was just a rat and a runner.</p>
      <p>“But Dean has given me the confidence to get involved higher up the park and I’m enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“I’m still learning and I have so much to improve on if I want to play in that position at Premier League level.</p>
      <p>“But it’s good that I’m getting games there at my club to hopefully benefit me with Scotland.</p>
      <p>“When I played for Hibs, it was probably the most erratic I’ve ever been. But at Villa, you’re not allowed to do that. You have a certain role in the team.</p>

      <p>“At Hibs, there were times when I tried to do a lot of things myself.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t as well drilled or coached as I am now. I’ve learned more about the game down here.</p>
      <p>“I pick my times not to go and chase opponents. I used to do it too much.</p>
      <p>“Now, I just listen to the coaches. The manager has been brilliant for me. He’s told me to trust in myself and show a bit of character.</p>
      <p>“I feel I’ve added that to my game now. It’s hard to get a <br/>balance because I don’t want to lose what I’m known for, the energy and bustle.</p>
      <p>“I need to be the same type of player – but fine tune it. Down south, you see players getting older with so much coaching and they’re scared to do things.</p>
      <p>“I’m not keen to be overly coached and I still want to separate myself from other players in the league because I definitely feel I can offer something different.</p>
      <p>“Don’t ask about my shooting, though. I shoot a lot more now and get pelters off the lads for it.</p>
      <p>“But I need to get my fantasy football points up.”</p>

      <p>McGinn’s humour is just one of the reasons why he’s now one of the most popular figures in the Aston Villa dressing room.</p>
      <p>A blossoming friendship with Villa skipper and England hopeful Grealish is testament to that.</p>
      <p>His impact should be proof that Scotland can boast talented players but McGinn admits that it’s still a battle convincing some people.</p>
      <p>He said: “Their criticism of Scottish football doesn’t hurt me. It gives me motivation <br/>to prove them wrong every weekend. I’m craving success with the national team so I can finally go back down there with a big smile on my face.</p>
      <p>“Too many times I’ve gone down the road off the back of a poor result. But we know we <br/>have the ability in the squad to change that.</p>
      <p>“English people’s view of the Scottish game is something I don’t think we’ll ever change.</p>
      <p>“But Celtic and Rangers’ results against the likes of Lazio and Porto in Europe helps me an awful lot when I go to training on a Friday morning.</p>
      <p>“Jack is someone I’ve hit it off with. We have similar interests. Not sunbeds, though – he’s the good looking one.</p>
      <p>“But we both love our football so we stay at the training ground to do a bit extra or watch games when they’re on.</p>
      <p>“He’s just a good guy. I get on with most of the boys but he’s of a similar age so I cut about with Jack a lot.”</p>

      <p>One of those poor Scotland results McGinn talks about was the 3-0 humiliation in Kazakhstan that kicked off our dismal Euro 2020 campaign.</p>
      <p>That defeat all but ended our hopes of qualifying via the conventional route – and signalled the end of Alex McLeish’s second reign as gaffer.</p>
      <p>For McGinn, it was his worst night in a dark blue shirt – and it’s why he’s determined to put it right in midweek.</p>
      <p>He said: “That night was probably the lowest point in my Scotland career.</p>
      <p>“It was such an important game but the Scotland team went down without a whimper.</p>
      <p>“It still hurts and is a massive reason why we can’t qualify from the group. It couldn’t have gone any worse.</p>
      <p>“This game gives us an opportunity to put it right.</p>
      <p>“All the Scottish fans want to see are players giving everything.</p>
      <p>“We’ve not given them enough to smile about and that’s what we want to change.”</p>
