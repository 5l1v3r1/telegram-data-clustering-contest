      <p>A security guard drank three quarters of a bottle of vodka before taking two friends to McDonald's for an early morning drive-thru, a court heard.</p>
      <p>James Hall had consumed the booze between 8pm and 6am before getting "the munchies" and heading to the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/blaydon">Blaydon</a> takeaway for a sausage and egg McMuffin.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside">South Tyneside</a> Magistrates Court heard that staff at McDonalds raised the alarm and police arrived to find him and two female friends eating their breakfasts in the car.</p>
      <p>Hall, 29, later refused to provide a breath sample and has now been handed a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to failing to provide a specimen.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Clare Irving said on September 14 police officers attended McDonald's in Blaydon at about 5.45am.</p>
      <p>She told the court: "Staff reported they had concerns for a male in the drive-thru and that he was driving whilst drunk</p>
      <p>"Officers located the vehicle in the car park - the defendant was still in the driver’s seat and was asked to come out of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>"Officers said it was quite clear he was drunk, he showed all the usual signs of being drunk.</p>
      <p>"He was asked to provide a specimen but didn’t blow when he was required.</p>
      <p>"The defendant was cautioned and arrested for failing to provide a specimen.</p>
      <p>"He was taken to a police station where he was abusive to officers throughout the procedure, and also to their family members.</p>
      <p>"He was asked to provide a specimen and refused."</p>
      <p>Peter Farrier, defending, said Hall had been at work from 12pm to 6pm in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/consett">Consett</a> the day before, and went to the home of two female friends in Chopwell, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Farrier told the court: "He says he probably had three quarters of a bottle of vodka between 6pm and 8am.</p>
      <p>"He doesn’t argue he was in drink but he says he wasn’t, on his own scale, drunk as such.</p>
      <p>"At 6am there was a bright idea among those who were there to go to McDonald's - there's that little bit of extra salt in your food when you’re hungry and they had the munchies.</p>
      <p>"He was nominated as the driver and took two girls with him. They are 22 and 24 years old."</p>
      <p>Mr Farrier said when the police arrived, "One of the officers who was present asked the girls how old they were and whether they were on the missing list.</p>
      <p>"He says unfortunately that was like a red rag to him and he massively overreacted. He found the implication abhorrent.</p>
      <p>"In his mind he was being accused of something he absolutely wouldn’t do.</p>
      <p>"He accepts he’s guilty and apologises for his conduct."</p>
      <p>District judge Natalie Wortley sentenced Hall, of Lyne Close, Chester-le-Street, to eight weeks in prison suspended for 12 months, banned him from driving for 29 months and ordered him to carry out 15 days rehabilitation activity and 200 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>She told him: "It is so serious a custodial sentence is appropriate but I will suspend it because there is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation."</p>
