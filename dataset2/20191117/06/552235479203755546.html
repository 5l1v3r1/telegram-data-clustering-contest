      <h1>Neil Lennon admits Rangers' return to challenge Celtic is the fire that fuels his relentless trophy hunt</h1>
      <h2>The Parkhead boss is enjoying his second stint in the job and reveals the circumstances that drove his departure the first time around.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> first sent shockwaves around Europe as Celtic boss – he had ambitions further afield.</p>
      <p>After losing the core of his team that beat Barcelona in the Champions League in 2012, the Parkhead gaffer also wanted out.</p>
      <p>After a dire stint at Bolton that forced him to rebuild his reputation at Hibs, most people would expect Lennon to regret that decision.</p>
      <p>But he doesn’t. Not even after two sensational victories over Lazio in the Europa League, including that historic 2-1 win in Rome.</p>
      <p>Lennon refuses to look back. Instead, those results have made him realise that he never wants to leave the Hoops of his own accord ever again.</p>
      <p>He appreciates what he’s got at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> – and that’s why he’s savouring every moment of their current run.</p>
      <p>As well as their European exploits, Lennon is embroiled in a title fight with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> again – something he didn’t have back in 2014 when the Ibrox club were in Scotland’s lower leagues.</p>
      <p>As he reflected on his first stint as manager and what transpired, he said: “Have the Lazio nights made me ask myself why I left here in the first place?</p>
      <p>“Listen, I had my reasons for leaving at that time.</p>
      <p>“I don’t regret it because it was the right thing for me to do at that moment in my career.</p>
      <p>“I was ambitious then and wanted to try other things. But I feel differently now.</p>

      <p>“After Barcelona we changed the squad, sold a lot of good players – and there was no Rangers.</p>
      <p>“In my last year, we won the league by 29 points so you’re thinking: ‘Is it time for me to change and time for the club to make a change as well.’</p>
      <p>“Maybe it needed a new voice because four years is a long time in modern football at a club like this.</p>
      <p>“So it was a good time to go.</p>
      <p>“And I left on the best of terms so the door would maybe be open again in the future. You can’t predict that but thankfully that’s how it’s turned out.</p>
      <p>“And having this opportunity again is fantastic, I’m really enjoying it.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to bring those type of big nights back to Celtic Park. And the Lazio win was the perfect storm for a European game at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>“The game matched the atmosphere, occasion, performance and result.</p>
      <p>“We got a taste against Cluj at home but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> was even better. And I want more of it.</p>
      <p>“Once you get a taste, you want the players and fans to get more nights like that.</p>
      <p>“It makes me never want to leave again. I’m older and wiser now.</p>
      <p>“Now, I’ve got a second crack at it, I’m really grateful for the opportunity.”</p>

      <p>Lennon is now embracing everything that comes from being Celtic manager.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers was a ridiculously hard act to follow.</p>
      <p>But the adulation he received in the Olympic Stadium at full-time was confirmation that he’d achieved it.</p>
      <p>He’s now got a Europa League last-32 clash, a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> Final – and a mouthwatering Premiership title race to look forward to.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “I inherited a good squad but we’ve brought in quality players. So I’m loving what I’m doing.</p>
      <p>“It’s a high-pressure job but I’m embracing the challenge.</p>
      <p>“We’re top of the league, top of our Europa League group and in a cup final so I can’t ask more of the players.</p>
      <p>“Also, the fact that Rangers are back challenging, that drives me on too. It heightens the senses and pushes me on. The way we’re playing right now is fantastic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“With these big games we’ve got coming up, I can’t ask for much more as a manager.</p>
      <p>“I can’t imagine a feeling like we had against Lazio anywhere else in football. That’s just what Celtic brings.</p>
      <p>“I talk to the players a lot about that feeling.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about money or medals, it’s about the feeling you get after a performance like that.</p>
      <p>“Only those players as individuals can experience that glow of complete satisfaction.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t last long in this game – but that’s what you play for. When you hear Lazio boss Simone Inzaghi talking about us and the atmosphere at Celtic Park, it’s a great compliment. He spoke really well after our home game.</p>
      <p>“It made me proud of the club and it meant a hell of a lot to me.”</p>
      <p>One of those quality players Lennon talks about is £7million centre-back Christopher Jullien.</p>

      <p>The former Toulouse star is a symbol of the new Lennon era at Celtic – and was pivotal in both victories over Lazio.</p>
      <p>The manager always believed the Frenchman would be a standout for his new-look side but still wants more. The Hoops gaffer said: “I always liked Christopher’s physicality, aerial threat and defensive capabilities.</p>
      <p>“And we’re now seeing that manifest itself in his performances.</p>
      <p>“He should actually have scored a few more goals by now but he’s adapting to the British game well and has performed in Europe too.</p>
      <p>“Christopher’s in a good place, and enjoying the intensity of being at Celtic.</p>
      <p>“At first, it’s a bit of a shock but players grow into it then it becomes an exciting environment to be in.</p>
      <p>“That’s what he’s beginning to experience now.”</p>
