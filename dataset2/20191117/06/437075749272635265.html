        <i>What you can expect in the City Press Business section this week:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Drought is killing South Africa’s farmers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Farmers around the country are reeling from the devastating drought.</p>
      <p>In the Northern Cape, the names of 400 commercial farmers have been handed to commercial banks to help save them from collapse.</p>
      <p>In the Eastern Cape, game farmers have reported that 80% of their animals have perished. Crop estimates have been lowered while beef farmers are killing cattle they cannot afford to feed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Economic state of the nation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Standard Bank CEO Lungisa Fuzile writes that meaningful interventions by government and the private sector are a good start. However, the time to act is now.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eskom is a national priority</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a wide ranging interview with City Press, Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan adds flesh to the Eskom Roadmap and what the options are in restructuring this key national asset.</p>
      <p>There are models for operation and even “a monopoly can be competitive”, says Gordhan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Iron will needed to save poultry industry</b>
      </p>
      <p>Massive imports from the EU, Brazil and the US have forced local poultry producers to the brink of collapse.</p>
      <p>Imports have risen by 269% since 2009, forcing the closure of 13 companies and the loss of thousands of jobs.</p>
      <p>The industry is urging government to move fast to protect local producers, including implementing tariffs on imported chicken.</p>
      <p>The government has outlined a 5-point masterplan as a response.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Owning a set of wheels</b>
      </p>
      <p>Buying a car is not simply about paying a monthly sum. There are numerous costs that are incurred, from paying a deposit, paying for insurance and fuel to ensuring you car is regularly maintained.</p>
      <p>So if you have your eye on the latest model, do your sums properly, urges Mapalo Makhu.</p>
