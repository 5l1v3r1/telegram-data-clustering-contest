      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Sources have indicated that the former Irish Army soldier turned ISIS bride, 38, will be arrested as soon as she touches down</h2>

      <p>Lisa Smith’s family want her to tell her story in a closed set interview on the Late Late Show when she returns to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Sources have indicated that the former Irish Army soldier turned ISIS bride, 38, will be arrested as soon as she touches down at Baldonnel Aerodrome on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Family spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said: “They’ve been approached by the Late Late Show and other media all looking for interviews, but Lisa told them she wants to give her own version.”</p>
      <p>The family have said they“don’t know what to expect” when she returns home next week.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith, from Dundalk in Co Louth, is due to be repatriated from Turkey and will face a security assessment and possible prosecution.</p>

      <p>Ms Smith was detained in northern Syria in March along with her two-year-old daughter, after ISIS’ downfall, on suspicion of supporting the terror group.</p>
      <p>Family spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick TD told the Irish Sunday Mirror: “They [Lisa’s family] literally don’t know what is going to happen.</p>
      <p>“They are afraid the child will be taken off her. She has said she will answer any questions whatsoever from gardai or security.</p>
      <p>“The family don’t know what to expect – basically what kind of reception she’s going to get or whether she’ll be arrested.</p>
      <p>“There’s been a lot of speculation but she just wants to come home to her country with her child, she’s very concerned for her child.”</p>
      <p>Lisa is believed to have escaped a detention camp with IS recruiter Tooba Gondal in mid-October and was held in a rebel <br/>safehouse on the Turkey-Syria border where she begged to come home.</p>

      <p>The women reportedly walked for miles with their children after fleeing Ain Issa camp when they were picked up by rebel fighters with the Syrian National Army.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year photographs emerged of Ms Smith posing with guns but she claims she has never been a member of the terror group.</p>
      <p>Mr Fitzpatrick said: “There are a lot of rumours about her.</p>
      <p>“She has been in touch with her family, mainly by text. She says she misses home and wants to come home.</p>
      <p>“Her mother has never seen her grandchild and she can’t wait to see the child.</p>
      <p>“There have been threats, yes. The reason the family don’t go public and <br/>talk is they’re afraid they might say something that makes it worse.</p>
      <p>“Lisa has told them when she comes home she will meet the public and give her version of events.</p>
      <p>“They have been approached by RTE, The Late Late and other media all looking for interviews.</p>
      <p>“They want to wait for Lisa to come home and give her version herself.</p>

      <p>“She says she’s innocent, she has an opportunity when she comes home to prove that.”</p>
      <p>Some residents in Dundalk are said to be uneasy about her return, with reports some have written to their local council to express their outrage.</p>
      <p>One source said: “She can’t just rock up as if she did nothing. People are genuinely upset about this.”</p>
      <p>RTE has been contacted for comment.</p>
