      <h1>Michael O'Neill's empathic Austin MacPhee defence should resonate within Hearts boardroom - Gordon Parks</h1>
      <h2>It was quite a ding-dong which continued on the tranny this week and perhaps MacPhee offers more than his critics would ever know.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T06:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Parks, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-parks/</a></address>
      <p>The ball had barely hit the back of the net for his side’s fifth goal of the day when the bitching began.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts’</a> romp against St Mirren offered no protection for caretaker boss and wannabe permanent gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/austin-macphee">Austin MacPhee</a> last Saturday as some pundits put the boot in.</p>
      <p>It was quite a ding-dong which continued on the tranny this week.</p>
      <p>It was so relentless Northern Ireland boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O’Neill</a> felt he had to intervene to try and bring some perspective to the criticism of his coach.</p>
      <p>He suggested some of the comments were over the ball.</p>
      <p>Whether his belief that it was all getting a bit ‘personal’ was correct is up for debate, but his defence of his mate was strong and held a fair few truths.</p>

      <p>There is a view of MacPhee that he’s a bit of a bluffer, an interloper from outside Scottish football’s norm and someone who tries to be too clever for his own good.</p>
      <p>That’s the perception of some, and having only met him a few times, maybe Willie Miller and Allan Preston do have a point.</p>
      <p>But there’s another side to the coin – it’s far too lazy to criticise without digging a bit deeper.</p>
      <p>Yesterday was MacPhee’s 57th game involved with Northern Ireland, stretching back five years.</p>
      <p>He is a trusted member of O’Neill’s backroom staff.</p>
      <p>That kind of experience is to die for if you are trying to make a pitch for the Hearts job.</p>
      <p>To have someone of O’Neill’s calibre having your back also speaks volumes for what he must bring to the table.</p>
      <p>But he said: “I don’t think he would be given a fair chance as head coach given the water that’s gone under the bridge.”</p>
      <p>A guilt by association after being assistant to the Hearts horror show of Ian Cathro’s tenure as well as working alongside the similarly traumatic reign of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a>, should already have ruled him out of the job.</p>

      <p>So there he was last week, Hearts scoring five goals for the first time in three-and-a-half-years to make it three wins in four matches as interim manager.</p>
      <p>But it won’t be enough.</p>
      <p>Jambos owner Ann Budge will have to decide what to do with MacPhee over the next few days, but thankfully she’s had Donald Park by her side during the interview process for the manager’s post.</p>
      <p>One of the game’s most respected coaches, a brilliant guy and someone who will know the club needs to recruit a manager who’s more earthy, as it’s time to get back to basics and ditch a new-age approach which has had too many cooks.</p>
      <p>Parky met with Stuart McCall this week. Hearts fans may not be bowled over by the appoint-ment of a man who was shown the door most recently at Scunthorpe – but he should be the perfect choice.</p>
      <p>The need to bring back some blood and thunder to Tynecastle is clear and who better than McCall and Kenny Black?</p>
      <p>Daniel Stendel is another standout candidate.</p>
      <p>The German is out of work after being sacked by Barnsley following a run of 10 games without a result, but after leading the Tykes to promotion from League One by implementing an attacking, high-tempo style, his stock remains high.</p>
      <p>Hearts don’t need to complicate matters any more than they have – just get either man in posthaste.</p>
