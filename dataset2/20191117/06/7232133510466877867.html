      <h3>Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis</h3>
      <p>This past week, Ethereum retested the key $190 resistance area against the US Dollar. However, ETH price failed to continue higher, resulting in a fresh decline below the $188 support area.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break below the key $186 support area. Finally, there was a close below the $184 support and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). The bears gained pace below the $180 level and a low was formed near the $177 level.</p>
      <p>It seems like the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/ethereum-eth-trading-near-last-line-of-defense/">$176-$178 support area is playing a crucial role</a> for the bulls. Recently, there was an upside correction above the $180 level. Furthermore, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $190 swing high to $177 low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, Ethereum price seems to be facing a strong resistance near the $184 level and the 100 SMA. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $190 swing high to $177 low is also near the $184 level.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $186 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD. Therefore, the price is likely to face a strong resistance, starting with $184 and up to $186.</p>
      <p>Having said that, the price must settle above the $188 and $190 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. The next key resistances are near the $200 and $205 levels.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are many key supports near the $178 and $176 levels. If there is a daily close below the $176 support, the price could decline heavily. The next major support are near the $165 and $160 levels.</p>
