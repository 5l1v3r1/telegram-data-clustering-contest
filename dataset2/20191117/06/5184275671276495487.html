      <p>Ranu Mondal’s story is an inspiration to many. It is a classic example of rags to riches where a lady who used to sing at the stations, got a chance to record songs with one of the celebrated composers in Bollywood – Himesh Reshammiya. With the growing popularity, Ranu’s attitude about things has also changed quite drastically with the growing popularity and one such example has left the internet in splits.</p>
      <p>The singing sensation, who was always seen in a sari, decided to get a makeover this time as she headed out to attend an event. Ditching her usual look, Ranu wore a glamorous lehenga and was even wearing makeup. The highlight was that her makeup was a couple of tones lighter than her natural skin colour.</p>

      <p>Ever since her talent’s discovery, Ranu Mondal has been in the limelight for something or the other. Recently, she came in the news for misbehaving with a fan who asked for a selfie. The netizens were quite upset with her behaviour and backlashed the sensational singer with harsh comments. Himesh Reshammiya had to intervene and defend Ranu for what she did.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Himesh just released the first song from his film <i>Happy Hardy and Heer</i> titled Aashiqui Mein Teri 2.0 which is sung by Ranu and him.</p>
