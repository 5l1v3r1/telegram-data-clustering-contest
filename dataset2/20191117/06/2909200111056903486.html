      <p>National Democratic Congress (NDC) activist, Dela Coffie has accused Member of Parliament (MP) for North Tongu Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa of deliberately deceiving people that the Volta Region has been left out of government’s policy programs in the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>“Folks like Okudzeto Ablakwa who should know better are out there behaving badly, and parroting the ‘great deception’ about ‘VOLTA REGION’ being omitted from the government’s policy programs for the coming year,” he alleged on social media in a post MyNewsGh.com sighted.</p>
      <p>Honourable Okudzeto Ablakwa had accused the government of intentionally sidelining the Volta Region with respect to plans to construct some “critical roads” across the country.</p>
      <p>But the unrelenting critic of his own party members have argued that the MP was being deliberately misleading with his views on the construction of roads in the Volta Region, adding that he was merely doing so to score cheap political points.</p>
      <p>“A quick check from the budget document reveals that quite a number of Volta roads projects were mentioned in paragraph 867. In fact there was a mention of the construction of Dufor Adidome – Asikuma road project, and table 21 list the other projects including dualisation of Ho main roads and the construction of Ho main bypass. It is therefore very misleading and disingenuous for a member of parliament to lead such graceless enterprise in an attempt to score cheap political points,” he chastised.</p>
      <p>He then took the NDC on for not constructing the roads it had promised the Volta Region while it was in power even though the region is traditionally a stronghold of the NDC.</p>
      <p>“In any event, why didn’t the NDC complete all the volta roads projects that was mentioned in the budget statements of 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016?</p>
      <p>What prevented the NDC government from completing the Eastern Corridor Road? The Sokode-Ho road? Denu-Havedzi Road? Mafi-Kpedzeglo to Juapong Road? And many other promised roads projects in Volta region?” He wondered.</p>
