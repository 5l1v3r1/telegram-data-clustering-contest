        <b>For the Bourbon caramel sauce</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>75g sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp single cream</li>
        <li>25ml Bourbon whiskey</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>For the topping, whisk the milk and cream together with the custard powder, cocoa powder and sugar in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to the boil and simmer, stirring continuously, until it thickens. Transfer the custard to a bowl, cover immediately with plastic wrap and leave to cool completely. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180C/170C fan/Gas 5 and line a baking tray with baking paper. Finely grind half of the walnuts in a high-powered blender or grinder. Chop the remaining nuts. Dissolve 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the hot water and toss with the chopped nuts. Transfer the mixture to the baking tray in a single layer and roast for about 10 minutes, turning once. Leave to cool. Don’t turn off the oven.</li>
        <li>Beat the butter until creamy. Whisk in the remaining sugar and vanilla sugar. Whisk the eggs in one by one. Combine the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and ground walnuts. Combine the milk and Bourbon in a separate bowl. Stir the Bourbon mixture and the dry ingredients into the egg mixture, alternating between the two. Do not overmix. Fold in the caramelised, roasted walnuts.</li>
        <li>Line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases. Divide the batter among the holes, filling them three-quarters full. Bake for 18–20 minutes. A skewer or toothpick inserted into the centre should come out clean. Set aside to cool a little before removing from the tin. Leave the muffins to cool completely.</li>
        <li>For the topping, whip the butter until light and creamy. Stir the cold, firm custard until smooth. Slowly add the custard to the butter, one tablespoon at a time, to make a pipeable cream. Transfer the cream</li>
        <li>to a piping bag and pipe on top of the cooled muffins.</li>
        <li>For the Bourbon caramel sauce, caramelise the sugar in a small saucepan until light brown, stirring continuously. Whisk in the cream and simmer briefly until well combined and glossy. Remove from the</li>
        <li>heat and stir in the Bourbon. Set aside to cool, then use a teaspoon to drizzle the sauce over the muffins. Serve these cupcakes immediately.</li>
