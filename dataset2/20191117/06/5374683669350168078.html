      <p>Iran's Deputy Defense Minister Qassem Taqizadeh claimed on Saturday that the ministry has started manufacturing air defense laser cannons.</p>
      <p>Taqizadeh said, according to the <i>Xinhua</i> news agency, that Iran has obtained the technical know-how to manufacture laser air defense cannons for bringing down hostile quadcopters and small aircraft.</p>
      <p>The military hardware has passed laboratory tests and is manufactured in the country, he added.</p>
      <p>He further boasted that Iran has improved the range and precision of ground-launched cruise missiles with a new digital mapping system, whose testing stages will be over in the near future.</p>
      <p>Efforts are underway to manufacture ground-to-ground ballistic missiles with pinpoint accuracy, claimed Taqizadeh, adding that Iran is now among the world's "top five powers in the missile industry."</p>
      <p>Iran often boasts of its military accomplishments, though it is not always possible to say with certainty that it is telling the truth about those accomplishment</p>
      <p>In 2017, the Islamic Republic <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/226579">claimed to have unveiled</a> a domestically manufactured tank which “has the capability to fire missiles and precisely guide them."</p>
      <p>Previously, Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/226475">it had successfully tested</a> a Hormuz 2-type ballistic missile.</p>
      <p>Iran has also claimed <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/235648">it is in possession</a> of the “father of all bombs”, described as a domestically-made 10-ton bomb with a high destructive power.</p>
      <p>Last month, a senior Iranian military official <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270841">announced the production</a> of a new model of drones intended to be used by the offensive infantry, rapid intervention units and intelligence units.</p>
