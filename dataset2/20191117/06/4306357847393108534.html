      <h3>Pat Nevin says Chelsea FC teenager Reece James is an exceptional talent, adding that the full-back reminds him of Branislav Ivanovic.</h3>
      <p>The 19-year-old earned plenty of plaudits for his performance in Chelsea FC’s 2-0 win against Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge last weekend.</p>
      <p>James acquitted himself well against one of the Premier League’s best wingers, Wilfried Zaha, in a gung-ho battle between the pair.</p>
      <p>The England Under-21 international scored his first Champions League goal earlier this month when he netted the equaliser in a 4-4 draw with Ajax.</p>
      <p>James has netted two goals in nine games in all competitions in his fledgling Chelsea FC career so far.</p>
      <p>Former Blues winger Nevin is excited about the English full-back’s potential.</p>
      <p>“He is definitely [a serious prospect]. Branislav Ivanovic was the same player. That’s a big compliment. He’s exceptional for his age,” Nevin told the <i>Off The Ball</i> podcast on Irish radio station <i>Newstalk</i>.</p>
      <p>The Blues star has made one start and three substitute appearances in the Premier League season so far.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea FC youth graduate has scored one goal in three Champions League fixtures this term.</p>
      <p>James has been at Chelsea FC since the age of six, when he joined the west London outfit’s academy back in 2006.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea FC number 24 was part of Blues teams that won the FA Youth Cup in 2017 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The Blues are in third position in the Premier League table following a run of seven successive victories.</p>
