      <p><b>What’s for breakfast?</b> There’s nothing better than cornflakes with hot milk. It’s my Sunday treat. They taste so much better when the cornflakes have gone all squidgy. The hot milk relaxes me, so I normally have a little snooze after.</p>
      <p><b>What were Sundays like growing up? </b>They were lovely. We’d get up. My dad would clean the car. No one would rush around. And we’d always have a family roast around 3pm.</p>
      <p><b>Secret to the perfect roast potato?</b> Plump them up a bit, lots of rock salt, hot, hot fat, lots of love and in they go. That’s how you do them GC-style, honey.</p>
      <p><b>Sunday treat?</b> It’s got to be a hot pudding with custard. Treacle sponge, bit of jam roly-poly. I think it’s acceptable to eat custard on Sundays.</p>
      <p><b>Love or dread Monday mornings?</b> What do sharks do on Monday mornings? They get up and start biting. That’s me.</p>
      <p><b>Best way to change a duvet cover?</b> I have to be honest, I have people who do that for me. I think you have to button it inwards, not outwards? I can’t remember. I have a team of cleaners, in case one is off sick or goes on holiday. I probably haven’t made my own bed for the past 10 years, honey.</p>
      <p><b>Sunday TV?</b> I always put on the same film. I watch <i>Planet of the Apes </i>back to back. The new trilogy. I’m obsessed. I must have watched them more than 100 times. That’s all I ever watch on a Sunday. If they made a sequel, I’d love to play an ape.</p>
      <p><b>Should every day be like Sunday?</b> In a dream world, too right. But we can’t live in a dream world. We’ve all got bills to pay, you know what I mean?</p>
