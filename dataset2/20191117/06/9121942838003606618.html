      <p>EL-ARISH, Egypt (AP) — Egyptian officials say a roadside bomb has killed at least three members of the security forces in the restive northern Sinai province.</p>
      <p>The explosion hit their armored vehicle Sunday in the town of Sheikh Zuweid. Four other security force members were wounded, including an officer.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to reporters.</p>
      <p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>Egypt has for years been battling an insurgency in the northern Sinai Peninsula that’s now led by an Islamic State group affiliate.</p>
      <p>The fighting intensified in 2013 after the military overthrew the country’s elected but divisive Islamist president.</p>
      <p>Authorities heavily restrict access to northern Sinai, making it difficult to verify claims related to the fighting.</p>
