      <h1>An IMF ‘bailout’ does not mean an economy is in a mess – Sammy Gyamfi</h1>

      <p>Sammy Gyamfi, National Communications Officer of the National Democratic Congress( NDC) has debunked claims the Mahama administration handed over a messed up economy to President Akufo-Addo  in 2016, rejecting the argument that an economy on an International Monetary Fund( IMF) programme is an economy in a mess.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the 2020 budget on Metro TV’s Good Morning Ghana last week monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a>, Mr  Gyamfi refuted the assertion that the National Democratic Congress ( NDC) government led by President John Mahama handed over an economy in dire straits to the current administration.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwaku Baako, was a co-panelist, on the show had reiterated the argument that the NPP inherited that was not in good health: “The economy that was inherited by the Akufo-Addo administration was clearly not an economy in good health…that was an economy that was actually on an IMF bailout programme,” he had claimed.</p>
      <p>But Mr Gyamfi rejected the argument, reminding Mr Baako that even during President Kufuor’s time, the economy was put on an IMF bailout programme.</p>
      <p>“The fact that we were on an IMF programme is no proof or is no basis to say that the economy was in total mess. We went to the IMF under Kufuor. Will Mr Baako agree with anyone that for that matter the economy was in a total mess under President Kufuor? Every IMF programme has an objective. And so you need to analyse that within that context,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Mr Gyamfi then went on to mention a litany of things that the Mahama administration handed over to the Akufo-Addo administration as proof that the economy was not in a mess.</p>
      <p>“And an Economy which was in a mess could not have 6.3 million dollars as reserves; couldn’t have given you almost one billion metric tonnes of cocoa that year; couldn’t have given you three oilfields with three FPSOs and a total oil production of 180,000 barrels per day; it couldn’t have given you an Atuabo Gas Infrastructure which now saves the country 300 million dollars and over, sinking fund of 800 million dollars…and so the economy they inherited in 2016 was not in a mess,” he declared.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday November 13, 2019, the Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta presented the 2020 budget and economic policy statement to Parliament, promising chiefly that 2020 will be the year of roads.</p>
