      <p>Russia has earned more money this year from the OPEC+ deal than Saudi Arabia, underscoring how the Kingdom has carried a greater share of the burden of production cuts.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia on average has cut production almost ten times deeper than Russia, according to estimates in the International Energy Agency’s monthly oil market report. <br/><br/>Yet Riyadh has received just three quarters of the additional financial benefit enjoyed by Moscow, the data show.<br/><br/>Russia has earned an average of $670 million a day in gross crude oil revenues in 2019. That’s $170 million a day more than in the last quarter of 2016, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners reached the first production-cuts deal, the IEA said, according to Bloomberg.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia has been earning $630 million every day since the start of the year, up $125 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, Bloomberg quoted the IEA as saying.<br/><br/>While the Kingdom has reduced its oil production since the end of 2016, by around 740,000 barrels a day, Russia’s daily output cuts have averaged just 75,000 barrels, according to the Paris-based agency.</p>
