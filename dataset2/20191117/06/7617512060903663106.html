Playing with the best musicians — like Jordie — that I can. More than anything, I love the feeling of getting in the van and going. Even better, once I get there, I love the feeling of knockin’ ’em dead.”</p>

      <h3>Save-on-Foods raising funds for pediatric ICU</h3>
      <p>Save-on-Foods stores in Greater Victoria have just launched a three-week campaign with a goal of raising $25,000 towards the purchase of a patient monitor for the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Victoria General Hospital.</p>
      <p>Between now and Dec. 4, customers at eight stores can take part in the fundraising campaign. Many small donations made at the till (with a purchase) can quickly add up to make a major impact in our community.</p>
      <p>The patient monitor provides pediatric caregivers with critically important information so that they can take immediate and informed action.</p>
      <p>“With 250 children in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit every year, the need to support our tiniest patients is critical. Our community knows this. Over the last five years, our donors have impactfully and generously funded 80 per cent of equipment in the PICU,” said Avery Brohman, acting executive director of the Victoria Hospitals Foundation.</p>
      <p>“To now have our local Save-on-Foods stores and their generous customers join this important cause means our caregivers can have access to leading-edge equipment, and our littlest patients can continue to receive the very best care, right here at home. We are deeply thankful.”</p>
      <p>Participating stores include Blanshard Street, Fort Street, Pandora Avenue, Sidney, Tillicum, University Heights, Vic West and Westshore.</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 pediatric patients are cared for every year at Victoria General Hospital, with one in eight children requiring care in the PICU.</p>
