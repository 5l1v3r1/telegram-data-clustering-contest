      <h1>This is officially the best place to go for a Christmas break</h1>
      <h2>Riga has retained its crown as the best value city for UK travellers embarking on a European Christmas market break.</h2>

      <p>The Latvian capital was found to be the lowest priced out of 13 destinations included in an annual report by Post Office Travel Money.</p>
      <p>The research took into account the cost for two people of a flight or Eurostar ticket, bed and breakfast accommodation, airport transfers, two evening meals with wine, coffee, festive drinks and snacks at a Christmas market.</p>
      <p>A good choice of low-cost hotel accommodation and flights saw Riga come out on top for the third year running.</p>
      <p>The total price for the basket of goods analysed was 36% lower than in Vienna, the most expensive city.</p>
      <p>Lille offers the best value in Western Europe due to a 17% year-on-year price fall.</p>
      <p>Nick Boden, of Post Office Travel Money, said: "Our research found that Prague was one of only three cities where package prices have risen.</p>
      <p>"Big falls of over 25% in many other cities suggest there is more flight and hotel availability this year, resulting in strong competition for business and lower prices.</p>
      <p>"This makes it a great time for holidaymakers to plan bargain Christmas markets trips."</p>
