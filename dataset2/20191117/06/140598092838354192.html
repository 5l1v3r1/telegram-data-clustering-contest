      <p>This pie-of-sorts looks similar to a cheesecake when plated up; it's so delicious that it certainly won't last long on the table. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b><b>30</b> minutes, plus chilling | <b>Cooking time: </b>25 minutes </p>
      <h3>MAKES</h3>
      <p>one 24cm pie</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Butter, for greasing</li>
        <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Amaretto</li>
        <li>140g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the filling</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>8 gelatine sheets</li>
        <li>500g plain yogurt</li>
        <li>150g crème fraîche</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <li>Seeds of 1 vanilla bean</li>
        <li>Grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>250ml single cream</li>
        <li>85g cherry jam</li>
        <li>300g bottled morello cherries, drained</li>
        <li>30g amaretti biscuits, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/170C fan/Gas 5. Line the base of a 24cm springform tin with baking paper. Lightly butter the side of the tin.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg whites and salt until stiff. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar until foamy and stir in the Amaretto. Do not overmix. Combine the flour and baking powder and gently stir into the egg yolk mixture along with a third of the beaten egg whites. Carefully fold in the remaining egg whites.</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to the tin and level the top. Bake until golden brown, about 18-20 minutes. Leave to cool briefly, then remove from the tin and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Transfer the sponge base to a serving plate and place a cake ring around it.</li>
        <li>For the filling, briefly soak the gelatine in cold water. Whisk the yogurt and crème fraîche with the sugar, vanilla seeds and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Gently squeeze a little water from the gelatine. Transfer to a small saucepan and dissolve over low heat, stirring continuously. Be careful not to overheat the gelatine. Stir 2-3 tbsp of the yogurt mixture into the gelatine, then add the gelatine mixture to the remaining yoghurt mixture and stir to combine. Refrigerate the filling for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream into the yoghurt mixture as soon as it starts to set.</li>
        <li>Spread 1½ tbsp of the cherry jam on top of the sponge. Top with the yogurt cream and level the top. Refrigerate the pie for about 20 minutes. Combine the remaining cherry jam with the cherries and spread the mixture over the top of the pie. Refrigerate again for at least 2½ hours.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide a thin knife around the inside of the cake ring and remove the ring. Put the amaretti biscuits into a resealable plastic bag and coarsely crush with a rolling pin. Sprinkle the crushed biscuits over the pie just before serving.</li>
      </ol>
