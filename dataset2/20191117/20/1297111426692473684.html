      <h2>The works of Christi Belcourt, Isaac Murdoch, Rajni Perera and Nep Sidhu now hang in the MacKenzie Art Gallery, challenging viewers to think about the issues going on around them.</h2>

      <p>While the artwork hanging in two new exhibitions at the MacKenzie Art Gallery may look very different from one another, they both showcase how art can be a catalyst for social change.</p>
      <p>Rajni Perera moved from Sri Lanka to Canada at the age of nine with her family. Attending a European-centric art school in Canada years later, she felt there was little room for the stories of an immigrant in the art world.</p>
      <p>She decided to change this and, by combining art with her childhood passion for science fiction, she found her voice as an artist and as an immigrant woman.</p>
      <p>Nep Sidhu, who is originally from Punjab, India, saw a need to redefine what people saw as normal. While he said his work has been called “controversial” and even “dangerous,” he does not view it that way.</p>
      <p>“It’s simply a realignment of what’s natural,” he said.</p>
      <p>As a Metis woman, Christi Belcourt saw widespread disrespect for Mother Earth and the growing challenge of climate change. Through her paintings, she seeks to combine her roles as artist and advocate for the land to show the need to respect Mother Earth.</p>
      <p>Works from all three of these artists are now on display at the MacKenzie Art Gallery in two new exhibitions. Perera and Sidhu’s works form the Banners for New Empires exhibition, which explores how humanity can move into the future without forgetting the past, combining history with technology and science fiction.</p>
      <p>More than 30 of Belcourt’s paintings — together with works from fellow artist Isaac Murdoch that have become synonymous with the resistance against resource extraction — create Uprising: The Power of Mother Earth. This exhibition focuses on the connectedness of nature and humanity, and the need to respect Mother Earth.</p>

      <p>At the opening of the two exhibitions Saturday morning, Belcourt, Perera and Sidhu all gathered at the MacKenzie for a panel discussion on their artwork and the role it plays in creating social change.</p>
      <p>Belcourt pointed to the disrespect of Mother Earth, climate change and how passive people seem to have become to the issues going on around them.</p>
      <p>“We are living in a time of great uncertainty and ecological collapses and climate change. We are living in a time when there exists green technology, but there does not exist the will to move us forward in that direction,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Where is our line in the sand that we say we will not allow that to happen?”</p>
      <p>Perera found it fitting that her cellphone went off in the middle of the discussion, and said rapid technological development is not putting humanity ahead in every way.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that can show you the world and what’s going on and it also hypnotizes you out of taking action,” she said, adding that in the race to continue developing new technology, many of the resources being used are not sustainably resourced.</p>
      <p>“There’s a blindness to our progress that in my work I really want to address by showing its effects.”</p>
      <p>Uprising: The Power of Mother Earth will be at the MacKenzie until March 2020 and Banners for New Empires will be on display until February 2020.</p>
