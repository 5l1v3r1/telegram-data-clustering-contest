      <h1>Gareth Southgate: England are in better shape than before the World Cup after securing top-seed status for Euros</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:57:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/matt-law/" target="_blank">Matt Law</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has claimed that England are currently in better shape than they were before the World Cup in Russia after securing top-seed status for next summer’s European Championships.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/kosovo-vs-england-euro-2020-qualifiers-live-score-latest-updates/">England beat Kosovo 4-0 </a>in their final Euro 2020 qualifying game to finish top of Group A and enter the November finals draw in pot one.</p>
      <p>Goals from Harry Winks, Harry Kane, Marcus Rasford and Mason Mount took England’s final tally for qualifying to an incredible 37 in their eight games.</p>
      <p>England reached the semi-finals in Russia last summer, but Southgate believes his squad are better equipped ahead of the next major tournament in which Southgate’s team are guaranteed to play at Wembley at least three times.</p>
      <p>“I would say that we’re definitely further ahead than we were heading into Russia, but we made massive strides in this period when we went into Russia,” said England manager Southgate.</p>
      <p>“So, we’ve got to make sure that to get the level of performance next summer, we’re going to have to improve in the way that we did over that spell as well. And I think the team have belief, for sure, you can see the confidence.</p>
      <p>“They don’t come into these matches worrying about what might go wrong, they’ve got the confidence to control games with possession and they know they’re going to score goals.”</p>
      <p>On the significance of being top seeds in the draw, Southgate added: “Well, the reality is we don’t know how important it is. But, for sure, if we’d finished second and got a stinker of a draw, then we’d be getting pelters.</p>
      <p>“So it’s better to win the group and control as much of our destiny as we can, and we wanted to keep winning football matches. Let’s see. I think the good thing is that whoever comes to play us knows they’re in for a tough game.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to have some confidence about what we’re doing as well. That said, we’ve got a lot to keep improving on, and we know that. So none of us are complacent in any way, we keep pushing the players for the fine details of the game all the time, and they want that, they’re hungry for that, which is a really good sign for us.”</p>
      <p>Despite seeing plenty of encouraging signs and looking forward to some home advantage, Southgate has also warned his players that the European Championship will be just as difficult as the World Cup to try to win.</p>
      <p>“What we don’t know, because we haven’t had those tests more recently against the top eight or 10, is exactly how we’re going to cope in those moments,” said Southgate. “And to win the European Championship is, at the moment, no easier than the World Cup. The final four were all European, and you’ve got to add Spain, Germany, Portugal and all the others into that, so it’s a really high-level tournament.”</p>

      <p>England were not always convincing against Kosovo, but there were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/17/kosovo-vs-england-player-ratings-dazzled-disappointed-4-0-victory/">plenty of positives for Southgate</a> to reflect on. Winks and Mount scored their first international goals, Kane maintained his incredible record, goalkeeper Nick Pope kept a clean sheet on his first start and Fikayo Tomori’s international future is now tied down after he made a late appearance as a substitute.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling also assisted two goals on his return from his one-game ban for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/england-teammates-raheem-sterling-joe-gomez-came-blows-steps/">attacking Joe Gomez</a> and Southgate said: “Look, I think our forward players, I mean, Raheem [Sterling], Harry [Kane], Marcus [Rashford] are so exciting to work with. Then, with the younger ones that are supporting that.</p>
      <p>“So it’s clearly an area of the team that they thrive from each other, they create for each other, they are all scoring goals - which wasn’t the case 18 months ago, particularly for Marcus and Raheem, in the numbers that they’ve been getting.</p>
      <p>“But they work so hard for the team. That’s, for me, the biggest thing. Nobody in our squad can ever shirk the hard work because when your forward three create the way they do, score the way they do, but press and work for the team the way they do, it’s brilliant for the culture of how we want, and how we need to play.”</p>

      <p>Winks has now started three successive games in England’s midfield, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has started twice, scoring against Montenegro and assisting for Winks against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>“In the last two matches we played, Harry (Winks) had provided that connection that we know he can,” said Southgate. “We wanted to see him in a different role that gave us a double pivot at times and he was under more pressure in the receiving than in those previous two games, where we were kind of able to walk the ball to halfway really.</p>
      <p>“So I think his value in that was good, but also his mentality to work for the team. A couple of times he had to cover counter-attacks. Obviously great that he got forward for his goal as well, so a really positive evening for him.”</p>
