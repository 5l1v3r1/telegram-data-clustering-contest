      <p>The income tax department has detected alleged undisclosed income of ₹435 crore after it raided a Tamil Nadu-based company, the CBDT said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Unaccounted cash of ₹32.6 crore and about 10 kgs of gold jewellery has been seized during the search operations that were launched on November 15 at twenty premises in “a tier 3 city of Tamil Nadu”, it said without disclosing the exact locations.</p>
      <p>“The company is in the business of manufacturing certain specialised materials which are supplied to the health sector in India and abroad,” the CBDT said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Central Board of Direct Taxes is the policy-making body for the I-T department</p>
      <p>It said the company, which was not identified, was “indulging in substantial tax evasion”.</p>
      <p>“The major finding of the search action is that the company has systematically inflated its expenditure using bogus or fabricated invoices.</p>
      <p>“By booking such non-existent expenditure in its books of account, the company and its promoters have suppressed the true income of the company over the years,” it said.</p>
      <p>It wars found, the CBDT said, that the company would pay for such bogus expenses by cheque or RTGS and then receive the cash back.</p>
      <p>“The unaccounted income so generated has been deployed by the company’s promote₹ into investments in immovable properties by making unaccounted payments, further investments in the business itself as share capital and in fixed bank deposits, cash and other valuables,” it said.</p>
      <p>The undisclosed income of the company and its promoters is estimated at about ₹435 crore, it said.</p>
      <p>Further enquiries are in progress, the statement said.</p>
