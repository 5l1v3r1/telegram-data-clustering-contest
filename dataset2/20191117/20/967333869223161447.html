        <b>MURMANSK (Sputnik) - Convicted Norwegian spy Frode Berg, who was released from Russia into Lithuania earlier this week, arrived at Oslo airport in the early hours of Sunday, Norvegian tabloid VG reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A private jet delivered Berg from Vilnius to Oslo, where he was met by his wife and daughter, the newspaper said. He was taken to an undisclosed location then.</p>
      <p>Berg was freed from a jail in Russia, where he was sentenced to 14 years for spying, and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911161077319835-freed-norwegian-spy-frode-berg-to-go-home-as-soon-as-possible--prime-minister/">handed over</a> to the Norwegian Embassy in Vilnius in a spy swap that also involved two Lithuanians and two Russians.</p>
      <p>Berg, a retired Norwegian border agent, was detained in Moscow in late 2017 upon receiving documents that contained classified information concerning the Russian Navy. Last April, a Russian court sentenced him to 14 years in a high-security prison on espionage charges.</p>
      <p>Berg denied the charges, while his defence lawyer said that he might have been used as a carrier for the classified documents by intelligence officers without being aware of it.</p>
