      <h1>Prorogation barrister heads push against ‘exit-fee’ contracts</h1>
      <h2>Bid to protect graduate trainees against harsh financial penalties for leaving jobs early</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:15:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Wright</a></address>
      <p>One of the campaign groups that brought a successful legal challenge against parliament’s suspension by Boris Johnson has thrown its weight behind efforts to protect graduate trainees against demands by employers to make payments worth thousands of pounds if they leave their jobs early.</p>
      <p>The Good Law Project is supporting employment tribunal cases starting on Monday and brought by Michael Bennett and Charles Day, who claim their former employer Geeks, a London software company, wrongly charged them exit fees for quitting their jobs.</p>
      <p>Jolyon Maugham, head of the project, believes Mr Bennett and Mr Day are examples of thousands of modestly paid recent graduates at risk of facing demands by employers for thousands of pounds to cover training costs after leaving their jobs early.</p>
      <p>The project plans to challenge in court the now widespread use by companies of contracts that they say trap graduate trainees financially.</p>
      <p>It hopes to establish the legal status of the exit fee contracts, which require that graduates pay back the costs of their training to employers if they leave before a set period, usually about two years.</p>
      <p>The contracts generally put the expense at about £20,000, many times what most graduate trainees believe the training actually costs.</p>
      <p>Mr Maugham said he believed the exit-fee contracts placed a higher-than-permitted burden on employees but there was uncertainty because the principles had never been fully tested in court.</p>
      <p>“We believe that these clauses are clearly unlawful but I can’t say that I’m absolutely certain that that’s so,” said Mr Maugham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/21cabef2-39f2-11e9-b856-5404d3811663">Tanya de Grunwald</a>, founder of <a href="https://graduatefog.co.uk/">Graduate Fog</a>, a graduate careers advice blog, said exit fee contracts had overtaken unpaid internships as the biggest source of complaints she received.</p>
      <p>“The tenor of the messages is more desperate and, frankly, more disturbing,” she added, comparing exit fee complaints with those on internships.</p>
      <p>In a submission to the south London employment tribunal, Mr Bennett wrote that Geeks told him at the end of a six-month probation period that he owed them £15,800 for his training.</p>
      <p>They said the sum would be reduced month-by-month over the two further years he was obliged to work for them.</p>

      <p>He is asking the tribunal to order Geeks to hand over about £2,000 of wages that the company withheld in partial repayment of the £3,630 it said it was still owed when he left.</p>
      <p>He is also asking the tribunal to prevent Geeks from demanding the remaining balance.</p>
      <p>Mr Day is seeking recovery of £3,485 in pay that Geeks withheld from him.</p>
      <p>Mr Day’s case could be decided on Monday. Mr Bennett’s case is set to be adjourned on Monday for a later hearing.</p>
      <p>Geeks and Paymon Khamooshi, its chief executive, did not answer emails about the cases.</p>
      <p>However, in a written submission to the tribunal Mr Khamooshi insisted Mr Bennett signed his contract voluntarily and had received the expected standard of training.</p>
      <p>He also argued that the contract’s legality had been established in the case of another Geeks trainee who lost a county court case seeking to recover withheld wages.</p>
      <p>Mr Maugham said he believed FDM Group, based in Birmingham, had about 3,000 people on exit-fee contracts.</p>
      <p>Like many of the companies using the contracts, FDM is an IT contractor and hires the trainees out to its clients.</p>
      <p>FDM said it provided “high quality, classroom-based training”.</p>
