      <h1>Colts Announce Injury Update For RB Marlon Mack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:08:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Marlon Mack was dominating through two-plus quarters against the Jacksonville Jaguars this afternoon. The Indianapolis Colts running back was arguably the best player on the field, rushing for more than 100 yards and a touchdown heading into the end of the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The Coltsâ€™ running back has since left the game with a hand injury. The updates from Indianapolis are not good.</p>
      <p>Mack has been ruled out of the rest of the game with a hand injury.</p>
      <p>This is a significant loss for the Colts.</p>

      <p>NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport hints that the hand injury might be a significant one for Mack, who has been having a great season.</p>

      <p>Any kind of serious injury would be a huge blow to a Colts team making a push at the playoffs. Mack is on pace for more than 1,000 yards this season following a breakout campaign in 2018.</p>
      <p>Indianapolis is currently leading Jacksonville, 17-7. The Colts could have a new update on Mack following the game.</p>
