      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Saturday’s Ohio State-Penn State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:48:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The biggest game on college football’s Week 13 slate is taking place in Columbus. The undefeated Ohio State Buckeyes will be hosting Penn State in what is essentially a play-in game for the Big Ten Championship.</p>
      <p>Ohio State enters the game as a massive favorite. The Buckeyes are listed as a 19-point favorite by the sportsbooks. That’s a massive spread for a game between two top 10 teams.</p>
      <p>ESPN doesn’t seem to think the game will be close, either.</p>
      <p>The Football Power Index is extremely confident in Ryan Day’s team.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index is giving Ohio State an 84.3 percent chance of winning this game, giving Penn State just a 15.7 percent chance of pulling off the upset.</h3>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State will kick off at noon E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
