      <h1>Redskins Fan Chant “Sell The Team” During Blowout Against The Jets (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The Washington Redskins are such a bad franchise to the point the product on the field can’t even score a touchdown anymore.</p>
      <p>The equally bad New York Jets came into town to face them and it was never a contest as the Jets would take a commanding 34-11 lead in the 4th quarter.</p>
      <p>After that, the fan base began to chant “sell the team” which was directed to owner Dan Snyder who has been a terrible owner since purchasing the franchise.</p>
