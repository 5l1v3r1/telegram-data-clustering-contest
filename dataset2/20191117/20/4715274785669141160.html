      <p>Biking newbies and enthusiasts get another chance to ride side-by-side with three-time Tour de France green jersey winner Robbie McEwen and local celebrities in the Sun Life Cycle PH slated Nov. 23 the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig yesterday.</p>
      <p>Over a thousand participants are taking part in a weekend of fun, wellness activity and family bonding through cycling with the event featuring the tricycle ride (100-m distance for two- to three years olds), kids’ ride (500-m for 4-5 years old) and the family ride (30-minute ride for 6-15 with adult companion).</p>
      <p>Other categories on tap are the solo ride (30-minute ride for 6-15), short distance ride (20-km for 10 and above) and long distance ride (40-km for 10 and above) where riders will pedal alongside McEwen and Star Magic artists, led by Piolo Pascual.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the event will be launched in a press conference on Friday (Nov. 22) at 4 p.m. at the SEDA BGC Hotel.</p>
      <p>McEwen, an Australian cycling legend and Olympiad veteran, has cited the big improvement on the local cycling scene as he rode alongside former junior national cycling team members and celebrities in last year’s inaugurals of the event organized by Sunrise Events, Inc., now part of the IRONMAN Group.</p>
      <p>“Looking at them at times riding along at 40-km an hour and they look completely comfortable, it’s obvious to me that the level of Filipino riders over the last four years has really improved. I can see them more at ease with the bike and riding faster, looking stronger,” said McEwen, now in his sixth visit in the country.</p>
      <p>SunPiology founder Pascual is also thrilled over the huge turnout in the second edition also held to further promote awareness on keeping a healthy lifestyle, diabetes prevention and helping less-privileged kids sustain their education, the event also being staged as a fund-raiser.</p>
