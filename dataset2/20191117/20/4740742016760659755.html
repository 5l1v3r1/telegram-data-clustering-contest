      <h1>Katie Hopkins forced to sell £1m home and now rents after losing libel case</h1>
      <h2>Jack Monroe, food writer, journalist and activist, took Hopkins to court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:22:57+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Katie Hopkins was forced to sell off her £1million Devon home (pictured below) and now rents after losing a humiliating court case.</p>
      <p>The former Apprentice contestant, whose extreme views saw her sacked from two lucrative newspaper columns and her LBC radio show, has moved into rented accommodation so she can pay off a £500,000 legal bill after writer Jack Monroe sued her for libel and won, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-forced-sell-1m-20899416">The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sunday Times, Hopkins said that speaking her mind lost her her career - having compared migrants crossing the Mediterranean in dinghies to "cockroaches" and claiming she'd use gunships to prevent people from landing on European shores.</p>

      <p>"I live in a rented, modern, four-bedroom detached house with my husband Mark and our three children, aged 15, 14 and 10," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's tucked out of the way for security reasons - our last home was rigged up to the local police station and had panic alarms fitted because of threats I received to my life.</p>
      <p>"I was forced to sell it for £950,000 in early 2018 to pay off a legal bill in excess of £500,000."</p>

      <p>After falsely accusing anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe of vandalising a war memorial Hopkins refused to settle out of court and instead fought the writer through the courts - this decision cost Katie her family home.</p>

      <p>Asked what her worst business decision had been, she said: "Arguably, not settling the legal case brought against me.</p>
      <p>"I could have settled by giving £5,000 to a migrant charity but chose not to, and the ensuing court action and legal bills forced me to apply for an individual voluntary arrangement ."</p>
      <p>In September, Hopkins came under fire once again when Little Mix's Jesy Nelson cited her fat-shaming tweet as the point at which her depression spiralled out of control, leading to a suicide attempt.</p>

      <p>In the BBC documentary Odd One Out, Jesy recalled how she came off stage after an <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/x-factor-tv-start-date-269629?service=responsive">X Factor</a> performance in 2013 to read a tweet from Hopkins that read: "Packet Mix have still got a chubber in their ranks. Less Little Mix. More Pick n Mix."</p>
      <p>Jesy revealed she'd not eaten for a week before her X Factor return in 2013 and was horrified when she saw what Hopkins said after the performance.</p>
      <p>The Little Mix star said: "All I remember feeling at that time is what’s the f***ing point.</p>
      <p>"I've starved myself for a week and I'm still getting called fat. I could be the skinniest girl in the world and this is never going to go away.</p>
      <p>"That is the pinnacle point for me when I got severely depressed and it just spiralled out of control."</p>
