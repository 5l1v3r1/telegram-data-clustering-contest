      <h1>Court Sides with Nirvana in Copyright Infringement Lawsuit Against Marc Jacobs</h1>
      <h2>The “Bootleg Grunge” T-shirt and sweatshirt are still in question.</h2>

      <p>California federal court recently ruled in favor of grunge band <a href="http://www.hypebeast.com/tags/nirvana">Nirvana</a> in an ongoing case against fashion house <a href="http://www.hypebeast.com/tags/marc-jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a>. Back in December 2018, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/nirvana-marc-jacobs-lawsuit-smiley-face">Nirvana filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marc Jacobs</a> for stealing its iconic yellow and black smiley face design. Nirvana claimed the styles in question, called <a href="https://www.marcjacobs.com/bootleg-grunge-tee/M4007849.html?dwvar_M4007849_color=001&amp;dwvar_M4007849_size=XS">“Bootleg Grunge” T-shirt and sweatshirt</a>, ran afoul on its specific trademark for the yellow smiley associated with the word “Nirvana.” However, Marc Jacobs soon fired back with a motion to dismiss, claiming its modified version of the iconic graphic does not violate the grunge band’s trademark.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-court-just-sided-with-nirvana-and-refused-to-dismiss-its-case-against-marc-jacobs"><i>The Fashion Law</i></a>, the recent ruling decided that Nirvana maintains trademark rights of the smiley graphic and that Marc Jacobs’ version is close enough to be questioned. In addition to the obvious, Judge John Kronstadt added that “[Marc Jacobs’ products] have combined [Nirvana’s] protectable artwork with other distinctive elements of the Nirvana t-shirts, including through the use of yellow lines on black background and a similar type and placement for the text above the image on the clothing.” He also noted that consumers are likely to believe Nirvana is associated with Marc Jacobs’ items based on these similarities.</p>
      <p>As a result, the case will continue on in court.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the courtroom, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/jay-z-iconix-roc-nation-rocawear-end-legal-battle">Jay-Z and Iconix Brand Group have officially reached a settlement</a> for ongoing legal battles related to Roc Nation baseball caps.</p>
