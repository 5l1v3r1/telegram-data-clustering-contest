      <h1>Knights try to bounce back</h1>

      <p>The Letran Knights can still bounce back and deal the defending champion San Beda Red Knights their second loss of the season, and get away with the crown.</p>
      <p>This is what Knights’ coach Bonnie Tan vowed to do after the Red Lions pulled off a 79-76 triumph to tie their best-of-three series after Game 2 of the 95th National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball finals.</p>
      <p>Despite their loss, Tan is still satisfied at how things went as the Knights were able to hold their ground against the Red Lions in the championship. </p>
      <p>The series decider is set on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“No one really expected us to be here and go toe-to-toe with them and also give them their first loss after 32 victories,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>This time around, point guard Fran Yu is expected to be in better shape.</p>
      <p>In Game 2, Yu kept the Knights in the thick of the fight after they fell behind by as many as 15 points early in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old finished with 23 points, 19 in the second half. </p>
      <p>And that was before he got cramps on his left leg in the 3:41 mark of the fourth quarter with the Knights up by six, 72-66 at that time.</p>
      <p>Yu’s absence gave the Red Lions the chance to charge back in the game.</p>
