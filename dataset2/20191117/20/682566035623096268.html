      <p>Sao Paulo - <b>Max Verstappen</b> underlined his potential as a champion of the future on Sunday with a commanding victory for Red Bull in an astonishing and crash-hit <b>Brazilian Grand Prix</b> at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Dutchman twice passed newly-crowned six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton in a thrilling contest that had two safety car interventions and saw the Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc clash and retire, before clinching the eighth victory of his career.</p>
      <p>His third win this season also made up for his disappointment in last year's race in Brazil when he looked certain to win before a late accident wrecked his hopes of victory.</p>
      <p>He made the most of pole position and finished a dominant winner ahead of his former Red Bull team-mate Pierre Gasly, now with Toro Rosso, as they delivered a Honda-powered one-two for the Japanese company for the first time since the heyday of local hero Ayrton Senna.</p>
      <p>Frenchman Gasly came home 0.062 seconds ahead of Hamilton, who finished third for Mercedes but was demoted to seventh following a post-race stewards' investigation after crashing with luckless Thai driver Alexander Albon, the man who replaced Gasly at Red Bull, in the final laps.</p>
      <p>Hamilton's demotion gifted McLaren's Carlos Sainz his first Formula One podium.</p>
      <p>"Lewis was very quick," said Verstappen.</p>
      <p>"So I had to keep pushing all the time. He pitted early so we had to be on top of our pit-stops and we had a good move on him.</p>
      <p>"I could control the race with the tyres I had, so, for me, it was unbelievable. It was a lot of fun out there and great to win the race."</p>
      <p>He said his decisive second overtake of Hamilton was achieved thanks to his superior speed in the rarefied atmosphere of the 700-metre altitude Interlagos circuit.</p>
      <p>"I was behind so I was pushing flat out on my out lap," he said. "We knew we had great top speed the whole weekend - but that was a guess - and I'm very happy to have got past him!"</p>
      <p>Gasly screamed with delight at his good fortune on his slow-down lap.</p>
      <p>"This is my first podium in F1 and, for sure, I will never forget it," he said. It's such a special moment. So emotional...</p>
      <p>"Toro Rosso have given me such a fantastic car since I came back. This is an amazing day... I was praying for the engine to give everything it had - without Honda, it would not have been possible."</p>
      <p>Hamilton was handed a five-second penalty and two points on his racing licence.</p>
      <p>"I fully accept it was my fault and I accept the penalty," said the Mercedes driver.</p>
      <p>"I was the driver behind and it was my mistake. I apologise massively to Alex - the gap was there, but it closed pretty quickly. It was completely my fault and I hold my hands up."</p>
      <p>Albon, who looked certain to finish on the podium, came home 15th.</p>
      <p>Sainz finished fourth on the road for McLaren ahead of the two Alfa Romeos of Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi, seventh-placed Daniel Ricciardo of Renault and Lando Norris in the second McLaren.</p>
      <p>Sergio Perez of Racing Point finished ninth and Daniil Kvyat was 10th in the second Toro Rosso.</p>
