      <h1>Classless Redskins fan savagely rips TD ball away from young Jets supporter (Video)</h1>

      <p>An unfortunate ongoing theme during sporting events is that some fans simply do not know how to act — even the ones that are adults.</p>
      <p>And while they may be of a certain age, it’s embarrassing that some of them act less mature than young children.</p>
      <p>That was the case for one particular Redskins fan during Sunday’s game against the Jets at FedEx Field, when Robby Anderson jumped into the stands after scoring a TD. He handed the touchdown ball to a young Jets fan, when a savage Redskins supporter ripped the ball out of the kid’s hands.</p>

      <p>That’s absolutely disgusting. Crappy team — crappy fan base.</p>
