      <p>Thousands turned out to see singer Peter Andre turn on Southport's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> lights.</p>
      <p>Crowds packed out Lord Street for a day of entertainment which included performances by the I'm a Celebrity star plus Wet Wet Wet and Liberty X singer Kevin Simm and 80s Liverpool legend Sonia.</p>
      <p>The day kicked off with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-family">families</a> arriving from 1pm for fairground rides and street performances from children's entertainment company Starkidz and CBeebies presenter and star of Let's Play, Sid, who put on a funny and entertaining one-man show for the kids.</p>
      <p>TV presenter and former Heart Breakfast DJ Joel kicked off the evening programme from 4pm with panto stars taking the stage before the headliners.</p>
      <p>Crowds were then wowed by fireworks from the roof of The Atkinson as the lights were switched on to reveal Southport BIDâ€™s new lighting scheme for 2019, along with a spectacular light show tree.</p>
