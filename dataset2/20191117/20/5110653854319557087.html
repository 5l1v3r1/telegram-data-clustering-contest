      <p>Good news for those looking to find the TV channel for Bears vs. Rams on "<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-2019-monday-sunday-thursday-night-football-tv-channels/e2smds4hyeex10dl3racx2auo">Sunday Night Football</a>": This game, scheduled to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET, is being nationally televised by NBC in <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-11-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/r0rlms6mlk3l1finrne3igfiu">Week 11</a>. So yes, you get the game on TV.</p>
      <p>Sunday night's game marks the Bears' first of two appearances on NBC this season. The Rams, meanwhile, are making their second of three "Sunday Night Football" appearances scheduled for this season.</p>
      <p>The Bears lead the all-time series over the Rams by a wide margin — 53-35-3, including their last two meetings. Sunday night's game will mark the first time Chicago has visited the Rams since the team moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles ahead of the 2016 season.</p>
