      <p>Ian Wright is the cheeky chappie of ITV Sport; the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> forward who was known for his commanding presence and ability to hit the back of the net.</p>
      <p>But according to the Gunners legend, who is a contestant in this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, this wasn't always the case.</p>
      <p>Wright has previously admitted that he lacked confidence with women when growing up, adding that he lost his virginity "late" as he was "scared of that situation".</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old attributes feeling this way to not receiving a lot a love when growing up. But adds that things have now changed in his life, and he's hugs and kisses his sons to the point where it's "embarrassing".</p>

      <p>"I was very insecure during my teenage and adolescent years. I lost my virginity very late," Wright said on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04x5pd7/episodes/downloads">Fortunately with Fi And Jane podcast.</a></p>
      <p>"I was very scared of that situation, it was literally just after my 18th birthday. I closed myself off. I've learned how to love I didn't get a lot of love when I was younger.</p>
      <p>"I hug all the time now, to the point where it's embarrassing. I kiss my sons. I want to do it for myself. It's what I would have wanted.</p>
