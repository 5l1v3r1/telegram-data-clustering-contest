      <p>Lucknow - Teenage opener <b>Rahmanullah Gurbaz</b> hit an attacking half-century to set up <b>Afghanistan's 29-run</b> series-clinching win over the <b>West Indies</b> in the third Twenty20 international on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gurbaz hit 79 off 52 balls as Afghanistan posted 156 for eight, a total their bowlers defended by restricting the West Indies to 127/7 in Lucknow.</p>
      <p>They won the series 2-1 after losing the opening game and being swept in the preceding ODIs 3-0.</p>
      <p>Paceman Naveen-ul-Haq took three wickets to choke the West Indies' chase despite a valiant 52 by wicketkeeper-batsman Shai Hope.</p>
      <p>But it was the 17-year-old Gurbaz, a wicketkeeper-batsman, who stood out with his second T20I fifty after the Afghans were in early trouble at 12 for two.</p>
      <p>Gurbaz, named man of the match, put on a crucial 50-run stand for the fourth wicket with former captain Asghar Afghan, who made 24, and surpassed his previous T20I best of 61.</p>
      <p>He smashed six fours and five sixes before falling to West Indies skipper Kieron Pollard.</p>
      <p>Pacemen Sheldon Cottrell, Kesrick Williams and Keemo Paul took two wickets each.</p>
      <p>The West Indies lost regular wickets to falter in their chase against a disciplined Afghanistan attack that made the most of a slow track.</p>
      <p>Hope, who was dropped on 11 by Naveen off Gulbadin Naib, completed his second T20I fifty but got little support from the other end.</p>
      <p>Bowling all-rounder Karim Janat could not repeat his heroics from the second game where he claimed five wickets and scored 26 runs, but was named man of the series.</p>
      <p>The two teams will next play a one-off Test starting November 27.</p>
