      <p>Arsenal defeated rivals Tottenham 2-0 in front of a record FA Women’s Super League crowd of 38,262.</p>
      <p>After a goalless first half, Kim Little struck first in the north London derby before Holland striker Vivianne Miedema secured the victory in the 82nd minute.</p>
      <p>The game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium attracted a crowd seven times larger than last season’s WSL attendance record of 5,265.</p>

      <p>Liverpool sit last in the table after suffering a 1-0 defeat to Everton in the first-ever women’s Merseyside derby.</p>
      <p>Lucy Graham’s goal, scored just before half-time, was enough to secure victory for Willie Kirk’s Toffees at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Everton moved up to fourth in the table, whereas Liverpool’s poor start to the campaign continued as they are yet to secure a win.</p>
      <p>Chelsea remain at the top of the table after defeating Manchester United at Kingsmeadow.</p>

      <p>The only goal of the game was the result of a penalty awarded after United’s Millie Turner was deemed to have brought down Fran Kirby.</p>
      <p>Norway international Maren Mjelde duly converted the chance, keeping her side a point clear at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Georgia Stanway scored a brace in Manchester City’s dominant 5-0 victory over West Ham, only to be shown a red card in the 72nd minute.</p>
      <p>The England midfielder netted twice in quick succession before the break but then received two quickfire bookings for late challenges and was consequently dismissed.</p>
      <p>Ellen White opened the scoring, claiming her first WSL goal for City in the process.</p>
      <p>Stanway’s double followed with Lauren Hemp making it 4-0 before half-time, after which Tessa Wullaert claimed the fifth and final goal of the match.</p>

      <p>Brighton claimed their first victory of the season in emphatic style as they dismissed Birmingham 3-0.</p>
      <p>Kayleigh Green’s 15th-minute penalty handed the hosts the lead, awarded after Ellie Brazil was fouled and later withdrawn from the match.</p>
      <p>Lea Le Garrec doubled the advantage before half-time, hooking a shot off the bar before it rebounded into the goal.</p>
      <p>Green scored a second in the 70th minute, connecting with Le Garrec’s corner to complete the scoring.</p>

      <p>Bristol City drew 3-3 with Reading at the Madejski Stadium.</p>
      <p>Reading took control of proceedings early on, with Remi Allen and Brooke Chaplen both netting within a minute of each other.</p>
      <p>City’s Charlie Wellings reduced the deficit before the break, only for the Royals to strike again after the break as Angharad James headed in a third for the home side.</p>
      <p>Yana Daniels and Ebony Salmon both netted to ensure the visitors earned a share of the points.</p>
      <p>Reading’s Millie Farrow narrowly failed to provide a winner in the final minute when her attempt swung wide.</p>
