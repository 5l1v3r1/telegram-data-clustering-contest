      <h1>(Video) Brilliant clip emerges of an emotional Fabinho singing YNWA after famous win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:26:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Fabinho is Liverpool hard man, and perhaps the finest defensive midfielder playing in Europe at the moment. His contribution to our Champions League title will never be forgotten.</p>
      <p>A video clip has emerged of the Brazilian lined up with the players, singing along to our famous anthem ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ and he appears to get a little teary-eyed.</p>
      <p>By no means are we trying to shame the man, it’s just a beautiful moment to see such a powerful presence on the pitch touched by the club in this way.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Take a watch of the video below (via Esporte):</b>
