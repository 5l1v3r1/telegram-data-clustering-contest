      <h1>Carlos Sainz now under investigation for using DRS under yellow flag!</h1>

        <b>Shortly after being bumped up to his first-ever podium, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> has now been put under investigation for using DRS under a yellow flag situation, as the Spaniard is under threat to now lose <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a>'s first top three finish in several years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz managed to cross the line in fourth place after 71 laps at Interlagos despite starting in last place. The 25-year-old suffered engine issues during qualifying, meaning he wasn't able to set a time, meaning he stood at the back of the grid. </p>
      <p>However, as the Safety Cars started to come, the Madrid-born driver was able to unlap himself and gain several places, sitting pretty in fifth when the green flag was waved for the second time following the Ferrari crash.</p>

      <p>With <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> spinning because of contact with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>, Sainz went up to fourth and crossed the line in that position, and he even moved up to third post-race as Hamilton was dealt a five-second penalty for initiating contact with Albon.</p>

      <p>Now, however, Sainz could be receiving a penalty of his own and stripped of his first-ever podium in his 101st Grand Prix.</p>
