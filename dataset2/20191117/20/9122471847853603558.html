      <h1>This Joe Burrow-Justin Fields Stat Is Pretty Telling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:32:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Former Ohio State quarterback Joe Burrow has all but won the Heisman Trophy already, but current Buckeye signal caller Justin Fields has been dominant in his own right this season.</p>
      <p>Fields has completed 69.1 percent of his passes while throwing for 2,164 yards and a ridiculous 31-1 TD:INT ratio. He has also rushed for 377 yards and 10 scores.</p>
      <p>Burrow’s rushing stats (215 yards and three touchdowns) are lower than Fields’, but he’s thrown for 1,500 more yards and seven additional touchdowns (as well as five more INTs). However, the stats don’t tell the whole story.</p>
      <p>Fields has played significantly fewer reps in the second half of games this year, thanks to the fact Ohio State has been steamrolling opponents.</p>

      <p>Is Day correct in saying Fields would be “right there” for the Heisman if he played longer into games? Maybe.</p>
      <p>It is tough to argue against Burrow in any way, but the fact he’s had twice as many second half pass/rush attempts as Fields is noteworthy. How ridiculous would Fields’ stats be if he had those 78 missing attempts.</p>
      <p>It would be a service to college football fans everywhere to see these two QBs square off in a bowl.</p>
