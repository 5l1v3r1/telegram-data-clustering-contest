        <b>The first unit of the Peniche wave energy park has been successfully installed on the seabed, announced the Finnish company AW Energy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Through the company's official website, AW Energy's CEO, Christopher Ridgewell, confirms that the unit, the first to produce energy on a commercial scale, was installed "successfully" off the beach of Almagreira in Peniche, in the district of Leiria.</p>
      <p>Since the floating platform was submerged, technicians are monitoring performance 24/7 via remote control and testing to adjust the system for better performance.</p>
      <p>The first data collected "indicates that [the unit] Wave Roller is working well and its performance is in line with expectations.</p>
      <p>The assembly of the prototype for the commercial phase of producing electricity from wave motion, with an installed power of 350 kilowatts, was completed in mid-September in Peniche.</p>
      <p>Last week, the unit was towed to the site, submerged and installed on the high seas at a depth of 15 to 25 meters, near the coast. The next step is connection to the electricity grid.</p>
      <p>The technology consists of a vertical panel that moves with the sea currents, capturing energy that is transmitted to a hydraulic system and from there to a power plant.</p>
      <p>The company estimates that it will produce five megawatts (MW) of power, enough to supply 4,000 homes with electricity.</p>
      <p>The production of energy from waves, because it is less intermittent than wind or solar energy, has a potential equivalent to that of wind and solar energy together.</p>
      <p>Around 20% of the electricity consumed in Portugal and Spain comes from wind energy.</p>
      <p>AW Energy aims to create a large world park, with an installed capacity of between 50 and 100 MW, an investment that should amount to 100 million euros and put Portugal at the forefront in the segment of world wave energy production.</p>
