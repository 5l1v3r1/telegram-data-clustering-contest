      <h1>Rangers fan draws B&amp;Q into hilarious EBT response as DIY store makes demand</h1>
      <h2>The retail giant knows enough about Rangers' EBT situation to know they don't want to get involved!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:28:20+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> fan has drawn retail favourite B&amp;Q into a tongue-in-cheek response on social media after he pictured a brand of sealant labelled 'EBT+' on their shelves.</p>
      <p>The Gers-daft Twitter account @BazBowsk1 sent out the tweet, which now has over 200 likes, after seeing the Sika adhesive in store.</p>
      <p>In reference to Rangers' infamous employee benefit trust tax avoidance scheme he jokingly states: "there's B&amp;Q at it now".</p>
      <p>B&amp;Q, clearly in the mood for a little Sunday night banter, quickly responded saying: "Keep us out of it."</p>

      <p>The exchange comes after former owner Sir <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/david-murray">David Murray</a> 's regime's use of EBTs have come back into sharp focus with a report in the Times stating the Oldco <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> tax bill has been cut by millions.</p>
      <p>HMRC hit back at suggestions that there had been a miscalculation in a letter to the newspaper's Scottish editor Magnus Lewellyn.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Jim Harra said: "The article is incorrect: HMRC did not make any mistakes that led to the club's insolvency.</p>
      <p>"HMRC won again Rangers' tax avoidance in the Supreme Court."</p>
