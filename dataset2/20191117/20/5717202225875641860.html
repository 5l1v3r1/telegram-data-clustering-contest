      </p>
      <p>Sky Sports reports that Long had come onto West Ham United’s radar in the summer. However, the report notes that a move to the London Stadium was thwarted because of an inability to secure a work permit.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11700/11863312/southampton-offered-chance-to-sign-usa-defender-aaron-long">But Sky Sports reports</a> that the 27-year-old has now been offered to Southampton. It is also suggested that Long – who has a release clause of around £4.6 million – is wanted by Marseille heading into the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Long scored two goals in 25 appearances for the Red Bulls this past season. He also played alongside Saints youngster Josh Sims who has spent the second-half of the year on loan in Major League Soccer.</p>

      <h3>TBR View – Long move will not appease worried Saints fans</h3>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Ralph Hasenhuttl decides to make a move for Long. A move would obviously not be a huge financial gamble due to his release clause. However, it is still a risk.</p>
      <p>Southampton certainly need to improve their defensive options in January. But the supporters will not be happy if £4.6 million is all that is spent on improving their ranks at the back.</p>
      <p>Long could prove to be an inspired signing. But the fans will certainly be worried if too much faith is put in him in January given the precarious situation Southampton find themselves in.</p>
