      <h1>Bears vs. Rams odds, prediction, betting trends for 'Sunday Night Football'</h1>

      <p>When the Bears (4-5) travel to face the Rams on Sunday night (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC) in the penultimate game of Week 11, both teams will put their fading NFC wild-card chances on the line.</p>
      <p>Chicago is coming off a comeback home win over Detroit, while Los Angeles struggled to score enough in Pittsburgh. Both quarterbacks, Mitchell Trubisky and Jared Goff, have faced much criticism for their respective shaky play this season.</p>
      <p>With two strong defenses on the field, here's how we see the game possibly playing out between the two long-time conference rivals:</p>

      <h3>Betting odds for 'Sunday Night Football'</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spread:</b> Rams by 6</li>
        <li><b>Point total:</b> 40</li>
        <li><b>Odds:</b> Bears -102, Rams -108</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Rams are getting three extra points beyond the home-field advantage. The Bears should be well represented with many fans at the game, but it's still a long road trip for a team that hasn't traveled well in 2019.</p>
      <h3>Bears vs. Rams all-time series</h3>
      <p>The Bears lead the series 54-36-3. They have won six of the past seven meetings going back to 2006. The Rams last won in a 42-21 blowout in 2013. This is the first time the Bears have played the Rams in Los Angeles since 1994.</p>
      <h3>Three trends to know</h3>
      <p>— 55 percent of spread bettors like the Bears. Sixty-six percent of moneyline bettors like the Bears, too.</p>
      <p>— 63 percent of bettors like the game to go over the rather low point total of 40.</p>
      <p>— The Bears had lost and failed to cover in four consecutive games before doing both against the Lions last week. The Rams have lost as favorites in three prior games.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Three things to watch</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Allen Robinson vs. Jalen Ramsey</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears' best wide receiver will no doubt be covered tightly by the Rams' shutdown corner. Ramsey took JuJu Smith-Schuster out of the game in Week 10, and Robinson is clearly Trubisky's top target. Robinson must break through to make key plays for his quarterback.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Montgomery in or out</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears' talented rookie feature back is a game-time decision with an ankle injury. If he's out, it would be a committee of scatback Tarik Cohen and undrafted rookie Ryan Nall trying to help a sputtering offense.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Khalil Mack and Aaron Donald</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mack, the No. 5 overall pick in the 2014 draft, is the Bears' primary disruptor, well beyond his tough edge rush in their 3-4. Donald, the No. 13 overall pick in the 2014 draft, is the man responsible for getting the Rams' defensive damage going up front in their 3-4. They will both look to change the game against Goff and Trubisky, respectively.</p>
      <h3>Stat that matters</h3>
      <p>Goff is only 5-4 during regular-season night games in his career. He has rated 92.5 in those games with 8 interceptions.</p>
      <h3>Bears vs. Rams prediction</h3>
      <p>The Bears will win a defensive struggle with the better overall defense. They will have a little more success moving the ball with their running backs and complementary receivers than the Rams. With a game that feels like it's at Soldier Field, the result is a mild upset.</p>
