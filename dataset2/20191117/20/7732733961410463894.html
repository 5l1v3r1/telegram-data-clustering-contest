      <h1>Hacked Disney+ accounts are being sold on the dark web</h1>
      <h2>Thousands of hacked accounts surfaced on the dark web hours after the Disney+ launch</h2>

      <h4>Cutting corners: You may not think there's a market for hacked streaming accounts, but the hijacked Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime accounts that regularly show up for sale within hacking communities paint a different picture. With the recent launch of the highly-anticipated Disney+ streaming service, there's now a new commodity: hacked Disney+ accounts.</h4>
      <p>Disney's long awaited streaming service launched last week to much fanfare, notching an impressive <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82757-disney-attracts-10-million-subscribers-first-day.html">10 million subscribers on its first day</a>. However, of those 10 million new customers, not everyone was happy; Disney+ launched with a <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82735-disney-stumbles-high-demand-leads-launch-day-login.html">slew of technical difficulties</a>, and even the Disney+ website was knocked offline at one point.</p>
      <p>Technical woes tend to be expected when a new service arrives, but what wasn't expected was hundreds (thousands?) of accounts being hijacked and thrust onto the dark web for sale mere hours after the Disney+ launch.</p>

      <p>Twitter was bombarded with many tweets similar to the above, and there's more than a few threads about it over at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/">r/DisneyPlus</a>. Users reported that their passwords were changed and they were logged out of all devices. In a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">report</a> by ZDNet, at least two users confessed to recycling passwords from other accounts. Still, other users online have insisted they used unique passwords for their Disney+ account. So, it isn't presently clear how hackers came into possession of the accounts.</p>
      <p>Now, hacking forums on the dark web have been inundated with the hijacked accounts, with prices for the account credentials ranging between $3 and $7, per ZDNet's reporting. In some cases, the hackers were offering access to the accounts for free, as Disney+ currently permits account sharing.</p>
      <p>As of writing, Disney hasn't addressed the issue publicly, but the most advisable suggestion is to create unique, strong passwords -- something <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/79747-millions-people-use-123456-their-password.html">millions of people apparently still struggle with</a>. Disney would also be wise to implement 2FA, which would fortify accounts against lazy hacking attempts.</p>
