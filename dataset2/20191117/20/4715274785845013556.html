      <p>Rain or Shine is not done just yet.</p>
      <p>The Elasto Painters staved off elimination with a fiery finish to escape No. 2 Meralco, 83-81, and stay in the hunt for a spot in the quarterfinals in the 2019 Philippine Basketball Association Governors’ Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Richard Ross was brilliant all game, scoring a game-high of 26 points with 12 rebounds for a double-double, while Rey Nambatac was equally as impressive, dropping 24 points  to power Rain or Shine.</p>

      <p>Rain or Shine finished with a 4-7 mark and will now await its fate.</p>
      <p>Its placing will be determined depending on the result of the final games of Alaska and NorthPort.</p>
      <p>It can either get a quarter’s berth if the quotient system favors it or it might play a playoff for No. 8, the last ticket to the next round.</p>
      <p>The Bolts, with the loss, ended the eliminations at 8-3, and they have to settle for the second seed.</p>
      <p>Meralco also saw its five-game winning streak snapped and will enter the quarters on a losing note.</p>
      <p>Still, the Bolts will get to enjoy a twice-to-beat incentive in the next round against a lower ranked team.</p>
      <p>With their backs against the wall, the Elasto Painters dug deep in the fourth when it seemed that they are headed for the exit.</p>
      <p>Down 60-69 with under eight minutes remaining, Rain or Shine uncorked a game-turning 17-2 surge midway the fourth to suddenly earn a 77-71 lead following a Nambatac triple with 4:18 remaining.</p>
      <p>Still in it, the Bolts inched closer and got within two, 81-83, in the dying seconds with ball in hand following a steal from Allen Durham.</p>
      <p>However, Durham and Raymund Almazan failed to convert on close range shots, enabling Rain or Shine to keep the win and its campaign alive.</p>
      <p>Durham paced Meralco in the losing cause with his double-double with 23 markers and 16 boards, while Almazan and Baser Amer each added 18.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, Barangay Ginebra (7-3) and NorthPort (4-6) are locked in another critical battle for key positioning.</p>
      <p>The Batang Pier are trying to book a seat in the quarters while the Gin Kings look to improve their seeding in the top four.</p>
