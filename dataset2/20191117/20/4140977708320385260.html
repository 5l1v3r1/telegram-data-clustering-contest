            <b>MAH Vs PUN Dream11 Team, Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: A win for either side sky rockets it straight to the pinnacles of the group.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Group C of the Syed Mushtaq Ali is the pinch perfect testament to the grilling, arduous and rigorous brand of close fought cricket being doled out in the marquee tournamnet. With six sides all placed on 16 points, each match comes bearing with it gargantuan ramifications in a bid to determine which teams will be making it into the ensuing round of the domestic T20 tournamnet in the Indian cricketing arena.</p>
          <p>For today’s opponents, anything else than a win could prove to be disastrous owing to a slew of reasons. Both Maharashtra and Punjab find themselves perched adjacent to each other in fourth and fifth position respectively, separated only by the barest margins of net run-rate. The winner will not only end up occupying top place in the group but also put massive difference over each other, making the four points worth gold.</p>

                <p>Maharashtra carry into the tie a two match winning spree, one which was given birth by a comfortable 8 wicket win in their recent outing. Needing 136 to win, the run chase couldn’t have gotten any easier for them as the side cruised to a win with an over to spare, a result they’ll be looking to emulate against a Punjab unit which has lost just once in their last five occasions.</p>
                <p>The home side make an advent into the clash having bundled out Chhattisgarh for 150 in pursuit the 170 set by Punjab. With both the sides carrying such pristine form into today’s affair, this looks set to be a cracker of a contest, a jaffer which will keep us riveted right till the closing stages.  </p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Being a morning match means the side bating first will be looking to step out and capitalise on the solid batting conditions to pile on the runs before the wicket starts waning and wavering to regress. The spinners will get help in abundance as the match runs down its course with the ball stopping, gripping and turning in the second part to lead the side winning the toss choosing to bat first today.</p>

                            <h3>MAH Vs PUN Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 136 runs till now in the league, Punjab’s <b>Simran Singh</b> has kept chipping in with vital runs across his stay in the marquee league to see us opt for the side’s wicket-keeper for today’s forthcoming encounter. We are also getting in Maharastra’s wicket-keeper for the match with <b>Naushad Shaikh</b> having gotten in 158 runs for his side till now.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs PUN Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>The batsmen lining up this docket of today’s match are exemplary and exuberant, wordclass names who have regaled us in resplendent displays across their stay in the ongoing edition of the tournamnet. It sees us shelving out a staggering amount to indulge in the services of these myriad names, players who are bound to continue in their riveting ways today as well.</p>
                            <p>We begin with <b>Anmolpreet Singh</b> from Punjab with the bat having flourished and thrived in the T20 format, one which has lead to see behemoth rise in the Indian arena. His 195 runs till now make him a must have one for the day alongside <b>Shubman Gill</b> while from Maharashtra we are getting in <b>Ruturaj Gaikwad</b> given his behemoth 272 runs in 6 outings which have seen him become the focal point of his team’s batting order.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs PUN Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Over first pick for the MAH vs PUN All-rounders would be <b>Kedar Jadhav. </b>He might have been shunned out of the Indian setup at the moment but the player has gone onto thrive in the domestic fraternity with the Syed Ali Mushtaq Trophy seeing him recover his lost touch. He has emerged as a beacon of light with the bat for Maharashtra this time around, someone whose expansive strokeplay has seen him amass a bagful of runs. </p>
                            <p><b>Shamshuzama Kazi</b> be accompanying him for the day given the slower brand of bowling the rank turner will be roping out while from Punjab we are selecting <b>Gurkeerat Singh Mann</b> given the 100 runs he has garnered up in 10 matches.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs PUN Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p><b>Mayank Markande</b> is yet to hit his stride but this is a wicket which he is going to rejoice while bowling on. The legspinner is going to be deployed extremely judiciously by his side with his turning away ball making for a travesty to peel off for the bats.</p>
                            <p>From Maharashtra on the other hand we have opted for their leading wicket taker first with <b>Satyajeet Bachhav</b> having snagged 8 wickets in 6 matches with <b>Azim Kazi</b> partnering him up to bring down the curtains on our Dream 11 side for the day.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs PUN Dream11 Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We will be venturing into this clash with Anmolpreet Singh as the captain while Gaikwad is the vice-captain.</p>
