      <p>There will be no more shouts of “let’s get ready to juuuungle” as the new series of I'm A Celebrity is now underway.</p>
      <p>The ITV ratings winner, won by North East lasses Vicky Pattison and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/scarlett-moffatt">Scarlett Moffatt</a> in 2015 and 2016 respectively returns to our screens on Sunday night for its 19th series - we’re all of a sudden feeling very old!</p>
      <p>As ever, this year’s <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-lineup-confirmed-16118148">I'm A Celebrity lineup</a> unites a very eclectic mix of famous faces with everyone from Ian Wright to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn Jenner.</a></p>
      <p>Other celebs in the mix for 2018 include Nadine Coyle, Kate Garraway and Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>As we’ve come to realise, the return of I’m A Celebrity means that Christmas is just around the corner but how long will the new series last?</p>
      <p>
        <b>How long is I’m A Celebrity on for?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the exact end date is still being kept under wraps, I’m A Celebrity traditionally runs for three weeks, meaning we should have our new King or Queen of the Jungle by December 7.</p>
      <p>The series launches with a bumper episode on Sunday, November 17 and is set to run for either an hour or 90 minutes every night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When do people start getting voted out?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Typically, the celeb campers have around two weeks to settle in before being given the boot, so expect the first elimination to come towards the end of next week.</p>
