      <p>Bryan is Ronald Acuña Sr.’s third son, and he was one of 116 participants in Major League Baseball’s Trainer Partnership International Showcase. The youngest Acuña son is 14, so he won’t be eligible to sign until 2021. Their father, Ronald Sr., signed with the Mets in 1997, Ronald Jr. signed with the Braves in 2015 and the middle son, Luisangel, signed with the Rangers last year.</p>
      <p>The Acuñas’ extended family has further baseball ties, too, including Jose Escobar, Alcides Escobar, Kelvim Escobar, Edwin Escobar and Vicente Campos, all of whom reached the Majors at some point.</p>
