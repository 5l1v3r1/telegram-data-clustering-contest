      <h3>By Jonathan Moyo, via social media..#November2017CoupMoments</h3>
      <p>1,Sight after crossing Ruya River into Mozambique. At this time #TrevorNcube was lying on @Twitter  &amp; to readers of his newspapers that we were under arrest at KGVI barracks. The other gentleman is a Mozambican. Details are in a coup story, yet to be told!</p>
      <p>2,Ruya River was drought-dry in Nov 2017, with no crocodile; we crossed it into Mozambique by motorbike &amp; were received by Sekuru Dzenga of Dzenga Village at 4am. Rested for an hour; proceeded to Mazowe to catch a lift to Tete and flew to Maputo next day!</p>

      <p>3,And the last installment in this Coup Story is this souvenir I’m keeping to bequeath to my grandchildren. I used the cap from the day we started our 19-hour long coup-escape from Harare to Dzenga Village in Mozambique; until 15 November 2018. Take care!</p>

      <p>4,ADDENDUM: Cde  @Hon_Kasukuwere filmed the video on his fone. From Dzenga Village we went to Mazowe &amp; then Tete for the night. Flew to Maputo 21/11/17. From airport we went straight to President Nyusi’s office. He was waiting for us. The rest is history!</p>
