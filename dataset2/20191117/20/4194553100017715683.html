      <h1>(Video) “I’m an old head now”: Ox talks mental strength through injury problems with England</h1>

      <p>Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has made a big comeback this year, as he’s shone for both club and country in 2019.</p>
      <p>The last year or so has been very difficult for the No.15 with him unfortunately sitting out massive periods of some serious games.</p>
      <p>But he was thankfully a part of the squad that won the Champions League, so I’m sure he’s happy to be back with a bang.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has now spoken out about his mental strength throughout the difficult period, and his hopes for the future.</p>
      <p>As he puts it himself, he’s “an old head now”.</p>
      <p>
