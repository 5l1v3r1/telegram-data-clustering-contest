      <h1>Digital bank Up is offering a bonus $5 for new signups that register for and use Google Pay</h1>

      <p>We’ve written about aussie digital bank <a href="https://ausdroid.net/company/up/">Up</a> a bit, with good reason – we’re pretty fond of their approach to banking, with fast signup and a lovely, well-designed app that lets you integrate with Google Pay from the beginning.</p>
      <p>If you’re not already an Up customer, the company is running a promotion to encourage you to sign up and get going. The first 10,000 signups from November 11 until the end of the year who set up and use Google Pay 5 times within 10 days will receive the $5 bonus.</p>
      <p>You can get up and running with Up inside 3 minutes, and get provisioned for Google Pay almost immediately. If you’re eligible for the $5 Google Pay promotion, you’ll see a message about it in the app. Find the details page for the offer on Up’s website <a href="https://up.com.au/googlepaybonus/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you feel like sharing the love around, you should check out Up’s referral program as well: sign your mates “up” for Up, and you can both get a $5 credit, and they’ll get the Google Pay $5 bonus on top.<br/><i>Are you an Up user?
