      <p>Quenton Nelson's touchdown in the third quarter of the Colts' Week 11 game against the Jaguars on Sunday did not count. Upon replay review, he was ruled short of the goal line.</p>
      <p>But the touchdown celebration the All-Pro guard delivered before the play was reviewed might have been the best in the NFL this season.</p>

      <p>Nelson, who lined up as a fullback on a third-and-goal from Jacksonville's 1-yard line, lunged forward and appeared to score. Once he and his teammates emerged from the pile, a fantastic keg stand celebration ensued.</p>

      <p>So great.</p>
      <p>After the call was reversed and Nelson's touchdown was wiped off the board, Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett found Marcus Johnson for a touchdown on the next play.</p>
      <p>Nelson's celebration, however, will live on forever.</p>
