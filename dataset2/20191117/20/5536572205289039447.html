      <p>While the rest of the Jets prepared for their Week 1 opener against the Buffalo Bills, Avery Williamson was getting ready to go under the knife.</p>
      <p>The Jets linebacker had surgery back in September to repair his torn ACL and effectively end his season before it even began.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old got tired of not suiting up on game day’s so he grabbed his full uniform and pads, put them on….and went shopping.</p>
      <p>Yes, he showed up at a local grocery store like this.</p>
