      <p>INDIANAPOLIS -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139605/marlon-mack">Marlon Mack</a> fractured his hand during Sunday's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/jax/jacksonville-jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.</p>
      <p>Mack will undergo more tests to determine whether he needs surgery and how long he will miss, but he will not play Thursday night against the Texans, per the source.</p>
      <p>Mack was having his best game since Week 5 at Kansas City before getting hurt early in the third quarter. He had rushed 14 times for 109 yards, including four runs of at least 10 yards before the injury.</p>
      <p>It's uncertain how Mack hurt his hand.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980077/jonathan-williams">Jonathan Williams</a> became the Colts' primary running back after Mack's injury, with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916430/nyheim-hines">Nyheim Hines</a> backing him up.</p>
