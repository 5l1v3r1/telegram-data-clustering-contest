      <h3>How is Martin Kemp best known?</h3>
      <p>Martin originally found fame with the 80s band Spandau Ballet, which also featured his older brother Gary Kemp, along with members Tony Hadley (who was on I’m A Celebrity in 2015), John Keeble and Steve Norman.</p>
      <p>He played bass in the band, who scored a string of hits during the decade including To Cut A Long Story Short, Chant No 1, Gold, Only When You Leave and the classic chart-topper True.</p>

      <p>Away from music, Martin has also had a successful acting career, appearing alongside Gary as Ronnie and Reggie Kray in 1990’s The Krays.</p>
      <p>While he also had roles in various US TV series, he’s probably best remembered as EastEnders villain Steve Owen, joining the soap in 1998.</p>
      <p>Steve was not only the dad of Mel (Tamzin Outhwaite) Owen’s son Hunter, but was also involved in some huge storylines during his four years on the show.</p>

      <p>Among these were the murder of his ex-girlfriend Saskia Duncan, a crime for which he framed his employee Matthew Rose (Joe Absalom), as well as his ongoing feud with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden).</p>

      <p>Steve came to a fiery end in 2002 when, while trying to flee Albert Square after his feud with Phil escalates further, he crashed his car into a wall and died in the subsequent explosion.</p>
      <p>His son Hunter (Charlie Winter) also met a premature end in Walford earlier this year after escaping from prison and holding the Queen Vic under siege, while Mel was seen dying in a car accident earlier this week.</p>
