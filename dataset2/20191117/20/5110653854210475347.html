      <h1>Who plays on 'Sunday Night Football' tonight? Time, TV channel, schedule for Week 11</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:12:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>Tonight's "<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-2019-monday-sunday-thursday-night-football-tv-channels/e2smds4hyeex10dl3racx2auo">Sunday Night Football</a>" game looked a lot better when the NFL scheduled it months ago, before both the Bears and the Rams started struggling through this point of the 2019 season. Yet a <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-11-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/r0rlms6mlk3l1finrne3igfiu">Week 11</a> matchup between two teams fighting desperately to remain in the NFC playoff picture should make for an entertaining battle.</p>
      <p>This game, scheduled to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC from Los Angeles, pits the 4-5 Bears against the 5-4 Rams. The defending NFC champion, LA is favored by -6 1/2 points over Chicago, a massive line that led Sporting News to pick Bears over Rams as our <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/u5np7y4smrzt1jdzpvoum8qln">upset of the week</a>.</p>
      <p>Part of the struggles for both Chicago and LA has been the well-documented and shaky play of their quarterbacks. Yet, the Bears and Rams have reasons to believe Mitchell Trubisky and Jared Goff will perform to par Sunday night.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Trubisky passed for 3 touchdowns and no interceptions in last week's win over the Lions, with his 131 passer rating marking the third time in his career he has hit 130 or better. The Bears QB also has a 2-0 record in his only two career road starts against NFC West teams.</p>
      <p>As for Goff, it's all about playing at home. The Rams QB has 3,279 passing yards, 23 TDs, 4 INTs and a 106.6 passer rating over his last 10 starts in LA. And as good as Trubisky has been on the road against the NFC West, Goff has been even better at home against the NFC North — as evidenced by his 8 TDs, 0 INTs, 380 yards per game and 143 rating in those two such games.</p>
      <p>Below is all the info you need to watch <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/bears-rams-channel-schedule-time-sunday-night-football-game/itartepwwyd0193efgwxly6df">Bears vs. Rams</a>on Sunday night, including the TV channels and kickoff time.</p>
      <h3>Who plays on Sunday Night Football tonight?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Matchup</b>: Chicago Bears at Los Angeles Rams</li>
        <li><b>Kickoff time</b>: 8:20 p.m. ET</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inour Week 11NFL picks against the spread and straight-up predictions, Sporting News is split on Sunday night's game. Below are the explanations for each pick.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/u5np7y4smrzt1jdzpvoum8qln/3">Pick against the spread</a>:Mitchell Trubisky used the Lions to break out of a massive slump while Jared Goff went deeper into his struggles against the Steelers. The Bears can run the ball on the Rams to make Trubisky comfortable while the Rams face more tough sledding for Todd Gurley and more pressure on Goff. Chicago should have a good fan presence, as well, Sunday night in Los Angeles. <i>Pick: Bears win 23-20</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-predictions/1sb3n5rbwqxjg1elyenztbbj0s/13">Straight-up prediction</a>:Before the season, anybody could have reasonably stated this Week 11 matchup was a preview of a playoff game in the NFC. It technically still could be, but neither the Bears nor the Rams inspire much optimism. The Bears finally showed some signs of offensive life in their win over the Lions last week, but the Rams, despite some struggles of their own, still have the more trustworthy attack. LA's defense will get back on track, and coach Sean McVay will scheme his way to enough points for a win. <i>Pick: Rams 24, Bears 17</i>.</p>
