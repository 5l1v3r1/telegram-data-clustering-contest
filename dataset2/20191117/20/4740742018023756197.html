      <h1>War of the Worlds hits our screen tonight after filming in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>The adaptation is the latest big production which used Bristol as its backdrop</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:53:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Alien epic The War of the Worlds is hitting our screens this evening - and eagled-eyed viewers should be able to recognise a number of Bristol locations in the drama.</p>
      <p>Originally a novel written in 1897 by HG Wells,  the three-part<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bbc"> BBC </a>series tells of plucky humans fighting a superior race.</p>
      <p>The story sees astronomers detect a transmission from another galaxy and realise it is proof of alien life.</p>
      <p>Within days mankind is all but wiped out, leaving pockets of humanity in an eerily deserted world.</p>
      <p>Back in February, film crews were spotted on a number of streets in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/eastville">Eastville</a> area of the city shooting the drama.</p>

      <p>Emergency services were also roped into to help production teams has they filmed under the city's M32 motoway.</p>
      <p>Golden Globe winner Gabriel Byrne and actress Elizabeth McGovern, who previously starred in  <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/downton-abbey">Downton Abbey</a> , will lead the cast.</p>
