        <b>England buried the memory of Raheem Sterling’s bust-up with Joe Gomez by beating Montenegro 7-0 and Kosovo 4-0</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate claimed England have emerged stronger after working through the bust-up between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez and ending their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with emphatic victories.</p>
      <p>After being left out of the squad for England’s 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro following his behind-the-scenes clash with Gomez, Sterling was restored to Southgate’s side for their campaign-closing 4-0 victory over Kosovo and was involved in goals scored by Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p>Southgate praised the way his players pulled together and indicated he is happy with the progress they are making with the European Championship seven months away.</p>
      <p>“You have to work through any difficulties you might have,” Southgate told ITV. “The whole group have done that really well and I think we’ve come out of this stronger than we started it, quite frankly.</p>
      <p>“We’re further ahead in being more settled in the group and the way we want to play and players understanding our principles of play.</p>
      <p>“There is really good competition and we wanted to learn a few things tonight, that we certainly did.”</p>

      <p>Harry Winks opened the scoring at Stadiumi Fadil Vokrri with his first international goal – a feat that was matched by second-half substitute Mason Mount, who scored in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Winks admitted England’s defensive lapses allowed Kosovo to compete, while underlining his commitment to the team regardless of whether Southgate plays him in a deep-lying role or as an attacking midfielder.</p>
      <p>“I like to be able to play both positions,” Winks said on ITV. “I consider myself someone who can be in that pivot [position] and be in that eight if needed as well.</p>
      <p>“There’s always moments we need to improve on. It was the same in the Montenegro game, we gave away a few sloppy chances and we need to work on that because, come the Euros, we’ll come up against stronger opposition than them and they might punish us.”</p>
      <p>Kane, whose strike took his tally to 12 goals in qualifying, echoed his Tottenham team-mate’s comments, while reflecting upon England’s strong finish to the game.</p>
      <p>“We went through a few spells where they had a bit of pressure,” he told ITV. “But we soaked it up and towards the end, when the spaces started to open up, it was clinical and 4-0 is a great result.</p>
      <p>“We know we can improve. Tonight was difficult: the pitch was poor and it was hard to play, and there’s always going to be little mistakes.</p>
      <p>“When we play better teams we’ve got to make sure we’re on it.”</p>
