      <p>Ezekiel Elliott has had some entertaining touchdown celebrations in the past, and today he borrowed one from his quarterback’s pregame routine.</p>
      <p>Before Dallas’ game against the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday night, Dak Prescott’s pre-game workout caught people’s attention. A clip of Prescott performing a drill designed to get his hips snapping around into his throws went viral.</p>
      <p>Well, after Elliott scored a touchdown on a 17-yard reception from Prescott against the Detroit Lions today, he broke out the “Dak” as a celebration.</p>

      <p>After a slow start–he fumbled on his first carry of the day–Elliott has gotten things going in Detroit.</p>
      <p>He only has 44 yards rushing on 14 carries but has scored a touchdown on the ground in addition to the receiving one above.</p>
      <p>Dallas leads Detroit 35-28 midway through the fourth quarter. A win would lift the Cowboys into first place in the NFC East pending the result of the Philadelphia Eagles-New England Patriots game later this afternoon.</p>
