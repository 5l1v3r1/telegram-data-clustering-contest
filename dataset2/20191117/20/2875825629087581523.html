      <p>Iconic boy band Westlife left fans annoyed as they took to the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> ballroom at Blackpool Tower to perform together for the first time in years.</p>
      <p>Despite the big reunion, fans were left incredibly frustrated as they struggled to hear the band perform.</p>
      <p>The cheering Strictly audience infuriated fans, who blasted their clapping for being too loud.</p>
      <p>The British public took to Twitter to share their anger towards the cheering and clapping on tonight's results show.</p>
      <p>One shared on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "Wish they audience would stop clapping so we could actually hear westlife sing, so bloody annoying every week <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrictlyComeDancing?src=hashtag_click">#StrictlyComeDancing</a></p>
