      <p>Sadio Mane is one of the best players in the world – I don’t think anyone would argue with that statement, and these last two years he has proved himself as one of the finest finishers in the game.</p>
      <p>The Senegal international finds himself on the left side of Liverpool’s attack, and sometimes he is forced to to strike the ball with his weaker, left foot.</p>
      <p>Turns out he’s not too shabby with it! Reddit user Zagado890 has created a video compilation of Mane scoring with his weaker foot.</p>
