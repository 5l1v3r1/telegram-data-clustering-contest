      <p>Ariana Grande gave fans an update on her health, and sadly, it’s not great. Grande posted a <a href="https://people.com/music/ariana-grande-so-much-pain-very-sick-update-health-tour/">lengthy note</a> to Instagram explaining how she’s trying to work through her current health ailments.</p>
      <p>“Hi everyone so I have a quick health update, I just finished my show in Charlottesville and I’ve been sick since the last show in London,” she wrote on Instagram. “I’ve been coughing and had this like crazy sinus infection thing that has not gone away for a really long time. I haven’t been able to really get better and tonight during the show tonight my head was really splitting and heavy and my glands really hurt and I’m trying to figure out what’s going on.”</p>
      <p>Grande added that she may have to cancel future shows and wanted to give her fans forewarning just in case.</p>
      <p>“I’m scared that I might have to cancel some things, so this is kind just a heads up of like I don’t know what’s happening with my body,” she continued. “And I’m really disappointed and freaked out of why I can’t get better because it’s been over three weeks at this point.”</p>
      <p>Despite the health problems, Grande also thanked her fans for their support during her tour, adding that she’s “looking forward to the rest of it.”</p>
