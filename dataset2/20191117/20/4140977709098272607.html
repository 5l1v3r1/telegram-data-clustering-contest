          </p>
          <p>A 10-2 record, three wins in succession and sitting atop of the Western Conference. This finally looks to be the season when Los Angeles Lakers will be setting down a marker and challenging for the prestigious conference and league title, a rhetoric which the side’s ardent and avid supporters have been long left yearning for.</p>
          <p>It’s not just the position which the side occupy as things stand but also the performances which they have doled out which have made heads turn and seen people stand up and take attention of their resounding brand of football. This is a side lined up with worldclass performers, players who have finally seen the side overhaul their underachieving form and unlock the true potential of the outfit.</p>

                <p>The team tasted consummate success in the last encounter, a thriller of an affair which epitomised the composure requite to win the coveted trophy. A 99-97 win over Sacramento Kings saw their outing go down right to the closing stages, seeing the side hang onto a win by the finest of margins, a win which is set to imbibe immense momentum when they approach Atlanta Hawks today.</p>
                <p>For Eastern Conference’s Atlanta Hawks meanwhile, things have been far from solace filled. The team is dwindling and regressive, coming into today’s match having been cut short and blown apart by LA Clippers only yesterday. The 150-101 battering saw them beg handed over their eighth defeat in 12 encounters and second on the bounce to slump down to 11th place in their conference. </p>

                            <h3>LAL vs ATL Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>Finally back from injury in the side’s last encounter, Atlanta Hawks’ point guard Evan Turner will be enshrined into our side for this encounter. The 15 minutes he got yesterday were enough for him to immerse us in his riveting and extradonaire brand of basketball with the player garnering the 15 points, 1 rebound and 5 assists, numbers which are only bound to increase as his role escalates for this one.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile we have the one player come in as well in the form of Rajon Rondo. His season has been reminiscent to Turner with the side’s point guard having made a recovery from his foregone injury only recently.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs ATL Dream11 Shooting Guard </h3>
                            <p>Every match requires us to go in for one cheap player to help free up funds elsewhere and for this match, the visiting side’s Kevin Huerter will be taking over that onus for us today. The player is someone who has doled out some scintillating displays in the limited time he’s gotten on the court, seeing us entrust faith in him for today’s scrimmage.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs ATL Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>In every match where Los Angeles Lakers have been in focus, LeBron James has been an instant pick for us. The small forward has picked up the most assists for his side at 10, laying up the ball impeccably for his counterparts and up against a paper thin defence, he’s going to send down open treys at will as well today.</p>
                            <p>With Avery Bradley out for today’s encounter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will be roped in by Los Angeles Lakers for this clash, seeing us make him the second option from the side in this docket.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs ATL Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>The fulcrum of his side’s consummate success, this side has been all about Anthony Davis in the Los Angeles Lakers contingent. The player has put in quirky displays with his electric performances seeing him become the side’s leading scorer at 25.5 points along with raking up the 9.9 rebounds as well to see him become a fulcrum in defence as well for them.</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs ATL Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>JaVale McGee retains his position in our given the points he’s recorded in the paint with the player not only positioning himself for the layups but ensuring he’s the first to lunge onto deflections and rebounds as well. From Atlanta Hawks on the other hand we are moving in with Alex Len, someone who’ll be asked to put in a flawless and dependable display in defence and come up with a slew of steals and blocks if his side are to have any chance of winning today</p>
                            <h3>LAL vs ATL Dream11 Star Player</h3>
                            <p>Davies is yet again being made our side’s captain for the day.</p>
