      <p>The first weekend of schoolies celebrations have wrapped up on the Gold Coast, with police revealing they’re generally pleased with crowd behaviour.</p>
      <p>There were more ‘toolies’ than schoolies arrested on the glitter strip overnight, with 10 non-schoolies taken into custody.</p>
      <p>It’s understood they were mostly for public nuisance offences.</p>
      <p>Just five schoolies, all males, were arrested mainly for drug offences, which was two less than the night before.</p>
      <p>Two schoolies were also issued with liquor infringement notices.</p>
      <p>Police say drugs continue to be the main concern within the party precinct.</p>
      <p>“Police continue to remind school leavers that the possession and consumption of dangerous drugs is illegal and could have fatal consequences.” police said.</p>
      <p>Night three continues on Monday.</p>
