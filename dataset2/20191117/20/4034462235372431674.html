      <h1>Is The Ford Bronco Going To Europe?</h1>
      <h2>A trademark application suggests it might.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:45:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>When Ford showed its product roadmap earlier in the year, there was no mention of the upcoming <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/bronco">Ford Bronco </a>crossing the Atlantic to European shores. Truthfully, we hadn't even considered it, but Ford has promised the Bronco will be an off-road champion of an SUV, and Europeans do like their off-roading SUVs. After all, the Brits practically invented the comfortable off-roader segment with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/land-rover/range-rover">Range Rover</a>.</p>
      <p>That could be a reality as, although Ford has made no mention of it, <a href="http://fordauthority.com/2019/11/ford-bronco-trademark-application-filed-in-europe/">Ford Authority</a> has discovered a trademark application with the European Union Intellectual Property Office with the Bronco name on it.</p>

      <p>Ford</p>
      <p>The application was filed on October 31 of this year and assigns it to "land motor vehicles, namely, passenger automobiles, pick-up trucks, and sport utility vehicles." We know that the new Bronco will debut in the spring of 2020, but we have no official launch date, and now we have the possibility it could be a global launch.</p>
      <p>That makes sense as the Bronco is Ford's most anticipated launch in quite some time, and it would make sense to build it on a global platform. Europe already has versions of Ford's most likely engines for the Bronco, so meeting European emissions regulations should be relatively straightforward.</p>

      <p>The Bronco name does also have nameplate recognition in Europe through movies, TV shows, video games, and books. While not as globally iconic as the Mustang name, it still packs a punch.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/what-is-this-mysterious-ford-bronco-prototype-hiding">we've seen plenty of spy photos</a> and a preview of the Bronco R racing truck that will be tackling parts of this year's Baja 1000, we still have little actual detail. We know it will come in two and four-door body styles, and there will be a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/baby-ford-bronco-leaked-before-youre-supposed-to-see-it">smaller variant called the Bronco Sport</a>. However, we'll have to wait for the unveiling for more details.</p>
