        <b>30-year-old UFC fighter Davy Gallon faced off against 35-year-old English MMA veteran Ross Pearson in Brentwood, Essex on Saturday, with Pearson coming out of retirement specifically to take on the Frenchman.</b>
      </p>
      <p>MMA star and British former lightweight division ultimate fighting champion Ross Pearson saw his hopes for a comeback dashed on Saturday after Davy Gallon knocked him out in spectacular fashion with a heel kick to the face during the third round of their fight at Probellum 1.</p>

      <p>The move, called the “rolling thunder,” caught Pearson off-guard, with the ninja-style kick leaving the event’s commentators shocked, with one simply commenting “Oh s***!” and a second screaming at the top of his lungs “Goodness me! I don’t even know what to call that!”</p>

      <p>Users described the kick as like a finishing move out of <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceyBeach/status/1195965259414200322">Mortal Kombat</a>, with some pondering if it was the <a href="https://twitter.com/MMANerd2/status/1195855759126532096">“best finish in Probellum history,”</a> with others suggesting that perhaps Pearson would have been better off if he had <a href="https://twitter.com/Mark_Buckley_/status/1195859548155916288">“stayed retired.”</a></p>
      <p>Even Pearson’s fans had to give it up to Gallon, saying it was “the KO of the year for sure.”</p>
