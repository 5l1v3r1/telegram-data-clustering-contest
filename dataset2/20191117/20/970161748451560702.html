      <p>Ant and Dec are returning to our screens tonight <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-time-every-night-11168259/">as the 2019 series of </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-time-every-night-11168259/"> kicks off.</a></p>
      <p>The pair are reunited on the show this year after Ant took a year off in 2018 to focus on his health <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/08/ant-mcpartlin-back-road-takes-bike-ride-year-driving-ban-9132858/">following his drink driving conviction</a> and prescription drugs battle – leaving Holly Willoughby to step in and co-host alongside Dec.</p>
      <p>They’ve already been back together fronting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/britains-got-talent/">Britain’s Got Talent</a> back in the spring, and it’s not too long before they’ll also be bringing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saturday-night-takeaway/">Saturday Night Takeaway</a> back to the screen after a two-year break.</p>
      <p>But just when will that show be returning, following its year off?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>When is Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway coming back to TV?</h3>
      <p>It seems like ages since we last saw Saturday Night Takeaway on our tellies, but the good news is we don’t have to wait too much longer for its return.</p>

      <p>That’s because it’s been confirmed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/03/ant-mcpartlin-returning-to-saturday-night-takeaway-alongside-dec-donnelly-after-two-years-away-10514468/">that the show will be back in 2020.</a></p>

      <p>So we’re keeping everything crossed that the new series will follow the same pattern – meaning it’s only a matter of months before it comes back.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec recently confirmed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/12/ant-dec-first-saturday-night-takeaway-meeting-quashing-axe-rumours-10729745/">work had begun on the new series of the show,</a> sharing a snap from the first production meeting as they said: ‘First meeting for Saturday Night Takeaway 2020…exciting times!’ along with details of how viewers can get involved.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a real buzz around the show,’ a source teased about the show’s return back in August. ‘It promises to be bigger and better than ever.’</p>
