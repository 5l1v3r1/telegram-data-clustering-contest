      <p>Suspected migrant herdsmen have killed six hunters in a farming community in Song Local Government Area of Adamawa State.</p>
      <p>Local sources said the gunmen arrived the community,  Aljannaru, in a night raid, destroying farms, shooting at people, and getting the six hunters killed.</p>
      <p>The sources said they suspected the attackers to be members of the Boko Haram sect who have been troubling much of the Northeast.</p>
      <p>However, the Adamawa State Command which confirmed the killing of the six hunters, was definite that the attackers were herdsmen.</p>
      <p>Speaking to our correspondent Sunday night, the Command Spokesman, Sulaiman Nguroje, said the killing of the six was preceded with the invasion of the farm of a hunter by the herdsmen.</p>
      <p>Nguroje said the hunter whose farm was invaded was a resident of Gombi Local Government Area who had a farm in Aljannaru.</p>

      <p>He explained, “Two days ago, he visited his farm to make some harvest. Unfortunately, there were these Fulani migrant herdsmen who were riding horses and camels and were moving with their cows. They invaded his farm and he reacted by calling his colleagues for help.</p>
      <p>“He invited his colleagues from Gombi to join him to prevent the herdsmen from causing mischief in his farm.</p>
      <p>“It was in the evening of Saturday when the hunters were not seen, that their people reported to the police and the police, joined by hunters and some vigilantes, mobilised and entered the area.</p>
      <p>“They found the corpses at a certain remote side of Aljannaru, very close to Zumo Hill.”</p>
      <p>The police spokesman said the state police command has mobilised its operatives, other sister security agents, including the military, as well as hunters, to  comb the bush and get the herdsmen arrested.</p>
