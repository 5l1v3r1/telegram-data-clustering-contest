      <h1>Ian Wright was held at gunpoint after road rage row on team night out</h1>
      <h2>The former Arsenal striker has been announced as one of the contestants on ITV's I'm A Celebrity, which starts on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:28:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p><i>I'm A Celebrity</i> contestant Ian Wright once had a near-death experience after coming face-to-face with a gunman at the end of a Christmas night out at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>Wright, who was recently announced as one of the stars to take part in this year's edition of the popular ITV show, played for the Eagles between 1985-1991, and had a lucky escape when he was confronted with a firearm after driving home from a Christmas party.</p>
      <p>Mark Bright, his strike partner at the time, told the tale in his autobiography <i>Mark Bright: My Story:</i></p>
      <p>"Before Christmas, the players got the chance to relax at a party thrown by Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic company, who were sponsoring our shirts.</p>

      <p>"Mitchell Thomas, who was playing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and was a big friend of Ian Wright, came along as well.</p>
      <p>"He volunteered to be the driver with Ian, Geoff Thomas and me as the passengers.</p>
      <p>"It was late as we drove back through pretty deserted streets to my flat.</p>
      <p>"At some traffic lights we pulled up alongside a car and we could see a man and a woman having some kind of argument.</p>
      <p>"The guy in the other car suddenly looked across and wound his window down. 'What are you looking at?' he shouted at us.</p>
      <p>"This was a red rag to a bull for Wrighty. 'What you looking at then?' Ian screamed back at him and, just for good measure, as we pulled away he stuck a finger up at the guy.</p>

      <p>"We were still in high spirits, but the laughter soon disappeared when I spotted the other guy was obviously following us.</p>
      <p>"Wrighty wasn’t impressed. 'Mitch, pull over,' he said. 'What’s he going to do? There’s four of us.'</p>
      <p>"Mitchell dutifully pulled over so the three passengers could get out to confront the guy.</p>
      <p>"What are you going to do about it?' Wrighty smirked, but the guy didn’t blink.</p>
      <p>"He bent down behind the door of his car, pulled out a gun and pointed the thing straight at us.</p>
      <p>"'I’m going to count to five,' said our friend with the gun. 'And if you lot don’t get in your car and f off, I’m going to start shooting. One... two...'</p>

      <p>"We were all in shock as poor old Mitch drove as fast as he could to my flat. The bloke must have been a maniac to do what he did, and we all knew maniacs don’t operate in the same way that normal people do.</p>
      <p>"When we got to my flat, we virtually fell out of the car because we were desperate to get inside.</p>
      <p>"The reality was, we s*** our pants."</p>
