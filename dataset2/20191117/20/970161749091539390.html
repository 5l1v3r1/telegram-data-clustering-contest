        <b>Kevin Hart showed his fans the strenuous workout routine he has to do to help get fighting fit after his terrifying car crash in September.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The comedian posted an Instagram video of all the sets and exercises he has to complete in order to make sure his back and legs are back to their healthy state.</p>
      <p>He captioned the clip: ‘Rebuilding people….I’m not trying to get back to where I was…I’m trying to reach new levels of greatness….not for you guys tho…I’m trying to reach these new levels for MYSELF.</p>
      <p>‘I want to inspire &amp; motivate people to challenge themselves to be great. We all have greatness within…it’s up to us to tap into it. Nobody knows what your are capable of more than YOU.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t wait to show ME the new levels that we are about to reach!!!! A positive mindset &amp; positive outlook on life are all you need…….you just have to look for it. It’s a lifestyle…. @getvitahustle #LiveLoveLaugh #HustleHart’</p>

      <p>The actor, 40, recently explained that his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/kevin-hart-says-horror-crash-made-different-version-left-unable-move-11089005/">life changing in a matter of seconds gave him a new perspective</a> after seeing how quickly things could end.</p>
      <p>He said on his first Sirius XM Laugh Out Loud show since the accident: ‘For me, I’m a different version of myself. This ain’t got nothing to do about going to church… It’s not spiritual, spiritual is the wrong word.</p>
      <p>‘You’re more present. More aware… It’s all a joke until you get smacked with that real life reality.’</p>
      <p>Kevin was forced to undergo emergency surgery on his back with a gruelling recovery over several weeks.</p>
      <p>He admitted that it was ‘humbling’ to be left so vulnerable, especially when he needed the help of his wife, Eniko Hart, while going to the toilet.</p>
      <p>Kevin explained: ‘I could not f***ing move. I could not wipe my a**… I literally I couldn’t do none of that.</p>
      <p>‘It makes you realise… you really are helpless. There was nothing I could do.’</p>
