        <b>Seven Worlds, One Planet has become the gift that keeps on giving as viewers got to see some very snowy kangaroos and wombats.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tonight’s episode had David Attenborough commentate on the lives of little wombats as they pitter-pattered their way through the snow with their tiny feet.</p>
      <p>Yes, apparently it snows in Australia, the land of poisonous everything.</p>
      <p>The Great Dividing Range is 2,000 metres above the country’s jungles so it’s no surprise it gets a little chilly.</p>
      <p>All we know is that kangaroos look a little less threatening when covered in snow and wombats look 100 times cuter.</p>
      <p>On the bright side, baby kangaroos get to stay warm all year round as they relax in the mum’s pouch while she does all the cold, hard work.</p>
      <p>Wombats aren’t as lucky.</p>

      <p>Speaking on wombats and how their stubby legs are a little too short for inches of snow, David said: ‘He usually shelters underground in a borrow, but now that is under a metre of snow.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘…Show weighs as much as a big dog, and has the legs of a small one.’</p>
      <p>Who knew we all needed clips of wombats trudging through the cold as they tried not to disappear underneath the layers.</p>
      <p>Fans were excited to witness such an adorable scene after watching crocodiles and bats.</p>

      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘Wombats are quite chunky yet don’t eat much. Relatable.’</p>
      <p>‘Wombat in the snow!! Who knew???!’ another commented.</p>

      <p>However, most just found the chunky animal to be be extremely relatable.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted out: ‘”Big dog weight on little dog legs” I feel you Wombat sister.’</p>
      <p>The latest edition of the series covered the most ground yet (it is Australia, after all) – with the hundreds of creatures of the massive continent getting touched on in the new addition.</p>
      <p>Viewers went from ‘ew, gross’ to ‘aw, adorable’ to ‘what on earth is that?’ within minutes thanks to the country’s endless unusual animals.</p>
      <p>Weird and wonderful creatures inhabit the country, which was mostly left alone for thousands of years before humans inhabited it, so it’s no surprise there are endless creatures we know nothing about.</p>
