      <p>The evening was hosted by Clyde 1 breakfast favourites George Bowie and Cassi Gillespie.</p>
      <p>The pair were joined by a number of music acts who helped warm up the crowd.</p>
      <p>And the switch on was brought to a thundering close with a huge fireworks show after the lights were turned on.</p>
      <p>An incredible video shared by Glasgow Loves Christmas on social media shows dozens of rockets lighting up the sky over George Square.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: “Christmas in Glasgow has arrived! The Christmas lights in George Square are on!”</p>

      <p>Edinburgh's Christmas lights were also switched on tonight as thousands of revellers <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4965006/edinburgh-christmas-lights-2019-fireworks-old-town/">descended on the Royal Mile</a>.</p>
      <p>We told last week how one of Glasgow's two annual Christmas markets has already opened.</p>
      <p>Punters have been lapping up festive food and drink after the St Enoch Square market opened its doors on November 9.</p>
      <p>But Xmas lovers will have to wait till November 24 before the larger George Square market is in full swing.</p>
      <p>This year's stalls include a wide range of festive and traditional gifts from around the world.</p>
      <p>More than 50 traders from across the globe will be selling artisan products and high quality crafts - perfect for Christmas gifts!</p>
      <p>Street food is available from a variety of vendors, and authentic German bars will serve traditional beers and festive tipples.</p>
