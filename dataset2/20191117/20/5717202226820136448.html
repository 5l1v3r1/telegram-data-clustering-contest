        <b>A number of Arsenal fans have taken to Twitter to suggest Santi Cazorla could still get into Unai Emery’s midfield after he marked his latest appearance for Spain with his first international goal since 2015.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cazorla attracted the attention of the Gunners supporters during the week. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/santi-cazorla-interview-arsenal-fc-news-villarreal-spain-vs-malta-euro-2020-a9202596.html">The 34-year-old told the Independent</a> that he would love to return to North London in the future.</p>

      <p>The comments certainly suggested that Cazorla was making plans for once his playing days come to an end. But it appears that Arsenal supporters may actually want him back sooner.</p>
      <p>Cazorla scored Spain’s second goal in the 7-0 win over Malta this week. The Villarreal man finished off a fantastic move from the home side, guiding his effort towards the bottom corner with an unsurprisingly classy finish.</p>

      <p>After a horrible time with injury, Cazorla now looks set to enjoy the twilight of his career that he deserves. He is back playing regularly and remains a key player for his club. He has scored five goals and contributed four assists in 13 La Liga appearances this season.</p>
      <h3>Possible Arsenal return?</h3>
      <p>So it is no surprise that plenty of Arsenal fans have taken to social media to suggest that they want Cazorla back at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Emery’s men have underperformed this year. And several fans have suggested that he would still be able to hold down a key role in Arsenal’s side if he did return.</p>
      <p>Cazorla may have set his sights on a return once he has retired. But so many Arsenal fans believe that he should be brought back much sooner.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the supporters were saying about Cazorla after his recent comments and his latest goal…</p>
