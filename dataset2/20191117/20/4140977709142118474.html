                <h3>Pitch Conditions and Toss</h3>
                <p>The pitch conditions, in general, have been on the slower side and the batters have found it difficult to get the ball going.

                            <h3>SL-ET vs AFGH-ET Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Sri Lanka’s wicket-keeper Minod Bhanuka will be our choice for the wicket-keeper’s slot. He has been a prolific run scorer for the emerging team. He hasn’t looked at his best in the competition so far but will definitely look to finish off the tournament on a high. He was dismissed for 2 in the previous clash but defining the odds, he should come up with a big knock tomorrow.</p>
                            <h3>SL-ET vs AFGH-ET Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Pathum Nissanka, the Sri Lankan batsman will be our first pick from the batsmen lot. He scored a well compiled 40 in the opening clash against Oman and followed it up with a 34 in the previous clash. He is due for a big score.</p>
                            <p>Abdul Malik will be another pick in our team given the form he has been in. He smashed a brilliant 91 in the previous clash against Oman. Bahir Shah is another impressive player in the Afghan team who has looked impressive. He remained unbeaten on 24 in the previous clash as Afghanistan romped past Oman by 9 wickets.</p>
                            <p>Ashen Bandara will be our next pick in this segment. He scored a sensational 51 balls 62 in the match against Oman which included 4 fours and a couple of sixes.</p>
                            <h3>SL-ET vs AFGH-ET Dream11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p>Leg-spinner and skipper Samiullah Shenwari should be an inevitable pick in the team given his experience of playing for the senior team. He hasn’t been at his best in the tournament but on a must-win day a big player like him can just do the job for the Afghans.</p>
                            <p>Charith Aslanka has looked in great touch with the bat and scored a magnificent half-century in the previous clash. He will look to continue his good run in Sri Lanka’s final match of the tournament.</p>
                            <p>Kamindu Menids, the left-handed all-rounder from Sri Lanka will be our last pick in the all-rounder’s department. He has been an impressive customer and a stroke maker per excellence.</p>
                            <h3>SL-ET vs AFGH-ET Dream11 Bowlers</h3>
                            <p>Amila Aposo will be the first pick in the Dream XI especially due to his form in the tournament so far. He has so far bagged 5 wickets for two matches and has been the only bright spot for the Lankans in the tournament.</p>
                            <p>Abdul Wasi will be the 2nd player in this segment. He has done a good job for Afghanistan and has bee among the wickets so far. He bagged a couple in the previous match against Oman and will look to continue his good run.</p>
                            <p>The last but not the least player in our list will be Asitha Fernando. He has impressed with his pace and skills and has also been among the wickets.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Our captain for the day will be Amila Aponso for his knack of taking wickets. Vice-captain for the day will be Adbul Malik.</p>
