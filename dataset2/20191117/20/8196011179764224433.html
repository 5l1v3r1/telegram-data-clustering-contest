      <p>Ciarán Sheehan is back as part of the extended Cork senior football panel for the first time since 2013.</p>
      <p>Sheehan, who started for his club Éire Óg in today’s Munster IFC semi-final loss to Kerry’s Templenoe, will be involved in pre-season, and possibly beyond, with Ronan McCarthy’s Rebels.</p>
      <p>Cork will play Tipperary and Kerry in the pre-season McGrath Cup, though the Kingdom are likely to field a majority of Under 20s because the majority of their senior squad will be on holiday in Thailand.</p>
      <p>Cork’s Allianz FL Division 3 fixtures for 2020 have also been finalised with four of their seven games at home.</p>
      <p>They open with a home game against Offaly at the end of January before ties against Leintrim (A), Down (H), Tipperary (A), Louth (H), Longford (A) and Derry (H).</p>
