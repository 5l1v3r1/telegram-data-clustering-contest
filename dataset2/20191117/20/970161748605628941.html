      <p>This year’s I’m A Celebrity contestants have swapped their lives of luxury for a spot of jungle hardship <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-2019-start-date-time-line-hosts-11167643/">as the new series gets underway on ITV.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/im-celebrity-2019-start-line-11089656/">And this year’s line-up</a> looks distinctly promising, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/caitlyn-jenner-confirmed-im-celebrity-2019-shock-signing-11028866/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and Ian Wright set to rough it in camp along with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">the likes of Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle</a> and Good Morning Britain’s Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>Also joining the 10 campmates is comedian Andrew Maxwell – whose voice might be familiar to you even if his name isn’t.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know about the funnyman…</p>
      <h3>How old is Andrew Maxwell and where is he from?</h3>
      <p>Andrew is 44 years old, and could well celebrate his birthday in the jungle – as he’s due to turn 45 on 3 December.</p>
      <p>He is from Dublin, where he also began his comedy career – having appeared at a local club run by Father Ted’s Ardal O’Hanlon before moving on to the stand-up circuit.</p>

      <p>Andrew has previously worked as the audience warm-up man for TV shows including They Think It’s All Over and Friday Night With Jonathan Ross – although has also been a familiar face in front of the camera.</p>
      <p>He’s been on the likes of Never Mind The Buzzcocks, Mock The Week, Drunk History and Irish TV show The Panel – while as a stand-up he hosts his own regular London show, Fullmooners, and has made frequent appearances at the Edinburgh Festival.</p>

      <p>However others might recognise him as the narrator of MTV series Ex On The Beach – which he has featured in since the show first began in 2014.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his going into the jungle, Andrew has said agreeing to be on the show was an easy decision – even if there is a chance he might miss the General Election.</p>
      <p>He told Heart Radio: ‘I will still vote in the general election but the idea of missing all the guff because I am doing a Bushtucker Trial does tickle me quite a bit!</p>
      <p>‘It was a no brainer when they asked me and I said yes immediately.’</p>
      <h3>Is Andrew Maxwell married?</h3>

      <p>The couple have three children, with Andrew recently revealing that his youngest is just two years old.</p>
