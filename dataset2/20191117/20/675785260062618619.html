      <h2>As Ian Wright heads into the Australian rainforest, we take a look a how other retired footballers have done on the show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T20:29:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ian-wright">Ian Wright</a> heads into the jungle this weekend as he takes part in the 19th series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV's</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here</a> , becoming the latest ex-footballer to compete Down Under.</p>
      <p>Since the show was first broadcast way back in 2002, retired soccer stars have become something of a fixture in the line-up in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/australia">Australia</a> , featuring alongside actors, singers and reality TV favourites.</p>
      <p>By and large, most endeared themselves to the public having entertained millions during the various trials they were voted.</p>
      <p>A few, however, did not last as long in the jungle as they would have liked - a fate ex- <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> forward Wright will be desperately hoping to avoid.</p>
      <h3>Harry Redknapp (Winner, Series 18)</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The former Portsmouth and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss emerged from the jungle as a national treasure after declaring his love for jam roly poly and wife Sandra.</p>
      <p>Redknapp took part in six trials in total and never once missed out on a star, helping campmates including TV presenters Nick Knowles and Noel Edmonds remain well fed.</p>
      <p>The legendary boss topped the public vote every day and was eventually crowned King of the Jungle with 69 per cent of the vote, becoming the first footballer to win the show.</p>
      <h3>Dennis Wise (Sixth, Series 17)</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The ex-Chelsea hard man was a surprise contestant on the show in 2017 having largely stayed out of the limelight since leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> in September 2008.</p>
      <p>During his time in the jungle, Wise came under fire along with other campmates for the perceived bullying of comedian Iain Lee.</p>
      <p>In total, the former Millwall boss took part in two trials on the show and was eventually evicted on day 19 after losing out to boxer Amir Khan.</p>
      <h3>Wayne Bridge (Fifth, Series 16)</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Another former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> star to appear on the show, the ex-England international found himself in the jungle alongside the likes of Countdown legend Carol Vorderman and Gogglebox favourite Scarlett Moffat.</p>
      <p>Bridge came out of his shell the more the series progressed, eventually horrifying singer wife Frankie with revelations about their sex life.</p>
      <p>The full-back left on Day 20 after taking part in six trials during his stint in the rainforest.</p>
      <h3>Kieron Dyer (Fourth, Series 15)</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Went in with the public probably best knowing him for his scrap on the pitch with Newcastle team-mate Lee Bowyer in 2005, but revealed another side to his personality.</p>
      <p>The former West Ham man struck up a friendship with Lady Colin Campbell, the royal biographer and socialite who regular wound up the other campmates with her antics.</p>
      <p>Dyer took part in eight trials during his jungle stint before being voted out the day before the final.</p>
      <h3>Jimmy Bullard (10th, Series 14)</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Another surprise choice given he never played for a so-called 'big club' and never represented his country, but the midfielder became  the camp's chief banter merchant.</p>
      <p>After initially being a hit with the viewing public, the good feeling towards Bullard turned away after it was felt he had taken his mocking of The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> contestant Jake Quickenden too far.</p>
      <p>That may have led to the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc">Fulham</a> man's early exit, with the midfielder first to be voted out on day 17 after five trials.</p>
      <h3>Rodney Marsh (Seventh, Series Seven)</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The ex-Man City attacker went Down Under in 2007, taking part alongside supermodel Janice Dickinson and The Apprentice contestant Katie Hopkins.</p>
      <p>The public voted Marsh in for a trial at the first possible opportunity, hinting that he was not necessarily a favourite with viewers.</p>
      <p>That may have eventually led to his early downfall, with the former QPR man only making it through to day 15 before being sent packing.</p>
      <h3>Neil Ruddock (Eighth, Series Three)</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The man known as Razor was among the favourites to win the show prior to entering the jungle such was his larger-than-life personality.</p>
      <p>The ex-Liverpool defender put himself forward for the first trial with glamour model <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> and showed no fear as they placed their heads in helmets while critters were poured in.</p>
      <p>However, that proved to be Ruddock's only trial before he was the third person to be evicted on day 11, losing out to former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond.</p>
      <h3>John Fashanu (Second, Series Two)</h3>

      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>A trailblazer as the first footballer to take part in the show, his success may be the reason why many more soccer stars have been booked since.</p>
      <p>Fash become a huge hit with the public for the way he calmed himself down during trials, seemingly meditating before giving it a go.</p>
      <p>The ex-Wimbledon striker made it all the way to the final on day 15 before being pipped to the crown by cricketer Phil Tufnell.</p>
