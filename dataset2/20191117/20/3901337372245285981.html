        <b>EURO 2020 Qualifier</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Kosovo 0-4 England <br/><br/><b>Date:</b> 17 November 2019<br/><br/><b>Venue:</b> Stadiumi Fadil Vokrri</p>
      <p>Group A leaders England wrapped up their 2020 European Championship qualifying campaign with a 4-0 win over Kosovo on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate rotated the squad for the clash, with Raheem Sterling returning while Callum Hudson-Odoi was also given a chance to impress in the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>England were initially battling to break the stubborn Kosovo defence and their first clear opening only came in the 15th minute after Sterling was teed up by Harry Kane inside the box but his fierce strike was saved by shot-stopper Arijanet Muric.</p>
      <p>However, after numerous attacks from the visitors, Kosovo finally opened up at the back in the 32nd minute after Harry Winks dribbled his way to go clear inside the box and calmly slot beyond the reach of Muric.</p>
      <p>Bernard Challandes' troops were having a good attacking spell after the hour-mark, with England weathering the storm and they nearly levelled matters 15 minutes before time after Milot Rashica went clear and got past Pop, but his shot was cleared on the line by Declan Rise.</p>
      <p>Kane finally settled the nerves for the Three Lions after making it 2-0 in the last 11 minutes with a volley at the back post after Fidan Aliti made a horrible clearance that landed at the feet of the England skipper.</p>
      <p>Second-half substitute Marcus Rashford bagged the visitors' third goal four minutes later with a first-time finish past Muric after being played in by Sterling.</p>
      <p>Mason Mount rounded off the thrashing in stoppage time with a neat finish into the bottom corner after Kane pounced on a mistake at the back and teed up the Chelsea midfielder.</p>
