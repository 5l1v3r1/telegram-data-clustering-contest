      <p>The three movies shot on the Huawei Mate 30 series we talked about in<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/17/huawei-mate-30-short-films-coming-soon/"> this article</a> aren’t the only great feat achieved by the device in the past couple days. The smartphone was indeed the star of another event: a concert.</p>

      <p>How did it work? Well it’s quite “simple”. A Huawei Mate 30 Pro 5G was set in the main venue in Hubei and the concert was carried out by the Hubei Provincial Museum Bell Orchestra, while the other identical device was in the Shandong Museum where we find the Tianfeng Haitao Guqin from the prosperous Tang Dynasty.</p>
      <p>Then, through a 5G connection, the two parts of the “band” were synced together. This resulted in a full-on real concert experience for the people who attended the event.</p>

      <p>Obviously, the level of synchronization achieved couldn’t have happened without 5G. The next generation cellular network technology has indeed the lowest latency we’ve ever seen on a mobile network; along with the fastest speeds.</p>
      <p>The Huawei Mate 30 Pro 5G, as the name suggests, clearly supports the tech. As a matter of fact, Huawei’s latest flagship is actually the best 5G phone according to China Mobile. The device did indeed win different awards at the internet provider’s conference which <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/16/huawei-mate-30-pro-5g-china-mobile/">took place yesterday</a>.</p>

      <p>Huawei’s Mate 30 Pro 5G also got a five-star evaluation for video quality and a five-star evaluation for the camera department in general. Finally, the device also earned 5 stars for its gaming capabilities.</p>
      <p>Other specs on the Mate 30 Pro 5G include a Huawei Kirin 990 CPU, a 6.53-inch FHD+ display (2400 x 1176), at least 8GB of RAM and 128GB/256GB of internal storage, a nano-SD card slot and four cameras. These include a 40MP ultra wide-angle + 40MP wide-angle + 8MP telephoto + 3D depth sensor. In addition, these sensors support 3x optical zoom, 5x hybrid zoom, and 30x digital zoom. On the front, there is a 32MP selfie shooter which supports 3D face unlock.</p>
