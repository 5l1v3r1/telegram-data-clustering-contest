      <h1>DraftKings Picks Week 11: NFL DFS lineup advice for cash games</h1>

      <p>The Seahawks, Packers, and even the Giants have reliably producedinteresting NFL DFS cash plays over the first 10 weeks, but they join the Titans on bye in Week 11. The Chiefs and Chargers both ditch this slate by playing Monday night, and Matthew Stafford's injury could derail the Lions-Cowboys fantasy bonanza.But we'll make do with our Week 11 DraftKings cash lineup picks.</p>

This week's lineup will spendmore at receiver than in that build, while likewise going with three RBs.</p>

      <h3>DraftKings Week 11 Picks: NFL DFS cash lineup</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Playing under a $50K salary cap for Sunday afternoon ET contests.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>QB Deshaun Watson, Texans @ Ravens ($6,800).</b> I like Watson's floor more than Drew Brees at $6,900, especially afterlast week's meltdown by Brees and the rushing floor of Watson. Watson has averaged 6.8 carries and 40.8 yards over the past five games, including two touchdowns. This also saves $900 offLamar Jackson.</p>
      <p><b>RB Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. Bengals, ($6,900).</b> The featured back ona double-digitfavorite is going sub-$7K. You have my attention. Game script sensitivity can be aworry when it comes toJacobs' usage, but he did see an uptick at five targets in the last outing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 11 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/ob2l6y92sylb1aavyt6fu6evw">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1ink24648r3za1gkam0igv3ff9">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1k2ogltnjx2se1la6u4i3dbbtl">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB Joe Mixon, Bengals @ Raiders ($5,500). </b>Zac Taylor has gone militantly ground-and-poundwith rookie Ryan Finley at quarterback, as Mixon saw 30 carries during the Bengals' rout at the hands of Baltimore. An $800 price bump still gets us $7K-type volume at a much-lowerprice.</p>
      <p><b>WR John Brown, Bills @ Dolphins ($6,400).</b> Miami's actually shown to be feisty enough not to kill opposing pass volume, making Brown's floor-ceiling combo intriguing at mid-tier cost. Brown ranks fifth among receivers in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thomas-emerick-1/very-online-the-podcast-nfl-week-11-dk-cash-preview">air yards</a> and eighth in targets since Week 8.</p>
      <p><b>WR D.J. Moore, Panthers vs. Falcons ($5,900).</b> Moore ranks right behind Brown in air yards over the past three weeks, and hetrails only Mike Evans in targets over that span among receivers on thisDK mainslate.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>WR Calvin Ridley, Falcons @ Panthers ($5,500).</b> As with last week's Darius Slayton play, we're counting on target displacement helping Ridley here. Mohamed Sanu's market share nearly equaled Ridley's when dealt, and since then he'sseen Matt Schaub at QB orpositive game script as in Week 10. An Austin Hooper absence would only bolster the target projection.</p>
      <p><b>TE Zach Ertz, Eagles vs. Patriots ($5,000).</b> The Pats aren't a funnel-TE defense, but their top DK ranking against WRshows thisdefense incentivizes alternative ways to target pass-catchers. Philly made a point of pulling the focal point of their pass offense back toward Ertz with 11 targets last outing.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>FLEX Brian Hill</b> <b>, Falcons @ Panthers ($4,800).</b> Monitor Devonta Freeman's foot sprain, as he ceded nearly all the backfield work to Brian Hill after exiting. Carolina also allows the fourth-most DK points torunning backs.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>D/ST Saints @ Buccaneers ($2,900).</b> We ran Cardinals at $2,200 last week to collect on any Jameis Winston sacks or turnovers, to the tune of 5x value. The $700 price bump from a lower-end defense to one of the league's very best just seems modest.</p>
