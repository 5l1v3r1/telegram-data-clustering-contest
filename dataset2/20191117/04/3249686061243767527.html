      <p><b>SS501</b>'s <b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kim-kyu-jong">Kim Kyu Jong</a></b> has broken up with his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>He had admitted to a relationship with his Japanese girlfriend in July earlier this year, but now it's been revealed that he had broken up with her recently.</p>
      <p>Back in July, his relationship was revealed when he accidentally posted a photo of themselves as a couple on his SNS. The situation had become an issue because of worsening Korea-Japan relations at the time. </p>
      <p>Best of luck to both of them.</p>
