      <h1>Week 11 Fantasy QB Rankings: Drew Brees, Philip Rivers remain high despite last week's duds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:24:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:24</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Week 11 provides some interesting matchup-talent contrasts in our fantasy QB rankings. On one side, we haveCarson Wentz against the ferocious Patriots defense, which just had a bye but was proven to be human by Lamar Jackson. On the other, we have Kyle Allen, who looked decent against Green Bay in the snow, is definitely less talented than Wentz, but also faces a brutal Atlanta pass defense (except the Falcons just held Drew Brees in check). You could make an argument for both of those players assleepers or busts this week. It's just a matter of perspective.</p>
      <p>The same is true with Baker Mayfield (vs. Steelers) versus Ryan Finley (@ Raiders). Mayfield led a solid Browns' outing against the Bills, winning a game many expected Cleveland to lose. Mayfield didn't make any brutal mistakes, although Freddie Kitchens couldn't call a play to score on goal-to-go if his life depended on it. Finley had some rough patches in his NFL debut but also displayed the arm talent we knew he had,and he gets to face Oakland, another terrible pass defense, in Week 11.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In the end, Wentz and Mayfield win out in our rankings, but barely. In a given week, most quarterbacks will accumulate a passing level of fantasy points, no pun intended. We're looking for the two-to-six point difference that can matter in the outcome of our fantasy matchups. Maybe that's an extra touchdown, one fewer interception, or 75 more yards. And in the interests of that, we still have to bet on the much superior talent of Wentz and Mayfield despite the tougher opponents.</p>

      <p>Most fantasy owners probably have a better option than that duo, though. Our top 15 is overloaded with solid QBs with neutral or better matchups. There's the return of Nick Foles as Jacksonville's quarterback against the Colts. Josh Allen faces Miami. Sam Darnold gets the Redskins, while Jimmy Garoppolo gets the Cardinals. And of course the usual young studs and future Hall-of-Famers figure into that mix, too.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ideally, the decision you have to make this week is not Wentz versus Finley, but Wentz versus Darnold. In that case, you can rely on the better matchup to rule the daybecause the talent discrepancy might not be as high. But we'd also understand if you decide to go with the player you consider your QB1-- just realize that there's some definite downside to those tough matchups, a downside that may not exist for the better matchups.</p>
