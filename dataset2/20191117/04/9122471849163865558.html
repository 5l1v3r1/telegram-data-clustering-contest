      <h1>Dabo Swinney Had A Message For Clemson’s Critics On Saturday Night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:11:20+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>It seems impossible for a defending national champion to have a quiet undefeated season, but that’s where Clemson is right now. The No. 3 Tigers kept things rolling today, with a 52-3 massacre of Wake Forest, which has been one of the better non-Clemson teams in the weak ACC this fall. Dabo Swinney is doing his part to make sure people know how good this team is.</p>
      <p>Clemson definitely didn’t look like itself early in the year. A 21-20 near-loss at UNC is the game most point to, but even in big wins against Georgia Tech, Texas A&amp;M, and Syracuse through September, the team didn’t look like the same one that blew out Alabama in the national title.</p>
      <p>Since that North Carolina escape, Clemson has been locked in. After tonight, the Tigers are 11-0, with an average margin of victory of over 42.</p>
      <p>The Tigers have scored at least 52 points in each of their last four games.</p>
      <p>If Clemson wins out, it shouldn’t have any issue reaching the Playoff, even with a weak schedule. Still, Dabo Swinney has taken to pumping up his team.</p>
      <p>After the game, the proud head coach said that the offense is ahead of where it was last year, and that this is the most consistent team he’s ever had. from <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/clemson-dabo-swinney-offense-way-ahead-from-a-year-ago-trevor-lawrence--138735469/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I haven’t had a team that has played like this (before), this consistent,” Swinney said. “We are way ahead offensively right now at this time than it was last year and it’s really not even close … people spending a lot of time saying we don’t play anybody, they don’t really pay a lot of attention to how we play.”<br/><br/>[…]<br/><br/>“I don’t know what else we can do on the field,” Swinney told reporters the week of the first playoff rankings. “Best offensive production we’ve ever had. Ever. Ever. So I don’t know what else we can do. In fact college defense, ain’t had but two other teams in the last 20 years that have held nine opponents to less than 300 yards to start the season. So if it’s about what else is on the field, I don’t know what we can do.”</blockquote>
      <p>He’s not alone. Earlier today, <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/clemson-tigers/kirk-herbstreit-makes-bold-claim-about-clemson">Kirk Herbstreit said</a> he thinks this year’s Clemson team may be better than last year’s national championship one.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, if Clemson wins out, it shouldn’t have any issues, and while the Tigers may be a bit miffed that they aren’t really in consideration for the top seed right now, you’re going to have to beat two really good teams on neutral fields, no matter which of the four spots you land in.</p>
