      <p>BROCKPORT – The perfect ending to the centennial season of Lancaster football would have been a picturesque moment in which players, coaches and fans shed tears of joy while celebrating the program’s first state championship two weeks from now at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse.</p>
      <p>Instead, the Legends walked into their postgame huddle and then out of frigid Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium in tears trying to console each other after suffering a painful season-ending defeat.</p>
      <p>Lancaster did everything it could to try to upset unbeaten Section V champion and private school McQuaid during Saturday night’s Class AA Far West Regional contest. The Legends committed just enough mistakes, though, to let a winnable game slip through their fingers, as the Knights rallied from a 13-point deficit to defeat Lancaster, 32-28.</p>
      <p>McQuaid, which won its first sectional championship since 1978, scored the game’s final 15 points to pull off its second come-from-behind victory in as many weeks. The Knights trailed by 14 last week before rallying for a 30-27 win over Aquinas, ending the latter’s state championship reign.</p>
      <p>Now, McQuaid finds itself one win away from being able to compete for the state title, while the Legends think about what might have been.</p>
      <p>“From the start of the week we came into the game knowing we were going to win,” senior linebacker and third-year starter Conor Mahony said. “We just came up short. … We left it all out there.”</p>
      <p>Senior Shawn Davis scored three touchdowns, including a 56-yard punt return. That special-teams score and ensuing tow-point conversion catch pushed Lancaster's lead to 28-17 with 6 minutes, 6 seconds left in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Davis (seven receptions, 92 yards) also caught TDs of 38 an 25 yards from junior quarterback Jason Mansell. Mansell passed for 200 yards and three touchdowns but committed four turnovers (two interceptions and two lost fumbles), two that happened deep in Knights territory.</p>
      <p>The last lost fumble ended a Legends march that seemed destined to reach the end zone, except Mansell got hit at the end of a run that gained a first down with the ball popping in the air and into the hands of Quinn Bergeron.</p>
      <p>McQuaid (11-0) turned that takeaway into the drive that produced the go-ahead touchdown: Andrew Passero’s 9-yard run on a fourth-and-inches play with 5:34 left.</p>
      <p>Passero earned MVP honors as he caught six passes for 108 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 66 yards and a TD. Whenever the Knights needed a big play to get a first down or score, he delivered.</p>
      <p>Lancaster struck first as Mansell hooked up with Davis on a 38-yard pass play with just more than 4 minutes left in the first quarter. The lead didn’t last long as Casey Howlett returned the kickoff 82 yards for the touchdown.</p>
      <p>The Legends scored the next 13 points, taking to the air. Mansell made a nice throw to corner of the end zone, and Dominic Fulciniti made an even better catch – somehow getting a foot down before being pushed out of bounds to make it 13-7 with 52.6 seconds left in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>Mansell and Davis hooked up again on a 25-yard post with 3:25 left in the second quarter. The Knights scored with 1:58 left in the half as Passero reached the end zone on a 19-yard catch-and-run off a screen.</p>
      <p>McQuaid pulled within 20-17 early in the third quarter on a 25-yard field goal by Jordan Brongo after a line-drive onside kick bounced off a Lancaster leg and back to a Knights player to start the second half.</p>
      <p>Davis scored his third TD via the punt return. McQuaid responded with a long drive with a 12-play, 80-yard drive that Cairns capped with a 1-yard sneak with 1:25 left in the third.</p>

      <p>Lancaster seemed poised to make it a two-score game, again -- driving down to McQuaid’s 16. However, Mansell got stripped of the ball after gaining 5 yards for a first down. The Knights then marched 85 yards to take the lead for good.</p>
      <p>“We just didn’t get the bounces,” Lancaster coach Eric Rupp said. “The opening kickoff goes off a kid’s leg, pops straight up in the air and they recover it. Then we were driving late in the game, Jason gets hit and the ball pops up and lands right in their arms. Football is a funny game sometimes.”</p>
      <p>It is, considering the Legends won last week despite committing four turnovers.</p>
      <p>Lancaster’s final possession with significant time left went backward as two sacks and an incomplete pass resulted in a punt. But the defense couldn’t get off the field as the Knights milked the final five minutes.</p>
      <p>McQuaid returns to action Saturday at Cicero-North Syracuse, where it will face the Section III champions on their home field in a New York State Public High School Athletic Association semifinal.</p>
      <p>The Legends finish 8-3 – losing their three games by a grand total of six points.</p>
      <p>Winning it all would have been nice. But the 100<sup>th</sup> season of Lancaster football still ended up with a championship celebration.</p>
      <p>“These (28) seniors have gone 37-3 against Section VI and won four Section VI championships,” Rupp said. “I can’t thank them enough for what they’ve done for our program and our community.”</p>
      <p>“The state (runner-up) season is one memory I’ll have, but this is my top one,” Mahony said. “Everyone saw us as the team that was going to drop back and we proved them wrong. … We proved them wrong by winning the section.”</p>
