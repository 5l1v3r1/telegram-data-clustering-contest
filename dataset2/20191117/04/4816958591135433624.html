      <h1>No. 7 Utah makes statement with rout of UCLA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:36:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:36</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Tyler Huntley passed for two touchdowns and rushed for a third, Zack Moss ran for two scores, and No. 7-ranked Utah routed UCLA, 49-3, Saturday at Rice-Eccles Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Utes (9-1, 6-1 Pac-12 Conference) surrendered a field goal on UCLA’s game-opening possession. They proceeded to score the game’s next 49 points, beginning on the next drive when Huntley ran for a 2-yard touchdown.</p>
      <p>UCLA (4-6, 4-3) moved the ball into Utah territory for a third time in the early going, following the initial 43-yard J.J. Molson field goal and a 42-yard miss. Trailing 14-3 after a 4-yard Moss touchdown rush, the Bruins had an opportunity to pull back within single digits.</p>
      <p>However, UCLA quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson coughed up a fumble that Utah’s Mika Tafua returned 68 yards for a touchdown. The scoring swing kicked off the blowout in earnest.</p>
      <p>Utah forced two more turnovers on the night with interceptions by Julian Blackmon and Pita Tonga.</p>
      <p>Moss, meanwhile, gained 38 of his 127 rushing yards on his second end-zone run just before halftime. The Utes continued the deluge on the first play of the second half when Huntley threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to Brant Kuithe.</p>
      <p>Huntley tacked on another 83 yards with his second touchdown pass, hooking up with Samson Nacua. Huntley went 14-of-18 for 335 yards. Kuithe accounted for 132 of them on five catches.</p>
      <p>Joshua Kelley rushed for 78 yards for UCLA. Thompson-Robinson went 20-of-36 passing for 219 yards.</p>
      <p>Devonta’e Henry-Cole capped the night’s scoring with a 27-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. The 46-point romp made a statement for Utah, which sits within striking distance of the top four of the College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>The loss eliminates UCLA from contention for the Pac-12 South divisional title. Utah advances to the Dec. 6 conference championship game if it wins out in games against Arizona and Colorado, or with one win and a USC loss.</p>
