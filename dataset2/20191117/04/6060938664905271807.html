      <h1>The Internet can’t deal with viral singer Ranu Mondal’s latest ‘makeup’ photos</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:05:34+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Viral singing sensation Ranu Mondal’s rags to riches story was nothing short of inspiring. With a captivating voice, she became an overnight star and gained immense popularity and millions of YouTube hits for her talent.</p>
      <p>From bagging recording deals to appearing on a host of reality shows, and now even attending various public events, Ranu is living it up like a star. Interestingly, Ranu seemed to have had a makeover of sorts while she made her latest appearance at an event. Ditching the usual saree for a glamorous lehenga and even wearing makeup that was a couple of tones lighter than her natural skin colour, Mondal left netizens shocked.</p>
      <p>Her photos immediately flooded social media sites, all thanks to trolls who had a field day poking fun at her makeup look. While some took mean jibes and compared her to ‘The Nun’, others came to her defence and slammed trolls for their hurtful posts.</p>
