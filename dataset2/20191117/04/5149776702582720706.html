      <p>Brennan Johnson’s long-term international future may yet to be decided, but the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> youngster has just one thought on his mind - and that's making his family proud.</p>
      <p>Having been watched by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/no-surprise-england-monitoring-nottingham-3307717">England boss Gareth Southgate</a> recently after making a positive impact on the first team scene at the City Ground this term, the 18-year-old currently plies his trade for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/brennan-johnson-scores-wales-under-3293863">Wales’ Under-21 side</a> , though until he earns a senior cap, the Three Lions could still tempt him their way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/forget-messi-ronaldo-brennan-johnson-2740998">Johnson</a> is currently away on international duty with the Welsh side ahead of Tuesday’s qualifier with Bosnia in Wrexham, and for now, all talk of what may happen in the future is off the agenda.</p>
      <p>"I did play for England, but I can't fault Wales," the highly-rated Forest youngster told BBC Sport Wales, having represented the Three Lions at Under-16 and Under-17 level.</p>

      <h3>ANNIVERSARY OF PIERRE VAN HOOIJDONK'S RETURN</h3>

      <p>Ex-Nottingham Forest midfielder Andy Johnson says he and his teammates sympathised with Pierre van Hooijdonk's decision to go on strike while at the City Ground, but did not commend his actions.</p>
      <p>The striker famously refused to return to pre-season training after seeing a number of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> 's high-profile stars leave during the summer, including his attacking sidekick Kevin Campbell.</p>
      <p>Once the club's record signing, van Hooijdonk was crowned Reds player of the year in 1998 but after forcing his exit never played in England again and instead flourished in his native Holland</p>
      <p>There he would win the golden boot in both the Eredivise and the UEFA cup as well as being named Dutch footballer of the year.</p>

      <p>Bolton have wiped out their points deduction after former <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> striker Daryl Murphy's stoppage-time winner saw off 10-man MK Dons 1-0.</p>
      <p>The victory made it a third straight win for Wanderers - who started the campaign on -12 points after going into administration - and moved them on to one point for the campaign, 12 points from safety.</p>
      <p>MK Dons appeared to have done enough to stop their three-match losing run when goalkeeper Lee Nicholls saved Murphy's 90th-minute penalty.</p>
      <p>But three minutes into added time, Murphy turned in Thibaud Verlinden's cross to take Wanderers from negative numbers into the black.</p>

      <p>The plans - which were initially unveiled earlier this year - are set to see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of about 10,000 supporters.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated planning application for the project will be submitted before the end of this year, and should permission be granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>According to lead architect and CEO of Benoy Tom Cartledge, plenty of work has been going on behind the scenes since the initial announcement in March.</p>
