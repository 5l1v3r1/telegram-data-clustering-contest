      <h1>Week 11 DraftKings Picks: Best lineup stacks for NFL DFS tournaments, cash games</h1>

      <p>There have been some difficult slates to handicap this season, but Week 11 may be the toughest to find stacks. At the very top, we have two players in Christian McCaffrey and Michael Thomas, who are priced up nearly as high as we have ever seen players at their positions. We also have two very obvious value running backs in Brian Hill and J.D. McKissic, who open up a ton a salary to afford the high-end players. There are also five games that have a current total of 48-points or higher, so narrowing down the stacking options is not as straightforward as it has been in previous weeks. Expect the Saints (at Tampa), Panthers (vs. Atlanta), and both sides of the Texans-Ravens game to garner the most attention, but don't overlook other teams with high team totals such as the Bucs, Raiders, Cowboys, and Falcons.</p>

      <h3>Week 11 NFL DFS Picks: Top DraftKings stacks for cash games     </h3>
      <p><b>QB Kyle Allen and RB Christian McCaffrey, Carolina Panthers </b><br/><br/>I'm making McCaffrey my top priority in cash games this week on both DraftKings and FanDuel, and it just so happens that pairing him with quarterback Kyle Allen not only offers some nice correlation given McCaffrey's pass-catching ability, but also provides your lineup with some much needed salary relief at the quarterback position.<br/><br/>Allen is coming off his first career 300-yard passing game last week in the snow against Green Bay, and he will face an Atlanta defense that before last weekhad been one of the worst passing defenses in the league. I don't see Allen as a huge upside play, but his appeal comes down the nice floor that he should have in this matchup at his price point.<br/><br/>As for CMC, he is expensive yet again this week, but I'm more than willing to pay the $10,500 price tag to lock in 25-plusfantasy points in a cash game lineup. McCaffrey has exceeded 25 touches in all but two games this season, and there aren't many situations that would see him get under that number with Carolina entering this game as 5.5-point home favorites in a game with a 50.5 point total.</p>

Winston has been remarkably consistent from a fantasy point of view this season, having thrown for more than 300 yards and at least one touchdown in each of his last four games. He is also flashing some sneaky athleticism on the ground in an attempt to limit his turnovers with 13 rushes for 101 yards over his previous three games.<br/><br/>The matchup against the Saints isn't easy given the considerable D-Line/O-Line mismatch that they present to the Bucs offense. Still, this game will be played in Tampa, and with Tampa entering this game as 6.5-point home underdogs, we can expect Winston to be forced to throw upwards of 40 times in this game - only boosting his median projection.<br/><br/>I like both Evans and Godwin this week as stacking options with Winston, and this pick of Evans is reliant on the status of Saints' cornerback Marshon Lattimore, who is dealing with a calf injury. If Lattimore sits, then this could be an explosion day for Evans on the outside. If Lattimore ends up playing, then I like going to Godwin at a slightly cheaper price point.</p>

      <h3>Week 11 DraftKings Picks: Best stacks for daily fantasy football GPPs/tournaments</h3>
      <p><b>QB Deshaun Watson and WR Will Fuller, Houston Texans  (<i>UPDATE: Fuller has been ruled out, making Kenny Stills the better and cheaper stacking partner.)</i></b><br/><br/>I really want to get exposure to the Texans-Ravens matchupand its 49.5-point total. The Ravens' side of the ball is tough to stack, given how much of the offensive production goes to solely Lamar Jackson, but the Texans' side has some interesting options to pair withWatson.<br/><br/>DeAndre Hopkins is the obvious safe play, but at $8,100 on DraftKings, fitting a Watson/Hopkins stack withChristian McCaffrey is going to be a tough proposition. The more fun stack in from the Texans side of the ball is Watson and Fuller, who looks set to return to the lineup in his first game since injuring his hamstring in Week 7. Fuller's price point is very appealing across the industry, and I doubt that his ownership gets above 10 percentin large field GPPs given his long absence and high risk of injury. In my opinion, the risk is worth Fuller's massive upside in this spot, and you won't have to play more than 20 percentof him to double the field's exposure.<br/><br/><b>QB Drew Brees, WR Michael Thomas, and WR Ted Ginn Jr., New Orleans Saints </b><br/><br/>It would be great to pay up for the Saints passing game in cash games this week, but they are priced up extremely high due to the prime matchup against the Bucs. Michael Thomas is an eye-watering $9,900 on DraftKings - the most expensive a wide receiver has been since Antonio Brown in 2016. However, it's hard to argue that Thomas isn't worthy of this massive price bump given the fact that he leads the NFL in receiving yards and is on pace to break the single-season record for receptions in a season. The price point alone is going to drive down his ownership in tournaments, especially in a week where Christian McCaffrey, Dalvin Cook, and Ezekiel Elliott are all in great spots.<br/><br/>If Brees is going to score 30-plusfantasy points, then he is likely going to need to throw four touchdowns, which means a Saints double passing stack makes sense here. TE Jared Cook is a viable option, but I want some better point-per-dollar upside. This leads me onto Ginn at $4,100. Ginn is, of course, a boom-or-bust play, but he is the best vertical threat on the Saints, and we've seen Tampa get destroyed all year long by vertical passing plays. Look no further than what Christian Kirk did to them last week on the outside.<br/><br/><i>There's plenty of strategy that goes into putting together a winning DFS lineup, and the best place to start is <a href="https://try.rotoql.com/sportingnews/">RotoQL’s DFS tools</a> . <a href="https://try.rotoql.com/sportingnews/">RotoQL's Lineup Optimizer</a> is a massive advantage when you're building lineups, regardless of contest size or site.</i></p>
