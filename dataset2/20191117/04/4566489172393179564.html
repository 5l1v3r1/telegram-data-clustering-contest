      <p>Thousands of Greeks took part in demonstrations Sunday to mark the anniversary of a 1973 anti-junta uprising, with police bracing for trouble after a series of raids on anarchists.</p>
      <p>This year the protest was heavily influenced by opposition to the new conservative government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, elected in July on a pledge to strengthen law and order.</p>
      <p>"Down with the right-wing government" read a banner carried by the protesters. "Uprisings do not end up in museums," some of them chanted.</p>
      <p>They also shouted slogans against US President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and burned EU and US flags.</p>
      <p>Some 20,000 people marched in Athens, police said, in remembrance of dozens of people who died in the 1973 military crackdown on a student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic.</p>

      <p>Some 9,000 people demonstrated in Thessaloniki, authorities said. Separate demonstrations were being held in Greece's other major cities.</p>
      <p>The annual march in Athens regularly descends into violence and some 5,000 officers were mobilised there for the day, backed by drones, a helicopter and water cannon, police said.</p>
      <p>Several youths were arrested after Molotov firebombs and stones were found on a roof in the bohemian district of Exarchia, in an apparent plan to ambush riot police passing below.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, in a move seen as directed against the demonstration, the government secured parliamentary approval of a law applying harsher penalties for public violence.</p>
      <p>Throwing a Molotov cocktail -- a fairly frequent occurrence at demonstrations in Greece -- is now punishable by up to 10 years in prison, instead of five years previously.</p>
      <p>- Mayor's appeal -</p>
      <p>The demonstration marks the 46th anniversary of the student uprising. Traditionally, it ends in front of the American embassy, which was ringed with police vans, as the fervently anti-Communist dictators enjoyed backing from Washington.</p>
      <p>At least 24 people were killed in the crackdown, an event generally considered to have broken the junta's grip on power and helped the restoration of democracy.</p>

      <p>The bloodstained flag that flew over the Polytechnic's iron gate, which was crushed by a tank that night, was carried at the head of the demonstration in the capital, a longstanding tradition.</p>
      <p>Athens mayor Kostas Bakoyannis urged respect for the city.</p>
      <p>"On this anniversary, let's send out the right message. A shared message about memory," he wrote in a Facebook message Friday.</p>
      <p>"We should not obscure the essence which is the struggle of youth for democracy. On this anniversary, let's show respect toward the city."</p>
      <p>The anti-junta demonstration is a treasured anniversary for many Greeks.</p>
      <p>- 'Junta applauder' accusation -</p>
      <p>In recent years, demonstrators have used the anniversary to voice opposition to US "imperialism", and the harsh austerity measures imposed on Greece by international creditors after the global financial crisis.</p>

      <p>Mitsotakis's administration has come under fire over a flurry of police operations against anarchist squats and demonstrators.</p>
      <p>Main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras, the former PM, on Sunday accused the conservative government of harbouring "junta applauders" in its midst, referring to former far-right politicians given cabinet posts by Mitsotakis.</p>
      <p>There is also tension over a recent amendment to facilitate police checks in universities, which has prompted several student protests.</p>
      <p>"Police have no place in universities... but neither does lawlessness," Citizen's Protection Minister Michalis Chrysohoidis told To Vima weekly on Sunday.</p>

      <p>This week the Polytechnic's rector Andreas Bantouvas said: "We need to be careful these days, and (public) comments must be guarded."</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Kostas Tsiaras, speaking ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary vote, told lawmakers ahead of the vote in parliament: "Laws and regulations are needed for Greek citizens to feel safe."</p>
      <p>On Monday, some 200 students demonstrating at the Athens University of Economics were surrounded by anti-riot police who used tear gas and arrested two protesters.</p>
