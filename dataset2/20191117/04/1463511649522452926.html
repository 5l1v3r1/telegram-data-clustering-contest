      <h1>Police to protesting truck drivers: Don’t take laws into your hands</h1>

      <p>The Ogun State Police Command has advised truck drivers plying Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway to report their grievances to authorities instead of causing gridlock for motorists.</p>
      <p>DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, gave the advice on Saturday in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria in Ota, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi said the drivers should always look for a better ways of reporting their grievances to the authority whenever they had any conflict with any of the traffic agencies.</p>
      <p>Oyeyemi, however, said the police and others security agencies were on ground to clear the gridlock on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.</p>
      <p>A NAN correspondent who visited Ewekoro in Ogun on Saturday gathered that several motorists and passengers were stranded on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.</p>
      <p>It was also gathered that a conflict broke out between the drivers and the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps that towed two of the drivers’ trucks to Abeokuta.</p>
      <p>The drivers later used two of their trucks to block the major Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway, which resulted in serious gridlocks from Ifo to Ewekoro.</p>
      <p>One of the drivers who spoke, pleading anonymity, said this was not the first time the TRACE officials would be towing their vehicles to their office.</p>
      <p>Dare Ogunrinde, a commercial driver, described the development as worrisome.</p>
      <p>Ogunrinde said he left Lagos at about 5:30am and was not yet in Abeokuta, noting that he spent more than four hours in the gridlock.</p>
      <p>Babatunde Akinbiyi, TRACE Public Relations Officer, said they had given directive to the drivers not to park indiscriminately.</p>
      <p>Akinbiyi said the matter had been resolved and the keys of the two trucks had been returned to the drivers.</p>
