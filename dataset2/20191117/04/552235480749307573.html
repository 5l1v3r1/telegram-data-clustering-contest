      <h1>Grieving mum says NHS hospital chiefs are 'bullying' water bug scandal whistleblower</h1>
      <h2>Kimberly Darroch lost her daughter Milly Main after she was treated at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>A mum whose daughter <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">died after catching an infection</a> at a flagship hospital has demanded the health board stop “bullying and intimidating” the whistleblower who exposed the scandal.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Darroch believes her daughter Milly Main, 10, caught a lethal dirty water bug when in remission from cancer at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.</a></p>
      <p>The £842million site, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children, is in crisis over a series of patient safety scandals.</p>

      <p>Grieving Kimberly, from Lanark, only discovered the truth when Labour MSP Anas Sarwar revealed in the Scottish Parliament that a whistleblower had approached him with details of the case.</p>
      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">since criticised the staff member who highlighted Milly’s death.</a></p>
      <p>A spokesman for the board said it was “extremely disappointing” a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">whistleblower had made the claim.</a></p>
      <p>But Kimberly, 35, told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/cancer-ward-glasgow-super-hospital-18826742">Sunday Mail</a>: “I want to thank the whistleblower for coming forward and hope to meet them face-to-face one day to say thank you in person.</p>
      <p>“The bullying and intimidation from the health board has to stop and they need to show genuine remorse rather than the insulting statements they have been putting out.”</p>

      <p>A report earlier this year found 23 children with cancer had acquired infections linked to the water supply in two RHC wards in 2018.</p>
      <p>The bacterium stenotrophomonas, which was cited as Milly’s cause of death, was linked to 12 of the cases.</p>
      <p>But the whistleblower has said an internal inquiry focusing on 2017 found another 26 cases.</p>
      <p>Sarwar, Labour MSP for Glasgow, wants NHSGGC’s handling of hospital infection issues <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">to come under greater scrutiny.</a></p>
      <p>He said staff should be able to “speak out in confidence they will not lose their jobs”.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she learned of the case in September but did not make details public because of patient confidentiality.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Conservatives said she should resign or be sacked.</p>
