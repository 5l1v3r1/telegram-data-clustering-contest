      <p>Hollywood star Nicolas Cage is in talks to play himself in meta drama The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent.</p>
      <p>Tom Gormican is directing the Lionsgate project, reported Variety.</p>
      <p>Gormican has also co-written the script with Kevin Etten.</p>
      <p>If deals close, Cage would star as actor Nicolas Cage. The character is desperate to get a role in a new Tarantino movie while also dealing with a strained relationship with his teenage daughter. He also occasionally talks to an egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore.</p>
      <p>The character is also under a lot of debt and finds himself forced to make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican billionaire who happens to be a fan of the actor’s work and hopes to show him a script on which he has been working.</p>
      <p>The film will pay tributes to Cage’s works such as Leaving Las Vegas, Face-Off and Gone in 60 Seconds.</p>
      <p>Cage will produce the project via his Saturn Films banner, alongside Mike Nilon and Kevin Turen.</p>
