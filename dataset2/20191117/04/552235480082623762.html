      <p>A woman has pleaded for help in solving the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/i-dont-believe-mum-murdered-12021585">50-year mystery of her mum’s disappearance</a> after her brother died without ever finding out what happened.</p>
      <p>Teacher <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/hunt-for-missing-teacher-ellen-ruffle-1131623">Ellen Ruffle</a> was last seen on November 14, 1969, after dropping off 18-month-old Graham at his gran’s home.</p>
      <p>The mum of two was 34 when she vanished and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/hunt-for-missing-teacher-ellen-ruffle-1131623">no body has ever been found.</a></p>

      <p>In 2012, police searched the home she shared with husband Norman in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell">Motherwell.</a></p>
      <p>Last week marked 50 years since Ellen disappeared. Now her daughter Rosemary Lindes, 54, has told of her sadness at Graham’s death last year without finding out the truth. He was 50.</p>
      <p>Rosemary, who now lives in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/rugby/england-12-south-africa-32-20793492">Johannesburg</a>, said: “My mother’s disappearance really affected Graham’s life.</p>
      <p>“Her disappearance haunted him. It’s so sad he died before we got to find out what happened to her.</p>
      <p>“Now I find comfort in thinking that if my mother is dead and there’s an afterlife, then they’ll be reunited.”</p>

      <p>In 2018, Graham said: “All I want is to know what happened to my mum before I die.”</p>
      <p>Now Rosemary has vowed to carry on fighting to find out what happened to her mum.</p>
      <p>She: “All I wish for is someone to come forward and put that piece in the puzzle.</p>
      <p>“Even if she has died, even if it’s only a grave left, that would be closure.”</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: “<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/i-dont-believe-mum-murdered-12021585">Ellen Ruffle</a> is still being treated as a missing person 50 years since she was last seen.</p>
      <p>“If any new information is received in relation to her from when she was last seen in 1969 until now, this will be fully investigated.”</p>
