      <h1>Huppert spurs on aspiring actresses at Myanmar film fest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:10:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Award-winning French actress Isabelle Huppert urged Myanmar women wanting to make it in the world of cinema to go for it, as she added star power to <a href="https://coconuts.co/yangon/">Yangon’s MEMORY! film festival</a>.</p>
      <p>The Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee took to the red carpet at Friday’s opening night held at the city’s recently-restored and oldest cinema.</p>
      <p>Bats wheeled round the downtown, colonial-era theater as Huppert’s 1995 movie “La Ceremonie” kicked off the 10-day event.</p>
      <p>Huppert, whose more than 120 films include “Elle” and “The Piano Teacher”, said she was unfazed when a power cut — a common occurrence in the city — briefly interrupted the movie.</p>
      <p>“They warned me these things might happen,” she told AFP in an exclusive interview Saturday.</p>
      <p>The actress, who has eight of her films showing at the festival, described how all her movies speak about the “feminine condition” and what it means to be a woman fighting to survive.</p>
      <p>“I would say I’ve always been a feminist without knowing it,” she said, urging Myanmar women wanting to get into cinema to go ahead and believe in themselves.</p>
      <p>“You have to overcome so many obstacles in life that you mustn’t create them yourself.”</p>
      <p>This is the seventh edition of the MEMORY! film festival, which this year boasts some 70 movies in its bid to bring worldwide and regional cinema to Myanmar’s public.</p>
      <p>As the country gears up to celebrate a century of film-making next year, the event also features screenings of painstakingly-restored Myanmar classics.</p>
      <p>Huppert preferred not to dwell on the controversy shaking the French film industry over fresh allegations of abuse against French-Polish director Roman Polanski — but said she thinks people should not boycott his latest movie.</p>
      <p>A French photographer became the latest woman to accuse the 86-year-old of rape days before his award-winning movie, “An Officer and a Spy”, opened in French cinemas.</p>
      <p>Polanski has fiercely denied the accusations and has threatened to sue.</p>
      <p>Asked what France’s film industry could do to treat women better, Huppert said it should start by giving them equal wages.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same in every field. Women have always suffered discrimination.”</p>
