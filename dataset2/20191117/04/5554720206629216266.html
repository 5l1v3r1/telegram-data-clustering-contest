      <p>Disha Patani and Salman Khan may have sizzled on the <i>Slow Motion </i>track in this year’s blockbuster <i>Bharat, </i>but both of them were left dethroned as the Bollywood megastar personally handed over the title to <i>Bigg Boss </i>contestant Rashami Desai.</p>

      <p><i>Slow Motion </i>was one of the most popular tracks of <i>Bharat </i>as Salman and Disha Patani set the screen on fire with their sizzling performance. The film had gone on to become one of the biggest hits of 2019.</p>
      <p>While hosting the <i>Weekend Ka Vaar </i>episode of the Colors TV’s reality show, Salman informed the housemates that Rashami was deserving of the <i>Slow Motion </i>title because of her lack of enthusiasm after her re-entry into the house<i>.</i></p>
      <p>Salman asked Rashami if she was happy on being declared the <i>Slow Motion </i>contestant in the house. Rashami promises to improve her game in the days to come.</p>
      <p>Rashami was evicted out of the show along with Devoleena Bhattacharjee, but they were given a second chance by the makers of <i>Bigg Boss. </i>But her lack of enthusiasm has come under scrutiny ever since she made a second entry in the house.</p>
      <p>Salman wondered if her new strategy was to provoke two people to fight with each other while she remained a spectator. The Bollywood megastar also slammed Rashami for backstabbing her friend Arhaan Khan by not picking him for the captaincy role as she had voted for Aditya Vishal Singh.</p>
      <p>Each housemate on Saturday night was asked to pick a placard with a title. Most of the contestants felt that Rashami deserved the title of <i>Slow Motion. </i>Salman too agreed and said that the popular daughter-in-law of Indian TV ought to have changed her game inside the house to make her presence felt.</p>

      <p>The house once again saw a brief war of word between Shefali Jariwala and Mahira Sharma. What irked Mahira was Shefali calling her a ‘problem child.’ An angry Mahira shouted, “You can’t speak to me like that.” Unfazed by her shouting, Shefali replied stating that she was indeed a problem child as she had to be sent to the jail last week for her questionable behaviour.</p>
      <p>The house once again witnessed romance blossoming between Siddharth Shukla and Devoleena Bhattacharjee. Devoleena’s flirtatious behaviour towards Siddharth has become the most-talked-about development in the <i>Bigg Boss </i>house.</p>
      <p>Salman did not announce the name of the contestant leaving the show. He said that he will announce the name on Sunday night.</p>
