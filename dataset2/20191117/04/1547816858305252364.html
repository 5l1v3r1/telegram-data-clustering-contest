      <p>Bigg Boss 13 is turning out to be quite an interesting season and right from ex-contestants to other celebrities, many of them have been following the controversial reality show and the contestants. Now, Krushna Abhishek, who is Arti Singh’s brother, has now opened up about her sister’s performance on the show and also about what he really thinks of Sidharth Shukla, in a recent interview with Times Of India. He said Sidharth Shukla is ‘muhfat’ (straightforward) just like his wife Kashmera Shah, but he isn’t a bad person.</p>
      <p>Krusha Abhishek mentioned that earlier Arti Singh was scared of opening up since she comes from a family of actors, and knows that their reputation is at stake. He said, “. If you have ever interacted with Arti, you will realise she is not a badtameez girl, she is a very soft-spoken girl until she is poked. You have never seen me walking off on someone or being rude to anyone. Arti is also like that.” He said that she was holding herself back, but now after the way Sidharth Shukla talks to her, he is happy she has started giving it back. I am glad that she is taking a stand for herself which she should do. I have always told her don't compromise when it is about your respect and speak up if someone disrespects you," he said. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-jai-veeru-war-asim-riaz-s-brother-umar-blames-arti-singh-and-shehnaaz-gill-for-breaking-asim-s-dosti-with-sidharth-shukla/5dcfdd7d87fb571eff7e3f3b">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13, Jai-Veeru War: Asim Riaz's Brother, Umar BLAMES Arti Singh And Shehnaaz Gill For Breaking Asim's Dosti With Sidharth Shukla- EXCLUSIVE</a></p>

      <p>Further talking about Sidharth Shukla,  Krushna said that he has met him and Sidharth is just muhfat, but isn’t a bad guy. “People who are muhfat are not bad. Kashmera is muhfat, but that doesn't mean she is a bad person.” He also said that he thinks Sidharth is not able to deal with the pressure of living in the BB house without any outside communication and that is why he is reacting. He also said that he is happy Arti has started reacting and has stopped giving bhav to Shukla.</p>
