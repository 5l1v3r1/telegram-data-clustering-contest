      <h1>Yahoo NFL DFS Picks Week 11: Daily fantasy football lineup advice for GPP tournaments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:49:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:49</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>Who knew it would be Saquon Barkley letting us down in our Yahoo daily fantasy football GPP lineup last week? Everything started so great with our Ravens triple-stack of Lamar Jackson, Marquise Brown, and Mark Andrews, and we had Derrick Henry go crazy, too. If only Saquon hadn't gotten exactly one rushing yard on 13 carries. Yuck. We'll try to carry the positive momentum of our stack into Week 11 as we try to climb some tournament leaderboards in NFL DFS action on Yahoo.</p>
      <p>Bear with me this week when we go from Jackson last week to Ryan Finley as our Week 11 QB. It makes some sense, trust me. It also allows us to play Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Julio Jones, so all value comes with some equal and opposite studs.</p>

      <h3>NFL DFS Week 11: Yahoo GPP Lineup Picks</h3>
      <p><b>QB Ryan Finley, Bengals @ Raiders ($23). </b>Finley looked passable in his NFL debut, showing off some arm talent and also rushing five times for 22 yards. The Raiders are allowing the fifth-most fantasy points to QBs, so we'll take a shot on Finley to allow us to pay up at running back.</p>
      <p><b>RB Christian McCaffrey, Panthers vs. Falcons ($41). </b>McCaffrey continues to be the highest-priced player and will continue to be popular, but to win a tournament, you need upside from your cheapest and most expensive choices, and McCaffrey should start us off on the right foot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 11 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/ob2l6y92sylb1aavyt6fu6evw">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1ink24648r3za1gkam0igv3ff9">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1k2ogltnjx2se1la6u4i3dbbtl">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>RB Alvin Kamara, Saints @ Buccaneers ($30). </b>Kamara's Week 10 numbers are misleading -- he played more than three times as much as Latavius Murray. After a down week, the Saints should course correct and give Kamara all the touches he can handle against Tampa Bay. Given last week's results and Tampa's tough run defense, Kamara could be low-owned, too.</p>
      <p><b>WR Auden Tate, Bengals @ Raiders ($18). </b>Tate is probably the most likely Cincy receiver to catch a touchdown from Finley, and he continues to get consistent targets with A.J. Green out. He's the most logical stack with Finley at a cheaper price than Tyler Boyd and with Alex Erickson disappearing in Week 10.</p>
      <p><b>WR Mohamed Sanu, Patriots @ Eagles ($18). </b>Sanu's 10-catch Week 9 didn't appear to be a fluke -- he didn't come off the field and was targeted 14 times. New England should ride Tom Brady's arm again against a bad Philadelphia defense, giving Sanu a great floor and almost as appealing ceiling.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>WR Robby Anderson, Jets @ Redskins ($12). </b>Anderson's price has declined after a couple of down weeks, but we know that he can connect on a long touchdown with Sam Darnold at any moment. Washington's secondary won't be the one to stop that from happening.</p>
      <p><b>TE T.J. Hockenson, Lions vs. Cowboys ($12). </b>The Cowboys allow the fifth-most fantasy points to tight ends, and Hockenson remains one of the more matchup-dependent tight ends in the league. If Jeff Driskel plays, that should just deperess Hockenson's ownership enough to make him more appealing.</p>

      <p><b>D/ST Minnesota Vikings vs. Broncos ($16).</b> While Brandon Allen didn't look terrible before Denver's bye, he's still a young QB making a start on the road against a solid defense, and there's nothing about Allen that scares us.</p>
