      <p>Oklahoma rallied from a 21-point halftime deficit at Baylor on Saturday night to pull off a crazy comeback victory and remain in the College Football Playoff race.</p>
      <p>The Sooners, who trailed 31-10 at halftime, pulled off a wild comeback in the second half. Oklahoma ultimately took the lead with less than two minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Lincoln Riley’s team pulled off a 34-31 victory on a game-winning field goal. The win was sealed when the Sooners picked off a Charlie Brewer pass.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts had an incredible reaction to the big win. He was so nervous he couldn’t watch what was happening.</p>
