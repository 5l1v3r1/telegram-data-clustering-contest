      <h2>War game delay is latest effort to revive denuclearisation talks with Kim Jong Un</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:56:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author">Demetri Sevastopulo, Edward White</a></address>
      <p>The US and South Korea have postponed a joint military exercise, in an effort to help diplomatic efforts aimed at convincing North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Thailand on Sunday, Mark Esper, US defence secretary, said Washington and Seoul had decided to delay the joint air force exercise — known as the “Combined Flying Training Event” — that had been scheduled to start on Monday.</p>
      <p>The decision came just two days after Mr Esper and General Mark Milley, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, met their counterparts in Seoul for consultations about shoring up the US-South Korea alliance and efforts to deal with North Korea.</p>
      <p>“The reason we are doing that is to give the North Koreans an opportunity to reconsider some of their recent provocations and to come back to the negotiating table,” Gen Milley told the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal as he flew back to Washington from a visit to Japan and South Korea.</p>
      <p>The move to postpone the exercises — previously known as “Vigilant Ace” — comes as the US tries to rebuild momentum to stalled negotiations over denuclearisation. Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator, pledged nuclear disarmament to Donald Trump, US president, in June 2018 at their first summit in Singapore.</p>
      <p>The two leaders held a second meeting in Hanoi in February that collapsed when Mr Kim offered a deal that would not amount to full denuclearisation. They met again in June in the demilitarised zone, the area dividing the two Koreas, and Mr Kim agreed to send officials back to the negotiating table for the first time since the Hanoi meeting.</p>
      <p>Steve Biegun, the US negotiator for North Korea, met his counterpart in Stockholm last month for two days of talks that yielded no tangible progress. Washington wants to kick-start the talks amid warnings from Pyongyang that it will return to a much more aggressive posture if there is no deal by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Mr Kim earlier this year said he would be “patient” until the end of the year, a statement widely viewed as setting a time limit for a diplomatic breakthrough. In recent weeks, North Korean state-run media have echoed that message, in a sign that it could resume nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.</p>
      <p>Experts agreed the move could rebuild momentum but were wary of potentially weakening the combat readiness of US and South Korean troops.</p>
      <p>Jina Kim, a Seoul-based military expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses think-tank, said with Pyongyang’s “deadline’ for talks looming, the priority is “not to give North Korea any reason to justify walking away from negotiation and seeking an alternate path”.</p>
      <p>However, one former top South Korean official said while there would be “a better chance” of talks resuming, the capability for combined operations by the US and South Korea would “suffer” even as Mr Kim continues to build his nuclear arsenal.</p>
      <p>Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official, added that suspending the exercise also risked “emboldening” Mr Kim.</p>
      <p>“North Korea makes coercive demands of the US, and the US capitulates to those demands,” he said.</p>
      <p>Since the Hanoi summit, North Korea has tested a number of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, after a hiatus since late 2017. Critically, however, it has not tested any intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has also returned to the similar kind of harsh rhetoric it levelled at the US before the Singapore meeting.</p>
      <p>Although North Korea conducts its own military exercises, it condemns the war games the US and South Korea routinely conduct on the peninsula. Just hours after his Singapore meeting with Mr Kim in 2018, Mr Trump abruptly cancelled big joint exercises without informing his military officials in advance.</p>
      <p>Jim Mattis, then US defence secretary, later that year cancelled the Vigilant Ace exercise, as Mr Trump insisted that the US open up more space for diplomacy.</p>
