      <p>Former Derby County assistant manager Jody Morris has reportedly been warned by Chelsea about his social media activity after a post in reference to ex-Blues boss Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Morris was <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard's</a> assistant at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Pride Park</a> last season, before moving back to Stamford Bridge with his former teammate when Lampard became the new Chelsea head coach in July.</p>
      <p>Morris is active on Instagram and Twitter, as he was during his Rams spell.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7690741/Chelsea-warn-Jody-Morris-social-media-use-mocked-bitter-Jose-Mourinho.html">the Daily Mail,</a> he has been told by Chelsea "to tone down his social media activity" following the Mourinho post.</p>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> full-back Shane Nicholson believes his old club are 'making progress'.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">The Rams</a> have made a slow start to the season and indeed to life under <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/phillip-cocu">Phillip Cocu</a> , sitting 16th in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>But they are still within seven points of the play-offs, as well as heading in the right direction, according to Nicholson.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/2019/11/nicholson-im-encouraged-by-derbys-attacking-play">Speaking on RamsTV</a> , the former defender who made 74 league appearances said: "Looking at the last three games we have managed something like 19 shots on target.</p>
      <p>“For me, that shows that we are making progress. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-promotion-odds-forest-3415135">Against Forest last weekend</a> we had 11 shots and seven of them were on target as well, which tells you the team is creating chances.</p>

      <p>There has been an update on the reported interest from Derby in D.C. United midfielder <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/who-luciano-acosta-profile-dc-3533464">Luciano Acosta</a> .</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-lucharoo-3530596">interview in Argentina</a> , Acosta claimed his former D.C. United team-mate, Derby-bound <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> , had told him to join him at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Rooney joins the Rams as a player-coach in January after spending nearly two years in the United States with the MLS outfit.</p>
      <p>Acosta has also called time on his D.C. United career, and is looking for a new club.</p>
      <p>Fresh reports in <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/?source=googleuksearchads&amp;ad_id=394570647773&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw-3n-rLs5QIVh7PtCh1MvQ-zEAAYASABEgJf_PD_BwE">The Athletic</a> claim that Acosta is “waiting for the call” from Derby over a potential move, but there has been no sign from the Rams that deal could take place.</p>
