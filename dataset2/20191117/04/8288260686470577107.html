      <h2>West Brom news| One of the club's brightest prospects has been linked with a Premier League move after his flying start to the season</h2>

      <h3>FERGUSON LINKED WITH SPURS</h3>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion could cash in on Nathan Ferguson in the January transfer window to avoid losing him for a cut-price fee in the summer.</p>
      <p>Premier League duo Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace are said to be interested in the England Under-20 international.</p>
      <p>Ferguson has impressed for Slaven Bilic's Championship table-toppers this season, making 13 appearances.</p>
      <p>According to the Daily Mail , the Baggies are worried they might have to sell Ferguson in the New Year with his contract up in the summer.</p>

      <h3>DEALING WITH DIANGANA</h3>
      <p>Darnell Furlong can appreciate the daunting task facing Grady Diangana’s opponents in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Diangana, who is on loan at West Bromwich Albion from West Ham, has been in superb form this season with four goals and four assists in 14 appearances.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old’s scintillating displays have prompted concern over a January recall - which Manuel Pellegrini appears to have quashed - and earned him an England under-21 call-up.</p>
      <p>And Furlong only has to think back to pre-season to recognise just how tough facing Diangana is.</p>
      <p>“There was a game at QPR in pre season where we played West Ham, he played second half, I played the first half,” Furlong said. “I remember watching the second half thinking, wow this kid’s sharp and really effective.</p>
      <p>“That was all I really knew about him. But since he’s come in he’s been on fire, he’s a real problem for full-backs. He’s really hard to deal with, even in training.</p>

      <h3>SAM JOHNSTONE INTERVIEW</h3>
      <p>There aren’t many chinks in West Brom’s armour right now - but goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has found one.</p>
      <p>Back-to-back away wins before the international break saw the  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Baggies</a>  extend their unbeaten run to six matches and maintain a two-point lead at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Slaven Bilic’s raft of summer signings have gelled almost right away. His team are scoring goals for fun and are now beginning to keep clean sheets away from home.</p>
      <p>But, with a home match against Sheffield Wednesday next on the agenda, there’s still one nagging concern for  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/sam-johnstone">Johnstone</a> .</p>
