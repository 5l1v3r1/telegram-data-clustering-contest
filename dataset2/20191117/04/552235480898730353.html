      <p>Witnesses in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/emma-caldwell-murder-cops-close-16174664">Emma Caldwell</a> murder case have been interviewed by Crown Office lawyers as the reopened investigation reaches a critical new phase.</p>
      <p>Solicitors under the instruction of the Lord Advocate, Scotland’s leading prosecutor, have taken statements from people identified as being vital to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/emma-caldwell-murder-cops-close-16174664">second police probe into 27-year-old Emma’s death.</a></p>
      <p>The interviews have taken place as the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service lay the groundwork for a court case.</p>
      <p>A police report on the murder, following a renewed four-year investigation, was filed to the Crown last year.</p>
      <p>A source said: “The new police investigation was painstaking as it re-examined all the avenues of investigation from the original case, plus some significant new lines of inquiry.</p>

      <p>“The report remains officially under consideration but the Crown has been working hard on it ever since it was submitted.</p>
      <p>“The time it has taken will not have been easy for the family but there is a determination that this investigation will be watertight.”</p>
      <p>Emma, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/jealous-husband-who-threatened-kill-20764146">Erskine, Renfrewshire,</a> went missing in March 2005 from the hostel where she lived in the south side of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>She had become depressed following the loss of her sister and turned to drugs before working as a prostitute to fund the habit.</p>
      <p>Her body was found in a remote location in woods near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lanark">Roberton, Lanarkshire</a>, several weeks later.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A murder inquiry resulted in four Turkish nationals being accused of Emma’s murder but charges were dropped as a crucial translation of recorded audio evidence was botched.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the Sunday Mail revealed the identity of a forgotten suspect who was interviewed six times by police but never charged.</p>
      <p>Later that year, then Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland ordered the investigation to be reopened.</p>
      <p>The suspect, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/emma-caldwell-murder-cops-close-16174664">who cannot now be named for legal reasons and who has since been accused of other criminal offences</a> , has denied any involvement but admitted he knew Emma.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, a major new inquiry into unsolved historic crimes on the back of the reopened murder probe was revealed by the Sunday Mail.</p>
      <p>That investigation, which remains ongoing, is looking at sexual offences which emerged following a re-examination of more than 1000 statements given to the original inquiry into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/vice-girl-pals-emma-caldwell-12088709">Emma’s death.</a></p>
      <p>Her mum Margaret has frequently spoken of the family’s frustration at the long wait for justice.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In an interview in August last year, she said: “The new investigation into my daughter’s death started more than three years ago and it is more than 13 years since she died.</p>
      <p>“Above all, I would like to see justice for Emma but I would be happy if the inquiry into her death might also give justice to other women and victims.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: “This is a live investigation and it would not be appropriate to comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent David McLaren said: “The investigation into Emma Caldwell’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/vice-girl-pals-emma-caldwell-12088709">murder</a> remains open and a team of detectives continue to examine the circumstances of her death.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Officers have undertaken a significant amount of work re-investigating the whole case and surrounding events in conjunction with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, following instruction from the Lord Advocate in 2015.</p>
      <p>“An advice and guidance report was submitted to the COPFS in June last year, which presented the findings, so far, of the murder re-investigation.”</p>
