      <h1>Week 11 FanDuel Picks: NFL DFS lineup advice, strategy for daily fantasy football GPP tournaments</h1>

      <p>FanDuel GPPs in Week 11 will be yet another opportunity to take advantage of Christian McCaffrey ownership that's too low. Starting our NFL DFS tournament lineups with him requires some value elsewhere, but in the form of Brian Hill, we get the perfect sleeper to complement CMC. Using those two as a starting point in our example daily fantasy football lineup picks for Week 11 gets us a squad that has a great blend of floor and upside.</p>
      <p>If you're new to this article, we pick four players every week we'll be overweight in our lineup builds. Then, we give an example of how we'd fill in around them in tournaments. Our "Core Four" this week is Jameis Winston, Christian McCaffrey, Brian Hill and Dede Westbrook. This isn't an "optimal lineup"; rather, it's an example of one you could build if you start with our "Core Four".

      <h3>FanDuel Picks Week 11: NFL DFS example lineup for GPPs</h3>
      <p>
        <b>CORE PLAY QB: </b>
        <b>Jameis Winston, Buccaneers vs. Saints ($7,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quarterback pricing is tough this week, and it’s going to be hard to spend up on Lamar Jackson, Deshaun Watson, or Drew Brees if you are also playing Christian McCaffrey. Someone who is priced down a bit on FanDuel as opposed to DraftKings is Winston at $7,600. Winston has been extremely consistent from a fantasy point of view this season, having thrown for more 300 yards and at least one touchdown in each of his past four games. He is also flashing some sneaky athleticism on the ground in an attempt to limit his turnovers with 13 rushes for 101 yards across his past three games.<br/><br/>The matchup with the Saints isn’t easy given the huge D-Line/O-Line mismatch that they present to the Bucs offense. Still, this game will be played in Tampa, and Winston does have a decent history against the Saints in his career, having thrown for five touchdowns against them over his past three starts vs. New Orleans. With Tampa entering this game as 6.5-point home underdogs, we can expect Winston to be forced to throw upwardof 40 times in this game, which only boosts his median projection.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CORE PLAY RB: Christian McCaffrey, Panthers vs. Falcons ($10,500)</b>
      </p>
      <p>I included McCaffrey in my core plays last week specifically because I said there would be plenty of DFSplayers out there who would fade him in both cash games and GPPs, and sure enough, he was less than 50-percentowned in most cash games and less than 30-percent owned in most GPPs. I’m going right back to him this week in yet another great matchup against the Falcons at home.</p>
      <p>The Falcons have been better this season against the run, they are still a middle-of-the-pack unit, and I’m not buying a second-half defensive revival after they looked great last week. CMC is expensive yet again this week, but I’m more than willing to pay the $10,500 price tag in all formats if I can lock in 25-plusfantasy points. McCaffrey has exceeded 25 touches in all but two games this season, and there aren’t many situations that would see him get under that number with Carolina entering this game at 5.5-point home favorites in a game with a 50.5-point total.</p>

      <p>
        <b>CORE PLAY RB: Brian Hill, Falcons @ Panthers ($5,900)</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are a few value options at running back this week that make it easier to stomach rostering McCaffrey at his price tag. One of those isHill at $5,900. Hill will be seeing a role increase after the Falcons lost Devonta Freeman for the next few weeks because of a foot injury. I like talent Hill hasflashed in his limited playing time, but what’s more appealing is the matchup with the Panthers. Carolina has been absolutely gashed on the ground the last few weeks, and its inability to stop the Packers’ running backs last week was a major reason why it lost the game.<br/><br/>Since the Panthers' Week 7 bye, they have allowed an outrageously bad 445 yards rushing and eightrushing touchdowns, making Hill a lock for cash games and someone I’m looking to play in GPPs despite likely high ownership.</p>

        <b>WEEK 11 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/ob2l6y92sylb1aavyt6fu6evw">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1ink24648r3za1gkam0igv3ff9">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1k2ogltnjx2se1la6u4i3dbbtl">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>CORE PLAY WR: Dede Westbrook, Jaguars @ Colts ($5,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>I always have a soft spot for cheap wide receivers on FanDuel, and Westbrook really stands out as a great value at his $5,400 price tag. Westbrook should be healthy coming off of the Jaguars bye week, and he gets the added bump of having Nick Foles -- who loves throwing up the seams -- back at quarterback. Westbrook has seen 28 targets over the past three games that he started and finished, and that type of volume is incredibly valuable at this price point. The matchup isn’t the best against the Colts on the road, but it's not bad enough for me to consider not playing him in this spot at this price.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WR: Chris Godwin, Buccaneers vs. Saints ($8,000)</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m going with Godwin over Mike Evans in this lineup, and I do prefer Godwin slightly more in tournaments regardless of the status of Marshon Lattimore. Godwin has had a couple of mediocre games in a row, but a home game against a Saints team that has traditionally struggled against slot receivers is a prime breakout spot for Godwin, who should also come in at lower ownership than Evans.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>WR: Ted Ginn Jr., Saints @ Buccaneers ($5,200)</b>
      </p>
      <p>I want to run a Saints player with the Winston-Godwin stack, and while I wish I could get up to Michael Thomas, I’d rather play Christian McCaffrey, so I’m going with Ginn at $5,200. Ginn is, of course, a boom-or-bust play, but he is the best vertical threat on the Saints, and we’ve seen Tampa get destroyed all year long by vertical passing plays. Look no further than what Christian Kirk did to the Bucs last week on the outside.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TE: Eric Ebron, Colts vs. Jaguars ($5,200)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ebron had a classic “squeaky wheel” game last week, seeing a season-high in targets (12) after complaining mid-week about his usage in the offense. With T.Y. Hilton (calf) likely to sit out another week or two, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Ebron get eight-plus targets yet again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FLEX: Ezekiel Elliott, Cowboys @ Lions ($8,400)</b>
      </p>
      <p>His price is excellent on FanDuel at $8,400, and this is a prime spot for Elliott to havea ceiling-type game against the Lions, who rank dead last DvP against running backs. I expect all of McCaffrey, Fournette, and Dalvin Cook to be higher owned than Elliott this week, making him an ideal high-end pivot play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>D/ST: Carolina Panthers vs. Falcons ($3,7</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Panthers are very cheap for a home defense at $3,700, and Matt Ryan may have to throw 35-40 times in this game with Atlanta coming in as 5.5-point underdogs and without one of his top targets in TE Austin Hooper. Some may complain about anti-correlation with Brian Hill also in the lineup, but I have zero concerns given the cheap price points of both Hill and the Panthers D/ST.</p>
