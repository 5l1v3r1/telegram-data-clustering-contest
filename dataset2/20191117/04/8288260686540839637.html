      <p>League Two side Swindon Town have confirmed they have re-signed former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> defender Paul Caddis.</p>
      <p>Caddis rejoins the Robins on a short-term deal, six years after leaving the club to sign for Blues in 2013.</p>
      <p>The experienced right-back made more than 150 appearances in two spells for Blues, with his first stint coming as a loan spell from Swindon in the 2012-13 season.</p>
      <p>His move to St Andrew’s was then made permanent that summer, and he went on to spend three-and-a-half more seasons with Blues before signing for Bury in 2017.</p>
      <p>Since leaving Birmingham, Caddis has had spells at Bury, Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City, before rejoining the club he initially signed for in 2010.</p>
      <p>His first stint with Swindon saw Caddis make 92 appearances and has now re-signed for the club on a short-term deal.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining Swindon, the 31-year-old has been training with the club in recent weeks to keep fit and sharp and manager.</p>
      <p>“He is a very good trainer, very fit and a good footballer as well – and, above all, his attitude is spot on,” said manager Richie Wellens.</p>
      <p>Caddis featured in Swindon’s 302 win over Salford City on Saturday, coming on as a substitute for the final minutes of the clash at Moor Lane.</p>

      <p>Birmingham City are already a third of the way through the 2019-20 Championship campaign - and the January transfer window is fast approaching.</p>
      <p>The first month of 2020 will provide <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">Pep Clotet</a> and his rival managers in the second tier with the chance to bolster their squads for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Clotet has already spoken about his plans for the window and the club strategy that has been drawn up.</p>
      <p>"The club is preparing for any position in case something happens. We have a wide squad at the minute so we need to be selective with what we want to bring,” <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/birmingham-city-transfer-news-january-17179958">he said.</a></p>
      <p>“I know the club is working very hard and they have already our targets selected. That for me is a pleasure to see in a club.</p>
      <p>“The club is as committed as well as much as possible to be able to recruit as early as possible in January."</p>
      <p>So who could <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> look to bring in?</p>
      <p>We've gathered together a list of the players they have previously been linked with ahead of the window opening in seven weeks' time.</p>
