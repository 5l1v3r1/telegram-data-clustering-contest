      <h1>India vs Bangladesh: Indore Test victory might end rank-turner era at home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:11:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Ruchir-Mishra-479203379.cms" target="_blank">Ruchir Mishra</a></address>
      <p>INDORE: “The #curator in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indore">Indore</a> has produced such a superb Test Match strip...sadly he...&amp; many others in #MPCA would rue an earnest contest worthy of their efforts! B'Desh's intentions of batting 1st were good but not their application..or ability.! Test Crkt will continue to lose ‘appeal’!”</p>
      <p>This was a tweet from former India captain and legendary left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi on the opening day of the first Test. Bedi summed up the entire Test in his tweet. His words brought the spotlight on Madhya Pradesh <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Association (MPCA) curator Samander Singh Chauhan, who provided a perfect pitch for everyone.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Holkar-stadium">Holkar stadium</a> wicket had grass and bounce for the fast bowlers. The Indian fast-bowling trio picked up 14 of the 20 wickets. Later, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> seamer Abu Jayed also utilized the conditions well. If batsmen were willing to apply themselves, they could score runs, as Mayank Agrawal showed. It had something for spinners too, as Ashwin showed on the third day.</p>
      <p>India haven’t played much on such pitches at home over the last decade or so. They relied more on spinners than their pacers and generally asked for rank turners. The South Africa Test series in 2015 was a perfect example.</p>
      <p>However, the team management is now willing to play on challenging wickets.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the better Test wickets we have played on this year. It’s fantastic for Test cricket. It had something for everyone. Batters could score. There was a lot for seamers and we saw on the third day it was offering turn too,” India's batting coach Vikram Rathour said.</p>
      <p>Former BCCI secretary Sanjay Jagdale said, “If we play on these types of pitches, our dominance should begin abroad too.”</p>
