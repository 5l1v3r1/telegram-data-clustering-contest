      <h1>Bangladesh intercepts Malaysia-bound boat carrying 119 Rohingya</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:15:04+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Bangladesh coast guards intercepted a wooden boat carrying 119 <a href="https://coconuts.co/yangon/news/un-chief-urges-myanmar-to-ensure-safe-return-of-rohingya/">Rohingya refugees</a> bound for Malaysia as it was about to sink, officials said Thursday, the latest in a spate of trafficking incidents this year.</p>
      <p>Nearly one million Rohingya live in squalid camps near Bangladesh’s border with Myanmar, many fleeing the neighboring country after a brutal military crackdown began in 2017.</p>
      <p>With few opportunities for jobs and education in the camps, thousands have attempted to reach other countries like Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
      <p>The vessel was found in the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast of Bangladesh’s southern Saint Martin’s island, after a tip-off by fishermen, coast guard spokesman Saiful Islam told AFP.</p>
      <p>“We found that the boat was taking water due to engine failure,” Islam said. “It was about to sink. Had we not reached there in time, it would have sunk.”</p>
      <p>Islam said the 119 people on board, including 58 women and 14 children, were heading for Malaysi.</p>
      <p>It was the highest number of Rohingya found in a vessel at sea this year, he added.</p>
      <p>So far this year, Bangladesh’s law enforcement agencies have picked up over 500 Rohingya from coastal villages and boats as they waited to board boats bound for Malaysia.</p>
      <p>At least seven suspected human traffickers have been shot dead so far in 2019 in alleged gunfights with police.</p>
      <p>Trafficking often increases after the monsoon, when calm November seas allow small fishing trawlers to travel long distance.</p>
