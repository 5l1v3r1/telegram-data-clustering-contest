      <p>Attention will soon turn to the return of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>We are almost halfway through the final international break of 2019 and a hectic Premier League and European schedule is on the horizon.</p>
      <p>And then, soon enough, the January transfer window will be upon us too.</p>
      <p>With that in mind there is plenty of international action, Premier League and transfer window build-up in our round-up of the biggest news stories from around Stamford Bridge in the past 24 hours below.</p>
      <h3>Batshuayi blunder</h3>
      <p>Michy Batshuayi was in international action on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He came on as a 77th minute substitute as Belgium secured top spot in their Euro 2020 qualifying group with a 4-1 win over second-placed Russia.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But for the uneducated watching on it looked as though Batshuayi was involved from the beginning.</p>
      <p>That's because of a blunder on Belgium's part, or at least Dedryck Boyata's part.</p>

      <h3>Jadon Sancho transfer</h3>
      <p>Where will Jadon Sancho end up in the next season?</p>
      <p>The young England starlet has has been linked with a move to the Premier League, with reports suggesting he has told Borussia Dortmund that he wants to leave next summer, and Chelsea have been mooted as a potential destination.</p>

      <p>Sancho himself has admitted that he was inspired by Lampard and fellow Blues legend Didier Drogba when he was growing up, leading to speculation that he might be interested in playing under Lampard in the future.</p>
      <p>But one transfer decision could impact on Chelsea's ability to sign the flying forward next summer.</p>

      <h3>What will happen in January?</h3>
      <p>Frank Lampard is sure to be making plans for January already.</p>

      <p>The Blues are currently not allowed to bring any new players in, because of the two-window transfer ban imposed by FIFA.</p>
      <p>However, their appeal will be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport next week.</p>
      <p>And if the ban is overturned, what can the fans expect from the January window?</p>

      <h3>Sarri mistakes</h3>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri was not universally loved at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The Italian manager lasted just one season in the Premier League, before being axed by the Blues in favour of bringing back legend Frank Lampard.</p>

      <p>Lampard has set about revolutionising the Chelsea team and he has succeeded so far, with youth playing an integral part.</p>
      <p>Sarri's former assistant and another Blues legend Gianfranco Zola has opened up on the mistakes the Italian made at the helm.</p>
