      <h1>Week 11 NFL DFS Picks: Best value players, sleepers for FanDuel, DraftKings daily fantasy football lineups</h1>

      <p>There’s going to be some extreme chalk on the Week 11 NFL DFS main slate. Lamar Jackson and Drew Brees are two of the most expensive quarterbacks across the industry and both have slate-breaking potential (Jackson is matchup-proof and Brees will take aim at the vulnerable Buccaneers secondary). Christian McCaffrey and Michael Thomas will also likely be high-priced chalk options in FanDuel and DraftKings contests.If you want to jam in one, two, or three of the aforementioned superstars, you’re going to need to identify somesleepers to support your lineup picks around them. Below are some of the daily fantasy football value options that stand out.</p>

      <h3>NFL DFS Picks Week 11: QB sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Kyle Allen, Panthers vs. Falcons (DraftKings $5,300 | FanDuel $7,200)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Falcons inexplicably shut down the eliteSaints offense last week, which will keep the public off of Allen in this matchup. However, Atlanta has allowed 260.8 passing yards per game (25th) and 2.1 passing touchdowns per game (28th), which sets up the Panthers quarterbackin a pretty solid spot with some dangerous weapons for him to utilize.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ryan Fitzpatrick, Dolphins vs. Bills (DraftKings $5,100 | FanDuel $7,100)</b>
      </p>
      <p>At this point in his career, you know what you’re going to get out of Fitzpatrick. He was just named Miami’s starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after guiding the rebuilding team to two straight victories and has thrown the ball 35, 34, 36 and 33 times, respectively, over his past four contests. He went 23-for-35 for 282 yards, a touchdown and an interceptionagainst the Bills earlier this season and has a decent chance to improve upon that performance in Miami.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ryan Finley, Bengals at Raiders (DraftKings $5,000 | FanDuel $6,300)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s not beat around the bush: Finley’s NFL debut last week was ugly. He went 16-for-30 for 167 yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 49-13 loss to the Ravens. On the plus side, Finley should be able to rebound against Oakland’s defense since he will most likely play from behind and the Raiders have surrendered 283.2 passing yards per game this season (third worst). At his price tag across the industry, he’s worth considering.</p>

      <h3>Week 11 DraftKings, FanDuel Picks: RB sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Josh Jacobs, Raiders vs. Bengals (DraftKings $6,900 | FanDuel $8,000)</b>
      </p>
      <p>You don’t have to be a rocket scientist or an NFL coach to know what the Raiders will plan to do on offense against the Bengals. Cincinnati has been mindblowingly awful against the run this season (league-high 173rushing yards per game allowed). The next-worst team, Kansas City, has allowed 24.9 fewer rushing yards per contest than them. That means Jacobs will get touches early and often, and since he’s one of the few workhorse backs in the league, could see upwards of 30 touches if the Raiders get out to a lead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brian Hill, Falcons at Panthers (DraftKings $4,800 | FanDuel $5,900)</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Devonta Freeman slated to miss this game due to a foot injury, Hill becomes a logical option due to the volume he saw against the Saints last week (20 carries for 61 yards, one catch for 10 yards and a touchdown). The Panthers have struggled to contain the run and rank 29th, surrendering 136.7 rushing yards per contest.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Derrius Guice, Redskins vs. Jets (DraftKings $4,700 | FanDuel $4,700)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since rookie Dwayne Haskins has already been confirmed as the starting quarterback for the rest of the season, it makes sense for the Redskins (1-8) to give Guice an extended look at running back instead of giving veteran Adrian Peterson the bulk of the carries. As seen in brief spurts, Guice can be explosive, which makes him interesting, even against a formidable Jets rush defense.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>FanDuel, DraftKings Picks Week 11: WR sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Tre’Quan Smith, Saints at Buccaneers (DraftKings $3,800 | FanDuel $4,900)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Michael Thomas will likely be the chalkiest wideout on the slate, and he’s a phenomenal play. However, he’s expensive across the industry and it makes sense to consider other pieces of New Orleans’ passing offense against the porous Bucs defense. Tampa Bay has allowed an NFL-worst 298.9 passing yards per game, which means Drew Brees and company will most likely go off in this matchup, especially after they put up nine points against the Falcons last week. Smith had just one catch for 13 yards in his return from injury against Atlanta and could see an additional workload against the pass-funnel Bucs defense.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Marquise Brown, Ravens vs. Texans (DraftKings $5,600 | FanDuel $5,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brown has been a steady deep threat for Lamar Jackson and is coming off of a four-catch, 80-yard performance that included a touchdown last week. If you think the Texans can hang with the Ravens, Brown’s role is solidified, and his connection with Jackson is clear. While the rookie has only28 just passes this season, his 16.2 yards per catch shows off his explosiveness.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jamison Crowder, Jets at Redskins (DraftKings $5,700 | FanDuel $6,500)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the past two weeks, Crowder has posted solid stat lines as Sam Darnold’s top target (9-83-1 at Miami, 5-81-1 vs. the Giants). While he’s been a steady source of cheap fantasy points across the industry, the way in which he’s accumulated those stats has been frustrating. Darnold tends to target Crowder early and often, but then he tends to disappear in the second half. Expect Crowder to continue his strong recent play in an exploitable matchup against the Redskins, and if he can put together a full game of production, he could break the slate.</p>

      <h3>Week 11 NFL DFS Picks: TE sleepers, values</h3>
      <p>
        <b>O.J. Howard, Buccaneers vs. Saints (DraftKings $3,600 | FanDuel $5,300)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the “tight ends against Arizona” storyline is always fun to mention, Howard saw a season-high seven targets and finally found the end zone against the Cardinals last week. In what could be a shootout against the Saints, expect Jameis Winston to look his way as he attempts to build off of his Week 10 performance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mike Gesicki, Dolphins vs. Bills (DraftKings $3,500 | FanDuel $5,100)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gesicki let down everyone that rostered him last week, catching three-of-six targets for 28 yards against the Colts. Since Miami’s receiving corpsis depleted and DeVante Parker (who saw 10 targets last week) will likely have to deal with Bills corner Tre’Davious White on the outside, Gesicki is a strong tournament option at lower presumed ownership than in Week 10.</p>

      <h3>Week 11 NFL DFS values: D/ST sleepers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Miami Dolphins vs. Bills (DraftKings $2,500 | FanDuel $3,600)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This seems scary, but you can get some serious salary relief by rostering this defense that has allowed 16 and 12 points, respectively, in its past two games (against the Jets and Colts). It’s worth mentioning that the Dolphins picked off three passes in Indy, and Josh Allen isn’t exactly someone who is known to take care of the football.</p>
      <p>
        <b>New Orleans Saints at Buccaneers (DraftKings $2,900 | FanDuel $4,800)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of not taking care of the football, rostering any defense against turnover-prone Jameis Winston is never a bad idea due to the potential for a pick-six or scoop-and-score. Even if this game shoots out, the Saints could realistically have a defensive touchdown.</p>
