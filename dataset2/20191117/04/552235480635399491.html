      <h1>Boris Johnson ignores campaign trail jeers as he pulls of fake boos mind trick</h1>
      <h2>John Niven can't believe the Tory leader's ability to shrug off criticism and his ability to have a laser-like focus on any tiny positive.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Niven, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-niven/</a></address>
      <p>Most writers and ­musicians I know tend to react to ­criticism in much the same way.</p>
      <p>If they read 10 good reviews of their work, they will think to themselves, “Oh, these people are obviously all idiots. They haven’t figured out I’m a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/farage-pact-tories-killer-20863229">charlatan</a> yet.”</p>
      <p>It is the one bad review that will stick with them, that will trouble them in the night, that will make them think, “God, the game’s up, they’ve finally got my number.”</p>
      <p>This week, as I’ve been watching <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/appalling-legacy-austerity-should-make-20884686">Boris Johnson</a> on his nationwide walkabout, it’s occurred to me how very different politicians are from artists. They seem to be wired up in the completely opposite fashion.</p>
      <p>Johnson seems to be able to receive the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derek-stillie-reveals-death-threats-20888604">most furious criticism imaginable</a> and yet he manages to ignore it completely and focus on the odd tiny piece of praise.</p>
      <p>You can watch almost any clip of his public wanderings and see the same thing. An angry person will be shouting abuse directly at him, telling him how awful he is.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Behind that person will be another half-a-dozen folk, all booing and jeering.</p>
      <p>But what will <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/appalling-legacy-austerity-should-make-20884686">Johnson</a> focus on? With laser-sharp precision he’ll find the one guy 30 yards away who is giving him a thumbs up (and let’s face it, this guy was probably signalling to a friend somewhere behind Johnson) and give him a cheerful wave.</p>
      <p>Dominic Cummings famously defended <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/farage-pact-tories-killer-20863229">Brexit</a> by telling a gathering of reporters that they needed to “get out of London and go and talk to people who’re not rich <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/farage-pact-tories-killer-20863229">Remainers</a> ”.</p>
      <p>Well, this week Johnson followed that advice. The result? He was abused across half the country, from Somerset to Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>In ­Stainforth, Yorkshire, a woman told him: “I’m not very happy talking to you. You’ve done nothing for us,” before striding off, ignoring Johnson’s outstretched hand.</p>
      <p>Over in Fishlake, in a community centre, a man screamed at Johnson: “Everyone’s in poverty. The whole country’s a joke. Kids are living in the streets. Sort it out.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-everything-you-20880939">Prime Minister</a> might have hoped things would go better further south. He was mistaken.</p>
      <p>A chorus of boos and jeers greeted him as he arrived at a school in Taunton. People yelled “shame on you” in the streets of Wells.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A visit to a bakery in Glastonbury was cancelled after word leaked that he was coming and hundreds of protestors began to assemble. Johnson ran away and hastily ­organised a “surprise” visit to another bakery, six miles away.</p>
      <p>Just last month, the shambling Honey Monster in a suit had to be whisked out of a hospital in Cambridge by the back door after it became apparent that many NHS staff were more interested in getting an impromptu blood sample out of him than they were in shaking his hand.</p>
      <p>He has to flee in other countries, skipping a press conference in Luxembourg when it became clear that the traditional angry mob which now seems to greet him everywhere had already gathered.</p>
      <p>It does strike you as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derek-stillie-reveals-death-threats-20888604">odd that a Tory</a> who signed up for nearly a decade of cuts to the emergency services, the NHS and education would choose to visit disaster zones, hospitals and schools.</p>
      <p>You’d think that, with an election less than a month away, he’d be trying to gather some nice PR clips by going places he’d be welcomed.</p>
      <p>But that would restrict <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/appalling-legacy-austerity-should-make-20884686">Johnson’s wanderings</a> to the boardrooms of merchant banks and far-right meetings. (I was going to say “and to his parents’ house”, but it seems that much of Johnson’s own family cannot stand him, so maybe even that’s not such a safe bet.)</p>
      <p>How does he cope? What mental ­gymnastics are required to allow him to convince himself that he’s popular and beloved?</p>
      <p>Maybe he’ll start doing what Trump does – keep drilling down until he finds the right audience.</p>
      <p>After he was booed at a baseball game in Washington, and again at UFC fights in New York, Trump kept going to sporting events until he found a safe space where he would be cheered – a football game in Alabama.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Of course, as long as they were a Republican, Alabama would cheer for an actual sex offender. After all, this is the state that nearly elected Roy Moore, who denies that he sexually assaulted teenage girls.</p>
      <p>What would be the equivalent for Johnson in the UK? Well, there’s the Chelsea Flower Show, but that’s not until May. At the rate he’s going, if he’s somehow still in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-everything-you-20880939">10 Downing Street</a> by then, it’s a fair bet that, even in that bastion of ­conservatism, someone might offer to ram a bunch of geraniums right up his safe space.</p>
      <p>We live in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-everything-you-20880939">hope.</a></p>
