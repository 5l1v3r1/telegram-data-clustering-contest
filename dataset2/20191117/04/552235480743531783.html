      <h1>Price cuts for Tartan Army veterans at Scotland games should be celebrated</h1>
      <h2>The Sunday Mail says that after the win over Cyprus the good news continued as SFA see sense over tickets.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mail Opinion, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mail-opinion/</a></address>
      <p>Justice is not something Scotland fans are particularly familiar with.</p>
      <p>Supporting the national side is more often than not a pastime to be endured rather than enjoyed.</p>
      <p>The most deserved and hard-worked-for victories are routinely snatched away in ever more heartbreaking circumstances.</p>
      <p>But just maybe last night’s 2-1 win over Cyprus marked a turning of the tide that will set us up for some of our biggest play-off games in 20 years.</p>
      <p>And another major cause for celebration today is that after an 18-month Sunday Mail campaign, the SFA has finally agreed to see sense and offer older supporters cut-price tickets for those crucial matches.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>More than anything, this is a victory for common sense, as the case for doing this couldn’t have been more clear cut.</p>
      <p>Many of the fans who’ll benefit are people, often on very low incomes, who have loyally supported the team for generations.</p>
      <p>When you consider the results over the years, there is a strong argument that such dedication should be rewarded with free entry to Hampden for life and some sort of medal.</p>
      <p>But this isn’t just about altruism.</p>
      <p>The truth is that the SFA has been shooting itself in the foot with its rigid ticketing policy.</p>
      <p>We revealed in October that empty Hampden seats for five home Euro 2020 qualifiers has cost Scotland’s game more than £4million.</p>
      <p>Just 127,969 fans had turned up for those matches out of a potential 259,330 – the equivalent of just 49 per cent capacity.</p>
      <p>That is money that could be paying for the youth academies and training grounds the next generation of stars so badly need.</p>
      <p>Cutting prices for people who will otherwise struggle to afford to go to matches is a great way to fill the stadium.</p>
      <p>It also helps create the sort of atmosphere that every fan wants to see Scotland play in – and the sort of atmosphere that inspire a team to win.</p>
      <p>So if there is one thing the SFA should be focused on, it is making sure that every single Scotland game is played in front of a full house.</p>
      <p>Today’s decision will mean fans over 65 should be able to pick up affordable tickets for Nations League play-off matches in March 2020 that will give Steve Clarke’s squad the chance to get us to a major tournament for the first time since 1998.</p>
      <p>The move has been backed by everyone from Age Scotland to former First Minister Henry McLeish.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail has done its bit – let’s hope the team can make it worth our while.</p>
