      <h1>FiveThirtyEight’s Updated Playoff Prediction After Oklahoma’s Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:50:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>FiveThirtyEight’s prediction for the College Football Playoff has updated following Oklahoma’s win over previously-undefeated Baylor in Waco on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Week 12 has now seen two undefeated teams go down, as Minnesota lost to Iowa and the Bears fell to the Sooners.</p>
      <p>The computer projections have updated as a result.</p>
      <p>Here’s the latest top four, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-college-football-predictions/">from FiveThirtyEight</a>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Oklahoma is now the first team out at No. 5, given a 35 percent chance. Oregon is next up at 32 percent, followed by Utah (27 percent), Alabama (13 percent) and Penn State (13 percent).</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be released on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>We’ll have a much better idea of the playoff picture then.</p>
