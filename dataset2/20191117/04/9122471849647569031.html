      <h1>Jalen Hurts Had A Great Postgame Quote After Oklahoma’s Comeback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:44:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Jalen Hurts had his worst game as Oklahoma’s quarterback, and did some serious damage to his Heisman Trophy chances tonight. Ultimately, he and the Sooners found a way to win tonight’s game at previously undefeated Baylor.</p>
      <p>Hurts had a pair of fumbles and an interception on the day, helping <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/baylor-blowing-out-oklahoma-first-half-2019">Baylor jump out to a 28-3 lead</a> in the second quarter. Any good football fan knows that particular lead <a href="https://twitter.com/AtlantaFalcons/status/1195917710917537792">isn’t a safe one</a>, though.</p>
      <p>The Sooners stormed back, outscoring Baylor 24-0 in the second half. Gabe Brkic hit a go-ahead field goal with 1:45 left in the game, and an interception of Charlie Brewer by Nik Bonitto sealed a <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=401112082">34-31 win</a>.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts was so nervous that he couldn’t bear to watch the end of the game. After he was <a href="https://thespun.com/big-12/oklahoma-sooners/video-jalen-hurts-maria-taylor-share-funny-moment-after-win">flagged down by Maria Taylor</a> for a post-game interview, he owned up to his in-game mistakes, but he was mostly happy with the team effort that allowed Oklahoma to come back and win the game.</p>

      <p>With the win, Oklahoma moves to 9-1, and stays alive in the College Football Playoff race. Baylor drops to 9-1, and will likely tumble from the No. 13 spot in next week’s CFP rankings.</p>
      <p>Given the fact that OU was only No. 10 this week, it doesn’t seem as if the selection committee is very impressed with the Big 12 as a whole, but with Alabama losing Tua Tagovailoa, and losses for Baylor and another previously undefeated team, Minnesota, this week, the No. 4 spot is wide open.</p>
      <p>If OU can run the table and impress the committee, and likely get some help in the Pac-12 and SEC, the Sooners have a shot.</p>
