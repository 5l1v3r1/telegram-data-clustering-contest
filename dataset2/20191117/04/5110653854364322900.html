      <h1>Week 11 Fantasy WR Rankings: Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs look to bounce back in tough matchups</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:22:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:22</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>The Week 11 WR rankings have a similar theme to our QB rankings -- great matchups. It makes sense, of course, but it's still a nice reprieve from the weeks of having to make too many tough decisions. Most of the stud wide receivers have no question marks next to their names this week and qualify as "must-starts." It's only when we get into the WR3 conversation that it gets a little tricky.</p>
      <p>So, let's dip right down into the nitty-gritty of the trickier decisions this week. Maybe it's JuJu Smith-Schuster (@ Browns), who we discussed at length last week. Even in a game that Pittsburgh moved the ball pretty well, it was James Washington leading the way in receiving in Week 10. JuJu isn't a must-start in Week 11, but you probably have to play him on Thursday Night Football -- and the same is true for Odell Beckham Jr. (vs. Steelers) in the same game.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Smith-Schuster is right next to two much less exciting names in our initial rankings: Auden Tate and Zach Pascal. SN Fantasy's Matt Lutovsky actually had to choose two of those three in Week 10, and he opted to sit JuJu. Obviously the matchups have changed, but who would've thought that made any sort of sense before the season (JuJuoutscored Tate by 0.8 points, for the record). Now, it's intriguing to consider Tate against a bad Oakland pass defense or Pascal if he's still Indy's No. 1 wideout. JuJu probably has a slight upside edge, but maybe he doesn't have the upside he once did without Antonio Brown and with Mason Rudolph throwing him passes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>There's also the case of whether you should ride the hot hand in the 30s portion of our rankings. Christian Kirk just had a hat trick of touchdowns in Week 10, including two bombs, but now comes up against the 49ers and probably Richard Sherman. That's a 180-degree flip in matchup and might be enough to consider other options over Kirk, even though we realize how hard it is to sit a player coming off three scores (and even harder if he was on your bench last week).</p>

      <p>As we continue down, we havemore juxtapositions -- a touchdown threat in DeVante Parker right next to his Week 11 opponent and reception wizard Cole Beasley. There are Jets teammates, Demaryius Thomas and Robby Anderson -- Thomas coming off a good Week 10 but Anderson obviously the better big-play threat. Within a few spots of each other are a great matchup, Alex Erickson (@ Raiders), compared to a terrible matchup for a No. 1 WR, Alshon Jeffery (vs. Patriots). (<i>Update: Jeffery is out.)</i> Because of how easy the top of the rankings are this week, you might spend more time than usual on that final lineup decision.</p>

      <p>It's also that time of year when the fantasy playoffs draw near. Know your status in the playoff race. If you need a couple of big wins, maybe it's time to bet on upside. If there's a total points crown, chase that with upside, too. But if you just want to avoid totally terrible weeks, you go with the floors of players like Beasley and Thomas. While your fantasy roster won't actually realize that it has good or bad momentum (besides the real-life momentum for the individual players), it will never hurt your own mood to keep putting up good weeks regardless of your place in the standings.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> We'll continue to update these rankings all week, so check back for the latest and individual player analysis.</p>
