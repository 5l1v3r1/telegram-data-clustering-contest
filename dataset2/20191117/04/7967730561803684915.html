      <p>Ellyse Perry's earliest memories of being a spectator were attending SCG Tests and watching the old Mercantile Mutual/ING one-dayers on TV. Mike Hussey hitting the sponsor's sign to win $200,000 at the WACA; Billy Connolly spruiking the sponsor in the ad breaks. The advertising messages were hitting hard, but not as hard as the impression cricket was making on a certain 11-year-old.</p>
      <p>Watching men's cricket, that is. Women's cricket might as well have not existed back then. It wasn't on TV or even in the papers. At primary school, Perry played in the boys' sides. She can't recall any barriers to that happening.</p>
      <p>"It was really easy to play. I loved playing in the boys' competition. Some of my best mates today are boys I played with at school. I never felt different. I always felt part of it. I always found it to be accessible. I probably didn't become aware of women's cricket until I went to high school and started making a few representative sides."</p>
      <p>Two months after turning 16, Perry was playing in the NSW women's under-19s. Six months later, she was in the Australian ODI side – having bypassed senior selection for NSW. And then, aged 17 and three months, she was picked in the Test XI.</p>
      <p>Perry was selected to open the bowling and bat at No.7 in a one-off Test against England, and she'd do it on cricket holy ground – Don Bradman's ashes are scattered on and around the oval that bears his name in Bowral. To say Perry was excited about her debut is akin to saying Bradman was a good batsman.</p>
      <p>"It was such a buzz. I absolutely loved it. I remember being really anxious after being selected in the team. I was so excited."</p>
      <blockquote>I do know it means our caps are cleaner than the boys' caps<cite>Ellyse Perry on whether having fewer women's Tests makes them more precious</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The debutants – Perry, Leonie Coleman, Kirsten Pike and Emma Sampson – were presented their baggy greens by Australia's most capped Test player, 20-Test wicketkeeper Christina Matthews. "So that was amazing," Perry says. "The atmosphere and the buzz around Bowral Oval was awesome. That it was a village/community ground added to that. It almost had an English village feel to it. It was almost a stereotypical Test match cricket atmosphere."</p>
      <p>So excited was Perry, she didn't take in anything Matthews said. "I think my eyes just glazed over. I remember afternoon tea being delicious!"</p>

      <p>Perry made 21 and six and took three wickets on debut at Bowral. The longer figures reveal that she didn't look out of place at all; she batted for almost an hour and a half in the first dig, and her 1-17 from 13 overs was the best Australian return as England ran down the 142-run target with six wickets in hand.</p>
      <p>Like Steve Smith, Perry served an apprenticeship down the order – she batted at No.10 in one early Test, for example – before moving up to No.4. Unlike Smith, Perry was a bowler of the highest class from the start.</p>
      <p>Was the new girl made to feel welcome? "Oh, I felt really welcome. And it was a really small dressing room, so we had to be nice to each other. I loved the sense of being exhausted at the end of a day's play. And then doing it again the next day. Epic."</p>
      <p>The Australian women have the camaraderie caper well and truly covered. It was on show at a playful training session in Adelaide in 2014 ahead of a Twenty20 against the West Indies. It was an optional session, but all the stars were there: Meg Lanning, Alex Blackwell, Alyssa Healy, Megan Schutt and Perry – on her 24th birthday. Training to play for Australia is a serious business, but the women didn't let that stop them having fun while they did so. The team's fellowship is fanned by the fact that the players come together relatively infrequently, so they make the most of it when they do.</p>
      <p>For Perry, Tests are "epic". "You cherish every Test that you play. I know every Test that I've played and I remember them."</p>
      <p>Some are easier to remember than others; the player-of-the-match display in Perth in January 2014, for example. In this Test, Perry showed she was no downhill skier to take 3-41 and 5-38 and make 71 and 31, top-scoring in both innings of a match Australia lost by 61 runs. The following year in England, she took 6-32 – the sixth-best figures by an Australian woman in Tests – but this time Australia won. At the 2019 Women's Ashes, Perry was voted the player of the series – she was the leading scorer with 378 runs, with a 94.50 average, and the top of the leading wicket-takers of the series with 15 wickets at under 13.</p>
      <p>Ten years after her first Test, she'd played only another six. Does playing fewer Tests make the women's baggy greens even more precious?</p>

      <p>"I don't know about that," she says. "I do know it means our caps are cleaner than the boys' caps."</p>
      <p>Perry talks of a "new hope" for women's Tests now that the rise in player and fan numbers has been achieved.</p>

      <p>She uses the North Sydney Oval Test in November 2017 as an example of why more Tests can and should be played – and not just against England. (Australia and England are, at the time of writing, the only nations still playing women's Tests – the most recent match among the other nations was India v South Africa in 2014.) The day/night Test in North Sydney – the first ticketed women's Test in Australia – drew more than 12,000 spectators and was the centrepiece of a series that Cricket Australia said had a "viewership" of more than four million.</p>
      <p>"The amount of people that came to that game, the way it was covered, the interest … it would be really nice to do that against the other nations as well," Perry says.</p>
      <p>It would be nice to make 213 not out against the other nations as well; Perry's score for that 374-ball innings (27 fours and a six) is the highest made by an Australian woman.</p>
      <p>After the match, which was drawn, Perry said the rise of the women's game was the highlight of her career.</p>
      <p>Really? Not posting a record Test score, or winning a World Cup or Ashes series?</p>
      <p>Nope. She wasn't virtue signalling or caught up in a heady moment either, because seven months later, being interviewed for this book, she still felt the same way.</p>
      <p>"For me, it's the way the women's game has been transformed in the 10 or so years since I started. When I started, there were no contracts. Everyone had jobs. Now it's become more professional. The games are often televised. It's just given so many more opportunities for these athletes. And it's coincided with the growth of women's sports in general. So yeah, that's been the highlight for me so far."</p>
