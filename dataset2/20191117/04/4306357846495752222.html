      <h1>Man United ‘weighing up’ January move to sign quality 19-year-old – report</h1>
      <h2>Man United are interested in signing Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund in January, say reports</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Manchester United are pondering a January move to try and sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/15/manchester-united-transfer-jadon-sancho-dortmund">Guardian</a> is reporting that the Red Devils have already identified the talented 19-year-old as a summer transfer target, but they could make their move in the new year after having been alerted to his “troubles” at Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The teenager was reportedly fined and dropped by Dortmund last month after being late to report back to training after England duty.</p>
      <p>Sancho is widely regarded as one of Europe’s most exciting young attacking talents and it remains to be seen whether he could end up leaving the Bundesliga club in January.</p>
      <p>The same story says that Manchester United could be set to face competition from the likes of Real Madrid and Liverpool FC if they do try and make a move to sign the teenager in January.</p>
      <p>Sancho has been in good form for Dortmund so far this season, scoring three goals and making five assists in nine Bundesliga games for the club.</p>
      <p>He has also made one assist in four Champions League outings for the German side this season.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are thought to be on the lookout for some attacking reinforcements in January after the exits of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez in the summer.</p>
