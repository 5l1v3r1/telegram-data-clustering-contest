      <h1>New 16-Inch MacBook Pro's Keyboard Is Basically the Old System Prior to Butterfly-Switch</h1>
      <h2>iFixit did a tear-down of the new model.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:15:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Yeung</a></address>
      <p>For years, the butterfly-switch keyboard on <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple">Apple</a>‘s newer line of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-macbook-pro">MacBook Pros</a> plagued its users, leaving many fans of the tech giant deeply dissatisfied. With the recent launch of the new 16-inch model, Apple has promised to fix this longstanding issue, and tech website <i>iFixit </i>has now confirmed that the California-based tech firm has kept to its word.</p>
      <p>However, instead of developing a completely new system, Apple simply removed the problematic butterfly-switch mechanism by replacing it with its predecessor: the scissor-switch keyboard. Tearing down the new 16-inch model, <i>iFixit </i>says that in fact the new keyboard is so similar to its pre-butterfly cousin that the keys are basically interchangeable. Of course, the key caps themselves are also back to the thicker sizes offered previously, with more travel when tapped on. For many Apple enthusiasts, this is definitely great news.</p>
      <p>The new Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch model is now open for pre-orders, starting from $2,400 USD. Head over to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">Apple’s website</a> to learn more now.</p>
