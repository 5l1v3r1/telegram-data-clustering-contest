      <h1>DPD blasted as delivery driver fined £150 for rushing to sick wife in hospital</h1>
      <h2>Drivers are still being penalised despite the delivery giant claiming there had been a change in policy in wake of death of courier Don Lane.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Blackstock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-whistleblower-sacked-after-lifting-15277964">Parcel giant DPD</a> is still fining workers for being sick – despite saying it was dropping the controversial practice after one of its drivers died.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-whistleblower-sacked-after-lifting-15277964">delivery firm</a>, whose chief executive Dwain McDonald earns nearly £1million a year, faced a public backlash when courier Don Lane, 53, died after slipping into a coma in 2018.</p>
      <p>The diabetic driver had missed hospital appointments over fears he would be hit with a £150 penalty for failing to make work.</p>
      <p>McDonald said the firm would drop the fines and improve workers’ conditions.</p>

      <p>But nearly two years after Don’s death, drivers of its sister courier organisation, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-bosses-probe-over-claims-14995865">DPD Local</a>, are still being penalised if they are sick and need to get cover.</p>
      <p>Dad-of-four Mark Barnes, originally from Southampton but who worked with the company near Wakefield until last month, said he was outraged to be issued fines for being off work ill.</p>
      <p>He also said he was fined £300 after missing two days because his wife Rachel had an emergency operation and he rushed to be by her bedside in hospital.</p>
      <p>Mark, 34, who quit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-whistleblower-sacked-after-lifting-15277964">DPD</a> last month after working for them for four years, said: “They’ve been ruthless over enforcement of these fines.</p>
      <p>“I was already at work and had loaded up my van before I got a call to say an ambulance was taking my wife away.</p>
      <p>“There was no understanding from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-bosses-probe-over-claims-14995865">DPD depot</a> and the next month I was given two £150 fines.</p>

      <p>“In four years, I have received five or six <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tragic-dpd-driver-who-died-18787491">fines</a> for being unable to make work.</p>
      <p>“It’s never been for anything other than serious issues such as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tragic-dpd-driver-who-died-18787491">sickness or emergency childcare problems.</a></p>
      <p>“On top of the fine, you’re losing a day’s wages which means it’s a £300 fine in reality. It’s shameful.”</p>
      <p>The working practices facing couriers are the subject of Sorry We Missed You – a movie by filmmaker Ken Loach.</p>
      <p>Upon learning <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-bosses-probe-over-claims-14995865">DPD still fines drivers</a> , Don’s widow Ruth said: “They’ve not <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dpd-bosses-probe-over-claims-14995865">learned a thing</a>.”</p>
      <p>GMB Scotland senior organiser Louise Gilmour said: “DPD is a company that makes it up as they go along.</p>
      <p>“If they can put a cost or claw back on their drivers, then that’s what they will do. How many more shameful stories need to be exposed before our leaders at Westminster and Holyrood bring the likes of DPD to task?”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A DPD spokesman: “The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tragic-dpd-driver-who-died-18787491">old breach system</a> for self-employed drivers was scrapped altogether as part of our Driver Code and replaced with a clear and consistent points-based system to monitor service delivery and contract performance.</p>
      <p>“We will investigate what has happened in Mark’s case.”</p>
