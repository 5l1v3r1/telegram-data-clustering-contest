      <h1>Video: Jalen Hurts, Maria Taylor Share Funny Moment After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T04:28:24+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday night, the biggest game of the weekend – at least for the Big 12 – kicked off from Waco as No. 13 Baylor hosted No. 10 Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>The Bears jumped out to a 21-point halftime lead, but saw that lead evaporate over the final two quarters of play.</p>
      <p>The Sooners, who trailed 31-10 at halftime, pulled off one of the best comebacks of the season en route to a 34-31 win. Lincoln Riley’s squad might not have the best defense in the country, but as long as the team has star quarterback Jalen Hurts, it has a chance.</p>
      <p>Hurts called his own number to the tune of 27 carries and 42 pass attempts. He racked up over 400 yards of total offense and four touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Baylor couldn’t stop the Alabama transfer, but there was one person who could.</p>
      <p>ESPN reporter Maria Taylor made sure Hurts didn’t escape her grasp for a post-game interview.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>Of course, Hurts was likely scheduled to speak with reporters after the game, but he was little too fired up for an interview.</p>
      <p>Good for Maria Taylor to make sure he spoke after the game. Hurts delivered a great post-game interview, like he always does.</p>
      <p>With the win, Oklahoma improves to 9-1 on the season and keeps its College Football Playoff hopes alive.</p>
