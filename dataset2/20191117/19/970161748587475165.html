      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth</a> looked stony-faced today as she made her first public appearance since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s controversial interview.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York’s questioning on BBC Newsnight about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been described as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">‘nuclear explosion level bad’</a>.</p>
      <p>This morning, the Queen failed to raise a smile as she was photographed in the back of a chauffeur driven car, making her way back to Windsor after attending a Sunday church service.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed that Prince Andrew stands by his ‘car crash’ interview, with a BBC source saying he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ‘honesty and humility’.</p>
      <p>In his questioning on Saturday, the prince was grilled on allegations that Virginia Roberts – now named Virginia Giuffre –  was made to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002.</p>

      <p>Mrs Giuffre said she was trafficked when she was 17 and was forced into sexual encounters with the Duke in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.</p>
      <p>The prince ‘categorically’ denied having sex with her, but admitted he did not regret his relationship with the disgraced financier as it gave him the opportunity to meet people and help prepare for his role as a trade envoy.</p>

      <p>The royal also claimed he couldn’t have slept with Mrs Giuffre because he had taken daughter Princess Beatrice to a party at Pizza Express the day his accuser claimed it happened.</p>
      <p>He dismissed claims that he was sweating profusely during the nightclub encounter because he had a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">‘peculiar medical condition’</a> that meant he could not sweat, caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War.</p>
      <p>It was only because he had ‘done a number of things in the recent past’ that he was able to sweat again, he claimed.</p>
      <p>He said he knew it was ‘the wrong thing to do’ to stay at Epstein’s house in 2010 – two years after the sex offender’s first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution – but said it was ‘convenient’.</p>
      <p>A photograph of the prince and Mrs Giuffre has been widely shared in the press inside what is said to be the house of British socialite and Epstein’s girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, in Belgravia, London.</p>

      <p>Andrew told the BBC: ‘I have simply no recollection of the photograph ever being taken. I don’t remember ever going upstairs in the house’.</p>

      <p>When interviewer Emily Ms Maitlis pointed out that his arm appeared to be around her waist, the Duke of York said he ‘wasn’t entirely convinced’ this was the case’, but admitted ‘that is what I’d describe as me in the photograph’.</p>
      <p>The Duke said that, as a member of the Royal Family, he is ‘not one to hug’ or ‘display affection’ in public, adding that he was at a ‘loss to explain’ how the image came to be and if the ‘original was to ever be produced’ he could clarify.</p>
      <p>Referring to Epstein, who took his own life in his prison cell in August, the prince said: ‘Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.’</p>
