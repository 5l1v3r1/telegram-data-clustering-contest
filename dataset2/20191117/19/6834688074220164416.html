      <p>Switzerland-based Avaloq, a company that offers a standardized Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) or Software as a Service (SaaS) model to financial institutions and wealth management platforms, <a href="https://www.avaloq.com/en/-/acquisition-of-derivative-partners">revealed</a> recently that it has finalized its acquisition of Derivative Partners, which was first announced in July of this year.</p>
      <p>Derivatives Partners, a leading financial data provider, will reportedly retain all its current staff members and will continue to operate as an organizational entity.</p>
      <p>Avaloq Group CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juerg-hunziker-07a3b312/?locale=en_US">Juerg Hunziker</a> stated:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“We are delighted to have closed this significant acquisition, and I would like to thank the team at Derivative Partners for their utmost professionalism throughout the process. We are truly delighted to welcome them into the Avaloq Community, with our clients set to benefit from the firm’s extensive consulting capabilities and unparalleled know-how around structured products.” </i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Hunziker added:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“The acquisition highlights Avaloq’s strong market confidence and underpins our vision of reinventing the financial experience in a fully digitized, always-on and data-driven world through powerful data analytics.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Avaloq’s management says the acquisition will allow it to offer independent valuation, trading, and financial portfolio management to its new customers.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2000 in Zurich, Derivative Partners offers various solutions for structured financial products to over 40 industry participants, which includes private financial institutions, issuers, asset managers and exchanges.</p>
      <p>The company also specializes in determining regulatory requirements and portfolio management ratios. Additionally, Derivatives partners provides third-party valuation models and  quantitative support for trading and investment banking divisions. The company’s services also include life-cycle management, product governance, and media-related services.</p>
      <p>The financial terms of the acquisition have not been shared publicly.</p>
      <p>Avaloq recently announced that its online banking platform had gone live at Switzerland’s universal bank, Thurgauer Kantonalbank.</p>
