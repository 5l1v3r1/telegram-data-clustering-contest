      <p>Michelle Visage became the eighth celebrity to leave Strictly Come Dancing, leaving her co-stars stunned.</p>
      <p>The Drag Race star, 51, was previously hailed as the potential winner of the BBC dancing competition, so her exit came as a shock to many viewers.</p>
      <p>She and Giovanni Pernice landed in the bottom two with YouTuber Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard, meaning both couples had to dance again.</p>
      <p>Michelle and Giovanni performed their couples choice dance, which was street commercial, to Madonna's iconic Vogue.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Saffron and AJ Quickstepped to Beverley Knight's Marvellous Party in a bid to impress the judges.</p>
      <p>Craig Revel Horwood deliberated over the decision, admitting that he found it difficult to pick who to save.</p>

      <p>Eventually, however, he said: "I'm having a really difficult time with myself over this. This doesn’t normally happen to me. I normally make a very quick, instant decision. This has been really, really difficult.</p>
      <p>"One couple took all the notes on board and one couple were better. And the couple I’ve decided I would like to save is save is Saffron and AJ."</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabuse also decided to save Saffron and AJ after saying that they had seen "two brilliant dances".</p>
      <p>Finally, Bruno Tonioli agreed, saying that Saffron and AJ's dance was "on the money".</p>

      <p>"Ahh, it’s so competitive its unbelievable," he said. "First I want to congratulate both of you. You both really raised the game tonight – much, much better than Saturday.</p>
      <p>"And it’s very hard to decide but based on what I saw somebody I really thought nailed the dance. Right on the money. Saffron and AJ."</p>
      <p>Head Judge Shirley Ballas said that she agreed with her fellow judges and would have sent Michelle and Giovanni home.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Michelle branded her experience "amazing" and that she couldn't have done the show without her pro partner Giovanni.</p>

      <p>"At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I’d be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner," Michelle said. "To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that’s why I did what I did. I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about Giovanni, she said: "Obviously I couldn’t have done it without him. He has been so amazing, so transformative. Just my rock and my best friend throughout this entire competition. He could take it as much as he could dish it, and I needed somebody like that. I’m going to miss seeing him every day. I would never have wanted to do this with anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Giovanni added: "You are wonderful. We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we’v e done everything but I’ve loved every single second. I think you are inspirational and we did this dance and wanted to send a message.</p>
      <p>"You are a phenomenal lady and I am so proud of everything we’ve done. I’m here to say thank you, thank you, thank you."</p>
