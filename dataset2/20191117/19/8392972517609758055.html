      <h1>Strictly Come Dancing: Michelle Visage voted out in Week 9</h1>
      <h2>She and Giovanni Pernice lost out to Saffron Barker</h2>

      <p>Drag Race star Michelle Visage's wild ride on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> has come to an end <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-viewers-hail-blackpool-show-a-triumph/">in Blackpool</a>.</p>
      <p>The US TV personality, 51, became the ninth celebrity to leave the BBC One competition after she lost out in the dance off to YouTuber Saffron Barker.</p>
      <p>Michelle and pro partner Giovanni Pernice found themselves rock bottom of the leaderboard on Saturday night, despite picking up a respectable 32 points for their couple's choice - a street commercial to Vogue by Madonna.</p>
      <p>Judges and viewers at home via social media made it clear how much they appreciated the routine's bold theme, but it seems that did not translate into votes.</p>

      <p>Craig Revel Horwood <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-viewers-hail-blackpool-show-a-triumph/">remarked yesterday evening</a>: "I loved the high styling of it and I loved the sentiment of it."</p>
      <p>And head judge Shirley Ballas added: "A dance is an expression to music and you used it fully. I also loved the sentiment."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Saffron and her partner AJ Pritchard racked up a score of 35 to finish fourth out of the seven acts remaining.</p>
      <p>That, too, was not enough to keep them safe from potential elimination and demonstrates how every point counts as the contest reaches the later stages.</p>

      <p>And although the standard of performances was very high for the annual bonanza in the north west, there was controversy elsewhere when Karim Zeroual was denied a perfect score.</p>
      <p>Many fans felt the presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-viewers-slam-judges-scoring-as-they-claim-karim-zeroual-was-robbed-of-perfect-40/">had been 'robbed' of four 10s</a>.</p>

      <p>Veteran pro partner Anton du Beke will probably have fond memories of this trip to Blackpool, though. The 53-year-old <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-anton-du-beke-gets-his-first-ever-10/">achieved his first 10 in 17 years</a> on the show!</p>
      <p>And following a dramatic show, it seems the show's stars made the most of unwinding before another week of hard training. According to a tabloid report, the post-show party in Blackpool for some <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-stars-share-hilarious-photos-as-they-enjoy-night-of-partying-in-blackpool/">continued until 5am</a>.</p>

      <p>Some of Michelle's fans feel she lost her place in the competition because viewers didn't understand the significance and importance of Vogue-ing, which is so rooted within the gay community.</p>
      <p>They argued that her routine didn't contain enough technical dance moves.</p>
