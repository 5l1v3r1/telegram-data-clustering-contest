      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Renault (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/RENA.PA">RENA.PA</a>) will have soon drawn up a shortlist of candidates for chief executive officer but there is no rush, the French carmaker’s chairman told a German newspaper.</p>
      <p>Renault ousted chief executive Thierry Bollore in October as the carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/7201.T">7201.T</a>) have tried to rekindle their relationship after the arrest of the alliance’s former head Carlos Ghosn.</p>
      <p>“If we select a person by the end of the year, all the better. If not, it’s not a bad thing,” Jean-Dominique Senard told Seuddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He praised Renault’s finance director, Clotilde Delbos, who took over as interim CEO.</p>
      <p>Bollore had been close to Ghosn and had strained relations with Nissan’s previous boss.</p>
      <p>Appointing new faces at the helm of Renault could help draw a line under almost a year of turmoil and revive cooperation between two carmakers once seen as destined to a full merger.</p>
      <p>Senard did not rule out reducing Renault’s stake in Nissan, which he said the Japanese firm had long demanded. The French company holds 43% of Nissan’s shares.</p>
      <p>“Things are not written for all eternity,” Senard said. “However, a reduction in shares must make sense.”</p>
      <p>French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that the search was ongoing for a new CEO and that he favoured selecting a professional from the automobile sector.</p>
