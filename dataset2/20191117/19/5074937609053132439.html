      <h1>Okaikwei North Assembly cut sod for four projects</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:00:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Francis Cofie, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 17, GNA – The Okaikwei North Municipal Assembly has performed separate sod-cutting ceremonies for work to start on four projects in the area to enhance development.</p>
      <p>These are the construction of a clinic at Christian Village, a police station at Lapaz Bambolino, an 18-unit classroom at Akweteyman and an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Centre at the Fadama Cluster of Schools.</p>
      <p>Mr Ishmael Ashietey, the Greater Accra Regional Minister, at the sod-cutting for the police station project, said it was part of government’s efforts to provide security to the people, which would be extended to other communities.</p>
      <p>He said by this effort the incidence of crime would be reduced for the citizens to go about their normal duties without fear.</p>
      <p>Mr Ashietey commended the Assembly for the number of projects it had initiated, saying; “this attests to the fact that it has the development of the Municipality at heart.”</p>
      <p>He urged residents to obtain permits before putting up structures, especially for business purposes, to avoid their property being demolished.</p>
      <p>“The Assembly has the right and the mandate within the coded law to determine the use of lands under its jurisdiction.”</p>
      <p>Mr Boye Laryea, the Okaikwei North Municipal Chief Executive, said all the four projects had been awarded on contract and work would soon start, and expected to be completed within six months.</p>
      <p>He said the Assembly had been receiving support from residents and the two Members of Parliament for the area; Mr Fuseini Issah, Okaikwei North, and Mr Patrick Buamah, Okaikwei Central, and that, with a united front, it would meet its development aspirations.</p>
      <p>At the Meet-the-Press after the sod-cutting, Mr Laryea said contracts had been awarded for the rehabilitation of deplorable roads in the Municipality and work would soon start to ease the challenges residents face.</p>
      <p>Mr Laryea asked the residents to be patient with the young Assembly as it was in the process of tackling all developmental challenges and urged them not to condone wrongdoing by shielding those who broke the law.</p>
      <p>Mrs Victoria Enim-Nyarko, the Municipal Finance Officer, said the revenue target for 2019 was GH¢5.2 million and so far it had realised GH¢3,381,557.84, which represented about 65 per cent.</p>
