      <p>Nov. 17 (UPI) -- Brother-sister entertainers Donny and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Marie_Osmond/?tps=1">Marie Osmond</a> ended their 11-year residency in Las Vegas this weekend.</p>
      <p>"In the world of theater, a lamp is always placed on stage after a performance. The ghost light serves to dimly illuminate the stage so that it's never completely dark. ⁣⁣The curtain came down on the final DonnyandMarie performance in Vegas tonight, but our ghost light continues to glow at @flamingovegas. (The flamingo is only appropriate, right? ⁣⁣That's a wrap, everybody! VivaLasVegas," Donny, 61, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B49QJohn43K/?utm_source=ig_embed">captioned</a> an Instagram photo of a lamp on an empty stage on Saturday.</p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/donny-and-marie-thrill-fans-as-las-vegas-strip-residency-ends-1894703/">hand at the show</a> were three fellow hosts from <i>The Talk</i> on CBS: Sheryl Underwood, Eve and Carrie Ann Inaba,</p>
      <p>Marie, 60, <a href="https://twitter.com/marieosmond/status/1196007590397800449">shared</a> on Twitter a photo of her with her 61-year-old brother on stage for their final performance at the Flamingo Las Vegas hotel and casino.</p>
      <p>"Last show tonight <span dir="ltr">@FlamingoVegas</span> Thank you for 11 great years... Good Night Everyone!" she tweeted, along with a kissy face emoji.</p>
      <p>People.com <a href="https://people.com/music/donny-osmond-marie-osmond-end-11-year-las-vegas-residency/">said</a> Donny and Marie both fought back tears throughout the show.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to miss you. I love you," Marie told her brother.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to miss you, too," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'll see you at Christmas," Marie teased.</p>
      <p>The concert ended with the pair hugging.</p>
