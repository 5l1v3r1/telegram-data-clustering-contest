      <h1>Mulled wine banned from council's Christmas event over fears it could encourage street drinkers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:53:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Mulled wine has been banned from a council's Christmas markets over fear it could encourage street drinking. </p>
      <p>A trader has been banned from selling the festive tipple at a town's festive lights, branding the council as "anti-Christmas".</p>
      <p>Glenn Davison applied for a temporary licence to serve the seasonal drink from his pop-up stall at the event in Castleford, on Tuesday. But Wakefield Council blocked the bid over concerns about street drinkers taking advantage of the sale.</p>
      <p>"I don't think street drinkers will be interested in the mulled wine I'm selling," Mr Davison told the BBC.</p>
      <p>"[It] is very weak. It's about 2 per cent, so you'd have to drink about six glasses to feel any effect."</p>
      <p>Parts of the town centre are covered by a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO), which was put in place in 2017 to stop anti-social behaviour related to street drinking.</p>
      <p>The order allows police to issue on-the-spot fines to offenders and to seize alcohol. At a licensing hearing on Friday, police said the stall would be too close to where the PSPO is in force, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported.</p>
      <p>They said no access-restrictions would be in place around the stalls, unlike at other Christmas markets where visitors can only drink alcohol within a gated area.</p>
      <p>Mr Davison, a former winner of TV show Come Dine With Me from Hull, said he will still be at the event, selling non-alcoholic mulled wine.</p>
