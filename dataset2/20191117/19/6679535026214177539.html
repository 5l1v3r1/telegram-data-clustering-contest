      <h1>TNCC likely to seek a few Mayoral seats in civic polls</h1>

      <p>The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee would seek Mayoral seats from its alliance partners in the upcoming local body polls, besides other seats that would be identified through discussions, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the party’s election committee met to decide the modalities to fight the local body polls. “The district presidents are touring the districts and getting feedback from the cadre. Those who are interested in fighting the polls could submit their applications to the DCC (District Congress Committee) presidents from November 20 to 23,” Mr. Alagiri said.</p>
      <p>When asked if the party would seek Mayoral seats from the DMK, the TNCC president said the allocation of seats would have to be decided on after a meeting with alliance partners once the elections are announced. The Congress will be seeking Mayoral seats as well, he added.</p>
      <p>“Just like how money played a big role in the recently-concluded bypolls to two Assembly constituencies [Nanguneri and Vikravandi], the ruling party will try to influence the local body polls through money power,” he said.</p>
