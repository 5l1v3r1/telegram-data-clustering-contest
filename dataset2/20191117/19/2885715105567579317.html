      <p>The state <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> Sunday said the presence of its leaders, especially former CM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a>, at an event to mark the death anniversary of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a> founder Bal Thackeray demonstrated that Hindutva still binds the two saffron parties.</p>
      <p>Hitting out at the NCP and Congress which are trying to form a government in the state along with the Sena, the state BJP said that what the NCP-Congress was doing was political opportunism.</p>
      <p>Asked if Fadnavis’ gesture amounts to the BJP keeping its options open on government formation with Sena, a BJP source said, “There are no permanent friends or enemies. Yet, the BJP will never compromise its self respect.”</p>
      <p>“Fadnavis believes that political differences should not come in the way on such occasions. The BJP has always held Balasaheb (Thackeray) in high esteem,” the source said. According to a BJP leader, “Fadnavis has always displayed greater sense of accommodating allies. This was evident in his politics in the last five years.”</p>
      <p>Being politically correct should not be termed a sign of political compulsion or vulnerability, a former BJP minister said. BJP leaders believe the Shiv Sena will have to mend the broken fences.</p>
