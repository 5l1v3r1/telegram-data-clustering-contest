      <h1>Piers Morgan vows to repair Rebekah Vardy's image after Coleen Rooney drama</h1>
      <h2>Coleen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of lifting stories from her private Instagram account and selling them to the press</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:31:45+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Piers Morgan has revealed how he promised to repair Rebekah Vardy's public image after the Coleen Rooney scandal.</p>
      <p>Coleen accused Rebekah, who is married to Jamie Vardy, of lifting stories from her private <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account and selling them to the press, something she denies.</p>
      <p>It made Rebekah a national laughing stock but her pal and Good Morning Britain host Piers has vowed to come to her rescue.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for today's <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/index.html">Event magazine</a> , Piers said: "I walked into the Vardy box at Leicester's King Power Stadium, hugged Rebekah, now eight months pregnant with her fifth child, and announced: 'I'm here to repair your public image!'</p>

      <p>"'Oh Christ,' she chuckled, 'that's all I need' 'You OK?' I asked, more seriously. 'Just about,' she replied, 'but it's been very hard, for me and the whole family, especially with the baby coming.' I can imagine."</p>
      <p>Piers has refused to take sides between the former friends but said Coleen's public reveal of the drama was "ill-advised".</p>
      <p>He continued: "Whatever the truth, and Rebekah's just as emphatic - and convincingly so - in private with her denials that she's the leaker, Coleen's decision to humiliate her friend at that stage of a pregnancy was very ill-advised.</p>

      <p>"Indeed, the disgusting abuse Rebekah's received as a result, including death threats, has been so bad that Robbie Williams today attacked Coleen for playing a 'dangerous game', provoking a 'level of shame' that could be 'suicide-causing'."</p>
      <p>The rift between Rebekah and Coleen has not been healed since Rooney turned sleuth and accused her former friend of spreading stories about her, in a scandal that was dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that Coleen had been suspecting that Rebekah had been sharing gossip about her, a few months before she went public with her alleged findings.</p>

      <p>At that time, 33-year-old Coleen is said to have blocked Rebekah on social media after she became suspicious of her activity on her account.</p>
      <p>She then made her Instagram stories private to everyone except Rebekah to see if they would leak.</p>
      <p>Fake stories about Coleen wanting to choose the gender of her next child, her house flooding and going on Strictly all appeared in The Sun.</p>
