      <h1>Gary Oldman Set To Star in a Apple TV+ Series Titled SLOW HORSES</h1>

      <p><b>Gary Oldman</b> has signed on to star in a series adaption of Mick Herron’s Slough House books that is being produced by Apple TV+. The series is titled <b><i>Slow Horses</i></b>, which is the name of the first novel in the book series.</p>
      <p>The series follows “a team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 – Slough House.” Oldman will take on the role of Jackson Lamb, “the brilliant but irascible leader of the spies who end up in Slough House due to their career ending mistakes.”</p>
      <p>I’m not familiar with these books, but it sounds like the kind of story I would enjoy and it also seems like a great project for Oldman to take on.</p>
      <p>The series will be written and executive produced by <i>Veep</i> writer<b> Will Smith</b> (No the actor) along with <b>Graham Yost, Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Iain Canning, Emile Sherman, Gail Matrux,</b> and <b>Douglas Urbanski </b>who are also executive producing.</p>
      <p>Herron has published six novels and two novellas in the Slough House series and there’s another novella due out in January.</p>
      <p>Oldman is currently filming the <b>David Fincher</b>-directed feature <i>Mank</i>, in which Oldman will star as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz during the development of <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
