      <p>Palin gave birth to Sailor in December 2015 and welcomed her other baby girl in May 2017. She is also mother to a 10-year-old son, <b>Tripp Johnston.</b></p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the 29-year-old announced that she was leaving <i>Teen Mom OG</i>. </p>
      <p>On Instagram she wrote: "Teen mom OG wasn't a fit for me, it took away my peace.. and honestly - my peace has a price tag that no one but God can afford. $ doesn't impress me, I don't entertain bs, and walking away from this show allows God to rebuild me (and my little fam) in the right direction."</p>
