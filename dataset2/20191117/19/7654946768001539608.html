      <p>Syracuse University has suspended fraternity life following a string of racist and anti-Semitic episodes, according to a report Sunday.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Kent Syverud said Sunday that Syracuse University — which was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/06/syracuse-university-is-americas-top-party-school-survey-finds/">named the nation’s top party school</a> this year by the Princeton Review — halted social activities at fraternities for the rest of the semester after members of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity were linked to a racial slur hurled on campus, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/17/syracuse-fraternity-school-suspends-activities-after-racist-incidents/4222028002/">USA Today reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“While only one fraternity may have been involved in this particular incident, given recent history, all fraternities must come together with the University community to reflect upon how to prevent recurrence of such seriously troubling behavior,” Syverud wrote in the email to students.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear whether the ban extended to sororities.</p>
      <p><a href="https://dps.syr.edu/2019/11/16/public-safety-informational-notice-bias-incident-reported-near-college-place/">Syracuse’s Department of Public Safety said</a> a black female student reported “being verbally harassed” Saturday night by a group yelling the racial epitaph as she walked by.</p>
      <p>Syverud said the school gathered “substantial evidence” — including surveillance video — and identified the suspects as Alpha Chi Rho members and their guests.</p>
      <p>“This report of an affront to our student’s—and our whole community’s—safety and well-being is the latest incident of several against Jews, Asians and African Americans,” Syverud wrote in his email.</p>
      <p>The fraternity was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, which came the same day the school announced they were looking into two other bias incidents on campus.</p>
      <p>Syracuse said the were two acts vandalism reported at Haven Hall. One involved ant-Semitic graffiti of a swastika, while the other “contained racist language that is derogatory to Asian individuals.”</p>
      <p>No suspects have been identified in connection to the vandalism, officials said.</p>
      <p>Alpha Chi Rho’s national office said it is cooperating with the university to investigate Saturday night’s episode and will hold members accountable.</p>
      <p>“We are disgusted by the language and harassing behavior alleged of a handful of our members and guests of our chapter at Syracuse University,” the fraternity said in a statement. “Such loathsome behavior is contrary to Alpha Chi Rho Fraternity principles that aim to cultivate men of word and deed based on character, honor and integrity.”</p>
      <p>Some criticized the move on Sunday, arguing that black fraternities should not be punished for a white frat’s bad behavior.</p>
      <p>“Even though it was members from a white fraternity that harassed and called a black woman a n—-r, all fraternities at Syracuse have had their social activities suspended,” <a href="https://twitter.com/zellieimani/status/1196150308633743362">tweeted activist Zellie Imani</a>. “Even the Black ones. Ridiculous move.”</p>
      <p>The alleged incident wasn’t the first time the school’s Greek life has been tied to racist behavior. Last year, 18 members of the Theta Tau fraternity <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/09/syracuse-frat-bros-suspended-for-video-filled-with-racist-slurs/">were suspended</a> after they were captured on video using racial slurs and simulating sexual assault.</p>
