      <h2>University issues a circular; V-C appeals to students to resume academic work</h2>

      <p>Vice-Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University M. Jagadesh Kumar on Sunday appealed to students to return to classes and resume their academic and research work so that “losses incurred may be compensated” and they will be able to complete their academic programmes without any further obstacles.</p>
      <p>In a circular signed by the Registrar, students were told that if these academic requirements are not met on time, thousands of students may be affected, damaging their future prospects. Students have not been attending classes since October 28 and their end semester examinations will start on December 12.</p>
      <h3>Reminder to students</h3>
      <p>Those with deadlines for submission of M.Phil. dissertation/Ph.D. thesis in the schools/centres were reminded that there would be no relaxation in deadlines and students may not be able to re-register themselves.</p>
      <p>“Students pursuing their BA (Hons.) programme need to clear all the sessional examinations and maintain a minimum CGPA as specified in ordinance relating to the award of BA (Hons), BA (Pass) degrees failing which their names will be removed from the JNU roll list. The same applies for MA, MSc, degrees as well,” the JNU administration said.</p>
      <p>For award of the Master of Philosophy degree, students need to clear at least 50% of the total courses. In case they fail to clear any of these courses and if they fail to secure a CGPA of 5.00 on completion of course work at the end of second semester, their names will be automatically removed from the roll list of the university, the administration added.</p>
      <p>The administration said that only a few are protesting and destroying the lives of thousands of students. The students have blocked the administration block of the university and have demanded a complete rollback of the hostel fee hike.</p>
