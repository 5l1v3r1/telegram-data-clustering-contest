      <p>The government has taken a ‘hasty’ decision of introducing English medium in government, speakers at a roundtable held by Bala Vikas Foundation on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The decision was taken without consulting or seeking opinions from experts,” said V. Bala Mohan Das, former V-C of ANU and demanded that the G.O. 81 be revoked immediately. The speakers also pointed out that introducing English medium needed qualified teachers and the teachers working at the government schools were not qualified for this.</p>
      <p>Retired vice-principal of Mrs. AVN College Narava Prakasa Rao, several school headmasters and social activists spoke.</p>
