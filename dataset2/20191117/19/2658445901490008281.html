      <p>The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has planned to consolidate the gains recorded from the partial closure of the nation’s borders with the introduction of the e-Customs -the deployment of altruistic technology.</p>
      <p>The federal government in August raised a security exercise codenamed the Ex-SWIFT RESPONSE, which is coordinated by the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), comprising the Nigerian Police Force, Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), the Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies to address trans-border security issues.</p>
      <p>According to the Public Relations Officer, Deputy Comptroller of Customs, Mr. Joseph Attah, the service had already seized smuggled items worth N2.9billion from the exercise.</p>
      <p>But since the borders will not remain closed forever, the service has planned that it will consolidate the gains already recorded from the exercise with the deployment of highly sophisticated technology.</p>
      <p>Speaking with The Nation in Abuja yesterday, he said “looking beyond this border closure, the old way, a time will come when agreements will be reached, and the borders will be opened; are we going to go back to square one? No! We are looking at massive deployment of non-intrusive equipment-technology. In this regard, we are looking at e-Customs as a possible solution.”</p>
      <p>He described the e-Customs project as a modernised electronic system, which will enable the Nigerian Customs Service perform its statutory duty and security functions efficiently.</p>
