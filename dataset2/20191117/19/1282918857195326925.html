      <p>Singer Lucky Ali who became popular with his 1996 hit song 'O Sanam' and later 'Na Tum Jaano Na Hum', in an interview with a news agency said that he is trying to stay irrelevant because it is not about him as an individual, it is in fact about 'we', the music like a holographic diagram. He further went on to say that the number of views he gets online doesn't 'thrill him'. "I am happy when people like it but if you feel happy that ''oh my god! I got so many clicks'', then you are a loser because that's what you depend on," Ali said in an interview.</p>

      <p>The singer hasn't put a stop to learning and says that there is always someone 'in someplace that has got a better understanding than you do'. Lucky Ali collaborated with an Israeli artiste Eliezer Botzer for 'Lemalla' and considers it an 'honorable' experience. Talking about his future projects, Ali has nothing planned as of yet.</p>

      <p>"I have got music that I want to release...that I am trying to function in a way that it gets across to everybody with the least amount of work. I don''t want to work too much on that...you know sell my music. I definitely don't want to ''sell my music''," he told IANS. Ali concluded by saying that he doesn't want to join hands with any big music label because 'they will give him the same story they gave 15 years back' — 'We want to change the face of music'. According to Lucky Ali, music will always be 'seven notes and one cannot change the face of music'.</p>
