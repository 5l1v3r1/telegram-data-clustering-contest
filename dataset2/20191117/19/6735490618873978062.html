      <h1>Elizabeth Warren Has ‘A Plan’ For Taylor Swift’s Battle With Big Machine Label Group</h1>

      <p>Taylor Swift has faced obstacle after obstacle with Big Machine Label Group after Scott Borchetta sold it to Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>The latest battle has had to do with the label blocking Swift from using her old songs in a Netflix documentary about herself and for a performance when she is named Artist of the Decade at the American Music Awards on Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>With the awards a week away, there is no chance that Elizabeth Warren could take the Oval Office by then and fix everything but she does have “a plan” to stop future incidents like this from happening.</p>

      <p>“Unfortunately, @TaylorSwift13 is one of many whose work has been threatened by a private equity firm,” the presidential candidate wrote on Twitter. “They’re gobbling up more and more of our economy, costing jobs and crushing entire industries. It’s time to rein in private equity firms—and I’ve got a plan for that.”</p>

      <p>Borchetta and Braun have disputed Swift’s claims and said that she owes them  “millions of dollars.”</p>
      <p>“At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special,” a <a href="https://ew.com/music/2019/11/15/big-machine-records-taylor-swift-response/">statement</a> read. “In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere. Since Taylor’s decision to leave Big Machine last fall, we have continued to [honour] all of her requests to license her [catalogue] to third parties as she promotes her current record in which we do not financially participate.”</p>

      <p>Swift’s team quickly issued a response which can be read below:</p>
      <p>
        <i>The truth is, on October 28, 2019 at 5:17 p.m. the Vice President, Rights Management and Business Affairs from Big Machine Label Group sent Taylor Swift’s team the following:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Please be advised that BMLG will not agree to issue licenses for existing recordings or waivers of its re-recording restrictions in connection with these two projects:</i>
        <br/>
        <i>The Netflix documentary and</i>
        <br/>
        <i>The Alibaba “Double Eleven” event.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>To avoid an argument over rights, Taylor performed three songs off her new album Lover at the Double Eleven event as it was clear that Big Machine Label Group felt any televised performance of catalog songs violated her agreement. In addition, yesterday Scott Borchetta, CEO and founder of Big Machine Label Group, flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix. Please notice in Big Machine’s statement, they never actually deny either claim Taylor said last night in her post.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Lastly, Big Machine is trying to deflect and make this about money by saying she owes them but, an independent, professional auditor has determined that Big Machine owes Taylor $7.9 million dollars of unpaid royalties over several years.</i>
