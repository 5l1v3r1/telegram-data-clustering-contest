      <p>The Azad Maidan police are on the lookout for unidentified persons who allegedly broke into the parked vehicles of people who were participating in a marathon near the Naval Dockyard on Sunday and stole valuables.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the incident took place at Ballard Estate on Sunday morning, where 15,000 people had gathered for the fourth edition of the Indian Oil Western Naval Command Navy half-marathon.</p>
      <p>“Everyone came in their cars and parked them around the starting point. We were busy manning the route. Meanwhile, thieves targeted their cars, in which the participants had kept their valuables. Unidentified persons broke the windows of the vehicles, took all the valuables and fled,” said an officer.</p>
      <p>The police said several people came to the police station after they saw their cars’ windows smashed. A case under relevant sections of theft was registered.</p>
      <p>“There are around eight complainants so far who have either lost their mobile phones, wallets or documents,” said an officer.</p>
      <p>“We believe that there are more than one person involved in the crime. We have started scrutinising CCTV footage,” said another officer.</p>
      <p>Similar incidents have been reported earlier in Mumbai, Pune and Navi Mumbai, wherein the belongings of people participating in marathons were stolen. The Indian Oil Western Naval Command Navy half-marathon had three race categories — the 21.1 km aircraft carrier run, a 10 km destroyer run, and a 5 km frigate run.</p>
