      <p>Released November 16, 1999, the classic Aftermath album features the singles ‘Still D.R.E.’, ‘The Next Episode’ and ‘Forgot About Dre’ and has gone on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide.</p>
      <p>To mark the 20th anniversary of the album that featured <a href="http://nme.com/artists/snoop-dogg">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/eminem">Eminem</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/xzibit">Xzibit</a>, Devin the Dude, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/nate-dogg">Nate Dogg</a> and more, the super producer sat down with longtime friend and business partner Jimmy Iovine to talk about the making of ‘2001’.</p>
      <p>The pair discuss the events leading up to the album, how they chose the singles, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/jay-z">Jay-Z</a> writing ‘Still D.R.E.’, and even how the <a href="http://nme.com/artists/nwa">N.W.A.</a> co-founder didn’t actually want to feature on the album as a rapper.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t wanna appear on the albums at all, to be honest,” Dre says, referring to both ‘2001’ and his debut album, 1992’s ‘The Chronic’. “I just wanted to produce, find artists and produce them. And Doc, The D.O.C. talked me into getting on the mic and doing this thing.”</p>
