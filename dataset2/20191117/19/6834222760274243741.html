      <h1>MotoGP, Miller: "Me instead of Petrucci? I don't want to steal anyone's place."</h1>

      <p>Along with a Honda and a Yamaha, there's also a Ducati on the Valencia podium. We're talking about Jack Miller's, who took third place, ahead of Andrea Dovizioso's GP19. Not bad for the Australian's performance, who wanted to close a 2019 at its best, where he showed he had a decisive step forward as compared to the previous season.</p>
      <p><i>"I think it was a good weekend. I had fun,</i> " Jack began<i>. "It was much colder this time in Valencia than in the past two seasons, so it wasn't easy. I'm excited about the work done, especially on the race pace. I can't wait to celebrate the result and the season along with the whole team because I had a great time."</i></p>
      <p>Reaching third place was not a simple, predictable thing.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"<b>I think this was one of the best races of my entire career, especially those last eight laps. The wind was blowing really strongly</b>, and it wouldn't have taken much to end up off the track. I tried to avoid taking risks in the early laps. Then I was quite aligned with Quartararo's pace. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do more."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Now it's time for Miller to take stock.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think it was a good year for all of us. We'll now see what will happen, starting from the tests. I'm certainly happy to stay here in Pramac and carry on with the work. I'm also excited to be the fastest Ducati here in Valencia. I could have also been on other occasions, but sometimes the choice of the tire didn't help me, since I wasn't able to make the most of the potential."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there are rumors tied to a probable exchange with Petrucci.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"<b>These are rumors and so they'll remain. I'm not here to steal anyone's place, let alone disturb the other riders</b>. Next year, he'll still be a Pramac rider and, in all this, I'm happy, since I'm on a strong, competitive team. We showed our potential again in Valencia, and you all saw it. I believe I've done my homework well."</i>
