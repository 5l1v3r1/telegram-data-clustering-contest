      <p>Newly single Josh Ritchie, 25, has wasted no time in getting out and about after his split from 29-year-old Charlotte Crosby.</p>
      <p>Instead of nursing his broken heart on the sofa with a tub of ice cream, the Love Island star hit Liv nightclub in Manchester as he made his return to the dating scene over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Josh openly promoted his night on the tiles on social media by uploading stories onto his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account that showed him dancing in the night time venue post break-up.</p>
      <p>The handsome lad happily sang into his camera phone in the footage and showed off the bottles of booze available to him on his VIP table in the club.</p>

      <p>He also appeared on the venue's Instagram stories where he proudly lifted his T-shirt to flaunt his abs as music blared and he let loose.</p>
      <p>Geordie Shore star Charlotte announced the news of her and Josh calling time on their romance via her Instagram stories on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>She admitted that the two year relationship she'd shared with the hunk had "broken down" and she hoped they could "remain civil" after calling it a day.</p>
