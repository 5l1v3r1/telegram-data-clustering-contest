      <p>The Three Lions finished their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a trip to Pristina, having already qualified for next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Both Alexander-Arnold and Oxlade-Chamberlain were again named in Gareth Southgate’s starting lineup, as was the case in Thursday’s 7-0 trouncing of Montenegro at Wembley.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a> were not part of proceedings, having returned to Liverpool with respective knee and illness issues.</p>
      <p>Liverpool fans watched on with concern early on, as Oxlade-Chamberlain twice went down clutching his ankle.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old was able to carry on, though, and it wasn’t long before he stamped his authority on the match, setting up Harry Winks with a slick pass, allowing the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/tottenham">Tottenham</a> man to make it 1-0.</p>

      <p>Alexander-Arnold was less noticeable than his Reds team-mate, struggling to enjoy the same level of influence as he has at club level this season.</p>
      <p>In fact, some of his end product left a lot to be desired and he was caught out defensively on a few occasions.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain was replaced by Mason Mount with 18 minutes remaining—he will have been pleased with the impact he made, despite fading as the match went on.</p>

      <p>Mount, Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford all scored deep into the second half to clinch victory for England, with Alexander-Arnold coming off late on.</p>
      <p>He and Oxlade-Chamberlain will now return to Liverpool duty, where their attention swiftly turns to next Saturday’s trip to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on Sunday, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> was brought off at half-time as Senegal sealed a 4-1 win over Eswatini, having picked up a yellow card in stoppage time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a> started and played the full 90 minutes as Guinea won 2-0 at home to Namibia, producing an excellent performance to follow up from his goal in the 2-2 draw with Mali on Thursday.</p>
