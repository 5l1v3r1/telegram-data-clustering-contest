        <li>In a Q&amp;A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/16/george-takei-dream-dinner-party-star-trek-colleagues-except-one">with The Guardian</a>, actor George Takei was asked who he’d invite to his dream dinner party, and he said he’d pick his colleagues from “Star Trek,” “with one exception.”</li>
        <li>The tongue-in-cheek remark was probably about Takei’s infamous decades-long feud with William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk to Takei’s Sulu.</li>
        <li>In his 1994 autobiography “To the Stars,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/">Takei claimed</a> Shatner would act like he didn’t know who he was on set. He also said Shatner changed a script to prevent Sulu for receiving command of a starship.</li>
        <li>Shatner has <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/">fought back</a> against those accusations before, especially after Takei didn’t invite him to his wedding in 2008. Takei reiterated his dislike of Shatner on “Real Time with Bill Maher” in 2014.</li>

      <p>If George Takei had a dream dinner party, he’d invite his colleagues from “Star Trek,” minus one.</p>
      <p>In a Q&amp;A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/16/george-takei-dream-dinner-party-star-trek-colleagues-except-one">with The Guardian</a>, the actor, best known for his social media presence and for originating the character of Sulu on “Star Trek: The Original Series,” said there would be “one exception” to getting the cast back together.</p>
      <p>Takei didn’t specify who wouldn’t make the cut, but it was probably a tongue-in-cheek reference to the long-running feud he’s had with William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk.</p>
      <p>According to Takei’s 1994 autobiography “To the Stars,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/">he claimed</a> that Shatner would act like he didn’t know who Takei was on set. He even accused Shatner of changing a script so that Takei’s character Sulu wouldn’t receive command of a starship in an episode of “Star Trek.”</p>

      <p>Shatner has <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/">been accused</a> of being difficult to work with before, including by other “Star Trek” cast members like Walter Koenig (Chekov) and James Doohan (Scott). He refuted Takei’s accounts in an online interview after Takei didn’t invite Shatner to his wedding in 2008.</p>
      <p>The feud got particularly nasty then, and Shatner <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/">went so far</a> as to call Takei’s comments “a sickness” and “a psychosis.” Shatner claims to have never read “To the Stars” but did say he didn’t know Takei very well, and made a disparaging comment about how his role was small and he’d only come in to shoot for a day or two.</p>
      <p>On “Real Time with Bill Maher” in 2014, Takei <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/">brought up</a> the feud again, when he was asked why he doesn’t like Shatner.</p>
      <p>“Canadians have a certain image of being even-tempered and friendly and all that,” Takei said on “Bill Maher.” “Well, he is a person who is that way with himself. He is very self-centered.”</p>
