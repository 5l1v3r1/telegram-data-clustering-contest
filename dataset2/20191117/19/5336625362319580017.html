      <p>Branded social media hard world to navigate nowadays, so we don't blame Harry Styles' character for not nailing it in this<i> Saturday Night Live</i> sketch. Or rather, maybe nailing it a bit too much.</p>
      <p>Dylan, Sara Lee Bread's content creator, gets called out on some curious crossover between his personal brand and the company's brand on Instagram. To be fair, though, who wouldn't comment "wreck me daddy" on a Nick Jonas picture?</p>
      <p>The skit is already <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Harry-Styles-instagram-Saturday-Night-Live-14841422.php">boosting Sara Lee Bread's engagement</a>, too. Some Instagram users have taken to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B42TI7uAPLt/">their account to comment</a> "must get rid of toxic in community" and "need me a real king."</p>
