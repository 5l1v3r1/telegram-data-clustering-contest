      </p>
      <p>Barcelona academy product Dani Olmo did not rule out a return to Camp Nou after his impressive form for Dinamo Zagreb led to speculation that the Spanish champions could seek to re-sign him.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old attacking midfielder has scored two goals in six league appearances for Dinamo this season, but it was his performances in Spain’s European Under-21 Championship triumph that helped propel him into contention for a transfer to LaLiga.</p>
      <p>Olmo netted three times to help Spain’s young players to glory and his form in big games has continue in the Champions League, with four goals in nine appearances for a Dinamo side still in contention to reach the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Asked whether his displays might carry him back to Spain, Olmo told Sport: “I hope I can come back, but we’ve just started the season really well.</p>

      <p>“We’re doing well in the Champions League. There are two games left and we depend on ourselves to get through. There’s a lot of work to be done.</p>
      <p>“The Champions League is a shop window for all young players, especially if you’re in a smaller league like Croatia.”</p>
      <p>Olmo did not make a senior appearance for Barcelona before joining Dinamo as a 17-year-old, but he paid tribute to the training academy at La Masia for giving him strong foundations.</p>
      <p>On the speculation over a possible transfer back to Catalonia, Olmo said: “We will see what happens.</p>
      <p>“I don’t close the door on any club, but I’m a Dinamo player, what happens with Dinamo, we will see.</p>
      <p>“Barcelona’s style: touch, movement – that’s added to what I have learned in Croatia.</p>
      <p>“They’ve made me the player I am now.”</p>
