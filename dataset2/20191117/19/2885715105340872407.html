      <h1>Mumbai: BEST depots being underused despite reduced parking rates</h1>
      <h2>From August 1, when the reduced rates were implemented, until November 13, just 10,565 vehicles of all types have utilised the depots for parking.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:23:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Iram Siddique</a></address>
      <p>In the three months since the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) reduced parking rates at its depots, just 5,056 private buses and 237 school buses have used them.</p>
      <p>From August 1, when the reduced rates were implemented, until November 13, just 10,565 vehicles of all types have utilised the depots for parking. The figures point to an occupancy gap with the 24 BEST depots and 36 termini having space to accommodate 3,500 buses during daytime and 325 at night every day. The city has at least 14,000 private buses, including tourist, intercity, school and employee buses. Apart from 5,056 private buses, as many as 3,746 four-wheelers, 861 two-wheelers and 325 trucks-tempos have used these depots. Only 237 school buses and 237 three-wheelers used the depots over the same period.</p>
      <p>Additional General Secretary of Mumbai Bus Malak Sanghatna, Malik Patel, said more parking spaces are needed at night. “Some depots like Marol, which have lesser capacity, see an occupancy rate of 100 per cent, while others, despite having more space like Mumbai Central, are not as popular. It varies with location of the depot as a driver will not travel to another part of the city to park his bus.”</p>
      <p>“All 325 parking lots which allow day and night parking have 100 per cent occupancy. There is a need to create more space for night parking as the reduced parking rates are very good and are being received very well,” he added.</p>
      <p>Gautam Chatterjee, chairman of Mumbai Parking Authority, said, “The underutilisation of parking space is a challenge for us which will have to be met with. There might be some areas with fewer buses but more space, while some will have more buses but not adequate space. A balance needs to be struck and other vehicles need to be encouraged to utilise these depots. We will work to enforce traffic rules to ensure motorists get off roads and more parking lots are filled.”</p>
