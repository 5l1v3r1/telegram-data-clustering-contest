      <h1>Max Verstappen takes brilliant Brazilian Grand Prix victory after chaotic climax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:20:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Duncan, Luke Slater, live updates</a></address>
      <p>Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc pointed the finger of blame at each other following their late collision on yet another miserable afternoon for Ferrari in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Max Verstappen delivered a dominant performance to win for a second time this year, finishing ahead of Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly, with Lewis Hamilton taking the flag in third.</p>
      <p>Hamilton, however, was handed a five-second penalty, dropping him to seventh and promoting McLaren’s Carlos Sainz to third, following a penultimate-lap coming together with Alex Albon.</p>
      <p>Hamilton’s collision with Albon encapsulated the frenetic nature of a race effectively deemed a dead-rubber after the he had sewn up his sixth world championship in Texas a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Yet, despite Verstappen’s masterclass – the Dutchman proving again why some regard him as the best driver on the grid – and Hamilton’s banzai move on Albon, which cruelly denied him his first career podium, the penultimate round of the 2019 campaign might yet be remembered as the straw that broke the camel’s back at Ferrari.</p>
      <p>The tension has been simmering between their two drivers – the four-times world champion Vettel and emerging talent, Leclerc – since the opening round of the campaign in Melbourne eight months’ ago. Here, at one of the iconic venues on the grand prix calendar, it sensationally boiled over.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Leclerc, having started 14th following a grid penalty, was battling Vettel for fourth with five laps to go. He dived underneath Vettel at the Senna Esses and made the pass stick. It was a perfect move.</p>
      <p>Leclerc held off Vettel as they emerged from the third corner, but on the run down to the ensuing bend, Vettel latched on to Leclerc’s tow before drawing alongside his team-mate, and then subtly moving across him.</p>
      <p>Vettel’s left-rear tyre made contact with Leclerc’s right-front, and in a flurry of sparks and broken carbon fibre, both Ferraris were out of the race. The contact was gentle, but the result devastating. Leclerc vented his anger by wagging his right fist at Vettel, who looked to be at fault, from inside his Ferrari cockpit. Both men were then on the radio in a series of furious outbursts.</p>
      <p>“What the hell is he doing?” said Vettel, protesting his innocence.</p>
      <p>“What the hell,” yelled Leclerc in the sister Ferrari, before he delivered a number of bleeped-out expletives. Later, the young driver, 22, said: “I left the space Seb took, and then towards the end of the straight he started to squeeze me.</p>

      <p>“Everything happened very quickly, and as soon as he went to the side we touched and then I had a puncture. In the future, we will put it behind us and continue to work together.”</p>
      <p>Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto claimed it is a luxury to have two superstar drivers, but for how much longer is their partnership tenable?</p>
      <p>“The drivers need to feel sorry for the team because they were free to fight,” said Binotto. “I am disappointed. They know that silly mistakes are something we should avoid.</p>
      <p>“When you have a crash, there are two drivers and both of them have got at least a small percentage, or a part percentage of responsibility. I don’t want to judge now.”</p>
      <p>Both drivers were then pulled from a scheduled print media briefing on Sunday night, leaving Binotto to face the music alone. “We prefer it like this,” said a Ferrari spokesperson.</p>

      <p>Hamilton, meanwhile, apologised to Albon after the world champion accepted full responsibility for their crash. Hamilton, running behind Albon after he stopped for a third time under a late safety car, attempted to pass the London-born Red Bull driver for second place with just two laps to run.</p>
      <p>But the Mercedes driver smashed into the side of the rookie, spinning the Red Bull man around. Hamilton limped to the flag with damage to the front of his car.</p>
      <p>Hamilton’s late lunge denied Albon, 23, a first career podium. He finished outside the points in 14th.</p>
      <p>“I apologise to Alex, and I hold my hands up for the accident,” said Hamilton, who was also hit with two penalty points on his drivers’ licence. “I totally accept the blame. It was not my intention and you hardly ever see me collide with anyone. In hindsight I could have waited to make the move, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>
      <p>“An opportunity arose and I was in shooting distance. I gave it a shot because in my mind I was trying to catch Max [Verstappen] for the win.</p>
      <p>“That won’t be the last time Alex is in position for a podium. He will have many more great races so, as hard a pill as it is for him to swallow, I hope he can learn from the experience.”</p>
      <p>A statement from the stewards read: “Albon was on his normal race line. Hamilton attempted to pass on the inside, but he was unable to get far enough inside to accomplish the overtake.</p>
      <p>“By the time he realised there would not be sufficient room he was unable to back out of the situation and the collision followed. The stewards determined that Hamilton was predominantly at fault.”</p>
      <p>Albon, who was recently rewarded with his fine start to life at Red Bull with a new deal for 2020, said: “I’m not angry at Lewis. I feel like it’s one of those things.</p>
      <p>“Of course I wanted the podium and I felt like we deserved it, but that’s it really. It’s racing.”</p>

      <h3>Right that's it from me today</h3>
      <p>Nothing from the stewards about anything yet but we shall see. A lot to unpack from that race and I will be trying to do that in my post-race analysis which will be up on telegraph.co.uk/sport tomorrow. Thanks for joining me. A dead rubber but again, a brilliant race in Brazil. </p>
      <p>Here is the incident between the Ferraris. I've written a lot about them this season. Tooooo many mistakes. By far. </p>

      <h3>Alex Albon talks post-race after crashing with Lewis Hamilton and missing out on a podium</h3>
      <blockquote>I need to look at it back, to be honest. We came out of turn nine. I had some gap to Lewis, I thought we were okay where we are. I thought I'd go in a little hot and turn to cover him, to make sure he doesn't get any ideas. Once you dive there's a blind spot. I didn't expect him. It's kind of that thing where you are just waiting for it. It's a shame because I think he would have overtaken me anyway. He was looking racy. </blockquote>

      <h3>Leclerc and Vettel react to colliding </h3>
      <p>
        <b> Leclerc:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>From my side I overtook in turn one. In turn three I had to close because I was aware Seb would try again and he did, which there was little space but I left the space. He started to squeeze me and we were very close. As soon as he went to the inside we touched. I haven't seen Seb yet but I think we are mature enough to put that behind us. </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Vettel: </b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I didn't have much space on the right and had a better run out of turn three and tried to pass. It's a shame for the team we didn't finish the race, that has priority.  </blockquote>

      <h3>Christian Horner reacts to a Red Bull win</h3>
      <blockquote>Pretty tense. Gutted for Alex at the end, it should have been a 1-2 finish. Redemption for Max, 12 months down the line. He's driven a brilliant race. Passed Lewis twice. </blockquote>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Well, Verstappen was supreme</h3>
      <p>But he still had to overtake Hamilton twice to win the race. He had to work for it. I think Hamilton will take a penalty for that incident with Albon, as much as Albon left the door open for him. If that's the case then it'll be a shame that Sainz won't be able to stand on the podium. But that is very much to be confirmed. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Hamilton apologises to Albon for their crash</h3>
      <blockquote>I massively apologise to Albon, the gap was there and obviously it closed at the end. It was completely my fault. They outclassed us today. I left nothing on the table and I took a lot of risks today. We threw everything and the sink at it. We could keep up with him in the corners but they were outshining us on the straights. </blockquote>
      <p>It's a real shame, to be honest. Hamilton will be up on the podium but he may well lose that. I don't think they will get it done quickly enough for the podium ceremony. Vettel and Leclerc being looked at and a few other cars being looked at for using DRS under double waved yellows.  </p>

      <h3>Pierre Gasly reacts to his first career podium and P2</h3>
      <blockquote>It's such a special moment. I don't know what to say. To get it with these guys with Toro Rosso, they gave me a fantastic car since I came back. I have been many times on the podium [in previous series] and you kind of forget it. That's what I love about motorsport. I tried to push as much as I could. Great finish with Lewis as well. Big congrats to these guys as well. </blockquote>

      </p>
      <h3>Max Verstappen reacts to a brilliant win</h3>
      <blockquote>I mean, Lewis was very quick. I had to keep pushing. We had to really be on top of our pit stops. Two times we had a good move with him. From there onwards I could control the race with the tyres I had. It was a lot of fun out there. I was pushing flat out in my out lap to be close to him and it was my only time. We knew that we had great top speed the whole weekend. Very happy to get past. </blockquote>

      <h3>MAX VERSTAPPEN WINS THE 2019 BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX</h3>
      <p>THAT WASN'T THE BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX. THAT WAS THE BRAZILLIANT GRAND PRIX!</p>
      <p>Gasly second by a metre! What a drive for him. After being ditched by Red Bull he has driven superbly. Vettel is stuck in the middle of the track. Throughout it ALL, Max Verstappen drove brilliantly. </p>
      <p>Perhaps Hamilton will take a five second penalty for that incident which would promote Sainz to the podium! </p>

      <h3>FINAL LAP</h3>
      <p>Disaster for Albon. He gave Hamilton an open invitation to overtake him there and he took it. But not very well. Now Hamilton is trying to beat Gasly to the line...</p>
      <p>Verstappen the leader btw...</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 70 of 71 - Gasly loses third instantly</h3>
      <p>To Hamilton. Hamilton is back in this race now...but second might be the best he can do. He'll have to fight Albon! </p>
      <p>Hamilton tries to go through the inside of the hairpin at the end of the lap and goes too deep! They collide! Albon was on for a podium but he's dropped down to P15 now.  Hamilton takes some front wing damage but is still third. He'll take a penalty for that, surely...</p>

      <h3>Lap 66 of 71 - The two Ferraris collide!</h3>
      <p>They get very close on the back straight! Vettel comes back at Leclerc after he lost the position, moves across on Leclerc, clipping across his front right. Leclerc's front suspension has gone and Vettel's got a huge puncture. What disaster for them!</p>

      <h3>Lap 64 of 71 - Albon and Vettel tussle at the start of the lap</h3>
      <p>Vettel tries one around the outside at turn one, briefly gets the place but Albon fights back and retakes third. Excellent driving, quicker on the power. That gives Hamilton a second or two breathing space in second. Verstappen cruising to victory now but it's so, so tight behind him...</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 63 of 71 - Albon within DRS range of Hamilton</h3>
      <p>Hamilton had some kind words to say about the young Red Bull driver a few weeks ago. It'll be interesting to see how stoutly he defends the Red Bull now...</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 62 of 71 - Verstappen cruising at the front now, brilliant pace</h3>
      <p>Vettel is giving Albon hell right now but Albon is within DRS range of Hamilton. Hamilton's concerns now lie behind him rather than in front of him. Verstappen is 2.7s ahead. Both Red Bulls went around the outside of their rivals at turn one at the restart for position. Brilliant stuff. </p>

      <h3>Lap 60 of 71 - Verstappen takes the lead!</h3>
      <p><b>VERSTAPPEN DOES IT AGAIN!</b>He goes through and takes the lead at turn one!  He's back where he wants to be. Superb move. Clinical. Hamilton tried to fight back but couldn't do it. The Red Bull is mighty around this track. Hamilton backed them up and backed them up so they were within inches of each other but Verstappen was just too good. </p>
      <p>Albon gets past both Vettel at the restart! He's up into P3! Can he close up on Hamilton now?!</p>

      <h3>Lap 59 of 71 - SC in this lap!</h3>
      <p>FINALLY! </p>
      <p>Hamilton REALLY backs the pack up at the end of the lap, bolts and then slows down again, trying to throw Verstappen to the wolves behind him...this'll be interesting!</p>

      <p><b>OUT:</b> BOT</p>
      <p>COME ON GET ON WITH IT. All of the lapped cars are out of the way, there's no reason for them to hold on. David Croft on Sky Sports F1 says they are waiting for the lapped (now non-lapped) cars to get far enough ahead so that they aren't caught within a lap or two of the restart by the leaders. But, <i>reeeeeallly</i>, why? We can't wait around forever.  The longer the SC is out, though, the better for Hamilton. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1824">6:24PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 56 of 71 - Interesting call from Mercedes</h3>
      <p>But they will have track position at least. But it's not like there are only a few laps left. It'll be 11, 12 and maybe 13 laps to go once the SC comes in. The lapped cars are unlapping themselves. Plenty of them but hopefully the safety car will be in soon. I can't see Hamilton holding on here. Leclerc will have a decent run at a podium here on his fresh tyres. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1822">6:22PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 55 of 71 - Leclerc stops from P5, Albon stays out</h3>
      <p>How will this work out? Bottas's car is nearly out of the danger zone so the SC should be in this lap. Verstappen has two lapped cars between himself and Hamilton but this is going to bunch up. Hamilton asks for more power...</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1820">6:20PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 54 of 71 - I thought that would be okay for Bottas to park there</h3>
      <p>But it was in an awkward place, really, as close to the gap in the barriers he was there. Hamilton told to do the opposite of what Verstappen does strategy-wise under the safety car! Verstappen pits and goes onto the soft tyres! This race just got even more interesting...Hamilton stays out, of course. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1819">6:19PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 53 of 71 - "Lewis didn't slow down enough," Verstappen says about Hamilton under the yellow flags</h3>
      <p>Red Bull say they saw it. Not sure anything will come of that. The yellow flags are still out in sector one and two but not for very long. <i>OR WILL THEY?</i></p>
      <p>
        <b>SAFETY CAR OUT!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1817">6:17PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 52 of 71 - Bottas retires, pulling up at the end of the back straight</h3>
      <p>He finds the gap in the barriers. Not a great race from him but that's cost him a few points. Not that it matters, he's guaranteed second in the championship. Hamilton now within DRS range of Verstappen. Both set exactly the same lap time last time around. </p>

      <h3>Lap 51 of 71 - Bottas's engine is about to go, I think</h3>
      <p>Blue smoke coming out of the back of it. I don't think it's long for this world...</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 50 of 71 - Vettel has stopped</h3>
      <p>And comes out in P4. He's within a second of Albon but I doubt he'll be there for long. Indeed he won't be, Albon stops. Albon not really in Verstappen's league pyramid structure this weekend. <b>Hamilton has closed to within a second of the lead now...</b></p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 49 of 51 - McLarens both into the points, P9 and P10</h3>
      <p>But Sainz is about to come under attack from Raikkonen in P11 on the fresher soft tyres. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1813">6:13PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 48 of 71 - Verstappen sets his fastest lap</h3>
      <p>And takes four tenths out of Hamilton, who wants more power. I think this is going to be very tough for Hamilton to win this one here. It'll require a mistake from Verstappen. Leclerc still driving the widest Ferrari in the world, keeping Bottas behind at turn one, jinking around at turn one. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 46 of 71 - Vettel leads</h3>
      <p>But he will likely have to stop again. Even so, he's only 5.1s ahead of Verstappen and on much older tyres. Even if he stays out he won't win this race. He's lapping over 1.5s off the pace of Verstappen.</p>
      <p>Hamilton has taken two tenths out of Verstappen that last lap. Will the Dutchman respond? Meanwhile Bottas is stuck behind Leclerc in P6. He can't quite get enough pace on the back straight to get close enough for a lunge.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 45 of 71 - Verstappen retains the lead</h3>
      <p>Hamilton, though, has closed the gap to 1.5s with that earlier stop but it hasn't worked out as well as the first stop did. Slowly, slowly, catchee Maxy. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 44 of 71 - It's hammer time</h3>
      <p>Hamilton is told this out lap is critical. He knows, he says. Of course he does. Why do they tell him? Verstappen comes in at the end of the lap and will surely retain the lead? It's a 1.9s stop from the Red Bull mechanics. It's going to be close...</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 43 of 71 - "What are you waiting for? I can't get any closer than this!" - Hamilton</h3>
      <p>He wants to be brought in. He's closed to 2.7s to Verstappen. Does he need a bit more time for the undercut? He won't want to get the lead and then be vulnerable at the end of the race. He comes in at the end of the lap...it's onto the mediums. 27 laps to go...</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1805">6:05PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 42 of 71 - Bottas pits again</h3>
      <p>He goes onto the mediums. His definite one-stop strategy has turned into a definite two-stop. Those hard tyres were not working out for him. </p>

      <h3>Lap 39 of 71 - I can't see Vettel going to the end on these tyres</h3>
      <p>But he might be able to go onto the soft tyres very late on and run at the front two who may be on more worn medium tyres. Who will stop first out of Verstappen and Hamilton, though?</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Lap 35 of 71 - Verstappen leads Hamilton by 3.1s</h3>
      <p>Hamilton sets his fastest lap of the day to take near enough 0.3s out of Verstappen that time. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1757">5:57PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 34 of 71 - This is a very interesting strategic race</h3>
      <p>Hamilton is really throwing it into the corners but he's losing two tenths a lap to Verstappen now. Verstappen has a pit stop in hand ahead of Bottas now. Vettel is told he's faster than the leaders. He's not at the moment but his pace overall is fairly decent. I don't think Vettel will get to the end on these tyres. Hards may have been the better choice, as they did with Leclerc. Bit of a nothing strategy, I think. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1755">5:55PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 33 of 71 - Hamilton falling back now</h3>
      <p>"It's got windier, right?" he barks on the radio. I think it's his tyres that are the problem rather than the wind. His lap times aren't awful but he's consistently a tenth or two behind Verstappen. Vettel is also a little quicker but it's all much of a muchness at the moment but Hamilton's tyres will give up sooner and Vettel will have track position. Vettel is in this race, for now. </p>

      <h3>Lap 31 of 71 - 5s time penalty for Kubica for an unsafe release</h3>
      <p>Right into Verstappen's path. Hamilton has set his personal best but he's lost a couple of tenths on Verstappen. Vettel still going okay, though but is nine seconds away from Hamilton. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 30 of 71 - Both McLarens pit</h3>
      <p>Sainz comes out in P15 and Norris in P13. The race may come to them at the end but it's not been a brilliant day for them. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 29 of 71 - Charles Leclerc into the pits</h3>
      <p>And he goes onto the hard tyres. A definite one stop. Vettel may have to stop again from third. Vettel is currently 13 seconds off the lead. Hamilton in second 2.265 away from Verstappen ahead but without the pace to challenge. The front two definitely have to stop again, though. Vettel has good pace at the moment. Quicker than the front two, in fact, despite being on the harder medium tyres. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 28 of 71 - The Verstappen/Kubica incident in the pit lane is being investigated</h3>
      <p>But that was not Verstappen's fault in any way. Hamilton saying he can't keep up with Verstappen. He's two seconds behind now. Hamilton came out ahead of Verstappen after their pit stops but by the end of Verstappen's out lap he was right up by the Mercedes and then soon ahead of him at the start of the next lap. Hamilton is not happy about how it's turned out. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 26 of 71 - Hamilton thinks he has an engine problem?</h3>
      <p>The team says everything is okay but a bit hot. Bottas pits from the lead meaning Verstappen and Hamilton are back out in front on their own. Bottas goes onto the hards so that's a definite one-stop strategy. Leclerc in third, still out on the mediums. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1744">5:44PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 25 of 71 - Ferrari out for Vettel</h3>
      <p>He pits from the lead. Will this be a one-stop strategy from them? Vettel goes onto the mediums, so probably. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1743">5:43PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 24 of 71 - Hamilton not very happy about something</h3>
      <p>I think about his battery being dead. Effing and jeffing on the radio. Was that why Verstappen came from nowhere at the end of that lap? Meanwhile Hamilton goes around the outside of Albon at turn one, a nice clean move. He's right up to the back of Verstappen again. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1742">5:42PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 23 of 71 - Verstappen takes Hamilton for the net lead!</h3>
      <p>Verstappen comes from nowhere! He gets Hamilton down the inside of turn one! Hamilton tries to get back into turn four but isn't close enough. Woah. That was a really poor move from Williams and Kubica in the pits there, Verstappen was pushed right into the wall. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 22 of 71 - Hamilton being held up by Leclerc at the moment</h3>
      <p>But not for too long as he goes around the outside of the long right-hander towards the end of the lap. Verstappen follows Hamilton in passing Leclerc and he's up to the back of him already onto the pit straight! This'll be close!</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1739">5:39PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 21 of 71 - Will Red Bull react and bring Verstappen in?</h3>
      <p>Yes, they do. Wise. He was approaching traffic and it could have been risky. Quick stop needed...he's also onto the softs. But a new set but Kubica comes out RIGHT in front of him and he has to get on the anchors...Verstappen comes out behind Hamilton! That is terrible news for Red Bull...</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1738">5:38PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 20 of 71 - Hamilton stops</h3>
      <p>And goes onto the soft tyres. That's a certified two-stopper!</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1737">5:37PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 19 of 71 - Hamilton the quicker man at the moment</h3>
      <p>Who will blink first? Is the undercut more powerful than the overcut? Bottas is almost nowhere. Front two have the problem of coming out behind Leclerc on the mediums, though. That's the issue. He'll run for a long time on those but on fresh tyres he may be easy pickings...</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1735">5:35PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 18 of 71 - Sergio Perez pits</h3>
      <p>But he wasn't really a prospect for the points. Hamilton closes Verstappen down by a couple of tenths.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1734">5:34PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 17 of 71 - Bottas and Mercedes thinking plan B</h3>
      <p>Whatever that is. A two-stopper presumably. Expect a stop soon from him then. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1733">5:33PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 16 of 71 - Verstappen responds to Hamilton</h3>
      <p>But again the two are lapping very similarly. 1.13.556 vs 1.13.658 the last time around. Vettel now 6.4s behind Verstappen. Leclerc not making great inroads into Albon for P5. Bottas a bit lonely in P4. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 15 of 71 - Ricciardo given five second time penalty for that incident with Magnussen</h3>
      <p>Not great. That drops him back to...well, it drops him back five seconds further back from the man in P19 as the Aussie is currently last. Frustrating season for him. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1731">5:31PM</a>

      </figure>
      <p> No real surprise. The first and last sectors are mostly flat out. The middle sector is the tight and twisty section. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 13 of 71 - Hamilton starting to close the gap</h3>
      <p>It's down to under two seconds at the end of the lap. Vettel not quite keeping up with their pace. Hamilton on the attack, it seems. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1728">5:28PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 12 of 71 - Verstappen still going nicely</h3>
      <p>10 seconds separates the top four but Bottas isn't really in this race. It's a three horse race. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1727">5:27PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 11 of 71 - Verstappen leads Hamilton by 2.3s</h3>
      <p>Not much in it at all. Vettel clinging on to the front two, five seconds or so away from Verstappen now. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2019/11/17/brazilian-grand-prix-2019-f1-live-updates-sao-paulo-results/#update-20191117-1725">5:25PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Lap 10 of 71 - Leclerc gets Gasly for P6</h3>
      <p>Slicing through the field, into the top six now after just 10 laps. Not even 10 laps! He's four seconds down the road from Albon in P5. Verstappen leads by 2.4s from Hamilton, not much happening out front. Vettel a further 2.4s behind Hamilton. </p>

      <h3>Lap 8 of 71 - Ricciardo punts Magnussen off the track</h3>
      <p>He tries one down the inside of turn four which is a very, very, difficult place to overtake. Ricciardo locked up on the inside and damaged his own front wing, knocking the Haas of the track. Oh dear. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 7 of 71 - Grosjean holding his place in the points in P9</h3>
      <p>But the other Haas of Magnussen has slipped back to P13. Leclerc takes Raikkonen at the start of the lap for P7. He's closing up on Gasly now. </p>

      <h3>Lap 6 of 71 - Verstappen's lead stabilises at 2.5s</h3>
      <p>Albon has slipped back nearly a second on Bottas there. Lost a lot of time the last lap around. Not sure what happened but he's now out of DRS range. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>Lap 5 of 71 - Leclerc up to P8 as he goes down the inside of Grosjean at turn one</h3>
      <p>Albon is putting Bottas under pressure and he's within DRS range. Mercedes, apparently, think Verstappen is going for a two-stop strategy due to his pace. 2.5s at the end of the lap. Not sure about that, to be honest. Vettel 1.4s behind Hamilton, keeping him honest. </p>

      <h3>Lap 2 of 71 - Verstappen leads Hamilton</h3>
      <p>Some brilliant action in the midfield between Ricciardo and Norris at the start of the lap. Ricciardo got Norris at the start of the lap and into turn one but Norris waited around the outside of turn three and went around the outside. Then he nearly forced the Renault onto the grass...Norris keeps his place but he's donw in P12 now...</p>
      <p>Verstappen leads by 1.7s from Hamilton. </p>

      <h3>THE 2019 BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX IS GO!</h3>
      <p>It's a long way at the front...</p>
      <p>Good start by Vettel initially but Hamilton fights back into turn one...he squeezes around the outside of Vettel and into second! Verstappen keeps his lead with a big gap into sector two. That's what we wanted to see! Leclerc is up to P13 and tries to get around Ricciardo...and Norris! The two came so close to coming together there...</p>

      <p>Top 10 all on softs. Ricciardo, Hulkenberg, Leclerc, Kvyat and both Williams on mediums. Everyone else on softs. </p>

      <h3>Bit of a rough day for McLaren yesterday</h3>
      <p>Sainz didn't set a time in Q3 and starts 20th. Points will be hard from there. Norris moves up a place due to Leclerc's penalty and starts P10 but with a fresh set of tyres. So I think a few points from where he is would be a good result. He could do with a bit of luck for once. </p>

      <h3>Predictions?</h3>
      <p>Hard to see past Verstappen, really. But I think Hamilton could be a thorn in his side. Bernie Ecclestone, meanwhile, thinks Vettel is going to win. He's speaking to Sky Sports F1 at the moment and seems a little stumped about being asked about Lewis Hamilton's sixth world titles. "I think...I don't know..." he says. I wonder if he was going to say that his dominance is bad for the sport. Probably...</p>

      <h3>It'll be a shame to lose Nico Hulkenberg from the grid</h3>
      <p>But he seems to have run out of available seats. He said he hopes to return to the grid but, at his age, it's very difficult to come back from that. I think Red Bull should have considered him next year over Albon, although I can see why they didn't. He took his one and only F1 pole position here back in 2010. The grid for 2020 is looking very similar to 2019 with just Kubica moving out of Williams and Hulkenberg moving away from Renault. </p>
      <p>15 minutes to go until lights out. </p>

      <h3>Haas have a had a rotten - and largely very strange - season</h3>
      <p>And yesterday's performance in qualifying is another chapter. They have scored just two points since the summer break but yesterday both Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen made it into Q3... running the Australia-spec versions of their cars. Absolutely staggering. I wouldn't expect too much from them today, though. </p>

      <p> Charles Leclerc starts on the medium tyres, nothing there from Pirelli suggesting going medium-softs is the way to go, though. The Ferrari will be quick enough to slice its way through the field, though. Will anyone else in the bottom 10 and with a free tyre choice bolt the mediums on?</p>

      <h3>Good afternoon F1 fans</h3>
      <p>And welcome to our liveblog for qualifying for the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix. It's the penultimate race of the season and, although it'd have been nice to have either championship still alive, these dead rubbers can often produce exciting races with that end-of-term feeling. The good news is that we have three different cars in the top three on the grid. The bad news is that Max Verstappen, who sits on pole, is going to take some beating today. </p>
      <p>He was just over a tenth of a second ahead of Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari and just under two tenths away from Lewis Hamilton in third. It was a decent effort from both Vettel and Hamilton but neither of them had enough to challenge the supreme Verstappen, who was quickest in Q1, Q2 and Q3. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Here's what he had to say after his second pole position of the season yesterday. </p>
      <blockquote>I’m very happy with pole here today and the car and engine were performing really strongly together. We made a few improvements overnight and even after FP3 we made some final touches to the car and it really came alive in qualifying. Straight away from Q1 the car was flying and even though Q3 was a little more tricky as the temperature increased the car still felt good. Going purple in the middle sector and to be on pole by over a tenth here is a strong performance for us and Honda. Normally we have a quick race car so hopefully that will be the same tomorrow and I really enjoy driving on this track. I’m expecting an exciting and hopefully an enjoyable race, so now we just have to finish it off tomorrow.</blockquote>
      <p>Vettel, meanwhile, is reasonably confident of his chances in the race, but seemed concerned about tyre wear. Ferrari are on much better form here than in Austin two weeks ago, but whether they can continue that through the race remains to be seen. </p>
      <blockquote>We improved the car, it felt better and it was coming alive in quali, I am reasonably optimistic that we are in good shape for the race, but we will have to wait and see. It is supposed to be a bit warmer and it will be important to look after the tyres and to make the right strategy calls.</blockquote>
      <p>As ever, I'll be here for the next few hours to take you through all the build-up, live updates and reaction from the Brazilian GP.  </p>
