      <p>BATTLEOVERDOYEN REMAINS UNBEATEN over fences after winning the Liam &amp; Valerie Brennan Memorial Florida Pearl Novice Chase at Punchestown.</p>
      <p>The Gordon Elliott-trained six-year-old, ridden by Davy Russell on Saturday, took over at the second-last before powering to victory by over five lengths.</p>
      <p>The pace was set by Dandy Mag and then Any Second Now, but Russell bided his time and picked his moment to surge to the finish aboard the 2-to-5 favourite.</p>
      <p>“He’s a nice horse, and I think he wants three miles,” said trainer Elliott following Sunday’s two-mile-six-and-a-half furlong Grade Two feature.</p>
      <p>Battleoverdoyen is unlikely to join famed stablemate Samcro in next month’s Grade One Drinmore Novice Chase at Fairyhouse, however.</p>
      <p>“He’s improved in fitness from Galway,” added Elliott. “He’s in the Drinmore, but I’d say that will come a bit soon, and we’ll probably step him up to three miles in Leopardstown at Christmas.</p>

      <p>“Samcro will go for the Drinmore, and we’ll probably run something else along with him.”</p>
