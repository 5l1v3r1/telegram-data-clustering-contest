      <p>The influx of posts on social media related to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut was spurred on by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/dxmv3x/announcement_when_this_post_is_5_hours_old_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">week-long campaign</a> by the movement's supporters. The movement was initially prompted by <i>Justice League</i>'s troubled production -- which culminated in Snyder having to leave the project due to a family tragedy. <i>The Avengers</i> director Joss Whedon was enlisted in to complete reshoots that reportedly gave the version of the film that was released in theaters a lighter tone. Shortly thereafter, rumors of a shelved "Snyder Cut" of <i>Justice League</i> gained traction online. In addition to Affleck and Gadot, multiple people involved with <i>Justice League</i> have voiced support for #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, including their co-stars Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa.</p>

      <p>Affleck portrayed Bruce Wayne/Batman in the DCEU from 2016 to 2017. He made his debut as the Dark Knight in 2016's <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i>, before also making an uncredited cameo in that year's <i>Suicide Squad</i>. 2017's <i>Justice League</i> would prove to be his final outing as Batman, with the film's underwhelming critical and commercial performance causing a shift in Warner Bros.' approach to its DC films.</p>
      <p>Batman is currently headed for a reboot, with director Matt Reeves' <i>The Batman</i> currently in the midst of development. The film is slated for release in 2021, with <i>The Lighthouse</i> star Robert Pattinson stepping up as the new Bruce Wayne. In the meantime, up next for the DCEU is the Margot Robbie-starred <i>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</i>, which arrives this coming February.</p>
