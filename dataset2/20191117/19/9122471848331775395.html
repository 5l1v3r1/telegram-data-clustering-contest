      <h1>Danny Kanell Says LSU Has A “Liability” vs. Clemson, Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:45:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>LSU climbed to 10-0 on Saturday following a hard-fought road win over SEC rival Ole Miss. With convincing wins over Texas, Florida, Auburn and especially Alabama, it’s clear that the Tigers are the team to beat.</p>
      <p>But college football analyst Danny Kanell pointed to one problem that could ultimately doom them against the likes of Clemson and Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter on Sunday, Kanell asserted that LSU would win the SEC outright. But he’s leery of the Tigers’ defense, and called it “a liability against the big boys.”</p>
      <blockquote>LSU will win the SEC but their defense is a liability against the big boys</blockquote>

      <p>While fans on Twitter were quick to dismiss Kanell’s criticism, there does appear to be some merit to what he’s said.</p>
      <p>LSU has allowed a combined 78 points in their last two games. In fact, they’ve allowed at least 28 points five times this season.</p>
      <p>Granted, LSU was so far ahead in games against Vanderbilt, Alabama and Ole Miss that it’s almost understandable that the defense might have let their foot off the gas.</p>
      <p>But with so much at stake, LSU will need to tighten up everything in order to make it to the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Georgia, Ohio State, and Clemson can make any team that gives them an opening pay dearly for it.</p>
