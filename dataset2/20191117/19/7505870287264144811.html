      <h1>Google reportedly manipulates its search results way more than it wants you to believe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:08:43+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Meek</a></address>
      <p>As an antitrust investigation led by state attorneys general expands from advertising to take a closer look at Google’s search practices, which <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/14/google-antitrust-investigation-chrome-android-search-attorneys-general/">we told you about on Thursday</a>, the results of a newspaper investigation published on Friday may add even more fuel to that fire. Specifically, it’s a report that probes all the ways the search giant manipulates the results that you see — in ways that contradict Google’s insistence that it doesn’t tip the scales — and takes a closer look at blacklists and ways that Google favors big businesses over small ones in search results, among other tweaks the company’s engineers make behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>The investigation was published by <i><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-google-interferes-with-its-search-algorithms-and-changes-your-results-11573823753">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> and based on more than 100 interviews, as well as what the <i>Journal</i> said was its own testing of Google Search. The findings are likely to provide more ammunition for critics such as those on the right who believe the company lets left-leaning political bias influence its search results, as well as small businesses that don’t rank as highly as companies like eBay and Amazon.</p>
      <p>Among the findings, even though Google says in a company blog post that “We do not use human curation to collect or arrange the results on a page,” the <i>Journal</i> implies the company does exactly that. Often in response to pressure from governments worldwide, businesses, or a variety of interest groups.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Journal’s</i> sources, Google has also manipulated its search algorithms to favor big businesses — and that in at least one instance, did so to favor eBay, a major Google advertiser.</p>
      <p>Among other findings of the investigation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Autocomplete search results have sometimes “sanitized” sensitive subjects in a way not seen on competing search engines.</li>
        <li>Google engineers also sometimes make changes to search-related information that gets fed into places like Google knowledge panels where those engineers aren’t as limited by company policies about what they can change.</li>
        <li>In the early 2000s, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin reportedly clashed over how to handle spam and hate-fueled content. Page wanted the company to actively police it, while Brin wanted it left alone. Brin, the son of Jewish parents, also at one point decided to allow anti-Semitic sites to rank in search results, while Page at one point told a Google executive that Brin was going to “ruin” the company with his approach.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Google released a statement about the <i>Journal</i> article that reads, in part: “This article contains a number of old, incomplete anecdotes, many of which not only predated our current processes and policies but also give a very inaccurate impression of how we approach building and improving Search. We take a responsible and principled approach to making changes, including a rigorous evaluation process before launching any change — something we started implementing more than a decade ago.”</p>
