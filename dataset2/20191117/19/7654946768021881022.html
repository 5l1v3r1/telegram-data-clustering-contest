      <p>When the NFL set up this rematch from last season for “Sunday Night Football,” it figured it would be a dandy.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, the hangover for the Super Bowl loser has been real, as the Rams are just 5-4 and third in the NFC West, and their newly signed, $134 million quarterback, Jared Goff, is in the bottom of the league for QB ranking.</p>
      <p>It’s worse for their opponent, as the Bears are 4-5, own the 28th-ranked rushing offense and the No. 30 passing offense, and their quarterback, Mitchell Trubisky, ranks lower than Goff.</p>
      <p>A positive for both sides has been defense. The Bears’ Khalil Mack and the Rams’ Aaron Donald are probably the most valuable defenders in the NFL, and it is likely that this game will be dictated by the defenses.</p>
      <p>I believe the edge here comes on the defensive side and is in favor of the Bears, who allow just 17.4 points per game, fourth best in the league. This shapes up to be an ugly, defensive game in which points will be at a premium. I prefer to take the better defense and an underdog catching nearly a touchdown. I made this line Rams -5, and when I saw it open at Rams -7, I grabbed Chicago at the key number.</p>
      <p><b>The Play:</b> Da Bears, +6 ¹/₂ or better</p>
