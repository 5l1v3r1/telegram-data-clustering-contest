      <p>Robbo (Jake Ryan) has recently come face to face with Dylan Carter (Jeremy Lindsay Taylor), initially being held captive in a pit but soon turning the situation to his favour. Now the AFP cop has Carter held hostage, handcuffed to his truck.</p>
      <p>With Colby (Tim Franklin) and Jasmine (Sam Frost) wondering what’s going on, Robbo is carrying out a mysterious plan with Carter being used as leverage. He calls up Des (Matt Zeremes) to tell him he’s got Carter, but he will only hand him over if Victor (Patrick Thompson) gets involved.</p>
      <p>Once Robbo and Carter drive to the meeting place, just Des and his thugs show up, with Des asking Robbo to explain himself – as Victor suspects he’s playing games.</p>
      <p>Robbo tells Des that Dylan has made a confession detailing all of Victor and Des’ crimes. There’s enough information to see them both locked up for life. But if Victor shows up, he will hand over Dylan and make the confession disappear.</p>

      <p>Although Des hesitates, he agrees to the deal with Robbo threatens to call the confession in. Victor arrives and is angered that Robbo is trying to call the shots. He says Jasmine will be harmed if Dylan isn’t handed over immediately. However, Robbo asks him to answer one question – is he the man who killed his old family?</p>

      <p>When Victor realises Carter has confessed everything, he is uneasy and unsure of what Robbo’s game is. Des tells Victor to just confess the crime, as it’s not like Robbo’s stupid family didn’t deserve it. Enraged, Robbo draws his weapon, with Des’s thugs quickly doing the same.</p>
      <p>However, AFP officers suddenly appear on the scene, causing Victor, Des, Fitz (Nathan Sapsford) and the thugs to make a run for it. Robbo chases after Victor, eventually cornering him. Victor tells Robbo to just shoot him, as he doesn’t want to go to jail considering what they do to child killers there.</p>
      <p>He tries to goad Robbo by telling him his son’s final words and boasting about killing his family. Robbo struggles with his weapon. Will he contain himself, or is he about to murder his family’s killer – an eye for an eye?</p>
