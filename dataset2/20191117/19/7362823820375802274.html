      <p>That’s probably going to scare away the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/great-outdoors/fishing">fish</a>.</p>
      <p>A loose barge struck a fishing pier in Virginia, causing a portion of it to collapse.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, no injuries were reported from the incident.</p>

      <p>People on the fishing pier were forced to evacuate, however, as the barge got closer, <a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/hampton/buckroe-fishing-pier-collapses-following-loose-barge-strike/">WAVY</a> reported. Officials closed the beach to both foot and vehicular traffic.</p>
      <p>Initial reports of a loose barge started at around 5:40 a.m. this morning, but it apparently did not strike the pier until closer to 9 a.m.</p>
