      <p><b>Los Angeles: </b>Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden addressed more than 700 supporters here, aimed at consolidating base in the California city as part of his campaign for the party’s 2020 nomination. He opened his speech at the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College on Friday by addressing a deadly shooting that took place at a California high school on Thursday and led to the deaths of two teenagers and also the gunman who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reports Xinhua news agency. “What kind of a world is this?” Biden asked and vowed to take on the gun lobby if elected President, in an attempt to win anti-gun voters. He also warned that the income and opportunity gaps stemming from education inequality were dividing the country, saying the middle class was getting crushed and too many were jobless. (IANS)</p>
