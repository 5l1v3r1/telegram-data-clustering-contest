      <p>Kilmarnock striker Eamonn Brophy has been called into the Scotland squad after Lawrence Shankland pulled out with a minor injury.</p>
      <p>Shankland did not feature in Saturday’s 2-1 win in Cyprus with Steven Naismith starting up front and Oli McBurnie coming on just after the hour mark.</p>
      <p>A Dundee United statement read: “Lawrence Shankland has left the Scotland squad due to a slight injury picked up ahead of Saturday’s match v Cyprus.</p>

      <p>“He will return to the HPC (High Performance Centre) for assessment and is expected to be available for the Morton game.”</p>
      <p>Brophy, who has four caps and has scored three times for Killie this season, will come into the reckoning for Tuesday’s final Euro 2020 qualifier against Kazakhstan at Hampden.</p>
      <p>A draw would seal a third-placed finish for Scotland but they are looking for a third victory in succession to build confidence ahead of their play-off campaign in March.</p>
