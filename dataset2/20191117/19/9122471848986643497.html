      <h1>The Week 13 AP Poll Top 25 Has Been Released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:07:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The new AP poll is out, meaning both major sets of rankings have been updated following Week 12.</p>
      <p>Overall, Week 12 was rather uneventful in college football, with the status quo holding steady throughout the sport. Minnesota was the only top 10 team to lose as the Gophers suffered their first loss of the season at Iowa.</p>
      <p>Alabama and Georgia flipped spots in the top five this week, with the Bulldogs moving up to No. 4 and the Crimson Tide falling one place. Florida replaced Minnesota in the top 10, though the Gophers didn’t drop very far.</p>
      <p>This is your updated AP Top 25 after Week 12:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>LSU</li>
