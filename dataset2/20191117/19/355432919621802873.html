      <h1>Giuliani: Impeachment proceedings a 'travesty'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:47:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:47</time> by <a rel="author">Justine Coleman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>’s personal attorney <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> called the House impeachment proceedings a “travesty” in a tweet Sunday following the first week of public hearings.</p>
      <p>Giuliani, who some witnesses have testified was involved in the White House’s policy and pressure campaign regarding Ukraine, said the witnesses who testified publicly this week did not present any evidence of wrongdoing. </p>
      <p>“After 3 witnesses no evidence has been presented of any offense,” Giuliani posted. “The first two permanent diplomats had no direct knowledge just overhearing things. The third one had no knowledge not even hearsay. This is a travesty.”</p>

      <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a> and diplomats William Taylor and George Kent testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee this week in the first public testimonies of the impeachment inquiry. Yovanovitch testified that Giuliani was part of a campaign to push her out of her post.</p>
      <p>The House launched an impeachment inquiry into the president after a whistleblower report detailed a call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to look into former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> and his son after delaying military aid to the country.</p>
      <p>Original testimonies in the impeachment inquiry were held behind closed doors in front of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees. The House committees have released transcripts of some of those depositions.</p>
