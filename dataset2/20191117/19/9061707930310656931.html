      <h1>Hundreds of new homes to be built between Chellaston and Alvaston</h1>
      <h2>It's likely to be approved despite objections</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:03:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Zena Hawley</a></address>
      <p>Plans for an 800-home development on <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/alvaston">land between Alvaston</a> and <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/chellaston">Chellaston look set to get</a> the go-ahead on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The housing development, known as Snelsmoor Grange, is planned to be built in phases and the developers are looking for full planning permission to start work on 245 homes.</p>
      <p>They are seeking outline permission for the remaining 555 houses as part of what is called a hybrid planning application.</p>
      <p>It would be sited on land to the north of Snelsmoor Lane and south of Field Lane at Boulton Moor.</p>
      <p>To the east of the site, within South Derbyshire District Council's area, is another proposed housing site, known as Boulton Moor 2.</p>
      <p>The development also comprises of a country park and a primary school and would be accessed from a new roundabout on Snelsmoor Lane.</p>
      <p>The school would be sited on the edge of the green wedge and accessed from a new junction off Field Lane.</p>
      <p>The proposed country park would form the retained green wedge and would be located between the proposed housing and the recently completed Fellow Lands Way development.</p>

      <p>It would also contain a series of footpaths, cycleways, play areas, wildflower meadows and public orchards.</p>
      <p>The planning application was first lodged <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/derby-city-council">with Derby City Council</a> some six years ago.</p>
      <p>Since the original application, dating from 2013, in response to the then draft allocation of the emerging local housing plan, the proposal has undergone a lengthy period of negotiations and amendments.</p>
      <p>During that time, the council has received 41 public representations, one in support of the proposal and the others citing objections.</p>
      <p>These objections include the detrimental impact of the development on the green wedge and Green Belt; further development in the area cannot be sustained; loss of hedgerows and impact on wildlife; insufficient community facilities such as health centres; out-of-date traffic study; detrimental impact on traffic in "already congested Chellaston" and the impact of drainage plans on existing homes.</p>
      <p>Elvaston Parish Council has expressed concerns about the potential for flooding, which already exists in Elvaston and Ambaston and the lack of a primary school until phase two of the plan which will place presure on already congested schools in the area.</p>
      <p>The parish council says it has already received complaints about the present building at Boulton Moor 1, citing noise, disruption, traffic problems and inadequate drainage. This scheme will ultimately have almost 2,000 homes.</p>
      <p>Chellaston Residents' Association also has concerns about the proposed Snelsmoor Grange development which centre on traffic access from off Snelsmoor Lane and Field Lane and has suggested a bypass is built to prevent traffic congestion in Chellaston.</p>
      <p>It too has worries about a lac of school facilities at both primary and secondary levels.</p>

      <p>It objects to the application because it says the development will have a "severe impact on Chellaston".</p>
      <p>Property agents Raybould &amp; Sons point out the city council refused the demolition of three outbuildings and the building of one house because "it would be visually intrusive" on the Chellaston green wedge and asks the question: "If this is the response in respect of a single dwelling on the edge of the green wedge, how is it that the above application for 800 dwellings is still being considered as appropriate?"</p>
      <p>The estate agent response adds: "The character of Chellaston is rapidly disappearing and the loss of this open green area and the brutalising of Snelsmoor will be all but the final nail in the coffin."</p>
      <p>Planning permission was granted conditionally in September for alterations to the highway including the formation of a roundabout in connection with the proposed development of Snelsmoor Grange.</p>
      <p>The city council has already entered into negotiations with the developers, Bellway Homes and Clowes Developments, to provide a series of contributions during the life of the development.</p>
      <p>These include 10% affordable housing, 210-place primary school contribution, bus service contribution, country park with children's play facilities, High Street traffic calming contribution, footpath/cycleway contribution at the country park known as Hippo Park, funding towards secondary education and a travel plan.</p>
      <p>Other contributions to be considered at the end of the project could include an extension to Field Lane community centre, contribution towards Moorways sports centre and funding towards health provision.</p>
      <p>The planning control meeting to decide the application will take place in the Council House from 6pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Officers will recommend that councillors agree to let senior officers negotiate technical issues and the terms of section 106 agreement, including the developer's contribution to the project's infrastructure, including the park, schools and travel plan.</p>
