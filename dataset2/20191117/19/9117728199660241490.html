        <b>Max Verstappen says that he was pushed all the way by Lewis Hamilton at the Brazilian Grand Prix as he took a superb win from pole position as carange unfolded behind him in the dying laps.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Verstappen led from the start, but was undercut by Hamilton during the first pit stop after being held up by Robert Kubica in the pitlane, but the Dutchman was able to recover and overtake his Mercedes rival, and he steered clear of all the trouble behind him to cruise home for a third win of the season.</p>
      <p>Verstappen told Rubens Barrichello after the race: <i>"Lewis was very quick so I had to keep pushing and all the time.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"He pitted early so we had to be on top of our pitstops we had a good move on him. I could control the race with the tyres I had it was unbelievable it was a lot of fun out there and great to win the race."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I was behind so I was pushing flat out on my out lap I was close into the DRS and we knew we had great top speed the whole weekend already - but that was a guess - and I'm very happy to have got past."</i>
