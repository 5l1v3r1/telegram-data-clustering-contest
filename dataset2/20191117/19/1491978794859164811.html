        <i>Campaigners hail Alberto Fernández’s pledge to oversee U-turn in official policy</i>
      </p>
      <p>Argentina’s president-elect, Alberto Fernández, has promised he will move to legalise abortion after taking office on 10 December.</p>
      <p>He will send a bill to congress which, if approved, would make Argentina the first major Latin American nation with legalised abortion. The ruling in the 45 million-strong country would follow decisions by its much smaller neighbour Uruguay, which legalised the practice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/uruguay-legalise-abortion">in 2012</a>, and Cuba, in 1965.</p>
      <p>“I am an activist for putting an end to the criminalisation of abortion,” Fernández <a href="https://www.pagina12.com.ar/231474-alberto-fernandez-enviara-un-proyecto-de-legalizacion-del-ab">said in an interview</a> with the daily Página. “There’s going to be a bill of law sent by the president.”</p>
      <p>The announcement would represent a major U-turn for official policy in Argentina, which has steadfastly opposed legalisation. A bill presented by women’s rights activists was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/argentina-senate-rejects-bill-legalise-abortion">rejected by </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/argentina-senate-rejects-bill-legalise-abortion">the senate</a> by 38 votes to 31 last year, after the president at the time, Mauricio Macri, refused to endorse it.</p>
      <p>Fernández’s pledge was welcomed by equality campaigners in Argentina, where the struggle to end discrimination and violence against women has sparked a mass movement including a large number of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/argentina-women-south-america-marches-violence-ni-una-menos">women’s marches</a>.</p>
      <p>“I still can’t believe it’s happening,” said Ana Correa, a member of the #NiUnaMenos (“Not one less”, meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) collective, in a country where every 30 hours another woman becomes the victim of “femicide”, an Argentinian legal term encompassing domestic violence, “honour” killings and other categories of hate crimes against women.</p>
      <p>“The women’s movement is one of the most important political occurrences of the last four years,” Correa said, “and I think this time, with the backing of the new president, a legal abortion law will be finally enacted.”</p>
      <p>Pope Francis, who remains involved in the politics of his home country, has made no secret of his opposition to legal abortion and reportedly asked anti-abortion legislators to pressure fellow lawmakers to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/09/argentina-abortion-defeat-shows-enduring-power-of-catholic-church">reject last year’s bill</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina">Argentina</a> would also stand out as the first predominantly Catholic nation in the region – 92% of the population declared themselves Catholic in the last 2011 census – to legalise abortion. In Uruguay, 41% of the population is Catholic and in Cuba it is 60%. Abortion is also legal in South America’s English-speaking Guyana.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want this debate to be a dispute between progressives and conservatives, between revolutionaries and retrogrades, this is a public health issue,” said Fernández.</p>
