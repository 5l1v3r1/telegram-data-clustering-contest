      <p>Anna Wintour, the famous editor-in-chief of American Vogue is heading to Athens and will be the keynote speaker at the Vogue Greece “Change Makers” event focusing on inclusivity, women’s empowerment and sustainability in fashion.</p>
      <p>Wintour is one of the most powerful names in the industry and is set to discuss Vogue’s role in the future of fashion, as well as the initiatives undertaken by Condé Nast in the areas of ethical fashion and conscious consumerism.</p>
      <p>Condé Nast is a mass media and publishing company that produces some of the world’s most popular magazines.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Vogue Greece made a comeback hitting newsstands in March with its 26th international edition after a seven-year absence from the market due to the country’s economic crisis. The luxury magazine is run by 29-year-old editor-in-chief Thaleia Karafyllidou.</p>

      <p>The fashion bible’s US editor-in-chief since 1988, wrote a special note for the Greek comeback edition titled “Eyes on the future” which starred Bella Hadid on its cover, stating: “Dear Vogue Greece, welcome back again. Eyes on the future. Your return after years of absence fills us with joy. Greece faced problems and lived dramatic moments, I can only imagine how tough it was. However, the signs of recovery are now visible, even here in America.”</p>

      <p>At the special event, Wintour will be joined by leading fashion personalities, including Cara Smyth and Dana Thomas, along with established Greek designers. Thomas is a fashion and culture journalist and author of “Fashionopolis” a book about her global research into the true cost of fast fashion and the future of clothes. The book not only has a Greek-inspired title but also features a Greek statue on its cover. With many local and international couture houses drawing from Grecian inspiration for their design collections, using the backdrop of the Acropolis and ancient ruins for their editorials and runways, Greece is increasingly becoming a fashion favourite for style creators across the globe.</p>
      <p>Greece’s leading designers, celebrities and socialites will be in attendance later this month to witness Wintour in her element.</p>
      <p>The invitation-only event will be held on November 27 at the Athens Concert Hall.</p>
