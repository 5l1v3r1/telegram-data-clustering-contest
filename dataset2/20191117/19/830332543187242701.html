      <p>(CNN) - Harry Styles put on quite a show Saturday, hosting "Saturday Night Live" and performing his new single "Watermelon Sugar."</p>

      <p>"Watermelon Sugar," which was released on Saturday, is the second single off of his upcoming studio album "Fine Line."</p>
      <p>Earlier in the show, Styles performed the first single, "Lights Up."</p>
      <p>The British heartthrob also appeared in a number of skits, in which he poked fun at his love life and even threw shade at his former band mates.</p>
      <p>"I love those guys, they are my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis ..."
