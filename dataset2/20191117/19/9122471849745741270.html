      <h1>Betting Line Released For Ohio State-Penn State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:34:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State will meet with the Big Ten East on the line next Saturday in Columbus. The Buckeyes are the favorite in that game.</p>
      <p>Matter of fact, they are heavily favored. The betting line for Ohio State-Penn State has been released, and Ohio State is “giving” over three touchdowns worth of points to the Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/odds/las-vegas/line-movement/pennsylvania-state-@-ohio-state.cfm/date/11-23-19#BT">Vegas Insider</a> and Circa Sports, Ohio State is a 19-point favorite over PSU.</p>

      <p>Note: for some reason, the Circa Sports tweet above lists the kickoff time for Ohio State-Penn State as 5 p.m. West Coast time. It is actually at noon ET and 9 a.m. PT.</p>
      <p>Ohio State has won six of the last seven matchups against the Nittany Lions, with Penn State beating the Buckeyes in Happy Valley in 2016 on their way to a Big Ten title.</p>
      <p>Including that 2016 game, the last three meetings have been instant classics, all decided by three points or less. Ohio State has won the last two games by one point apiece.</p>
      <p>Vegas is expecting they will win by a lot more than that on Saturday.</p>
