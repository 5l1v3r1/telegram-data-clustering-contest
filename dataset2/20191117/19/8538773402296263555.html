      <p>England captain <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/142200/Harry-Kane">Harry Kane</a> scored his 12th goal of the campaign as they secured a place among the top six seeds for next year's European Championship with a somewhat flattering 4-0 win in Kosovo in their final qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>England were in second gear for much of the match as <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/202332/Harry-Winks">Harry Winks</a> put them ahead in the 32nd minute, but late goals by Kane, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/230945/Marcus-Rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/231167/Mason-Mount">Mason Mount</a> secured another big win and took the team's goal tally to an impressive 37 from eight qualifiers.</p>
      <p>England, already through to the Euro 2020 tournment in which the semi-finals and final will be held at Wembley, finished top of Group A with 21 points, the only blip being last month's 2-1 loss away to the Czech Republic, who qualified as runners-up.</p>
      <p>Kosovo finished third on 11 points. Their chances of automatic qualification disappeared after a 2-1 defeat by the Czechs on Thursday but they could advance via the playoffs.</p>
      <p>"It was a tight game and a good test for us really," said England manager Gareth Southgate. "It was a difficult pitch, with players slipping and passes going astray.</p>
      <p>"We needed a tighter game and a challenge. I'm happy we got that. We had to sustain spells of pressure and gave them chances -- on another night that would be a problem. But attacking we were ruthless."</p>
      <p>England took a while to impose themselves on the game but broke through when <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/145392/Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> slid a pass into the path of Winks who had all the time and space needed to slot the ball into the bottom corner for his first international goal.</p>
      <p>Two months ago England led the corresponding home fixture 5-1 at halftime but their somewhat sloppy display on Sunday, lacking intensity, left them way short of those levels.</p>

      <p>Kosovo, who exposed England's defence a few times in their 5-3 defeat in September, were less threatening but unmarked captain <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/205576/Amir-Rrahmani">Amir Rrahmani</a> headed wide early in the second half.</p>
      <p>Kane, who got a hat-trick in Thursday's 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro, was on target again in the 79th minute with a sharp shot after Kosovo failed to clear a <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156366/Raheem-Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> cross.</p>
      <p>His 12th goal made him the leading scorer across the competition and the first England player to score in every match of a qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>Sterling, back in the side after his one-match ban for attacking team mate <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/102053/Joe-Gomez">Joe Gomez</a>, was provider again three minutes later for Rashford, who scored with a neat first time shot.</p>
      <p>Substitute Mount then claimed his first England goal in stoppage time, cashing in on another defensive error and a neat pass from Kane.</p>
      <p>"We had already won the group so the mentality was not easy to go again but I thought we managed it well," Kane said.</p>
      <p>"We went through spells where they had pressure but we were clinical and 4-0 is a great result."</p>
