      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - An insurer for a trucking company involved in a crash that killed seven motorcyclists is asking a judge to divide liability payments among victims and their families.</p>
      <p>The Boston Globe reports that Pilgrim Insurance Co. filed suit in federal court Friday asking a judge to divide its $1 million policy for Westfield Transport.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy was driving for Westfield in June when he collided with a group of 10 motorcycles in New Hampshire, killing seven. He has been charged in their deaths.</p>
      <p>Pilgrim's suit details 15 claims from victims and their families. The company says it's unable to determine amounts to be paid and wants the court to decide.</p>
      <p>It also asked a judge to relieve Pilgrim of its duty to provide legal defense to the trucking company.</p>
