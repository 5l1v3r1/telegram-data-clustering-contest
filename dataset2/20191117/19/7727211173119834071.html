      <h2>Many were quick to have their say after we stayed the night at the hotel</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:16:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/catherine-murphy/" target="_blank">Catherine Murphy</a></address>
      <p>Investment, an upgrade and a return to its previous high standards - these are just some of the suggestions ECHO readers believe is needed to help Liverpool's Adelphi hotel.</p>
      <p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> spent the night at the hotel, which is owned by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/bosses-adelphi-pontins-never-respond-16489800">Britannia Hotels</a> to see what the experience was like after being heavily criticised by some guests.</p>
      <p>On the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/theliverpoolecho">ECHO's Facebook page</a> , hundreds of our readers left comments under the article calling the hotel's decline a "shame".</p>
      <p>It's unsurprising it caused huge a big reaction as the Adelphi Hotel has been a symbol of Liverpool for decades.</p>

      <p>As much as the Liver Building, Lime Street Station or our historic football grounds, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/adelphi-hotel">the Adelphi</a> means something to this city - and to the millions of people who come to visit every year.</p>
      <p>This is why so many are keen to see it restored.</p>
      <p>Carole Ryan said: "So sad this beautiful hotel has been so run down but all the hotels in this chain are much the same. Wouldn't stay in any. It's a shame because it was once the place to be in Liverpool. Wish someone could bring it back to its former glory."</p>
      <p>Lisa Alman said: "This is such an iconic hotel. It should be invested in and upgraded."</p>

      <p>Sarah Brown added: "It's an absolute shame that such an iconic hotel has been just left to go to ruin.</p>
      <p>"When I was little I always told my mum I wanted to stay there one day. There is no way I would stay there now. It needs a big cash injection to get it all sorted and back to its high standards."</p>
      <p>And, Pauline Fenwick said: "Needs a good makeover. I don't know how people can stay in there. It's a shame because it's got a lot of history and it could be a lovely hotel."</p>
