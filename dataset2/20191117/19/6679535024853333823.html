      <p>The Dalai Lama will deliver a talk on ‘Overcoming Anger and Anxiety’ at St. Columba’s School on November 20. The event is being hosted by the Tushita Mahayana Meditation Centre as part of its 22nd Dharma Celebration.</p>
      <p>“There is great significance to such an event. Not only does it reinforce awareness of the strong spiritual bonds between India and Tibet, going back to the 8th Century when Buddhism was transmitted to Tibet through the painstaking efforts of a host of great Masters and translators from both nations, but it also awakens us to the enduring legacy of the Nalanda Buddhist tradition and its relevance to the thinking public of today at a time when people are searching for deep answers to life’s issues in a period of major changes and challenges,” the organisers said.</p>
      <p>The event will begin from 10 a.m.</p>
