      <p>BINGHAMTON (WBNG) — American Legion Post 1194 held their annual turkey dinner Sunday in Binghamton.</p>
      <p>The dinner is organized each year as an opportunity for members to not only share a Thanksgiving meal with their families but also show their appreciation to the Legion Riders and the Auxiliary for the work they do to keep the post open and operating at a time when many posts around the country are closing.</p>
      <p>“We want the sons and the auxiliary and the legion riders to know that we appreciate everything they do to keep us going,” said Post 1194 member Steve Illsley.</p>
      <p>Illsley says he has been a member of the post for more than fifty years.</p>
