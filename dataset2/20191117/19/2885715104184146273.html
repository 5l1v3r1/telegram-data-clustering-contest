      <h1>Mumbai Confidential: Blue-Eyed Boy</h1>
      <h2>In July this year, Sachin Kurve, a 2003-batch IAS officer from the Uttarakhand cadre, was appointed as the Secretary to Fadnavis.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:15:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sandeep-a-ashar/" target="_blank">Sandeep A Ashar</a></address>
      <p>In 2014, after the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> came to power in Maharashtra, Sachin Kurve, a 2003-batch IAS officer from the Uttarakhand cadre, was handpicked by Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a>. Perceived among his colleagues as Fadnavis’ “blue-eyed boy”, Kurve went on to serve as Collector in Fadnavis’ home district of Nagpur and then in the suburbs of Mumbai. In July this year, he was appointed as the Secretary to Fadnavis. With President’s Rule, Kurve has secured another plum assignment, being deputed to Raj Bhavan to assist Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in disposal of the files of the state administration. Incidentally, Koshyari is also a former chief minister of Uttarakhand.</p>
      <h3>Taken To Task</h3>
      <p>Congress president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sonia-gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a> was miffed with Maharashtra Congress leaders for directly reaching out to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a> this past week, sources say. She is said to have conveyed her disapproval to the leaders, pointing out that she had already made it clear that the Congress-NCP were to first sit together to evolve consensus over the idea of joining hands with the Shiv Sena to form a non-BJP government in Maharashtra. State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat, former CM Ashok Chavan, and former state president Manikrao Thakre had independently met Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray in a suburban hotel this past week.</p>
      <h3>Giving It A Miss</h3>
      <p>Senior BJP leader and former minister Pankaja Munde was conspicuous by her absence at a party meeting last Saturday of those who had lost in the Assembly polls. She failed to retain her Parli seat, tasting defeat at the hands of her cousin Dhananjay, who is with the NCP. While the meeting, which was presided over by former CM Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil, was meant to review the reasons behind the loss, her absence meant that the exercise could not be carried out for the Parli seat. Party sources admitted equations between Fadnavis and Munde, who has never hidden her chief ministerial aspirations, had soured over the last five years.</p>
      <h3>The Last Leg</h3>
      <p>Amid continuing uncertainty over government formation, Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve’s extended tenure is coming to an end this month end. In August, the Appointments Committee of the Union Cabinet had sanctioned a three-month extension for Barve, a 1987-batch IAS officer, citing Assembly elections and saying that the order had been issued as a “special case” in public interest. With the tenure coming to an end on November 30, all eyes are on the Centre for the decision in this regard.</p>
      <h3>Talking Cricket</h3>
      <p>Politics and cricket often go hand-in-hand. This past week, senior BJP leader <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nitin-gadkari">Nitin Gadkari</a>, while likening cricket to politics, said anything could happen in politics and cricket as those who appear to be losing the match might actually win, in what was seen as a veiled reference to the evolving political situation in Maharashtra. But Gadkari’s googly didn’t faze NCP president Sharad Pawar, who was up to it. Pawar, a former BCCI president, when asked to respond, quipped, “I’m an organiser. I do not play cricket, I make others play.”</p>
