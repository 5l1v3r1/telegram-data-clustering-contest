      <h1>BIS says water unsafe, BWSSB claims otherwise</h1>

      <p>Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has claimed that it supplies “clean and safe water” only after testing it every day, in response to a study by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) which has deemed the water supplied in the city unsafe.</p>
      <p>BWSSB officials said 16 parameters are tested every day. The water utility has two laboratories where these tests are conducted — at High Grounds and at Jayanagar. Raw water is also tested at Thorekadanahalli, they said.</p>
      <p>BWSSB chairman Tushar Girinath said it was important to first ascertain where the water samples were taken from. Ten samples were reportedly collected from across the city and tested on 28 parameters prescribed for drinking water standards of the BIS notified in 2012, but the samples failed on five parameters — turbidity, presence of aluminium, calcium, bromo-trichloromethane, and coliform.</p>
      <p>“We will seek a report of the study, apart from ascertaining the locations from where the samples were collected. Only then can remedial action be planned,” he said.</p>
      <p>Water conservationist S. Vishwanath said broadly the water supplied by the BWSSB was safe. “The real problem is cross-contamination from sewage and intermittent supply,” he said, and explained that intermittent supply creates a negative vacuum and sewage gets drawn in through cracks. The solution to this, he said, lay in ensuring 24/7 supply.</p>
      <p>Y.G. Muralidharan from the Consumer Rights Education and Awareness Trust said the BWSSB was duty bound to ensure supply of safe and potable water. “Merely increasing water tariff is not its duty,” he said, and demanded transparency in safety parameters. The BWSSB, he said, routinely tests water quality and it must make public the results.</p>
      <p>Mr. Girinath said the BWSSB would take a decision on putting water quality test results on public domain, at a meeting scheduled on Monday.</p>
