      <h1>Video of Kobe Bryant's daughter Gigi destroying entire defense, draining fadeaway surfaces</h1>

      <p>The apple does not fall far from the tree in the Bryant household, apparently.</p>
      <p>Kobe Bryant was known for his signature fadeaway during his tenure in the NBA. It was a shot that was nearly indefensible, as Bryant would gain separation, then calmly jump back and sink jumpers with ease.</p>
      <p>Apparently, he taught it to his daughters as well, as we recently learned.</p>
      <p>His 13-year-old, Gigi, showed that during a recent game, when she took on more than half the opposing team, then still sank a contested fadeaway jumper.</p>
