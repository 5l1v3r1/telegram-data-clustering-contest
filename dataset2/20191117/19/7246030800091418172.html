      <h1>Your Attitude Counts Too</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:01:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/sivan-rahav-meir/" target="_blank">Sivan Rahav-Meir</a></address>
      <p>A wise friend of mine, a mother of small children, recently said:</p>
      <p>“No matter what, we have to make sandwiches and drive our kids to kindergarten every day. Our choice is how we do this – stressed out or with joy, in bitterness or with enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>“From Avraham Avinu, we learn to do everyday tasks with eagerness and joy. To become excited by the routine. See how the Bible describe Avraham hosting strangers whom he invites into his tent:</p>
      <p>‘And Avraham hurried to his tent, to Sarah, and he said, ‘Quickly, take three se’ah of meal and fine flour; knead and make cakes.’ And Avraham ran to the cattle, and he took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the youth, and he hurried to prepare it.’</p>
      <p>Avraham hurries and runs and makes others eager to join him in speedy preparation for the feast. He dances with the dishes as he serves his guests, as if he had just won a prize. More than his guests enjoy the meal, Avraham enjoys fulfilling the mission for which he was created – to help others.</p>
      <p>“Avraham teaches us that life is not just a question of what you do, but also how you do it.”</p>
      <p>
