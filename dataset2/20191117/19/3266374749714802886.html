      <h3>Argentina and Uruguay will go head to head against each other in an all-South American clash at the Bloomfield Stadium in Israel on Monday.</h3>
      <p>After a statement win over their age-old rivals Brazil, Argentina will now take on another South American rival in Uruguay on Monday at the Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>
      <p>The <i>Albiceleste</i> have not lost a match in 2019 ever since their exit from the Copa America and they will look to carry forward this form when they face Uruguay. Lionel Scaloni has formed a team full of hardworking players and has found the perfect blend of experience and youthful exuberance with Lionel Messi being the driving force.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Uruguay have also been a formidable force ever since their shock exit in the Copa America semifinals against Peru. Just like the <i>Albiceleste</i>, Oscar Tabarez’s men have also not lost a single game since the Copa America and they will look to continue that form against a resurgent Argentina.</p>
      <p>Both sides are coming to this game with wins, as Argentina defeated their arch-rivals Brazil in a close affair, while Uruguay playing out a 2-1 win over Hungary. Therefore it will be a test of character for both sides and despite being friendly, it is set to be a fiercely contested game.</p>
      <h3>Team News &amp; Tactics</h3>
      <h4>Argentina</h4>
      <p>With no tournaments around, Scaloni will get the freedom to try out different players in his system and eventually build a settled starting eleven. Esteban Andrada will take charge between the sticks while Spurs defender, Juan Foyth has seamlessly slotted in right-back position making the position his own for club and country.</p>
      <p>Nicolas Tagliafico has also done a great job for Scaloni at left-back with Nicolas Otamendi and German Pezzella forming the centre-back pairing.</p>
      <p>Leandro Paredes ought to keep his place in the middle of the park with Giovani Lo Celso being his partner in crime, as the latter is vested with the responsibility of orchestrating play. Scaloni may be tempted to try out some new names with Nicolas Gonzalez starting ahead of Lucas Ocampos on the right flank with Rodrigo De Paul likely to keep his place.</p>
      <p>Lautaro Martinez started against Brazil ahead of Sergio Aguero and the Manchester City man may again start from the bench with Scaloni pairing Lucas Alario alongside Lionel Messi. The Argentine talisman will drop deep and will have the license to roam around the final third while Alario will be the main man up top.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Probable Lineup (4-2-2-2):</b>
        <i> Andrada, Foyth, Otamendi, Pezzella, Tagliafico; Lo Celso, Paredes; Gonzalez, De Paul; Messi, Alario</i>
      </p>

      <h4>Uruguay</h4>
      <p>Oscar Tabarez will be missing some of his key players in this fixture, with the likes of Nahitan Nandez, Giorgian De Arrascaeta, Jonathan Rodríguez and Darwin Núñez all sidelined. However, the biggest absentee comes in the form of Atletico Madrid defender Jose Maria Gimenez who is still recovering from the injury he sustained a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p><i>La Celeste</i> are coming to this game on the back of a 2-1 win over Hungary and will look to go with an unchanged eleven. Fernando Muslera has been their mainstay for a few years now with Giovanni González and young Matias Vina taking the full-back spots. Sebastien Coates will slot in for Gimenez as Diego Godin will look to marshal the backline.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid’s Fede Valverde will look to replicate his club form in national colours with Rodrigo Bentancur adding more steel to the Uruguayan midfield. 19-year old winger Brian Rodriguez will keep his place on the right flank with his namesake, Brian Lozano taking up the left flank.</p>
      <p>Uruguay’s main strength lies in their attack with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani leading the line for Oscar Tabarez’s side.</p>
      <p><b>Probable Lineup (4-4-2):</b> <i>Muslera; González, Coates, Godín, Viña; Rodríguez,  Valverde, Bentancur, Lozano; Suárez, Cavani</i></p>

      <h3>Key Stats</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Argentina hold a superior record against Uruguay in one of the old South American rivalries, with the <i>Albiceleste</i> winning 87 matches to Uruguay’s 57 wins.</li>
        <li>The last five matches have ended with Argentina winning thrice and Uruguay registering a single win in the period with the last outing ending in a 0-0 draw.</li>
        <li>Luis Suarez has been involved in half of Uruguay’s goals in his last 8 appearances for <i>La Celeste</i>.</li>

      <p>The 19-year old right-winger has been very impressive since his debut for the national team. The Los Angeles FC winger has scored thrice in five appearances under Oscar Tabarez and will look to continue that form against Argentina. Rodriguez has literally been the new kid in the block for Uruguay and he has made his own identity in a team full of superstars.</p>
      <p>His goals against USA, Peru and Mexico have come in crucial stages of the game and despite being young he has shown great maturity and made the right-wing position his own. His promising performances for the South American giants prove that he is here to stay for long.</p>
      <h3>Prediction</h3>
      <h4>Argentina 2-1 Uruguay</h4>
      <p>It is set to be a feisty clash between two formidable sides who have managed to keep their perfect record since their Copa America exits. However, with the form Messi is in right now it will be difficult for Uruguay to keep him at bay and almost all of Argentina’s attack involves the Barcelona man and with one of their main defenders in Jose Maria Gimenez missing from this game, it will be difficult contain Scaloni’s men.</p>
      <p>The onus will be on the Suarez-Cavani combination upfront to find the back of the net with players like Brian Rodriguez adding more attacking impetus. The Hard Tackle predicts a 2-1 win for <i>La Albiceleste</i>.</p>
