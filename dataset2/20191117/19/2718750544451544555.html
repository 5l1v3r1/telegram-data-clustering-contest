      <h1>Don’t Tell Bosley How Terribly <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> Is Doing at the Box Office</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:29:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">Devon Ivie</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/movie-review-charlies-angels-starring-kristen-stewart.html">empty corporate feminism</a> of the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/charlies-angels-reboot-trailer-kristen-stewart.html"><i>Charlie’s Angels </i>reboot</a> is equating to very empty pockets for Sony executives. The film, starring <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/kristen-stewart-movies-prove-shes-always-been-a-great-actress.html">Kristen Stewart</a> and relative big-screen newbies Ella Balinska and Naomi Scott, is currently bombing at the box office at an alarming rate not seen since the <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/05/why-were-doomed-to-remember-that-bees-are-dying-globally-at-an-alarming-rate.html">slow genocide of bees</a>. Per data compiled by <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/charlies-angels-bombs-at-box-office-reasons-why-1202787938/">Deadline</a>, the Elizabeth Banks–directed film took in a shockingly low $8.6 million in the U.S. since its Friday release date, with only $27.9 million being added internationally. (At least the soundtrack <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/listen-ariana-grandes-charlies-angels-soundtrack.html">is pretty good</a>!) What <i>is </i>doing terrific numbers in theaters this weekend, though, is <i>Ford v Ferrari, </i><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/ford-v-ferrari-movie-review-an-old-fashioned-rouser.html">which stars</a> Christian Bale and Matt Damon as sunglass-clad racing rivals who want to drive really, really fast in 1963. (Bale even gets to use <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/ford-v-ferrari-christian-bale-talks-in-his-real-voice.html">his real voice</a>.) The sports drama finished in first place at the U.S. box office with a cool $31.5 million, and added $52 million for its global total. Vroom vroom!</p>
