      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order gets kicked up a notch with a custom motion controller</h1>

        <b>If you’re following along with Rich’s <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/review">review-in-progress for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, you’ll know that the newest Star Wars game on the block leans heavily into its lightsaber combat – reminiscent, Rich says, of the furious swordplay in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Exciting as that is, at the end of the day you’re still pushing buttons. What if you got to swing Cal’s saber yourself?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Twitch streamer Rudeism has figured out a way to do just that. Using a custom-made controller set up, he’s able to navigate Fallen Order’s dungeons, use Cal’s force powers, and wield a lightsaber the way he might in real life. Well, sort of.</p>
      <p>Using a motion-sensitive lightsaber held in his right hand, and a wired-up glove in the other, Rudeism takes a few initial steps in the video clipped below in a tweet. Starting the game up next to two stormtroopers, Rudeism ignites his saber with a shake from his right hand, then swings the device – Cal follows suit on screen, dispatching the two troopers with flashes from his own lightsaber.</p>
      <p>Rudeism immediately shrieks with glee.</p>

      <p>While Cal’s motions aren’t mirroring Rudeism’s, there’s enough movement required by the custom controllers to give what appears to be a very satisfying Jedi experience. Swishing his left hand forward, palm open, he shoves aside a stone door in an ancient tomb.</p>
      <p>“That is so fun to do,” he says. And it sure <i>looks </i>like a lot of fun to do.</p>
      <p>The clip wraps up with some footage of his fight with boss Oggdo Bogdo, and Rudeism seems able to move about the arena fairly nibly using the thumbstick mounted in the glove’s palm.</p>
