      <h2>Likud lawmaker believes unity government likely to form - despite Yair Lapid's alleged efforts to derail a compromise deal.</h2>

      <p>Likud MK David Bitan is optimistic that a national unity government will ultimately be established, preventing a third election within less than 12 months, despite what he claimed were MK Yair Lapid’s efforts to block the establishment of such a government.</p>
      <p>Speaking with <i>Arutz Sheva</i> at a right-wing gathering in Tel Aviv Sunday, Bitan blasted the Blue and White party, accusing them of seeking to form a government with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu at any cost.</p>
      <p>“All that Blue and White cares about is making a government under their leadership, even if that creates serious economic or security problems,” said Bitan.</p>
      <p>The Likud lawmaker accused the center-left Blue and White party of not making a good-faith effort to form a unity government with the Likud.</p>
      <p>“Blue and White doesn’t want a national unity government, they want a government without Netanyahu, their own government; and then they’ll head back to elections, with the only difference being that they hold the premiership instead of Netanyahu. They know that any minority government won’t last longer than a month.”</p>
      <p>Bitan rejected claims that the Blue and White party was looking for Likud MKs to break ranks and help form a government led by Benny Gantz.</p>
      <p>“It won’t happen. It can’t happen, and the bill which would permit it – by allowing less than one-third of a party to break away and form a government – is also just spin. There’s no truth in it at all. There is nothing like that happening in the Likud.”</p>
      <p>Bitan blamed the ongoing political deadlock, which has left both Netanyahu and Gantz unable to form a unity government, on Blue and White MK Yair Lapid.</p>
      <p>“Lapid is torpedoing any chance of a unity government.”</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Bitan believes a unity government may still ultimately be formed, while rejecting the possibility of a narrow right-wing government being formed at the last moment with the support of Avigdor Liberman and his Yisrael Beytenu party.</p>
      <p>“The public doesn’t want another election, so everyone will come together. A minority government has no chance – only a unity government does.”</p>
