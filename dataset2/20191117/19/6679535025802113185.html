      <h1>JNUSU was kept in the dark: Umesh Kadam</h1>
      <h2>‘Administration open to dialogue, but can’t have it with ‘non-notified’ students’ union’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:46:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Umesh Kadam, Dean of Students at Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday said that the JNU Students’ Union representatives were not invited for the inter-hall administration meeting held on October 28 as the university had not notified the students union for the year.</p>
      <p>He added that the JNU administration was open to dialogue with elected hostel representatives but not with the “non-notified” students’ union to end the stand-off by students over the hike in hostel fee.</p>
      <p>“The JNUSU election results are still lying with me in my office in a sealed envelope. The election committee announced the results without taking that sealed envelope from me. How can we notify the students’ union when the results are still with me,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kadam was speaking at a press conference organised by “concerned” faculty members of the university who said that they were working to end the strike by students on the campus so that academic life could resume.</p>
      <h3>‘Politically motivated’</h3>
      <p>Also present at the conference was Vandana Mishra, Associate Dean, who alleged that she had been confined to her classroom for 29 hours by protesting students last week.</p>
      <p>Sharing her experience, Ms. Mishra said that the entire protest was politically motivated as during the time she was confined by students to her classroom, none of them wanted to discuss matters relating to changes in the hostel manual.</p>
      <p>“The students were only interested in calling me names and were alleging that I was affiliated to certain political outfits. They never engaged me in a discussion about the hostel rules or hostel fee hike. This shows that it is only a protest with political animosity.”</p>
      <p>She added that students have every right to protest democratically but the protests that were going on were not democratic.</p>
      <p>“You cannot reason with a mob of students. If they want to discuss or debate any point in the manual, they must do so through proper channels. The JNUSU has not been notified by the university. It is the elected hostel presidents that need to come forward and discuss matters and they were the ones who were invited to the IHA meet.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kadam said that the university was only following guidelines from the UGC that directed universities to generate internal receipts for hostels.</p>
