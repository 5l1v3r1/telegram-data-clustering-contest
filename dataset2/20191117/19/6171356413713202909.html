      <h1>The Xperia 10 Plus is $350 ($49 off) right now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:24:06+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>In this crazy world we live in, it helps to remember that somethings never change: the sun rises in the east, the sky is blue, and Sony phones get their prices slashed a few months after release. Now you can grab the mid-range Xperia 10 Plus for just $349.99, a $80 discount from the original MSRP, and a $50 drop from the usual price.</p>
      <p>The Xperia 10 is equipped with a Snapdragon 636 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a headphone jack (hooray!) and a 6.5-inch 2520x1080 IPS LCD with an aspect ratio of 21:9. There are a total of three cameras, two on the back (12MP regular, 8MP depth sensor), and one 8MP wide-angle lens on the front. Carrier compatibility is fairly good, as it will work with all major US networks except Sprint. Sony says the phone should get Android 10 <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/15/sony-android-10-update-timeline/">sometime in 2020</a>.</p>

      <p>Our review of the Xperia 10 Plus (and its smaller sibling) pointed out the high-quality display and lightweight software experience, though the 21:9 aspect ratio might be inconvenient for some.
