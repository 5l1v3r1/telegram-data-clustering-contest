      <h1>Neil Warnock mic'd up: Unprecedented access reveals tender and passionate side of ex-Cardiff City man just weeks before he left</h1>
      <h2>The former Bluebirds boss was the subject of a short film for BT Sport this weekend</h2>

      <p>Neil Warnock admits he's "frightened" by the possibility of walking away from football.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff City</a> boss was the subject of BT Sport's Mic'd Up series over the weekend, which aims to give viewers an up-close-and-personal look at what makes some of the game's most well-known managers tick.</p>
      <p>Warnock left the Bluebirds by mutual consent earlier this week, bringing an end to a highly successful three-year spell that will see him celebrated as one of the club's greatest-ever managers.</p>
      <p>Shot before his exit, Warnock candidly admits he's struggling with the prospect of retirement, despite previously indicating that the Bluebirds post would be his last job in the game.</p>
      <p>When quizzed by presenter Jake Humphrey about whether he could ever walk away from football, the 70-year-old said: "I don't know how I'm going to do it.</p>
      <p>"It's no use me saying 'I'll just call it a day and go fishing' etc.</p>
      <p>"It's when I go round and thank all the fans in all the areas and I get that buzz.</p>

      <p>"I don't know where I'm going to get that from.</p>
      <p>"People say when you retire that's it, you're on your way out then.</p>
      <p>"So it does frighten me a bit. It's bound to."</p>
      <p>The extent of the Yorkshireman's packed schedule is laid bare in front of the cameras, including his daily workout, which leaves recent arrival Armand Traore in awe.</p>
      <p>"It's unbelievable," he says. "I've been a little bit injured and I see him here [in the gym] quite often and I know full well when I'm in his age, you won't see me in the gym!"</p>
      <p>Warnock clearly has a big rapport with his players, jokingly telling striker Robert Glatzel that the team "played well without him" while he was out through illness, before sharing quips with Sol Bamba, Aden Flint and Marlon Pack.</p>

        <figcaption>It's clear Warnock enjoyed a strong rapport with some of his players, including Sol Bamba</figcaption>

      <p>Nevertheless, despite the positivity, there's a noticeable intensity on show when Warnock referees a training match between the players, with Josh Murphy on the end of a particularly heavy challenge.</p>
      <p>"That's how I want them to play, really," he explains.</p>
      <p>"I like people taking people on. I like wingers. I like excitement, crosses, shots.</p>
      <p>"There's not a bad egg in there. They're just a great group."</p>
      <p>There are plenty of preconceptions about Warnock's style of management, some of which are addressed by Humphrey in front of the cameras.</p>
      <p>It's clear that far from being the 'old school' footballing dinosaur that many of his critics claim, Warnock is very open to new techniques, particularly when it comes to analysis.</p>
      <p>One segment sees him sit down and dissect the games of Gavin Whyte and Omar Bogle, but it seems that only scratches the surface of his methods.</p>
      <p>"I would say he's one of the most forward-thinking managers we've worked for," is the claim from analyst Patrick Deboys.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, despite the demands of his schedule in the capital, it's clear that he still made time for the fans.</p>
      <p>In one heartwarming segment, he instructs his PA to ensure that a matchday mascot receives a shirt after previously missing out, with viewers also getting a look at the mountains of letters he receives every day.</p>
      <p>PA Victoria McCracken says: "He's been there. Seen it. Done it.</p>

      <p>"Nothing phases him. Press-wise or requests.</p>
      <p>"He has loads of letters on a daily basis and he will answer every single one of them. If there's a contact telephone number on there, he'll call some of these people up.</p>
      <p>"Some of the reactions we've had have been unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Warnock's next move remains to be seen, with reports in Scotland suggesting he is keen on taking the job at Scottish Premiership side Hearts.</p>
      <p>One thing's for sure, his passion for the game remains as strong as ever.</p>
