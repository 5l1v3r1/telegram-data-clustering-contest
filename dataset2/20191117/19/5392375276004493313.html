      <p>The Huawei Mate 30 series appears to have become one of the most successful devices launched by the Chinese phone maker in the past years. Or at least we assume so by looking at the amount of effort Huawei is putting into its advertising.</p>
      <h3>Three Short Films Shot on the Huawei Mate 30 Series Coming on November 20th</h3>

      <p>The latest promotional stunt is indeed quite ambitious. Huawei is planning to launch at total of three movies shot entirely on the Mate 30 Series. The movies are going to unveiled at the 28th Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival taking place in Xiamen, Fujian.</p>
      <p>The three movies are part of the program Huawei calls “Mate 30 Reconstructed Imagination” and will be shown on November 20th. The short movies are “Your Look”, “Badain Jaran” and “Swim to Spring”; they’ll be up on the screens of the No. 7 in Vientiane Studio, Xiamen. If you’re in the area, you can actually watch the movies between 1PM and 3PM.</p>

      <p>The most interesting movie of the three is probably “Badain Jaran” as it was supervised by one of the directors at the Golden Bear Award of the Berlin Film Festival. While the movie “Swim to Spring” was directer by the young Ren Yongqiang. The story is about the struggle for a young man to find the way back home; the movie has a duration of 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>As we previously mentioned, all the clips in the movies have been shot on a device from the Huawei Mate 30 Series, most likely the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/30/huawei-mate-30-and-30-pro-will-launch-in-europe-in-mid-november-without-google-apps/">Mate 30 Pro</a>. The smartphone equips a primary 40MP ( Cine Camera, f/1.8 aperture) plus a 40 MP (SuperSensing Camera, f/1.6 aperture, OIS). We then have 8 MP (Telephoto Camera,OIS, 3x Optical Zoom) and 3D Depth Sensing Camera supports Autofocus. The handset supports AIS (HUAWEI AI Image Stabilization) and can shoot 4k HDR+ and 7680fps ultra slow videos.</p>
