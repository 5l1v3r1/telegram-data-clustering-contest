      <p><b>Auckland:</b> The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will hit the ground running in Auckland on Monday on their week-long tour of New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The royal couple were met by Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy on Sunday afternoon, landing at Whenuapai air base after a visit to India.</p>

      <p>Their first event of three dozen engagements is a wreath-laying ceremony at Mount Roskill War Memorial Park in Auckland's South, a memorial to the fallen of World War I.</p>
      <p>They will then retire to the Wesley Community Centre for a cultural welcome, before heading their different ways in the afternoon, pursing causes of their personal interests.</p>
      <p>Charles's focus on environmental issues, especially plastic waste, will take him to visit Critical Design, a social enterprise which creates jobs through waste reduction.</p>

      <p>Camilla will meet with organisations dedicated to active ageing, as well as those supporting women who have suffered from domestic violence.</p>
      <p>They will spend the afternoon at a sustainably-focused winery, Hunting Lodge, before returning to Whenuapai for military presentations.</p>
      <p>There are only three opportunities for the public to engage with the Prince and Duchess this week; during public walks at Auckland's Viaduct Harbour on Tuesday, Christchurch's Cathedral Square on Friday and Kaikoura on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The visit comes as Prince Andrew, Charles' brother, comes under fresh global scrutiny for his relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew participated <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bf9.html">in a BBC interview, seeking to rebut claims he had sex with an underaged, trafficked girl, that has been branded a public relations disaster</a>.</p>
