      <h1>Transfer Rumour: PSG considering Bosman move for Adam Lallana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T19:45:11+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/varun-madhav/" target="_blank">Keshav Awasty</a></address>
      <h3>PSG are reportedly eyeing a free transfer for Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana, whose contract at Anfield is set to run down next summer.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197">Daily Mirror</a>, Adam Lallana is the subject of interest from PSG, who are viewing a move for the Englishman with next summer’s transfer window in mind. But, curiously, <i>Les Parisiens</i> are considering the Liverpool midfielder as a replacement for Edinson Cavani, who looks set to join LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>From being a regular to becoming an afterthought, Adam Lallana has suffered a stunning drop in stature at Liverpool. England’s Player of the Year in 2016, injuries have taken a toll on the midfielder, who has only managed to feature from the kick-off 11 times since the start of the 2017-18 season.</p>
      <p>With his contract with Liverpool set to run out at the end of the season, there is a growing feeling that the 31-year-old is featuring in his final campaign for the Reds. Widespread reports have also <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/10/20/transfer-rumour-liverpool-to-look-to-move-adam-lallana-off-the-books-next-summer">suggested that Liverpool are ready to offload Lallana</a> and PSG are ready to pounce on his situation, as per the report.</p>

      <p>The interest from PSG comes as a bit of a surprise, though, particularly considering that according to Daily Mirror, the beleaguered Liverpool star is being viewed as a replacement for Edinson Cavani, who is reportedly set to join LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>It is curious as to how Lallana, a midfielder, would be a replacement for Cavani, a striker, even as PSG already have Mauro Icardi, Kylian Mbappe and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as the other options to lead the line. As far as midfield is concerned, Thomas Tuchel seems to have ample options at his disposal as well.</p>
      <p>All things considered, PSG do not seem to have a need for Lallana, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/04/transfer-news-mls-chinese-clubs-eyeing-liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana">who is also reportedly being courted by MLS and Chinese clubs</a>. Nevertheless, with his Liverpool deal expiring next summer, the Englishman will be free to negotiate with foreign clubs, including PSG over a Bosman move.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see if there’s any truth to the rumours linking Lallana with PSG, particularly as Edinson Cavani’s replacement. For now, what appears to be certain is that the 31-year-old is nearing the end of his stint with Liverpool.</p>
