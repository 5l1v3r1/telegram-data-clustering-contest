      <p>Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings earned his second senior cap as England secured a European Championship top-seed spot with victory over Kosovo today (Sunday).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tyrone-mings">Mings</a> played the full 90 minutes of a 4-0 win in Pristina, partnering Harry Maguire at centre-half.</p>
      <p>Harry Winks fired the Three Lions into a first-half lead, before Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount struck in the final 20 minutes to secure England's seventh group A win from eight.</p>
      <p>John Stones had made Gareth Southgate's starting XI for Thursday's 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro - but Mings was back at the heart of the defence in England's final competitive fixture before next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>Here is what the national media made of the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> centre-back's performance, with ratings out of 10...</p>

      <p><b>6</b> - Struggled for an hour. He certainly deserved another run-out after handling himself so well on and off the pitch in Bulgaria but he endured a difficult game, particularly in the first half.</p>
      <p>He was beaten early on in the air by Nuhiu and some of his passing was sloppy.</p>
