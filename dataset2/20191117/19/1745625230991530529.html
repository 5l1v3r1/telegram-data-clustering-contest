      <h3>Rachel Cook Exposes Chest While Perched On A Rock Formation At The Beach</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/rachel-cook/">Rachel Cook</a> left little to the imagination in her newest Instagram update, which showed her going topless. She sat perched on the edge of a large rock formation at the beach, with the ocean visible behind her. The <i>Playboy</i> stunner wasn’t shy about showing off her topless look either, as she sat facing the camera. Meanwhile, she placed her hands in front of her shorts, leaving her chest completely exposed. She censored it with white lettering that read “WTVR,” but that didn’t completely cover her.</p>
      <p>The model did, however, wear a pair of denim shorts. She also rocked a pair of dark green sneakers, as she bent her left knee and extended her right leg. Rachel wore her hair down in a middle part, while her locks fell down the front of her shoulders. In particular, some of her hair covered the side of her chest on the left side. She looked off into the distance to her left, with a moody expression on her face.</p>
      <p>The photo appeared to have been shot on a cloudy day, as the sky was glowing white. Rachel’s toned body looked tan in the image, as she’s seemingly kept up her bronzed color even in the colder months.</p>
      <p>This update is too revealing to share here, but it’s available on the model’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-kyB4JPLv/">Instagram</a> page.</p>

      <p>Fans left tons of compliments, while many focused on the caption.</p>
      <p>“Killing it Rachel! Love those kicks,” gushed a follower.</p>
      <p>“Yes…..front row, won’t miss it,” promised an admirer, referring to the live feed.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <p>“Can’t wait!! The sneak peaks are so stunning!” raved a fan.</p>
      <p>“You have your own magazine?” asked a fourth Instagram user.</p>
      <p>The <i>WTVR Magazine</i> is created by Rachel herself, and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wtvr/">Instagram</a> feed for the publication mentioned that it’s “coming soon.” The photos that have been posted so far feature many risqué snaps of the bombshell. In addition, she shared a photo that she took of another model for the magazine, so it’s possible that many different girls will be included.</p>
      <p>In addition, Rachel teased her fans a few days ago with another <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5742383/rachel-cook-topless-photo/">topless pic</a>. This time, she was seen posing indoors. She didn’t seem to be wearing much makeup and went topless while censoring herself with her arms. At the very least, it looked like she was wearing mascara and glossy lipstick. She hugged herself with her left arm, while placing her right hand by her lips. The model wore her hair loose and falling down her back.</p>
