      <p>After just two episodes His Dark Materials has already established itself as THE drama to watch in the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>The TV adaptation of Phillip Pullman's classic novels of the same name, started on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bbc">BBC1</a> in early November and continues on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Secrets and dangers lie ahead for young Lyra Belacqua in an epic tale of stolen children and the mysterious substance of Dust.</p>
      <p>Episode 1 saw Lyra's world turned upside-down by her long-absent uncle's return from the north, while the glamorous Mrs Coulter visits Jordan College with a proposition.</p>
      <p>In episode 2 Lyra started her new life in London, determined to find Roger with Mrs Coulterâ€™s help. The Gyptians continue their search for the missing children and the elusive Gobblers.</p>
      <p>And then in the third installment, airing on BBC1 on November 17, from the clutches of the Gobblers, Lyra finds help from an unlikely source, which helps her piece together more about her past and keep safe from the Magisterium.</p>
      <h3>How many episodes of His Dark Materials are there?</h3>
      <p>There are a total of eight episodes of the BBC drama, each airing on Sunday nights and lasting an hour.</p>
      <p>In episode 4 Lyra and the Gyptians arrive in the North and seek the help of the Witches' Consul, Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby and an armoured bear in service to the town.</p>
