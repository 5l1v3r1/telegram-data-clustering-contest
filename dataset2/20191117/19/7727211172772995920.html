      <p>This Morning celebrity chef Gino D'Acampo has been sporting a new look of late, but it seems to have reached its peak and fans don't all approve.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old has been wearing a bandanna and viewers of the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> daytime <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tv">TV</a> show have already poked fun at the Italian for his new accessory.</p>
      <p>But, it seems he has gone a step too far for some who took a dim view to the dad-of-three wearing the headgear with a tuxedo.</p>
      <p>Posting a snap of himself with his two sons on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , fans immediately piled in with comments about his choice of fashion.</p>
      <p>He had previously told This Morning viewers that he was wearing the kerchief, which originates from India, while he 'grows his hair out' and instead of a chef's hat.</p>

      <p>He told Holly Willoughby: "I’m in and out of the kitchen all the time, so instead of wearing a chef's hat I’ll wear this. Don’t you think it’s cool?"</p>
      <p>But his reasoning hasn't stopped fans' jibes, one, coulsonlesley said: "Why the bandanna?"</p>
      <p>Another, lou_c_welsh said: "What the f*** are you wearing that stupid bandanna for? It makes you look ridiculous. I think you're covering something up. There's no way a grown ass man would wear that s*** lol."</p>
      <p>A third, tinapayne1280 said: "Lovely photo but what with the bandanna??"</p>
      <p>Another, jacquie11 said: "Oh please just stop with this bandanna nonsense..."</p>
      <p>And another, angelatancock added: "What’s with the bandanna. You're not in the kitchen."</p>
      <p>Gino has been a regular chef on This Morning for over a decade and has 12 cookbooks and a number of successful restaurants across the UK.</p>
