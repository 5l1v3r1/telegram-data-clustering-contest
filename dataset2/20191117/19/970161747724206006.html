      <p>Oh to be a fly on the wall as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ryan-reynolds/">Ryan Reynolds</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/blake-lively/">Blake Lively</a> met <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mariah-carey/">Mariah Carey</a> and her kids, Moroccan and Monroe.</p>
      <p>In a meeting we never even knew we needed to see until today, Moroccan (nicknamed Rocky), 8, dressed up as Deadpool as the family posed with the celeb couple.</p>
      <p>Mariah posted the picture to her 8.6 million Instagram followers and wrote in the caption: ‘Rocky snuck up on an unsuspecting couple wearing a Deadpool mask. Will they ever recover?’</p>
      <p>Then, as if things couldn’t get any better, Ryan replied: ‘Whoa. My vision board became a photo.’</p>
      <p>Beautiful.</p>
      <p>People then began flooding Mariah’s Instagram comments section with their excited reactions.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote: ‘Dahhhling you are winning at life!’</p>
      <p>While another replied: ‘So awesome you got to meet @mariahcarey and her kids. Roc will never watch Deadpool the same now.’</p>

      <p>Then another suggested: ‘I’m a big Deadpool fan. Please get Mariah to sing the soundtrack for Deadpool 3. That would be amazing!’</p>

      <p>This latest celebrity meeting comes just days after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/mariah-carey-surprises-kids-millie-bobby-brown-meeting-revealing-stranger-things-obsession-11127446/">Roc and Roe met Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown</a>.</p>
      <p>Mariah wrote in the caption: ‘Roc and Roe’s best day of their 8 year old lives! Thank you @milliebobbybrown for this moment, we had a blast!’</p>
      <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/blake-lively-wipes-entire-instagram-account-and-leaves-nothing-but-a-cryptic-film-trailer-11171346/">Blake deleted every single post on her Instagram</a> except for the trailer of her upcoming film, The Rhythm Section.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/01/queen-instagram-blake-lively-deletes-every-single-one-posts-confused-7511735/">did a similar stunt in May last year</a> to promote her film, A Simple Favor.</p>
      <p>Something tells us Blake won’t be reposting Mariah Carey’s pic of her anytime soon…</p>
