      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Diamonds ETF set its all-time intraday high of $279.95 on Nov. 15 with its quarterly risky level at $285.57.</li>
        <li>The Spiders ETF set its all-time intraday high of $311.84 on Nov.15, well above its monthly and quarterly pivots at $305.88 and $306.76.</li>
        <li>The QQQ ETF set its all-time intraday high of $202.91 on Nov. 15 with its monthly pivot and quarterly risky level at $202.70 and $203.80.</li>
        <li>The Transports ETF is between its semiannual, quarterly and annual pivots at $193.47, $195.40 and $196.35, but below its all-time high of $209.43 set on Sept. 14, 2018.</li>
        <li>The Russell 2000 ETF is trading back and forth around its semiannual, annual and quarterly pivots at $156.14, $157.49 and $158.88, well below its all-time high of $173.39 set on Aug. 31, 2018.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When I analyze the Dow 30 only Apple (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL">AAPL</a>), Microsoft (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT">MSFT</a>) and United Technologies (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTX">UTX</a>) set new highs as the Dow closed above 28,000 on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>Disney (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS">DIS</a>) and Walmart (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT">WMT</a>) set new highs earlier in the week but no new highs on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>In fact, most Dow stocks declined last week. The depth of strength is thus thin, as the rally is not lifting all stocks.</p>

Diamonds has a positive but overbought weekly chart with the ETF above its five-week modified moving average at $272.31. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 83.24 last week, up from 76.89 on Nov. 8. Its annual pivot is $257.94 with its monthly and semiannual pivots at $270.01 and $272.78 and quarterly risky level at $285.57.</p>

      <p>The Spiders ETF is 33.4% above its Dec. 26 low of $233.76, which was a "key reversal" day buy signal. Spiders has a positive but overbought weekly chart with the ETF above its five-week MMA at $303.05. Its 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 89.93 last week, up from 85.26 on Nov. 8. This reading will rise above the 90 threshold this week which will make the ETF an "inflating parabolic bubble."

      <h3>How to use my value levels and risky levels</h3>
      <p>Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on Dec. 31. The original annual level remains in play.</p>
      <p>The mid-year close resulted in the second half semiannual level.</p>
      <p>The monthly level changes at the end of each month, the latest on Oct. 31. The quarterly level was changed at the end of September.</p>
      <p>My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in.</p>
      <p>To capture share price volatility, investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.</p>
      <h3>How to use 12x3x3 Weekly Slow Stochastic Readings</h3>
      <p>My choice of using 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon back-testing many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years.</p>
      <p>The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading and I found that the slow reading worked the best.</p>
      <p>The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. Recently I noted that stocks tend to peak and decline 10% to 20% and more shortly after a reading rises above 90.00, so I call that an "inflating parabolic bubble" as a bubble always pops. I also call a reading below 10.00 as being "too cheap to ignore."</p>
