      <p>Argentina’s president-elect, Alberto Fernandez, has promised he will move to legalise abortion after taking office on December 10th.</p>
      <p>He will send a bill to congress which, if approved, would make Argentina the first major Latin American nation with legalised abortion. The ruling in the 45 million-strong country would follow decisions by its much smaller neighbour Uruguay, which legalised the practice in 2012, and Cuba in 1979.</p>
      <p>“I am an activist for putting an end to the criminalisation of abortion,” Mr Fernandez said in an interview with the daily Pagina. “There’s going to be a bill of law sent by the president.”</p>
      <p>The announcement would represent a major U-turn for official policy in Argentina, which has steadfastly opposed legalisation. A bill presented by women’s rights activists was rejected by the senate by 38 votes to 31 last year, after the president at the time, Mauricio Macri, refused to endorse it.</p>
      <p>Mr Fernandez’s pledge was welcomed by equality campaigners in Argentina, where the struggle to end discrimination and violence against women has sparked a mass movement including a large number of women’s marches.</p>
      <h3>Predominantly Catholic nation</h3>
      <p>“I still can’t believe it’s happening,” said Ana Correa, a member of the #NiUnaMenos (“Not one less”, meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) collective, in a country where every 30 hours another woman becomes the victim of “femicide”, an Argentinian legal term encompassing domestic violence, “honour” killings and other categories of hate crimes against women.</p>
      <p>“The women’s movement is one of the most important political occurrences of the last four years,” Ms Correa said, “and I think this time, with the backing of the new president, a legal abortion law will be finally enacted.”</p>
      <p>Pope Francis, who remains involved in the politics of his home country, has made no secret of his opposition to legal abortion and reportedly asked anti-abortion legislators to pressure fellow lawmakers to reject last year’s bill.</p>
      <p>Argentina would also stand out as the first predominantly Catholic nation in the region – 92 per cent of the population declared themselves Catholic in the last 2011 census – to legalise abortion.</p>
      <p>In Uruguay, 41 per cent of the population is Catholic and in Cuba it is 60 per cent. Abortion is also legal in South America’s English-speaking Guyana.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want this debate to be a dispute between progressives and conservatives, between revolutionaries and retrogrades, this is a public health issue,” said Mr Fernandez. – Guardian</p>
