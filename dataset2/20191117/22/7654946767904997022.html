      <p>The “Iranian Hulk” is set to unleash his fury in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.</p>
      <p>Internet sensation Sajad Gharibi — an extreme bodybuilder from Iran with an outrageously puffed-up physique  — has joined the boxing fight club, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/17/20968703/bare-knuckle-fighting-championship-announces-iranian-hulk-for-2020">according to MMA Fighting on Sunday.</a></p>
      <p>Gharibi, 27, also known as the Persian Hercules, is set to debut next year, BKFC President David Feldman said.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to do a show entitled ‘USA vs. Iran: World War III,’ ” Feldman said. “[Gharibi] is literally our biggest signing we’ve ever had.”</p>
      <p>Gharibi gained fame in 2016 not only for his bizarre behemoth build but because he <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/07/04/this-bodybuilder-is-ready-to-kick-isis-ass/">vowed to join the fight against ISIS.</a></p>
