      <p>Two years. It has been two years today since <i>Justice League</i> came out and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1727409/justice-league-box-office-the-dceu-takes-a-hit-while-wonder-surprises">disappointed almost everyone</a>. On the 2nd anniversary of that mess, fans <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484985/fans-get-release-the-snyder-cut-trending-on-justice-leagues-2-year-anniversary">got #ReleaseTheSnyderCut trending</a> as part of an organized push to get Warner Bros. to release director Zack Snyder's original vision for the DC movie. But fans were't alone. Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, finally joined the chorus.</p>
      <p>Gal Gadot picked the perfect time to show her support for the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement, posting a photo of Diana Prince on <a href="https://twitter.com/GalGadot/status/1196167460501671936">Twitter</a>:</p>

      <p>Gal Gadot's <i>Justice League</i> co-star Ray Fisher (Cyborg) has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484404/why-this-could-be-a-huge-week-for-justice-leagues-release-the-snyder-cut-movement">posted in support</a> of The Snyder Cut release before, and he did it again on the anniversary of the November 17 movie debut:</p>

      <p>Christina Wren played Major Carrie Farris in Zack Snyder's <i>Man of Steel</i> and <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i>. She shared her support for Snyder's <i>Justice League</i> cut:</p>

      <p>Actress/martial artist Samantha Win was in <i>Man of Steel</i> and played Euboea in <i>Wonder Woman</i> and <i>Justice League</i>. She too showed solidarity for the movement:</p>

      <p><i>Justice League</i> and <i>Aquaman</i> star Jason Momoa has been the most vocal of the group about getting the Snyder Cut released. He said he's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">seen it and it's very different</a> from the theatrical version finished by Joss Whedon. Momoa already posted this image a week before the two-year anniversary event:</p>

      <p>What about Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, and Ezra Miller? Affleck is no longer playing Batman in the DCEU. Ezra Miller still supposedly <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478483/dont-worry-ezra-miller-says-the-flash-movie-is-absolutely-confirmed">has his <i>The Flash</i> movie coming</a>, but he's not on social media. Henry Cavill's status as Superman is still unclear. Cavill did address The Snyder Cut last year <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2452420/henry-cavill-doesnt-think-zack-snyders-justice-league-cut-would-make-a-difference">in an interview</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>I don't know if [a Snyder cut] actually exists so the only way I can look at it is as a business model, and I don't know what difference it's going to make. There are stories to be told, which need to be told and adjustments that can be made, but that's not going to make any difference</blockquote>
      <p>Apparently The Snyder Cut does exist, 'cause Jason Momoa recently confirmed he'd seen it. Zack Snyder's preferred social medium is Vero, where he has been dropping more <i>Justice League</i> photos and intel than ever in the past couple of months. Snyder just recently posted <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484947/supermans-resurrection-teased-by-zack-snyders-latest-snyder-cut-image">a new shot of Superman's resurrection</a>.</p>
      <p>Zack Snyder said he was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481693/zack-snyder-speechless-over-release-the-snyder-cut-efforts-at-new-york-comic-con">"speechless" from the support of fans</a> at New York Comic-Con, and I can only imagine his heart is growing several sizes from the support of his own cast and fans today. Last month, he did return to Twitter to show support to fans, so I wouldn't be surprised if he did something like this in honor of today:</p>

      <p>But now what? How long is this going to continue? I saw fans tagging both Warner Bros. and the upcoming streamer HBO Max on tweets, perhaps with the hope that WB will drop The Snyder Cut on the new service. It would certainly make a splash. But will that ever happen? I don't see why Snyder would keep teasing fans with images if he didn't want it to be released. But will it? I'm trying to find the endgame (sorry!) in this campaign that works out for everyone involved.</p>
