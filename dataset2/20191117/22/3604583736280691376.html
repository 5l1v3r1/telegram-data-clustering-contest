      <p>They don't make shows like this anymore.</p>
      <p>From the woodchop, to the dog jump to the grand parade, the Clunes Show is one of those days out that are becoming rarer by the year, but with a committee full of generations of locals, it is one show that is not slowing down.</p>
      <p>The whole Clunes community came out to celebrate its big day out with president John Drife saying the gate proved to be almost identical to last year which was a "big event".</p>
      <p>"This is a great community show," Mr Drife said.</p>
      <p>"I've been president for a couple of years, my great great grandfather was on the board. There are quite a few families who have been involved through the generations.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of new people involved and what's great to see is there's lots of young people, next year's president is a former president's daughter and she's only 30.</p>
      <p>"I've been involved with a lot of stuff with fire brigade and things like that and this is good a committee I've been involved in."</p>
