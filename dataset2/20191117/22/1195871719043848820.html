      <h1>Brand new ​Tag Heuer smartwatches set for early 2020 launch</h1>
      <h2>A second report puts a follow up Tag Heuer Connected beyond doubt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:59:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:59</time> by <a rel="author">James Stables</a></address>
      <p>Tag Heuer has confirmed there will be a new launch of a third generation Tag Heuer Connected next year.</p>
      <p>Wareable had <a href="https://www.wareable.com/android-wear/tag-heuer-connected-smartwatch-2020-release-date-price-specs-7622">previously reported that a new version was set to be released in March 2020</a> – and that’s been backed up in a report by WatchPro – which has curiously since been deleted. You can see a cached version <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:H-jw4SHxoR8J:https://www.watchpro.com/exclusive-tag-heuer-ceo-vows-to-keep-faith-with-connected-smartwatches/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">here</a>.</p>
      <p>WatchPro quotes Stéphane Bianchi, chief executive of TAG Heuer and the LVMH Watchmaking Division, as saying:</p>
      <p>“We will have two major launches in 2020: a new Connected watch and a new Carrera. Those are going to be big, big launches next year,” Bianchi is quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>“New Connected watches will be unveiled in February and we will focus on the Carrera at Baselworld,” he continued.</p>
      <p>That points to an announcement ahead of the March Baselworld show, of which LVMH is a major exhibitor.</p>
      <p>At Wareable we previously reported that a former Google employee had been quoted in a Business Insider look at the Wear OS roadmap as saying a new Tag Heuer Connected was due for March 2020.</p>
      <p>That same source highlighted that Tag Heuer has struggled to make a big impression with its smartwatch line-up – with sales amounting to 15,000 of its first generation and 50,000 of the second.</p>
      <p>While those numbers are small fry for tech giants – potentially disastrous in fact – it’s important to remember that for the Swiss watch manufacturers producing at price points with such high margins, it’s a different story. As such - Tag Heuer clearly feels it can continue the traction it's built.</p>
      <p>Will we see a cheaper watch, designed to introduce more people into the Tag brand? Don't count on it.</p>
