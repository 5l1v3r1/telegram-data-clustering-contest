      <h2>PM lashes out at political rivals at Likud emergency rally over potential cooperation with Joint List; Blue and White headship call on Netanyahu to dissolve right-wing bloc</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:41:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">Moran Azoulay, Roi Rubinstein, Yuval Karni and Hassan Shaalan</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reprobated on Sunday the possibility that Blue and White may form a minority government supported by the predominately Arab Joint List, calling it a 'historic national disaster'.</p>
      <p>"We are in a fateful moment for the State of Israel," said Netanyahu at an emergency rally for Likud supporters, in Tel Aviv. "The heads of Blue and White â€“ Benny Gantz, Gabi Ashkenazi and (Moshe) Bogie Ya'alon have decided to form a minority government which will be contingent upon the members of the Arab Joint List.</p>

      <p>"If such a minority government is formed - Tehran, Ramallah and Gaza will celebrate as they celebrate after each terror attack. It would be a historic national disaster for the State of Israel, and we cannot allow this".</p>
      <p>Netanyahu than personally addressed Gantz, a former IDF chief, and claimed that the Arab MKs want to prosecute him; alongside Gantz's predecessors Ashkenzai and Ya'alon; for alleged war crimes committed by the IDF during their tenures.</p>
      <p>"I want to make it clear to you (Gantz), they want to prosecute you as a war criminal, as well as Gabi Ashkenazi and Bogie Ya'alon. This is a slap across the face to your electorate and a serious violation of Israeli democracy".</p>
      <p>"You must show national responsibility, so I call upon you to address the people and rule out the ludicrous idea of a government that relies on the members of the Arab Joint List. Most understand the danger. What we need is unity, not minority".</p>
      <p>In his speech, Netanyahu did not mention Yisrael Beitienu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman, with whom he met shortly before the rally.</p>

      <p>The heads of Blue and White met during Netanyahu's speech on Sunday at the party's headquarters in Tel Aviv. The party had issued a response to the things said by the incumbent at the Likud rally.</p>
      <p>"The citizens of southern Israel did not get an 'emergency rally', nor the patients lying neglected in hospital corridors, the elderly or people with disabilities. As usual, Netanyahu cares only about Netanyahu".</p>
      <p>Blue and White MK Yair Lapid, second in line to Gantz, called Netanyahu to form a unity government with Blue and White, if the idea of a minority government scares him so much.</p>
      <p>"If Netanyahu is so hysterical over the idea of a minority government, he should come and form a unity government with us," said Lapid. "He should break up with his ultra-Orthodox-messianic bloc, agree to serve second (as prime minister in a rotation deal with Gantz) and we will have a good civil unity government that will work for the benefit of the citizens of Israel within 48 hours.</p>
      <p>It was our aim from day one and remains so to this day. The only problem is that Netanyahu has decided, on his lawyers' advice, to go to elections, and he does everything in his power so that the State of Israel will go to the polling stations".</p>
      <p>Joint List leader Ayman Odeh slammed on Sunday Netanyahu over his speech, calling the prime minister a 'bitter criminal and a sore loser'.</p>
      <p>"There will be no 'Benjamin Junction' or a "Netanyahu High School'. Netanyahu has sealed his legacy tonight as a bitter criminal and a sore loser who only insults and incites against those he's supposed to serve. We, the Arabs and our Jewish partners, will breathe a sigh of relief on the day Netanyahu leaves and we'll continue to fight for peace, equality, democracy and social justice".</p>
