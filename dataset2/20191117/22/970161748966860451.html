      <h1>The War Of The Worlds: 5 questions we need answered after episode 1</h1>

      <p>The War Of The Worlds kicked off with an explosive episode that set the (scorched) scene for the rest of the series.</p>
      <p>George (Rafe Spall) and his partner Amy (Eleanor Tomlinson) were enjoying their quiet life in Woking, until it became not so quiet when mysterious meteors fell out of the sky.</p>
      <p>Rather than leave well alone, they along with other free thinkers and astronomer Ogilvy (Robert Carlyle) decided to poke it, setting of a destructive chain of events that led to the arrival of massive aliens that destroyed everything in their path.</p>
      <p>So what are they? Where did they come from? And why are they intent on wiping out human life?</p>
      <p>And more importantly, is the dog okay?</p>
      <p>Here are the questions we have after episode one.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is the middle of an alien invasion the best time to talk about a wedding?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Yes we get that George and Amy are in love and want to make it official, but maybe try surviving first before talking about getting shot of George’s wife?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is George’s wife in trouble?</b>
      </p>
      <p>George and Amy are ‘outcasts’ in their village because they are living together while unmarried. George’s estranged wife, devastated by George leaving her for Amy, declared that she will only grant her journalist husband a divorce when she’s dead. We have a horrible feeling she might come to regret those words in coming episodes.</p>

        <b>Will George and Amy reunite?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The couple were split up in the midst of the alien attack, and Amy rode off find George’s brother Frederick (Rupert Graves). Will they make their way back to each other?</p>
      <p>
        <b>What happened to Benny?</b>
      </p>
      <p>While fleeing their home under fire from aliens, Amy pleaded with George to go back for their dog Benny. As George made his way to him, here was thrown off course by another blast. Poor Benny was no where to be found. Did he save their poor pet pooch?</p>

      <p>
        <b>What did those pictures mean?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amy stumbled upon some mysterious photographs that were being kept by Ogilvy. Could they be important later on? Did Ogilvy know what was going to happen?</p>
