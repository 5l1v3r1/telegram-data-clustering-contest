      <h1>Man hit in face by scooter as Trump supporters, protesters clash in California</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:09:19+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/owen-daugherty" target="_blank">Owen Daugherty</a></address>
      <p>A man who was demonstrating in support of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> over the weekend was hit in the face with a scooter by an anti-Trump protestor, <a href="https://lbpost.com/news/politics/live-updates-the-california-democratic-convention-in-long-beach">according to witnesses who spoke with the Long Beach Post</a>.</p>
      <p>The news outlet reported that the incident took place Saturday as Trump supporters and opponents clashed near the site of the California Democratic Convention.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear who initiated the fight, the news outlet noted, but witnesses said one of the anti-Trump protesters hit a Trump supporter in the face with a manual scooter during the clash.</p>
      <p>“It happened really fast,” Raul Rodriguez Jr., who was holding a sign in support of Trump’s reelection, told the Long Beach Post.</p>
      <p>About a dozen Trump supporters stood outside the Long Beach Convention Center, where the event was being held, using bullhorns and chanting, “Four more years!”</p>
      <p>Rodriguez said two men came up to him and the other Trump supporters and started “harassing” them.</p>
      <p>In a tweet addressing the incident, the Long Beach Police Department said it "is committed to ensuring everyone’s 1st Amendment rights, but we also want to remind you that any violence of any kind will not be tolerated in our community."</p>

      <p>Three people were taken into custody, and all three were charged with assault with a deadly weapon that was not a firearm, the department’s public information officer, Arantxa Chavarria, told the news outlet.</p>
      <p>Two people involved in the incident were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment for lacerations, Chavarria added.</p>
      <p>Eight Democratic presidential candidates were in attendance at the convention on Saturday.</p>
