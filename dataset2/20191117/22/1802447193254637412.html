      <p>The 49ers began Sunday like they had a hangover. Who can blame them?</p>
      <p>They played a game Monday night that went to the wire, with the Seahawks winning on the final play of overtime.</p>
      <p>San Francisco had 10 plays for 2 yards on its first three possessions as the Cardinals built a 16-0 lead.</p>
      <p>The 49ers, though, scored on their last two possessions of the half to cut the Cardinals’ halftime lead to 16-10. They finished the half with 124 yards.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13522/ross-dwelley">Ross Dwelley</a> caught a 4-yard pass from <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9360/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> with 7:52 left in the second quarter. Dwelley caught 16-yard pass he thought was a touchdown on the 49ers’ next drive, but center <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9534/weston-richburg">Weston Richburg</a> was called for holding.</p>
      <p>The 49ers ended up settling for a 43-yard <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/14618/chase-mclaughlin">Chase McLaughlin</a> field goal.</p>
      <p>San Francisco will receive the second half kickoff.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13950/kyler-murray">Kyler Murray</a> has passed for 108 yards and run for 45. He is 15-for-21 with a pair of touchdowns, hitting <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/1661/larry-fitzgerald">Larry Fitzgerald</a> for a 5-yard score and <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11281/pharoh-cooper">Pharoh Cooper</a> for a 5-yard score.</p>
      <p>The Cardinals have 167 yards.</p>
      <p>The teams played two weeks ago on Thursday Night Football, with the 49ers taking a 28-14 lead into the fourth quarter and winning 28-25 as Garoppolo threw for 317 yards and a career-best four touchdowns.</p>
