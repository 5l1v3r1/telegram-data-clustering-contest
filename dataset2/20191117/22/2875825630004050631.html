      <p>Ant McPartlin made his big return to I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! tonight after missing last year's series.</p>
      <p>He had been forced to pull out following his drink-drive shame earlier on in 2018, leaving Declan Donnelly to co-host alongside Holly Willoughby.</p>
      <p>And viewers were divided about whether they preferred the Ant and Dec comeback or if they missed Holly after all.</p>
      <p>One Ant fan tweeted: "I loved Holly stepping in for Ant last year but I am super excited that the boys are back together this year &amp; have loved the bants between them so much already."</p>
      <p>"Anyone missing Holly &amp; Dec presenting #ImACeleb," a team Holly devotee said.</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "I'll be honest....am quite missing Holly."</p>
      <p>An Ant supporter posted: "I thought I’d miss Holly but there’s actually nothing better than Ant &amp; Dec."</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "So lovely to see Ant back on I’m a Celeb, Holly was fab but it just wasn’t the same."</p>

      <p>Ant had decided to take a break from his TV presenting duties to focus on his recovery.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said: "My recovery is going very well and for that to continue having spoken to Dec and ITV, I have made the decision to take the rest of the year off."</p>
      <p>He returned to TV in January 2019, just after Holly filled in for him in Australia.</p>
