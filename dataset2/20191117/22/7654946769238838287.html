      <p>An 18-year-old Illinois hockey player died of complications from mononucleosis hours after playing while under the weather, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Chicago Fury player Gabe Remy was rushed to the hospital with a ruptured spleen last week after ignoring signs of the fatal illness, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/teenage-athlete-suddenly-dies-mono-playing-hockey-game/story?id=66974158">ABC News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Though he was suffering from flu-like symptoms, Remy had insisted to his coach that he attend the youth team game, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>“He was excited to play,” coach Al Dorich told the outlet. “We love our guys to be aggressive and to go out there and compete hard, and he never had a problem competing.”</p>
      <p>Dorich said spectators wouldn’t have known Remy was sick from his performance in the hockey match.</p>
      <p>“If it was your first time watching him you wouldn’t have known the difference,” he said.</p>
      <p>But within hours, Remy had to undergo emergency surgery for a ruptured spleen, the outlet reported. He died later that day at the hospital, less than 24 hours after the game.</p>
      <p>Experts say it can be dangerous with mono to engage in strenuous workouts since the condition causes the spleen to become enlarged and can put patients at risk for injury, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4000473/">according to the National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>
      <p>Someone should not have any physical contact because of the risk of rupturing the organs, something that was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/12/medical-reasons-why-sam-darnold-will-be-out-for-a-long-time/">experienced by Jets quarterback Sam Darnold</a> at the beginning of this season.</p>
      <p>Remy’s teammates said he wasn’t aware that he was suffering from mono and his Nov. 10 death came as a shock to them.</p>
      <p>“I kind of, like, expected to come to the rink today and have him here, so. I’m kind of in shock still,” his teammate Zack Zeidel told the ABC News.</p>
