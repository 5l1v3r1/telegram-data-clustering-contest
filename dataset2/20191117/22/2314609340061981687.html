      <p>Australia A’s opening game at the Oceania Rugby Women’s Championships has been called off due to an outbreak of measles in Fiji.</p>
      <p>The match between the Australians and Tonga, which was due to take place on Monday, will be declared a draw with both teams awarded two points.</p>
      <p>Oceania Rugby made the decision to cancel the match after a member of the Tonga team was reported to the Fiji Ministry of Health &amp; Medical Services and Oceania Rugby to have suspected symptoms of measles.</p>

      <p>Australia A, who are coached by Moana Virtue, are still scheduled to face Samoa and a Black Ferns development side over the next week in Lautoka. With the Wallaroos already qualified for the 2021 World Cup, the Oceania championship is being used to build depth in their squad.</p>
      <p>The Australia A squad contains several players who turned out in Tests against Japan and New Zealand earlier this year, as well as rising stars on the cusp of Wallaroos selection.</p>
      <p>‘‘We want to be able to do the basics really, really well and give some of our Wallaroo fringes game time as well as breed in some new blood and give girls opportunities,’’ Virtue told rugby.com.au.</p>
