      <p>Reuters reports Sunday’s comments delivered by the UK Foreign Minister Raab while speaking in a BBC TV interview.</p>
      <p>When asked by if the UK could leave without a deal, Raab said: "No ... I don't think it's remotely likely."</p>
      <p>He explained that it's not "remotely likely" that the UK would leave the EU without agreeing on a free trade deal at the end of a post-Brexit transition period.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Meanwhile, with the UK opinion polls showing the Conservatives in the lead and following the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> Party leader Farage’s stepping from the 43 additional constituencies, where the Labour won, the GBP/USD pair saw a minor 9-pips bullish gap at the weekly opening.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">The Cable</a> then went on to hit fresh ten-day highs at 1.2928, currently trading near 1.2918 levels, still up +0.18%.</p>
