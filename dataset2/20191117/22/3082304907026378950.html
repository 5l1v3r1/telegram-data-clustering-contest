        <b>A dreadful pitch in Luxembourg was of more concern to Cristiano Ronaldo than his recent substitutions at Juventus.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo insists there was nothing controversial about his recent substitutions for Juventus because he has been playing through the pain of a knee complaint.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo appeared disgruntled when he was removed early in the second half of Juve’s Serie A match against AC Milan last weekend, with replacement Paulo Dybala going on to score the only goal in a 1-0 win.</p>
      <p>Head coach Maurizio Sarri explained afterwards that a bruised knee had hindered Ronaldo, who was also withdrawn during a preceding 2-1 Champions League triumph at Lokomotiv Moscow – another match where the five-time Ballon d’Or winner witnessed the winning goal from the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo retained his typically prolific form for Portugal during the international break, hitting a hat-trick in a 6-0 demolition of Lithuania before capping a 2-0 win in Luxembourg on Sunday that sealed qualification for Euro 2020 and moved him on to 99 goals for his country.</p>
      <p>“For the last three weeks, I have been playing limited. There was no controversy, you create controversy,” Ronaldo told reporters after the match at Stade Josy Barthel.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like to be replaced, but I have been playing limited for the last three weeks. I tried to help Juventus, even playing injured.</p>
      <p>“No one likes to be replaced, but I understand why – I was not well. I’m still not 100 per cent, but when it comes to sacrificing for the club or team I do it with pride because I know there were a lot of games up for grabs.”</p>

      <p>Ronaldo went on to outline the high stakes that persuade him to put his 34-year-old body on the line.</p>
      <p>“At Juventus, Inter are putting on a lot of pressure [in Serie A]. We are two points ahead, but we can’t go easy because if we draw or lose, they pass us and I sacrificed myself,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In the national team, if we didn’t win one of our two games, we could be out. I also sacrificed myself for the national team.</p>
      <p>“I never had major injuries. I play 50 or 60 games a year, but at one time or another there may be an unforeseen event – it’s a pain that keeps me from being 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>“I always try to help. They put a lot of controversy on this subject, but you know I don’t talk much in the press.</p>
      <p>“We won. Juventus are in first place, we qualified and I will be 100 per cent as fast as possible.”</p>
      <p>Portugal endured a tougher outing than expected in Luxembourg, with Ronaldo’s close-range strike sealing the points four minutes from time after a dismal playing surface served to compromise Fernando Santos’ side.</p>

      <p>“It is difficult to play on these pitches, a potato field,” Ronaldo added witheringly.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how it is possible for teams of this level to play on pitches of this quality. The game was not beautiful.</p>
      <p>“We did our job, it was the pitch where we had to play, we won 2-0 and that was the priority.”</p>
