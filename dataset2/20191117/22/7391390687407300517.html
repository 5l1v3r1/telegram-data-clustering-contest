      <p>Using heat is a super affordable and natural treatment for pain. When applied to aching areas (think: tight muscles or menstrual cramps), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3813871">it increases oxygen flow</a> and relaxes your muscles to aid in a speedy recovery. That's why having the <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-heating-pad/">best electric heating pads</a> on hand can make all the difference. But you'll want to make sure you're getting one that suits your needs and budget.</p>
      <p>There are two main types of electric heating pads you can use to quickly reduce pain and discomfort: Traditional heating pads and far infrared heating pads. Both of these options are believed to <a href="https://healthyspines.org/the-benefits-of-using-a-heating-pad/">ease muscle stiffness and promote healing</a>.</p>
      <p>Traditional electric heating pads are the most common and affordable. They often resemble blankets and have an insulated wire within the fabric casing that generates heat when turned on. You'll want the models that feature both dry and moist heat options for versatility and automatic timed shut-offs for safety. Traditional electric heating pads are a great choice for fast relief of cramps, back, shoulder, and leg pain.</p>
      <p>Far infrared heating pads on the other hand, typically work by using <a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/2009/6/Far-Infrared-Therapy/Page-01">infrared waves to warm natural stones</a> like jade to produce heat and negative ions to relax your muscles. They can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3699878/">penetrate an inch or so into the body</a> to provide a deeper warming effect. These are better suited for chronic pain and can cost significantly more than the traditional units.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the right relief for your symptoms, your best choice will depend on the kind of pain you're experiencing, whether it is cramps or neck pain. Below, the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-heating-pads-for-neck-shoulder-pain-12265196">best electric heating pads</a> on Amazon with the features you need for fast pain relief and the glowing reviews to back it up.</p>

      <p><b>Promising Review: </b>"This is the most amazing heating pad I have ever owned. It is very soft to the touch and not made out of stiff plastic like cheaper heating pads. It is large and with a long cord. This heating pad gets HOT. I am the type of person that could never have a heating pad get hot enough for me. This one does and I have to keep it around 4. You can start to feel heat in it within a minute. The heat is also uniform so it’s not like 1 hot spot near the plug when you turn it on. I would definitely buy this brand again and recommend. Don’t waste your time and money on other brands. Well worth the investment."</p>

      </p>
      <p>For more regular aches, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QQ60XO0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-17024571-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00QQ60XO0&amp;linkId=f68db3fd830d7b72fc1aca9ce92d45dd">UTK Far Infrared Natural Jade Heating Pad</a> is a great pick. Far infrared waves provide <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1412302">scientifically proven</a>, deep penetrating abilities, and the 126 natural jade stones found here provide precise heating plus negative ions to aid in relief. You can treat almost any part of the body with this pad by rolling, folding, or laying it flat.</p>

A memory function makes finding the right settings to hit that sweet spot of relaxation a breeze.

      <p><b>Promising Review:</b> "This product is so much better than a normal heating pad for so so many reasons. The controls allow temperature adjustment and time on/off adjustment - then you can set them in Memory for use later. The size is larger than a heating pad so I get better coverage. I use it every day for one reason or another. I have two of them now (different stones), and have them on my bed, with a light blanket over them to protect the surface and give a buffer between me and the pad. I turn it on before I get into bed, and when I get into bed it is amazing beyond delicious. Winter time will be even better!!! When I am working on a specific area - I put it on top of me too. The products are great and I have already given one as a gift for my sister who has problems and pain in her knees and legs -- she loves it too. She named it Fred and lets nobody borrow it -ever!"</p>
