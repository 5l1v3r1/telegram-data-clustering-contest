      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson will admit that British businesses didn’t want Brexit as he pleads for their support in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>The shameless Tory leader will claim only his party can deliver ‘certainty’ - despite the Conservatives having rammed through two referendums, three General Elections and three Prime Ministers in less than five years.</p>
      <p>He’s set to give a speech to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) - an industry body representing thousands of firms, which campaigned heavily against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>But Johnson is set to announce a raft of business tax cuts as a sweetener to help them ‘make the most’ of the Brexit they didn’t want.</p>
      <p>The cuts will include reductions to business rates and National Insurance contributions.</p>
      <p>He’ll make the announcement at the CBI’s annual conference in London on Monday.</p>

      <p>“Let’s not beat around the bush, big business didn’t want Brexit,” Mr Johnson is expected to say.</p>
      <p>“You made that clear in 2016 and this body said it louder than any other.“</p>
      <p> “But what is also clear is that what you want now - and have wanted for some time - is certainty.</p>
      <p> “So that you can plan and invest, so you can grow and expand, so that you can create jobs and drive prosperity.</p>
      <p> “Whilst you didn’t want it, the people did vote for it. And so it was for politicians to deliver it.”</p>

      <p>He will go on to blame Parliament for his party’s inability to secure a Brexit deal - accusing MPs of “actively tried to sabotage the democratic will of the people”.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader will also promise to increase tax relief for firms who buy, lease or construct buildings.</p>
      <p>And he’ll promise to increase the rate of tax credits for research and development by 1%.</p>
      <p>Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director general commented on Mr Johnson's refusal to extend the transition period - despite having failed to deliver on his October 31 deadline for Brexit.</p>
      <p>She said: "One of the things I think is really important to understand is that if you are in business, living through the last three years, these rolling cliff-edges of climbing up a mountain with stockpiling and then climbing down again, could not be more damaging."</p>
      <p>She added: "Let's make sure that we don't end up with yet another cliff-edge, possibly in June, or possibly at the end of December.</p>
      <p>"Because every time we do that we take investment away from our country."</p>
