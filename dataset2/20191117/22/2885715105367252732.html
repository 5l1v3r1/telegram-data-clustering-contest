      <p>A 19-year-old engineering student died in an accident after his motorcycle skidded while crossing the Katraj tunnel. The pillion rider, Rutwik Satishkumar Ranjan (19), also sustained fractures and has been admitted to a private hospital.</p>
      <p>Police have registered a case against the deceased student, Vaibhavraj Bibinkumar, on charges of rash driving, causing grievous hurt and endangering life. Neither student was wearing a helmet when the accident took place, said police.</p>
      <p>Both Vaibhavraj and Rutwik are first year students at the Sinhagad College of Engineering, said Assistant Police Inspector M S Deshmukh.</p>
      <p>“They stay at an apartment in Narhe outside the college campus. On Friday evening, they had gone over to the other side of Katraj tunnel in the evening and were returning to their apartment on the motorcycle when the vehicle skidded and rammed into the divider.</p>
      <p>Rutwik got thrown off the bike and managed to escape with fewer injuries. The vehicle was mangled and Vaibhavraj sustained severe injuries to his head, hands and chest. He died on the spot,” said Deshmukh.</p>
