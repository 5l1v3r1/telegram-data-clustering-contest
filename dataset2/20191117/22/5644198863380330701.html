      <p>VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis hosted 1,500 homeless and needy people for lunch on Sunday (Nov 17) as the Roman Catholic Church marked its World Day of the Poor.</p>
      <p>The menu for all in the Vatican's large audience hall, including the pope, was lasagne, chicken in cream of mushroom sauce, potatoes, sweets, fruit, and coffee.</p>

      <p>The pope's guests were brought to the Vatican by volunteers of charity groups who help them daily.</p>
      <p>All last week, a mobile clinic was set up in St Peter's Square where volunteer doctors have been giving the poor free specialist health care. </p>
      <p>General care is available year-round nearby, another of Francis' initiatives.</p>
      <p>Earlier, at a Mass for Rome's needy in St Peter's Square, Francis said those better off should not feel "annoyed" by the poor but help them as much as possible.</p>
      <p>He said they should ask themselves: "Do I, a Christian, have at least one poor person as a friend?"</p>
      <p>Francis established the yearly worldwide Catholic observance of the day in 2016.</p>
