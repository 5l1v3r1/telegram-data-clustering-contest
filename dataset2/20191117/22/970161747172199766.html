      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rochelle-humes/">Rochelle Humes</a> took an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction in her stride as she was forced to change outfits midway through <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sunday-brunch/">Sunday Brunch</a> after breaking her jeans.</p>
      <p>We plan on doing this every day over Christmas, but somehow we imagine that wasn’t quite Rochelle’s plan.</p>
      <p>The former member of The Saturdays appeared on the Channel 4 morning show to promote The Hit List, which she presents alongside husband and (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/jls-set-shock-reunion-chart-comeback-six-years-following-oritse-williams-rape-case-11148362/">soon to be reformed</a>) JLS band member <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marvin-humes/">Marvin Humes</a>.</p>
      <p>First seen wearing a white t shirt and oversized dark blue denim jacket, viewers were a little confused to see the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> presenter reappear after the break in a totally different ensemble.</p>
      <p>Sporting a brown long sleeved top and black jeans, Rochelle’s outfit change didn’t go unnoticed by presenter Simon Rimmer, who asked the singer to crack an egg only to realise that the top’s design meant that she had fabric covering her hands.</p>

      <p>Fashion, eh?</p>
      <p>‘This isn’t very good for cooking, is it,’ Rochelle said as the camera crew laughed out of shot, adding: ‘I’m all trapped.’</p>
      <p>‘Poor wardrobe choice,’ the TV chef chastised her, with Rochelle replying: ‘Well, you might’ve noticed I’ve got changed.</p>
      <p>‘I had denim on and I just breathed out a bit much and popped my zip and quickly got changed in the ad break.’</p>

      <p>You’ve got to admire her honesty!</p>
      <p>If there’s one thing we love Rochelle for, it’s her ability to keep it real about life as a normal mum-of-two.</p>
      <p>Recently, the singer opened up about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/13/rochelle-humes-opens-struggles-working-mum-expect-women-work-like-dont-children-10738120/">the pressures of being a working mum</a>, sharing a quote to her Instagram which read: ‘We expect women to work like they don’t have children and raise children as if they didn’t work.’</p>

      <p>‘This really spoke to me,’ Rochelle captioned the post. ‘I wonder why we still put so much pressure on Mums, and why does it always seem to be women that judge one another?’</p>
      <p>Speaking to her fellow parents, she continued: ‘If you’re a parent reading this and you’re doing all you can to make it work, I think you’re fabulous. After all being a Mum/Dad/parent/carer is the toughest gig in the world, we ALL parent differently and we ALL have Mum guilt.</p>

      <p>‘Let’s give ourselves a little more love.’</p>
      <p>Wise words indeed.</p>
