      <p>CNN's Shimon Prokupecz tweeted Sunday morning, "If you’re wondering what Trump was doing last night, and I know you are: President Trump had people over for a viewing of 'The Joker' movie Saturday night, a White House official tells CNN." A senior White House official confirmed to <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-hosts-white-house-screening-of-joker-162846043.html">Yahoo News</a> the accuracy of Prokupecz's report on the president's cinematic choice this weekend. "The senior White House official said Trump liked the film," according to Yahoo.</p>

      <p>Since its Oct. 4 domestic release, <i>Joker</i> has become the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever, having passed the worldwide <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/15/box-office-joker-tops-1-billion/#199ab06149dc">$1 billion</a> mark Friday. The dark and brutally violent film depicts the descent into madness of alienated loner Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin Phoenix, as he assumes the role of the iconic Batman villain.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joker-director-bemoans-outrage-from-far-left-amid-film-criticism">Some worried</a> the movie would trigger a violent response from disaffected young men, similar to the perpetrator of the 2012 mass shooting that occurred during a screening of <i>The Dark Knight</i> in Aurora, Colorado. A <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/aurora-shooting-victims-voice-concerns-over-joker-movie-letter-warner-n1058141">letter signed by families of victims</a> killed during the massacre condemned the violent content of <i>Joker</i> and asked the film's studio Warner Bros. to donate to causes aimed at ending gun violence. "We are calling on you to be a part of the growing chorus of corporate leaders who understand that they have a social responsibility to keep us all safe," they wrote.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> director Todd Phillips, 48, who became famous directing "bro" comedies such as <i>The Hangover</i>, lamented that escape from the demands of "woke culture" has become impossible.</p>

      <p>"Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture," he told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/joaquin-phoenix-cover-story"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a> in October. "There were articles written about why comedies don’t work anymore — I’ll tell you why, because all the f---ing funny guys are like, ‘F--- this shit, because I don’t want to offend you.’” Reflecting on the fact that his drama was met with similar outrage, Phillips said, "What's outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It's been really eye-opening for me."</p>
