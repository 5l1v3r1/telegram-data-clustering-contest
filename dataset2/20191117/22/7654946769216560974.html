      <p>A creepy police clerk has been jailed for six years for filming dozens of his colleagues using his California police department’s bathroom, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Sergio Nieto, 29, allegedly used his phone to film cops and other employees over at least three months as they used the facilities at a Long Beach Police Department bathroom, <a href="https://lbpost.com/news/crime/film-police-bathroom-spy-invastion-of-privacy-sergio-nieto">according to the Long Beach Post</a>.</p>
      <p>The records clerk made at least 115 secretly recorded videos of 69 of his coworkers — including high-ranking officers — filming them either getting changed or using the facilities, the paper said.</p>
      <p>He also admitted to filming people in the bathroom of a 24 Hour Fitness, the paper said, citing an arrest warrant.</p>
      <p>Nieto was busted after a detective <a href="https://lbpost.com/news/crime/police-bathroom-film-downey-gym">noticed a cell phone</a> pointed at him under the partition of his bathroom stall — easily identifying him thanks to his distinctive dress shoes, according to the documents.</p>
      <p>“This case was disturbing on many levels, but it is the complete betrayal of trust that many people cannot fathom,” Long Beach City Prosecutor Doug Haubert said in a statement. “This is the most serious case of invasion of privacy I have seen in my 20 years as a prosecutor.”</p>
      <p>Nieto pleaded no contest to 69 counts of misdemeanor invasion of privacy and was sentenced Friday to six years in prison, the Long Beach Post said.</p>
      <p>Once out, he will then be on probation for five years — facing more than 28 years behind bars if he commits another crime, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“Any slip-up and that’s probably what you’re going to get, and it won’t bother me in the least to give it to you,” Judge Christopher Frisco told him during sentencing, the paper said.</p>
      <p>Nieto will not be required to register as a sex offender unless he violates his probation, the paper noted.</p>
