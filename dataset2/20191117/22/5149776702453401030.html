      <h1>Harry Gurney - the anti-cricket poster boy on why he is sure The Hundred is the one</h1>
      <h2>The Nottinghamshire seamer has become the personification of what is wrong with English cricket for some, but he will not be swayed in his backing of The Hundred</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:50:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Davies</a></address>
      <p>A recent article Wisden portrayed Harry Gurney as the tournament director of new format <a href="https://www.wisden.com/stories/magazine/new-schemes-and-dystopian-dreams-jonathan-liew">'The One'.</a></p>
      <p>Set in cricket's Dystopian world of 2029 - or Utopian in Gurney's eye in this case- the tournament sees just one batter try to hit the ball furthest off the team's sole bowler in the aim of reviving the sport's fortunes.</p>
      <p>It is perhaps no surprise Gurney was the butt of the satirical joke. He has become the poster boy, or perhaps voodoo doll would be more apt, for those who oppose The Hundred, which like it or not, and plenty don't, is coming next summer.</p>
      <p>Gurney was spared the nerves of the draft having been chosen as a local icon by Trent Rockets, but of those players who made the cut, not one spoke in even the slightest negative tone about the tournament. Why would they?</p>
      <p>The difference is, Gurney is happy to stick his head up in cricket's trench warfare between traditionalists, which now includes Twenty 20 fans it seems, and those who want to usher in the brave new world.</p>
      <p>Even the tournament's most ardent defender recognises it has issues. The domestic schedule meand the Royal London One Day Cup is now the equivalent football's old Central League, the place where young players tried to prove themselves in the reserves against hardened pros who couldn't get a game in the big league.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/cricket">Nottinghamshire</a> seamer is adamant The Hundred will be a huge success with the world's best outside of India ready to board two flights - one in, one out - to play in England.</p>
      <p>"It's inevitable that it will have an impact on 50 over cricket. I'd be deluded to say it won't," Gurney said after living out of a suitcase last winter playing the Big Bash, Pakistan Super League and T10 League before his first IPL stint in the spring.</p>
      <p>"I'm really pleased the competition is coming. It's massively overdue.</p>
      <p>"I believe it will go in behind the IPL as the second best tournament in the world of this kind of format.</p>
      <p>"What puts the real top players off from going to play in tournaments is the length of the tournament.</p>

      <p>"The Hundred is a one month middle of July to middle of August competition.</p>
      <p>"It's the height of the English summer. There's no internal flights, just team buses and the hotels are good.</p>
      <p>"Quite a lot of these competitions around the world involve a lot of time airports. You don't have that here.</p>
      <p>"It will appeal to the best players. The money is good so you'll have to top players on show and because of the huge TV deal there's a good marketing budget.</p>
      <p>"I think it will be a huge success. Do I think it's perfect? Is it exactly how I would have done it in an ideal world? Probably not.</p>
      <p>"I don't think anything works out like that."</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old left armer will be part of the Nottingham based team which features county teammates Alex Hales, Steven Mullaney, Tom Moores, Matt Carter and Luke Fletcher.</p>
      <p>Joe Clarke, Ben Duckett and Dan Christian earned deals elsewhere but there was disappointment for Jake Ball and Samit Patel and the rest of the squad.</p>
      <p>Further afield, the likes of Northamptonshire's Josh Cobb and Somerset's Jamie Overton were among talented players overlooked.</p>
      <p>Gurney, who will be back in the IPL next year with Kolkata Knight Riders, recognises the three hour draft on Sky Sports was cut throat as players missed out on contracts ranging from £30,000 to £125,000, but he insists that is unavoidable.</p>
      <p>"It's another layer beyond international selection," he said.</p>
      <p>"That's professional sport. There are many other outstanding cricketers without contracts.</p>
      <p>"These drafts can be unpredicatble. There are some who can count themselves unlucky like Jake Ball, but at the end of the day nothing in life is 100 percent fair.</p>
      <p>"You have to pick yourself up and go again. That's what we do in sport.</p>
      <p>"Perseverance helps get you to the top."</p>
      <p>Trent Rockets have a firm base for success with Notts Outlaws averaging comfortably over 10,000 fans per home game in the Vitality Blast.</p>
      <p>Gurney expects similar crowds for The Hundred at Trent Bridge, while the London teams should flourish, but he sees stumbling blocks for some of the other five teams based in Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Southampton and Cardiff, with the latter two cities perhaps the most likely to struggle to sell tickets.</p>
      <p>"You'd have to ask the commercial people about expectations. Personally I think there will be similar crowds to the Blast from ball one in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>"The marketing is in full swing now and the budget is there. It's a big deal with people like Rashid Khan and Steve Smith coming.</p>
      <p>"Trent Bridge will be pretty full. I don't expect that will be the case everywhere in the country.</p>
      <p>"There will some challenges outside of London but overall it will be successful I think."</p>
