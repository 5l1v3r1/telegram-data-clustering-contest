      <p>Regional councils are set to benefit from the first round of the NSW government's $500-million Fixing Local Roads program.</p>
      <p>NSW Liberal Upper House MP for the Hunter, Taylor Martin, is encouraging Lake Macquarie City Council to nominate shovel-ready projects they'd like to get off the ground.</p>
      <p>"The first round of Fixing Local Roads is now open and will help councils with projects that are shovel-ready to get started, ensuring local communities are benefiting sooner," Mr Martin said.</p>
      <p>The investment would help keep communities connected and would boost economic and social development, he said.</p>
      <p>"More than 80 per cent of our state's road network is managed by councils."</p>
      <p>Mr Martin said by helping councils to clear their maintenance backlogs, the state government helped to create more job opportunities and delivered safe and reliable access to critical services such as hospitals and schools.</p>
      <p>Applications close on December 2.</p>
