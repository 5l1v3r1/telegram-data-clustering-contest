      <p>Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja</p>
      <p>The diversity in Nigeria is better managed with a federal system of government, the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has said.</p>
      <p>Fashola, who disclosed this at the 2019 Island Club 76th Anniversary Lecture, urged the present generation of young Nigerians to look before they leap, particularly as regards calls for restructuring.</p>
      <p>The minister’s address at the anniversary was made available to our correspondent by the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Abuja on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He stated that proponents of restructuring had not been specific, adding that it appeared that some of them simply want what they were used to in their more youthful days, which was a parliamentary system of government and not a presidential.</p>
      <p>“However, a much younger generation did not experience the parliamentary system and may be taken in by some arguments such as the cost of getting elected and the cost of legislative work,” Fashola said.</p>
      <p>He added, “True as the cost of legislation may be as a factor, this generation must be told in clear terms that it was during the parliamentary system that the political crisis of the 1960s started, and with a combination of other factors, led to a civil war in which many died.</p>
      <p>“They must read up about it, and demand more explanation as to why it did not prevent our division from resulting in a full-blown civil war.”</p>
      <p>He explained that the United Kingdom parliamentary system had produced four prime ministers in the last 12 years, including the incumbent.</p>
      <p>The minister asked if Nigerians really wanted such rapid political leadership changes and what it portends for policy consistency and continuity.</p>
      <p>He said, “All I can add is that empirical evidence has shown that diversity such as we have, is better managed with a federal arrangement and that this generation should look before they leap.”</p>
