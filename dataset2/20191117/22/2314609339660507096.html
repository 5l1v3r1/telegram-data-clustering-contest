      <p>The hosts, who twice led through Dusan Tadic and Alekasander Mitrovic, had to win to have a chance of qualifying automatically. Serbia will now travel to Oslo in March for a play-off semi-final against Norway.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo poked home from close range to confirm Portugal’s victory and move to within one of a century of international goals. Only Iranian great Ali Daei, with 109, has reached such a milestone.</p>
      <p>‘‘We have proved that we are one of the greatest teams in Europe and the world,’’ Portugal coach Fernando Santos said.</p>
      <p>‘‘You have to believe in these players. We have to remain grounded and we will be there as [title] candidates.’’</p>
      <p>England had already qualified but the victory in Pristina ensures they will be among the top six seeds in next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Harry Winks scored his first international goal to give Gareth Southgate’s side a half-time lead. Harry Kane made it two and late goals followed from substitutes Marcus Rashford and Mason Mount, his first for England.</p>

      <p>‘‘It was a tight game and a good test for us,’’ Southgate said.</p>
      <p>‘‘It was a difficult pitch, with players slipping and passes going astray. We needed a tighter game and a challenge. I’m happy we got that.</p>
      <p>‘‘We had to sustain spells of pressure and gave them chances - on another night that would be a problem. But attacking, we were ruthless.’’</p>
