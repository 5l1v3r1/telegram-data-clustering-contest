        <b>STEVE CLARKE isn’t gunning for revenge over Kazakhstan this week — just three points.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> were humiliated 3-0 in Astana back in March, a result that led to Alex McLeish’s sacking.</p>

      <p>But Clarke — who has called up <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14919/kilmarnock/">Kilmarnock’s</a> Eamonn Brophy to replace injured Lawrence Shankland — is only interested in a third consecutive victory before the Euro 2020 play-off next March.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m not one for revenge. It’s an important game because we want to finish third.</p>
      <p>"We also want to go into the play-off game on the back of three wins in a row and it’s a chance to do that.</p>
      <p>“We want that feel-good factor and slowly it’s starting to come back.</p>

      <p>“The fans will have gone home from Cyprus pleased after a 2-1 win.</p>
      <p>“It will be nice to see a few of them back at Hampden on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“In the last few games I’ve made four or five changes. Right now I’m not envisaging I’ll make that many this time.”</p>
      <p>Kenny McLean was injured for the Cyprus match but could come back into contention.</p>
      <p>Clarke added: “He picked up a knock with his club but we didn’t pull him out the squad as we had enough withdrawals.</p>
      <p>“Kenny has an outside chance of being available. We’ll assess what we have injury-wise and if we feel we need to pull Kenny back in we can do that.”</p>
