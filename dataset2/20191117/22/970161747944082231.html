      <p>Viewers were absolutely loving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> rejoining <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> as host of the new series of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/im-celebrity-2019-line-start-11070107/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… but they’re already missing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a>.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old This Morning host replaced Ant for 2018’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celeb</a>, but he took back the reins this year.</p>
      <p>Fans were happy Ant was back by Dec’s side in the jungle, but social media was divided as Holly proved to be popular the year before.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote on Twitter: ‘So happy to see @antanddec back together again for @imacelebrity but I do miss @hollywills.’</p>
      <p>And another tweeted: ‘I miss Holly Willoughby already, not gonna lie.’</p>
      <p>While one mother wrote: ‘My little boy has just said the jungle is strange without Holly, he loved you last year.’</p>
      <p>Not even one ad break in, however, and people began rushing to Ant’s defence.</p>

      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘So glad Ant is reunited with Dec on I’m A Celebrity there (sic) a great pair together. [I] mean @hollywills done a great job last year but it’s always great when them two are together.’</p>

      <p>While one viewer joked: ‘Holly had a haircut? She looks different…’</p>
      <p>One viewer tweeted: ‘As much as I’m gonna miss having @hollywills on TV every night for the next 3 weeks it’s good to have the pair back in the jungle, it ain’t the same without @antanddec in the jungle together.’</p>
      <p>Then the memes began…</p>

      <p>But who’s going to be the first one to go?</p>
