      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Whether you are rocking an Android or an iPhone, your favorite Disney movies and TV shows can be right at your fingertips with the Disney+ app. You can also use the Android and iOS apps to cast videos to your TVs using Google Chromecast or Apple AirPlay.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disney on the go: <a href="https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU56920YYw%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=NQwNrb1q">Disney+</a> ($7/month at Disney+)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Watch Disney+ wherever you are</h4>
      <p>Disney+ offers hundreds of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-movies-does-disney-plus-have">movies</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-tv-shows-does-disney-plus-have">television shows</a> for you to feast your eyes on. This means that you'll probably end up watching even when you aren't at home.</p>
      <p>This is an easy task since the streaming service has apps out for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-basically-will-support-all-devices-launch">a variety of devices</a> — almost all of them. You can stream from your phone, Android TV, and even Chromecast. This means that keeping your kids happy during long car rides and plane trips will now be easier than ever, since they'll have access to so much content.</p>
      <p>You can even turn your old phone into a dedicated Disney+ device for your kids to watch on the go. While the Disney+ app doesn't support every mobile phone ever made, the platform requirements for Android and iOS are pretty lenient:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disney+ is supported on Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and later.</li>
        <li>Disney+ is supported on iOS 11.0 and later.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>iOS 11 debuted in 2017 and Android Lollipop debuted in 2014, so all current phones — and really, most phones sold in the last 4 years — are compatible with Disney+, which is great news for your kids who can use it on hand-me-down phones from their parents.</p>
      <h4>Download for offline marathons!</h4>
      <p>You may not want to watch Disney+ on such a small screen all the time, but there is one area where the Android and iOS apps get an edge over streaming on laptops and smart TVs: offline playback. You can download videos onto your phone so that when the Wi-Fi goes down and the mobile network is overloaded, you still have your favorite episodes to tide you over while you're trapped without Internet.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can download content in one of three quality levels, but unless you have an Android phone with a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">nice, big microSD card</a>, I recommend sticking to Standard or Medium instead of High. One nice addition to the Download quality menu is that the app will tell you how much video you could download at each quality level, which is especially helpful on phones with less storage and no microSD expansion option, like my 64 GB <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Unlocked-Clearly/dp/B07R5CBGY4?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU56920YYw">Pixel 3a</a>.</p>
