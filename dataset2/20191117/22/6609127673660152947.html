        <b>A MUM of six yesterday told how she was sent a threat to petrol bomb her family home as her lad of two fought cancer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sarahjane Galbraith, 30, was left “petrified” after receiving chilling hate mail warning her to abandon a cash drive to help seriously-ill son Lachlan Stewart.</p>

      <p>The culprit told her they would torch her house with all of her kids inside — including Lachlan who needed an emergency op to remove a football-sized tumour on his kidney.</p>
      <p>Sarahjane, of Lossiemouth, Moray, said: “What kind of person targets a little boy who has cancer?</p>
      <p>“The letters said our movements were being watched and petrol bombs were coming to the house. They made me feel scared to be in my home.</p>

      <p>“They accused us of using Lachlan’s illness as a way of making money, which is not true.”</p>
      <p>Sarahjane had just given birth to youngest child Billie-Jo when pals rallied round and started a campaign which raised £5,000 for stricken Lachlan and his loved ones.</p>
      <p>But a mystery critic was so outraged by the community effort they started sending the family vile letters.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The first arrived weeks after Lachlan underwent a nine-hour op at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow on the stage four neuroblastoma.</p>
      <p>Another labelled “final warning” read: “Making money from a seek bairn. Hold head in shame. This stops or boys cum burn vans and house.”</p>
      <p>Alarmed Sarahjane and partner Jimmy Stewart, 43, called in cops who launched a probe.</p>
      <p>Officers put their home under watch in a bid to catch the sender.</p>
      <p>Police arrested a woman, 37, but are still investigating the notes.</p>
      <p>Sarahjane said: “A friend started the fundraising so we could try and put a smile on Lachlan’s face when his treatment finished.</p>
      <p>"Were they jealous? Is that why they tried to scare us when my boy had cancer and my baby girl was days old? It’s horrible.”</p>
      <p>Lachlan’s treatment finished earlier this month and he got to ring a special bell at the Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital to mark the occasion.</p>
      <p>He’d been stuck in wards since May last year so his parents are planning a bumper Christmas for him and siblings, Alistair, 11, Alisha, 10, Archie, 6, Sarahjane, 5, and little Billie-Jo.</p>
      <p>Sarahjane is also planning to throw Lachlan a third birthday party and hopes to use the fundraising cash to take him on a trip to Blackpool.</p>
      <p>She added: “The money is all for Lachlan and we haven’t touched a penny of it. When he rang that bell a weight lifted off my shoulders.</p>
      <p>“This is going to be his first chance to properly celebrate his birthday.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got superheroes coming and a bouncy castle. It will be a big day.”</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed tonight: “A 37-year-old woman has been arrested and further enquiries are ongoing.”</p>
