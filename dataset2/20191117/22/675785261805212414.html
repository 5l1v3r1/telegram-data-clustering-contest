      <h2>Sonny Bill Williams claimed he quickly got over New Zealand's World Cup exit - and Stuart Hogg says he would be annoyed if any of his Scotland team-mates had that attitude</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Stuart Hogg has hit out at Sonny Bill Williams for comments made after signing for Toronto Wolfpack - and claimed he would be furious if any of his Scotland team-mates had the same attitude.</p>
      <p>Speaking for the first time since his dramatic move to the Super League outfit last week, Williams claimed he got over New Zealand's Rugby World Cup semi-final defeat to England in "five to 10 minutes".</p>
      <p>Hogg is all too familiar with World Cup disappointment following Scotland's shock exit at the group stage after being beaten by hosts Japan.</p>
      <p>And the he believes Williams' frank admission show he never cared enough.</p>
      <p>Asked if he would be annoyed if one of his Scotland team-mate made a similar admission after their defeat to Japan, Hogg said: “I’d be very annoyed, yes, very annoyed.</p>

      <p>"If you’re in that situation you don’t care enough, and you’ve got to care. You’ve got to care about your own performance, you’ve got to care about your teams’ performance and you’ve got to care about the environment you’re in.</p>
      <p>“I think that ultimately will come out in your performance. If you’re not caring then, ultimately, what’s the point in being there?”</p>
      <p>Williams has become the highest paid player in the history of rugby across either code, whilst Hogg has also embarked on a new challenge by linking up with Premiership side Exeter.</p>

      <p>Yet whilst he is a big admirer of Williams' work on the field, he has questioned the motives behind his latest switch between codes.</p>
      <p>The full-back commented: “I love his work. I love everything he’s done, but I’ve always found that he’s always in the biggest competitions possible.</p>
      <p>“You look at him and he’s gone to the Rugby World Cup, then went to a Rugby League World Cup, then went to another Rugby World Cup, then did boxing, tried to go to the Olympics, this that and the other. All these massive events, he wants to be involved in.</p>

      <p>“Everybody is different, but from my experience of the World Cup, obviously we went out at different stages, but the best thing for me was coming straight to a new club where I could switch off from it.</p>
      <p>“It was only a couple of weeks ago when we had the homecoming at Exeter Chiefs that we really talked about the World Cup for the first time again.</p>
      <p>“I think if I’d had a couple of weeks off I’d have been really disappointed with the way things had gone.</p>
      <p>“That’s not to say I’m not, but I just jumped into a new challenge which kind of took my mind away from it.</p>

      <p>“For me, I think Sonny Bill’s mind is off it for other reasons and I think he’s pretty happy with what’s going to be in his bank account by the sounds of it.</p>
      <p>“Everybody is different, but you always want to challenge yourself, always want to get the best out of yourself.</p>
      <p>“He’s challenged himself in different environments, different sports, and he seems to succeed in them all so fair play to him.</p>
      <p>“He’s a big, handsome bugger as well so he’s got it all, hasn’t he?!" Hogg joked.</p>
