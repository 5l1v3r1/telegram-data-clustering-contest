      <p>A New Jersey man, 18, was arrested and held without bond for allegedly ordering the vandalism of two synagogues in other states.</p>
      <p>Richard Tobin is accused of using a neo-Nazi social network called The Base to find volunteers to for the September graffiti attacks on synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Tobin also allegedly said he planned the attacks as part of nationwide campaign he called “Operation Kristallnacht,” a reference to the 1938 pogrom against Jewish homes, synagogues and Jewish owned-owned businesses in Germany and Austria.</p>
      <p>Tobin also confessed to driving to a New Jersey mall with a machete that he planned to use to kill black shoppers.</p>
      <p>A complaint filed Tuesday by the FBI charges Tobin with conspiring with a hate group against the rights of minorities, including Jews, NJ.com reported.</p>
      <p>The group calls itself a “white protection league” and advocates for a country populated only by white people. Its members practice “doomsday prepping,” or preparing for the end of the world, and participate in military training. The group’s symbol references a failed 1923 German coup led by Adolf Hitler, according to the FBI.</p>
      <p>The court filings have not named the people who attacked the two synagogues.</p>
      <p>Tobin appeared in federal court in Camden, New Jersey on Friday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen M. Williams ordered Tobin held pending a mental health evaluation and scheduled a detention hearing scheduled for next month.</p>
