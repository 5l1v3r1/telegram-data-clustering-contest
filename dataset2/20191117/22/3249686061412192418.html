      <p><b>TWICE</b> just concluded their 2-day concert at Miyagi, Japan last night, November 17, as part of <b>TWICELAND World Tour 2019</b>. </p>
      <p>After the event, members <b>Momo</b> and <b>Dahyun</b> went live via V App while on the way to their hotel but viewers got confused because just 5 minutes into their broadcast, the girls said their goodbyes abruptly.</p>
      <p>When fans replayed the video, it was later found out that someone was following their vehicle.</p>

      <p>Someone inside the car whispered <i>"they followed us"</i> so Momo and Dahyun quipped that they had to turn the lights inside their car off and just stop their broadcast. Before the video ended, Momo said <i>"please stop following us"</i>.</p>
      <p>Last week, TWICE also shed light on their concern about being followed on their dorm and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/twice-talks-about-protecting-their-dorm-politely-asks-fans-to-respect-their-privacy">politely asked fans to help them protect their living space</a>. ONCEs were also alarmed by a foreign fan who's actively stalking Nayeon and have continuously reported it to <b>JYP Entertainment</b>. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, TWICE will be staying in Japan to promote their upcoming album <b>Fake &amp; True</b> which is set to be released on the 20th of November.</p>
