      <p>The four-bedroom gaff in Glasgow’s southside was bought by car boss Malcolm, 55, in 2016 but he has never lived in it.</p>
      <p>Two new £100,000 Range Rovers with blacked out windows are regularly parked in the driveway.</p>
      <p>Jamieson, of Paisley — previously jailed for his part in a £9million drugs gang — has no known source of income.</p>
      <p>One local said: “They look like just a normal family. There are a lot of fancy cars in the area so theirs don’t particularly stand out.</p>
      <p>“They do have a lot of people coming and going though.</p>
      <p>“The police seem to drive through the area a lot on patrol.”</p>

      <p>The house, built in 2013, has French doors, two en suite bathrooms and a garage.</p>
      <p>Jamieson served half of his 8½-year sentence and was freed in 2013.</p>
      <p>He is best pals with feared crime boss Jamie ‘Iceman’ Stevenson, 54.</p>
      <p>Malcolm, nicknamed The Fat Controller, owns a string of properties including his £9million mansion near Gleneagles, Perthshire.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Malcolm <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/3181664/stevie-malcolm-taxi-tycoon-steps-down-edinburgh/">stepped down</a> as boss of one of his biggest firms, Edinburgh City Private Hire.</p>
