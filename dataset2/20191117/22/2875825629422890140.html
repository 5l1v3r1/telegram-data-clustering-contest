      <p>It's the end of an era for north Dubliners after the heartbreaking news that a popular shop will close its doors after a staggering 50 years of business.</p>
      <p>Rush Hardware, which is owned by the Smyth family, will close down in late December/early January after five decades of serving people in the area, <a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/dublin-shop-rush-hardware-closed-17271574">Dublin Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Ciaran Smyth took to Facebook to announce the news saying: "After 50+ years of business, in late December or early January Rush hardware will close its doors for the last time."</p>
      <p>He added: "John, Brenda and the Smyth family would like to thank everybody body for their custom over the years."</p>

      <p>Heartbroken locals were quick to comment on the closure with many paying tribute to the iconic shop and wishing the owners the best in their retirement.</p>
      <p>One person said: "Rush Hardware provided a great service to the town of Rush, especially when not everybody had a car, and had to shop local."Â </p>
      <p>A second added: "Best of luck to your mam and dad, Ciaran on their retirement that's an amazing achievement."</p>
      <p>A third commented: "I remember the kindness of Brenda and John, and nothing was ever a bother to them.</p>
      <p>"Always willing to help you out in anyway possible. Will be missed, but good health and happiness to you both on your retirement."</p>
      <p>Ciaran Smyth added that there was something in the works to replace the hardware shop but was unable to confirm what that would be.</p>
