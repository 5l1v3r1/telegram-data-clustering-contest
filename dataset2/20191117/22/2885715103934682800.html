      <h1>Maharashtra: Heavy rain, lack of green fodder in ‘flush period’ hit milk procurement in state dairies</h1>
      <h2>Green fodder had started becoming scarce from December last year in certain parts of the state, leading to lower milk production and delayed calving.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:39:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/parthasarathi-biswas/" target="_blank">Parthasarathi Biswas</a></address>
      <p>AS green fodder remains scarce in Maharashtra, dairy farmers are worried about a delayed start to the ‘flush period’, when animals start producing more milk. Delayed calving and non-availability of green fodder have delayed the onset of the ‘flush period’, they said.</p>
      <p>Usually, in the post-monsoon months, animals start producing more milk due to better availability of green fodder and water.</p>
      <p>This is called the ‘flush period’, while milk production dips in the ‘lean period’, which starts from April.</p>
      <p>Procurement price of milk dips during the flush period while dairies have to pay more during the lean period.</p>
      <p>But this year, while the flush season has started, dairies are grappling with milk shortage. Continuous rain, non-availability of green fodder and delayed calving have affected the flush season, said Rajiv Mitra, CEO of Prabhat Lactalis.</p>
      <p>Green fodder had started becoming scarce from December last year in certain parts of the state, leading to lower milk production and delayed calving. Unseasonal rain in the last two weeks of October also affected the production of fodder, especially the standing crops of maize and jowar.</p>
      <p>Ravindra Apte, chairman of the Kolhapur District Cooperative Milk Producers Union, known as the Gokul brand, said the collection of cow’s milk has dropped.</p>
      <p>“At present, we are reporting collection of 7 lakh litres of buffalo milk per day while that of cow milk is around 4.75 lakh litres,” he said.</p>
      <p>Last year, Gokul had reported a peak collection of 14.75 lakh litres per day during the flush period. The dip in collection in cow’s milk was also because of restrictions imposed by the Union, said Apte.</p>
      <p>The extended lean period has, however, led to better realisation for farmers. Dairies in Pune, Satara and Ahmednagar are paying Rs 27-28 per litre for milk.</p>
      <p>Dairies in Sangli and Kolhapur, however, are still paying their dairies Rs 25 per litre. Both Mitra and Apte said milk production was likely to increase in the next few weeks.</p>
