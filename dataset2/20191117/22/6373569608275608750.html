      <h2>Lauren Robertson, from Aberdeen University, has branded the likes of The Lady and the Tramp and Dumbo as "dodgy" and says they have "not aged well"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:29:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Eve</a></address>
      <p>A student who reviewed Disney films has rounded on the old classics claiming they were "dodgy" when watched in 2019 Britain.</p>
      <p>After new streaming network Disney+ included warnings on some of its classic movies, admitting that they 'may contain outdated cultural depictions', Lauren Robertson, a languages student at Aberdeen University took to online student new website <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2019/11/15/i-rewatched-10-disney-childhood-classics-and-yikes-theyre-dodgy-131771">The Tab</a> to offer up her reviews of children's classics such as Dumbo, Peter Pan, Fantasia and Pinocchio.</p>
      <p>With her tongue planted occasionally in her cheek, her reviews zeroed-in on parts of the films which, by today's more liberal and politically-correct standards, could be considered somewhat discriminatory, and on occasion, outright shocking.</p>
      <p>Addressing The Jungle Book, from 1967, Lauren said: “Remember King Louie the orangutan?</p>
      <p>"You probably didn't realise when you watched it age five with all your animal teddies lined up in front of the TV, but there is a hell of a lot of criticism about him being a racist caricature.</p>

        <figcaption>Perfect for it's time, but looking back, did Disney use discriminatory tropes?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"He and the other monkeys are shown to be foolish and criminal, and they literally sing about wanting to be able to make the white man's fire."</p>
      <p>She also warned viewers not to be "fooled by fond memories of two cute pups eating spaghetti" in Lady and the Tramp - something which is apparently "actually problematic in itself".</p>
      <p>Lauren said: "Repressed somewhere in your innocent little head you’ll also find the film’s Siamese cats.</p>
      <p>"Lady and the Tramp's 'Siamese Cat Song' is so blatantly racist that it has apparently been cut out of the film entirely in the remake.</p>
      <p>"Rewatching this was actually painful and completely cringeworthy.</p>
      <p>"Not only do the cats both look and sound identical, their characters are sneaky and quite frankly annoying."</p>

        <figcaption>Sunflower the centaur from the film Fantasia - so racist that it was cut from the film</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Lauren also noted how one clip in the film 1940 Fantasia was considered so racist that it was cut from the movie by 1959.</p>
      <p>She explained how the character 'Sunflower the centaur' was "basically a slave of the other centaurs and would throw a tantrum when they weren't properly groomed."</p>
      <p>She also reckons that Dumbo, which was released in 1941, is also racist.</p>
      <p>Lauren said: “The whole of the end scene of Dumbo literally relies on the crows as racist stereotypes.</p>
      <p>“The lead crow 'Jim Crow' was a term used to mock black men, so you don't have to look far to find where this movie goes INCREDIBLY wrong.</p>

        <figcaption>The crow scene in Dumbo was rumoured to reference the infamous Jim Crow Laws which enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States, Segregation was enforced for public pools, phone booths, hospitals, asylums, jails and residential homes for the elderly and disabled. In the early 1830s, the white actor Thomas Dartmouth “Daddy” Rice was propelled to stardom for performing minstrel routines as the fictional “Jim Crow,” a caricature of a clumsy, dimwitted black slave</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“In amongst its classic bops, Disney has many songs with pretty problematic lyrics.</p>
      <p>“In Dumbo's 'Song of the Roustabouts', faceless dark-skinned characters sing "When other folks have gone to bed / We slave until we’re almost dead.”</p>
      <p>Some of Lauren’s harshest criticism was reserved for the original version of Aladdin, about which she explains "everything" is "problematic".</p>
      <p>She said: “Here's another film that Disney have remade in order to cover up the blatantly problematic original.</p>
      <p>"Right smack bang in the middle of the opening song, Agrabah (Arab-land) is described to be 'barbaric, but hey, it's home.'</p>

        <figcaption>Woman has meaningful relationship with giant beast-man. Not a West Country true-crime story, but a romantic cartoon for kids</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Aladdin is a white fantasy with mispronounced Arabic words and has nonsense scribbles as writing. They also have American accents?</p>
      <p>"I totally thought Jasmine was badass when I was a kid but in reality she just bats her eyelids, gets stuck in a big sand-timer and cries into her tiger's fur."</p>
      <p>Other films that came under fire in Lauren's forensic film critique include Beauty and the Beast, for it's clear not towards 'bestiality', Cinderella is 'super anti-feminist' and 'a wet wipe'. Lauren also notes how King Triton was somewhat understandably concerned his 16-year-old daughter in The Little Mermaid wanted to run off with a man she'd only seen once.</p>

      <p>Lauren said: "It's not news to anyone that some of Disney's old classic movies are not the most politically correct or culturally appropriate.</p>
      <p>"Many of the films have not aged well, with characters portraying racist and exaggerated stereotypes.</p>
      <p>"It's a good shout from Disney to acknowledge that many of the films would not be so well received if they were released today, that is if they were allowed to be released at all, they're that dodgy.</p>
      <p>"I was pretty shocked to watch my childhood favourites back and realise just how horrendously offensive and outdated many of them are.</p>
      <p>"Honestly I'm glad I got over my dreams of being a Disney Princess, because that dodgy world is not one I want to live in."</p>

        <figcaption>Tom and Jerry cartoons have also come under the spotlight for inappropriate stereotypes</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There's no information whether Lauren will be looking at the use of violence or racism in Tom and Jerry cartoons. </p>
      <p>When Amazon Prime Instant Video began showing the cartoons in 2014 - some of which are more than 70-years-old they were accompanied by warnings that they may depict scenes of "racial prejudice".</p>
      <p>Amazon's warning said such prejudice was once "commonplace" in US society and they stated: "Tom and Jerry shorts may depict some ethnic and racial prejudices that were once commonplace in American society. Such depictions were wrong then and are wrong today."</p>
