      <h1>Luis Enrique's 2017 comments hint becoming next Arsenal manager is a big possibility</h1>
      <h2>The Barcelona legend has been out of a job since leaving his post as Spain manager to be with his daughter before she tragically passed away in August</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T22:00:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Former Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is reportedly one of the names being lined up to replace Unai Emery should <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> decide to sack the struggling Spaniard.</p>
      <p>And judging by his comments in 2017, a job in England could appeal to Luis Enrique, who admitted he would like to manage in the country 'at some point.'</p>
      <p>Emery is under huge pressure following a dreadful run of results for the Gunners which has seen them fail to record a victory in their last four Premier League games.</p>
      <p>They now lie eight points outside the Champions League qualification places, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-month-save-job-20895792">some reports have claimed time may be running out for Emery</a> unless he turns it around soon.</p>

      <p>Along with the likes of Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers, Luis Enrique has been one of the names touted as a possible replacement for Emery, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/luis-enrique-one-one-id-manage-england-some-point-fans-are-faithful?page=0%2C2">FourFourTwo</a> two years ago the 49-year-old said a role with an English side has always appealed to him.</p>
      <p>He was being linked with the Reading job at the time, but said: "I was cycling in South Africa when I got a call about Reading. It was gossip, I never spoke to them.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to manage in England at some point. My wife wouldn't like the weather, she's from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and likes the sun. It would depend on the team and the football they played."</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique won the treble with Barcelona in the 2014-2015 season, and in total won nine trophies in his three seasons as manager at the club.</p>

      <p>He later went on to become Spain manager, but stepped down when his daughter was diagnosed with bone cancer and tragically died in August.</p>
      <p>Emery's Arsenal have a big opportunity to get back to winning ways when they host struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
