      <p>Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly appeared to poke fun at the Duke of York’s Newsnight interview as I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! 2019 kicked off.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Andrew attempted to defend his reputation following the Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal, and denied claims he had underage sex with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers.</p>
      <p>Giuffre has said she recalled the royal sweating as they danced at a club, but he said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.</p>

      <p>As I’m A Celebrity got under way on ITV on Sunday, McPartlin said this year’s contestants were likely to be “sweating”.</p>
      <p>But Donnelly quipped: “Presuming they can sweat, not everybody can apparently…”</p>
      <p>The duo also made a couple of jibes about contestant Caitlyn Jenner possibly pocketing a huge salary for appearing on show.</p>
      <p>The US reality TV star – known for Keeping Up With The Kardashians – is said to be getting paid £500,000.</p>

      <p>Donnelly joked that most people go into the jungle to lose a few pounds, and McPartlin teased that Jenner was apparently “going to be gaining 500,000”.</p>
      <p>Donnelly then reminded McPartlin not to believe everything he reads.</p>
