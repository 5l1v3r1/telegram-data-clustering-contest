      <h1>Rafa Benitez destined for Premier League return - but Steve Bruce deserves credit</h1>
      <h2>The Spaniard's time in China has got off to a bad start and it surely won't be a long-term arrangement. Yet Newcastle are seven points better off under their new boss.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Coming soon to a Premier League club near you… <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rafael-benitez">Rafa ­Benitez</a> .</p>
      <p>You can bet your bottom dollar on it.</p>
      <p>The smoothie took to the BBC ­airwaves last week and reminded ­everyone that this is his spiritual home – never mind his family home, as it happens.</p>
      <p>For now, Benitez says he is happy in China and that Dalian Yifang – ­providers of his £12million-a-year wage (after tax) – are happy with him.</p>
      <p>Happy with him, despite a record of one win, one draw and five losses in his last seven matches.</p>
      <p>He is lucky. When it comes to ­managers, Chinese club owners make their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> equivalents look like an eternally patient bunch.</p>

      <p>Benitez is Dalian Yifang’s 18th coach in 10 years.</p>
      <p>After a bright start when he joined in July, the fortunes of Rafa’s mid-table team have tailed off quite dramatically.</p>
      <p>They have three Chinese Super League fixtures left, but little to play for.</p>
      <p>Benitez’s initial impact and career record ought to stand him in good stead.</p>
      <p>But, if there was a Premier League job coming up and a hefty ­pay-off compromise to be reached in China, it would not be the greatest surprise to see him back here.</p>

      <p>As long as Mike Ashley owns it, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> will not be an ­option, obviously.</p>
      <p>But anyway, while posts might come up at, say, West Ham, Arsenal or Southampton, the one at St James’ Park is unlikely to be vacated for some time.</p>
      <p>Benitez is right when he says comparing seasons is not ­always fair.</p>
      <p>And, although <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> has Newcastle a very welcome seven points better off than Rafa had them at this stage last season, let’s wait and see how it pans out over the whole piece.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>After all, while Bruce has had a tough fixture list so far, it was, arguably, a tougher start to the 2018/19 campaign for Benitez. But one thing looks certain – with each encouraging result, Bruce is looking a good fit for the job.</p>
      <p>Indeed, with each horrible result, he did not look a bad fit, talking with a blunt honesty that must go down well with the fan base.</p>
      <p>Attendances are down at St James’ Park, reflecting the irretrievable ­breakdown of the relationship – if any ever existed – between owner and the majority of supporters.</p>
      <p>But those who do turn up at least have the prospect of being lifted from their seats. Benitez has left a good ­defensive legacy and he recruited Miguel ­Almiron.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>With the mercurial Allan ­Saint-Maximin and Joelinton added, Newcastle look a decent ­counter-attacking force.</p>
      <p>If those three start scoring goals, they will be an even more decent force.</p>
      <p>Bruce does pretty much what it says on the tin.</p>
      <p>Kicks every ball, speaks plainly, is euphoric in victory, ­inconsolable in defeat.</p>
      <p>And, judging by the Toon’s recent ­performances, he is a better coach than he is given credit for.</p>
      <p>He is unlikely to ever be ­revered in the same way that Rafa was – and still is – on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>That probably will not change – even if Benitez were to pitch up at, say, the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>But he is making a good fist of a tough gig and a bit of local love would not go amiss.</p>
