      <h1>Wales fans mock Real Madrid with hilarious flag following Gareth Bale’s return from injury</h1>

        <b>On Saturday, a few Welsh fans were spotted with a hilarious flag mocking La Liga giants Real Madrid, during Saturday’s UEFA Euro 2020 qualifier game between Wales and Azerbaijan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The flag which read “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order,” was clearly a reference to Gareth Bale, who was recently slammed by former Real Madrid striker Pedja Mijatovic, who insisted he was concerned about the player’s priorities.</p>
      <p>In a column for the Spanish publication <i>AS</i>, Mijatovic had written: “The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid.”</p>
      <p>As you can see in the photo below, the Montenegro international’s words then made their way into the comical flag:</p>

      <p>Earlier, during the pre-match press conference ahead of the Wales-Azerbaijan game, Bale admitted that he is “more excited” about playing for his country than his club.</p>
      <p>Upon asked if playing for Wales gave him more “joy”, the 30-year-old said: “Yes, definitely.”</p>
      <p>“It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday. I’ve been with most of the older players since we were in Under-17s.”</p>
      <p>“It’s normal – with Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement playing with Wales,” he further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“But it doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100% on the pitch wherever I am.”</p>
