      <p>Dominic Thiem was at his dominant best as he dismantled defending champion Alexander Zverev 7-5 6-3 on Saturday to storm into the final of the season-ending ATP finals.</p>
      <p>LONDON: Dominic Thiem was at his dominant best as he dismantled defending champion Alexander Zverev 7-5 6-3 on Saturday to storm into the final of the season-ending ATP finals.</p>
      <p>Austrian Thiem, 26, will face Greek youngster Stefanos Tsitsipas on Sunday for the top prize at London's O2 Arena after he dispatched six-times champion Roger Federer.</p>

      <p>There was little to separate the players until the 12th game when a tense Zverev suddenly tightened up and double-faulted on set point to hand his rival the set.</p>
      <p>Zverev, who began this year's tournament in superb fashion by beating Rafael Nadal in a group clash, flung his racket across the court in frustration.</p>
      <p>Thiem, who has played glorious tennis this week despite suffering with a cold, looked the more solid player and broke the big-serving Zverev to take a 4-2 lead in the second set.</p>
      <p>Zverev had a chance to break back but world number five Thiem held firm to consolidate.</p>
      <p>Serving for the match, Thiem closed out victory on his first match point with a forehand passing shot down the line.</p>
      <p>Thiem is the first Austrian to reach the final of the ATP's exclusive year-ender in its 50-year history and it will be a fitting end to a superb season which caught fire after hiring former Olympic champion Nicolas Massu as coach.</p>
      <p>He has won five titles including his first Masters 1000 crown at Indian Wells. He also reached his second successive French Open final, losing to Nadal.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to the clash with 21-year-old debutant Tsitsipas, Thiem said: "One handed back-handed finals, I guess! We are both offensive players, he is very attractive to watch, I love to watch him and I am looking forward to playing him again.</p>
      <p>"And I'm happy to be playing again here tomorrow in front of this amazing atmosphere."</p>
