      <h2>TV presenter Jeff Brazier, 40, on raising his sons with Jade Goody alone, living to 111, and why he’s so proud of his survivor mum who also had to bring up his younger brother who has cerebral palsy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Brazier (talking to Adam Beresford), Ascot Administrator</a></address>

        <b>My mum had a tough relationship with my stepdad, and we had to run away to a women’s refuge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They were not good times… She had my brother, who has cerebral palsy, seven years after me.</p>
      <p>To have had the strength to deal with that and to look after my brother, and to cope with my stepdad’s insecurities and the failings in their relationship, she managed somehow to get us through.</p>
      <p>I’ve always thought she should feel really proud of that. Unfortunately, I’m not sure she sees it that way.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Taking part in the recent documentary Jade Goody: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain was something I had to do.</b>
      </p>
      <p>What tipped me towards doing it was my sons (Bobby, 16, and Freddie, 15) are going to watch it one day.</p>
      <p>I can’t control what anyone else says about her, but I can just tell some really positive, warm, lovely, funny stories about their mum.</p>
      <p>That’s going to be better for them to see.</p>

        <b>My boys may have slightly misconstrued the concept of what a regular day at work is.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Growing up they saw what their mum used to do and what my work/life balance has been like.</p>
      <p>But my oldest just started an apprenticeship and he’s commuting into London and working in an office.</p>
      <p>Of course there’s no reason his work can’t be like mine, but he’ll have to work hard to create that opportunity.</p>

        <b>I think it was a mistake that I didn’t play football for as long as I could.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you imagine what I’ve done for the last 11 years as a single parent, it’s been a fairly lonely path – you are the one person who all the responsibility falls on.</p>
      <p>It’s the complete opposite when you play football and you’re part of a team, a group that all pull together to achieve something.</p>

        <b>I always wanted to study again, after I gave up school to play football.</b>
      </p>
      <p>So when I had a session with a life coach, I decided it was something I’d like to become.</p>
      <p>I love it, I get so much satisfaction from doing it.</p>
      <p>It makes me feel good to help people work through something that’s difficult for them.</p>

        <b>I always say to myself I’m going to live to 111, and I believe I will because I’m doing everything I can to deserve that.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I wasn’t bothered about turning 40.</p>
      <p>I work really hard to stay fit and healthy, I don’t put anything in my body I shouldn’t.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It’s important to keep families together, so I do charity work with Ronald McDonald House.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They provide free accommodation for parents whose children are in hospital.</p>

        <b>For nine years I worked for <i>This Morning</i> , and the most special thing for me was being able to go away to film.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Because I was working, I didn’t feel guilty about leaving the boys for a couple of days.</p>
      <p>It was a chance for me to take stock and take a few deep breaths, so I could go back to life as a single parent with the right perspective and less stress.</p>
      <p>This was in a frozen lake in Lapland after I’d just had a sauna.</p>
      <p>It served as good preparation for going to the Andes for <i>SAS Who Dares Wins</i> . It also brought back a lot of memories, because when I was 17 I went to live in a place called Orland between Sweden and Finland.</p>
      <p>I played professional football for the team there, and I had the best six months of my life.</p>
