      <h1>Report suggests Leeds United defender Laurens De Bock could be sent back to Elland Road in January</h1>
      <h2>The Belgian has no long-term future at Elland Road.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:45:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United defender Laurens De Bock could be sent back to Elland Road if his loan spell at Sunderland does not pick up, according to a report. </p>
      <p>Sunderland snapped up the Belgian defender on loan toward the end of the transfer window. The defender had been completely frozen out by Marcelo Bielsa and was training alone in Belgium prior to the move. </p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/positions-sunderland-should-prioritise-january-17266995">The Chronicle is suggesting</a> why De Bock might be on his way back to West Yorkshire. Firstly, they report that De Bock was ‘very low down’ on Sunderland’s list of left-back targets in the summer. </p>

      <p>The report claims Sunderland have the option to send him back to Leeds if they decide to look for an alternative. The fact the Black Cats have recently changed manager, with Phil Parkinson taking over from Jack Ross, will not help De Bock’s cause. </p>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>If De Bock is returned to Leeds in January it will present another headache regarding getting rid of the player. Marcelo Bielsa clearly has no interest in using the player, who cost Leeds a <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-latest/leeds-united-defender-laurens-de-bock-set-for-loan-move-say-reports-in-greece-1-9914291">reported (YEP) £1.5 million </a>when signed from Club Brugge in January 2018. </p>
      <p>He spent last season at KV Oostende, who decided not to keep him on and a summer move to Aris fell through due to changes in personnel at the Greek side.</p>
      <p>Leeds will, therefore, have a fight on their hands finding another team to take De Bock’s wages off their hands if he ends up back at the club in January. Fans will hope he can turn things around at Sunderland and remain out of the picture at Leeds for the rest of the season.</p>
