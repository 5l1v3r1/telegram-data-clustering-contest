      <p>BAGHDAD: Anti-government demonstrators spread to a second bridge in the Iraqi capital on Saturday (Nov 16) after security forces retreated from a key area where they had clashed with protesters, AFP correspondents said.</p>
      <p>Sit-ins have become the go-to tactic for the regime change movement that erupted in early October, with a general strike announced by activists for Sunday.</p>

      <p>Protesters have occupied Baghdad's Tahrir (Liberation) Square since Oct 24, spilling over onto four bridges crossing the river Tigris.</p>
      <p>The bridges link east Baghdad to the city's west, including the Green Zone where the prime minister's office, parliament and foreign embassies are based.</p>
      <p>Security forces retook three of those bridges and nearby districts more than two weeks ago, pinning the protesters back in Tahrir and on Al-Jumhuriyah bridge with volleys of tear gas, live ammunition and even machine-gun fire.</p>
      <p>On Saturday morning, Iraqi units pulled back from some of those areas and crowds of protesters chased them down, resuming their sit-in at the mouth of Al-Sinek bridge.</p>
      <p>"The security forces withdrew to another concrete barrier on Al-Sinek," one protester told AFP.</p>
      <p>An elderly woman, who had travelled from the southern port city of Basra to join the rallies, cheered in support.</p>
      <p>"You didn't just lose us, you lost all of Iraq!" she said, addressing Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi.</p>
      <p>"Get out, get out, there's no place for you here. Tonight, we'll be in the Green Zone," she said.</p>
      <p>Dozens climbed up into a large parking complex near the bridge, unfurling a sign in support of demonstrators in nearby Tahrir.</p>
      <p>Others set up checkpoints around Tahrir, the morning after a bomb blast that shook the protesters.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, at least one person was killed and more than a dozen wounded in Tahrir when explosives beneath a parked car detonated, Iraq's state security forces said.</p>
      <p>Small clusters of men deployed around the square to search all those entering it throughout the day on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"We had a security breach yesterday and this explosion happened," said Abu Karrar al-Basrawi, a middle-aged man from Basra volunteering for the search.</p>
      <p>"But we've multiplied our checkpoints so it doesn't happen again," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Activists and medics have described a climate of fear setting in around Tahrir, saying that anonymous threats, kidnappings and even killings are an attempt to snuff out the movement.</p>
      <p>Late on Friday, activist Adnan Rustum was shot dead near his home in Baghdad, his relatives said.</p>
      <p>And on Saturday, a person died of wounds sustained the previous day in protests in the southern city of Nasiriyah.</p>
      <p>More than 330 people have been killed since the protests erupted in October and over 15,000 have been wounded, but officials are not releasing updated or precise figures.</p>
