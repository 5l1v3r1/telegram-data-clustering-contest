      <p>A convicted stalker has been jailed after creeping into a young woman's home and kissing her while she slept.</p>
      <p>Just three months after Ian Essom was convicted for repeatedly stalking a girl half his age while she worked at a petrol station, he began obsessing over his next victim.</p>
      <p>At about 1am on November 18, 2018, Essom crept into his new victim's home and kissed her while she slept in bed, before restraining her as she attempted to resist.</p>
      <p>Only three months earlier, Essom, now 41, had been handed a two-year restraining order for repeatedly gazing at another young woman through a window as she worked late shifts at a petrol station.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old was so disturbed by him staring at her, she pressed the panic alarm and Essopm was arrested and charged with stalking offences.</p>

      <p>Detective Sergeant Terry Rush, from the domestic abuse prevention and investigation team said: "Essom frightened the victim so much she had to leave her job at the petrol station and became isolated in her own home.</p>
      <p>"She became paranoid and would be in constant fear of where he would be at any given time."</p>
      <p>The Northampton man was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison suspended for 12 months and ordered to pay Â£2,500 in compensation on August 23, 2018.</p>
      <p>Then, less than three months after his conviction, the Northampton man entered a property in Olney in the small hours of the morning and found his second victim asleep in bed.</p>
      <p>He began kissing her and restrained her when she resisted before fleeing the home.</p>
      <p>Following a one-day trial at Aylesbury Crown Court, a jury found Esson guilty of committing trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.</p>
      <p>Essom of Northampton, was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life as he was sentenced to jail.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer Detective Constable Kim McHugh of Milton Keynes police station, said: "I would like to thank the victim for coming forward to police and for supporting us with the investigation.</p>
      <p>"She has shown great strength in giving evidence at trial.</p>
      <p>"Thames Valley Police does not tolerate this behaviour and we will work tirelessly to investigate thoroughly and bring offenders to justice.</p>
      <p>"I hope this conviction gives others the confidence to come forward and make a report to the police."</p>
