      <h2>It was a champion of a day when a group of athletes paid a visit to a residential home in West Bromwich.</h2>

      <p>Former British middleweight boxing champion Jason Welborn joined Kevin Brown, former English discus-throwing champ, at Goldfield Court, which provides homes for the over-55s and those in need of extra care.</p>
      <p>The highlight of the afternoon came when Kevin pulled a Transit van across the car park of the Dartmouth Street apartments.</p>

      <p>Canisus Alcindor, champion high jumper, and a leading karate expert was also there. The athletes showed off their medals while Jason, a 29-year-old boxer, from Wolverhampton, brought in his boxing belts.</p>
      <p>All the athletes also posed for photographs and signed autographs.</p>
      <p>The event was organised by carer Denise Carroll at Housing 21, which specialises in accommodation for the elderly.</p>

      <p>Assistant housing manager Eileen Pike said: "It was a brilliant day. Everyone had been looking forward to it and we had a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>"The day was essentially about looking to the future. It used to be that people thought of the elderly as the Dad's Army era but people coming into accommodation for the elderly now were fans of Duran Duran and other 1980s bands.</p>
      <p>"The organisation started out providing housing for British Army veterans, now we're installing the latest technology for residents. They will soon have TV screens in their rooms so they can see who is at the door before they let anyone in at night."</p>
