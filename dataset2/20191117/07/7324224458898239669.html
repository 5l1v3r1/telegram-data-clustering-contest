      <p>Nearly 100 students from Ellowes Hall Sports College have been involved with the production of Miss Saigon, which will be performed between November 20 and 29.</p>
      <p>Auditions for the show took place in April and since the new school term started in September, students have been working every lunchtime on the production.</p>
      <p>Students who will be acting, singing, dancing and performing in the orchestra have been rehearsing for hours, while behind the scenes others have been working on stage management, lighting, sound engineering, make-up and wardrobe.</p>
      <p>Miss Saigon is based on Giacomo Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly and tells the tragic tale of a doomed romance involving an Asian woman abandoned by her American lover.</p>
      <p>Sarah Waterfield, from Ellowes Hall, said: "The students and staff have worked extremely hard and put in so many hours of rehearsals and always given it their all, to ensure we give the audience the fantastic show they will no doubt be expecting.</p>
      <p>"We are extremely proud of the students and look forward to some fantastic performances over the next two weeks.‚Äù</p>
      <p>The musical will be performing at 7.30pm on November 20, 21 and 22; 2pm on November 23; and 7.30pm on November 27, 28 and 29.</p>
