      <h1>'Finally' - Aston Villa's John McGinn makes Celtic and Rangers admission</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | The AVFC midfielder has turned into a talisman on the domestic and international stage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:54:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>John McGinn has revealed that Celtic and Rangers' Europa League exploits have had a positive impact on his life at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa.</a></p>
      <p>The Scotland international has been in fine form for Dean Smith's side since his move from Hibernian in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>After signing from under the noses of Celtic, for around £2.75m, McGinn has earned a reputation as one of the best midfield players in the country.</p>

      <p>He has taken that form onto the international stage, as Steve Clark's side look to find a way into the Euro 2020 qualification shake-up. And those positive results for the Tartan Army, along with the Old Firm's performances in Europe have eased a bit of the training ground ribbing.</p>

      <p>“The big thing for me is I’m craving success here to go down, finally, with a smile on my face.</p>
      <p>“Too many times, I’ve gone down the road off the back of a poor result. We know we have the ability here and the players in the squad to change that. English people’s view of Scottish football is something I don’t think we’ll change but results like Celtic and Rangers had in Europe a couple of Thursdays ago help at Friday morning training an awful lot.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinn was widely expected to join Celtic last summer, before Steve Bruce managed to get a deal over the line for him to come to B6. In a recent television interview, he refused to rule out a move to Parkhead in the future.</p>
      <p>“You never say never in football," he said. "When you’ve got that instilled in you it never really does leave you. Obviously the circumstances mean that I’m now an Aston Villa player but I’ll just take each year as it comes and if it does happen down the line then who knows.”</p>
