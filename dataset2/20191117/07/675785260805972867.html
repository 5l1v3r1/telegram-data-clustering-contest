      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>It's been almost a decade since the tragic death of Amy Winehouse, who was just 27 when she passed away.</p>
      <p>After years of battling addiction, she died from alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011.</p>
      <p>Just months before her death, Amy had checked into rehab to get ready for her European tour that summer.</p>
      <p>It was claimed that Amy's manager and her dad Mitch Winehouse didn't want her to stop performing, despite her fragile state - something Mitch denies.</p>
      <p>In 2009 she was recovering in Saint Lucia and her dad turned up with a camera crew, something they argued over.</p>
      <p>She told him: "Why have you done this to me? You have to come out with a camera crew! Are you only interested in what you can get out of me?"</p>

      <p>She managed a few months of sobriety in 2010, but reportedly downed several bottles of wine before getting on stage at what was meant to her comeback gig in Serbia.</p>
      <p>She was booed off stage by the 20,000-strong crowd, who also pelted her with paper cups after she stumbled through songs and forgot lyrics.</p>
      <p>The tour was promptly cancelled.</p>

      <p>Around this time Amy had also broken up with her boyfriend Reg Traviss, who had reportedly become fed up of her drinking.</p>
      <p>He had been there at her bedside when doctors had told her to stop boozing or die.</p>
      <p>Despite moving on with Travis, Amy seemed to still have feelings for her ex, Blake Fielder-Civil.</p>

      <p>In 2010, a year after they divorced and one year before her death, she'd tweeted: "I love my husband Blake an it ain't wrong! Marry for life."</p>
      <p>Blake has admitted that he was the one who introduced her to heroin.</p>
      <p>While she'd managed to give up drugs before she died, years of abuse on her body had taken its toll.</p>

      <p>Two weeks before she died it was claimed that she suffered a seizure and was found collapsed in a London street.</p>
      <p>Her last public performance came just two days before her death when she joined her goddaughter and protege Dionne Bromfield on stage at The Roundhouse in London.</p>
      <p>Amy had one, final conversation with her bodyguard, Andrew Morris, before she went to bed on the evening of July 22</p>

      <p>He said: "She was showing me some clips on her laptop and she was singing and she said 'boy, I can sing' and I said 'damn right, you can sing.</p>
      <p>"She said 'if I could I would give it back just to walk down the street with no hassle, I would'."</p>
      <p>The next morning Andrew found Amy motionless on her bed.</p>
