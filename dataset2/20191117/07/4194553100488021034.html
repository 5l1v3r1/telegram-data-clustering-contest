      <h1>Napoli sweat over extent of Mertensâ€™ injury ahead of Liverpool clash in the Champions League</h1>

      <p>Serie A giants Napoli are worried about the extent of an injury their star player Dries Mertens picked up while on international duty with Belgium.</p>
      <p>The attacker was brought down by a strong challenge from a Russian defender as the Red Devils looked like adding a fourth goal to their tally on the night.</p>
      <p>Mertens tried to continue, but was forced off shortly after the 50th minute. It remains to be seen just how bad his injury is, but it has thrown doubt on the Champions League fixture against Liverpool.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146528/mertens-injured-belgium">As per Football Italia</a>, local media have reported that he was taken off as a precaution, but thereâ€™s no doubt that Napoli will be sweating over this.</p>
      <p>The Naples outfit had a controversial affair the last time they faced the Reds, with Jose Callejon being gifted a penalty against Liverpool.</p>

      <p>We went on to lose that game 2-0, and we canâ€™t really complain about the second goal, but the Reds will be seeking revenge against the Italian on the 27th of this month when they visit Anfield.</p>
      <p>Mertens would go on to suggest that heâ€™s fine on social media, but itâ€™s unclear if heâ€™ll spend some time on the sidelines.</p>
