      <p>The anti-Trump conservative lawyer is 'having a tough time' in his marriage to top Donald Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway, a report says.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/George-Conway/">George Conway</a> believes that his wife, top Donald Trump advisor <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/Kellyanne-Conway/">Kellyanne Conway</a>, is “in a cult,” and his now-strained marriage to her will not improve until she leaves the Trump “cult,” according to a report published this week by <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/kellyanne-caught-in-west-wing-cross-fire-as-george-goes-full-resistance"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a> magazine. In sharp opposition to his wife, one of Trump’s most consistent and vociferous defenders, George Conway has become one of Trump’s harshest critics.</p>
      <p>A conservative lawyer who was reportedly considered by Trump for the position of United States Solicitor General in 2017, George Conway has become known for his near-daily Twitter posts ripping into Trump’s character and mental health.</p>
      <p>In an appearance this week on <i>MSNBC</i>, commenting on Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5742606/donald-trump-impeachment-hearing-video-clips/">opening televised impeachment</a> hearings against Trump, Conway described himself as “horrified” and “appalled” at Trump’s actions in office.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I could have imagined a president, any president, engaging in this sort of conduct,” he said on <i>MSNBC</i>.</p>
      <p>But friends of Conway told <i>Vanity Fair</i> reporter Gabriel Sherman that the 56-year-old litigation attorney is “going through a tough time” and that his marriage to Kellyanne has grown “increasingly distant as impeachment has gained steam.” But he, nonetheless, still loves Kellyanne anyway, the friends told Sherman.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to get better until she’s cast out of the cult,” a person “close” to Conway told Sherman.</p>

      <p>Her husband’s repeated verbal assaults on Trump have caused tension for Kellyanne Conway inside the White House, Sherman also reported. Trump blames her for the high-profile platform George Conway enjoys for his Twitter assaults. Trump’s advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has reportedly tried to persuade his father-in-law to fire Kellyanne, according to the <i>Vanity Fair</i> story.</p>
      <p>The alleged tensions in the Conway marriage have spilled over into Kellyanne’s public appearances. When <i>CNN</i> anchor Wolf Blitzer mentioned “issues” in her marriage in an interview on Wednesday, Kellyanne Conway seemed to lose her cool, according to a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kellyanne-conway-blows-up-at-cnns-wolf-blitzer-for-saying-there-are-issues-with-her-marriage"><i>Daily Beast</i></a> account.</p>

      <p>“Did you just say there are issues there? You don’t want to talk about — why would you say that?” she snapped at Blitzer, accusing the longtime <i>CNN</i> anchor of trying to “stick it” to her.</p>
      <p>“Let me be very clear. You didn’t stick it to Kellyanne Conway,” she exclaimed, going on to tell Blitzer, “you embarrassed yourself and I’m embarrassed for you.”</p>
      <p>George Conway, however, recently extended his attacks to Donald Trump Jr., after the younger Trump lashed out at Conway on Twitter. Trump Jr. called Conway, “a guy who routinely &amp; publicly embarrasses his wife.”</p>
      <p>Conway quoted Trump Jr.’s tweet on his own <a href="https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1195444185429684224?s=20">Twitter</a> feed, chiding the younger Trump by saying, “I’ve worked for three decades at a job that my father didn’t get me.”</p>
