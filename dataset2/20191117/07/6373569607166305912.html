      <h1>Antoni Sarcevic on his mission to return Plymouth Argyle to League One at first attempt</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder wants to repay the Green Army after the pain of relegation last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:44:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Midfielder Antoni Sarcevic is a man on a mission and Plymouth Argyle getting promoted to League One is his motivation.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is playing some of his best and most consistent football of his career under Ryan Lowe this term.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic grabbed his fourth goal of the campaign<a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle"> in the 1-0 win away to table-topping Forest Green Rovers</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He was part of the Pilgrims’ squad under Derek Adams which was promoted from League Two in 2016/17.</p>
      <p>Then, last season, the strong-running midfielder felt the pain of relegation after Argyle’s disastrous collapse in form over the closing weeks.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic believes Argyle have the best fanbase in the division ‘by an absolute mile’ and wants to repay the Green Army for that.</p>
      <p>After nearly three years at the club, Sarcevic has admitted that Argyle is ‘a place to proper close to my heart’.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims are up to 11th in League Two after beating Forest Green, courtesy of Sarcevic’s 24th minute goal.</p>
      <p>They have won three of their last four league games and are only two points away from the play-off positions, and four adrift of third place.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic made it clear after the win against Forest Green that promotion was the ultimate goal.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s the biggest thing on my mind this season, making sure that the lads are on the same page.</p>
      <p>“It’s a club that’s a massive piece of me now and I think I owe a lot to the club and the fans, for Argyle to get them back up into League One.”</p>

      <p>Sarcevic has been at Argyle for almost three years now, signing for them as a free agent in January 2017 after leaving Shrewsbury Town the previous November.</p>
      <p>He has gone on to make a total of 112 appearances for the Pilgrims and his strike against Forest Green was his 12th goal.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic said: “It’s a place that is proper close to my heart and my family’s. I have raised both of my boys here (in Plymouth).</p>
      <p>“My Missus has adapted and my family love coming down and visiting.</p>
      <p>“We have took 1,200 to Forest Green. It’s the best fanbase by an absolute mile in this league and we need to make sure we repay that.”</p>
      <p>With Argyle starting to show some form and the redeveloped Mayflower Grandstand at Home Park about to reopen next month the future could be bright for the Pilgrims.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic said: “It’s exciting isn’t it? We have just got to make sure we do the stuff on the pitch and then we can all enjoy the latter stages of the season.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s winning goal against Forest Green came straight off the training ground as it involved a short corner routine between Sarcevic and Danny Mayor.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic swapped passes with Mayor before working his way inside into the Forest Green penalty area and getting in a shot.</p>
      <p>The ball struck Rovers’ defender Ferrand Rawson on the way as it flew into the roof of the net.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic said: “We work on it, with me and Danny going short, and trying to work something.</p>
      <p>“I have just seen him with only one man and it’s something we worked on in training. I have just come inside.</p>
      <p>“As soon as it opened up, I knew I had connected well with it. It was just nice to see it hit the back of the net.”</p>
      <p>Sarcevic has always had the potential to be a 10-goal-a-season midfielder, and did that during a successful period at Fleetwood Town.</p>

      <p>He has not been able to repeat that at Argyle, but with four under his belt already this term and lots of football still to be played, he is on target to do it.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic said: “It’s something I always had in my game, but it’s something I was frustrated with the last couple of seasons.</p>
      <p>“The Gaffer (Lowe) had faith in me at the start of the season and I’m just trying to do my best to repay that and help the team as much as I can because that’s all that matters to me.”</p>
