      <h2>Downplaying the Congress' surprise revival in the recently concluded Haryana Assembly elections, Singh said the situation is "completely different" in Delhi, claiming that no one even mentions Congress here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:36:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Ruling out a pre-poll alliance with the Congress for the upcoming Assembly elections in Delhi, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said the contest is between the ruling <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/aam-aadmi-party/">Aam Aadmi Party</a> and the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> and that the grand old party “is not even in the competition”.</p>
      <p>Downplaying the Congress’ surprise revival in the recently concluded Haryana Assembly elections, Singh said the situation is “completely different” in Delhi, adding that no one even mentions Congress here. In the 2015 assembly elections, AAP won 67 of the 70 seats and the BJP got the rest, while the Congress drew a blank.</p>
      <p>Alliance talks between the two parties failed ahead of the Lok Sabha elections this year over a disagreement on tie-up in Haryana.  All seven Lok Sabha seats were subsequently won by the BJP.</p>
      <p>In an interview with news agency PTI, Singh exclaimed confidence in the party’s return to power in the national capital. “In Delhi, people have seen our work and they are happy with it. They will vote based on that,” he said.</p>
      <p>About the agenda of the AAP for the upcoming polls, Singh said, in the last five years, the AAP government reached out to every section of the society through its schemes — whether it was education to benefit children and youth, ‘tirth <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yatra/">yatra</a>’ for the elderly, free travel for women in buses or CCTV installation for their safety.</p>
      <p>The AAP government recently rolled out free bus ride scheme for women on all DTC and cluster buses. “This shows how we believe in taking everyone forward. These are the agenda that the AAP will pursue again if it is voted to power,” he told the news agency.</p>
      <p>To a question whether the recent announcement of the Centre to regularise unauthorised colonies in Delhi can prove to be a game-changer for the BJP, Singh said it is another “jumla” of the saffron party.</p>
      <p>“It took four years to take the decision of regularising unauthorised colonies. They did it right before the election. Now, they are saying they will pass a bill and then registration needs to be done on a website. In this manner, the election will get over. If they are honest about the issue, they should have been brought it earlier,” he said.</p>
      <p>If the BJP was serious about this move, they could have brought an ordinance for it, Singh said, adding, “But it was not done. It is nothing but a ‘jumla’ and their intentions are not genuine.”</p>
      <p>The Union Cabinet approved in October a proposal to grant ownership rights to people living in unauthorised colonies in Delhi.</p>
