      <p>A Derby mum who was given just 72 hours to live has told how a total stranger saved her life.</p>
      <p>Diana Higman was juggling life as a single mum with nurse training, when she first started to feel tired.</p>
      <p>After the death of her dad, doctors put her exhaustion down to stress and asked her to have some blood tests to rule out anything serious.</p>
      <p>What started out as a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/health">routine blood test, turned into a terrifying and life-changing experience.</a></p>
      <p>Now the 56-year-old has shared her story of how a stranger whose liver she received saved her.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was nearly 11 years ago I became ill. I was doing my nurse training and my dad had died not long before.</p>
      <p>"I was really tired but the doctor put it down to stress.</p>
      <p>"It was recommended that I have some blood tests and I left them for a while but one day I was on placement at the<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/woman-distress-burton-bridge-police-3283129"> hospital and I popped down </a>to have it done.</p>
      <p>"Next thing I know, I was being put on a super urgent transplant list and was given 72 hours to live."</p>
      <p>Diana was diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis and was in desperate need of a new liver, as hers was shrinking rapidly.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for a liver transplant which I was not expecting.</p>
      <p>"I was so scared, miles away from home and all alone. They came Friday and said we have a liver, but after tests later that day they said it was too big and wouldn’t fit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/pink-fire-engine-organ-donation-3278942">"They put me on a list</a> which searches all over the UK for an organ. This was a very scary time as they said my liver would only last a couple of days."</p>

      <p>The next day Diana was told another organ was ready for her, but her spirits were low.</p>
      <p>She said: "I didn’t really get too optimistic then as I realised that someone was losing their life for me to live.</p>
      <p>"It messes with your head big time, but due to toxins in my brain from my liver not working properly, this didn’t really hit me fully 'till after the operation.</p>
      <p>"They came and said we going to harvest your liver which is a horrible way of explaining it."</p>
      <p>Diana recalls the night of the transplant as being the "longest night of her life."</p>
      <p>She said: "At around 6am on Sunday, September 14, 2008, I looked up to see all the doctors around my bed and then we were off to theatre</p>
      <p>" I can remember the anaesthetist had just had a coffee as I smelled it and remember saying to him jokingly "what I would do for a cup of coffee right now."</p>

        <figcaption>Diana is now back to strength and is a medal winning sportswoman</figcaption>

      <p>"When I woke I had a lovely nurse that was like an angel so gentle and then took a look at my 53 staples holding me together."</p>
      <p>Diana, who lives in Derby, said the transplant took more than a year to get over and she could not walk or even open a bottle of milk after the operation.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was in and out of the hospital for almost two years and I lost three stone.</p>
      <p>"When I first went home I couldn’t walk, open a bottle of milk, or get off the sofa without help. I had lost all my muscle and I looked so poorly."</p>
      <p>Before her transplant, Diana was a keen sportswoman and she was worried she would be unable to participate in sports like before, but then she discovered the World Transplant Games.</p>
      <p>She said: "I thought my life as I knew it was done and I was only 45.</p>
      <p>"But then I saw a poster for transplant sport and all the people on there looked normal. I thought I will get better.</p>

        <figcaption>Diana said the 'hero' donor has completely changed her life</figcaption>

      <p>"I got in touch with them and never looked back."</p>
      <p>Diana said it was an "uphill struggle" which started with baby steps.</p>
      <p>She said: "I started swimming with a rubber ring and then I tried my hand at cycling. I got an old bike off eBay.</p>
      <p>"I did the race in Bath in 2010 but I kept getting lapped and said that I would never get on a bike again, but guess what - I did."</p>
      <p>Since then Diana has won seven gold medals, three silver, medals and one bronze, and has travelled to places including Sweden and South Africa in cycling.</p>
      <p>Diana, who now just has <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/pink-fire-engine-organ-donation-3278942">medication now and check-ups every six months,</a> said she will "always be in awe" of her donor, who has given her "at least 11 extra years of life" with her family.</p>
      <p>She said: "My donor gave me the chance and for that I will always be thankful. I have had 11 more years seen my daughters grow up, graduate, I have a grandchild on the way.</p>
      <p>"If you are willing to accept an organ you should be willing to give an organ, you can’t take them with you.</p>
      <p>"Put yourself in that position of needing one. For me, organ donation has been truly life-changing."</p>
