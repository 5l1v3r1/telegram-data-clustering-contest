      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:08:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nnorth-east/363679-nigerian-troops-rescue-women-children-from-boko-haram-official.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Nigerian troops deployed in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State have rescued women and children from Boko Haram captivity.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Nigerian Army, Aminu Iliyasu, said in a statement on Sunday that the victims were rescued after some Boko Haram fighters were subdued in the local government area on Saturday. The victims included four women and four children.</p>
      <p>Mr Iliyasu, a colonel, said the children were administered with polio vaccination by a military medical team. An elderly woman in her 80s was amongst those rescued, but it was unclear whether she needed immediate medical care.</p>
      <p>No military causality was recorded during the operation, Mr Ilyasu said. Suspected Boko Haram elements fled the local government into the Mandara Mountains with gunshot wounds, he said.</p>

      <p>“The troops’ resilience and doggedness are unwavering as further exploitation to complete annihilation of the insurgents is being sustained in the mountainous environment,” he said.</p>
      <p>The victims joined thousands of other Nigerians rescued from Boko Haram captivity in recent years. The insurgents regularly abduct citizens in the war-ravaged northeast for use as recruits, slaves or ransom.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said Nigerian troops would continue to extract credible intelligence on the presence of some of Boko Haram insurgents across the region.</p>
