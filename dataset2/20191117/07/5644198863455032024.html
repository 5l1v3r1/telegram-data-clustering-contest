      <p>Croatia qualified for Euro 2020 after second-half goals from Nikola Vlasic, Bruno Petkovic and Ivan Perisic inspired a comeback 3-1 home win over Slovakia in a pulsating Group E qualifier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>RIJEKA, Croatia: Croatia qualified for Euro 2020 after second-half goals from Nikola Vlasic, Bruno Petkovic and Ivan Perisic inspired a comeback 3-1 home win over Slovakia in a pulsating Group E qualifier on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The result left the Croatians on 17 points from eight games as they completed their campaign, with three sides behind them still in contention for next year's 24-nation tournament.</p>

      <p>Second-placed Hungary (12 points) visit third-placed Wales (11 points) on Tuesday in a dogfight for a top-two finish where a win would see either through.</p>
      <p>A draw, however, could allow fourth-placed Slovakia (10 points), who are at home to bottom team Azerbaijan in their final game, to squeeze through as they have a better head-to-head record against the Hungarians.</p>
      <p>Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic, who guided them to a runners-up finish at the 2018 World Cup, was delighted.</p>
      <p>"I am proud and I congratulate the players for winning the group and qualifying," he said.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't worried when we fell behind because we were playing well and it was much easier after we equalised.</p>
      <p>"All credit to the fans too who turned up in numbers and I hope we will bring more joy to Croatia in the European Championship."</p>
      <p>Petkovic added: "We vowed not to lose our heads if we conceded first and managed to turn it around because we kept our composure. This young team has a very good chemistry."</p>
      <p>Croatia squandered a flurry of first-half chances and were punished in the 32nd minute when Robert Bozenik turned in a Stanislav Lobotka cross from the left.</p>
      <p>Bozenik almost doubled Slovakia's lead as Croatia keeper Dominik Livakovic just managed to tip over the 19-year-old striker's ferocious drive from the edge of the penalty area.</p>
      <p>Yet that was as good as it got for Slovakia on a rainy night in the coastal city of Rijeka, as Croatia turned the tide with a fierce second-half onslaught.</p>
      <p>Vlasic equalised in the 56th minute with a low drive from 20 metres and Petkovic fired Croatia ahead four minutes later when he powered an unstoppable header into the top corner after Luka Modric swung in an inch-perfect corner.</p>
      <p>Slovakia had winger Robert Mak sent off in the 66th minute for a second bookable foul before Perisic added the third for the home side, volleying home a Borna Barisic assist to delight a packed home crowd in Rujevica stadium.</p>
      <p>Slovakia keeper Martin Dubravka spared Slovakia a heavier defeat with several fine saves in the closing stages.</p>
