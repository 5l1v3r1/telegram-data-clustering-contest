      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:31:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:31</time> by <a rel="author">Horatiu Boeriu</a></address>
      <p>The BMW Warranty from the factory has always been regarded as one of the best in the industry. For many years, BMW touted their free maintenance of 4-years or 50,000 miles program which was a great selling point for the company in the US. Everything was covered on new BMWs – wiper blades, brake pads, rotors and scheduled service.</p>
      <p>But in 2017, the program changed, inline with the competitors in the premium segment. Since some of you might be in the market for a new BMW, we put together a short guide on the BMW Warranty in 2019.</p>
      <h3>BMW Warranty On New Cars</h3>
      <p>The following applies to vehicles sold in the United States. According to BMW of North America, the New BMW Warranty program includes a limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship, valid for four years or 50,000 miles (whichever comes first), regardless of first or subsequent owners.</p>
      <p>If your BMW experiences a problem with its engine, transmission/transaxle, transfer case, or drivetrain within the first four years or 50,000 miles, you’ll also be covered with the Powertrain Warranty, which is part of the factory warranty.</p>
      <p>The BMW factory warranty also includes a Corrosion/Rust Warranty that lasts for 12 years/unlimited miles. BMW says that you will be protected if your car experiences rust due to any defects, .</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you’ll also have a Federal Emissions Warranty for eight years or 80,000 miles, which will cover you if the vehicle doesn’t meet the EPA-required emissions standards.</p>
      <h3>No Cost Items Included In The BMW Warranty</h3>
      <p>The new car BMW factory warranty also comes with Unlimited-Mileage Roadside Assistance, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for the first four years. Included also is the BMW TeleService in your vehicle which actually reports to BMW when it needs service.</p>
      <h3>The BMW Maintenance Program</h3>
      <p>BMW of North America posted in their service bulletin that all model year 2017 BMW vehicles and newer sold or leased by an authorized BMW center come with BMW Ultimate Care standard for the first 3 years or 36,000 miles whichever comes first.</p>
      <p>Only the following maintenance items are included with BMW Ultimate Care when they are performed as outlined in the vehicle’s Maintenance booklet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engine Oil</li>
        <li>Engine Filter</li>
        <li>Brake Fluid</li>
        <li>Cabin Micro Filter(s)</li>
        <li>Engine Air Filter(s)</li>
        <li>Spark Plugs</li>
        <li>Remote Control/Key Battery</li>
        <li>Vehicle Check</li>
        <li>Fuel Filter (Diesel engines only)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What Are Your Options After The Original Warranty Expires</h3>
      <p>You can actually extend you BMW Warranty before it even expires. BMW dealers offer a BMW Extended Vehicle Protection with different tiers, ranging from 5 to 7 years, and 75,000 or 100,000 miles. <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/content/dam/bmwusa/financial-services/protection-products/BMW_Extended_Service_Contract_Brochure.pdf">The levels of coverage</a> as labeled as Powertrain Plus, Gold and Platinum.</p>
      <p>Another option will be to buy your <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/08/03/what-to-do-if-your-bmw-car-warranty-has-expired/">BMW extended warranty</a> from a third-party company. We recommend to always research the BMW Extended Warranty Coverage and decide if it’s good for you. Also, you should look for a warranty company that will give the BMW dealership their credit card over the phone, rather than you paying the bill first and chase them afterward.</p>
