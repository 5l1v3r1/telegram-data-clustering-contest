        <b>Liverpool FC Women’s captain Sophie Bradley-Auckland has spoken of the immense “honour” it will be for the team to play at Anfield on Sunday.</b>

      <p>Dreams will become a reality for many on Sunday when Vicky Jepson’s side take to the field at Anfield for the first time in the Women’s Super League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/everton">Everton</a>, who sit in fifth position heading into the weekend, are the visitors as the Reds look to notch the first win of their league campaign.</p>
      <p>The opportunity to play at Anfield is one few have experienced in the women’s game and the fact that it is in a derby heightens the emotions for Bradley-Auckland and Co.</p>
      <p>“It will be a massive honour to lead the girls out but just to play at Anfield is amazing,” she <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/women/373581-sophie-bradley-auckland-honoured-to-captain-lfc-women-at-anfield">told</a> the club website.</p>

      <p>“It means so much to so many of the players because we not only play for Liverpool but we support Liverpool as well and what better game than a derby.</p>
      <p>“Whenever you play in a derby there’s always that extra bit of fight and energy going round the pitch and it’s always a different buzz so it’s fantastic that this game will be played at Anfield.”</p>
      <p>For the skipper herself, she has overcome major injury setbacks throughout her career to become a mainstay at the heart of the Reds’ defence since arriving in 2018.</p>
      <p>Bradley-Auckland was named the Players’ Player of the Year at the conclusion of last season and pride was the overwhelming emotion upon reflection.</p>
      <p>But another moment which has taken “everyone’s breath away” in and around the squad now awaits at the spiritual home of Liverpool Football Club, where up to 15,000 people are expected to take to the stands.</p>

      <p>“It definitely has paid off. I’m super proud, just to be back playing football for me is a massive thing and then to have had a decent season here at Liverpool last year means the world to me and my family,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“It’s a huge honour for all the girls to think we can play here and for it to be happening means so much.</p>
      <p>“It took everyone’s breath away a bit when we heard because that’s how much it means to us.”</p>
