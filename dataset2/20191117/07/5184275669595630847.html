      <p>Whether one likes it or not, Shahid Kapoor’s last release <i>Kabir Singh</i> did a thunderous performance at the box office and despite receiving flak from several corners of the society, Kabir Singh has gone on to collect over <b>250 crores</b>. And now, acclaimed filmmaker Nandita Das has lashed out at the success of the film.</p>
      <p>Nandita, who last directed Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s Manto is not a lady to mince words. Lashing out at the plot of Kabir Singh, Nandita explains for the film not only justifies but also celebrates misogyny and male chauvinism.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Huffington Post in her recent interaction, Nandita has been quoted saying, “Whether it’s a propaganda film or a regressive film like <i>Kabir Singh</i>, there are two ways. One, where we look inwards: can we become more discerning? Can we choose not to watch it and enable more of the same? If I don’t like a <i>Kabir Singh</i>, I will talk about how misogynistic that film is. I will express dissent.”</p>
      <p>She added, “But at the same time, cinema is also a reflection of society. If such a film is being made and it does well, what does that say about us? The audience is complicit. Even politically, there’s a complicity in all of us if we’re letting it—whatever that is going on—happen. It’s a scary, slippery slope: in the name of freedom, we don’t want hate speeches, we don’t want propaganda, we don’t want misogyny.”</p>
      <p>She further said, “The success is, in straightforward terms, indicative of societal numbness, apathy and brutal celebration of misogyny. The success just validates a certain male narrative where you’re okay being violent towards women.”</p>
      <p>Directed by Sandeep Vanga Reddy, <i>Kabir Singh</i> was a remake to the super hit South film Arjun Reddy originally featuring Vijay Devearakonda. Kabir Singh featured Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani in lead roles and revolved around a violent, heartbroken doctor who eventually takes to drugs.</p>
