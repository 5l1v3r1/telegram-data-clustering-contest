      <h1>(Video) Nicest man in football Sadio Mane invites lookalike fan on Senegal team bus</h1>

      <p>Sadio Mane has once again proved he may just be the nicest man in football, as he’s likely made some Senegalese lad’s dream come true.</p>
      <p>A fan of the Lions of Teranga approach the Liverpool star by way of the team bus windscreen, before the <i>real </i>Sadio clocked that the young man had styled his hair to look like him – the fan’s high cheekbones also help him strike an uncanny resemblance from certain angles.</p>
      <p>Obviously flattered, Mane asked security to bring him onto the team bus and meet the rest of the team. What an absolute fella.</p>
