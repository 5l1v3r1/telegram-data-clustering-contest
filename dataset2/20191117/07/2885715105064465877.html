      <p>Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman says he never imagined acting on stage or in front of the camera as he wasn’t ”raised to be the centre of attention”.</p>
      <p>The actor, who became a global star with his Marvel stint as Black Panther aka T’Challa, the king and protector of Wakanda, said he always had a story or a song playing in his head but he never thought of pursuing career in the entertainment industry.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t ever see myself on stage, or in front of the camera. Part of that is personality. I wasn’t necessarily raised to be the centre of attention.</p>
      <p>”But I always had a story, a song, or a soundtrack going on in my head. I just never saw it as something you were supposed to do,” Boseman told The Times.</p>
      <p>The actor, however, is enjoying the financial stability which has come with the fame.</p>
      <p>”Being able to do things for your family is more significant to me. My parents were always frugal when I was growing up. They sacrificed a lot for us. So paying for something my dad wants is very meaningful to me. He can’t grasp it, though. Like, ‘I can still fix this old car!’ And I have to say, ‘No, Dad. Let’s do away with that. We’re getting a new one’,” he added.</p>
