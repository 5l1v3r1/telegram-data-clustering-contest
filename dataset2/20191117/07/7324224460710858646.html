      <h1>Hednesford street name tribute to war hero</h1>
      <h2>A Hednesford resident's war hero grandfather has been recognised by way of a street name in a new development.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:58:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/jordan-reynolds/" target="_blank">Jordan Reynolds</a></address>
      <p>Gordon Taylor, 82, who was born and raised in West Chadsmoor, was thrilled to discover that his grandfather, William Henry Sockett, had been commemorated at the development where his name now lives on in the form of Sockett Drive.</p>
      <p>The Limes, which is located on Limepit Lane, derives its street names from war heroes in the local area, with Gordon’s grandfather, Mr Sockett, being one of many veterans the roads are dedicated to.</p>
      <p>William, who is buried at Erquinghem Lys Military Cemetery, near Armentieres in Northern France, was a miner at the Littleton Colliery and joined the South Staffordshire regiment at the age of 38 in 1914.</p>
      <p>The war hero died in action the following year in an act of bravery, when he attempted to retrieve a stretcher for an injured colleague while under heavy shell fire.</p>
      <p>Gordon, an ex-chairman of the Staffordshire Regimental Association, has continued to keep the spirit of his grandfather’s legacy alive through his work with the organisation.</p>

      <p>The Regiment was formed in 1705 by Col. Luke Willington, at the Kings Head Public House in Lichfield, while the Hednesford Branch of the Staffordshire Regimental association was created years later in 1951.</p>
      <p>Previous members of the North Staffordshire Regiment, South Staffordshire Regiment and Staffordshire Regiment meet regularly at the Hednesford Soldiers Club.</p>
      <p>With attendees ranging in ages from 40 to 92, each member of the group has their own remarkable story to tell.</p>
      <p>For Gordon, the street names at The Limes are a wonderful way to engage in conversation and they have allowed him to share his grandfather’s story with local people and the development staff, who were more than intrigued to listen.</p>
      <p>Gordon said: “I visited The Limes a few times to see the road name dedicated to my grandfather and every trip was welcomed by the wonderful site staff who were interested in my family’s history and happy to be informed.</p>
      <h3>Thank</h3>
      <p>“It’s incredibly important to recognise these moments in our history, especially when remembering local figures who were once a vital part of our community.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank Barratt Homes for commemorating my grandfather in this special way, I know my mother would have been delighted to see her father’s name displayed proudly and represented as not just a memory, but a celebration of the life he lived.”</p>
      <p>Graydon Worthing, sales director at Barratt Homes West Midlands, said: “As a leading housebuilder, we ensure that the surrounding area’s heritage is a key part of all our developments.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted that we could recognise local war heroes in the area and even have relatives, such as Gordon, visit the site and see the dedication of our street names for themselves.”</p>
