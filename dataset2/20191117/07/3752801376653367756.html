      <h1>Jesse Hess' father: 'The only thing that will make me happy is if her killer is given a couple of life sentences'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T07:12:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 07:12</time> by <a rel="author">Tammy Petersen</a></address>
      <p>Jesse Hess was afraid of the relative who has since been identified as a person of interest in her murder, her paternal family has revealed.</p>
      <p>"She feared him," her aunt, Natasha Hess, said on Friday of the man who had spent most of Jesse's lifetime behind bars for raping a relative.</p>
      <p>The man has been linked to the case by circumstantial evidence, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/relative-identified-as-person-of-interest-in-murder-of-jesse-hess-and-her-grandfather-20191113">police confirmed</a> this past week, but has not yet been charged. </p>
      <p>He was arrested this week in a separate rape case after being on the run for two days.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the 31-year-old appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on rape and robbery charges following an alleged attack on a 16-year-old girl in Hanover Park on Monday. He did not apply for bail.</p>
      <p>Natasha said the man had been in jail since 2007 for raping a close relative. He was released on parole in December last year.</p>
      <p>Jesse, 19 and her grandfather, Chris Lategan, 85, were murdered in the family's Parow flat nine months later.</p>
      <p>Jesse's father, Lance, wore a pained expression as his wife, Audrey, recalled finding her stepdaughter naked and unresponsive in the one-bedroom unit she shared with her grandparents and aunt.</p>
      <p>Lance and Jesse's mother, Brenda who now lives in Florida, divorced when their only child was 3 years old. They shared custody of her until Brenda moved to the US and Jesse went to live with her grandmother, Cathy, and aunt Sandy two years ago.</p>
      <p>Lance had known the man, one of Jesse's maternal relatives, since he was just a child, never thinking the boy would grow up and one day be allegedly linked to the case involving his teenage daughter's rape and murder.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'He called me Uncle Lance'</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I saw him when he was a laaitie. He called me Uncle Lance," he said.</p>
      <p>They had rushed from their Parow Valley home to the flat on August 30 after Sandy had phoned to say that Jesse was not answering her phone, the couple recalled.</p>
      <p>There, residents told her that Lategan was lying unconscious on the bathroom floor.</p>
      <p>Neighbours had seen him through the window after Sandy, who had been at work, raised the alarm when she could not reach either Jesse or him that afternoon.</p>
      <p>Audrey, who is slight in stature and Lategan's granddaughter, gained access to the flat by breaking a glass panel on the front door.</p>
      <p>Besides a couch which had been moved, everything inside looked as it should, she explained.</p>
      <p>That was until she saw Lategan in the bathroom and Jesse naked on the bedroom floor.</p>
      <p>Her stepdaughter was blue in the face, Audrey recalled.</p>
      <p>"I just knew she was dead. I don't want to close my eyes sometimes because I can still see it."</p>
      <p>Jesse, a youth leader in the Church of Nazarene, had been preparing for a sermon she was scheduled to give to the youth in Bonteheuwel that night, Audrey said.</p>
      <p>"Her notebook and pencil had been lying on the floor with her earphones."</p>
      <p>The first-year theology student at the University of the Western Cape dreamed of one day <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/murdered-jesse-hess-dreamt-of-becoming-a-preacher-mourners-told-20190907">becoming a pastor</a>.</p>
      <p>Lance spoke proudly of his daughter's love for God. She had spent most of her time at church and never missed a service.</p>
      <p>Lance's brother, Richard, the family's spokesperson, said they had for the past three months mourned, fasted and prayed that the perpetrator would be found.</p>
      <p>"We made peace after we went for counselling."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Jesse had lived a full life'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Richard said he took comfort in the words of a church leader who told them that although she had died young, Jesse had "lived a full life because of how she had lived, through God".</p>
      <p>Lance said losing his daughter in such a violent manner had changed how he parented his youngest daughter, who is 9 years old.</p>
      <p>"I am so afraid for her. I love my children with everything I am. My girls are my everything."</p>
      <p>He smiled as he recalled how he had plaited little Jesse's hair during her weekend visits.</p>
      <p>Audrey, whom he had been dating at the time, pointed out her hair was a mess, but Lance had been proud he had styled his daughter's crown himself.</p>
      <p>"Now, she is in the place she is supposed to be, a better place," he said.</p>
      <p>"Jesse was borrowed to us. She had to go be with her heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>"But the way she died, the type of person she was… this is just wrong."</p>
      <p>Lance's youngest daughter said she missed "everything" about Jesse who had showed her how to apply make-up and braid her hair.</p>
      <p>Lance stared at the T-shirts his relatives were wearing. A collage of photos of a smiling Jesse was printed on the front.</p>
      <p>He said he had made his peace with the person who had killed his daughter.</p>
      <p>"I am not going to say I don't want to hit him, but that's not going to help me, or my family.</p>
      <p>"The only thing that will make me happy is if the perpetrator is given a couple of life sentences."</p>
