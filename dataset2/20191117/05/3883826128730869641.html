        <figcaption>The Mail on Sunday focuses on some of the reaction from viewers, many of whom it says were shocked by Prince Andrew's apparent "total lack of empathy" for Epstein's victims. The newspaper says the prince was "humiliated" in the "disastrous" TV interview. The duke "looked deeply uncomfortable" during the grilling, the paper adds.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sunday Mirror's headline refers to part of Prince Andrew's interview where he was asked about Virginia Giuffre's description of dancing with the prince, saying he sweated profusely and she went on to have a bath. The duke - the Queen's third child - said he "couldn't sweat" at that time because of a medical condition.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sunday Express carries a large picture of Prince Andrew on its front page, alongside the main points from the interview, which it calls "amazing". But the paper's main story is on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's nationalisation plans which the paper reports could pose a risk to millions of private pensions.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sunday Telegraph also carries a picture of Prince Andrew, but its main story is on the election. It has interviewed Boris Johnson - his first newspaper interview of the campaign - who has claimed that every Conservative parliamentary candidate has personally pledged to back his Brexit deal in the Commons. The paper says the "highly unusual decision" is designed to help convince Leave supporters that the Tories will deliver Brexit.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Sunday's Daily Star leads with the forecast of more rain from the Met Office, warning of "flood chaos" over the festive period. The weather experts have told emergency services and councils to prepare for more rain than normal over the coming months, the paper says.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sunday People leads with an interview with a woman who says she was attacked by a serial rapist who had previously been imprisoned in his home country of Romania for two almost identical rapes, the paper says, before he came into Britain.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Sunday Times's top story is on a year-long investigation, carried out with BBC Panorama, which found military commanders have been accused of covering up evidence of British soldiers' involvement in war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Ministry of Defence said extensive investigations into allegations had been carried out, and no decision had been taken to prosecute any of the cases. Meanwhile, the paper has seen a leak of the parliamentary report into Russian interference, which found meddling by Russia may have had an impact on the Brexit referendum but the effect was "unquantifiable".</figcaption>

        <b>"Disastrous". That's <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693929/Friend-sex-accuser-Virginia-Roberts-hits-Prince-Andrew-total-lack-empathy.html">the Mail on Sunday's verdict</a> on Prince Andrew's TV interview, which makes the front of several of the Sunday newspapers after airing on Saturday evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The paper attacks him for not showing any sympathy for Jeffrey Epstein's victims. "Not one single word of remorse" is its front page headline.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-denies-having-sex-20897365">The Sunday Mirror says</a> that any reasonable person would be ashamed of being friends with the billionaire sex offender.</p>
      <p>But, according to the paper, the Duke of York spent more time dwelling on the misery the scandal had caused him.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/prince-andrews-pr-man-quit-after-advising-against-interview-gvc59hmql">The Sunday Times reports</a> that one palace source described the interview as "one of the single worst PR moves in recent history".</p>
      <p>The duke's spin doctor is said to have left his job two weeks ago after advising Prince Andrew not to appear on Newsnight.</p>
      <p>The article also suggests that aides to the Queen and the Prince of Wales regarded the decision to go ahead with the interview with "incredulity and alarm".</p>
      <p>The Times's cartoonist, Newman, seizes on the duke's statement that he doesn't remember meeting 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre.</p>
      <p>His sketch pictures Prince Andrew in conversation with the Queen. She asks: "How was the Emily Maitlis interview?" to which the duke replies, "I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."</p>
      <h3>Russia report</h3>
      <p>Downing Street may not have released the parliamentary report on illicit Russian activities in the UK, but <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/revealed-the-russia-report-kz6c9mwxf">the Sunday Times says</a> it has some details.</p>
      <p>According to the paper, interference from Moscow may have had an impact on the Brexit referendum but the effect was unquantifiable.</p>
      <p>The report apparently highlights anti-EU articles which were disseminated on social media by Kremlin backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik.</p>
      <p>Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry tells the paper the disclosures raise serious questions about the safeguards in place for the general election.</p>

      <p>The battle by the main parties to control the election agenda is played out on the front pages.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/16/boris-johnson-every-tory-election-candidate-has-pledged-back/">The Sunday Telegraph leads</a> with an interview with Boris Johnson who reveals that every Conservative candidate has personally pledged to vote his Brexit deal through the Commons.</p>
      <p>The prime minister tells the paper that he wants people to be 100% sure that a Tory government would unblock Parliament.</p>
      <p>The Observer says that Labour is determined to put the future of the health service centre stage.</p>
      <p>To that end, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/16/nhs-us-pharma-donald-trump-selloff">Jeremy Corbyn has penned</a> an article for the paper where he pledges to pass an emergency NHS protection law should he win the election.</p>
      <p>The idea would be to stop American pharmaceutical companies from infiltrating the health service and forcing up the price of drugs.</p>
      <p>Labour's eye-catching spending pledges come in for some criticism in the comment pages.</p>
      <p>Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer says that despite offering "free stuff" for "absolutely everyone", the polls suggest Labour is still trailing.</p>
      <p>He believes this is due to "the old and usually reliable law of campaigns that it isn't enough to have popular policies. Commitments also have to be credible".</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-bring-back-free-dental-20896187">the Sunday Mirror praises</a> Labour's plans for free dental check-ups, arguing they'll save the NHS millions by stopping people with toothache ending up at GP surgeries.</p>

      <p>Several of the papers pick up on an interview given by the American businesswoman, Jennifer Arcuri, to ITV.</p>
      <p>There have been questions about her relationship with Boris Johnson while he was mayor of London - and whether she received favourable treatment; something he denies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693809/In-TV-interview-Jennifer-Arcuri-says-warned-Boris-Johnson-come-clean.html">According to the Mail on Sunday,</a> the prime minister now refuses to speak to her, leaving her feeling "disgusted and humiliated".</p>

      <p>Several papers carry news that MI5 wants to recruit working class spies.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Express says the intelligence agency is on the look-out for the offspring of motor mechanics, fitters and plumbers to join an 11-week scheme to tackle and investigate international terrorism.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mi5-recruit-working-class-spies-20896345">The Sunday Mirror quips</a> that James Bond prefers an Aston Martin, but candidates with Ford Fiestas will now do well. Its headline is "It's Bond... Jim Bond".</p>
      <p>Finally, should you feel tempted today to treat yourself to some chocolate or a coffee, then you might be interested in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693393/Chocolate-magazines-underwear-costing-144-000-lifetime.html">a Mail on Sunday article</a> which attempts to put a price tag on impulse buys.</p>
      <p>A study has found that - including things like books, beauty products and shoes - people make about 6,500 spur of the moment purchases during their life - and that in total they will cost £144,000.</p>
