      <p>Wales is home to plenty of monumentally wealthy people - many of whom have become household names.</p>
      <p>Familiar people top the rich lists every year, including Celtic Manor Resort owner and telecoms magnate Sir Terry Matthew, Admiral insurance founder Henry Engelhardt, and Iceland co-founder Sir Malcolm Walker.</p>
      <p>This year's Wales Rich List, published in the <a href="https://www.insidermedia.com/publications/wales-business-insider">latest edition of Wales Business Insider</a>, contains plenty of those recognisable faces, many of whom have had a huge impact on the economy and life in Wales.</p>
      <p>But the list also includes a number of people you might not have heard of, in spite of their wealth.</p>

      <p>Sir Terry Matthews remains Wales' only billionaire, with his wealth rising to £1.31bn from £1.24bn thanks to success at the Celtic Manor Resort and his other companies.</p>
      <p>But many of Wales' richest people are feeling the pinch, with 23 of the individuals and families who featured in this year's list experiencing a fall in the size of their fortunes.</p>
