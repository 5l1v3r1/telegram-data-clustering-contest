      <p>Tomas Berdych confirmed on Saturday at the ATP Finals in London that he was retiring 17 years after turning professional. The Czech world number 103 won 13 titles, reaching a career-high of fourth in the rankings in 2015. Berdych, 34, was a top-10 player from July 2010 until October 2016 but has struggled with a back injury over the past two seasons. He never won a Grand Slam title, coming closest at Wimbledon in 2010, where he beat Roger Federer and <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/atp-finals-roger-federer-outclasses-novak-djokovic-to-reach-semis-2132796">Novak Djokovic</a> before losing to Rafael Nadal in the final.</p>
      <p>Together with Radek Stepanek, he led the Czech Republic to Davis Cup wins in 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p>Berdych said he had decided to stop playing soon after this year's US Open.</p>
      <p>He said the highlight of his career was reaching the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/world-no-1-novak-djokovic-beats-roger-federer-7-6-5-1-6-7-6-4-4-6-13-12-3-to-win-wimbledon-2019-titl-2069494">Wimbledon final</a>.</p>
      <p>"I was in the finals in Wimbledon in 2010 beating Djokovic, Federer, before losing to Nadal," he said. "I won a Masters in Bercy (Paris). And two Davis Cups.</p>
      <p>"Maybe strange, but I would say the Wimbledon. Not the win -- not the victory at the end, but for me, still, like, very, very special moment. Even the final that I lost, it was very, very special moment."</p>
