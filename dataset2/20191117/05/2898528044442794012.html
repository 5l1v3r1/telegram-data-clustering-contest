      <h1>UFC São Paulo bonuses: James Krause, Randy Brown, Ricardo Ramos earn big, Charles Oliveira moves closer to history</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:00:21+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jose Youngs</a></address>
      <p>While UFC Sao Paulo lacked any real back-and-forth wars, it had no shortage of stoppages. The Brazilian crowd was treated to a myriad of bonus-worthy performances inside Ginásio do Ibirapuera at UFC Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>Headlining the string of performance bonuses was none other than <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/175/charles-oliveira">Charles Oliveira</a> (28-8, 1 NC), who pocketed an extra $50,000 for his first round knockout over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4060/jared-gordon">Jared Gordon</a> on the night’s main card. The stunning victory not only extended the hometown hero’s winning streak to six bouts (none of which have gone to the judges), but also marked his 15th stoppage win inside the Octagon. The 15 finishes also leave Oliveira one shy of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/58/donald-cerrone">Donald Cerrone</a>’s UFC record.</p>
      <p>Other fighters to take home bonuses include <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3516/randy-brown">Randy Brown</a>, James Kraus and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3981/ricardo-lucas-ramos">Ricardo Ramos</a>, all of which earned $50,000 of their own.</p>
      <p>Krause (22-7) disconnected <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1673/sergio-moraes">Sergio Moraes</a> from his senses late in the final of their preliminary scrap, earning his second career bonus in the process. Ramos (14-2), who was making his featherweight debut, walked away with an impressive first-round submission win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5016/luiz-eduardo-garagorri">Luiz Eduardo Garagorri</a>. The Brazilian previously had earned a bonus for his violent KO of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3949/aiemann-zahabi">Aiemann Zahabi</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>For Brown (12-3), who tapped Warrley Alves early in the second round, this marked his first performance bonus.</p>
      <p>There were several entertaining fights in Brazil, but no <i>Fight of the Night </i>bonus was awarded by the UFC.</p>
