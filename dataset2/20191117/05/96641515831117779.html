      <h1>BioWare may revamp 'Anthem' in a bid to save it</h1>
      <h2>It's not giving up on the shared world shooter.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:02:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>There's no question that BioWare has struggled with <i>Anthem</i> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-anthem-cataclysm-in-game-event-returns.html">between bugs</a> and basic mechanics, and has made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/18/bioware-hopes-to-fix-anthem-by-swapping-acts-for-seasonal-upda/">significant gameplay changes</a> in a bid to keep its shared world shooter alive. However, the developer might soon resort to more drastic measures. <i>Kotaku</i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415">sources</a> say BioWare and EA are readying a revamp of the <i>Destiny</i>-like game nicknamed "Anthem 2.0" or "Anthem Next." The rethink will "drastically" change basics like mission design, looting and even the world itself. The team spent a few months simply "tearing [<i>Anthem</i>] down" and spent more months rebuilding the title, one tipster said.</p>
      <p>Just how you'd get this rework isn't certain. The team is reportedly exploring a number of options, including releasing updates over time, an all-at-once release or even treating it as a brand new game. If there is a full-fledged re-release, though, you probably won't have to pay full price.</p>
      <p>EA has declined to comment. This would be an unusual strategy for the publisher, though. It has a reputation for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/19/mass-effect-andromeda-wont-get-single-player-dlc/">cutting its losses</a> when a studio's game doesn't pan out, in some cases <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/17/ea-shuts-down-visceral-games/">shutting down the studio</a> altogether. This would be a vote of confidence in BioWare's ability to turn <i>Anthem</i> around make it match the hype -- or at least, give <i>Destiny</i> players something they'd enjoy in between seasonal events.</p>
