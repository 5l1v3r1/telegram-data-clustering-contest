      <h1>UK weather: Polar vortex brings cold snap as temperatures plunge to -2C</h1>
      <h2>Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>A 'collapsed polar vortex' is predicted to bring 'severe' <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> for Europe as parts of the UK  are hit by subzero temperatures.</p>
      <p>Frosty nights are in store in the coming days as the mercury plummets to the single digits across much of the UK.</p>
      <p>This week saw snow fall in Bristol on Thursday morning, however the white stuff didn't settle and temperatures then rose to a seasonably warm 8C.</p>
      <p>Now, meteoreologists are warning "severe" conditions are in store for the continent after snowstorms ravaged southeast France - and this will have a knock-on effect in Britain.</p>
      <p>Nowhere in the UK will be spared today's (Sunday) chill, with forecasters predicting the mercury will drop to the single-digit highs across the country.</p>
      <p>And frosty temperatures as low as -2C are set to grip central areas of central Scotland early on Monday morning, with lows of -1C for Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Central Scotland and the Highlands will be dealt temperatures sitting around -1C to -2C overnight Tuesday too, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-forecast-polar-vortex-20895595">the Mirror.</a></p>

      <p>Meteorologist Andrej Flis told the  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1205297/bbc-weather-europe-warning-polar-vortex-snow-winter-floods-snowstorm">Express</a>: “The weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex is well underway.</p>
      <p>“In the past days, the polar vortex reached 40-year record strength for this time of year. It would likely strengthen even further, but its rise to power was stopped and reversed, due to two pressure/temperature waves that press onto the vortex.</p>
      <p>“That reduces the speed of the stratospheric polar jet stream.</p>
      <p>“That is a strong sign of a collapsed polar vortex, and high probability of a sudden stratospheric warming event by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“What all this means for our weather? Well, a collapsed vortex always greatly increases the chances for winter weather towards Europe.”</p>
