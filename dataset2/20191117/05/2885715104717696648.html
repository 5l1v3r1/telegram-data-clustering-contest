      <h1>Character Spotlight: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani’s Naina Talwar</h1>
      <h2>In the tenth edition of the series 'Character Spotlight', I revisit the character Naina Talwar, played by Deepika Padukone, in Ayan Mukerji's hit film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013).</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:51:57+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/mimansa-shekhar/" target="_blank">Mimansa Shekhar</a></address>
      <p>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani’s Naina Talwar is one of the most relatable characters <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/deepika-padukone/">Deepika Padukone</a> has essayed so far. But what made Naina such a relatable character?</p>
      <p>Naina is introduced to us as an awkward girl who has always held herself back. She is a ticking bomb ready to explode out of her self-inflicted bondage.</p>
      <p>However, the geeky Naina Talwar turns into a free-spirited Naina by the end of her Manali escapade, and we can’t help but relate to the true independence she feels. Her life has changed. She, like many of us, has befriended the girl inside her who was rearing to reveal herself all this while. Naina connected with every girl sitting in the audience.</p>
      <p>Naina had one of the most striking character graphs in the film. From ‘Scholar Naina’, she turned into the confident Doctor Naina Talwar who shed her inhibitions coming into her own self, inspiring every girl to find her wings. From aspiring to be cool like her friends to beating them in a race and singing Bachchan songs, she is, as Bunny puts it, “full Hindi film hero”. Even director Ayan Mukerji had called her “the yang to Bunny’s yin”.</p>

        <figcaption>One of the high points of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is the chemistry between <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ranbir-kapoor/">Ranbir Kapoor</a>’s Bunny and Deepika Padukone’s Naina.</figcaption>

      <p>Naina Talwar also gave life lessons. She taught us to live every moment. “Jitna bhi try kar lo life mein kuch na kuch chootega hi. Toh jahan ho wahin ka maza lete hain” (As much as you try, you’ll miss out on something in life. So it’s better to enjoy the moment you are living) and “Thoda waqt do sab theek ho jayega” (Give it sometime, everything will get better) showcase her wise and optimistic side.</p>
