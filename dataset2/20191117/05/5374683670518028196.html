      <h2>Ismail Haniyeh pays condolence visit to family of Islamic Jihad leader eliminated by Israel: Our partnership cannot be dismantled.</h2>

      <p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Saturday paid a condolence visit to the family of Islamic Jihad leader Baha Abu al-Ata <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271500">who was eliminated</a> by Israel on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“We will not compromise the blood of our martyrs and leaders,” Haniyeh said during the visit, according to <i>Yediot Aharonot</i>.</p>
      <p>“We have a partnership which cannot be dismantled. This round of fighting is not the last, and the score with the enemy is not settled," he declared.</p>
      <p>Haniyeh’s visit comes a day after Hamas officials who paid a condolence call to Abu al-Ata’s family were turned away using violence. The incident was meant to send a message to the Hamas officials that they were not welcome due to the fact that <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271716">they did not take part</a> in the last round of escalation.</p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad responded to the Abu al-Ata’s elimination by firing <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271632">hundreds of rockets</a> at Israeli civilians before <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271643">agreeing to a ceasefire</a>.</p>
      <p>Overnight Friday, the Hamas terror group <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271739">fired two rockets at Be'er Sheva</a>. In response, IDF fighter jets and aircraft struck a number of Hamas terror targets in Gaza.</p>
