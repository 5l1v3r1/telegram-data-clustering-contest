      <p>Following up on 2018's "Excuse Me" track, Ro James has returned to deliver on a smooth new cut in the form of "Last Time."</p>
      <p>The smooth new cut offers a sample of <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Usher/profile">Usher</a>'s "Can Uh Handle It?" and offers a directive in expressing appreciation for a special lady.</p>
      <p>"'Last Time' will be the first song I release from the new body of work," James previously expressed. "These last 2 years I’ve been recording a million songs...Something I learned: even [though] we all busy, the hustle is real. As men, we can forget to treat our Queens like she’s a priority while tryna accomplish our goals. Because someone else will."</p>

          <b>Quotable Lyrics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Tell me, when's the last time<br/>He noticed all your efforts<br/>Told you that you lookin' good today, baby<br/>Tell me, when's the last time<br/>He told you that he wants you<br/>And he's happy that he made you his lady</p>
