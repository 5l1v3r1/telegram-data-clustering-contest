      <p>James Harden has scored 49 points on a whopping 41 shots from the field as Houston made it seven wins in a row with a 125-105 victory at Minnesota.</p>
      <p>With Russell Westbrook resting and a number of other key personnel out injured, the Rockets needed Harden to shoulder an even bigger scoring load than usual.</p>

      <p>Harden made 16 of the 41 shots, going eight for 22 from three-point range. He was nine of 11 on free throws.</p>
      <p>Ben McLemore scored 20 points while undrafted rookie Chris Clemons and Austin Rivers both chalked up 19.</p>

      <p>Brook Lopez added 15 points, eight rebounds and five blocked shots for the 9-3 Bucks as the Pacers shot a season-low 32 per cent from the field against the</p>
      <p>Kendrick Nunn scored 22 points to lead Miami Heat to a 109-94 win over New Orleans to remain unbeaten at home.</p>
      <p>Bam Adebayo had 18 points and 14 rebounds while Jimmy Butler added 16 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds as Miami improved to 5-0 at home and 9-3 overall â€“ equalling their best 12-game start in team history.</p>
      <p>Luka Doncic had 26 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists in Dallas' 110-102 win over NBA champions Toronto.</p>
      <p>CJ McCollum scored 32 points as the Portland Trail Blazers saw off the San Antonio Spurs 121-116 to spoil Tim Duncan's first shot at coaching after Gregg Popovich's ejection early in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Spencer Dinwiddie top scored with 24 points as Brooklyn accounted for the Bulls 117-111 without All-Star guard Kyrie Irving (shoulder) to snap a three-game losing streak.</p>

      <p>In more bad injury news for the Golden State Warriors, their leading scorer Russell will miss at least two weeks of the NBA season with a sprained right thumb.</p>
      <p>The team announced his status after reviewing results of an MRI on Saturday.</p>

        <figcaption>D'Angelo Russell has joined Golden State's extensive injury list.<cite>Getty Images</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He will be re-evaluated in two weeks and will not join the Warriors on their four-game road trip.</p>
      <p>Russell, 23, left Friday night's 105-100 home loss to the Boston Celtics midway through the third quarter after having the ball swiped away by Daniel Theis during a drive to the basket.</p>
      <p>He missed the game's final 18 minutes.</p>
      <p>The All-Star had his hand checked on the sideline, then went to the locker room and didn't return.</p>
      <p>Russell, who is averaging 24.3 points and 6.7 assists, finished the game with 12 points, seven assists and nine turnovers.</p>
      <p>The injury is the latest setback for the 2-11 Warriors, who also are without stars Stephen Curry (broken hand) and Klay Thompson (torn ACL, season).</p>
      <p>Kevon Looney, Jacob Evans and rookie Alen Smailagic also have missed all or most of the season thus far.</p>
      <p>The Warriors face the New Orleans Pelicans (3-8) on the road on Sunday.</p>
