      <p>The Duke of York has said he could not have had sex with the teenager, Virginia Giuffre, because on the night in question he  took his daughter Beatrice to a party at Pizza Express in Woking, and then spent the night at home with his children. He said: 'Going to  Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very weird thing for me to do.' Prince Andrew also said that Giuffre's assertion that he sweated heavily when dancing with her was untrue because, due to a medical condition at the time, it was almost impossible for him to sweat</p>
