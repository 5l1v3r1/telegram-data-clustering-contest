      <p>The opposition Barisan Nasional defeated the ruling Pakatan Harapan in a by-election in Johor, wrestling the parliamentary seat with a 15,000 majority.</p>
      <p>The BN rep Wee Jeck Seng registered a whopping 25,466 votes to the PH’s candidate Karmaine Sardini’s 10,380 votes. PH won the seat last year but the incumbent MP succumbed to a heart attack last month.</p>
      <p>The Tanjung Piai by-election is seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s leadership, said a former deputy president of Anwar Ibrahim’s party, Syed Husin Ali.</p>
      <p>Anwar heads the PKR which stands for People’s Justice Party in English. The seat was contested by a member of Dr Mahathir’s party, the Bersatu.</p>

      <p>Syed Husin Ali says the message is loud and clear and Dr M should step down because he has to take responsibility for the severe defeat.</p>
      <p>“The results are clear. The people are disappointed and want to teach Harapan, especially Dr M (a lesson),” he tweeted after it became clear BN was headed for a landslide victory.</p>
      <p>“He (Mahathir) knows what should be done with immediate effect. Don’t delay it any longer.</p>
      <p>“A large number of the rakyat (people) are unhappy with Mahathir’s leadership which has slid to his and Umno’s old ways.”</p>
      <p>He said the people expected changes but they are slow in coming and the people spoke at Tanjung Piai.</p>
      <p>Tanjung Piai is one of the rare time Dr Mahathir campaigned personally in favour of PH candidate Karmaine.</p>
      <p>The latter is a Muslim religious figure, and he was defeated by a Chinese from the Malaysian Chinese Association in a shift of votes in the constituency.</p>
      <p>The irony is the Barisan candidate got the backing of the Islamists from the PAS who last year canvassed Muslim voters not to vote for non-Muslims in an election.</p>
      <p>This time around, they said it was the duty of the Muslims to punish the PH and vote for an ethnic Chinese instead.</p>
      <p>On top of that, ex-PM Najib Razak was also hot on the trails in the campaign supporting the BN candidate.</p>
