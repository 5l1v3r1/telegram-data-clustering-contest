      <p>The legend of <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/jofra-archer-speaks-on-racism-in-sports-says-world-is-changing-becoming-more-multicultural-2130844">Jofra Archer</a> goes far beyond the cricketing field. The England speedster almost has godly status on social media platforms, especially Twitter. In the past, the 24-year-old's cryptic tweets have gone viral with many fans jokingly crediting the pacer for making <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/jofra-archers-2015-prediction-on-prithvi-shaw-suspension-leaves-twitter-amazed-2078290">freaky but accurate predictions</a>. However, on Sunday, there was no such tweet from Jofra Archer but rather a straightforward post where he asked fans to suggest some questions that they would want answered in his "Q&amp;A video for YouTube". But even with his fortune-telling skills, the fast bowler would not have guessed the sort of strange questions that came his way -- some of them bordering on the crazy.</p>
      <p>"Hey guys need some questions for my upcoming Q&amp;A video for YouTube, reply with some questions you'd like to see me answer," wrote Archer on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Soon enough, the comments section was flooded with questions. While some of them were genuine ones but a few others were just plain bizarre.</p>
      <p>"Why do pizzas come in square boxes Jof?," asked one fan while another wanted to know "Will there ever be a boy born who can swim faster than a shark?".</p>
      <p>"Favourite singer? Dhinchak pooja OR Ranu mondal?," asked an Indian fan.</p>
      <p>Here is our pick of some of the most strange questions posed to Jofra Archer:</p>

      <p>The Barbados-born bowler has quickly become a favourite with the England fans since he became eligible to play for his adopted country earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Sussex star benefited from the England and Wales Cricket Board reducing the eligibility period from seven years to three so he did not have to wait till 2022.</p>
      <p>He quickly showed his worth by bowling the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/jofra-archer-reveals-ben-stokes-words-of-encouragement-before-super-over-in-world-cup-final-2069943">decisive Super Over in the thrilling World Cup final win</a> over New Zealand.</p>
      <p>He then marked his test debut by <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/jofra-archer-smirks-after-injuring-steve-smith-with-nasty-bouncer-twitter-fumes-2086528">flooring Australia's star batsman Steve Smith</a> in the second Ashes Test at Lord's which saw him miss the following match at Headingley with concussion and in his absence England won to level the series.</p>
      <p>Archer will be next seen in action when England face New Zealand at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui in the first game of the two-match Test series starting on November 21.</p>
