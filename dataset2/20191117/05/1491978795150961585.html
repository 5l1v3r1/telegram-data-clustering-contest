        <i>At least six deaths have been linked to the outbreak, in a nation where vaccination rates are alarmingly low</i>
      </p>
      <p>Samoa has closed all schools and cracked down on public gatherings as it enters a state of emergency over the deadly measles outbreak spreading across the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pacific-islands">Pacific islands</a>.</p>
      <p>The island state of just 200,000, halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, announced the state of emergency on Saturday after declaring a measles epidemic late in October, when the first deaths were reported.</p>
      <p>Since then, at least six deaths, mostly infants under the age of two, have been linked to the outbreak, the health ministry said in a statement late last week. Of the 716 suspected cases of measles, 40% required hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>As of the weekend, it would be a “mandatory legal requirement” for unvaccinated citizens to receive an immunisation injection, the government said in a statement. Only about two-thirds of the population has been immunised, according to the health ministry.</p>
      <p>In the statement, Samoa’s director general of health, Leausa Take Naseri, said: “The way it is going now and the poor (immunisation) coverage, we are anticipating the worst to come.”</p>
      <p>He added that the children who have died had not been vaccinated.</p>
      <p>New Zealand’s foreign minister, Winston Peters, said on Friday that his country would send 3,000 vaccines and 12 nurses to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/samoa">Samoa</a> to assist with the outbreak.</p>
      <p>“Measles is highly contagious, and the outbreak has taken lives in Samoa,” Peters said. “It is in everybody’s interests that we work together to stop its spread.”</p>
      <p>Measles cases are rising globally, including in wealthy nations such as the US and Germany, where some parents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/16/vaccines-measles-mumps-polio-hepatitis-b">shun immunisation</a> mostly for philosophical or religious reasons, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/31/vaxxed-2-movie-sequel-release-fears-propaganda">concerns, debunked by medical science, that such vaccines could cause autism</a>.</p>
      <p>In Tonga, about 900km from Samoa, the ministry of health last week said an outbreak of measles in the country occurred following the return of a squad of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Since then, 251 cases of confirmed or suspected measles have been identified, the ministry said.</p>
      <p>American Samoa, a US territory neighbouring Samoa, declared a public health emergency on Thursday following the measles outbreak in Samoa and Tonga, according to New Zealand media.</p>
      <p>According to Naseri, about 90% of the population in Tonga and American Samoa have been immunised, and neither of these countries have reported any measles-related deaths.</p>
