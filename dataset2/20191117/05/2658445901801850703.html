      <p>Only a few people know that Lai Mohammed has a daughter who is doing well in the fashion industry and she prefers to keep it that way.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Information’s daughter, Yeside Laguda, was one of the designers who showcased beautiful pieces at the just concluded GTBank Fashion Weekend.</p>
      <p>When Mohammad stormed the venue of the event, Laguda maintained a distance. There was no hint that the creative director of MyQ Lifestyle Concepts is someone special to the politician. When her father was leaving too, she was not all over him.</p>
      <p>Social Circuit learnt that she had worked seriously to maintain a low-profile as regards her family background. She likes to be called a designer, rather down Lai Mohammad’s daughter.</p>
