      <h1>Exclusive: John Barnes discusses Liverpool FC’s January transfer plans</h1>
      <h2>John Barnes has his say on Liverpool FC's plans for the January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>John Barnes is not expecting Liverpool FC to be active in the January transfer window – unless a player who can come straight into the first team becomes available.</h3>
      <p>The Reds have made an incredible start to the new Premier League season and they currently find themselves top of the table and eight points clear.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s men have only dropped points on one occasion this season, during a 1-1 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford last month, and the Reds have won the other 11 games in the top flight this term.</p>
      <p>Attentions will now start to gradually turn towards the January transfer window and the chance to potentially add some players to their squad in the new year.</p>
      <p>However, England legend Barnes does not seem to think that Klopp’s side will be particularly active in January given the strength of the squad as things stand.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he is expecting Liverpool FC to do much business in January, Barnes told <a href="https://www.thesportreview.com/2019/11/liverpool-fc-news-john-barnes-chelsea-fc-alexander-arnold-exclusive/">The Sport Review</a>: “No, because I think we’ve got a squad that’s strong enough.</p>
      <p>“Unless there’s a player who’s going to come into the first team, to replace someone in the first team and make us stronger, why buy a player just to be in the squad when we’ve got lots of squad players?</p>
      <p>“So I don’t necessarily think that we’re going to be that active in the January transfer window. Particularly as Liverpool are not a team like Man City who will look to cover every position with an international player.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will return to Premier League action after the international break with a trip to Crystal Palace in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s side were impressive 3-1 winners over Manchester City in their most recent top-flight outing at Anfield.</p>
