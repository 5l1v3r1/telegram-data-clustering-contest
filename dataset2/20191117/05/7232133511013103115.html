      <h3>Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis (BTC)</h3>
      <p>This past week, bitcoin saw an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/bitcoin-btc-recovering-but-is-this-real-correction/">increase in selling pressure</a> below the $8,880 support area against the US Dollar. Moreover, BTC price settled below the $8,700 pivot level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
      <p>There were steady losses and the price broke the $8,600 and $8,500 support levels. A new monthly low is formed near $8,382 and the price is clearly trading in a bearish zone.</p>
      <p>It is currently consolidating losses above the $8,400 level. Besides, bitcoin is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,777 high to $8,382 low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, there are many resistances near $8,580 and $8,600. There is also a declining channel forming with resistance near $8,580 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,777 high to $8,382 low is also near the $8,580 level.</p>
      <p>If there is an upside break above the channel resistance, the price could test the $8,620 and $8,630 resistance levels. More importantly, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,630 on the same chart.</p>
      <p>To move into a positive zone, the price must break the $8,700 and $8,720 levels. Having said that, a proper close above the $8,880 resistance is needed for a trend change and a fresh increase.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/bitcoin-btc-in-slow-and-steady-decline-8-2k-likely-target/">many key supports near the $8,320 and $8,200 levels</a>. The bears are likely to face a strong buying interest near $8,200, below which there is a risk of a break down towards the $8,000 handle.</p>
