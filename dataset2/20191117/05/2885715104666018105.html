      <p>A DIGITAL CLASSROOM with a wide reach and advanced innovation, PaperVideo, a computerised classroom for supplementary learning, has launched its math educational programmes for classes VIII to XII, across CBSE, ICSE, HSC, SSC and all state education boards of India.</p>
      <p>PaperVideo claims to be India’s first digital classroom, which helps in solving all mathematics problems.</p>
      <p>PaperVideo’s teacher-led “live” classes and digital books are free of cost.</p>
      <p>The founders of the digital classroom believe that the Indian education system has seen a number of changes since its inception and has changed with the times and society. But the country needed to grow more in the field of providing qualitative and quantitative learning.</p>
      <p>Chirag Arya, founder, PaperVideo, said, “ We have historically noticed that a lot of students are weak in mathematics and find it difficult to fix it for months. Coming from a family which is into education for years, I have realised that math is fundamental to all the subjects and PaperVideo aims to bridge the gap and bring academic resources to those who need it. PaperVideo is being introduced in many institutes and we are seeing a good response from students as well.”</p>
      <p>The educational module is based on a structured and time-tested learning strategy, which makes a difference for students to realise their potential.</p>
      <p>PaperVideo’s ‘Skill Engine’ tracks each student’s advance all through their learning. Each course, homework or test outlines the student’s qualities and shortcomings and provides customised learning ways, classes, and tests for each understudy.</p>
      <p>eDigital books offer students a chance to envision each concept, making it simpler to understand it and also follow difficult concepts with the help of computerised books, video addresses, test questions and a lot more to make the subject interesting for its students.</p>
