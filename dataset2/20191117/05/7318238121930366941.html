      <h1>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards wins re-election in blow to Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:06:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:06</time> by <a rel="author">Lauren Egan </a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is projected to narrowly win a second term as Louisiana governor, beating Republican challenger Eddie Rispone by 1.4 percentage points and delivering another blow in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elections-kentucky-mississippi-test-trump-s-political-power-n1075581">off-cycle elections</a> to President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Edwards was up by over 19,000 votes with 96% of precincts reporting Saturday night, according to the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>Edwards' victory in a state that Trump carried in 2016 by nearly 20 percentage points highlights the limitations of nationalizing local races. Rispone, a wealthy businessman and long-time Republican donor, tied himself to Trump. He often railed against illegal immigrants on the campaign trail and portrayed Edwards as a "liberal, socialist-leaning governor."</p>
      <p>But Edwards, a conservative Democrat, managed to remain fairly popular by frequently breaking with national Democrats. He signed into law one of the most <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/democrats-fight-abortion-opponents-including-those-inside-party-n1012766">restrictive abortion bills</a> in the country, favored gun rights, and touted his willingness to work with Republicans, including Trump.</p>
      <p>Edwards also earned a level of good will in his first term for his focus on local issues, such as ending the <a href="https://apnews.com/bf7e63de42494d5bb867bd851112d4b7">budget crisis</a> created by his predecessor and <a href="https://apnews.com/609ae88f835a46a68f36908480fa835d">expanding Medicaid</a>.</p>
      <p>Louisiana is the second reliably red state that voted for Trump to elect a Democrat as governor in the past month. Kentucky elected Attorney General <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elections-kentucky-mississippi-test-trump-s-political-power-n1075581">Andy Beshear</a> over GOP incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin, despite Trump's campaign efforts in the state.</p>
      <p>Edwards was a top target for the GOP as the Republican National Committee spent $2 million to defeat him and Trump visited the state three times in five weeks to support Rispone.</p>
      <p>Before the polls closed Saturday, Trump tweeted multiple times encouraging voters to support Rispone.</p>

      <p>Edwards narrowly missed the 50 percent threshold needed for an outright win in the October <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/incumbent-governor-democrat-faces-runoff-trump-territory-n1065461">jungle primary</a>, in which every candidate runs against each other on the same ballot regardless of party. He earned 46 percent of the vote, Rispone 27 percent and Rep. Ralph Abraham, R-La., roughly 23 percent.</p>
      <p>Although Abraham endorsed and campaigned for Rispone in the runoff, it was not enough to push the Republican over the finish line.</p>
      <p>Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, was elected in 2015 in what many viewed as a fluke election due to a flawed <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnstanton/prostitution-scandal-finally-costs-david-vitter-an-election">Republican opponent</a> mired in a prostitution scandal.</p>
