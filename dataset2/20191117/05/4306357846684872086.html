      <h3>Liverpool FC have got a “new player” on their hands in the shape of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, according to Ally McCoist.</h3>
      <p>The Liverpool FC midfielder has been working his way back to full fitness after having missed most of last season due to a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in England’s 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro on Thursday night and earned lots of praise for his solid performance for Gareth Southgate’s men.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has now scored five goals for club and country this season and he will be hoping to hold down a more regular spot in the first team in the coming weeks and months at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain has only started two of Liverpool FC’s 12 Premier League games this term but he has made a further six appearances from the bench for Jurgen Klopp’s men.</p>
      <p>Former Scotland international McCoist was very impressed by Oxlade-Chamberlain’s performance on Thursday night and he is tipping him to be in good form for club and country in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>talkSPORT</i>, McCoist said: “It’s like a new player. Effectively, it’s like Liverpool and England have got a new player.</p>
      <p>“Clearly he looks as though, the best way to put it would be he wants to make up for lost time.</p>
      <p>“The injury has obviously been a real blow to him but clearly he’s over it and he only wants to go one way.</p>
      <p>“I thought his goal was excellent, what a great touch, everything about it.</p>
      <p>“The touch set it up for the strike, the strike into the goalkeeper’s bottom right-hand corner – I just thought it was brilliant.</p>
      <p>“I just think the best way to put it would be it looks as though Liverpool and England have got themselves a new player, a fresh player, a hungry player and make no mistake about it, an extremely talented one.</p>
      <p>“I’ve not met the guy but I love him. He just looks a nice, nice likeable guy.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will return to Premier League action after the international break when they take on Crystal Palace away from home.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s men are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table as they chase the title this term.</p>
