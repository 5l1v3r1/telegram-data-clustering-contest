      <h1>Knockout! Watch Jason Knight end Artem Lobov in one-sided rematch at Bare Knuckle FC 9</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T05:38:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 05:38</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Jason Knight got the revenge he was looking for last night (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at Bare Knuckle FC 9 live on <a href="https://www.bareknuckle.tv/orderppv">FITE.TV PPV</a> from Biloxi, Mississippi, when he battered fellow UFC veteran Artem Lobov in their main event rematch en route to claiming a bloody fifth-round knockout finish.</p>
      <p>From the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/7/18299034/post-fight-pictures-lobov-knight-bare-knuckle-fc-5-brutal-cuts-lacerations">looks of the first fight</a> you would think both fighters were going to land shots in last night’s rematch, but that simply wasn’t the case. Knight was able to tighten up his punches, lean on his precision, and utilize his range to put “Russian Hammer” out of service.</p>
      <p>Knight’s efforts paid off throughout the fight as Conor McGregor’s main man suffered cuts to his face and a knockdown in the second, but Lobov kept plodding forward. That was until Knight landed a final left hand to Lobov’s eye in the fifth round and forced the Russian to fall to the canvas in pain.</p>
