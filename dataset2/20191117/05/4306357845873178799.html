      <h3>Jordan Henderson has revealed that he spoke to Jurgen Klopp about being used in a different role in the Liverpool FC team earlier this year.</h3>
      <p>The England international lifted the Champions League trophy last season after he started Liverpool FC’s 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid.</p>
      <p>Henderson was part of the Reds side that were 4-0 winners against FC Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final.</p>
      <p>However, the Liverpool FC skipper had been left frustrated a week earlier when he was omitted from Klopp’s starting XI at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Fabinho’s arrival in a £40m deal from AS Monaco in the 2018 summer transfer window provided Henderson with increased competition in the no6 role.</p>
      <p>By the second half of the 2018-19 season, the Brazil international became first-choice in that position to leave Henderson with a battle for a starting spot.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Liverpool FC legend Jamie Carragher in the <i>Sky Sports</i> pundit’s new podcast <i>The Greatest Game</i>, Henderson opened up about a key conversation with Klopp ahead of the second leg back in May.</p>
      <p>“Listen, when I’m not playing I’m not great, and I find it really difficult,” Henderson said.</p>
      <p>“I always respect the players around me and know how good the other players are, and it’s not a case of ‘I should be starting’, it’s more of a ‘what can I do to get in the team?’ and ‘what do I need to be doing better?’.</p>
      <p>“And at that time I’d played a position where I needed to play, because obviously we didn’t really have that type of player.</p>
      <p>“I learned a role that was needed, and I felt as though I learned that role really well, and the gaffer helped me do that role so well.</p>
      <p>“When Fab came in—and in the sort of December time he started really taking on that role really well, and it was more of his natural position and for me he’s so good in that position—after that period I started thinking ‘maybe now I can show what I feel as though is more natural to me’.</p>
      <p>“So it was around that time I had a conversation with the manager about maybe playing a little bit further forward in the No. 8.</p>
      <p>“It was more natural, I played there for England as well.”</p>
      <p>Henderson moved to Liverpool FC in a £20m deal from Sunderland in the 2011 summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Reds are sitting eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC in the Premier League table.</p>
