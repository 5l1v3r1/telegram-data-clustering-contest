      <h1>'Fistfuls of money and empty drug bags': festival MDMA dealers sentenced</h1>

      <p>It was the sweat that alerted police to the three men.</p>
      <p>Christopher Lin, a 21-year-old engineering student from Beverly Hills, had left the Midnight Mafia dance festival at 10pm and was standing outside the gates when police noticed how sweaty he was, despite the cool May evening.</p>

      <p>Lin, who court documents say was "well known" to police as an MDMA dealer in Sydney's dance festival scene, also seemed "extremely nervous".</p>
      <p>When police searched him they found $10,020 stashed between his pockets and his Louis Vuitton carry-all.</p>
      <p>Lin's school friend Brendon Phommaly, a personal trainer who was on bail for other drug-related offences at the time, was also arrested at the festival.</p>

      <p>Given the "fistfuls of money and empty drug bags" with which Phommaly was found, there "certainly seems to be material there from which the court can see the money that you had is the proceeds of drug transactions involving Mr Lin," magistrate Danny Reiss said.</p>
      <p>Phommaly pleaded guilty to one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime and was sentenced to a one-year in-community sentence and a $1000 fine in Burwood Local Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Police also arrested Mohammad Popal, a TAB betting manager who had agreed to take drugs into the festival for a profit because he was having trouble paying his electricity bill, at his home some nine days after Midnight Mafia and charged him with two counts of supplying MDMA and one of participating in a criminal group.</p>
      <p>He had met Lin and other friends at Olympic Park's Quest Hotel, and after some persuading from Lin, agreed to take a vial containing 40 MDMA pills into the festival in his pocket, the court heard.</p>
      <p>He walked past the sniffer dogs without incident, then entered a portaloo.</p>
      <p>Two of Lin's charges were dropped, and on Friday he was sentenced to a year-long community corrections order and a $1000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of supplying a prohibited drug.</p>
      <p>The court heard he told police he had 40 capsules in his pocket.</p>
      <p>Popal was "the drug courier and did receive a financial benefit at a time in which there was media coverage every second day of young people dying" at music festivals, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Lin will return to court on December 16 and will be sentenced on one charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime and one of supplying 200 MDMA pills. He has entered a guilty plea to the charge.</p>
      <p>Six attendees at the Midnight Mafia festival overdosed, none fatally.</p>
      <p>The sentences come a week after Deputy State Coroner Harriet Grahame formally handed down her recommendations following an inquest into festival deaths, which included the introduction of pill testing facilities, the decriminalisation of small amounts of drugs for personal use, and the scrapping of so-called "high visibility" policing including the use of drug dogs and strip searches.</p>
