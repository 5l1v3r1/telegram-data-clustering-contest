      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI:</b> There has been a surge in child trafficking in the State and till date, 17 such cases have been registered. So far, Assam ranks the highest among the Northeastern states for various crimes against children.</p>
      <p>As per reports, till November 10, 2019, a total of 125 cases have been registered in the State this year of crimes against children. 13 of such cases are against violation of child rights, 5 cases against child labour, 43 cases against child sexual abuse, 5 cases against child marriage, 24 cases of child in need of care and affection, 13 cases against RTE (Right to Education) violation cases.</p>
      <p>According to Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (ASCPCR), 11 cases of child trafficking were registered in 2018, while this year, 17 such cases have been registered.</p>
      <p>As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 4951 out of 129032 cases of crime against children were registered in Assam. The State shares 3.8 per cent of the total cases registered in the country while neighbor State Nagaland is only at 0.1 per cent. This is a stark contrast when other Northeastern states such as Tripura is at 0.2 per cent with only 276 cases followed by Mizoram at 0.2 per cent as well with 220 cases, Sikkim is at 0.1 per cent with 190 cases, Arunachal Pradesh is also at 0.1 per cent with 138 cases and Manipur with 0.1 per cent as well with 109 cases.</p>
      <p>As alarming as it sounds, as per ASCPCR chairperson Sunita Changkakoti, the boost in numbers is largely due to awareness more than crimes amplifying. “During earlier times, people were not aware that what was going around them was actually criminal. People considered it normal that some children did not go to school or worked in the field because they were economically unsound. However, with social media and the awareness campaigns promoted, people now understand that certain things are criminal. As such, people now-a-days come out and report any incident that is unlawful which was otherwise, swept under the carpet in earlier days. This is also one of the causes behind increase in the number of crimes. I would consider it a positive symptom of change,” said Changkakoti.</p>
