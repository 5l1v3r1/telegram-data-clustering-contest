      <h1>Shopper says John Lewis fitting room policy 'puts women at risk'</h1>

      <p>John Lewis has become involved in a ‘gender neutral’ row over a policy of letting customers use whichever fitting room makes them feel most comfortable.</p>
      <p>Jean Hatchet, a feminist campaigner from Sheffield, went to the department store in the city last weekend to find out if staff allow men into women’s changing rooms.</p>
      <p>She asked if she was allowed to go into the men’s changing room and was told by a manager she could not.</p>
      <p>But she claims that another member of staff elsewhere in the store told her she was able to go into a men’s changing room.</p>
      <p>She later tweeted John Lewis asking for its policy to be clarified and received a reply a week later saying it is up to staff discretion.</p>
      <p>The reply stated: ‘As an inclusive business, our policy states that customers are welcome to use whichever fitting room makes them feel the most comfortable.</p>

      <p>‘As a co-owned business, we empower our partners to use their own judgement on how this policy should be applied on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>‘Regardless of specific policy, if a customer were to act inappropriately, the necessary action would be taken.’</p>

      <p>Ms Hatchet later tweeted about the policy, saying: ‘They will let men in female changing rooms. That’s that. No debate.</p>
      <p>‘Why do all these stores hate women?’</p>
      <p>Ms Hatchet told MailOnline the policy ‘puts women and girls at risk from predatory men’.</p>
      <p>She also tweeted the store directly to ask: ‘Which changing room do you think a rapist of women would feel “most comfortable in”?’</p>
      <p>Other Twitter users replied to Ms Hatchet and said they would boycott the store as a result.</p>
      <p>One wrote: ‘If I feel uncomfortable in a changing room with men in it, then there’s no changing room for me to use?’</p>
      <p>A John Lewis spokesman said the policy has been in place for a number of years.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘As an inclusive business, our customers are welcome to use whichever fitting room makes them feel the most comfortable.</p>
      <p>When developing any shop policy, we always consult with relevant stakeholders across the business and, where appropriate, outside of our business.</p>
      <p>‘When it comes to putting policy into practice, as a co-owned business we ensure that all of our Partners understand their responsibilities and exercise their judgment appropriately. Regardless of specific policy, if any customer were to act inappropriately, the necessary action would be taken.’</p>
