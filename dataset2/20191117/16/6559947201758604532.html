      <p><a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/91914/airpod-alternatives-the-best-true-wireless-earbuds">Wireless earphones</a> are a popular item, and Apple appears to offer one of the most popular choices. However, that doesn't mean they're actually the best. The <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/reviews/123347/apple-airpods-pro">AirPods Pro</a>, which Apple released this fall, earned a less favorable rating than Samsung's <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/samsung-galaxy-buds">Galaxy Buds</a> in a comparison done by <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/headphones/apple-airpods-pro-earphones-review/">Consumer Reports</a>. It just turns out that, despite Apple rolling out new features and technology, the AirPods Pro don't offer best-in-class audio to beat out the competition.</p>
      <p>The AirPods Pro exceed <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/120302/apple-airpods-2nd-generation">previous models</a> with enhanced audio quality, but Consumer Reports suggests there's something left to be desired with these wireless earphones. Specifically, the Galaxy Buds released earlier this year unleash a more high-end experience. It's possible that AKG, a Samsung-owned subsidiary with decades of experience in acoustics, puts the Galaxy Buds ahead.</p>
      <p>"The Echo Buds, Amazon's new noise-canceling true wireless headphones, didn't score quite as well in our tests, but they're solid performers and far cheaper at $130," Consumer Reports said. "And while the AirPods Pro sound far better than Apple's earlier models, they still don't meet the audio quality of our top pick for true wireless sound, the Samsung Galaxy Buds, which also sell for around $130."</p>

      <p>Consumer Reports didn't care all that much for the silicone tips, either. Users might find that their ears feel "plugged up," but at least Apple includes three sizes to figure out an appropriate fit.</p>
      <p>Of course, Consumer Reports still applauded plenty of things about the AirPods Pro. The wireless earphones offer above-average audio quality, active noise cancelation, and a transparency mode to feed outside sound. Apple's AirPods Pro are an excellent choice due to tight integration with other products made by the Cupertino-based company.</p>
      <p>So don't worry if you purchased the AirPods Pro already or plan on <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/deals/118221/black-friday-uk-2019-the-best-deals-on-laptops-tvs-gaming-and-tech">getting them during the holidays</a>. They're not going to disappoint unless you're an audiophile, and the simplistic tie-in with iPhone, iPad, and Mac appeals Apple's customers more than anything else.</p>
