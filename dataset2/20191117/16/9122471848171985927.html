      <h1>Ticket Prices For The Redskins-Jets Game Are Embarrassing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:31:27+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The Washington Redskins (1-8) are set to host the New York Jets (2-7) at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland this afternoon. Who’s excited?</p>
      <p>Not too many people, unsurprisingly.</p>
      <p>This is one of the worst matchups of the NFL’s regular season and, outside of getting to see rookie Dwayne Haskins make a start at quarterback, there’s not much to be excited about.</p>
      <p>Ticket prices for the game appear to reflect that…</p>

      <p>It’s extremely rare to see lower-level tickets for an NFL game at such a low price.</p>
      <p>Based on the matchup, though, it’s not surprising. The crowd at FedEx Field will likely be extremely sparse this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Kickoff between the Jets and Redskins is set for 1 p.m. E.T. It’ll be on FOX.</p>
