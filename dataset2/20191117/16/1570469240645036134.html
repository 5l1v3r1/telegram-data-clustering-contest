      <p>Iraqis flooded the streets of the capital and southern cities on Sunday in a general strike that bolstered the weeks-long movement demanding a government overhaul.</p>
      <p>Sit-ins have become the go-to tactic for the rallies that erupted in early October in rage over corruption, a lack of jobs and an out-of-touch political class.</p>
      <p>They have resisted efforts by security forces to snuff them out and on Sunday, thousands came out across the country after activists called for a general strike.</p>
      <p>In the southern hotspots of Kut, Najaf, Diwaniyah and Nasiriyah, schools and government offices were shut as swelling crowds hit the streets.</p>
      <p>Protesters cut roads in the oil-rich port city of Basra by burning tyres and in Hillah, south of Baghdad, students and other activists massed in front of the provincial headquarters. </p>
      <p>"We'll keep up our protest and general strike with all Iraqis until we force the government to resign," said Hassaan al-Tufan, a lawyer and activist.</p>
      <p>In Baghdad hundreds of students skipped class to gather in Tahrir (Liberation) Square, the beating heart of the protest movement.</p>
      <p>"No politics, no parties, this is a student awakening!" read one banner carried by young Iraqis with rucksacks. </p>
      <p>They waved the Iraqi tricolour, marching north from Tahrir to the nearby Khallani Square.</p>
      <p>Security forces had pulled back from their positions along that street early Saturday and demonstrators spilled out into those neighbourhoods and onto the nearby Al-Sinek bridge.</p>
      <p>They immediately set up tents on a first segment of the bridge, facing off against riot police stationed behind two layers of thick concrete blast walls. </p>
      <p>Just beyond those barriers was the embassy of neighbouring Iran, which protesters have criticised for propping up the government they want to bring down.</p>
      <p>"We students are here to help the other protesters, and we won't retreat a single step," said a teenager wearing thick black-framed glasses.</p>
      <p>Speaking anonymously because he said he had been threatened for his involvement in the anti-government movement, he said hundreds of teenagers had skipped class.</p>
      <p>Nearby, a volunteer medic in plastic surgeons' gloves urged labourers across Iraq to join the strike. </p>
      <p>"Everyone should have a time set aside to take part in the protest," he said.</p>
      <p>The government has proposed a laundry list of reforms in recent weeks but demonstrators have brushed them off as too little, too late in a country ranked the 12th most corrupt in the world by Transparency International.</p>
      <p>"These steps, these reforms are just an opiate for the masses. Nothing more, nothing less," another protester said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Pointing across the river to the area where parliament, the premier's office and other key buildings are, he insisted the protesters wanted "new faces." </p>
      <p>"There are so many capable young people in Iraq who are deprived -- and unfortunately those are the guys that rule us?" he said. </p>
