      <p>On Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “Face The Nation,” of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called President Donald Trump’s actions “so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi said, “It’s really a sad thing. I mean, what the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did, that at some point Richard Nixon cared about the country enough to recognize that this could not continue. The Intelligence Committee is leading this part of the inquiry. There are other depositions that are being taken by more committees.”</p>
      <p>She added, “So some of the depositions will continue, and then what takes place in the intelligence public will continue for another week. I don’t know how much longer,” she continued. “I guess it depends on how many more witnesses they have. That’s up to the committee. I don’t guide that. That’s up to the committee.”</p>

        <i>Partial transcript as Follows:</i>
      </p>
      <blockquote>BRENNAN: There will be an intelligence report written up and then what? Does the president get, as he says, to confront his accuser or get due process? PELOSI: What do you mean confront his accuser? Confront the whistleblower? BRENNAN: Presumably, that’s what he means. PELOSI: Well, I will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower. So the president could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants– BRENNAN: You don’t expect him to do that? PELOSI: –if he wants to take the oath of office or he could do it in writing. He has every opportunity to present his case. But it’s really a sad thing. I mean, what the president did was so much worse than even what Richard Nixon did, that at some point Richard Nixon cared about the country enough to recognize that this could not continue. The Intelligence Committee is leading this part of the inquiry. There are other depositions that are being taken by more committees. So some of the depositions will continue and then what takes place in the intelligence public will continue for another week. I don’t know how much longer. I guess it depends on how many more witnesses they have. That’s up to the committee. I don’t guide that. That’s up to the committee.</blockquote>
