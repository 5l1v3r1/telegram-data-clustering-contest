      <h1>Read about seven people in court this week</h1>
      <h2>Cases were heard in Nottingham and Sheffield courts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:25:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Sherdley</a></address>
      <p>This week Ferrari and Porsche drivers ended up in court after a smash which left their cars wrecked.</p>
      <p>Porsche driver, 27-year-old Henry Hibbs from Middlefield in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ollerton">Ollerton</a>, and the driver of a Ferrari, 32-year-old Carl Hartley from Swadlincote in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, are due to be sentenced for dangerous driving on a date to be fixed.</p>
      <p>Hartley left the scene - but later identified himself as being involved in the collision. He said his brakes had failed and caused him to collide with the Porsche.</p>
      <p>But an extensive investigation by officers into the circumstances surrounding the incident, between Rotherham and Sheffield, showed that wasn't the case.</p>
      <p>The airbag unit from the Ferrari was shipped overseas where a professional was able to confirm at what speed the airbags in the vehicle were deployed - 68mph. The road that the cars collided on has a 50mph speed limit.</p>
      <p>A collisions investigator carried out tests on the car to check for damage to the braking system - and no damage was found.</p>

      <h3>The latest cases before the courts</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Man kicked car</h4>
          <p>A girlfriend refused to hand over a man's car keys after he drunkenly tried to cook breakfast after a night out.</p>
          <p>She also told 30-year-old David Ashmore that he could not borrow her vehicle which was parked outside, a court heard.</p>
          <p>Ashmore rode off on his bicycle in Stapleford on August 31.</p>
          <p>Robert Carr, prosecuting, told the court: "He said he would smash her car up and picked up a wooden pool cue."</p>
          <p>He then went out of the house and kicked her car, which is owned by her employer.</p>
          <p>At court, he was ordered to do 50 hours community work and pay £250 towards repairs. He admitted causing damage on Rockford Court, Stapleford.</p>
          <p>Ashmore is still in a relationship with the woman but now lives in Shorwell Road,<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/inquest-held-after-carlton-builder-3529419"> Carlton.</a></p>

          <p>A homeless man fell asleep in a doorway and reacted badly when he was woken by a PCSO.</p>
          <p>Startled Daniel McConnell, 43, began to swear at the officer who found him on Goose Gate, city <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">magistrates</a> heard.</p>
          <p>After spitting on the floor, his second burst of spittle landed on one of the officer's trouser legs.</p>
          <p>It led to his arrest. He was sentenced to one day in custody on Wednesday, November 13.</p>
          <p>Because he had spent a night in the cells, he was released immediately.</p>
          <p>He admitted assaulting an emergency worker and being drunk and disorderly.</p>

            <b>The grey Ferrari 458 following the collision</b>
          </p>
          <p>Two supercar drivers involved in a crash which left their vehicles wrecked have been convicted of dangerous driving.</p>
          <p>Police were called to a crash involving a Ferrari 458 and a Porsche on May 20 last year.</p>
          <p>The driver of the Porsche, 27-year-old Henry Hibbs from Middlefield in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/ollerton">Ollerton</a>, suffered minor injuries.</p>
          <p>But the driver of the Ferrari, 32-year-old Carl Hartley from Swadlincote in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, had fled the scene.</p>
          <p>Hartley later identified himself as being involved in the collision. He said his brakes had failed and caused him to collide with the Porsche.</p>
          <p>But an extensive investigation by officers into the circumstances surrounding the incident, between Rotherham and Sheffield, showed that wasn't the case.</p>
          <p>The airbag unit from the Ferrari was shipped overseas where a professional was able to confirm at what speed the airbags in the vehicle were deployed - 68mph. The road that the cars collided on has a 50mph speed limit.</p>
          <p>A collisions investigator carried out tests on the car to check for damage to the braking system - and no damage was found.</p>
          <p>Within the investigation, officers appealed to the public for information and witnesses who had seen the cars earlier in the evening.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Numerous witnesses came forward, all highlighting the ‘dangerous’, ‘unsafe’ and ‘racing-style’ behaviour that the drivers had been showcasing across South Yorkshire.</p>
          <p>Both vehicles were also captured on CCTV footage at various locations exceeding the speed limits of the road they were on.</p>
          <p>Hartley pleaded guilty at Sheffield Crown Court to dangerous driving.</p>
          <p>Hibbs pleaded not guilty to dangerous driving, but was found guilty of the offence by a jury at the court after a week-long trial which ended on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
          <p>Both men will appear before Sheffield Crown Court at a date to be fixed for sentencing.</p>

            <b>Nottingham Crown Court</b>
          </p>
          <p>A mum must get help after being caught with a knife for the second time.</p>
          <p>Janet Burrows, 57, admitted the latest offence at Nottingham Crown Court, where she was ordered to get treatment for alcohol troubles and attend a probation course.</p>
          <p>She was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and has been in custody since the incident on August 2.</p>
          <p>Kevin Jones, prosecuting, said that police were called out and arrested Burrows, of Lime Street, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sutton-in-ashfield">Sutton-in-Ashfield</a>.</p>
          <p>"Officers spoke to her over some sort of incident at home. Her son contacted the police.</p>
          <p>"She said she had a blade in her bag," said Mr Jones. It was found when police looked into it.</p>
          <p>She pleaded guilty to possession of a bladed article in August.</p>

          <h4>Dangerous driver in court</h4>
          <p>A dangerous driver took his Ford Mondeo on the wrong side of the road in a police chase.</p>
          <p>Police saw black smoke coming from Dylan French's car when he pressed the accelerator.</p>
          <p>Instead of stopping when asked, the 27-year-old sped away and went onto the wrong side of the road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-crown-court">Nottingham Crown Court</a> heard.</p>
          <p>Stuart Lody, prosecuting, told the court there was a short chase in a heavily built-up area where there were many pedestrians and vehicles parked on either side.</p>
          <p>"He sped away, travelling in excess of the 30mph limit".</p>
          <p>An approaching car narrowly avoided a collision as French went onto the wrong side of Bath Street in Ilkeston and then onto Manners Road, the court heard.</p>
          <p>The pursuit ended when the car hit a raised kerb on a roundabout. He was arrested on August 26.</p>
          <p>French, formerly of Nuthall Road, Aspley, admitted dangerous driving. An immediate motoring ban was imposed but his sentence was delayed until April 28.</p>

          <h4>Police found drunk man lying on tram tracks after attack</h4>

          <p>A drunk man was found lying in the middle of a tram line after calling police when attacked in the Market Square.</p>
          <p>Former asylum seeker Nader Adam, 23, had an injured knee and initially refused to move from the track, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/man-found-guilty-non-recent-3537005">city magistrates</a> heard.</p>
          <p>But officers eventually persuaded him to get into their patrol car and was taken to an address where they believed he lived, said Robert Carr, prosecuting.</p>
          <p>Adam then got out of the vehicle, only to block its path by lying in the road. As officers carefully pulled away, they looked back to see him in the road again.</p>
          <p>He was arrested for being drunk and disorderly on Chippenham Road,<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/its-like-living-hotel-inside-3471180"> Lenton</a>. Adam admitted this charge along with having a small amount of cannabis found in a search.</p>
          <p>A £200 fine and £117 costs were ordered from Adam, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/fuel-storage-tanks-brought-down-3537073">Colwick</a> Woods Court, Colwick.</p>
