      <h1>Tesla quietly updates its 3rd-slowest sedan to be quicker than the Ferrari Testarossa</h1>

      <p>When Tesla released the Mid-Range Model 3, it was positioned as an entry-level vehicle that is designed to provide a practical, reasonably-priced way for customers to get into the company’s ecosystem. The Mid-Range Model 3 was thus conservatively specced, with performance figures that were closer to that of the Standard Range Model 3 than the more expensive Long Range AWD variant. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/mid-range-tesla-model-3-45k-260-mile-battery/">Mid-Range Tesla Model 3</a> was launched with a 0-60 mph time of 5.6 seconds, a top speed of 125 mph, and a range of 260 miles. Since Tesla was not able to manufacture its Standard Range battery packs yet then, the electric car maker equipped the Mid-Range Model 3 with a Long Range battery pack with fewer cells, giving the vehicle its 260-mile range. The Mid-Range Model 3 was ultimately retired upon the arrival of the Standard Range and Standard Range Plus Model 3, which took its place as Tesla’s entry-level vehicle. </p>
      <p>Being part of the Model 3 family, the Mid-Range Model 3 has received improvements that the company has rolled out to the vehicle. In January, for one, Tesla updated the vehicle’s range to <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-model-s-consumer-reports-recommendation/">264 miles per charge</a>. Last March, the vehicle’s performance received improvements as well. And with Tesla’s most recent 5% over-the-air performance boost, the Mid-Range Model 3 got better once more. </p>
      <p>Tesla owner-enthusiast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCv5d0EHCET4Nj8OGTzu0OA">nukem384</a>, who owns a Mid-Range Model 3, recently tested his vehicle’s acceleration after receiving the electric car maker’s most recent performance update. In the Tesla owner’s tests, the Mid-Range Model 3 was able to sprint from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds consistently. These figures are incredibly impressive, considering that breaking the 5-second barrier places the Mid-Range Model 3 into high-performance car territory. </p>
      <p>Such acceleration numbers, in fact, actually make the Mid-Range Model 3 quicker from 0-60 mph than the legendary and <a href="https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/editors-picks-aspark-hypercar-patek-phillipe-watch-and-paul-smith-gin/">iconic Ferrari Testarossa</a>, which was one of the Italian supercar-maker’s most recognizable vehicles to date. The Testarossa is arguably one of Ferrari’s best creations, and the exhaust note from its naturally-aspirated V12 engines is nothing short of legendary. The vehicle also received cult status for being the hero car in the popular show <i>Miami Vice</i>. </p>
      <p>Performance-wise, the Testarossa is nothing to scoff about. The supercar is worthy of its Ferrari badge, with its 0-60 mph time of 5.2 seconds and its top speed of 180 mph. Mid-engined, raw, and unapologetically manual, the Testarossa is probably one of the most recognizable Ferraris ever made. A proper supercar, and one that is now capable of being outrun by a young automaker’s “3rd-slowest” family sedan after a <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-s-model-x-range-increase-ota-power-update/">free over-the-air software update</a>. </p>
      <p>In the age of electric cars and internet-connected vehicles, over-the-air performance updates are a true difference-maker. Tesla is arguably the only automaker that does this today, but hopefully, as more carmakers follow the trend of tech-centric high-performance cars, OTA performance updates will soon be the norm. Until then, Tesla’s electric cars will likely keep improving as evidenced by a Tesla Model 3 Performance, a car without a dedicated Launch Mode, recently <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-0-60-mph-in-2-9-sec-after-ota-software-update/">breaking the 3-second barrier</a> in a 0-60 mph test.</p>
