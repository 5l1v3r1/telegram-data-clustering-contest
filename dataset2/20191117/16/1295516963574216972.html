      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:11:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Adreon Patterson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/tales-from-the-dark-multiverse/">Tales from the Dark Multiverse: Blackest Night</a> writer, Tim Seeley recently explained why Dove played such a significant role in the storyline.</p>
      <p>During <a href="https://www.cbr.com/blackest-night-tim-seeley-interview/">an interview</a> with CBR, Seeley spoke on Dove's past within the DC Comics universe and how it influenced her position in the story<i>. </i>According to Seeley, <i>Tales from the Dark Multiverse:</i> <i>Blackest Night </i>was his chance to do a "correction" on Dove's canon, putting her into the spotlight even more.</p>
      <p>"The part of the fun of these is, you can correct the things that bothered you," Seeley stated. "I thought she should be more important to the universe than she was in that particular story. So I got to play my version of events and do my quote -- unquote "correction" and put her in the forefront."</p>

      <p>Before the events of <i>Blackest Night</i>, Dawn Granger and her sister Holly were holding up the Hawk and Dove mantle. This was because the original Hawk, Hank Hall, had died in the pages of <i>Justice Society of America</i>.</p>
      <p>"But for her, she's been through something pretty horrible...," he elaborated, speaking about Dove's position before <i>Blackest Night</i>. "Because she had to turn away from her partner, I think she feels as though she doesn't know what her place in this is."</p>
      <p>Seeley added, "If she's supposed to be this great avatar, why was she the one who abandoned Hawk? I think that that's kind of her motivation is this redemption track, to feel like she earned being picked as Avatar of Order."</p>
      <p>Since the conclusion of the original <i>Blackest Night</i>, Granger has appeared in DC's New 52 and more recently, DC's "Rebirth" line. Currently, she is also being portrayed by Minka Kelly in DC Universe's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/titans-tv/"><i>Titans</i></a>.</p>
