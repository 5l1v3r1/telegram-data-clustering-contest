      <h1>Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa Speaks Out After Season-Ending Injury (TWEET)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:22:49+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:22</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa’s injury has been ruled a dislocated right hip and the Alabama quarterback will miss the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>It’s a sad ending to one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in college football that will likely mark the end of his tenure with the Crimson Tide as he gets ready to rehab and get ready for the NFL Draft.</p>

      <p>Alabama released a statement providing an update on Tagovailoa’s status, per The Athletic’s Bruce Feldman:</p>
      <p>“Tua Tagovailoa sustained a right hip dislocation that was immediately reduced at the stadium. He is undergoing further testing to determine the best course of treatment. He is expected to make a full recovery but will miss the remainder of the season.”</p>
      <p>Shortly after the news came down, Tua took to Twitter and thanked everybody for their prayers and well wishes.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa was the favorite to be the No. 1 quarterback selected in the 2020 NFL draft, but now that line seems to have shifted to LSU’s Joe Burrow.</p>
      <p>The only knock on him for multiple analysts and experts is his health going forward. He has now had two ankle surgeries and a serious hip injury within the last year.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa’s main concern is making a full recovery that will allow him to get back on the field.</p>
