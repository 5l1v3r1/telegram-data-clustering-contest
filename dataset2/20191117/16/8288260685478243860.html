      <p>James Arthur has been forced to quit Twitter - after being left "hurt" by trolls online.</p>
      <p>The singer said some of the abuse directed at him had gone too far.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old, who shot to fame through ITV1 talent show The X factor, told trolls that if that was their aim, they had won.</p>
      <p>Arthur - who has previously spoken about his experience of depression and anxiety - tweeted on Sunday: "Have to be honest some of the things I read on here go a bit too far and quite frankly f***** hurt, if that was your goal you win."</p>
