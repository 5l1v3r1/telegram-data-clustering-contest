      <h1>Katie Hopkins' vile post about debt comes back to haunt her as she's forced to sell £1m family home</h1>
      <h2>The outspoken far-rightwinger once said people with financial troubles only have themselves to blame</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:20:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:20</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Fans of irony are celebrating today after an old tweet from Katie Hopkins resurfaced - just as it was revealed she's in a precarious financial situation herself.</p>
      <p>Because the far-rightwinger has been forced to sell off her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-katie-hopkins-five-bedroom-11879232">her £1million Devon home</a>  and now rents after a humiliating court case wiped out her finances.</p>
      <p>It comes after she had to take out an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) after racking up crippling debts from losing a libel case against writer and anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe.</p>
      <p>Having lost her radio show at LBC and getting dropped as a columnist for the Daily Mail, Hopkins is now repaying her creditors through a debt management scheme.</p>
      <p>But in March 2014 - just four and a half years before her own money struggles - Katie had poured scorn on those who find themselves in debt.</p>

      <p>She'd tweeted: "The only thing people in debt have in common other than bad money management, is an ability to blame anyone but themselves."</p>
      <p>That tweet is now coming back to haunt her as her critics pointed out the pure irony.</p>
      <p>"Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/KTHopkins/">@KTHopkins</a> , what was that you said about people who are in debt because of their own stupidity?" one asked.</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "People who are in debt I have no sympathy for or who’ve got an IVA I believe. They need kicking to the kerb if they can’t manage their finances, what say you? They are leeches. What do you think?"</p>

      <p>And a third tweeted: " <a href="https://twitter.com/KTHopkins/">@KTHopkins</a> who once blamed people in debt for not managing their finances, enters IVA (after selling house) to pay defamation damages. All she had to do was apologise to <a href="https://twitter.com/BootstrapCook/">@BootstrapCook</a> ."</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sunday Times this weekend, racist <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-forced-sell-1m-20899416">Hopkins whinged that speaking her mind lost her her career</a> - having compared migrants crossing the Mediterranean in dinghies to "cockroaches" and claiming she'd use gunships to prevent people from landing on European shores.</p>
      <p>"I live in a rented, modern, four-bedroom detached house with my husband Mark and our three children, aged 15, 14 and 10," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's tucked out of the way for security reasons - our last home was rigged up to the local police station and had panic alarms fitted because of threats I received to my life.</p>
      <p>"I was forced to sell it for £950,000 in early 2018 to pay off a legal bill in excess of £500,000."</p>
      <p>While she didn't apologise for the circumstances leading up to the 2017 legal case - she'd falsely accused anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe of vandalising a war memorial - Hopkins did express regret that she hadn't acted sooner to settle the case out of court.</p>
      <p>Jack Monroe announced her legal foe had turned to a debt management plan in the wake of racking up more than £130,000 in legal fees and damages over a defamatory tweet.</p>

      <p>"I can confirm today that following that landmark libel case, Katie Hopkins has entered into an IVA to avoid bankruptcy. I knew for a while but could not say anything for legal reasons. The arbitrary defender of free speech didn't want anyone to know, ironically..." Jack tweeted.</p>
      <p>"I have been paid in full, but many of her creditors, including my lawyer, will not be paid what they are owed. For the want of an apology, a house, a job, a column, a radio show, and now financial solvency, were lost. It's all very sad, actually."</p>
      <p>Jack added: "I'm not cruel nor celebrating - that case cost me 18 months of sanity and work, and I think neither of us wanted it to turn out this way."</p>

      <h3>What is an IVA?</h3>
      <p>An individual voluntary arrangement - known as an IVA - is a formal and legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your debts over a period of time, Citizens Advice says.</p>
      <p>It is approved by the court and creditors must agree to abide by its terms.</p>
      <p>Usually the applicant will repay a certain amount each month for a period of a few years.</p>
      <p>An IVA is a type of insolvency but is different from bankruptcy.</p>
      <p>It can only be set up by a qualified professional, known as an insolvency practitioner, who will deal with creditors throughout the term of the IVA.</p>
      <p>However, the practitioner will charge a fee to manage the IVA, which tends to cost around £5,000.</p>
      <p>If the applicant does not have enough money to pay off their full debt, the rest can be written off.</p>
      <p>But if the creditors refuse to accept less payment, the IVA may fail and the applicant can be made bankrupt.</p>
      <p>Jack confirmed she knew the terms of Hopkins' IVA as one of her creditors, and said she "checked that her children will not be destitute".</p>
      <p>After Hopkins sent the libellous tweet in 2015, Jack asked for a public apology and a donation of £5,000 to a charity helping migrants.</p>
      <p>But Katie refused to play ball, ending up in court having to hand over £24,000 in damages and a further £107,000 in costs that had to be repaid within 28 days.</p>
