      <p>Call To Worship has announced their annual music event will be held on the 23rd of November. An interdenominational Christian event that has been going on now for the past 11 years. The biggest interdenominational Christian event will be held at Harare Gardens and will be Free for all to attend.</p>
      <p>Through the continued support of sponsors like Econet wireless, ZiFM and other key stakeholders the event has continually managed to reach new heights gathering some of the best talents the nation has had to offer. Gospel artists from across the continent have been performing at this event annually for years now. This year plans to be just as exciting with new gospel artists from South Africa and Nigeria expected while all the nation’s favourite gospel choirs and Christian bodies will be present at the event. The event will start with Youth Power Praise from 12 pm to 3 pm.</p>
      <p>Youth power praise is an empowerment session focusing on empowering the youth. This event is a workshop and seminar being led by industry leaders and experts to speak to young people on how to build a successful career. Last year the event saw Honourable Kirsty Coventry speaking at the event. This year plans to be just as exciting with a new coaching program that will see young people stand the chance to be coached by industry experts in different fields from business development to music to digital media as well as finding spiritual life coaches. After the event, the main Concert will begin from 4 pm to 8:30 pm</p>
