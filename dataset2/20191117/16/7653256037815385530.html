      <p>RANCHI: Union minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Prakash-Javadekar">Prakash Javadekar</a> on Sunday asserted that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BJP">BJP</a>'s developmental work in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> has ensured full faith of people in the party ahead of the assembly polls, while taking a dig at the opposition alliance for "looting" and "tarnishing" the image of the state.</p>
      <p>Javadekar, who was here to inaugurate the BJP's media centre, said the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/saffron">saffron</a> party has been successful in establishing a stable and development-oriented government in the state during the last five years.</p>
      <p>"The BJP would get the full faith of the people during the upcoming assembly elections purely on the grounds of development," said the Union Environment, Forest, Information and Broadcasting Minister.</p>
      <p>The Jharkhand assembly polls will be held in five phases between November 30 and December 20, and the counting of votes will take place on December 23.</p>
      <p>Javadekar alleged that the parties in the opposition alliance -- comprising the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a>, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the RJD -- ruined the image of the state "through a spate of scams" and "prolonging" the statehood for several years.</p>
      <p>"Instead of paving the way for the creation of Jharkhand, the parties were busy creating themselves," the minister said.</p>
      <p>The state of Jharkhand was carved out of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bihar">Bihar</a> in 2000, and the BJP credits former prime minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Atal-Bihari-Vajpayee">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</a> for having played a key role in it.</p>
      <p>"The people of the state had voted for a clean government and for development and stability," he said, pointing to the formation of nine governments in Jharkhand till 2014, before the BJP came to power.</p>
      <p>"Even the opposition could not level any allegations of corruption during the term of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Raghubar-Das">Raghubar Das</a>," he asserted.</p>
      <p>Schemes of the Centre like the Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Bharat and Krishi Ashirwad Yojana have benefited lakhs of families in the state, Javadekar said.</p>
      <p>"A total of 1.17 lakh people got government jobs in the last five years... The poor got more than five lakh dwellings, while 43,000 tribals got land documents," he claimed.</p>
