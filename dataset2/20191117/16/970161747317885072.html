        <b>Gerwyn Price finally got a win over Michael van Gerwen at the 20th attempt as he beat the Dutchman 16-12 in the Grand Slam of Darts semi-final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>19 times the pair had met previously with MVG winning 18 of them and Price taking just one <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> draw from the world number one.</p>
      <p>However, he finally broke his duck against the world champion with a superb performance in Wolverhampton, averaging 100.73 to oust the tournament favourite.</p>
      <p>Price, the defending champion at the Grand Slam, will not go on to face Peter Wright in the final later on Sunday evening, having got ‘a demon off his back.’</p>
      <p>‘He is one of the best professionals in the world, I was nervous towards the end, but I’ve got a win over him now so I’m happy,’ said the Iceman.</p>
      <p>‘I played well early on, tapered off in the middle and well at the end, so I’m happy.</p>

      <p>‘He’s been lucky the last three times, I thought he was going to get lucky again but I’ve got a demon off my back.</p>
      <p>‘I thought I played pretty well in that game, so did Michael, I scored all right and when I had chances I took them, except near the end there.</p>
      <p>‘I just come up here to play, try the best I can to play the board, I’ve just beaten Michael, Peter isn’t going to be easy, but I’ll try to get over the line.’</p>
      <p>Van Gerwen took the lead in the opening leg of the match but was chasing Price for much of the game, with the Welshman taking a 4-1 lead early on.</p>
      <p>The world number one was hardly playing badly, finishing with an average of 101.91 and hitting 12 maximums to Price’s six, but it was the underdog’s finishing which made the difference.</p>
      <p>The defending champion missed three match darts as he got nervy at the end, but finished the match with a checkout ratio of 53.33% to Van Gerwen’s 35.29%.</p>
      <p>Price and Wright are meeting for the second time in a major final after Snakebite beat the Iceman 11-6 in the 2017 UK Open final.</p>
      <p>However, the Welshman has one win from three major finals while the Scot has one from 10, so he will fancy his chances of gaining revenge.</p>
