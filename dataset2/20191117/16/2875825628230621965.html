      <h1>Inside Katie Hopkins five-bedroom £1million mansion she was forced to sell over legal debts</h1>
      <h2>The colourfully decorated family retreat is currently on the market for £950,000</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:32:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Featuring a neon coloured open plan kitchen, country cottage courtyard, and a lurid hot pink carpet in the living room, these photos reveal the million pound mansion Katie Hopkins has been forced to sell after losing a libel case over two tweets.</p>
      <p>The luxurious five-bedroom family house was sold for £950,000 following <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/katie-hopkins-forced-sell-1m-20899416">Katie's legal defeat to food writer Jack Monroe</a> last year.</p>
      <p>Located in a quiet suburb of leafy Exeter, the former columnist's home had provided a retreat from her hectic showbiz commitments in London.</p>

      <p>Boasting a generously-sized kitchen with separate utility room, the property would be an ideal base for a large family.</p>
      <p>The house also features three separate reception rooms - one of which Katie transformed into a music room - and a downstairs cloakroom and shower.</p>
      <p>All five bedrooms are spacious and future buyers would enjoy the luxury of a recently refitted large bathroom on the first floor.</p>

      <p>The top tier of the house features a huge double bedroom with connected dressing room and bathroom.</p>
      <p>And the exterior is every bit as stunning with green space, a double garage and even a 'country cottage courtyard.'</p>
      <p>Katie once proudly led Now magazine around her Exeter property, as she showed off personal touches including her David Bowie posters and Nigella cookbooks in kitchen</p>

      <p>Back in March 2017 Jack Munroe sued for £24,000 in damages in a High Court Libel action against controversial columnist Katie.</p>
      <p>After announcing his decision, Mr Justice Warby ordered Hopkins to pay £107,000 on account of costs within 28 days. She also has to pay her own legal costs, which are believed to run into more than double Monroe's.</p>
      <p>Monroe, who also campaigns on poverty issues, was asking a judge at the High Court in London to find that she was "defamed" by the former Apprentice contestant.</p>
      <p>At the heart of the action is a posting on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in May 2015.</p>

      <p>Monroe tweeted:"For the want of apology a trial was lost For the want of a trial a job was lost For the want of a job another was lost For the want of another an income was lost For the want of an income a house was lost And all for the want of an apology."</p>
      <p>Speaking after the trial, Monroe told her fans: "It's taken 21 months but today the High Court ruled that Hopkins statements to/about me were defamatory. I sued her for libel. and I won.</p>
      <p>"I'll be writing a longer statement shortly, but for now, to everyone who told me I couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't - I could, I would, I did. And now that I can actually breathe, first I am going to hammer my book over the finishing line for those who backed it, and me. Thankyou."</p>
