      <p>California-based jockeys Kent Desormeaux and Martin Garcia are shifting their tacks eastward.</p>
      <p>The Hall of Fame rider Desormeaux has relocated to his home state of Louisiana and is riding at Fair Grounds. The New Orleans track’s 2019-20 meet starts Nov. 28 and runs to March 29.</p>
      <p>Desormeaux has posted 34 wins in 269 starts this year, collecting $2,476,314 in earnings, while racing primarily in Southern California. Four of those wins were graded, highlighted by Ollie’s Candy taking the Grade 1 Clement L. Hirsch Stakes on July 28 at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>Fair Grounds’ winter meet will mark a change of pace for Desormeaux, who’s recently spent those months at Santa Anita. He started only three times during Del Mar’s current meet, winning one of those races.</p>
      <p>Garcia capped his Del Mar meet Saturday with a win aboard King Abner in an allowance optional claiming event. The native of Mexico is departing for Kentucky and the Midwest circuit.</p>
      <p>Garcia has earned 43 victories and $2,157,078 out of 295 starts this year, highlighted by Acclimate’s score June 23 in the San Juan Capistrano Stakes (G3). He’s entered into eight races from Wednesday through Friday at Churchill Downs.</p>
