      <p>A former Kenmore East High School athlete who tore a ligament in her knee during a field hockey practice is suing the Kenmore-Town of Tonawanda school district over her injury.</p>
      <p>Hannah Munley alleges that she was a member of the school's field hockey team and was running up the field during a summer tryout in August 2018 when she stepped in a rut or other hole in the field and tore the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, and meniscus in one knee.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit doesn't say which knee she injured nor where the tryout took place. The team plays home matches at Adams Field and practices at Adams, Kenmore East and Hoover Elementary school.</p>
      <p>The injuries required surgery, according to the lawsuit, andÂ Munley missed the field hockey and ice hockey seasons, after playing six years of varsity ice hockey.</p>
      <p>The district has not yet responded to the lawsuit, which was filed Nov. 8 in State Supreme Court. Munley is represented by Brown Chiari's David Olson.</p>
