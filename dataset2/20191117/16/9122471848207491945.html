      <h1>Report: 8 Teams Attended The Colin Kaepernick Workout</h1>

      <p>After days of craziness leading up to Colin Kaepernick’s workout in Atlanta yesterday, there were ultimately more than a handful of teams that attended it.</p>
      <p>On Sunday morning, ESPN NFL analyst Adam Schefter announced that eight teams attended the workout.</p>
      <p>Schefter’s initial list of teams consisted of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kansas City Chiefs</li>
        <li>New York Jets</li>
        <li>Philadelphia Eagles</li>
        <li>Tennessee Titans</li>
        <li>San Francisco 49ers</li>
        <li>Washington Redskins</li>
        <li>Detroit Lions</li>
        <li>Buffalo Bills</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1196086880338661377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p>However, Schefter later clarified that the Bills denied attending the workout.</p>
      <p>But he maintains that the other seven teams were there. The identity of the eighth team remains unknown.</p>

      <p>There’s a lot to gleam from the list of teams in attendance.</p>
      <p>Some of those teams seem like surprise choices to send reps to the workout given the stable situations they have at the position. Though it’s worth noting that the Chiefs, Jets, and Eagles have all dealt with injuries to their quarterbacks.</p>
      <p>Others, like the Detroit Lions, Tennessee Titans and Washington Redskins, seem like fairly logical choices.</p>
      <p>But just because 24 teams were missing doesn’t mean that one of those teams won’t ultimately sign the former 49ers quarterback.</p>
      <p>Footage from Kaepernick’s workout will be circulated to the remaining teams.</p>
      <p>It may not happen this week or next week, but there’s still a chance that Kaepernick won’t remain out of the NFL for much longer.</p>
