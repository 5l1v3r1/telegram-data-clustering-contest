      <p>Portugal captain <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Cristiano+Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> scored his 99th international goal as the defending champions edged past Luxembourg 2-0 in difficult conditions away from home on Sunday to qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Bruno+Fernandes">Bruno Fernandes</a> broke the deadlock in the 39th minute and Ronaldo wrapped it up with four minutes left to ensure that Portugal finished second in Group B with 17 points, three ahead of Serbia who drew 2-2 with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Diogo Jota’s shot appeared to be going in any way but Ronaldo prodded it over to claim the goal.</p>
      <p>He is one short of joining Iran’s Ali Daei, the only player to have scored a century of goals for a national team.</p>
      <p>Portugal survived several early scares as they struggled to impose their game on a rain-soaked pitch full of divots at the Josy Barthel stadium.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, in particular, was not enjoying the conditions and gestured angrily at the pitch after sending a speculative wide in the first half.</p>
      <p>Needing a win to qualify without having to worry about Serbia’s result, Portugal were in trouble early on as Luxembourg saw a chance to spring an upset.</p>
      <p>Maurice Deville got above his marker and headed over from Laurent Jans’ cross and Vincent Thill, a thorn in Portugal’s side, had a goalbound shot blocked by Ruben Dias.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg were even closer when a corner found Gerons Rodrigues unmarked but he headed over.</p>
      <p>Portugal began to adapt to the conditions and their more direct approach was rewarded with a goal.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva floated a pass over the Luxembourg defence from deep inside his own half and into the path of Fernandes who took it superbly in his stride and fired a low shot between Anthony Moris and the near post.</p>
      <p>The second half was more comfortable for Portugal as they dominated possession although there still anxious moments.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo nearly sealed it when he curled a free kick narrowly wide from the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>With four minutes left, Silva’s cross found Jota and Moris got a hand to it but could not stop it crossing the line and Ronaldo poked it home for good measure.</p>
