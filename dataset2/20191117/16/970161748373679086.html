      <p>Doggos come in all shapes and sizes. Some of us love tiny little Yorkies and others prefer giant Great Danes.</p>
      <p>Every year, the Kennel Club collects information on the country’s favourite breeds to see which comes out on top.</p>
      <p>The data for 2019 reveals that our favourite dog this year was the labrador.</p>
      <p>The dog had been a favourite in previous years but was knocked off the top shot by the French Bulldog in 2018.</p>
      <p>The French bulldog moved into second position, followed by the cocker spaniel, bulldog and English springer spaniel.</p>
      <p>The golden retriever was in the sixth position, with Dachshunds in seventh, pug coming in eighth place and German shepherds in ninth.</p>
      <p>The final dog in the top 10 this year was the miniature schnauzer.</p>
      <h3>Top 10 breeds of 2019</h3>
      <p>Retriever (labrador)<br/>French Bulldog<br/>Spaniel (cocker)<br/>Bulldog<br/>Spaniel (English springer)<br/>Retriever (Golden)<br/>Dachshund (Miniature smooth haired)<br/>Pug<br/>German shepherd dog<br/>Miniature schnauzer</p>
      <p>The organisation puts the list together by collating the information on dogs registered with them. Of course, not all dogs are registered but it gives us some idea of some trends.</p>

      <p>They also highlighted other breeds that are at risk of dying out.</p>
      <p>The West Highland white terrier, boxer, staffie and border terrier, used to be in the top 10 but are falling down the list.</p>
      <p>And one of Britain’s oldest native dog breeds, the pointer, has for the first time become at risk of extinction, with only 436 registrations in 2019.</p>
      <p>This could place it it the Kennel Club’s ‘At Watch’ list – which highlights breeds that number between 300 and 450 registrations annually, and are at risk of disappearing in the future so they can be closely monitored.</p>
      <p>The pointer’s popularity has slashed almost in half in a decade, while its continental cousin, the German shorthaired pointer is up 25 per cent across the same period.</p>
      <p>In total 16 vulnerable native breeds have declined so far this year, compared to 13 which have increased.</p>
      <p>Bill Lambert, spokesperson for the Kennel Club, said: ‘People simply forget there are so many different dog breeds, with different personalities and characteristics, and it’s not just the popular, well-known ones that make a great match for our varying lifestyles.</p>
      <p>‘These latest figures show that whilst some historic native breeds like the corgi are having a revival, others continue to fall rapidly in popularity and are genuinely at risk of disappearing. While we’re lucky to have such diversity amongst our canine companions, it is worrying that old favourites like the pointer and Parson Russell terrier are dropping in numbers to historical lows.</p>

      <p>‘We urge people to make sure they understand the breed and its characteristics before they make a decision to buy or rescue a dog, and to spend time researching the wide variety of breeds we are lucky to have in this country, to make sure they get the right one for them.</p>
      <p>‘The newly popular chow chow for example, due to its delightful profuse woolly coat, needs a lot of grooming, while the Shiba Inu – which translates to ‘small dog’ – has a big personality and is full of energy.’</p>
      <p>The Club also said that celebrities could be having an impact. For example, the Sussex spaniel, which has experienced a burst in popularity this year compared to the same period in 2018, with registrations increasing by 56 per cent.</p>
      <p>Last year, where the Sussex spaniel was the most vulnerable breed in the UK with just 34 puppies registered with the Kennel Club. The Club say that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex may have had an impact.</p>
