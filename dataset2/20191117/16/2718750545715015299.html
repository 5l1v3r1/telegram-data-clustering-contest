      <p>It gives us no pleasure in saying we’d rather skip a vacation than get on an airplane with <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/harry-styles-says-snl-isnt-good-anymore-monologue.html">Harry Styles</a> as the captain, given that he (1) might be on competing medications, (2) seems to dislike <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/meet-the-breakout-stars-of-booksmart.html"><i>Booksmart</i></a><i>, </i>and (3) has a bunch of pent-up sexual feelings about a cartoon character thanks to his recent lack of horizontal tango activities. “These pipes be clogged,” he complains to his co-pilot. “I saw an old <i>Scooby-Doo</i> episode on the airport TV and Daphne was getting me <i>hot.</i>” At least his nails look good. Like, really good.</p>
