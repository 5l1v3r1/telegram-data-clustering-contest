        <b>Arsenal have opened talks with the father of Brazilian starlet Reinier Jesus, with a view to making a bid for the Flamengo attacker.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old attacking midfielder has made an impression since being promoted to the Flamengo first team in July, scoring four goals in 11 league games so far.</p>
      <p>With Arsenal already having sealed a deal for another Brazilian youngster, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/gabriel-martinelli"><b>Gabriel Martinelli</b></a>, this summer, <i>Mundo Deportivo</i> (via <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-contact-reiniers-father-bid-20899778"><i>The Mirror</i></a>) claim they are set to look to South America again.</p>
      <p>Flamengo have placed a £60m (€70m) release clause in Reinier’s new contract, a price which has put off Spanish giants Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>However, a range of suitors are still queuing up for the prolific Brazil Under-17 international, with Manchester City and Everton also watching on from the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are also mentioned as potential destinations, but <a href="http://teamtalk.com/arsenal"><b>Arsenal</b></a> are understood to have the edge after initiating contact with the player’s father, who has been searching for a European club that would be willing to sign his son.</p>
