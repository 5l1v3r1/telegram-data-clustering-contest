      <h1>Sadio Mane taken off early for Senegal, but only as a precaution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:11:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane was unable to finish Senegal’s game against Eswatini as he had picked up a booking and his team can’t afford to lose him for their next game.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying that the Liverpool star is Senegal’s most important player – if they’re in need of a goal, then it’s often Sadio that they’ll look to.</p>
      <p>The forward was removed from play at half-time because he was visibly upset after being booked, and there was a fear among the Senegal bench that he may get sent off.</p>
      <p>A red card would obviously mean a suspension, and it would be detrimental for the team if they were to lose Mane for that long.</p>
      <p>Some Liverpool fans on social media were concerned that the winger may have been taken off because of an injury. There isn’t much English coverage of the Africa Cup of Nations so there was some confusion.</p>
      <p>We’re happy enough to confirm that Mane wasn’t removed from play because of an injury, and it was simply because of a risk of suspension.</p>
