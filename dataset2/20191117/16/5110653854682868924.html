      <h1>Things reportedly not going well for Vic Fangio's Broncos: 'Everyone gets treated like (crap)'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:00:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tadd Haislop</a></address>
      <p>The Broncos entered Sunday's Week 11 game against the Vikings at 3-6, and based on <a href="https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=sportingnews.com&amp;utm_campaign=sporting%20news&amp;utm_content=top%20bar&amp;utm_term=nfl%20odds">the odds</a>, they wereexpected to drop to 3-7. According to one report, part of the problem with a team trending toward a third consecutive losing season is a rift between the head coach and the players.</p>
      <p>First-year coach Vic Fangio, 61, "has been having a difficult time connecting with players and coaches" this season, "with his often gruff demeanor rubbing many the wrong way and creating internal tension within the team," <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/broncos-vic-fangio-struggling-to-connect-with-players-and-coaches-in-first-season-in-denver/">according to CBS' Jason La Canfora</a>.</p>
      <p>Once source told CBS "there is a negative reaction to almost every offensive play call" in Denver. Added another source: "Pretty much everyone gets treated like (crap). ... But if anything I think it's brought the (coaches) on offense closer together."</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 11 NFL PICKS:<br/><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-against-the-spread/u5np7y4smrzt1jdzpvoum8qln">Against the spread</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/list/week-11-nfl-picks-predictions/1sb3n5rbwqxjg1elyenztbbj0s">Straight-up predictions</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Fangio got the Broncos job because of his long history as a successful NFL defensive coordinator. Before John Elway brought him to Denver in 2019, Fangio spent 19 seasons coordinating defenses in Carolina (1995-98, Indianapolis (1999-01), Houston (2002-05), San Francisco (2011-14) and Chicago (2015-18). His units ranked in the top 10 nine times over that span.</p>
      <p>The Broncos have been solid defensively in 2019; entering Week 11, they ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed per game and seventh in points allowed per game. The issues, of course, have come on the other side of the ball. Only four teams have worse scoring offenses than Denver's unit.</p>
      <p>In describing the Broncos' internal strife, CBS noted "questions" about Joe Flacco's fit in the offense. The quarterback for whom Denver traded early this year, of course, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/joe-flacco-slams-broncos-conservative-late-play-calls-were-a-2-6-football-team/1feyyxgtdmvf11iq3z33r9isji">slammed his team's conservative play-calling</a> after a loss to the Colts a few weeks ago. Flacco eventually was placed on injured reserve with a neck injury.</p>
      <p>One more nugget from CBS' report: "Other sources noted a disconnect between the offense and defense as well, with Fangio's 'people skills,' in their minds, lacking. There is almost no discussion beyond football, sources said, and that, coupled with some staff and personnel issues as well as lingering angst over an eventual sale of this franchise, has created a difficult climate around the team."</p>
      <p>It's worth noting a point Chargers coach Anthony Lynn <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/browns-coach-freddie-kitchens-can-handle-everything-you-think-he-cant/19u1j3burndia17kmy10rrxort">raised with Sporting News</a> back in March while discussing the transition first-year Browns coach Freddie Kitchens was facing: Head coach is a very different job than coordinator. A head coach manages hundreds of people, while coordinators manage a room full of people.</p>
      <p>"I surrounded myself with good coaches, a good staff, good players," said Lynn, who won 21 games in his first two seasons as a head coach. "It's all difficult. You can prepare for it all you want, but until you go through it, it’s a learning process. You’re always evolving."</p>
      <p>Added Colts coach Frank Reich on the same subject: "The key is don’t try to do it all yourself. You got good people around you. Rely on those good people."</p>
      <p>Based on CBS' report, Elway and Co. might need to question whether Fangio is cut out to be a head coach. Just because he is a damn good coordinator doesn't mean he's proficient in, to borrow the words of CBS' source, "people skills."</p>
