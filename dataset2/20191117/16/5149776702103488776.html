      <h1>Waxing salon owner reflects on her success and growth as 10 year anniversary approaches</h1>
      <h2>There are now two branches of nkd, in Nottingham and Leicester</h2>

      <p>A waxing salon owner has paid tribute to her customers as she prepares to celebrate 10 years since opening her first <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/shopping/">shop</a> .</p>
      <p>The last decade has been a whirlwind for entrepreneur Rebecca Dowdeswell, who got married and fell pregnant in between incorporating nkd in June 2009 and opening the first salon in Bridlesmith Walk that December.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old admits the last 10 years have been a tough time to start and build a company, but today she is employing about 15 people and has two branches in Nottingham and Leicester.</p>
      <p>“I feel so proud of what we have created,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Approaching the 10 year anniversary has made me reflect on what things were like in 2009 and so many businesses that are not around now.</p>
      <p>“It has been a really hard decade to build a retail business and survive and grow and I feel really proud we have been able to do that while, unfortunately, an awful lot of businesses haven’t been able to make it through those tough times.</p>

      <p>“I feel really proud.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Dowdeswell didn’t have a natural journey towards starting nkd.</p>
      <p>After leaving university she spent some time working in Brazil, where she was first introduced to waxing.</p>
      <p>When she returned to the UK in 2000, she says “salons were doing (waxing) very badly and it was hard to get a good wax here”.</p>
      <p>She then later travelled around Asia where she found a host of specialist waxing salons, where the idea for nkd first formed.</p>
      <p>But it was not until after the credit crunch in 2007/08 that she decided to take the plunge and set up her own specialist waxing salon.</p>
      <p>She had been working as a journalist and business analyst in the automotive industry, but jobs dried up after the crash.</p>
      <p>She recalled: “I just decided to bite the bullet at that point.</p>
      <p>“I had no background in the beauty industry and had a moment of madness where I thought ‘I am going to do this’.</p>
      <p>“I had no idea about the challenges that would be ahead but I was very confident in the vision and I still am.</p>
      <p>“I have made it work but not without a huge amount of toil and graft and blood, sweat and tears.”</p>
      <p>The salon moved to its current home in Pelham Street in 2015, having been previously based in Bridlesmith Walk. The Leicester branch opened in 2017.</p>
      <p>The company now offers both female and male waxing services and a lash and brow bar.</p>
      <p>Asked what has enabled the firm to grow in the last decade, Mrs Dowdeswell pointed to her focus on customers.</p>
      <p>She said: “I have always looked at it from the customer’s point of view.</p>
      <p>“For us, the customer has always been king and we have such a loyal customer base now.</p>
      <p>“The feedback we get on a daily basis is phenomenal, we are just very good at keeping clients happy.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want this to be another general salon, so I have put a lot into the brand. I think that has helped us because we are recognised – we are experts.”</p>
      <p>On what the future holds for nkd, she added: “I am excited because I think we have achieved a lot in the last 10 years, but there is a lot more to achieve.”</p>
