      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/blake-lively/">Blake Lively</a> just pulled, well, another classic Blake Lively move, by deleting her entire Instagram profile, except for one movie trailer.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/01/queen-instagram-blake-lively-deletes-every-single-one-posts-confused-7511735/">did a similar stunt in May last year</a> to promote her film, A Simple Favor.</p>
      <p>But this time, she’s trying to spread the word about upcoming thriller, The Rhythm Section.</p>
      <p>Overnight, she deleted her entire profile but kept a post of the movie’s trailer that she originally posted in September.</p>

      <p>The simple caption included a tag to the Instagram account @therhythmsec, which leads to what appears to be a girl named Emilie.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the post is a mistake and she was meant to tag the official Instagram account for the movie @therhythmsectionmovie.</p>
      <p>Or maybe not.</p>

      <p>When she deleted her Instagram posts for A Simple Favor last year, she unfollowed everyone (even her hubby, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ryan-reynolds/">Ryan Reynolds</a>) and started randomly following people named Emily Nelson.</p>
      <p>(This is because her character in the film’s name was Emily).</p>
      <p>Whatever the reason for the Instagram purge, we’re gonna miss her hilarious posts, like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/blake-lively-cheekily-trolls-ryan-reynolds-sweet-happy-birthday-message-picked-good-one-10974708/">when she trolled Ryan on his birthday</a>.</p>
      <p>She posted a now-deleted adorable snap, sticking her finger up Ryan’s nose while cuddling for a selfie.</p>
      <p>The pun in the caption couldn’t have been more brilliant: ‘I picked a good one. Happy birthday @vancityreynolds,’ she wrote.</p>

      <p>Just when we thought it was impossible to love them any more.</p>
      <p>The Rhythm Section sees Blake appear as Stephanie Patrick, who tries to uncover the truth behind a plane crash which killed her family.</p>
      <p>However, there’s more to the story and during the course of her sleuthing, she becomes a skilled assassin who goes on an action-thrilled hunt to find those responsible for tearing her family apart.</p>
