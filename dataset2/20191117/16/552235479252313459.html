      <h1>The Ross Wilson Rangers psyche effect that Graeme Murty says has already boosted Ibrox kids</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox youth coach is delighted with how Wilson has acted since joining from Southampton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:24:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Graeme Murty has praised the impact <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-wilson">Ross Wilson</a> is already having on Rangers.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox reserve team coach guided his young Colts to the semi-final of the Tunnock's Caramel Wafer Cup and insists <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> have a bright future with their new sporting director at the helm.</p>
      <p>Wilson replaced departed director of football Mark Allen and is expected to work closely with first team boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard.</a></p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/graeme-murty">Murty</a> has given an insight into the work he is already doing with the youth teams and revealed the players 'psyche' has improved due to his involvement.</p>
      <p>Wilson was in attendance as the players provided peer feedback and despite a bit of worry from the young stars, Murty reckons it helped them.</p>

      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/18037835.under-20s-boss-graeme-murty-encouraged-ross-wilsons-arrival-rangers/">Evening Times:</a> “It has been really interesting working with Ross. We had an analysis session the other day and the players delivered the feedback so they analysed one another, they were split into groups, and analysed the game in this fantastic new auditorium.</p>
      <p>“Ross was sat at the back so there was a bit of trepidation there but they got past it and came into themselves to deliver good feedback.</p>
      <p>“He has been a noticeable presence around the place, he had a good meeting with the players and said that he will be at the games, they will see him and they need to know who he is.</p>
      <p>“He has had a real positive impact on their psyche, I think, and the players know that there is another person that they have to impress, which is good for us. He reinforced the message that we keep on giving them about trying and striving to be their best every single day.”</p>
