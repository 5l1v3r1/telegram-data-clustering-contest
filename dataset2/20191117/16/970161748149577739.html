      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/amy-childs/">Amy Childs</a> has made an appointment with the love doctors after reportedly signing up for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/celebs-go-dating/">Celebs Go Dating</a>.</p>
      <p>The OG <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/towie/">The Only Way Is Essex</a> star and mother-of-two recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/30/towie-star-amy-childs-secretly-split-baby-daddy-months-ago-10653123/">secretly split from the father</a> of her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/02/amy-childs-welcomes-second-baby-a-beautiful-son-7905251/">youngest child Ritchie</a> and is hoping the Celebs Go Dating team can help her find love again (and revitalise her career in the process!)</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10359357/towie-amy-childs-celebs-go-dating/">The Sun</a>: ‘It’s been a tough year for Amy and she’s been really keeping herself focused on looking after her children and staying busy with work.</p>
      <p>‘She’s been getting fit and working out and she feels great,’ they continued, ‘Celebs Go Dating could be just the thing to get her meeting someone new.’</p>
      <p>Amy will follow in a long line of Towie stars to appear on the E4 dating show, with Chloe Sims, Lauren Goodger and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gemma-collins/">Gemma Collins</a> all among the stars to have taken part since 2016.</p>

      <p>It’s not been an easy time for Amy, whose ex boyfriend and father of her daughter Polly, two, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/20/amy-childs-explains-split-from-bradley-wright-for-the-first-time-i-was-more-like-his-mum-6721039/">Bradley Wright</a> is back in prison after being found guilty of arson, handling stolen goods and dangerous driving charges.</p>
      <p>Amy recently revealed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/25/amy-childs-refusing-take-daughter-polly-see-ex-bradley-wright-prison-dont-want-10803180/">she is against taking Polly to see Bradley</a> while he is prison and claimed she ‘wasn’t shocked’ to hear he had been taken into custody again.</p>

      <p>‘I feel for Polly because she’s going to have a dad in prison,’ Amy said. ‘I don’t want it to be embarrassing for her. It’s such a small area so people will know Brad and I don’t want that for her.’</p>
      <p>She argued that Bradley hasn’t been a huge presence in Polly’s life, adding: ‘If he was an amazing dad, then yes, but as he’s only been in her life for six months I definitely wouldn’t [visit him].’</p>
      <p>Amy and Bradley began dating in 2014, when he was originally sentenced to 18 months in prison for handling stolen goods.</p>
