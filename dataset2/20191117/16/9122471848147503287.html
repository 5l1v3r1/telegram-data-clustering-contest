      <h1>Rob Gronkowski Is Making A “Big Announcement” On Tuesday Morning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:18:39+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Rob Gronkowski remains retired from the NFL. Will that continue to be the case moving forward? We could find out on Tuesday morning…</p>
      <p>The star NFL tight end, who retired following the Patriots’ Super Bowl win over the Rams, is teasing a “big announcement” this upcoming week.</p>
      <p>“What’s up Gronk Nation. I have a big announcement to make,” he said. “I can’t wait to drop it on ya’ll this upcoming Tuesday. It’s going to be fun. It’s going to be wild. It’s going to be a good time. Come check out my Instagram page, this Tuesday, 9 a.m. E.T.”</p>
      <p>Patriots fans are of course excited about the possibilities…</p>

      <p>Odds are, this is not going to be a “I’m back” announcement from Gronk. It will probably have something to do with one of his businesses.</p>
      <p>However, the Patriots are in need of an upgrade at the tight end position, and there is no bigger upgrade than Gronkowski.</p>
      <p>Patriots owner Robert Kraft reportedly told Gronkowski <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-east/new-england-patriots/robert-kraft-there-is-hope-rob-gronkowski-returns-to-patriots">to think about</a> coming back for the playoff run following his decision to retire.</p>
      <p>Tuesday at 9 a.m. E.T. could be big.</p>
