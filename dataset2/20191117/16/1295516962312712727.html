      <h1>Willem Dafoe Won't Rule Out an MCU Spider-Man Appearance</h1>

      <p>Willem Dafoe discussed whether he'd play Norman Osborn again and reprise his role as the Green Goblin from Sam Raimi's <i>Spider-Man </i>trilogy in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483313/would-willem-dafoe-ever-want-to-return-to-spider-man-for-the-mcu"><i>CinemaBlend</i></a>, Dafoe said, "Oh god. Norman Osborn was a really fun role to play. I don’t know about that, I don’t know what they’re doing. That was then, this is now. Who knows?" It's far from Dafoe putting himself forward to play the MCU's Green Goblin<i>,</i> but he doesn't completely discount the idea of hopping on his glider again either.</p>

      <p>There's still a lot of love for Raimi's trilogy, and Tom Holland has said he wants to make a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tom-holland-spider-man-film-maguire-garfield/"><i>Spider-Man </i>movie with Tobey Maguire</a>. There was also a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/petition-tobey-maguire-spider-man-far-from-home/">popular fan petition to have Maguire appear in the MCU</a>.</p>
      <p>In the MCU, fans have seen Holland's wall-crawling hero face off again the likes of Vulture and Mysterio, but the villain of the third movie is currently being kept under wraps. The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-far-from-home-multiverse/">MCU is already teasing the potential of the Multiverse</a>, meaning there's a whole host of ways Dafoe could play Osborn again. Also, it's not completely outside the realms of possibility he could play the MCU's Green Goblin and ignore the canon of Raimi's films.</p>
      <p>That being said, Dafoe recently shared his views on modern superhero movies and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/aquamans-willem-dafoe-weighs-in-on-superhero-movie-debate/">echoed Martin Scorsese's views</a> that the Hollywood landscape has changed a lot in the past 17 years. Although he's clearly fond of his time as the Green Goblin, Dafoe isn't as complimentary when it comes to the likes of the MCU.</p>
