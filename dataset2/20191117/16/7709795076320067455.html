        <b>A round-up of the rest of the news from Cheltenham on Sunday as Jonjo O'Neill jnr won the conditional jockeys' handicap hurdle on Duc De Beauchene for David Pipe, who enjoyed a double.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Pipe at the double</h3>
      <p><u><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/837899">Duc De Beauchene</a></u> got favourite-backers off to a fine start on a gloomy Sunday at Cheltenham by landing the opening <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-11-17/cheltenham/550413/cheltenham-club-conditional-jockeys-handicap-hurdle">Cheltenham Club Conditional Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle</a></b> (click for full result and FREE video replay) under Jonjo O'Neill jnr.</p>
      <p>Trained by David Pipe, the 100/30 favourite travelled strongly throughout the two miles, five furlong contest and was brought to challenge outsider Ozzy Thomas at the final flight.</p>
      <p>The winner had too many guns on the climb to the line, pulling three lengths clear of Henry Oliver's gallant runner-up, with long-time leader Electron Bleu (16/1) holding on for third. Fourth went to Demon Fou at 7/1 with Voodoo Doll (16/1) back in fifth.</p>
      <p>Pipe went on to bookend the card as 16/1 shot <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/profiles/horse/953641">Isreal Champ</a></b> won the concluding <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-11-17/cheltenham/550418/high-sheriff-of-gloucestershire-and-racing-remember-standard-open-nh-flat-race-listed">High Sheriff Of Gloucestershire And Racing Remember Standard Open NH Flat Race</a></b> under Tom Scudamore.</p>

      <h3>Clayeux dominates cross-country</h3>
      <p>There was a French-trained one-two in the <b><a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/results/2019-11-17/cheltenham/552688/glenfarclas-cross-country-handicap-chase">Glenfarclas Cross Country Handicap Chase</a></b> as <u><a href="https://www.racingpost.com/profile/horse/2527741/diesel-dallier#race-id=745217">Diesel D'Allier</a></u> beat stablemate Urgent De Gregaine.</p>

      <p>The well-backed winner was ridden by victory by Charlie Deutsch for Emmanuel Clayeux, who was well-rehearsed when comes to this unique course having saddled Urgent De Gregaine to a shock 50/1 success over the banks course at the January meeting in 2017.</p>
      <p>The six-year-old grey Diesel D'Allier, backed from double-figure odds down to 13,2, justified the strong market support with a convincing victory.</p>
      <p>Kept off the pace for most of the three-and-three-quarter-mile stamina test, Deutsch brought him into contention at the business end of proceedings.</p>
      <p>He jumped the final fence in front and galloped strongly up the hill to hold Urgent De Gregaine by four and a half lengths.</p>
      <p>Richard Hobson's Chic Name was the first of the home contingent in third spot, two and three-quarter lengths away.</p>

      <p>Clayeux said: "I wasn't sure about the course, but he jumped fluently. It was brilliant today, and he should come back in December. We will come back in December then hopefully in March.</p>
      <p>"Urgent (a winner over the course in 2017 and twice placed at the Festival) is 11 now and will be 12 next year. I hope he will run in March (Festival). It's an objective in March to stop him afterwards. I would like to finish with a winner in March and have his statue at the racecourse.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know about Diesel today, as he has less experience, even if I think that he should be a good cross-country horse in the future. He is only six and most of the cross-country horses mature at eight or nine. I hope they will both come back next month."</p>
      <p>Deutsch added: "I rode one for Emmanuel here two years ago, and it jumped brilliantly. I got a phone call off him last week, and I just said 'Yes, yes, yes' - I didn't know what it was. These French horses jump so well, and he quickened up the hill really well. He's a lovely horse."</p>
