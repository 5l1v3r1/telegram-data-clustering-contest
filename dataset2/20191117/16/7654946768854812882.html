      <p>Make sure you check out who is active and who isn’t before the early afternoon slate of games while you set your lineups:</p>
      <h3>Noteworthy Inactives</h3>
      <p><b>Matthew Stafford, QB, Detroit Lions (back)</b> – Head coach Matt Patricia confirmed that Stafford would be sidelined for at least another week with a fractured vertebrae. Jeff Driskel will get the start once again, which is bad news for Lions pass catchers Kenny Golladay, Marvin Jones and T.J. Hockenson.</p>
      <p><b>Devonta Freeman, RB, Atlanta Falcons (foot)</b> – Freeman was ruled out on Friday after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-10-devonta-freeman-saquon-barkley/">sustaining a foot sprain in Week 10 against the Saints</a>. With Freeman sidelined and Ito Smith on injured reserve, Brian Hill should see a heavy workload. He is a RB2 against the Panthers this week.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Breida, RB, San Francisco 49ers (ankle)</b> – <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-10-devonta-freeman-saquon-barkley/">Brieda reaggravated an ankle injury</a> during last week’s matchup against the Seahawks and will likely be sidelined for 1-2 weeks. Tevin Coleman has RB2 value as the unrivaled No. 1 option in the backfield. Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson will likely be involved as well.</p>
      <p><b>Jordan Howard, RB, Philadelphia Eagles (shoulder)</b> – Howard had not been cleared for contact going into this game after suffering a stinger and is not expected to play <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195929060574150657">per ESPN’s Adam Schefter</a>. The Eagles will lean on a committee of Miles Sanders, Boston Scott and new addition Jay Ajayi.</p>
      <p><b>Chase Edmonds, RB, Arizona Cardinals (hamstring)</b> – The Cardinals will sit Edmonds until after the team’s Week 12 bye as he recovers from a hamstring injury. Head coach Kliff Kingsbury declined to name a starter and said that it will be a committee between Kenyan Drake and David Johnson, now that he’s healthy. They are both RB3s going up against a stacked 49ers defense.</p>
      <p><b>Chris Thompson, RB, Washington Redskins (toe)</b> – Thompson has not played since Week 6 against Miami and will sit out on Sunday against the Jets. Adrian Peterson will continue to be the No. 1 and will share some carries with Derrius Guice, who just returned from injured reserve last week.</p>
      <p><b>Darren Sproles, RB, Philadelphia Eagles (hip flexor)</b> – Sproles was placed on injured reserve on Friday and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/darren-sproles-done-for-season-and-possibly-career-with-quad-injury/">will miss the remainder of the season</a>. He had suffered a partial tear of his hip flexor in Week 5 and returned in Week 9, only to have worsened the injury.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Thielen, WR, Minnesota Vikings (hamstring)</b> – The Vikings confirmed on that Thielen would miss another game with a lingering hamstring injury. He suffered the original injury in Week 7 on a touchdown catch in the first quarter and missed Week 8, then reinjured it in Week 9 and did not play in Week 10. Stefon Diggs has struggled in his absence and will share targets with Olabisi Johnson, Laquon Treadwell and Josh Doctson (hamstring), who was just activated off of IR on Friday.</p>
      <p><b>T.Y. Hilton, WR, Indianapolis Colts (calf)</b> – Hilton will miss another game while dealing with a calf injury that he suffered during practice. With Parris Campbell (hand) also sidelined, the Colts will lean on Zach Pascal, Chester Rogers and Marcus Johnson at receiver.</p>
      <p><b>Will Fuller, WR, Houston Texans (hamstring)</b> – Fuller will miss another game with a hamstring injury he suffered in Week 7 against the Colts. The Texans will lean on DeAndre Hopkins and Kenny Stills with Fuller sidelined.</p>
      <p><b>Alshon Jeffery, WR, Philadelphia Eagles (ankle)</b> – Jeffery was ruled out against the Patriots with an ankle injury. The Eagles are extremely lean at receiver with DeSean Jackson is also out. Nelson Agholor, Jordan Matthews and Mack Hollins will be the top options for Carson Wentz opposite the best defense in the NFL.</p>
      <p><b>A.J. Green, WR, Cincinnati Bengals (foot)</b> – Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed that Green would not play against the Raiders. It looked like Green was nearing a return, but he suffered a setback last week and has not resumed practice since. Tyler Boyd and Auden Tate will continue to see a hefty target share, especially if Alex Erickson (back) misses the game as well. The Bengals also promoted Damion Willis from their practice squad, and he could see a couple of targets in Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p><b>Parris Campbell, WR, Indianapolis Colts (hand)</b> – Campbell was ruled out on Friday and will miss his second straight game after suffering a fractured hand in Week 9 against the Steelers.</p>
      <p><b>George Kittle, TE, San Francisco 49ers (knee, ankle)</b> – Kittle is listed as doubtful and will miss his second straight game this week while he rehabs his knee and ankle injuries, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28097106/niners-george-kittle-knee-ankle-play-cardinals">per Adam Schefter</a>. Ross Dwelley and Levine Toilolo are next up at tight end.</p>
      <p><b>Austin Hooper, TE, Atlanta Falcons (knee)</b> – Hooper was ruled out on Friday after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-10-devonta-freeman-saquon-barkley/">suffering a sprained MCL in Week 10</a>. He will miss up to a month while he recovers. Luke Stocker and Jaeden Graham don’t have enough upside for a fantasy play at tight end.</p>
      <p><b>Trey Burton, TE, Chicago Bears (calf)</b> – The Bears placed Burton on injured reserve on Saturday<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-10-devonta-freeman-saquon-barkley/"> after leaving last week’s game with a calf injury</a>. He’s been mostly a non-factor for fantasy after a promising 2018 season. Ben Braunecker will start for Chicago at tight end.</p>
      <h3>Noteworthy Actives</h3>
      <p><b>Jacoby Brissett, QB, Indianapolis Colts (knee)</b> – The Colts announced that Brissett would start this week after missing Week 10 with a MCL injury. This is good news for Zach Pascal, Chester Rogers, Jack Doyle and Eric Ebron, who suffered with Brian Hoyer at the helm.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Le’Veon Bell, RB, New York Jets (ribs, knee, illness)</b> – After being a limited participant in Friday’s practice, Bell is expected to play on Sunday <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1195991716060262400">per Ian Rapoport.</a> He is listed as questionable dealing with multiple injuries and an illness but still has high upside against a bad Redskins defense.</p>
      <p><b>Ty Johnson, RB, Detroit Lions (concussion)</b> – Johnson was removed from the Lions final injury report for Week 11 after clearing the concussion protocol. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-10-devonta-freeman-saquon-barkley/">He suffered a concussion in Week 10</a> against the Bears and had to leave during the first quarter. He was a full participant in Friday’s practice and should continue to split carries with J.D. McKissic in the backfield.</p>
      <p><b>Derrius Guice, RB, Washington Redskins (knee)</b> – Guice was activated from injured reserve on Nov. 6 ahead of their Week 10 bye. The young running back has not played since Week 1 when he suffered a torn meniscus that required surgery. He should see a decent workload with Chris Thompson (toe) out, but will likely take a backseat to veteran Adrian Peterson, who has taken over for Guice.</p>
      <p><b>Jay Ajayi, RB, Philadelphia Eagles</b> – Ajayi was signed by the Eagles this week to add depth to the backfield now that Darren Sproles is out for the year. He is expected to make his 2019 debut Sunday against the Patriots <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195929060574150657">per Adam Schefter</a>. With Jordan Howard (shoulder) sidelined, Ajayi will split carries with Miles Sanders and Boston Scott.</p>
      <p><b>Amari Cooper, WR, Dallas Cowboys (knee, ankle)</b> – Cooper told the media on Friday that he is “good to go” against the Lions on Sunday. He has been playing through injuries for weeks, but gets a lovely matchup against a bad Detroit secondary this week and is a WR1.</p>
      <p><b>Marquise Brown, WR, Baltimore Ravens (ankle)</b> – Brown was limited in practice on Friday and is listed as questionable, but will suit up on Sunday against the Texans <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195953238278918145?s=20">per Adam Schefter</a>. He has high upside</p>
      <p><b>Emmanuel Sanders, WR, San Francisco 49ers (ribs)</b> – Sanders did not practice all week, but is expected to play against the Cardinals <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28097106/niners-george-kittle-knee-ankle-play-cardinals">per Adam Schefter</a>. He probably will not be at 100% and will share targets with Deebo Samuel.</p>
      <p><b>Josh Doctson, WR, Minnesota Vikings (hamstring)</b> – Doctson was activated off of injured reserve on Friday. He should add some depth to the Vikings receiving corps now that Thielen is out, but is not on anyone’s fantasy radar for now.</p>
      <p><b>Gerald Everett, TE, Los Angeles Rams (wrist)</b> – Despite the questionable tag, Everett is expected to go against the Bears. The Rams tight end has not missed a game this year and saw a whopping 12 targets last week in Pittsburgh. With Tyler Higbee (knee) banged up, Everett should have low-end TE1 value this week.</p>
      <h3>Still Questionable</h3>
      <p><b>Damien Williams, RB, Kansas City Chiefs (personal)</b> – Head coach Andy Reid said Williams should travel with the team to Mexico City to take on the Chargers. If he plays, he will be a high-end RB2. Darrel Williams and LeSean McCoy would be next up if he misses time.</p>
      <p><b>David Montgomery, RB, Chicago Bears (ankle)</b> – Montgomery was a limited participant in Friday’s practice and will be a game-time decision for Sunday’s game against the Rams. If he sits, Tarik Cohen would see more rushes, as well as Ryan Nall.</p>
      <p><b>Tyler Higbee, TE, Los Angeles Rams (knee)</b> – Higbee is listed as questionable going into Sunday night’s matchup against the Bears. He practiced on Friday and has a good chance to play, but will be behind Gerald Everett (wrist), who is expected to play.</p>
