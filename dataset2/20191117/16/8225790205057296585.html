      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A flash flood watch has been issued for all Hawaiian islands as two weather systems combine to increase the threat of heavy rain and thunderstorms.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service in Honolulu said the flash flood watch will be in effect through 6 p.m. Monday.</p>
      <p>A trough of low pressure that moved in from the east will linger over the state through Monday, while an upper level disturbance moves overhead.</p>
      <p>The combination of the two will produce very unstable conditions that could produce heavy rain and flash flooding.</p>
      <p>Kauai has already seen an extended period of heavy rain since Saturday night, and was under a flash flood warning from Saturday night through early Sunday afternoon, when the warning was finally canceled.</p>
      <p>A flash flood watch means that conditions are favorable for flash flooding to occur. Monitor the forecasts and be prepared to take action if a flash flood warning is issued. Do not try to cross fast-flowing water in your vehicle or on foot.</p>
