      <h1>Police arrest fan after Wycombe goalkeeper complains of homophobic abuse at Tranmere game</h1>
      <h2>Two more individuals are being investigated following the incident at Prenton Park on Sunday afternoon as Wycombe beat Tranmere in League One</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:45:35+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Whittell</a></address>
      <p>The FA are investigating after Wycombe goalkeeper Ryan Allsop made a complaint about the use of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/homophobia-in-football">homophobic language</a> from supporters at Tranmere Rovers.</p>
      <p>Police are believed to have made one arrest and are investigating two other individuals after the incident at Prenton Park.</p>
      <p>Allsop made the complaint at half-time to match referee John Busby who involved Merseyside Police during a game that was screened live on television.</p>
      <p>Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth only discovered the incident had taken place at full time but praised his players for their response.</p>
      <p>Ainsworth said: “That’s the first I’ve heard of it. But if that’s the case, there are some stupid idiots about, whether it’s racism or this, and we have to stamp it out.</p>

      <p>“You’ve got to credit the players for taking it seriously and reporting it.”</p>
      <p>The FA confirmed they are investigating the incident and awaiting a report from referee Busby before deciding what course to take.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: “We are awaiting the report and will be seeking observations from all the parties involved.”</p>
      <p>But Tranmere have promised an investigation and confirmed they will take action against supporters found guilty of any wrong doing.</p>
      <p>Boss Micky Mellon said: “Obviously it is being dealt with properly. At the moment, we feel everything is being done that is necessary.</p>
      <p>“It will play out the way people have to deal with it and I am sure they will deal with it because Tranmere is a good football club.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know what’s been said, I wasn’t there. I can’t comment on something I haven’t heard or seen but the club will deal with it.”</p>
      <p>While racism at football matches has come under an increasing spotlight in recent months, reported cases of homophobic abuse are far less common.</p>
      <p>But the FA has made tackling homophobia a priority, as part of its inclusion and anti-discrimination policies.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, police and the FA investigated claims that then Macclesfield boss Sol Campbell was the subject of homophobic abuse during his team’s game at Cheltenham although no further action was taken.</p>
