      <h1>Arsenal could have interest in emerging South American talent – Gunners official travels for tournament</h1>

      <p>We’ve said it before now, scouting young talent is big business for the elite level sides in Europe.</p>
      <p>Finding and securing the best young talent from the world over is as essential as big-money signings these days.</p>
      <p>That desire to scout the world’s best talent has led the big sides to the Tenerife Tournament and Arsenal were among them.</p>
      <p>The event is for South American teams to prepare for the 2020 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament, with Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the United States all competing.</p>
      <p>Portuguese newspaper <a href="https://www.record.pt/">Record</a> report that several teams have scouts in attendance for the tournament, which is taking place in Gran Canaria, and Arsenal are among them.</p>
      <p>There’s no mention of who the Gunners may have been scouting, although there’s every chance they’re keeping an eye on one of their own.</p>

      <p>Arsenal striker Gabriel Martinelli is part of the Brazil squad for the tournament so it would make sense to keep an eye on him.</p>
      <p>Record, though, suggest it might just be a case of transfer opportunism.</p>
      <p>Accreditation was open for the event, and the chance to see Brazil vs Argentina was too tempting to turn down, especially if you’re Arsenal.</p>
