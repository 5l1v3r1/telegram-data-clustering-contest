      <p>Valencia - World champion <b>Marc Marquez</b> clinched his 12th MotoGP victory of the season in Sunday's final race in Valencia ahead of French rookie <b>Fabio Quartararo</b>.</p>
      <p>Marquez, who secured his sixth premier category title last month, finished over a second clear of pole-sitter Quartararo who came second for the fifth time in his debut campaign.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard made a poor start from second place on the grid but steadily picked off his rivals one by one to win at Valencia for just the second time in his career.</p>
      <p>"It's been a difficult weekend because we've tried new things," said Marquez, who took his 56th MotoGP win. "It's a perfect season which will be difficult to repeat."</p>
      <p>Australian's Jack Miller claimed third while triple MotoGP champion Jorge Lorenzo bid farewell to the sport with a 13th-place finish in his final race. </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Spaniard announced his decision to retire on Thursday. He could be replaced by Marquez's younger brother and Moto2 champion Alex at Honda next season.</p>
      <p>Quartararo again fell just short in his bid to become the first Frenchman to win a MotoGP race since 1999, but the 20-year-old was delighted with his first season among the elite.</p>
      <p>"Nobody could have imagined at the start of the season that I would have six pole positions and seven podiums. It's incredible to finish the season in this way," said Quartararo, who ended fifth in the overall standings.</p>
      <p>British rider Cal Crutchlow and Frenchman Johann Zarco, LCR Honda team-mates also with thoughts of an upgrade next year, crashed out prematurely Sunday.</p>
      <p>Crutchlow went down before Zarco, cut loose by KTM earlier this season, was sent skidding by 19-year-old Spanish debutant Iker Lecuona who followed the Frenchman to the deck.</p>
      <p>Zarco was examined by on-site medics before gingerly limping back to his team stable.</p>
      <p>Lecuona was filling in for the KTM Tech team in place of Miguel Oliveira, who was injured in the last race in Australia.</p>
      <p>Valentino Rossi, showing no signs of wanting to retire at the age of 40, rounded out his season by coming eighth. The Italian, a seven-time MotoGP champion, finished seventh overall.</p>
      <p>Compatriot Andrea Dovizioso, second in the championship behind Marquez for the third year running, took fourth at the Ricardo Tormo circuit.</p>
      <p>South Africa's <b>Brad Binder</b> concluded the Moto2 season with his third successive win to finish runner-up. He will also make the step up to the top level with KTM next year. </p>
      <p>Valencia native Sergio Garcia, 16, won for the first time in Moto3 as he pipped Italy's Andrea Migno to the line in a race shortened after a series of crashes. </p>
