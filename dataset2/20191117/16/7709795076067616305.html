      <p>Dan Biggar kicked 20 points to steer <b>Northampton</b> to an impressive 25-14 victory over <b>Lyon</b> in their Heineken Champions Cup opener at Franklin's Gardens.</p>
      <p>Back from World Cup duties for Wales, it was Biggar's first appearance for Saints this season and his six penalties and the conversion of Rory Hutchinson's try helped his side to a hard-fought success.</p>
      <p>Replacement Thibaut Regard scored two tries for Lyon, both of which Jonathan Wisniewski converted.</p>
      <p>This season, Lyon have won eight of the opening nine league games to lead the Top 14 but they were no match for the home side, who also saw England World Cup squad members Courtney Lawes, Piers Francis and Lewis Ludlam return to the fray.</p>
      <p><b>Connacht</b> marked their return to Champions Cup rugby in memorable style with a terrific 23-20 victory over <b>Montpellier</b> at the Sportsground.</p>
      <p>Tries from Paul Boyle, stand-in captain Tom McCartney and Caolin Blade, with the rest of the points kicked by Jack Carty and Conor Fitzgerald, saw the westerners prevail in their first European top tier game in three seasons.</p>
      <p>Montpellier scored tries through Aaron Cruden and Anthony Bouthier, while captain Benoit Paillaugue added two penalties, but injury-depleted Connacht, who led 13-10 at half-time, were worthy winners in a performance of massive character.</p>
