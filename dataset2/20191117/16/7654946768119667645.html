      <p>President Trump unexpectedly came to Joe Biden’s defense on Sunday — but only to say he was “somewhat” better than a rabid dog.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Chairman, Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a ‘rabid dog,'” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196080086686011398">Trump tweeted</a> in an apparent direct message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, following the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/north-korea-calls-biden-a-rabid-dog-who-should-be-beaten-to-death-with-a-stick/">country’s shocking attack</a> that also said Biden should be “beaten to death with a stick.”</p>
      <p>“He is actually somewhat better than that,” Trump wrote of the Democratic frontrunner, who has been leading in national polls but is lagging behind South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/buttigieg-dominates-iowa-field-in-new-cnn-poll/">latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll</a>.</p>
      <p>The commander in chief then used his tweet to push the fact that he has come further than any previous president in creating dialogue over <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/06/us-north-korea-break-of-nuclear-talks-in-sweden-after-one-day/">nuclear weapons with the hostile nation</a>.</p>
      <p>“I am the only one who can get you where you have to be. You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!” Trump tweeted.</p>
