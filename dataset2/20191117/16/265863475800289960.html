      <p>Another commenter wrote: ‘Why did your assistant end the live? She could have just flipped the camera back! 🗣’</p>
      <p>Someone told Porsha: ‘That’s an unexpected bunch of enthusiasm 😃 she’s a bit weird though ~7’</p>

      <p>A fan asked the RHOA star: ‘Why do you look sad in your eyes? I would love to see your afro! Your real hair! Please don’t straighten you daughters hair or do plastic surgery in her nose!’</p>
      <p>Someone responded to the commenter above: ‘What has happened to the World today where strangers think it’s okay to tell others what to do with their lives. Go as far as telling you what to do with your kids. It would bring so much peace and happiness when strangers focus on Self. BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE FOR YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES.. Let people live their own lives their way.. We all get to call the shots about our lives. PERIOD.’</p>
