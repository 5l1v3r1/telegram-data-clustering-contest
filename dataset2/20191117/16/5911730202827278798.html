      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:57:38+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Haworth, ABC NEWS</a></address>
      <p>A small boy who wandered onto railroad tracks has been struck and killed by an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/amtrak">Amtrak</a> train.</p>
      <p>The accident occurred at about 4:19 p.m. on the Union Pacific tracks in Santa Clara, California when the “very young minor” somehow got onto the railroad tracks and was hit, according to <a href="https://abc7news.com/child-hit-killed-by-amtrak-train-in-santa-clara/5702528/">ABC's San Francisco station KGO-TV</a> .</p>
      <p>The Santa Clara Police and Fire departments are on the scene and currently conducting an investigation alongside Amtrak Police as to how and why the boy was on the tracks when he was. Police stress that this was an accident and not a deliberate act.</p>
