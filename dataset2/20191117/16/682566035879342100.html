      <p>Lucknow - <b>Afghanistan</b> skipper Rashid Khan won the toss and elected to bat first in the third and deciding <b>Twenty20 </b>international against <b>West Indies</b> in Lucknow in Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Afghans bounced back to win the last game by 41 runs on Saturday to level the three-match series at 1-1 with Karim Janat taking five wickets and scoring 26 runs.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan, who play their home games in India since 2015 due to security issues back home, have retained their winning XI.</p>
      <p>"We would like to bat first. We did it well last game and want to repeat that today," Rashid said at the toss.</p>
      <p>"Anything in the 150-160 range is what we were looking for yesterday but on this kind of a track 145-plus scores is also tricky."</p>
      <p>The Kieron Pollard-led West Indies made three changes to their starting line-up with fit-again Lendl Simmons, Shai Hope and Khary Pierre making the cut.</p>
      <p>Hope comes straight in to the XI after being added to the squad as cover for injured Denesh Ramdin.</p>
      <p>"We always come with certain processes but just didn't work out well yesterday," said Pollard. "Hope to learn from the past and correct our mistakes."</p>
