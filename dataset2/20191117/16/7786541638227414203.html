      <p><b>ZAGREB, CroatiaÂ (AP)</b> - A Croatian hospital says a migrant is fighting for his life after being shot Friday by police.</p>
      <p>Doctors in the Croatian port of Rijeka said Sunday the unidentified migrant suffered multiple bullet wounds to his chest.</p>
      <p>Croatian police have said they fired shots at a group of migrants Friday "to protect Croatia's borders."</p>
      <p>Police say they've sent a team to investigate the circumstances of the shooting, which took place at the Gorski Kotar mountains, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the border with Bosnia.</p>
      <p>Rights groups have accused Croatian authorities of using excessive force against migrants illegally entering from Bosnia and Serbia. Croatia has repeatedly denied the charges.</p>
      <p>Thousands of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia have become stuck in the Balkans while trying to reach Western Europe.</p>
