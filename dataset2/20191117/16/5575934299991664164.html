      <p>Marriage doesn’t always mean a joint checking account these days. In fact, many Americans are choosing to keep finances separate after tying the knot.</p>
      <p>In an Insider and Morning Consult survey of about 2,000 Americans on their financial habits for the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/the-state-of-our-money">State of Our Money</a> series, one question asked married people whether they kept separate or combined accounts. It was not specified whether respondents were in same or different-sex marriages.</p>
      <p>The data found that money in marriage might be changing when when compared to older generations. Overall, 64% of all married people had combined their finances. About 37% of married millennials kept their finances separate from their partner’s, as did about 36% of Gen Xers.</p>
      <p>However, only 27% of baby boomers did the same.</p>
      <p>The increase in the number of younger Americans who are keeping finances separate hints at just one of the ways marriage and money have changed since the boomers’ generation.</p>
      <h3>Deciding whether to combine finances is a personal choice</h3>
      <p>For some couples, keeping finances separate just means that there’s one less source of stress in the relationship. Brandon of the Mad Fientist, 37, and his wife Jill told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/why-keeping-finances-separate-crucial-happy-marriage-2017-1">Business Insider’s Tanza Loudenback</a> that they kept their finances separate for exactly this reason. Jill said, “I think our marriage would have been doomed if we had everything in a joint account. I think that would have caused a lot of arguments.”</p>
      <p>Millennials and Gen Xers are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/money-stress-millennial-gen-x-relationships-2019-10">already stressed about money</a> within their relationships – about 62% of millennials and 56% of Gen Xers report that money adds stress to their relationship. Sixty-four per cent of boomers say that money isn’t a source of stress in their marriage or relationship.</p>
      <p>However, joint accounts make it easy to keep on top of shared financial goals, share in responsibility, and maintain transparency.</p>
      <p>Financial therapist Amanda Clayman told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/reasons-couples-should-combine-finances-according-to-experts-2019-10">Business Insider contributor Caroline Lupini</a> that while separate accounts limit vulnerability, it requires extra work. “With everything separate, there is no structural requirement that you communicate and coordinate,” she said. “You’re less flexible as a team to deal with changes.”</p>
      <p>No matter which setup works for your household, you’ll want to be on the same page about money. Financial planner Christine Centeno <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/make-a-spreadsheet-to-get-on-the-same-page-money-2019-8">previously told Business Insider</a> that her favourite sign of couples who are financially in sync is a simple spreadsheet.</p>
      <p>“They have both gone through this spreadsheet,” she said. “They have all the numbers and they’re like, ‘here’s what we want to do.'”</p>
