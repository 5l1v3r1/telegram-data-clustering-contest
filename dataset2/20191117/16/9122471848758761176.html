      <h1>College Football Fans Are Furious With CBS Announcer Gary Danielson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:04:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>College football fans are furious with CBS analyst Gary Danielson for how he insensitively handled the Georgia photographer’s scary injury on the sideline of Saturday’s game at Auburn.</p>
      <p>A Bulldogs photographer was knocked out on the sideline late in the first half of Saturday afternoon’s game at Auburn. The female journalist was down, motionless, for several minutes. She was eventually stretchered off the field and taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the Georgia photographer has since been released from the hospital. She <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/georgia-issues-promising-update-on-injured-photographer">appears to be OK</a>.</p>
      <p>Danielson, meanwhile, continues to get criticized for how he handled everything.</p>

      <p>Danielson first did not realize that it was a photographer who was knocked out. He thought it was a player. Danielson then laughed when Brad Nessler mentioned that the photographer was not getting up. Finally, he thought it was a man, not a woman.</p>
      <p>The longtime CBS analyst could not have handled it worse.</p>
      <p>“Gary Danielson has called every single element of this collision and injury incorrectly,” longtime college football writer Pat Forde tweeted, summing it up best.</p>

      <p>The photographer is thankfully OK, which is most important, but CBS cannot be happy with how its lead SEC analyst handled such a frightening moment.</p>
