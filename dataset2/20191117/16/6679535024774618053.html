      <p>A landslide was reported on the Bodi Mettu ghat road connecting to Munnar, in the district around 2 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
      <p>As heavy rains pounded the Bodi and Munnar hills in the past few days, a portion of loose soil slipped on the road near Puliyuthu falls and the 11th hairpin bend.</p>
      <p>Traffic was suspended for about nine hours due to this. The Kurangani police stopped vehicles bound for Munnar at the Munthal checkpost and the vehicles from Kerala were stopped at Bodi Mettu checkpost.</p>
      <p>The highway authorities cleared the landslide on Sunday morning, after which traffic was restored. As it was Sunday, the usual jeep traffic carrying workers to the cardamom estates was few in numbers.</p>
