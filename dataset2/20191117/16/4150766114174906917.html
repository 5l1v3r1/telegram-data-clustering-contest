      <h1>Phnom Penh International Airport wins award as passenger traffic soars</h1>

      <p>The Phnom Penh International Airport has been awarded Best Asia Pacific Regional Airport 2019 for its sustained high growth in passenger traffic in recent years.</p>
      <p>The award was presented by the Capa Centre for Aviation (Capa) – a world-leading and trusted organisation that provides market intelligence to the aviation and travel industry – at the Capa Asia Aviation Summit, which was held in Singapore on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Capa said it chose Phnom Penh International Airport for adopting an innovative strategy that has led to passenger traffic increasing more than 25 per cent over the 2017-2018 period and 15 per cent between the first and third quarters of this year.</p>
      <p>It noted the very rapid completion of runway projects, which “expand the potential for new long-haul services” and lauded the airport’s contribution to the Kingdom’s gross domestic product and job creation.</p>
      <p>Capa also gave a nod to Cambodia’s two other international airports in Siem Reap and Preah Sihanouk provinces.</p>
      <p>Its chairman emeritus Peter Harbison said: “Over the three years from 2015 to 2018, Phnom Penh [International] Airport grew its passenger volume by 50 per cent, requiring enormous adjustments to its operating regime.</p>
      <p>“At the same time, cargo payload capacity has almost doubled. The expansion was the result of a well-coordinated programme of business development,” he said.</p>
      <p>The acronym Capa comes from the organisation’s former name – the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation Pty Ltd.</p>
      <p>Cambodia Airports CEO Alain Brun said the Phnom Penh International Airport benefits from an ability to easily adapt and respond to its customers’ needs, which the award demonstrates.</p>
      <p>“This accolade is a testament to the relevance of the airport’s public-private partnership model, powered by Vinci Airports [SAS], under which Phnom Penh International Airport has been successfully developed over the last 25 years.</p>
      <p>“Our model warrants long-term vision, reliability and continuous investments, which translate into solid passenger growth – from 600,000 to six million by the end of 2019, significant infrastructure projects and operational efficiency,” he said.</p>
      <p>Cambodia Association of Travel Agents president Chhay Sivlin said the award reflects the airport’s abilities to expand and innovate in response to the sharp increase in tourist arrivals every year.</p>
      <p>“The award will further attract more tourists into the country. However, the airport has to make sure it provides first-rate service to its passengers.</p>
      <p>More airlines will seek to operate here as we continue to face a shortage of short- and long-haul direct flights to the region and around the globe,” she said.</p>
      <p>Last year, the combined number of passengers passing through the Kingdom’s international airports totalled 10.5 million, a 20 per cent increase from 2017, data from Cambodia Airports indicated.</p>
      <p>Some 5.4 million passengers passed through the Phnom Penh International Airport and 4.48 million through Siem Reap International Airport, the data said. Both airports handled 4.2 million passengers in 2017.</p>
      <p>From a low base but experiencing nearly triple-digit growth, Sihanoukville International Airport handled more than 650,000 passengers, from 2017’s 338,000.</p>
      <p>The three airports serve at least 55 international destinations and welcome 700 regular flights per week.</p>
