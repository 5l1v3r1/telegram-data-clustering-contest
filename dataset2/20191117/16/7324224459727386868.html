      <p>Hosted by Free Radio’s weekend breakfast show presenters Fleur East and Greg Burns, the sold-out event last night featured a crowd of 15,000 music fans all going crazy for some of their favourite artists.</p>
      <p>Starring The Script, Lewis Capaldi, Rita Ora and a host of other stars, the annual event was a huge hit in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night Lewis Capaldi was his usual hilarious and charming self as he bantered with the crowd while he played songs from his chart-topping debut album.</p>
      <p>Rita Ora entertained the packed arena in a colourful abstract print pyjama suit, complete with matching visor and red slouch knee-high boots, while Craig David had everyone up on their feet as he played some of his biggest hits and throwbacks.</p>
      <p>Closing the night were The Script, who delivered a show-stopping performance, with the huge audience all singing along to their best-known songs.</p>
      <p>Completing the huge line-up were the amazing Sigala, Jax Jones, John Newman, Becky Hill and Raye.</p>
      <p>Presenter Fleur East also wowed the crowd performing her hit Sax, as well as debuting her brand new single Size.</p>
      <p>She said: “Birmingham you’re an amazing crowd. Thank you so much.”</p>

      <p>He also chatted to Craig David, and asked him about what he still enjoyed after being in the music industry for more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>He said: That I go on stage and I just feel that buzz all the time. When I’m in the studio I’m excited because I’ve created something that someone has never heard before and you are the only one in the whole world who has this, and you get excited before you release it.”</p>
      <p>Free Radio Hits Live will be returning to Birmingham next year on November 21.</p>
