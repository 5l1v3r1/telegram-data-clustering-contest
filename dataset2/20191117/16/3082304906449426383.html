        <b>The latest word around the rumour mill is that Juventus ace Cristiano Ronaldo has urged his club to beat Real Madrid to the signing of Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is <i>AS</i> who reports via <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205580/Real-Madrid-Transfer-News-Man-Utd-Cristiano-Ronaldo-Paul-Pogba-Zinedine-Zidane-Latest"><i>Express</i></a> that Ronaldo has “recommended” Pogba to Juventus executives.</p>
      <p>However, one might feel that the 2018 FIFA World Cup winner does not require many recommendations at Juventus, as he has already played for them before.</p>
      <p>Ex-Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson offloaded him to the <i>Bianconeri</i> in 2012, and he remained with them for four seasons before breaking Gareth Bale’s world-record transfer fee to return to the Ole Trafford.</p>
      <p><i>AS</i> claim that Juventus could table a “lucrative” offer for Pogba, by plotting to exchange right-back Danilo, midfielders Emre Can and/or Sami Khedira, or attackers Paulo Dybala or Mario Mandzukic for the 26-year-old.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and co are short of attackers, which means that they might find it hard to resist a player-plus-cash deal wich involves either Dybala or Mandzukic.</p>
      <p>During the summer, Pogba himself famously claimed that he is “ready” to leave the Old Trafford after spending three eventful seasons at the club.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has also spoken about joining Real Madrid in what seems to be a “dream move” for him, but he has not ruled out a return to Juventus either.</p>
