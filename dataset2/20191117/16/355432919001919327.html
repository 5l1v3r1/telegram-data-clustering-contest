      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> responded to North Korea’s criticism of <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> on Sunday, saying the 2020 Democratic White House hopeful “may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a ‘rabid dog.’”</p>
      <p>The president in a tweet described Biden as “somewhat better than that.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. Chairman, Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow, but he is not a ‘rabid dog,’” Trump tweeted.</p>
      <p>“He is actually somewhat better than that, but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be," he added. "You should act quickly, get the deal done. See you soon!”</p>

      <p>North Korea’s state-run media <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470597-north-korea-on-biden-a-rabid-dog-that-needs-to-be-put-down">attacked</a> the former vice president last Friday, calling him “a rabid dog” that needs to be "beaten to death."</p>
      <p>“It was the last-ditch efforts of the rabid dog expediting his death,” KCNA said in a commentary. “Rabid dogs like Baiden [sic] can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late.”</p>
      <p>Biden, a longtime critic of North Korea, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470715-biden-responds-to-north-korea-i-wear-their-insults-as-a-badge-of-honor">answered</a> by saying he wears North Korea’s insults of him “as a badge of honor.”</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been working with North Korea on a denuclearization deal, but negotiations have stalled in recent months.</p>
      <p>North Korea has given the U.S. an end-of-the-year deadline on making a deal.</p>
