      <p>Colin Kaepernick held his workout for NFL teams to come check him out at. Since then, Stephen A. Smith took to the internet to release a video of him commenting on Kaepernick, saying he doesn’t think Kaepernick really wants to play in the NFL. Kaepernick’s friend and former teammate Eric Reid responded back to the video.</p>
      <p>After seeing Smith’s video, Reid said Smith was “tap dancing for the NFL,” which led Smith to respond with a barrage of tweets.</p>
      <p>Reid responded by saying “Malcolm X said, “If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.” You embody this quote. You, Malcolm Jenkins, and Jay-Z prance around doing the NFL’s bidding to try 2 burry Colin. I stand 4 truth &amp; justice above all else. You r mistaken by thinking that because u or anybody is black that you are spared from my criticism especially when you’ve been so blatantly on the NFL’s side in corrupting their own process to hinder Colin’s employment.”</p>
