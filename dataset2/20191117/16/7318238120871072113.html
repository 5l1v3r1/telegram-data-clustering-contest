      <p>Indian schoolchildren took part in protests on Sunday (November 17) against poor air quality, after schools closed to protect the health of students.</p>
      <p>Schools in New Delhi will reopen on Monday (November 18) after a two-day shutdown caused by pollution levels, but air quality is likely to remain "very poor," a notch below the "severe" rating.</p>
      <p>Toxic smog that surrounds the city has plunged air quality into the "severe" category several days this month, as data showed that a promise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to eliminate burning of crop stubble in neighboring states has not worked.</p>
