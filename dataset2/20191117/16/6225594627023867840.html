        <b>Facebook is adding three new tools to help nonprofits fundraise across its platforms including a new donation button on Instagram and a donate sticker for Facebook Stories.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://wersm.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a> has long been a fundraising-friendly platform for nonprofits. And now the company is adding three new tools to help them raise even more money.</p>
      <p>Facebook is finally adding a donate sticker for Stories. The format has grown in popularity with nonprofits as it allows better storytelling and promotion of behind-the-scene content. Facebook has now decided to replicate the success of the Instagram donation sticker on Instagram on its own version of Stories.</p>

      <p>Facebook is also extending its gaming charity live streams to more of its Level Up gamers. They’ll be able to select a cause of their choice and request that their viewers donate money as they watch them game live. The streamer can set a goal amount, and a notification will pop up in the chat as people donate.</p>
      <p>Finally, <a href="https://wersm.com/category/other/instagram">Instagram</a> will soon offer a more permanent way to fundraise with a “Donate” button right on the profile of nonprofits. Located next to the contact  tab, the new button will provide permanent access to fundraising.</p>
