      <p>ARKADELPHIA, Ark. (AP) — Two Arkansas college chemistry professors have been <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/two-henderson-chemistry-professors-arrested-for-making-meth">arrested on charges of making meth</a>, in an apparent <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/chemistry-professor-arrested-on-meth-charges-once-called-hendersons-heisenberg">case of life imitating art</a>.</p>
      <p>The Clark County sheriff’s office says<a href="https://twitter.com/hendersonstateu?lang=en"> Henderson State University</a> professors Terry David Bateman and Bradley Allen Rowland were arrested Friday on charges of manufacturing methamphetamine and using drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t clear if they remained in jail Sunday, and a jail official said he couldn’t give out that information.</p>
      <p>Tina Hall, a spokeswoman for the Arkadelphia-based school, says Bateman and Rowland have been on administrative leave since Oct. 11. She says three days earlier, police investigated a report of a chemical odor in the campus science center. She says the building reopened Oct. 29 after a company filtered the air.</p>
      <p>The arrests drew comparisons to the central character in the hit TV series “Breaking Bad,” in which a high school chemistry teacher began making methamphetamine.</p>
