      <h1>Only 8 of 25 NFL Teams Were In Attendance For Colin Kaepernick’s Workout After Venue Change</h1>

      <p>Free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick held a workout on Saturday for NFL teams, but there were a lot less teams than originally expected on hand to watch him.</p>
      <p>There was confirmed to be at least 25 teams scheduled to be present, but once Kaepernick moved the venue, a lot of those teams ended up being no-shows. So only eight teams attended, according to Vaughn McClure of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28095462/colin-kaepernick-throws-passes-40-minutes-workout-urges-nfl-stop-running">ESPN.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Those eight teams were the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, Kansas City Chiefs, New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Tennessee Titans and Washington Redskins.</p>
      <p>The Falcons have seen Matt Ryan go down with an injury as well as Detroit dealing with Matt Stafford having broken bones in his back. Patrick Mahomes has returned from his injury, but you can never be to sure after a dislocated knee cap.</p>
      <p>The Jets have seen Sam Darnold go down to injury as well as just playing badly overall, while Carson Wentz has shown to have injury problems with Philly.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick gave a full statement following the workout:</p>
      <blockquote>“Let me start by saying I appreciate y’all coming out. That means a lot to me. Our biggest thing with everything today was making sure we had transparency in what was going on. We weren’t getting that elsewhere, so we came out here. It’s important y’all are here.<br/><br/>“I been ready for three years, I’ve been denied for three years. We all know why I came out here and showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. We are waiting for the 32 owners, 32 teams and Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running — stop running from the truth, stop running from the people. We are out here, we ready to play. We are ready to go anywhere. My agent Jeff Nalley is ready to talk to any team. I will interview with any team at any time. I been ready, I’m staying ready and I continue to be ready.”</blockquote>

      <p>The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback drew some positive reviews, with one scout commenting on his arm strength.</p>
      <p>“After today’s workout in Atlanta, an NFL executive at Colin Kaepernick’s throwing session said his arm talent is ‘elite’ and is the same as when he came out of college. He said that Kaepernick threw the ball well,” Schefter wrote.</p>
