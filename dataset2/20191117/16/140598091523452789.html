      <h1>Quality of refereeing substandard for professional game, says Casey Stoney after Manchester United defeat by Chelsea</h1>

      <p>Casey Stoney, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/15/casey-stoney-exclusive-interview-man-utd-manager-showing-emotions/">the head coach of Manchester United women</a>, has accused referees of failing to keep pace with the professionalisation of women’s football and called on the Football Association to urgently address the standard of Super League officiating.</p>
      <p>After seeing her United team lose 1-0 to a hugely controversial penalty, Stoney was joined by Chelsea and England striker Beth England in strongly criticising the performance of referee Jack Packman, who was a third replacement after two other officials pulled out through tonsillitis and injury.</p>
      <p>“The league needs to look at it,” said England, who referenced two studs-up tackles. “It’s not OK. Where is the protection for the players? The decisions, for me, were embarrassing. We want to put in good performances and, when referees are giving bad decisions that are killing the game, it's hard. I hope that they will watch the game and look at how badly they did. I thought they were appalling today.”</p>
      <p>The frustrations centred on two incidents. United defender Amy Turner had already been booked in the first half when she was penalised for a tackle that her team-mates were convinced was not a foul. Packman awarded a free-kick but then instead booked Abbie McManus, leaving Chelsea aggrieved that Turner was not dismissed for a second yellow card. Then, in the decisive moment of the match during the second half, Packman ruled that Millie Turner had upended Fran Kirby and gave a penalty. Maren Mjelde duly stepped up to score the winning goal, which put Chelsea back ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Women’s Super League table.</p>
      <p>Stoney took her time before speaking to the media - she even first oversaw some shuttle runs among a group of United players - but remained visibly seething about the officiating. Her team had actually created the best chances in the first-half and were then also desperately unlucky not to equalise in the closing minutes when Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger tipped Ella Toone’s volley onto the crossbar. The ball then bounced off Berger’s back and was clearly close to crossing the line before being cleared. Berger had herself earlier required extensive treatment and assessment following a head injury when she dived at the feet of Lauren James. </p>

      <p>“I’ll get fined if I said what I want to say,” said Stoney. “We are a professional game. We have to address the level of refereeing. We work hard week in, week out. My players are honest, hard-working, driven - they deserve better than that. It was a 90-minute poor performance. He [Packman] has apologised but that’s too late.”</p>
      <p>Of the decisive penalty, Stoney said: “The only person in the ground who saw it as a penalty is the referee. Give yourself time to make a big decision. It’s not fair on the players when their staff are turning around and going, ‘It’s never a penalty’. We all make mistakes - I make mistakes, my players make mistakes - but it’s a big one.” Both Stoney and England stressed that they did not see Packman’s performance as an isolated issue on a day when an attendance of 4,790 at the Kingsmeadow Stadium was the highest in Super League history outside of a main club ground.</p>
      <p>“I’m annoyed I have to talk about the poor officiating when we should be talking about the crowds, the quality of the game, the speed of the game, the outstanding play,” said Stoney. “The game has professionalised and the officiating hasn’t moved forward in my opinion.”</p>
      <p>Kirsty Hanson, Lauren James and Jackie Groenen had all had chances to put Manchester United into a first-half lead but Chelsea did assume control either side of half-time. Kirby had only just been substituted on when her run provoked the challenge for Chelsea’s penalty. At the end of a week that has also seen Chelsea sign Australia international and Ballon d’Or nominee Sam Kerr, manager Emma Hayes particularly highlighted the influence of Wales international Sophie Ingle’s defensive midfield performance. “She doesn’t get the recognition because she is not English but should be one of the first names on Phil Neville’s list for the Olympics,” said Hayes.   </p>
