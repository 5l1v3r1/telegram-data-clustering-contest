      <p>It is thought the chef then got a bus towards Whitburn, but it isn't known where he get off and loved ones hadn't seen him since.</p>
      <p>His family <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4957108/armadale-jonathon-donaldson-online-appeal-search-party/">launched a search party</a> to try and trace him.</p>
      <p>But today police confirmed they had found a body.</p>
      <p>The body has not been formally identified but Jonathon's family have been made aware.</p>
      <p>We previously told how the sister of Jonathon had shared a heartfelt plea for her brother to return home.</p>
      <p>His sister Cassandra wrote on Facebook: "If anyone sees my brother Johny Donaldson can you please contact the family or police.</p>
      <p>"He is missing and not been in touch with anyone since Monday and nobody has seen him."</p>
      <p>She added: "This is so heartbreaking for myself and my family and we are extremely concerned for his welfare."</p>
      <p>It is understood that an eyewitness reported seeing Jonathon leaving the hotel before boarding a bus.</p>
      <p>Casandra previously said: "We have received information from eyewitnesses to say Johny was seen leaving the Oatridge Hotel in Uphall to go to the Scotmid situated across the road to buy a scratch card.</p>
      <p>"He was then boarding a number 600 bus around 4:15pm on November 11th that goes towards Whitburn in the West Lothian area.</p>
      <p>"We do not know at present what stop he got off at."</p>
