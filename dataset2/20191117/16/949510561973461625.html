      <p>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Josh Allen tied a career high with three touchdown passes and ran for another score Sunday to help the Buffalo Bills complete a season sweep of the Miami Dolphins by winning 37-20.</p>
      <p>Allen’s TD tosses covered 40 and 9 yards to John Brown, and 23 yards to Dawson Knox. Allen also scored on an 8-yard run, and he had a 36-yard run to set up a field goal.</p>
      <p>Miami couldn’t keep up against Buffalo’s smothering defense. The Bills totaled a season-high seven sacks and allowed only 23 yards rushing.</p>
      <p>The victory gave the Bills (7-3) their best 10-game record since 1999, but they won for only the second time in the past four games.</p>
      <p>Miami (2-8) lost to Buffalo for the fourth time in the past five meetings.</p>
      <p>Allen went 21 for 33 for 256 yards without a sack or turnover, and his passer rating of 117.7 was a career high. He extended his streak of passes without an interception to 163.</p>
      <p>Brown finished with nine receptions for 137 yards, both season highs. The Bills netted a season-best 424 yards, and their point total was also a season high.</p>
      <p>The Bills scored on their first four possessions to take a 16-0 lead, and at that point they enjoyed a 211-24 advantage in total yards.</p>
      <p>Jakeem Grant scored for the Dolphins on a 101-yard kickoff return — his fourth career kick or punt return for a score. Grant also scored on a 7-yard run on a jet sweep.</p>
      <p>DeVante Parker set up Miami’s first touchdown by turning a short pass into a 50-yard gain.</p>
      <p>RISKY BUSINESS</p>
      <p>The gamble worked but didn’t pay off when Dolphins rookie coach Brian Flores tried an onside kick late in the second quarter after his team scored to trail 16-7.</p>
      <p>Kicker Jason Sanders recovered. But on the next play, receiver Allen Hurns lost a fumble at the Buffalo 25.</p>
      <p>INJURIES</p>
      <p>Dolphins: WR Gary Jennings (shoulder) missed the second half. … S Bobby McCain (shoulder) left the game in the third quarter. … T Julien Davenport (right knee) left in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Bills: T Ty Nsekhe (right ankle) was carted off the field in the third quarter. … S Siran Neal (concussion) sat out the second half.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>The Bills play host to the Broncos next Sunday. Denver hasn’t won in Buffalo since 2007.</p>
      <p>Next Sunday the Dolphins will play at Cleveland for the first time since 2013.</p>
