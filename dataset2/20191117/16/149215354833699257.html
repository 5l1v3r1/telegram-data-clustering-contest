      <p>Hopefully most of Sunday's NFL drama stems from tightly contested games, rather than any <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879043/myles-garrett-may-have-taken-old-coachs-advice-far">dangerous extracurricular activities</a> after the whistle. Here are four Week 11 games to watch.</p>
      <p><b>Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans, 1:00 p.m. E.T. on CBS — </b>This might be one of the best games of the season let alone this week. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has entered the MVP conversation, but Houston's signal caller DeShaun Watson has also emerged as one of the game's best players. On paper, this one projects to be a joy to watch as two of the game's brightest young stars go at it for the 7-2 Ravens and 6-3 Texans.</p>
      <p><b>Indianapolis Colts vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, 1:00 p.m. E.T. on CBS — </b>These two division rivals will face off with the playoffs on their minds and their quarterbacks returning to the field. Jacksonville will get prized free agent acquisition Nick Foles back after he suffered a broken collar bone in the first game of the season. Jacoby Brissett will slot back in under center for Indianapolis after missing last week's humbling loss to the Miami Dolphins. The 4-5 Jaguars and 5-4 Colts are two talented teams that have had up-and-down seasons so far, so this game could turn the tide for either.</p>
      <p><b>Philadelphia Eagles vs. New England Patriots, 4:25 p.m. E.T. on CBS — </b>The Patriots will look to avenge their first loss of the season against Baltimore two weeks ago while simultaneously paying the Eagles back for beating them in Super Bowl LII. The Eagles, meanwhile, are seeking their third straight win as they look to duplicate last year's late season surge.</p>
      <p><b>Los Angeles vs. Chicago Bears, 8:20 p.m. E.T. on NBC — </b>The primetime game features two teams suffering through disappointing seasons. But there's a ray of hope for each side, as they aim to repeat their playoff runs from last season. After four straight losses, the 4-5 Bears finally got a win against the Detroit Lions last week, while the 5-4 Rams are coming off a loss where they were stifled by the Pittsburgh Steelers defense.</p>
