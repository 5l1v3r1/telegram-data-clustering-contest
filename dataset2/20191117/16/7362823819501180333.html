      <p>“She has two small children at home that she has not been away from for this long,” the post said.</p>
      <p>The text to her mother said she was going to drive a friend to a Walmart, according to the post.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/22-year-old-mother-goes-missing-in-haralson-county">Fox 5 Atlanta</a> reported that Newsome sent the text after going to a doctor’s office for an appointment.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, in another Facebook post, the sheriff’s office said they had been in touch with the friend, Don Cox.</p>
      <p>“We have made contact with Mr. Cox, we are still investigating,” the post said.</p>
