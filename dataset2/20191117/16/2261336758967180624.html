      <p>Riding on a wave of confidence after UFC Sao Paulo, the 30-year-old UFC veteran now feels he deserves elite competition. During his Octagon interview with Michael Bisping, he named Conor McGregor and Paul Felder to be either one of his next opponents.</p>

      <p>During the post-fight presser, he explained the reason behind the callout.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s time for me to start talking more,” Oliveira told reporters. “Charles is the same guy. I come from the favelas, I’m grounded. But it’s time to dress a little better, talk a little more, and to say some names.</p>
      <p>“I said Conor McGregor’s name and Paul Felder’s name, who was the last guy to beat me,” he continued. “I want to get into that, fighting top-ten guys.”</p>

      <p>Oliveira also set his sights on current lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s talking about Khabib. I’m better than him standing up,” he said of the undefeated champion. “If it goes to the ground, I’m not gonna be afraid of him.”</p>
      <p>Oliveira currently holds a record of 28-8 (with 1 NC and 20 wins by stoppage).</p>
