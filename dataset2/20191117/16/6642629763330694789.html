      <p>An Indian Muslim group has said it will file a petition in the Supreme Court asking for a review of a ruling that awarded a disputed site in northern Uttar Pradesh state to Hindus, allowing them to build a temple there.</p>
      <p>The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, an umbrella body of intellectuals and organisations, said on Sunday it would seek a review of the judgement, which rejected Muslim claims over the land.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/babri-mosque-case-indian-top-court-disputed-site-hindus-191109052713446.html">landmark verdict</a> on November 9, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html">India</a>'s top court ruled that a 2.77 acre (1.1 hectare) plot of land in the town of Ayodhya should be awarded to Hindus, who believe it is the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu.</p>

      <p>The five-judge bench said Muslims will be given five acres of land at an alternative site in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>"There are apparent errors in the Supreme Court judgement, and we felt that it would be prudent to file a review petition," Syed Qasim Ilyas, a member of the group, told a press briefing.</p>
      <p>The main Muslim litigant in the case, the Sunni Waqf Board, has declined to file a review petition saying it respected the verdict.</p>
      <p>The site in Hindu-majority Ayodhya has been the centre of a bitter dispute between India's majority Hindus and Muslims, who make up about 14 percent of the population, since Indian independence.</p>
      <p>A 16th-century mosque, known as Babri Masjid, had been at the site until December 6, 1992, when it was destroyed by Hindu mobs.</p>
      <p>The country later witnessed some of the deadliest religious riots since independence, in which thousands of mostly Muslim Indians were killed.</p>
      <p>Hindus believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born at the site in Ayodhya and claim the first Mughal emperor Babur built the mosque on top of a temple there.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court verdict - announced amid heightened security across the country - was hailed by Hindus, but prompted a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/hindus-rejoice-muslim-reaction-mixed-ayodhya-verdict-191109131954176.html">mixed reaction</a> among the Muslim community in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>Some welcomed the decision, others rejected it, and there was a feeling of resignation - that Muslims had no choice but to accept the court's decision.</p>
