      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. – A Utah-based company issued a recall on its cat food sold nationwide over possible salmonella contamination, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration said.</p>
      <p>Go Raw, LLC is recalling its 2 lb. frozen bags of “Quest Beef Cat Food,” because it could be contaminated with salmonella and pose a risk to both pets and the humans handling the food.</p>
      <p>The recalled bags of food can be identified by UPC 6-91730-17101-8, Lot N128.</p>
      <p>“Pets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting,” the FDA said. “Some pets will have only decreased appetite, fever and abdominal pain.”</p>
      <p>Pets who are infected but appear otherwise healthy can be carriers, health officials say, and can infect other animals or humans.</p>
      <p>Humans can also be at risk if they handle the food without washing their hands afterward.</p>
      <p>The symptoms in people include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever.</p>
      <p>Those who have bought two-pound bags of Quest Beef Cat Food are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.</p>
