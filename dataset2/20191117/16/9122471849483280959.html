      <h1>Auburn Player Rips The Referees After Loss To Georgia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:21:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Auburn Tigers fell to 7-3 this week after losing 21-14 to SEC rival Georgia. But that loss wasn’t without a fair amount of controversial plays – several of which may have stymied a comeback attempt by the Tigers. And Auburn DE Marlon Davidson won’t let that go.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, Davidson called out the officiating. He asserted that it “felt like the referees were against” the Tigers and lamented essentially having to play against the Bulldogs and the officials.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.al.com/auburnfootball/2019/11/marlon-davidson-it-felt-like-auburn-had-to-beat-the-refs-and-georgia.html">AL.com</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“It felt like they were against us,” defensive end Marlon Davidson said. “I cannot lie about that. It hurts because I feel like some of the calls should’ve went the other way, for sure. They were getting more calls than we got, but (I) can’t speak on the refs; that’s their decision to make. But, you know, it just hurts when you see games being taken away by refs.<br/><br/>“You have to beat the refs and the team. That’s very hard to do, no matter what team you are.”</blockquote>
      <p>Among the plays that could have gone either way were an overturned onside kick recovery due to an illegal Auburn block, an overturned 17-yard reception by Seth Williams, and a missed facemask call on QB Bo Nix.</p>

      <p>With their third SEC loss of the season, the Tigers will now finish no better than third in the SEC West.</p>
      <p>Auburn will be hosting Samford of the FCS into Jordan-Hare next week before finishing the season against Alabama.</p>
      <p>As painful as the loss to Georgia may have felt, Davidson and the Tigers will feel a lot better if they can upset their arch-rivals on November 30.</p>
