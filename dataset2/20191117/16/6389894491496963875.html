      <h1>Ireland face familiar situation in crunch Euro 2020 qualifier with Denmark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:34:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Searles</a></address>
      <p>Heading into a play-off match to qualify for a major competition is a feeling that the Republic of Ireland are all too familiar with.</p>
      <p>The infamous Thierry Henry handball incident in 2009 saw them lose to France in extra-time and miss out on a place at the World Cup in South Africa the following summer.</p>
      <p>Then there were victories against Estonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to qualify for Euro 2012 and 2016 respectively.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to last year and Ireland were in another winner-takes-all affair as they endeavoured to reach the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p>
      <p>After holding Denmark to a 0-0 draw in Copenhagen, they would lose the second leg 5-1 in Dublin as Christian Eriksen netted a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow they face Denmark once again and, although it is technically a regular qualifier, it has in essence become another play-off for the Irish with a place at Euro 2020 on the line.</p>
      <h3>Familiar foes</h3>
      <p>This is the sixth time the two countries have met in 18 months, having also been in the same Nations League group last autumn.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side must beat the Danes in Dublin to join likely group winners Switzerland in next summer’s competition. Anything less and they will be doomed to another actual play-off.</p>
      <p>Coming into this weekend’s final round of qualifiers Ireland were top of Group D, having played a game more than rivals Denmark and Switzerland.</p>

      <p>But Denmark and Switzerland beat Gibraltar and Georgia respectively on Thursday to move above them into the two qualification spots.</p>
      <p>It has all but guaranteed the Swiss’s place at Euro 2020 as they prepare to take on Gibraltar tonight. For Ireland and Denmark, it is still all to play for.</p>
      <p>McCarthy has called the match a “cup final” and insisted that, as the group’s third seeds, the side find themselves in a great situation.</p>
      <p>“I’ve said at the very start, I would have taken this,” McCarthy said last month. “If you could have forgotten about all the other games and we’ll have a one-off game against Denmark, it would be brilliant.”</p>
      <h3>Onus on attack</h3>
      <p>At present, the Danes sit top of Group D with 15 points, three ahead of Ireland, but a win in Dublin would see the Irish move above them based on the countries’ head-to-head record.</p>
      <p>The pair drew the reverse fixture 1-1 and have in fact drawn their last three encounters, and four of the last five, with two 0-0 draws in the Nations League campaign too. The only defeat came in that World Cup play-off.</p>
      <p>However, this time Ireland will have to win to progress. Denmark, meanwhile, would only need another draw to qualify, putting the onus on their opponents to attack.</p>

      <p>McCarthy’s men have built their campaign on being tough to beat, conceding just four goals in seven games and keeping four clean sheets.</p>
      <p>Up front, they have been less intimidating scoring just six goals, while Denmark have scored 22.</p>
      <p>In fact, Ireland failed to score in their last two qualifiers against Switzerland and Georgia, and each of their six goals so far has come from a different player.</p>
      <p>Brighton forward Aaron Connolly, 19, had emerged as a possible late solution to their attacking woes, but has been ruled out with an untimely injury.</p>
      <p>There is welcome news, though, as Darren Randolph looks set to return from a four-week absence to start in goal.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper and his defence will be vital to Ireland’s efforts as history dictates that keeping Denmark at bay will be crucial.</p>
