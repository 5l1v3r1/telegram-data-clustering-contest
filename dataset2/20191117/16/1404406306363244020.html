      <p>Update 11/17/2019 4:00pm:</p>
      <p>Kodak Black’s lawyer recently took to Instagram to breakdown the new charges against the rapper, saying they aren’t new and were filed the day before he was arrested.</p>
      <p>The lawyer then said the State Attorney for Date is up for election this year, and this is the reason why they are gunning so hard for Kodak Black. He also noted that the State waited to file the charge to limit discovery. Stay tuned for more details in this situation and take a full look at his statement above. </p>

      <p>Kodak Black is reportedly facing a maximum prison sentence of 60 years after being charged with two new felony counts of firearm possession by a convicted felon. Miami-Dade DA's office issued the new charges, calling the rapper a "habitual offender." Both counts carry a maximum sentence of 30 years each but it has not been disclosed whether Kodak's potential sentencing would run concurrently or not. </p>
