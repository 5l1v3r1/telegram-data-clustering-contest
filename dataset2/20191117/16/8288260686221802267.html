      <h1>'Picking off form' - Aston Villa fans all have the same message for England boss Gareth Southgate</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest | Tyrone Mings was recalled to England's starting XI for Sunday's European Championship qualifying clash with Kosovo to earn his second Three Lions cap</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T16:09:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/elliott-jackson/, Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has delighted the Aston Villa faithful by recalling <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tyrone-mings">Tyrone Mings</a> to the England team to face Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions return to action for the final time in group A with qualification for next summer's European Championship finals already confirmed.</p>
      <p>England's 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday booked their place in the finals with a game to spare.</p>
      <p>Southgate opted to give John Stones the nod for that Wembley run out at the expense of Mings, in what was Stones' first appearance for England since the Nations League semi-finals in Portugal in June.</p>
      <p>Many, including former Arsenal defenders Lee Dixon and Ashley Cole, felt the decision was harsh on the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> defender, who acquitted himself well on his full debut against Bulgaria during the last international break.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, Mings has been given the chance to impress alongside Harry Maguire against Kosovo after getting back into the starting XI.</p>
      <p>He joins Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Chilwell, who both keep their places at full-back as part of Southgate's four-man backline.</p>
      <p>Nick Pope makes his full debut in goal, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain continues in midfield alongside Declan Rice and Harry Winks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling returns to the team after missing Thursday's match and lines up with captain Harry Kane and Callum Hudson-Odoi in attack.</p>
      <p>All the Villa focus is, of course, on Mings, with fans delighted to see him wearing the Three Lions shirt once again.</p>
      <p>Here's a full round-up of their reaction to the news.</p>
