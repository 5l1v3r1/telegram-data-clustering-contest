      <p>A Denver talk radio host was fired during his Saturday program after criticising President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Craig Silverman hosted “The Craig Silverman Show,” which aired Saturday mornings on 710 KNUS, a conservative radio station.<a href="https://kdvr.com/2019/11/16/denver-talk-radio-host-craig-silverman-fired-mid-show-after-criticizing-trump/">Denver’s Fox 31</a> reported that Silverman was fired after airing a segment about Roy Cohn, a ruthless attorney who had little to no regard to ethical guidelines in his work and represented the Trump family in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>The outlet also noted that Silverman’s program is no longer listed on the station’s <a href="https://710knus.com/programguidedaily?dayOfWeek=Saturday&amp;amp;timeFilter=0">website.</a></p>
      <p>In replying to a tweet of support, Silverman wrote online Saturday night that he rejects the “Trump party line.”</p>
      <p>“I cannot and will not toe strict Trump party line,” <a href="https://twitter.com/craigscolorado/status/1195783103643414528?s=20">Silverman wrote on Twitter</a>. “I call things as I see them. I see corruption and blatant dishonesty by President and his cronies. I also see bullying/smearing of American heroes w/courage to take oath and tell truth. Their bravery inspires me.”</p>
      <p>Joe Walsh, a longtime conservative figure and 2020 Republican presidential hopeful, wrote on Twitter that Silverman was “a great, honest voice on the radio” and his firing was “pathetic.”</p>

      <p>The incident came one day after Silverman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/craigalansilverman">posted a Facebook status</a> praising the US former envoy to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/trump-attacks-marie-yovanovitch-while-she-testifies-about-being-fired-2019-11">Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch</a> as “an American hero” for testifying in the impeachment hearings against Trump.</p>
      <p>Later in the post, he asks listeners to tune into his show for “independent analysis of the most important events of our time,” and that they “be prepared to be challenged.”</p>
      <p>Fox 31 reported that Silverman was slated to appear on CNN’s media-centric show “Reliable Sources” Sunday morning.</p>
