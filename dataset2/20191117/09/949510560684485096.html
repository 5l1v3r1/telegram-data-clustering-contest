      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — For all the talk about Ukraine in the House impeachment inquiry, Russia is just off-stage and playing a dominant role in this tale of international intrigue.</p>
      <p>As has so often been the case since President Donald Trump took office, Moscow provides the mood music for the unfolding political drama.</p>
      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Trump last week: “With you, Mr. President, all roads lead to Putin.” She was referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
      <p>In her testimony before the House impeachment panel last week, diplomat Marie Yovanovitch suggested that the president’s actions played into Putin’s hands.</p>
      <p>Rep. Devin Nunes of California is a key Trump ally on Capitol Hill. He has cast the impeachment inquiry as a continuation of the Democrats’ “spectacular implosion of their Russia hoax.”</p>
