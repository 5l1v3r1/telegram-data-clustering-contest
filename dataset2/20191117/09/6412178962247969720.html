        <b>Livingston are ready to sell Australian ace Lyndon Dykes in January with a host of English clubs making enquiries, TEAMtalk understands.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 6ft 2in forward, who can play anywhere across the front-line, was snapped up by Livi in January from Queen of the South, but he did not make his debut for the club until this season.</p>
      <p>Dykes has begun his career in Livingston in impressive style, however, netting five goals and assisting two others in 14 games, including three goals in eight outings in the Scottish Premiership.</p>
      <p>Such form has seen him attract interest from six Championship clubs, with Middlesbrough, Cardiff, Swansea, Bristol City, Blackburn and <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/derby-county"><b>Derby</b></a> all keen on making a move for the 24-year-old.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/middlesbrough"><b>Boro</b></a>, especially, are eyeing another forward to bolster their options up front while the other five clubs have also watched him in action in recent weeks and the player could be set for a move south of the border in January.</p>
      <p>Dykes is yet to make his debut on the international stage but is eligible to play for both Australia – his country of birth – and Scotland, where his parents are from.</p>
