      <h1>Everton fan favourite Lucas Digne explains how he had to adapt to English football</h1>
      <h2>Lucas Digne has become a key player for Everton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:15:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Lucas Digne has been discussing his life at Everton whilst away on international duty with the French national team. </p>
      <p>Everton snapped up the Frenchman from Barcelona last summer in a deal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/01/everton-lucas-digne-barcelona-signing">reported by The Guardian</a> to be worth around £18 million.</p>
      <p>He has quickly become a fan favourite at Goodison Park and his performances have certainly warranted the affection of the Everton faithful. </p>

      <p>He has even recently captained Marco Silva’s side, wearing the armband against West Ham, Brighton and Spurs in the Premier League. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/albanie-france-je-suis-tres-fier-de-ma-carriere-confie-lucas-digne-16-11-2019-8194776.php">Speaking to Le Parisien,</a> the 26-year-old spoke of how he had to adapt to English football and how he felt having the opportunity to captain the Toffees. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I had to adapt quickly to the intensity, the physical impacts, playing fast forward and repeating the high-intensity efforts. I crossed a plateau. I am asked to be very offensive. But this involves defensively many duels in one against one because the matches are very open. This is the championship that suits me best.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“There was a list of four captains. I was the fourth so I knew it could happen even if the probability was low. It is a pride to wear this armband. It’s only been a season and a half I’m at the club, so it’s a great sign of confidence.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Frenchman has certainly improved since he initially arrived at Everton. Whilst the offensive side of his game was never in any doubt he often left the team exposed defensively as a consequence during his early days at the club. </p>
      <p>However, that is no longer a regular problem for the Everton star, who has certainly improved the defensive aspect of his game. </p>
      <p>As for the captaincy, there is no reason why Digne cannot be a candidate for the role long-term with Seamus Coleman recently finding himself out of the team due to a poor run of form.</p>
