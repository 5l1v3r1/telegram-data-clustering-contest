      <h1>SAA Workers Vow To Continue Strike Until Demands Met</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:36:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>South African Airways (SAA) workers have vowed to continue their strike until the company meets their demands.</p>
      <p>Numsa members embarked on a strike on Friday following failed wage talks. They are demanding an 8% salary hike while SAA is offering 5,9% a pay rise. The industrial action has forced the airline to cancel some international and local flights.</p>
      <p>Striking workers were protesting outside the SAA head offices on Saturday, demanding better wages. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said workers should fight for their rights.</p>
      <p>The parties were locked in a meeting in an attempt to resolve the dispute. SAA said it was losing more than 50 million per day as a result of the strike.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a group of SAA employees once again gathered on the outskirts of Cape Town International Airport.</p>
      <p>South African Cabin Crew Association shop steward Sonja Eidz said they gathered on a field in the cargo operations area.</p>
      <p>“In Cape Town and Johannesburg, we have many members. We are not backing down on our demands. This went from a strike for increases to a strike for job protection.”</p>
      <p>SAA announced that it planned to retrench more than 900 workers.</p>
