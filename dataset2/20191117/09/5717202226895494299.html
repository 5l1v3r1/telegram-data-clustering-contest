        <b>Everton are battling Southampton and Crystal Palace for Nottingham Forest midfielder Matty Cash ahead of the January transfer window, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">according to a report from The Sun</a>.</b>

      <p>The 22-year-old has been outstanding for Sabri Lamouchi’s men so far this season. He has scored two goals and provided two assists in 14 Championship games.</p>

      <p>The Sun reports that Forest, unsurprisingly, want to keep the academy graduate. However, the report notes that Cash wants to play in the Premier League. And with his contract expiring in 2021, Forest may not be in a strong position if he decides that he would like to leave the City Ground.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">The Sun suggests</a> that Toffees have sent scouts to watch the youngster, and Marco Silva’s men are now weighing up making a £12 million bid in January.</p>

      <p>Everton may not have a clear run to his signature however, with The Sun adding that the Saints and Eagles are also admirers of Cash.</p>
      <h3>TBR View</h3>
      <p>It is little surprise that the Premier League trio are tracking Cash. Not only has he been excellent for Forest this term, but he also offers plenty of versatility.</p>
      <p>Before this season, he had predominantly played further up the right flank. But he also has experience of playing in the middle or even slightly further forward in attacking midfield.</p>
      <p>He has provided 10 goals and 10 assists in 101 Championship games. And given that he should only get better in the coming years, it is not difficult to see why Everton are reportedly keen.</p>
