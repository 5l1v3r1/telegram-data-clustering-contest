      <h1>NFL Week 11: Lamar Jackson meets Deshaun Watson in unmissable battle of MVP candidates</h1>
      <h2>Mirror NFL columnist JASON BELL gives his take on the Myles Garrett ban and unmissable match-up between Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:21:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/, Jason Bell</a></address>
      <p>The person everyone is talking about right now is Myles Garrett, and what happened on Thursday Night Football was shocking.</p>
      <p>Everybody agrees. It was terrible, and the indefinite suspension he’s been given until at least the end of the season is exactly what should have happened as a precedent needed to be set.</p>
      <p>As a player, I feel so let down because in the NFL, we’re in a position where everyone is looking at us as role models. You have kids watching who see everything we do on that field, so to do something like Myles Garrett did, hitting another player with their helmet, is unacceptable. </p>
      <p>I definitely understand emotions run high in the game, but as a player there’s a thing we always do in terms of looking out for each other. NFL players are your brothers and sisters.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>When a helmet comes off, that’s usually when everyone slows down as they know the person is not protected.</p>
      <p>We’re trying to look out for each other, make sure we’re all safe and can all go home safe. It’s a sad situation and a case of player not looking out for his fellow professionals.</p>
      <h3>MVP contenders face off</h3>
      <p>The Myles Garrett incident was a bad moment for the NFL, but the league is lucky that on Sunday we get a great game between two MVP candidates - Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson. </p>
      <p>The Baltimore Ravens heading to the Houston Texans is a great match-up because the other sides of the ball match up well. </p>
      <p>The third-ranked Texans run defence is going to look to stop Lamar Jackson and Mark Ingram. Baltimore’s strong secondary and pass defence has to go up against Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It’s a game that’s a case of strength on strength, and I’m excited to see if Lamar can pull off another big win. </p>
      <p>He's been outstanding so far, and he's a special player with movement that means he can do things other players just can't do.</p>
      <p>This season, we've seen him in an offense tailored for him. Last year, he was coming in to Joe Flacco's offense, but this year he's there guy.</p>
      <p>Running a system designed for him, with a whole off-season to prepare, we've seen him take a massive jump and become so exciting to watch.</p>
      <p>It's going to be huge for him if he can come out of this game with a win as well, but the Texans and Deshaun Watson can't be taken lightly.</p>
      <h3>Super Bowl LII rematch - but narrative moved on</h3>
      <p>We've got a repeat of what was the Super Bowl a couple of years ago as the Philadelphia Eagles take on the New England Patriots.</p>
      <p>It's a big one for both sides, but these are two different teams and things have moved on since they met in Super Bowl LII.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The Patriots have to bounce back in their first game since struggling against the Ravens, and it will be interesting to see how they respond to that first loss.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are in the fight for the NFC East and need to keep up with Dallas, so this is huge for them as well.</p>
      <h3>Player to Watch - Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens) </h3>
      <p>A game-changer in the truest sense of the word. His unique skillset is something you just can’t account for and can’t coach. Nobody else can do the things he does. </p>
