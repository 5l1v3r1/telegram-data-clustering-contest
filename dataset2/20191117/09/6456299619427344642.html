      <p>"On the 2-year anniversary of DC and Warner Bros.' <i>Justice League</i>, Wonder Woman and Batman themselves have joined fans' calls for the release of director Zack Snyder's cut of the much-maligned 2017 film," reports <i>Entertainment Weekly:</i> <i>Both Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot tweeted "#ReleaseTheSnyderCut" on Sunday, with Gadot also posting a photo of her character, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman... Affleck and Gadot joined other DC actors, like Ray Fisher (Cyborg) and Christina Wren (Major Carrie Farris), who posted on social media for the anniversary to <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/17/gal-gadot-ben-affleck-release-zack-snyder-cut-justice-league/">demand the release of Snyder's original vision for <i>Justice League</i></a>...<br/><br/>Jason Momoa and director Kevin Smith added fuel to the fire this summer after they said they've either seen the Snyder cut or heard about it from reliable sources. In August, Momoa posted an Instagram video with Snyder, saying the director had shown him the cut and that it was "ssssiiicccckkkkkk." Smith was less complimentary, saying the cut was "not a finished movie by any stretch of the imagination."<br/><br/>Still, it is a big deal that Justice League's own stars are calling for a redo of sorts. </i><br/>Momoa, who plays Aquaman, said in early November "<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/why-justice-leagues-gal-gadot-and-ben-affleck-are-tweeting-release-the-snyder-cut/">I think the public needs to see it</a>," according to CNET. But <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> isn't convinced that will happen. <br/><br/>"Despite the groundswell, and speculation that a Snyder Cut could go to Warner Bros.' upcoming streaming service HBO Max, insiders tell <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/snyder-cut-ben-affleck-gal-gadot-call-new-justice-league-release-1255582">no announcement of a release of a Snyder Cut is imminent</a>.</p>
