      <p>Zakaria has been outstanding for the surprise Bundesliga leaders. The Daily Mirror reports that several top clubs across Europe want the 22-year-old.</p>

      <p>But it appears that Arsenal have an ace up their sleeve as they look to land the midfielder. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-offer-granit-xhaka-borussia-20896461">The Daily Mirror reports</a> that the Gunners could allow Xhaka to return to Monchengladbach during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The Mirror suggests that Newcastle United also want Xhaka. However, the Swiss would reportedly favour a move back to his former club.</p>

      <p>The report notes that Arsenal, in return for Xhaka, would want first refusal on Zakaria next summer.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Could Xhaka soon secure the popularity he craves at Arsenal?</h3>
      <p>From the outside, it does appear that there is no way back for Xhaka at the Emirates. And perhaps his exit may make him more popular than he has been for the large majority of his Arsenal spell.</p>
      <p>Gunners fans are probably ready for the 27-year-old to leave anyway. So it would be perhaps be best for all parties if Xhaka returns to Germany, particularly if it boosts the chances of Zakaria moving in the opposite direction at the end of the season.</p>
