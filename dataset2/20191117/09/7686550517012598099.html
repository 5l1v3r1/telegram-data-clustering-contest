      <h1>The strain on the train that drives us all insane | Carolyn Hitt</h1>
      <h2>Our columnist lets off some steam about the worst kinds of people you find yourself sat next to on the train</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:51:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:51</time> by <a rel="author">Carolyn Hitt</a></address>
      <p>There was a time when rail companies promoted a train journey as a positively zen-like experience.</p>
      <p>Remember that advert for letting “the train take the strain”? The one where the ambience was so serene that even the Penguin logo on the passenger’s novel slumped happily into the snooze position while a smiling woman gazed in reverie at the beautiful landscape flashing by.</p>
      <p>But now trains can be the frontline of divided Britain as all manner of polarisations may play out in carriage D with concepts of acceptable behaviour going off the rails.</p>
      <p>Take the case that has given kicking up a stink a whole new meaning. A 50-year-old woman was fined £1500 this week after she yelled at a fellow commuter for eating boiled eggs on a rush-hour train.</p>
      <p>Samantha Mead was accused of putting on a “bad face” when Erika Stoter prised open the lid of her Tupperware box of less than fragrant eggs during a 6.00am journey from Chelmsford, Essex to London. Mead then leaned into the snacking passenger’s face “quickly and aggressively”.</p>
      <p>Ms Stoter admitted the eggs were emitting a “bad odour”. Mead confronted the younger woman, calling the smell “disgusting” and also threatened her, the jury was told. Mead was found guilty of a charge of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress and ordered to pay a £750 fine and £750 in compensation.</p>
      <p>For an altercation over smelly eggs to end up in court shows how strongly folk can feel about consuming on the commute. England’s outgoing Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies caused a furore over the border recently when she proposed a ban on eating on public transport.</p>
      <p>She wanted to stamp out munching on the move to tackle the junk food addiction fuelling the obesity crisis. Yet social media timelines seethed with outrage as commuters contemplated the horror of being separated from a Greggs sausage and bean melt on their way to work.</p>
      <p>But for every passenger fighting for their right to chomp in transit there are those who find it a devastating assault on their senses. The cacophony of crisp or carrot crunching. The sickly savoury whiff of a Burger King bag. The inevitable slurp-yelp that comes when a scalding buffet-carriage coffee is negotiated too soon.</p>
      <p>The scary expression on the bloke downing his third can of Special Brew before 10.00am.</p>
      <p>The apple cores wedged down the side of the seats. The detritus of crumbs on tables and slivers of chocolate melting into unsuspecting backsides. The noise, the smells, the sights, the stains...it can all add up to making the journey more Midnight Express than Orient Express.</p>
      <p>And yet there are worse things people can do on trains. Eating is, after all, a necessary human function and long treks by track inevitably coincide with meal-times. Anyone who has travelled from Cardiff to Holyhead by rail will know that the approach of the trolley on that endless odyssey can feel like a beautiful mirage in the desert.</p>
      <p>Babies need to be fed, blood-sugar needs to be regulated, and frankly if I’m on a girls’ trip somewhere vaguely exciting a range of snacks, a packet of Percy Pigs and a mini-Prosecco from the station M&amp;S is essential.</p>
      <p>Plus anyone whose cheapskate boss insists on them travelling home from London on the rammed 7.15pm super off-peak Great Western for economic reasons deserves a cheeky G&amp;T and tub of Pringles as a reward.</p>
      <p>So as long as you’re not inflicting too much olfactory offence on your fellow carriage dwellers, then munching on the move is fine. There are more heinous commuter crimes. Give me a gently nibbling passenger over these irritating travellers any time:</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Space Hoggers</b>
      </p>
      <p>These are the types who arrange their belongings across two seats, man-spread, then feign deep sleep as you prod them to budge up. The really rude ones do all of this in a seat you have actually reserved.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Corporate Callers</b>
      </p>
      <p>The men in suits who simply want to inform other men in suits that they are "on the train". Sometimes they might want to up the corporate conversational ante by telling the contact on the other end of the line that they "just want to touch base". Yet however banal the exchange it will always end in exactly the same way: you’re breaking up and "we’re going into A tunnel".</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Hoodies in Headphones</b>
      </p>
      <p>Save us from the teenagers nodding like the Churchill Insurance dog as the tinny tyranny of their death metal playlist leaks out of their ear buds on to traumatised Radio 2 listeners.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Gadget Geeks</b>
      </p>
      <p>These are the people who can’t survive a journey without being hooked up to some form of digital equipment. And they all come with sound effects. There are the lap-top tappers who approach their keyboards with the fervour of the percussion section of the Royal Philharmonic. There are the kids with bleeping Nintendos. And there are the texters who are too stupid to find the setting that knocks off the irritating clicky sound their phones make when they type.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Too Much Information Brigade</b>
      </p>
      <p>Seemingly oblivious to the toe-curling discomfort of their fellow passengers, these are the people who broadcast horrendously intimate details as they bleat into their smartphones. I once – this is no word of a lie – sat behind a woman who had phone sex all the way from Swindon to Cardiff Central. Celia Johnson would have had a coronary. The amount of men who watch porn on public transport is also deeply disturbing.</p>
      <p>As Sartre said, “hell is other people”. Nowhere can that feel more obvious than in the confinements of carriage D somewhere approaching Didcot Parkway. But if you don’t want to feel the strain of the train, stay clear of smartphones, headphones…and boiled eggs.</p>
