      <h1>Strike: South African Airways hold talks with unions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:33:19+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>South African Airways on Saturday held a first round of mediated talks with unions, one day after its workers launched an open-ended strike that forced the embattled airline to ground hundreds of flights.</p>
      <p>More than 3,000 workers — including cabin crew, technical and ground staff — started striking on Friday to demand higher pay and to protest against restructuring plans involving heavy job losses.</p>
      <p>The walkout forced South Africa’s cash-strapped flag carrier to cancel more than 300 domestic and regional flights between Friday and Monday.</p>
      <p>South African Airways said unions had agreed to start talks on Saturday mediated by an independent labour dispute resolution body.</p>
      <p>“No agreement at this stage,” SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali told <i>AFP</i> at the end of the day, adding that a new date would be set “to continue with negotiations”.</p>
      <p>Unions first threatened to strike after SAA announced this week that almost 1,000 employees could lose their jobs as part of a restructuring process.</p>
      <p>Talks with management deadlocked after they failed to agree on wage hikes, prompting unions to press on with their threats.</p>
      <p>SAA is offering a 5.9 per cent pay rise, while unions are demanding an eight percent across-the-board hike and a three-year guarantee of job security.</p>
      <p>“Our efforts are focused on finding solutions that accommodate the employee demands, safeguard the business and return operations to normal,” said Kemp.</p>
      <p>“We are exploring all possible avenues.”</p>
      <p>He added that it was a “critical time” for the company.</p>
      <p>SAA is one of the biggest airlines in Africa. It employs more than 5,000 workers, with a fleet of more than 50 aircrafts providing dozens of domestic, regional and international flights each day.</p>
      <p>But the carrier is deep in debt, despite several government bailouts, and has not posted a profit since 2011.</p>
      <p>Tlali told <i>AFP</i> the airline was losing 52 million rand ($3.5 million) per day due to flight cancellations.</p>
      <p>International flights are scheduled to resume on Sunday, said the airline, while regional and domestic flights remain cancelled until Monday.</p>
