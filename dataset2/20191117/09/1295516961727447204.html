      <h1>Suicide Squad Star Margot Robbie Says You'll Be 'Laughing a Lot'</h1>

      <p>Margot Robbie won't say much about the upcoming <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/suicide-squad-2/">Suicide Squad</a> reboot, except that it's very funny.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/margot-robbie-bombshell-suicide-squad-2-bird-of-prey-1203404002/">Variety</a> sat down with Robbie to discuss her upcoming film <i>Bombshell</i>, which details the women who spoke out about Roger Ailes and his rampant sexual harassment. But the interview also touched on Robbie's two upcoming reprisals of her character Harley Quinn. For <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which will act as a soft relaunch of the franchise following the mixed reception to 2016's film, Robbie remained tight-lipped, except to tease the comedy of the film. "You’re going to be laughing a lot," said Robbie. "It’s going to be good is all I can say for now. It’s going to be very, very good."</p>

      <p>Though David Ayer's <i>Suicide Squad</i> did well at the box office, it split fans and was not viewed kindly by critics. And while talk about sequels and spinoffs circulated for a time, DC ultimately decided to attempt a reboot of the series, one that will focus on even more characters—though they won't be long for the DCEU, given the premise of Task Force X. The film will also see James Gunn take over, bringing <a href="https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-unites-suicide-squad-guardians-stars-pumpkin-carving/">the Squad and the Guardians of the Galaxy</a> even closer together.</p>
      <p>Robbie also discussed Birds of Prey, revealing it will be everything from heartbreaking to bonkers to violent. All told, Harley Quinn fans are about to have a good couple of years.</p>
      <p>Written and directed by James Gunn, The Suicide Squad is set to hit theaters Aug. 6, 2021. Several cast members from 2016's Suicide Squad will reprise their roles, including Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg and Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang. Also joining the cast are David Dastmalchian, John Cena, Joaquin Cosio, Nathan Fillion, Mayling Ng, Flula Borg, Sean Gunn, Juan Diego Botto, Storm Reid, Pete Davidson, Taika Waititi, Alice Braga, Steve Agee, Tinashe Kajese, Daniela Melchior, Peter Capaldi, Julio Ruiz, Jennifer Holland, Idris Elba and Michael Rooker.</p>
