        <b>Leaving the England camp will allow Joe Gomez to “clear his head” following a challenging few days, Gareth Southgate said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate believes Raheem Sterling’s public message of support for Joe Gomez has drawn a line under a tumultuous week.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez became embroiled in a media storm following a bust-up at the beginning of the international break.</p>
      <p>Southgate dropped Manchester City star Sterling for Friday’s Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Montenegro, a match partially overshadowed by the boos that greeted Liverpool defender Gomez upon his second-half introduction at Wembley.</p>
      <p>The “upsetting experience” for Gomez, as Southgate termed it, prompted Sterling to issue a social media statement accepting “full responsibility” for the spat and defending his team-mate.</p>
      <p>An eventful few days took another unexpected turn on Saturday when Gomez pulled out of the squad due to a minor knee problem, but the Three Lions boss now hopes to move forward without further scrutiny of squad harmony.</p>
      <p>“You couldn’t make it up, really, if you tried,” Southgate said of Gomez’s injury, which rules him out of Sunday’s game against Kosovo.</p>
      <p>“He’s absolutely fine. He took a clash of knees [on Friday]. We scanned it just to be certain and I think he’ll be fine in a couple of days, but he wasn’t able to train.”</p>

      <p>Southgate continued: “We actually ended up having a chuckle this morning at the ridiculousness of him having to go home in the way he did.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a difficult week for him but one that will make him stronger and one that he’s dealt with really well.</p>
      <p>“I think now is a good moment for him just to go home for a couple of days, clear his head. The pleasing thing for me is that we’ve got him back on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I think the fact that Raheem put out the tweet that he did the other night was real closure on that whole incident.</p>
      <p>“We get Raheem back on the pitch [against Kosovo]. We won the match on Thursday and we can now just look forward.”</p>
      <p>England have already sealed Euro 2020 qualification leading into Sunday’s final Group A fixture in Pristina.</p>
      <p>Southgate will reportedly hand goalkeeper Nick Pope his first international start, while Callum Hudson-Odoi could replace Jadon Sancho in attack.</p>
