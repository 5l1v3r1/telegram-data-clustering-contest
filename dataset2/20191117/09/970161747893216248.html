      <h1>Boris Johnson surges ahead in election polls as Tories take 15% lead</h1>

      <p>The latest polls have given <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> a major pre-election boost, with forecasters suggesting the Conservatives boast a 15-point lead over Labour, despite a stuttering start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Less than a month before the General Election on December 12, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7693553/Boris-Johnson-surges-ahead-Jeremy-Corbyn-polls.html">a Deltapoll for The Mail on Sunday</a> puts the Prime Minister’s party on 45%, ahead of Labour on 30%.</p>
      <p>The four point rise for the Tories – and one point rise for Labour, comes at the expenses of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>However, polling industry has been widely slated for its forecasts of the 2017 election – and this year’s vote is seen as particularly difficult to predict, with the Lib Dems and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party expected to take votes from the main parties in varying numbers in different seats. They sit third and fourth in the poll, on 11% and 6%.</p>

      <p>There are also a number of pacts in place in seats locally – many allied across ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ lines, making the outcome even harder to call.</p>

      <p>And north of the border, the Scottish National Party are again expected to outperform the two main parties.</p>
      <p>A usually more reliable ‘poll of polls’ puts the Conservatives on 39%, Labour on 29%, the Lib Dems on 16% and the Brexit Party on 6%, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">according to Politico</a>.</p>
      <p>Yet that poll was only up to date on Thursday, compared to today’s forecast by Deltapoll.</p>
      <p>And yesterday, a YouGov poll made similarly bleak reading for Jeremy Corbyn’s party – with the Tories up three points to 45% and Labour sitting an eye-watering 17 points behind, on 28%.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn is hoping that Tuesday’s live television debate can boost his chances, as he looks to repeat the 2017 campaign when his party surged in the polls in the week’s leading up to the vote, defying gloomy predictions.</p>
      <p>In that election, both the Tories and Labour won more than 40% of the national vote, but neither managed to convert it into a majority in Parliament.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson, meanwhile, will be hoping to retain his lead and convert the vote share into a majority in Parliament.</p>
      <p>Polling expert Joe Twyman told the Mail on Sunday: ‘There is still nearly a month to go and things could change dramatically. Plus, it is how all the parties perform in each of the 650 individual constituencies that really matters.’</p>
      <p>The Deltapoll co-founder and director continued: ‘Polls inevitably move up and down during a campaign and the long-term trends could still move back in their favour. The story of the 2019 General Election is not yet written.’</p>
