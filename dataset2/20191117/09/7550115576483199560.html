      <p>Gomez was forced to pull out of the England squad after taking a knock to his knee in a challenge with Kieran Trippier in training, ending a strange week for the 22-year-old.</p>
      <p>In the fallout from the 3-1 victory over <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a>, an irate Raheem Sterling attacked the Reds’ No. 12 in the Three Lions camp and, after an apology from the winger, Gomez was booed in the 7-0 win over Montenegro.</p>
      <p>There were calls for Southgate to start both Gomez and Sterling against Kosovo on Sunday evening as a show of solidarity, but that is no longer possible.</p>
      <p>“You couldn’t make it up really if you tried,” the England manager said of the situation.</p>
      <p>“I think now is a good moment for him just to go home for a couple of days, clear his head.</p>
      <p>“He’s absolutely fine. He took a clash of knees yesterday. We scanned it just to be certain and I think he’ll be fine in a couple of days, but he wasn’t able to train today.</p>
      <p>“He was in a much better place very quickly. We actually ended up having a chuckle this morning at the ridiculousness of him having to go home in the way he has.</p>
      <p>“So, I think for him it’s been a difficult week, as you say, but one that will make him stronger and one that he’s dealt with really well.”</p>

      <p>Gomez has not been a regular starter for Liverpool so far this season, and was unlikely to be part of the lineup at Selhurst Park, with the expected return of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joel-matip/">Joel Matip</a> increasing competition.</p>
      <p>But his improving fitness will boost <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s options at centre-back and right-back, at a time where there are question marks over a host of other players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> both pulled out of international duty due to injury and will be considered doubts, while <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jordan-henderson/">Jordan Henderson</a> also left the England squad due to illness.</p>
      <p>Klopp should have the majority of his key players back midway through next week, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a> among those to play their final games on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gomez will still have another scan on his return to Melwood, as Liverpool seek their own opinion.</p>
