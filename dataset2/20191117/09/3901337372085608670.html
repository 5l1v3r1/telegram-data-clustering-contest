      <p>Maritzburg United know they’ll have to be wary of Kaizer Chiefs’ in-form attackers, but the Team of Choice aren’t in a mood to be fearful of the Glamour Boys right now…</p>

      <p>Chiefs may be top of the Absa Premiership table at present, seven places above Maritzburg in eighth, but Eric Tinkler’s side find themselves on a good run of form in all competitions and will be pleased with the way they’ve progressed since last year’s relegation battle.</p>
      <p>The two sides will lock horns on November 24 at Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit as each team seeks a spot in the 2019 Telkom Knockout final, and Rushine De Reuck is likely to play a big role if his side are going to get the job done against the likes of Khama Billiat, Leonardo Casto and Co.</p>
      <p>De Reuck is set to shoulder a lot of responsibility in the tie following the suspension of Kwanda Mngonyama and injury to Siyanda Xulu, and he’ll have to be in top form if he’s to keep quiet the joint-top-scoring team in the Absa Premiership in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>Speaking to his club’s official website ahead of the tie later this month, the defender said, “Not only the back four or five will have to defend, but everyone… We’re all defending and attacking together so credit must go to the whole team the way the coach has set us up.</p>
      <p>"This is going to be very important to apply it to our match against Chiefs because they are very good… They have Billiat and Castro but with the quality we have, I believe that we will do well.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is expected to start at the heart of Maritzburg’s defence in Mpumalanga, and will be hoping they can use the international break to make sure they’re properly prepared.</p>
