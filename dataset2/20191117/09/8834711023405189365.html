      <h1>SAA Workers Urged To Continue Fight For A Living Wage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:30:21+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/sporteditor/" target="_blank">SW Editor</a></address>
      <p>Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim has called on striking South African Airways (SAA) employees to continue fighting for living wages.</p>
      <p>Jim was addressing workers outside the SAA head office in Kempton Park. Workers went on strike on Friday following failed wage talks.</p>
      <p>Employees are demanding an 8% wage hike while the employer is offering a 5.9% pay rise.</p>
      <p>The strike has seen international and local flights being cancelled.</p>
      <p>But Jim has encouraged workers to not give up.</p>
      <p>“We want them to come to the table and offer wages for workers. They must increase wages for workers. This is what we’re saying.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali told AFP the airline was losing R52 million per day due to flight cancellations.</p>
