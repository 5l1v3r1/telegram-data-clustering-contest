      <p>Srinagar: Rail services in the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kashmir">Kashmir</a> Valley resumed fully on Sunday - over three months after being suspended due to security reasons- as the train chugged from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Srinagar">Srinagar</a> to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Banihal">Banihal</a> through the restive south Kashmir, officials said.</p>
      <p>The train passes through Srinagar station and the stations in south Kashmir before reaching Banihal.</p>
      <p>A railway official told PTI that "rail service in the valley fully resumed this morning as the train chugged from Baramulla towards Banihal".</p>
      <p>The official said there was only one run scheduled for Sunday, while the train would make two runs on daily basis from Monday.</p>
      <p>The Railways conducted two trial runs of the service on the Srinagar-Banihal stretch on Saturday and then another trial run on Sunday morning before the actual service started, he added.</p>
      <p>Rail service in the valley had partially resumed on Tuesday as the train chugged between Baramulla and Srinagar stretch of the railway line.</p>
      <p>The authorities have directed the Railways to ply the trains between 10 am and 3 pm only due to security reasons, the official said.</p>
      <p>The train service in the Kashmir valley was suspended due to security reasons on August 3 ahead of the Centre's announcement of abrogation of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Article-370">Article 370</a> and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union territories.</p>
      <p>The weekly flea market here, meanwhile, witnessed a huge rush of customers, official said. <br/>They said markets remained open around noon, after which shopkeepers downed their shutters to join the protest against abrogation of the special status of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Jammu-and-Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>.</p>
      <p>Few mini-buses have started plying on some routes in the city and elsewhere in the valley, the officials said, adding, cabs and auto-rickshaws were also plying. They said private transport was plying unhindered in the city here and elsewhere in the valley.</p>
      <p>Pre-paid mobile phones and all Internet services continued to remain suspended since 5 August.</p>
      <p>Most of the top level and second rung separatist politicians have been taken into preventive custody while mainstream leaders including two former chief ministers -- Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- have been either detained or placed under house arrest.</p>
      <p>The government has detained former chief minister and sitting Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar Farooq Abdullah under the controversial Public Safety act.</p>
