      <p>The recent letter to the editor, ” Clean air causing global warming,” was very interesting, although I wonder where the writer gets his facts. I must admit that I have to question everything that I believe about this subject. After all, most of us hear or read things from other people and use these “facts” to form our own opinions.</p>
      <p>I have myself heard a lot of different statements about climate change; some say it is not caused by human activity, some say it is a man made problem but we can deal with it, so don’t worry. Some even say that it is a good thing, such as the writer’s statement that someday we may be able to grow avocados and oranges in Washington. I am not looking forward to California climate and the problems associated with it. But maybe they are ready for some of our weather down there.</p>
      <p>Of course there are also some who deny all science regarding the subject, saying it is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I’m not sure why China would do that since they have much more to lose than most, having a large amount of coal-fired power plants that will have to be shut down.</p>
      <p>I think that regardless of what any one person or group of people believe, there is one thing that common sense tells us and it is this: Pollution of our atmosphere is harmful to us all and needs to stop.</p>
