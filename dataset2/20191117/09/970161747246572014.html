      <p>Danny Dyer’s game show The Wall has been given a second series after a successful first run on Saturday nights.</p>
      <p>The EastEnders regular fronted the new series, in which balls were dropped down a giant wall to earn or lost contestants money in a prize pot.</p>
      <p>Airing after Strictly each week, The Wall earned an impressive 4.1million a week despite being against ITV rival, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the new series, Danny said: ‘I can’t believe we’re doing another series of The Wall.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t wait to get stuck back in and meet these new contestants and hopefully make them very rich.’</p>
      <p>Kate Phillips, Controller of Entertainment Commissioning at BBC added: ‘I know Danny and Angela had an absolute ball making series one of The Wall and it’s great to see how much BBC One viewers have enjoyed the ride.</p>

      <p>‘This wildly unpredictable format, or nutty old show as Danny would say, has quickly become a Saturday night favourite for all ages, and I’m looking forward to more big drops, big shocks and big decisions in series two.’</p>
