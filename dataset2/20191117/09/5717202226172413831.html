        <b><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/">According to a report from The Sun on Sunday (17/11; page 67)</a>, Bournemouth are bracing themselves for a massive bid for Nathan Ake with Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur set to target a new defender in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ake has been a revelation for the Cherries. The 24-year-old has started all 12 league games for Eddie Howe’s men this season, and it appears that he has plenty of admirers.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/">The Sun on Sunday (17/11; page 67) reports</a> that Bournemouth are planning a move for Preston North End defender Ben Davies, with Ake’s future leaving them with cause for concern.</p>
      <p>The report notes that Spurs and Pep Guardiola’s men are looking for a new centre-back in January. And it appears that the £40 million-rated Dutchman could prove to be a potential target.</p>

      <h3>TBR View – Tottenham should prioritise Ake move</h3>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino certainly needs to use January to give everyone at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium a boost. They sit 14th in the table, and are significantly closer to the bottom three than top four.</p>
      <p>With uncertainty surrounding Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, Ake would arguably be a smart signing. Not only can the former Chelsea man help address their defensive problems, but he can also push slightly further forward into midfield if required.</p>
      <p>He also has experience of working in a back three or four. So Pochettino should arguably jump at the chance to add him to his ranks when January arrives.</p>
      <p>And with Bournemouth reportedly eyeing up a replacement, Spurs may perhaps find that their divisional rivals are more open to accepting a significant offer.</p>
