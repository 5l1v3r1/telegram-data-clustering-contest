        <b>Emmerdale is lining up a new romance for Tracy Shankley (Amy Walsh) and Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan) towards the end of this year – but fans are already preparing themselves for disaster as Pete is due to exit the show before long.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was recently reported that Anthony would soon finish filming with the show, meaning that any hope of a long term future for him and Tracy seems to have been dashed. Both characters are pretty unlucky in love after the breakdown of relationships with David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) and Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) – and that doesn’t seem set to change.</p>
      <p>However, quite how far the romance goes – and how it will conclude – remains to be seen as details of Pete’s exit story remains under wraps.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Inside Soap Yearbook 2020, Amy teased: ‘There’s a flirtation going on between Tracy and Pete at the moment, so I’m hoping she’ll get some kind of happiness there. I want her to find love, even if it’s not with Pete.</p>

      <p>‘I’d love to work with Matthew again, but getting back with David isn’t the right thing for Tracy. She’s too good for him!’</p>

      <p>The other relationship in Tracy’s life has been that with her sister Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick) as both women have dealt with the fallout of Frank’s death differently.</p>
      <p>Amy explained: ‘I think it’s really nice to see the sisters’ relationship and how they deal with their grief very differently. It’s an extremely important message to tell, because people on the outside might make judgements about the way they are dealing with things: they haven’t got upset or they’re not coping but it proves that everyone takes it at their own pace.</p>
      <p>‘It’s much more interesting to watch the dynamics between the two of them than it would be to have them both sat crying every day.’</p>
