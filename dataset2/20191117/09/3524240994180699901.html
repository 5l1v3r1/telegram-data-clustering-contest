      <p><b> Liverpool</b> legend, Jamie Redknapp, has compared Nigeria and Leicester City midfielder to France coach, Didier Deschamps, due to his work rate and importance to his team.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has been one of Leicester’s top performance this season and the former Liverpool captain, a midfielder during his playing days expressed his admiration for the combative midfielder.</p>
      <p>“There are so many things to admire about Leicester under Brendan Rodgers, and Ndidi is one of them,” he wrote in an opinion page in the <i>dailymail</i>.</p>
      <p>“I was at the King Power Stadium to watch them beat Arsenal on Saturday evening and spoke to James Maddison afterwards. He hailed his Nigerian team-mate and rightly so.”</p>
      <p>Redknapp also believes the midfielder has been able to adequately fill the boots left behind by Chelsea star, Ngolo Kante.</p>
      <p>“When Leicester lost N’Golo Kante to Chelsea, we figured the Foxes would never get over it. How do you replace someone like that in your midfield?</p>
      <p>“Yet they got on with it and found Ndidi, a £17m buy from Genk. He makes what he does look simple, and enjoys the responsibility, too.</p>
      <p>“As well as his defensive expertise, Ndidi has other qualities, too. At 6ft, he is good in the air. He gets into the box, and I’m sure the King Power’s crossbar is still shaking from his ferocious shot on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“He has the right attitude, too,” he concluded.</p>
