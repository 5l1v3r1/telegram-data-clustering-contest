      <h2>The horse can be seen running around in circles in a distressing video</h2>

      <p>A heart wrenching video has shown a horse trembling with fear as a firework display goes off at a nearby pub.</p>
      <p>The horse at Prospect Farm, in Wirral, can be seen running around in a circle shaking as the fireworks are heard from a display being held at nearby pub, The Saughall.</p>
      <p>Farmer Philip Broster said the distressing video was filmed on November 9 as he claimed embers from a bonfire floated into and around a hay barn where the horses were being kept.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old said he and wife, Amy Broster, 26, "dread" Bonfire Night and live in fear of a fire starting or the animals being in distress.</p>
      <p>After being contacted by the ECHO, the pub's owners apologised to the horse and its owners and promised it wouldn't happen again.</p>
      <p>Mr Broster, who lives at the farm with his wife, parents and son, Harry, three, said: "It's so distressing for myself because I don't want there to be a fire.</p>
      <p>"It's not good for us and it's not good for the animals' welfare. The distress and the disturbance of it is horrible."</p>

      <p>The Saughall said: "We are now looking into the issues with the relevant advisers. We will release a further detailed statement once this has been completed."</p>
      <p>When approaching Bonfire Night, Mr Broster said the family usually take preventative steps to stop the horses from being affected by the loud bangs.</p>
      <p>This can include sedating the animals or making sure they are in a safe space.</p>
      <p>Before the pub's display, Mr Broster claims he approached the owner and was told the fireworks "wouldn't include rockets" and would begin at 7.30pm.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Broster said the display started half an hour earlier which he claims did not allow enough time to sedate the horses.</p>

      <p>Heartbreaking footage from the night, Mr Broster claimed, showed fireworks streaming into the sky above the hay barn as well as one of the horses in distress.</p>
      <p>A voice can be heard telling the horse: "It's ok, it's ok, good boy."</p>
      <p>Mr Broster said the farm had suffered two fires before, not because of fireworks, but the cost to repair the damage was up to £20,000.</p>
      <p>He said: "We're just trying to get our view out there how dangerous it could be."</p>
      <p>Videos of the farm on Bonfire Night are understood to have been widely shared on social media.</p>
      <p>On November 10, The Saughall Pub posted: "Thank you for all of those who attended our annual organised bonfire night event 9/11/19.</p>
      <p>"We are aware however of issues which have been raised through social media. We are now looking into the issues with the relevant advisers. We will release a further detailed statement once this has been completed.</p>
      <p>"A full risk assessment and relevant paperwork is available for anyone to view please email enquiries@saughallpubandkitchen.co.uk</p>
      <p>"In the meantime we will continue to serve our loyal customers in the usual way.</p>
      <p>"Merseyside Police have been informed of the situation and are working with us.</p>
      <p>"Many thanks."</p>
      <p>Marc Edmunds, tenant at Saughall Pub said: “The pub has traditionally held a bonfire and fireworks event in the past and we wanted to continue bringing the community together in this way.</p>
      <p>"We went through all the appropriate channels in advance to ensure we organised it in a safe and legal way, including seeking permission from the council, police and fire service.</p>
      <p>"Like others, we were shocked to see the video of the horse.</p>
      <p>"We are relieved that it is now OK and we won’t put on a similar event in the future without ensuring this kind of thing won’t happen again.</p>
      <p>"It was never our intention to cause any distress and can only apologise to the horse and the wider public.”</p>
