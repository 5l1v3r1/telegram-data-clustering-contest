      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> was ‘waiting for confirmation’ to be part of the Strictly Come Dancing 2020 tour <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/strictly-come-dancings-michelle-visage-snubbed-arena-tour-bosses-make-u-turn-11073510/">before she was snubbed from the line-up</a>.</p>
      <p>Seven celebrities from this year’s series are set to tour the UK for 33 live shows, including Sky Sports presenter Alex Scott, actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/catherine-tyldesley/">Catherine Tyldesley</a> and EastEnders star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emma-barton/">Emma Barton</a>, but earlier this month it was reported that RuPaul’s Drag Race judge was told she was ‘no longer needed’.</p>
      <p>‘She was asked her availability for the tour and was waiting for confirmation,’ a spokesperson for Michelle revealed.</p>
      <p>‘She’d have loved to have done it. She was available for every date of the tour and the organisers were very aware of this.’</p>
      <p>Michelle’s rep continued to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361974/michelle-visage-axed-from-ballroom-tour/">The Sun</a>: ‘But for whatever reason, they decided not to have Michelle on. There was no discussion of any other fee.’</p>

      <p>However, a Strictly insider told the publication that this was not the case.</p>

      <p>‘The reason Michelle is not doing the tour is she was already booked to do DragCon in London on January 18 and 19, which is the opening weekend of the tour,’ they said.</p>
      <p>‘She wouldn’t be available for four shows in Birmingham. So to say she had cleared her diary is not true.</p>
      <p>‘There was also some discussion about her fee. All celebrities are paid the same but Michelle wanted to be paid more.’</p>

      <p>Strictly Come Dancing, The Live Tour<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/when-is-the-strictly-come-dancing-live-tour-and-how-can-you-get-tickets-2-11071473/"> will be happening in January and February 2020</a> and will also see last year’s winner Stacey Dooley join the spectacle alongside judges Shirley Ballas, Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve heard so many amazing things about the live tour from my friends who’ve done it before,’ Emma enthused. ‘As a performer, nothing compares to being in the moment and actually going out and performing in front of a live audience.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t wait to do it all over again on tour.’</p>
      <p>Alex added: ‘I’m really excited for next year’s tour – I hope I’ll get the chance to perform some of my favourite routines again. Strictly has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I’m thrilled that I’ll get to dance for everyone who has voted for me on the TV series.’</p>
