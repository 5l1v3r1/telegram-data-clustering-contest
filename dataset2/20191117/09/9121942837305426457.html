      <p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — Syracuse University has suspended a fraternity and shut down social activities for all other fraternities for the rest of the semester after an African American student reported being called a racial slur.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Kent Syverud says the student told officials the slur came from a group of students and visitors on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Syverud said Sunday that some of the students accused of being involved are part of a fraternity, which has been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation.</p>
      <p>He said even though only one fraternity has been accused of being involved, all fraternity social events would be suspended.</p>
      <p>Syracuse is already investigating racist graffiti found inside a residence hall earlier this month.</p>
