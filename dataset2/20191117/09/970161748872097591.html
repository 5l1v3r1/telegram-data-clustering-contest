      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> is keeping tabs on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s situation at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> and would reportedly be keen on taking over at Spurs if the job becomes available.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach has been out of work for almost a year since leaving Manchester United last December, though he is believed to be itching for a return to management.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been linked with a host of clubs and is rumoured to be Real Madrid president Florentino Perez’s preferred choice to take over from Zinedine Zidane if and when he goes.</p>

      <p>However, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360791/jose-mourinho-tottenham-pochettino-real-madrid/">according to The Sun</a>, Mourinho has confided in friends that he would not necessarily accept Real’s advances while the possibility of taking over at Spurs exists.</p>
      <p>The self-proclaimed Special One would be interested in talking to the club should they part ways with Pochettino, who is under increasing pressure after a poor start to the season.</p>

      <p>Spurs have not won a Premier League match since beating Southampton at the end of September and sit in 14th place, 11 points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is believed to favour staying in the Premier League – and particularly London, where his family still live.</p>
      <p>Offering an insight into how Mourinho will approach his search for a new job, Glen Johnson – who played under the Portuguese coach – told <i>Express Sport</i>: ‘Jose is sitting in the shadows at the moment.</p>

      <p>‘He’s being patient and things change so quickly in football where a job that seems secure now, might not be in two months’ time.</p>
      <p>‘Arsenal and Tottenham are the two places where the doors could be open sooner but I don’t think I could see him at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>‘He’ll wait for it to unfold over Christmas and perhaps he’ll cherry-pick after that. But I don’t think he’s the type to rush and get a job just for the sake of getting one.’</p>
