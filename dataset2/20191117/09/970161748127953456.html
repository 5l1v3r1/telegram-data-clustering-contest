      <p>‘Ahh… she’s been living in a Sudha (white) country for all these years but still this child is Kaluer (darker) than us and you. How can that be?’ a shopkeeper in my hometown in Sri Lanka laughingly asked my parents.</p>
      <p>When this happened to me at just six years old, I turned to my parents in disbelief. Quick to spare me from any discomfort, my mum and dad politely smiled and ushered me out of the shop.</p>
      <p>This is one of my earliest recollections of experiencing negativity over the colour of my skin – but unfortunately not the last.</p>
      <p>As a British Asian growing up in the western world and going to a predominantly white school with mostly white friends, I am used to being the person who was ‘different’.</p>

      <p>But being the darkest member of my family has additional pressures. People on the outside wonder how I ended up so much darker and my parents were frequently asked by their friends, ‘Whose side of the family did she inherit her skin from?’</p>
      <p>Quick to rush to my defence they would proudly answer, ‘Faye got her unique and flawless complexion from both sides of the family’.</p>
      <p>Over the past few decades, the world of Bollywood has dominated celebrity culture in South Asia, with the likes of Shahrukh Khan and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/priyanka-chopra/">Priyanka Chopra</a> becoming the popular ideals of beauty.</p>
      <p>From a young age, I was quick to notice that the leading actors and actresses of these films all have a ‘fair’ complexion – one more aligned with westernised culture. In Sri Lanka, lighter skin is recognised as a social marker for the upper class and darker skin is associated with labour in the sun.</p>
      <p>This is reinforced through TV adverts for lightening soaps and creams. Sri Lanka’s shops and supermarkets are filled with such products.</p>
      <p>As strangers in my hometown in Sri Lanka jokingly branded me ‘chocolate’ and ‘Coca-Cola’, it made me think my dark complexion was the first thing people notice about me.</p>
      <p>Things finally came to a head in 2018 when, aged 26, I was asked by a family friend to be a bridesmaid in Sri Lanka for the first time.</p>

      <p>I was so excited but when the chief make-up artist pointed at me and said to her helpers, ‘I will sort this one out’, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy. Placing me in a chair, she started applying a thick foundation onto my face, my neck and even my arms, all while saying, ‘You know, even though you are dark, you are really beautiful’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Initially I took this as a compliment because I was pleased I could still be considered beautiful despite having darker skin – showing just how distorted my idea of beauty had become.</p>
      <p>After she had painted my mask on, I didn’t recognise the face I saw in the mirror. I was a different colour. What was worse was realising that none of the other bridesmaids’ faces were being painted like mine had been.</p>
      <p>Humiliated, I couldn’t help but start to cry. I just wanted the day to be over so that I could go home and scrub my face off. But everyone at the wedding told me I looked ‘beautiful’.</p>
      <p>Though one of the worst days of my life, it was also a blessing in disguise because that’s when I knew I liked my actual face – not the one I was given for a day.</p>
      <p>I finally got to experience what it would be like to be in ‘another person’s skin’ and I absolutely hated it.</p>
      <p>Given that most of my friends from the UK want to get a tan on holiday, I often find it confusing to reconcile two cultures that project conflicting ideals of beauty.</p>
      <p>At 28, I am proud of my Sri Lankan heritage and confident enough to no longer be apologetic for my colour.</p>
      <p>I feel guilty that my parents have been dragged into the ‘blame game’ debate and I guess I will never understand how it came to be that I ended up darker than both of my parents, brother and cousins. I am OK with it, though, because they are too.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It’s part of who I am and I shouldn’t feel obliged to change myself in order to ‘fit in’.</p>
      <p>Yes, sometimes there’s a worry at the back of my mind that I won’t meet someone because of my skin colour or that I am always going to be defined by how dark I am – but if that’s the case, they aren’t people I should be associating myself with.</p>
      <p>Unwilling to give in to the stereotypes so woven into the fabric of their culture, my parents’ attitudes have given me the courage to do the same.</p>
      <p>If I could go back and speak to the six-year-old Faye, who was embarrassed by the shopkeeper’s query over her colour, I would tell her that it’s better to be the ‘black sheep’ than the sheep who follows the crowd.</p>
