        <b>Snoop Dogg has stolen John Legend’s glory as People’s sexiest man alive by giving himself the title and his very own magazine cover.</b>
      </p>
      <p>John, 40, earned the most flattering accolade of his career so far when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/chrissy-teigen-fulfils-dream-boning-sexiest-man-alive-john-legend-honoured-people-title-11088683/">People unveiled him as their eye candy for 2019 last week,</a> following in the footsteps of Idris Elba, Chris Hemsworth and Dwayne Johnson.</p>
      <p>What company to be in!</p>
      <p>Well, People have never had a rapper as their special cover star – until now, that is, with Snoop, 48, declaring himself the sexiest man alive instead of John.</p>
      <p>Snoop, real name Calvin Broadus, shared a brilliant doctored version of John’s cover with his head replacing the Ordinary People singer’s. While John’s suit is still in place, Snoop has replaced his undone navy bow tie with a bandana pattern.</p>

      <p>The headline reads: ‘Snoop Dogg. How a crip took your chick.’</p>
      <p>‘Thank. You,’ Snoop simply wrote on Instagram, graciously accepting his new honour.</p>

      <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say.</p>
      <p>John admitted he was ‘excited’ and ‘a little scared’ with the ‘pressure’ of being named sexiest man alive.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Everyone’s going to be picking me apart to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title. I’m [also] following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!’</p>

      <p>The All Of Me singer added on Twitter: ‘1995 John would be very perplexed to be following 2018 @IdrisElba as #SexiestManAlive. Hell, 2019 John is about as equally perplexed but thank you @People for finding me sexy. I’ll take it.’</p>
      <p>But perhaps no one was more thrilled than John’s wife Chrissy Teigen, who joked: ‘My secret is out. I have fulfilled my dream of having boned @people’s sexiest man alive!! an honor!!!!! [sic].’</p>
      <p>The former model added to People: ‘I cannot WAIT for people to get mad about John being the sexiest man alive. it’s my new Starbucks holiday cup.’</p>
      <p>She even changed her Twitter bio to: ‘Currently sleeping with people’s sexiest man alive.’</p>
