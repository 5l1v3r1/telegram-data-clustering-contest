      <p>The Peoples Democratic Party on Saturday urged those who voted in Saturday’s governorship polls in   Kogi and Bayelsa states  to protect their votes.</p>
      <p>The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, also told  the Independent National  Electoral Commission and  security agencies to ensure that nothing happened to the ballots.</p>
      <p>He called on the Inspector-General of Police of Police, Mohammed Adamu, and the military  to protect the people in their quest to protect their votes.</p>
      <p>Ologbondiyan accused  the All Progressives Congress in Kogi State  of moving around collation centres with hoodlums and compromised security officials, shooting and disrupting collation processes in their alleged desperation to subvert the aspiration of the people.</p>
      <p>He urged the IG to beef up security at the collation centres to ensure that only legitimate votes counted.</p>
