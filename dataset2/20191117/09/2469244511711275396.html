      <p>A woman is believed to be in a critical condition in hospital this morning after a serious crash on the M5 yesterday.</p>
      <p>The incident involved a car and a lorry, with firefighters having to cut the female car driver out of the vehicle after it became wedged underneath the lorry.</p>
      <p>Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the southbound carriageway between junctions 22 and 23 following a report of a two-vehicle crash just before 6am on Saturday morning (November 16).</p>
      <p>All traffic had to be stopped, resulting in hue tailbacks up to six miles long - with some drivers reporting being stranded for up to five hours.</p>
      <p>This is what we know so far.</p>
