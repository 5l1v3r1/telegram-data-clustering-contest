      <h2>This is where you can catch your buses</h2>

      <p>Nottingham's Victoria Bus Station will be closed for a second day while work is carried out to solve electrical issues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Nottingham City Council</a> announced on Saturday, November 16, that the station's travel centre had closed because of a power outage.</p>
      <p>Engineers tried to rectify the issues, but at 2pm the station was closed with buses diverted to other stops in the city.</p>
      <p>This morning (Sunday, November 17), the council announced that the station would be closed for a second day.</p>
      <p>Commuters wanting to access buses from the station are being advised to now catch them at three stops.</p>
      <p>Burton Street (Stop T8) will be used for the Rainbow One, Rapid One, and the Two.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Upper Parliament Street</a> (Stop U1) will be used for the Red Arrow.</p>
      <p>The Rose of England (Stop T6) will be used for the Threes and Pronto</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the bus station said last night: "The Victoria Centre bus station will remain closed tomorrow for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>"Engineers from the power company have been working on electrical problems today and we hope to be able to reopen on Monday. We're really sorry for the inconvenience."</p>
