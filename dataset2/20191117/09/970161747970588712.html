      <h1>I won I'm A Celebrity but I'm still jealous of this year's contestants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:47:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/vicky-pattison/" target="_blank">Vicky Pattison</a></address>
      <p>With the new series of I’m A Celebrity about to start, it’s got me feeling all nostalgic.</p>
      <p>It’s so hard for me not to feel a teeny bit of jealous of all the people heading into the jungle because, for me, I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here was the most amazing thing I’ve done in my career.</p>
      <p>If they embrace it, the adventure that this year’s celebs are about to embark on is nothing short of life changing.</p>
      <p>Of course, not everyone does. Every year when you sit down to watch it you can spot a mile off who is just there for the paycheque, who needs their pension subsidising and who’s just had an expensive divorce.</p>
      <p>But I like to believe those camp mates are few and far between – more often than not people are there to be part of one of the biggest institutions in British television. </p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They’re there because they’re fans of the show; because they watch it year in, year out with their kids; because they love <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-and-dec/">Ant and Dec</a>; because they fancy Medic Bob. (No? Oh just me then…)</p>

      <p>They go to challenge themselves, prove that they’re stronger than people think they are… ultimately they go for the adventure. </p>
      <p>And that is what makes the show brilliant. Well, that and you get to watch a WAG<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/im-a-celebritys-bushtucker-trials-normalise-animal-cruelty-and-must-end-11073538/"> eat kangaroo balls</a> – who doesn’t love that? </p>
      <p>I have always wanted to go on the show and when they finally agreed to see me at ITV I knew this was my moment – I had one chance to impress them and I was not going to waste it. </p>
      <p>I answered all their questions honestly and openly, we joked around that I was open to the idea of a jungle romance, and that – just like all reasonable humans – I was scared of gin and puppies and definitely didn’t want any trials involving them. </p>
      <p>At the end of the meeting the producers asked: ‘Is there anything you want to ask us?’ </p>
      <p>I looked them square in the eyes and said: ‘I don’t want to ask you anything, I just wanted to let you know I’ll be good at this.’ </p>
      <p>And the rest is history! </p>

      <p>I went into the jungle straight off the back of my time on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/geordie-shore/">Geordie Shore</a> and people had only seen that version me. </p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They saw me as a heavy-drinking, argumentative and controversial young girl – someone who allowed herself to get swept up in that environment and had subsequently lost a sense of herself. </p>
      <p>I became a caricature of myself and I was keen to put that image behind me and show the nation that there was more to me than slut dropping and Jägerbombs. </p>
      <p>Unbeknownst to me at the time, when I walked into the jungle as a late arrival, social media exploded with comments like ‘get her out,’ ‘she’s going to ruin it’ and ‘oh god why have they put her in there.’ </p>
      <p>I’m not sensitive, I get it – having only seen that side of me how could they expect me to do anything other than turn their beloved jungle upside down with ‘tashing on’ and shouting. </p>

      <p>But something brilliant happened: I just went in and I was myself – determined, compassionate, kind, resilient, strong, up for a laugh and a real team player – and within 24 hours I was the favourite to win. </p>
      <p>And that is the beauty of the jungle. In one fell swoop I was able to show an entire nation my true colours. It gives people the opportunity to change perceptions, and I think that’s pretty incredible. </p>
      <p>I had so many highlights in there – too many to mention – and I made some amazing pals including Jorgie Porter, George Shelley, Susannah Constantine and Tony Hadley. </p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Then of course I found my jungle bestie, Ferne McCann. We’ve been through so much together and formed a very unlikely life-long friendship. I’ll always be grateful to the jungle for that! </p>
      <p>For me, as a Geordie, meeting Ant and Dec was a career highlight. People always say ‘don’t meet your heroes,’ but it gives me so much pleasure to announce, in this instance, that the sentiment is completely incorrect. </p>

      <p>They are amazing! Fun, friendly, supportive – just unbelievable balls of energy and the driving force behind the entire show. I know I am biased but they are bloody lovely. </p>
      <p>It isn’t all lols though and there can be some pretty testing times out there too. I know hunger gets to a lot of people – but quite frankly, since I’d been on a strict diet (panicking about the bloody shower scene) I found the constant diet of rice and beans – with the odd wallaby tail thrown in for good measure – quite a luxury. </p>
      <p>My advice to this year’s camp mates would be to relax and enjoy it. Feel the gravity of what you’re actually doing and be grateful for the experience – because all too quickly it will be over and you’ll be back at home watching it on the sofa, feeling more than a tinge of jealousy (like me!) </p>
      <p>Other than that, here is my sure-fire checklist for making sure you smash I’m A Celeb 2019. FYI I gave this same advice to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/10/joel-dommett-shares-first-wedding-photo-wife-hannah-rocked-trainers-suit-10719936/">Joel Dommett</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/emily-atack/">Emily Atack</a> before they went in, and they did alright, so it can’t be too bad, can it? </p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Right, here it goes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not be a fanny in the trials. You can scream, you can shout, you can whinge all you want – but get it done. There are hungry people back at camp and nothing sours a mood more than returning empty-handed to a waiting crowd of ex-professional footballers and girl band members – they get HANGRY. </li>
        <li>Help out in camp. You literally are left to your own devices within the camp. There aren’t any crew members who pop in with bacon and eggs and fresh knickers when the cameras aren’t rolling. It’s a real life jungle and there’s a lot to be done – so pitch in. Collect water, empty the dunny, volunteer to do the washing – just be present and a team player. No one likes a work-shy princess in camp. </li>
        <li>And finally, try not to sleep through the day. Days can be long in camp and at times – if you aren’t doing a trial or a dingo dollar – a little bit boring. But honestly, no one likes watching people sleep – it’s weird. Remember you’re there to entertain. So do it! </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Well that’s all I’ve got! It feels lovely to be imparting my pearls of jungley wisdom for this year’s camp mates. I wish them all the best of luck! I suppose all that’s left to say is: roll on Sunday night!</p>
