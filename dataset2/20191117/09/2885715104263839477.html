      <p>Christian Bale and Matt Damon starrer sports drama Ford v Ferrari is set to win at the domestic (North American) box office. According to Variety, the James Mangold directorial will earn approximately 29 million dollars in 3,528 screens.</p>
      <p>Penned by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller, Ford v Ferrari is about Carroll Shelby, an automotive designer who was given the task to build a car for Ford capable of defeating the reigning champion Ferrari at 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, world’s oldest active sports car endurance race. This was supposed to be unthinkable back then.</p>

      <p>Ford v Ferrari has evoked a positive critical reception. It holds a 92 per cent rating at Rotten Tomatoes. The critical consensus reads, “Ford v Ferrari delivers all the polished auto action audiences will expect — and balances it with enough gripping human drama to satisfy non-racing enthusiasts.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>’ Andrew Amsan <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/ford-v-ferrari-movie-review-rating-6121828/">gave the film 4 stars</a>. He wrote, “It’s a great relief that the movie, unlike most sports flicks, features no montages and hazy flashback scenes. It’s all in the moment. The biggest challenge for any movie based on real-life incidents is to keep the audience hooked as the eventual outcome is no secret, and Ford v Ferrari manages to do that, thanks to its lead characters.”</p>
      <p>“Your heart is bound to race as Miles hits those tight corners, you will feel a rush of blood when Shelby takes those bold decisions from the pit stop, and at the end of the movie, you’ll realise, it is not all about winning,” he added.</p>
