      <p>The Churchill Dam in Nelson Mandela Bay's catchment area is overflowing, following the good rain that fell in the Kareedouw area last week.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson for the SA Weather Service in Port Elizabeth, Garth Sampson says some follow-up rain fell overnight on Saturday into Sunday along the coast and the adjacent interior, with between 7 and 16 mm in Port Elizabeth, 2.6 mm in Kareedouw, 8.4 mm at Patensie, but nothing at Joubertina.</p>
      <p>He says he visited the Churchill Dam on Sunday, and it was overflowing.</p>
      <p>Sampson says the dam's official level was at 100.21 percent, and this overflowing water will gradually run into the Impofu Dam, which is currently at 16 percent of capacity.</p>
      <p>He added, however, that this overflow was very slight and there was not much water running to the Impofu.</p>
      <p>Sampson says the drought is by no means broken, and water should still be used sparingly.</p>
      <p>He says no rain is expected in the Bay's catchment area for the next week.</p>
