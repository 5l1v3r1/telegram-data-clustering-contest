      <h1>Kerevi wants to ditch Wallabies and jump ship for 2023 RWC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:40:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Wallabies vice-captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/reds/players/samu-kerevi/">Samu Kerevi</a> says he wants to ditch <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> and line out for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/fiji">Fiji</a> at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Fiji Sun Times</i>, Kerevi suggested he will be unable to play for <a href="http://www.rugby.com.au/">Australia</a> at the tournament due to Giteau’s Law. The RA protocol states that a player needs to have a minimum of 60 Test caps for Australia before he can be selected while playing abroad.</p>
      <p>Kerevi is signed to a lucrative three years deal to play for Suntory in Japan.</p>
      <p>“My manager has told me to go to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> so that I can aim to play for Fiji in the next Rugby World Cup,” Kerevi <a href="https://fijisun.com.fj/2019/11/17/wallaby-vice-captain-samu-kerevi-wants-to-be-a-flying-fijian/">told the Fijian news outlet.</a></p>
      <p>“It (is) all in the air for me to focus on Japan.</p>
      <p>“I cannot play for the Wallabies because I cannot reach the threshold of 60 caps, which they are trying to lower.”</p>
      <p>Born in Viseisei, Fiji, he moved with his family to Australia at the age of four, but did not gain Australian citizenship until August, 2016. His father Nimilote represented Fiji at football, and his cousin is former Wallaby Radike Samo who played 23 tests for Australia.</p>
      <p>“The biggest drive here is my two brothers Josua and Jone.</p>
      <p>“They know how to speak three languages which why I am a bit jealous. Also, to continue my business degree studies with University of Queensland.”</p>
      <p>He made his test debut in Australia’s 39-28 defeat by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> in Brisbane on 11 June, 2016, playing in the unfamiliar position of inside-centre.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/rugby-australia-working-group-will-question-every-wallabies-player-after-world-cup-flop/">He was rated the most damaging ball runner</a> in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> 2019 after finishing the season as the<br/>competition’s leading player for ball carries (220) as well as the second best for defenders beaten (71), offloads (26), and in the top five for clean breaks (26).</p>
