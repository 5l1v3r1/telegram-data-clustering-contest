      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - The leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party is rejecting calls for an overhaul of the accord underpinning Merkel's often-fractious coalition government.</p>
      <p>Merkel's center-right Union bloc leads an alliance with the center-left Social Democrats. Halfway through the parliamentary term, the Social Democrats are choosing a new leadership and are expected to decide next month whether to stay in the coalition.</p>
      <p>One Social Democratic leadership contender has advocated an overhaul of the coalition accord drawn up last year, as has a prominent lawmaker in Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.</p>
      <p>But CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has made clear ahead of a party conference this week that she's not interested. Kramp-Karrenbauer told Sunday's edition of the Welt am Sonntag newspaper: "The coalition agreement is valid, and it most certainly will not be renegotiated."</p>
