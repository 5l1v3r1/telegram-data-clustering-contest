      <h1>Scouting report: Dream European debut for Bristol Bears' Welsh fly-half rising star Ioan Lloyd</h1>
      <h2>We shine a spotlight on the performance against Zebre of the 18-year-old everyone is talking about</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:18:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Evans</a></address>
      <p>A mere 18 years old, barely out of school, wearing the number-10 jersey for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-bears">Bristol Bears</a> at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>No problem at all for Ioan Lloyd.</p>
      <p>Not only did the rising star score another try, not only did he knock over eight kicks out of eight, he was man of the match to boot in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/match-reports/bristol-bears-run-eight-tries-3546577">59-21</a> European Challenge Cup victory over Zebre Rugby.</p>
      <p>Lloyd didn't have a massive impact in the early stages of the contest as the Italian Pro14 outfit started pretty well in an end-to-end opening.</p>
      <p>Lloyd's first conversion was a simple one but his second was a tricky touchline effort after Toby Fricker had scored in the left corner.</p>
      <p>In the mean-time he was passing crisply and looking for gaps in the visitors' defence, not afraid to thrown in a jink and a step.</p>
      <p>In the 25th minute, the former Wales U18s player burst into life. After a lot of crabbing and scrappy play from both sides he picked up the ball on the Bristol 10m line, accelerated in field then headed for a hole between two Zebre players.</p>
      <p>Neither touched him as he streaked through the gap, got up to top speed and streaked away to secure his side's bonus-point try.</p>
      <p>After adding the simple two points a 40m penalty followed. In fact, none of his eight shots at goal went anywhere other than between the sticks.</p>
      <p>Lloyd's influence on the game lessened once Callum Sheedy replaced Charles Piutau in the 46th minute and Lloyd went to full-back.</p>

      <p>It also coincided with Zebre's resurgence and Bristol's indiscipline; meaning Lloyd had little ball in the opposition half for a good 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>He did execute a try-saving tackle on wing Pierre Bruno, though, by dragging his right leg into touch as Zebre looked to make use of an overlap.</p>
      <p>After converting Charlie Powell's 77th try from wide on the right, Lloyd made way for Andy Uren to a rapturous applause from the Ashton Gate crowd.</p>
      <p>A couple of minute's later, he was announced as man of the match. Not a bad maiden start, all told.</p>
      <p>"I've always said if you're good enough, you're old enough," said DoR Pat Lam after the match. "If you perform, you'll get the games."</p>
      <p>On this evidence, the former Clifton College pupil will get plenty more opportunities this season and for years to come.</p>
      <p>"I'm really impressed with him," said number eight Luke Hamilton, who was also making his first senior start for the club.</p>
      <p>"He's good enough to step up and, as he proved today, he's a great talent. When people say he's 18 you have to stop and think: Is he actually 18?</p>
      <p>"He pulled the strings for us today. He really led our attack and, off the tee, he was outstanding as well.</p>
      <p>"It's always good to have someone young coming through."</p>
