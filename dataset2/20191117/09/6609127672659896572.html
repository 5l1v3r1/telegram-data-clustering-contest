      <p>The injured boy, 14, and the 43-year-old police officer, who have not been named, were both taken to nearby Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy for treatment.</p>
      <p>It is understood the schoolboy spent two nights in hospital.</p>
      <p>PD Indy, who has been praised in the past for tracing missing people, has been taken off duty and could be put down after an investigation.</p>
      <p>The details of what caused the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4518294/police-scotland-dog-children-search/">police dog</a> to lash out are unclear.</p>
      <p>Inspector Hazel Crielly of Kirkcaldy police office, said: “A 14-year-old boy and a police dog handler were injured by a police dog on Friday, November 8.</p>
      <p>“Around 11pm, the male officer and the police dog were assisting in the search for two teenagers in a field, near Gateside Cottages, north of Glenrothes.</p>
      <p>“The teenager and the 43-year-old officer were both taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.</p>
      <p>“The officer was released following treatment. The 14-year-old boy has also been released from hospital.</p>
      <p>"Inquiries into the incident are ongoing."</p>
      <p>General purpose police dogs are highly trained and can be involved in various police activities such as looking for missing people or individuals who may be evading cops, and searching for weapons and evidence.</p>
      <p>Indy was branded a hero just two months ago after locating a 91-year-old man with dementia who had gone missing in Kirkcaldy.</p>
      <p>After three hours of searching in and around the area, Indy was tasked with helping the operation and found him within 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The man was suffering from hypothermia and was taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>Following Friday’s incident in Glenrothes, it is understood Indy has been returned to the police kennels and will not be deployed again until a full review of what happened has been carried out.</p>
      <p>The dog could be destroyed pending the outcome of that investigation.</p>
