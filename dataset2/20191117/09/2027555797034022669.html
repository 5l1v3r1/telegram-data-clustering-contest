      <h1>Balasaheb Thackeray, Shiv Sena and the son of the soil</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:20:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/mrityunjay-bose" target="_blank">Mrityunjay Bose</a></address>
      <p>Bal Thackeray is an important icon in Maharashtra, both politically and socially. A fierce campaigner of the 'sons of the soil' theory, Thackeray started his career as a cartoonist in a daily, went on to start his own Marathi weekly 'Marmik' to express his views, and six years later founded the Shiv Sena in order to benefit the Marathi community in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Apart from regional politics, Thackeray was also known for his ardent anti-Pakistan stand, especially when it came to cricket, stalling multiple India-Pakistan matches in the state with Shiv Sainiks protesting and digging up pitches in protest of the scheduled matches between the two countries.   </p>
