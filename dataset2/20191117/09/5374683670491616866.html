      <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday supported recent increases in gas and fuel protests which have sparked protests across Iran.</p>
      <p>“Some people are no doubt worried by this decision ... but sabotage and arson is done by hooligans not our people. The counter-revolution and Iran’s enemies have always supported sabotage and breaches of security and continue to do so,” Khameini said on Iranian state television.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately some problems were caused, a number of people lost their lives and some centers were destroyed,” he added.</p>
      <p>Protests erupted Saturday after the Iranian government raised the cost of regular gasoline to 15,000 rials ($0.13) a liter from 10,000 rials and instituted fuel rations. Additional liters would cost 30,000 rials.</p>
      <p>One death was confirmed in the southeastern city of Sirjan. Several other deaths were reported on social media.</p>
      <p>The increase in fuel prices was done in response the economic crisis Iran faces as a result of the renewed sanctions imposed by the United States.</p>
