      <p>Now that the voting, taxpaying public has spoken regarding I-976 and $30 car tabs, I might offer some insight to the state, and in particular to the Department of Transportation:</p>
      <p>Respect the voters. Our pockets are not bottomless treasure chests to be pilfered. Roads and transportation are critical. So is fiscal responsibility. Charging extra for new and shiny license plates was a head fake of proportions; and insulting as well.</p>
      <p>I support the gas tax. Despite it being the second highest in the nation; it is the fairest way of raising revenue for roads. The more you drive, the more you pay to use the roads. Gas guzzlers/SUVs pay more for the choice of what they drive. Donâ€™t go after those who drive electric cars. They are doing the environment good, and to now back stab them for fees is deceit. Rather, slowly increase their fees to pay for charging stations, or raise the fees for charging.</p>
      <p>A few cents a gallon at the pumps is easier to swallow than hundreds in the form on car tabs, and the host of other head-fake fees. We do not need another bureaucracy to study, staff and monitor our every move, invading privacy, to have us install monitors and pay by the mile. How do you enforce such a bad idea? More government staff, of course. Just keep things status quo. Increase the gas tax on a slightly and slowly basis.</p>
