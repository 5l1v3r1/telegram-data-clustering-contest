      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:55:43+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino has emerged as a key piece of Jurgen Klopp's attacking puzzle - and he insists he is happy to continue being a team player.</p>
      <p>Firmino has often been hailed as the man who knits together the Reds' powerful front three to bring out the best in Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>He has now opened up on his exact role in the side and states he will play wherever it takes to win games.</p>
      <p>It has certainly done the trick for the Brazilian so far, with the Champions League winners sitting top of the Premier League table after last weekend's win over title rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>

      <p>Speaking to Premier League Productions, Firmino said of his eight assists this campaign: “That is just me, my personality, to try to be a good and humble guy.</p>
      <p>“To try to help my team in the best way with assists and goals. I like that, I like to win all the time, and for that I will always be like this.</p>
      <p>“I am a guy who respects my position on the pitch. Where the team needs me, I will play. As a No.9, but sometimes I play as a No.10, and I try to give my best.</p>

      <p>“As I mentioned before, I always want to help my team as best as I can and to always be chasing the win, always winning games. That is what matters the most."</p>
      <p>Firmino also believes he has simply gone from strength to strength since moving to the Premier League in 2015.</p>
      <p>“I think I improved a lot in every way: physically, tactically, mentally, I learned a bit of every aspect.</p>
      <p>“But I do not want to stop here. I want to keep improving - I always want more, I have big goals, I want to keep winning titles with this club and that is it.”</p>
