      <p>Maybe their papas never told them about right and wrong.</p>
      <p>All three defendants were found guilty of manslaughter, assault and other charges Friday in connection with a gas explosion in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a> that caused the collapse of three buildings -- including one where <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Drea de Matteo</a>, a star of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">"The Sopranos,"</a> lived.</p>
      <p>The March 2015 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters">blast</a> in the East Village section of Manhattan killed two people and resulted from an illegally rigged gas line, authorities said.</p>

      <p>“Unbeknownst to the people who were walking down the street, driving down the street, there was a virtual bomb lurking under the East Village,” Assistant District Attorney Randolph Clarke said in his opening statement, according to <a href="https://abc7ny.com/all-3-defendants-guilty-in-deadly-2015-east-village-explosion/5699774/">WABC-TV in New York</a>.</p>
      <p>An employee and a customer of a sushi restaurant in one of the buildings were both killed.</p>
      <p>A few days after the tragedy, de Matteo, who played Adriana La Cerva on the hit TV show that ran 1999-2007, told the New York Post she was in Los Angeles at the time when a friend called to tell her what happened.</p>

      <p>“She said, ‘Turn on the TV! Your building’s on fire!” de Matteo <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/04/02/drea-de-matteo-opens-up-about-losing-her-home-in-second-ave-explosion/">told the Post</a>. “I said, ‘You’re out of your freaking mind.’ Then [my children and I] watched our house fall to the ground on television.”</p>
      <p>The three men convicted were a building owner, plumber and contractor. They are scheduled to be sentenced in January.</p>
