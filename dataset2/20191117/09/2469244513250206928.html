      <h1>Britain prepares for -5C freeze ahead of 'collapsed polar vortex'</h1>
      <h2>Temperatures will plummet over the coming days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T09:45:41+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Lo, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Forecasters have told Brits to prepare for more cold weather, with temperatures set to drop to -5C in some places.</p>
      <p>Last week saw snow fall for many areas, including Dartmoor and Exmoor, whilst other parts of the UK are still recovering from severe flooding in what has been described as the 'wettest ever Autumn'.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency still has 68 flood warnings and 106 flood alerts across the southwest and northeast areas, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-forecast-flood-chaos-20898653">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Although there are no such warnings in place for Devon and Cornwall, it will certainly get colder over the next few days, with temperatures set to drop to below freezing.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Sophie Yeomans said that although the wet conditions are easing off Brits are set for more  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a>  woes as temperatures predicted to drop as low as a chilling -5C next week.</p>

      <p>It comes as weather experts are suggesting a 'collapsed polar vortex' is predicted to bring 'severe' weather to Europe and parts of the UK need to be braced to feel the bite of subzero temperatures.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists are warning "severe" conditions are in store for the continent after snowstorms ravaged southeast France, causing at least one death.</p>

      <p>Nowhere in the UK will be spared from the chill, with forecasters predicting the mercury will drop to the single-digit highs across the country today and Monday.</p>
      <p>Here in the South West it looks set to be the coldest on Monday with temperatures dropping to 0C or below in both  <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/">Devon</a>  and Cornwall, according to the Met Office.</p>
      <p>BBC Weather presenter Helen Willetts has been forecasting some of the cold that is set to take its grip on much of Europe.</p>
      <p>She said: “The central area of the Mediterranean looking to have some more severe weather.</p>
      <p>"Strong winds continue to push that water and those winds and that rain northwards.</p>

      <p>“Heavy snowfall once again across the Alpine region.</p>
      <p>“To the east of that temperatures are well above average.</p>
      <p>“Temperatures will steadily rise this week across Scandinavia but it’s still cold here, we’ve still got some snow to come.</p>
      <p>“But we’re got more of that rain to come on Monday in very similar areas with quite disturbed weather to come.”</p>
      <p>Meteorologist Andrej Flis told  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1205297/bbc-weather-europe-warning-polar-vortex-snow-winter-floods-snowstorm">the Express </a> : “The weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex is well underway.</p>

      <p>“In the past days, the polar vortex reached 40-year record strength for this time of year. It would likely strengthen even further, but its rise to power was stopped and reversed, due to two pressure/temperature waves that press onto the vortex.</p>
      <p>“That reduces the speed of the stratospheric polar jet stream.</p>
      <p>“That is a strong sign of a collapsed polar vortex, and high probability of a sudden stratospheric warming event by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“What all this means for our weather? Well, a collapsed vortex always greatly increases the chances for winter weather towards Europe.”</p>
