        <b>The Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has told the party's Ard Fheis that there must be a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ms McDonald told members that it would be a red line for the party in considering entering government after the next election.</p>
      <p>She said there needs to be a referendum on Irish unity in the next five years with the party passing a motion that movement towards it would be a condition of entering government.</p>
      <p>She said the "days of partition are numbered" and that "Brexit has changed everything".</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald said: "The Irish government and all who say that now is not the time to speak of unity are wrong.</p>
      <p>"A referendum on unity will happen, as set-out in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
      <blockquote>"It is not a question of if, but a question of when.</blockquote>
      <p>The government must convene an All-Ireland Forum "in the next five years", she told delegates.</p>

      <p>In a pre-general election speech in Derry last night , Ms McDonald made a raft of promises.</p>
      <p>She pledged to undertake the largest public house building programme in the history of the state, and to cut rents by an average of €1,500 a year through tax reliefs.</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald said an NHS for Ireland needs to be established with a view to being an all-island operation if a border poll passes</p>
      <p>She committed to making childcare a public service, and much cheaper, while also scrapping third level fees.</p>
      <p>The Sinn Féin leader said a living wage would be introduced with them in government and that the retirement age would be brought back down to 65.</p>
      <p>She also spoke about a green new deal promising more details in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Ms McDonald was critical of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, saying they were "bad for your health" and have "have short-changed you" when it comes to quality of life.</p>
      <p>However, she said her party will talk and listen after the next election with a view to entering government.</p>
      <h3>Michelle O’Neill re-elected</h3>
      <p>Earlier in the evening, Michelle O’Neill was re-elected as vice-president of the party.</p>
      <p>She said she was "really honoured" for the endorsement of Sinn Féin members, and looks forward to continuing the party's "important work" in her role.</p>
      <p>Ms O'Neill said: “Working alongside Mary Lou McDonald and our senior team I want to maximise the positive growth and development of the party across Ireland.</p>
      <p>“It’s our ambition to drive a progressive political agenda for change across Ireland.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to transforming our country and uniting Ireland," she concluded.</p>
