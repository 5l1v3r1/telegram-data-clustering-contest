        <b>No matter what obstacle is thrown her way, Karen Taylor (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lorraine-stanley/">Lorraine Stanley</a>) always manages to get by in EastEnders, but lately she’s been struggling financially, and thus has been borrowing money from Ben (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) and Tubbs’ money-lending operation, and she struggles to meet the re-payments in the coming episodes — which is where Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) comes in.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With financial struggles aplenty, Karen borrows once more from Ben and Tubbs. Ben orders his mate to let Karen off on another payment — but Tubbs ignores such a request and demands that Karen pay up.</p>
      <p>Later, Karen discusses the matter with Billy, and he suggests that — in addition to her job at the launderette — perhaps she could get a second job to help with the repayments. Never one to miss an opportunity, Karen uses Billy’s words against him and ends up securing herself a job at E20.</p>

      <p>Naturally, Billy is rather worried about how Karen will cope but, as the night of her trial shift arrives, Karen delivers — and Billy is shocked. As a result, he begins to see her in a whole new light.</p>

      <p>Billy’s certainly helped Karen out of a pickle, but — what with him starting to see her in a whole new light — could romance perhaps ensue between the two characters?</p>
      <p>Neither Billy nor Karen has had much luck in the romance department as of late, so they certainly deserve a little bit of happiness, that’s for sure.</p>
      <p>Mind you, Karen’s made her concerns about her family aligning themselves with the Mitchell clan known to Keanu (Danny Walters) in the past, so perhaps she’ll steer clear as a result of this factor alone?</p>
