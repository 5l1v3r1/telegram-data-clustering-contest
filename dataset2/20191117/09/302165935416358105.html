      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 17 — Asean and China have agreed to conduct another maritime exercise to promote peace in the region.</p>
      <p>Minister of Defence, Mohamad Sabu said the 10 Asean members and China had agreed in principle to take part in the second multi-lateral naval drills.</p>
      <p>“We have agreed to conduct the second maritime exercise. However, we did not discuss in details when and where it will be held.</p>
      <p>“The joint naval exercise is another effort by Asean and China to ensure peace and stability in the region,” he told reporters here today.</p>
      <p>When asked whether the maritime exercise would become an annual event, Mohamad said it has not been decided yet.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mohamad attended the Asean+1 (China) Retreat. Mohamad is in Bangkok for the 13th Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) Retreat and 6th ADMM-PLUS. Thailand is holding the Asean Chair this year.</p>
