      <h1>Bella Thorne celebrates ‘getting her period’ by dancing around in a bikini</h1>

      <p>Apparently it’s a good time to be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bella-thorne/">Bella Thorne</a> right now, as the model shared a rather candid routine into celebrating getting her period.</p>
      <p>Indeed.</p>
      <p>The author/actor/singer/director wanted to let us all know it was that time of the month this weekend as she shared some throwback shots of her partying in a bikini and generally loving life.</p>
      <p>You can hardly fault her for doing her thing and if we can’t well celebrate what we want in 2019 then when can we, eh?</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the 22-year-old shared three shots of herself in a black, string bikini on what appeared to be a boat.</p>
      <p>‘I woke up with my period and this is how excited I am,’ she wrote, with her face clearly epically joyous at whatever she was celebrating at the time, as she held a beer.</p>

      <p>The shots were a throwback to when she was merrily dancing on a yacht during the 4 July celebrations while vacationing off the coast of Sicily.</p>

      <p>As you do.</p>
      <p>Most of her followers ignored the whole period note as they chimed in on how gorgeous the star’s smile was, with one hailing her a ‘goddess’.</p>
      <p>It comes after Bella <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/miracle-bella-thorne-wearing-clothes-jokes-nude-selfies-11147639/">joked it was a ‘miracle’ she was wearing clothes</a> recently, as she stepped into her wardrobe and picked something other than a bikini.</p>
      <p>Last week she posted a series of selfies online wearing a white ensemble that consisted of a white, button up and a ripped miniskirt.</p>

      <p>Evidently feeling herself in the matching outfit, Bella posed in the mirror for a bunch of selfies, zoomed in at different angles.</p>
      <p>She wrote in the caption, with what we can only imagine to be a smirk: ‘It’s a miracle I’m covered ;).’</p>
      <p>With her newly-greened hair, fans were going wild for the outfit and vibe, as they flocked to the comments section.</p>
      <p>We can see where her caption has come from as even though she’s outside, in public, and apparently the ‘right’ thing to do is to not be naked, the star is often sharing pics of herself in various states of undress for sometimes no other reason than that she ruddy feels like it, ok?</p>
      <p>Last week she shared a shot of herself in the shower covering her breasts and turning away from the camera in a duo of arty shots, while last month she shared a topless shot of herself posing in the mirror.</p>

      <p>It comes after, in July, Bella<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/17/bella-thorne-leaks-nudes-take-power-back-threats-hacker-9974751/"> leaked her own nude images</a> after she was threatened by a hacker who attempted to blackmail the star.</p>
      <p>More power to you, Bella.</p>
