      <h1>What Kind of Milk Is Really the Standard at Starbucks?</h1>

      <p>Unless you specify otherwise, your Starbucks latte will be made with 2 percent milk . . . but that wasn't always the case. When Starbucks first opened in 1971, all lattes and milk-based drinks were made with whole milk because former CEO Howard Schultz wanted to use the milk that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Italians-Drink-Coffee-41906929">Italians drink with their coffee</a>. "Originally, <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/2016/12/01/life/final-note/starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-steps-down">Schultz only allowed whole milk</a> in stores," because he strove to serve only "Italian-style espresso drinks," NPR reported.</p>
      <p>While whole milk was the standard for more than 30 years, customers began to voice their opinions and demand a change, so Starbucks "eliminated all artificial trans fat and made <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/about-us/company-information/starbucks-company-timeline">2 percent milk the new standard</a> for espresso beverages" in 2007. What's interesting is that year was actually the first time that Starbucks started carrying 2 percent.</p>
      <p>If you asked for it before then, what you really got was a blend of whole milk and skim milk made by the barista. According to the <b>Seattle Times</b>, "each reduced-fat latte at Starbucks was its own unique blend. Baristas poured a little from the whole-milk jug and a little from the skim-milk bottle until one-of-a-kind fat reduction was achieved."</p>
      <p>Now it seems crazy to think there used to be limited options for the type of milk you wanted to order in your latte. Today, <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/kids-drinks-and-other/milk">Starbucks's milks</a> include whole, nonfat, 2 percent, soy, coconut, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Starbucks-Almond-Milk-Taste-Test-42306598">almond milk</a>. Did you know that little piece of Starbucks history?</p>
