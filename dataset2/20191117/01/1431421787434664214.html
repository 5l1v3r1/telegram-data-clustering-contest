      <h1>Lebanon's Safadi Withdraws Candidacy for PM, Urges Hariri for Post</h1>
      <h2>Safadi, 75, emerged as a candidate on Thursday when political sources and Lebanese media said three major parties had agreed to support him for the position</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:30:38+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Former Lebanese finance minister Mohammad Safadi withdrew his candidacy to be the next prime minister on Saturday, saying that he saw that it would have been difficult to form a "harmonious" cabinet supported by all parties.</p>
      <p>Safadi, 75, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/amid-protests-lebanon-s-safadi-emerges-as-pm-choice-for-three-parties-1.8129809">emerged as a candidate</a> on Thursday when political sources and Lebanese media said three major parties had agreed to support him for the position.</p>
      <p>His decision to withdraw throws Lebanon's push to form a government needed to enact urgent reforms back to square one in the face of unprecedented protests that prompted prime minister Saad al-Hariri to resign last month.</p>
      <p>Safadi said in a statement that he had decided to withdraw following consultations with political parties and a meeting on Saturday with Hariri.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult to form a harmonious government supported by all political sides that could take the immediate salvation steps needed to halt the country's <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-lebanon-is-on-the-verge-of-a-deep-financial-crisis-here-s-how-it-got-there-1.8127673">economic and financial deterioration</a> and respond to the aspirations of people in the street," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Protesters who took to the streets on Saturday denounced Safadi's potential nomination, saying it ran counter to nationwide calls to oust a political elite they see him as part and parcel of.</p>
      <p>In the statement Safadi, a prominent businessman with ties to Saudi Arabia, thanked President Michel Aoun and Hariri for supporting his candidacy, and said he hoped Hariri would return as premier to form a new government.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-hezbollah-1.5598890">Shi'ite group Hezbollah</a> and its Shi'ite ally Amal had agreed to back Safadi following a meeting with Hariri late on Thursday, according to Lebanese media and political sources, but no political party had since formally endorsed his candidacy.</p>
      <p>The two Shi'ite groups, along with Aoun, a Maronite Christian, have sought for Hariri to return as premier but have demanded the inclusion of both technocrats and politicians in the new cabinet, while Hariri has insisted on a cabinet composed entirely of specialist ministers.</p>
      <p>The process for choosing a new premier requires Aoun to formally consult members of parliament on their choice for prime minister. He must designate whoever gets the most votes.</p>
      <p>Lebanon's prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, according to its <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/young-angry-lebanese-call-to-end-country-s-sectarian-based-regime-1.8019312">sectarian power-sharing system</a>.</p>
