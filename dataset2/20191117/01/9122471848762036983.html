      <h1>Iowa Football’s Tweet After Win vs. Minnesota Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:46:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Iowa Hawkeyes hosted one of the only remaining undefeated programs in college football.</p>
      <p>Despite entering with an undefeated record – and a win over then No. 4 Penn State – No. 8 Minnesota entered as an underdog. Saturday’s game between the Hawkeyes and Gophers shows why Las Vegas is king.</p>
      <p>Iowa was a three-point favorite over Minnesota and left with a 23-19 win – thanks to a missed extra point attempt.</p>
      <p>After the game, Iowa football’s official Twitter account decided to take a shot at the Minnesota football program. The Hawkeyes used Minnesota’s “Ski-U-Mah” chant against it.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>It’s a clever shot at the Gophers, one that Twitter was made for.</p>
      <p>With the win, Iowa moves to 7-3 on the season and finally has a big win over a ranked opponent this season. Every year, Kirk Ferentz’s team seems to knock off at least one top program at Kinnick Stadium.</p>
      <p>Minnesota, meanwhile, falls to 9-1 on the season, but still controls its own destiny in the Big Ten. If the Gophers win-out, they’ll likely face Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. A win there would likely have the Gophers in the College Football Playoff – but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
