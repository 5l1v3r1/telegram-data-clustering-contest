      <p>TORONTO -- In an emotional speech on the first “Coach’s Corner” since Don Cherry was fired, hockey broadcaster Ron MacLean said he still loves his former co-host but he ultimately had to choose “principle over friendship.”</p>
      <p>Maclean made his comments Saturday night during the first intermission of “Hockey Night in Canada” as the Toronto Maple Leafs took on the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
      <p>“We are all hurting. I have collapsed a hundred times if not more,” MacLean said. “I’ve sat all week long reflecting to you. I mean you, the viewers.”</p>
      <p>Sportsnet fired Cherry on Monday after a rant which many felt was critical of immigrants for not wearing Remembrance Day poppies.</p>
      <p>Maclean said he’d spoken to Cherry in the past week and called him a “fantastic human being,” telling his long-time co-host, “I love you so much.”</p>
      <p>In the wake of the controversy, Maclean apologized for giving a thumbs-up on-air reaction to Cherry’s comments. Cherry has not apologized.</p>
      <p>“How can you choose principle over friendship? But I had to,” Maclean said, adding that Cherry “made his choice, and I made mine.”</p>
      <p>At the start beginning of Saturday’s show, Maclean said there were “obviously mixed emotions” and called it “the end of an era.”</p>
      <p>Sportsnet has said it plans to take the long-running segment in a new direction.</p>
