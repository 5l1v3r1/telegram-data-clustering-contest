      <p>The Brexit Secretary has said he was “dismayed” by comments made about the UK by European Council president Donald Tusk.</p>
      <p>Stephen Barclay was referring to a speech during the week in which Mr Tusk appeared to back Boris Johnson’s opponents ahead of the General Election by advising campaigners not to give up on stopping Brexit.</p>
      <p>The outgoing president said the UK would become “an outsider, a second-rate player” after it left the EU, and said a friend who suggested it was “the real end of the British Empire” was probably right.</p>
      <p>Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Barclay said it was a “spirit of shared purpose” that enabled the UK to secure a deal, but he added: “I was dismayed, then, to see the comments of Donald Tusk – the outgoing President of the European Council – in his farewell speech on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <blockquote>He unequivocally revealed a desire to stop Brexit<cite>Stephen Barclay, on Donald Tusk</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“His disdain for Brexit is a badly kept secret. But at least no one can now be left in any doubt of his true motivations.</p>
      <p>“He unequivocally revealed a desire to stop Brexit.”</p>
      <p>Mr Tusk had said: “The UK election takes place in one month. Can things still be turned around? Hannah Arendt taught that things become irreversible only when people start to think so.</p>
      <p>“So the only words that come to my mind today are simply: Don’t give up. In this match, we had added time, we are already in extra time, perhaps it will even go to penalties?”</p>
      <p>Mr Barclay said the speech showed there was a “total disregard for democracy from some of those at the top of the EU machine”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Indeed it insults the intelligence of 17.4 million leave voters to say that they did not know what they were voting for.”</p>
