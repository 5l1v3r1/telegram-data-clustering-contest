      <h1>12 Kate McKinnon Impressions That Will Never Not Be Funny</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:20:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">Stacey Nguyen</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kate-mckinnon-funniest-snl-skits-46773985">Kate McKinnon</a> is the queen of comedy, and she's uncannily great at doing impressions on <b><a href="http://www.popsugar.com/Saturday-Night-Live">Saturday Night Live</a></b>. The seven-time Emmy nominee embraces her characters in a way that we can only describe as absolutely bonkers, always wearing fantastic makeup and showing an intrinsic knack for conveying her characters' quirks. Her impression of Hillary Clinton is a joy, infusing the forthright leader with a maniacal quality. We'd also be remiss not to give a shout-out to her other political impressions as well. The fact that she can pull off <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Saturday-Night-Live-Jeff-Sessions-Forrest-Gump-Skit-43265897">Jeff Sessions</a> <i>and</i> <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Kellyanne-Conway-Chicago-SNL-Skit-January-2017-43035746">Kellyanne Conway</a> speaks to her immense talent. From Elizabeth Warren to Justin Bieber, we've compiled McKinnon's best <b>SNL</b> impressions <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/snl-longest-cast-members-46783051">over the years</a>, so prepare yourself to be wowed by her incredible versatility.</p>
      <h3>1 Hillary Clinton</h3>

      <p>Ah yes, there's been two iconic impressions of Hillary Clinton on <b>Saturday Night Live </b>— <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Amy-Poehler">Amy Poehler</a>'s and McKinnon's. In a really rough election season in 2016, at least we could see the comedian bring a lighter touch to the seriousness of politics. McKinnon captured the former secretary of state's forthright demeanor and the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Op-Ed-Media-Sexism-2020-Presidential-Campaign-46067980">barrage of sexism</a> hurled towards her with a batty, goofy twist.</p>
      <h3>2 Elizabeth Warren</h3>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VNjZHZ7kpM0" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>With a gentle twang and explanatory hand gestures, McKinnon does a fantastic job as the Massachusetts senator on the 2020 campaign trail as she's engaging in some BDSM (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoRc298lahI"><b>SNL</b>'s words</a>, not mine) — bank destroying, and saving Medicare. Her best moment is when she fabulously transformed from Elizabeth Warren to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Sasha-Velour-RuPaul-Drag-Race-Interview-June-2018-44971634">Sasha Velour</a> during a skit about the CNN Equality Town Hall.</p>
      <h3>3 Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h3>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XhzSd-Kz-zA" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>

      <p>Felicity Jones is lovely as Ruth Bader Ginsburg in <b><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/On-the-Basis-of-Sex">On the Basis of Sex</a></b>, but if you're looking for the giggles, McKinnon will put you in stitches. She captures the headstrong, brazen spirit of the Supreme Court justice — to the extent of downing a huge packet of Emergen-C to show how RBG isn't retiring anytime soon.</p>
      <h3>4 Justin Bieber</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXvo6ksBHnI" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>McKinnon has portrayed Justin Bieber a few times, but her spoof of the singer's sultrily earnest Calvin Klein ad is by far one of her funniest bits on the show. She captures <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Sexy-Justin-Bieber-Pictures-45051253">JBieb's sexy allure</a> . . . then says things like "my peepee's in there" while pointing to her CK-covered crotch.</p>
      <h3>5 Kellyanne Conway</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sb9ybImGwkU" width="560" height="315" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>McKinnon's impression of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Kellyanne-Conway-Says-White-House-Doesnt-Talk-About-Hillary-44493516">Kellyanne Conway</a> is dead-on, gently poking fun at how Trump's counselor pivots by using ridiculous non-sequiturs and perfectly capturing her subdued demeanor. Her performance in "Conway," a riff on the musical <b>Chicago</b>, is too epic not to watch.</p>
      <h3>6 Ellen DeGeneres</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLXkVu-5Fsw" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You'll immediately recognize Ellen's slight Southern accent and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Guy-Viral-Post-Malone-Dance-Video-Ellen-Show-45929171">dance-it-out energy</a> in Kate McKinnon's very accurate portrayal of the talk show host. In this sketch, <b>SNL </b>also throws a few sharp zingers at the comedian's tendency to pivot to more lighthearted topics and love for corny jokes. We even see Vanessa Bayer and Nasim Pedrad as Sophia Grace and Rosie!</p>
      <h3>7 Jane Lynch</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZ-LANh4_Zg" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>McKinnon's take on <a href="http://www.popsugar.com/Jane-Lynch">Jane Lynch</a> is simply *chef's kiss*. Just like Lynch on <b>Hollywood Game Night</b>, she carries herself with swagger in a suit and hilariously exaggerates the actress's snappy gestures.</p>
      <h3>8 Jeff Sessions</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZM3jvlvgVw" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>McKinnon can really be a chameleon doing impressions of any gender, evidenced by her bonkers portrayal of the former attorney general. Hearing about <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Who-Jeff-Sessions-42730454">Jeff Sessions</a> in the vicious news cycle with regards Russia, immigration, and even <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Signs-Jeff-Sessions-Go-After-Legal-Weed-43312099">weed</a> can be hard, but McKinnon certainly brings levity with all of the weirdness in this character.</p>
      <h3>9 Betsy DeVos</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3l4NYspZLsU" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In addition to the perfect bob and the prim outfit with a statement necklace, McKinnon channels Betsy DeVos's cluelessly cool-as-a-cucumber and smiley demeanor by saying <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Betsy-DeVos-Uber-Lyft-Analogy-43377402">controversial</a> and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/news/Betsy-DeVoss-Comments-Historically-Black-Colleges-43245225">problematic</a> things about schools.</p>
      <h3>10 Martha Stewart</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBRCcxLbt0s" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Ana Gasteyer did an iconic impression as <a href="http://www.popsugar.com/Martha-Stewart">Martha Stewart</a>, but don't dismiss McKinnon's low-key horny take! In a faux ad for Match.com, McKinnon spoofs the lifestyle guru's wholesome image by saying that she's going on the dating app looking for someone to share her interests of "whimsical window eggs, tiered macaroons, and of course, the simple elegance of a good bang."</p>
      <h3>11 Angela Merkel</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MUGWmyvZxM" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In addition to the German accent and iconic bangs, McKinnon plays up the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Angela-Merkel">chancellor</a> as a dependable — but a little worn-out — leader that Europe treats like the mean mom who sends it straight to bed. She throws in some memorable, risqué gems in there like, "No Allies, it's mostly Axis these days."</p>
      <h3>12 Penélope Cruz</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJKEkZL9qrM" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Here, Sofia Vergara and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Penelope-Cruz">Penelope Cruz</a> (McKinnon) do a Pantene shampoo commercial, except Cruz is a little hard to understand when she starts dropping chemical names like "ammonium laureth sulfate." McKinnon channels <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Penelope-Cruz-Sexiest-Pictures-22795582">Cruz's sexy energy</a> and Spanish accent effortlessly.</p>
