      <h2>A Russian Su-27 recent intercepted an American F-15C.</h2>

      <p><b>Key point: </b>Russia and NATO's military buildup in the Baltics is creating a tense situation. </p>
      <p>In the most recent illustration of ongoing Russia-NATO military tensions over Baltic airspace, recently released <u><a href="https://theaviationist.com/2019/01/31/video-showing-russian-su-27-flanker-turning-into-a-u-s-air-force-f-15c-emerges/">footage</a></u> shows a Russian Su-27 fighter making a sharp turn into an American F-15C.</p>
      <p>It is unclear when the video was filmed, with some speculating that it occured during a prior NATO BAP (Baltic Air Policing) mission. When viewed in that light, this incident seems to fall into the trend of what US officials have previously described as “<u><a href="http://www.c6f.navy.mil/news/us-ep-3-intercepted-black-sea-nov-5-2018-updated-1638-cet">unsafe</a></u>” Russian interceptions and “aggressive maneuvers” in high-tension airspace.</p>
      <p>Russian tactical aircraft in the Baltic region have previously been accused of flying with their <u><a href="http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/5481/message-from-moscow-armed-russian-su-27s-violated-finnish-airspace-twice-in-one-day">transponders</a></u> off, which would certainly compound an already-tense interception. The Russians have levied similar accusations against western aircraft operating in the region; most recently, against an unidentified Swedish Gulfstream surveillance craft <u><a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/video-watch-russias-deadly-su-27-fighter-action-42767">intercepted</a></u> by an Su-27.</p>
      <p>But Russian media and military experts provide an entirely different context, arguing that it was the F-15 that engaged in “provocative” and “reckless” behavior by allegedly intruding on the flight path of a Russian government plane being escorted by the Su-27 in question.</p>
      <p>The Su-27’s pilot was just doing his job, military expert Andrei Krasnoperov told Russian state news outlet<u><a href="https://riafan.ru/1146583-u-nas-net-zheltorotikov-ekspert-ocenil-podgotovku-pilota-su-27-vytesnivshego-f-15-nato"> RIAFAN</a></u>: “Our government officials frequently fly, and are obviously going to be accompanied by our Su-27’s. Our fighters don’t intend to attack anyone, but they also cannot allow any encroachment on the flight path of the unarmed VIP plane. When the F-15 tries to fly close to such a plane, we don’t know what the NATO pilot is thinking-- he could occupy the VIP’s flight course, he can try to attack the plane, etc. To deter all of this, our pilots don’t allow [foreign aircraft] near planes that are being escorted. In the video, our Su-27 executed a pinning maneuver on its left axis to let the F-15 pilot know:<i> there is nothing to be gained here</i>. He was clearly warned: <i>turn back, or we’ll both go down</i>.”</p>
      <p>Krasnoperov went on to praise the professionalism of Su-27 interceptor pilots, further driving home the point that this interception was standard procedure, not a spur-of-the-moment decision by a hot-headed pilot: “... we don’t have rookies, and our pilot knows the plane’s capabilities. He knows how the Su-27 responds to various control commands, he knows much much to tilt, how much to thrust, and all the rest.”</p>
      <p>The Russian account is not implausible, given that Kremlin officials frequently fly to and from Kaliningrad-- a Russian enclave in Europe nestled between several NATO countries--  over Baltic airspace. For instance, a <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCROh09OPzY">similar altercation</a></u> between an Su-27 and F-16 occured in June 2017 while Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was en route to Kaliningrad onboard a Tu-154 airliner.</p>
      <p>Even so, there are currently no corroborating details to confirm or dismiss the Russian account. Interceptions are exceedingly common in the Baltic region, though some are more tense than others; as Krasnoperov points out, the Su-27 pilot was trained and apparently ready to attack the F-15C had it not promptly veered off course.</p>
      <p>Whatever the details may be, this incident reveals an unsettling truth about the ease with which the Russia-NATO military buildup in the Baltic can lead to direct military confrontation.</p>
