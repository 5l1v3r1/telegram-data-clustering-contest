      <p>The UFC Sao Paulo prelims are in the books and James Krause just earned himself a third round knockout on Sergio Moraes. Krause was composed throughout, and leaned on his straight strikes to pull out the late finish. Krause has now won four in a row to improve to 27-7 overall. Before that, Ricardo Ramos pulled out an impressive first-round submission of Luiz Eduardo Garagorri. Ramos took the back, and despite Garagorri standing to his feet, he was still able to lock up the rear-naked choke. Ramos is now 5-1 in the UFC as he made good on his move up to featherweight.</p>
      <p>Randy Brown pulled out a phenomenal finish of Warlley Alves in the second round. He first rocked his foe on the feet with a head kick, and then locked up a triangle. Brown has now won two-straight as he advances his career to 12-3. Earlier in the prelims, Douglas Silva de Andrade picked up a strong win over former bantamweight champ Renan Barao. He hurt Barao several times with heavy blows to make good on his return to featherweight and get himself back into the win column.</p>
