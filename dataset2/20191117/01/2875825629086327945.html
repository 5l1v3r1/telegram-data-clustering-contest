      <h1>Frank Lampard praised for resolving three major Chelsea concerns</h1>
      <h2>Jason McAteer believes the Blues' boss has answered the big questions that surrounded his side at the start of the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:04:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:04</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard has addressed the three major concerns surrounding his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> side at the start of the season, according to Jason McAteer.</p>
      <p>Lampard has exceeded expectations and received significant praise since leaving Derby County to take charge at Stamford Bridge under difficult circumstances over the summer.</p>
      <p>The Blues' boss lost star player Eden Hazard to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and was unable to sign players due to the transfer ban imposed on the club by FIFA.</p>
      <p>And although he has been hindered by the loss of big names over the summer and injuries to the likes of experienced defender Antonio Rudiger, Lampard's faith in young players such as Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham has been rewarded.</p>
      <p>Abraham has scored 10 times in 12 league games, while Mount and Tomori have also impressed - with all three players earning a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the current Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>

      <p>"What Brendan Rodgers is doing at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> is outstanding and the job Frank Lampard is doing at Chelsea is probably even more impressive," McAteer told the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/sport/saturday-columns/jason-mcateer-ireland-need-a-special-performance-to-see-off-clever-denmark/409323">Racing Post</a></p>
      <p>"I remember speaking to Frank when Chelsea and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> played the Super Cup in Istanbul and you could hear his concerns.</p>
      <p>"Where were the goals going to come from? Could Mason Mount do for Chelsea what he had done for Derby? Would he miss Antonio Rudiger?</p>
      <p>"But he and his players have answered all those questions and more."</p>

      <p>Chelsea's first game after the international break will see Lampard take his side to the Etihad Stadium to face defending champions <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>And although the Blues are currently third in the Premier League - one point above Pep Guardiola's side and only trailing Leicester on goal difference - McAteer still doesn't believe they can be considered true title contenders.</p>
      <p>"I’m a big fan of Frank and think Chelsea can continue to improve but they aren’t title contenders this season" he added.</p>
      <p>"Teams such as Chelsea and Leicester could easily go on a run of back-to-back losses, or picking up just a couple of draws in three matches, and that can lose you serious ground given the high standard set by Liverpool and City."</p>
