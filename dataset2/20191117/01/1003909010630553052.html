      <p>The familiar sound of bells ringing has returned as the annual Salvation Army Christmas kettle drive launched Saturday.</p>
      <p>As the holidays near, the charity is hoping to raise $1.1 million over the next six weeks to fund programs and services, like Christmas toy hampers, school supplies, shelter programs and more.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Karen Livick said the charity’s supports are needed now more than ever.</p>
      <p>“It’s a really uncertain time right now in Calgary, and families and parents are just not sure what’s going to happen,” said Livick. “I think it’s really important, especially at Christmas, that the Salvation Army can walk alongside them and provide something really basic like toys under their tree at Christmas to continue that hope.”</p>
      <p>She said the funds support seasonal and year-long programming by the <a href="http://www.salvationarmycalgary.org/">Salvation Army</a>, and as needs are projected to rise, it’s important these programs stay afloat.</p>
      <p>Last year, the charity didn’t meet its $1.1 million goal and instead raised just under $900,000. Fortunately, she said, there was no reduction in services thanks to donations outside of the festive season.</p>
      <p>This year marks the second fundraiser where tap-and-go options are available to passersby, who can donate using debit, credit or cash.</p>
      <p>One of the challenges of the yearly campaign is finding volunteers, said Livick, who added that they rely on hundreds of volunteers to offer their time to work the Christmas kettles.</p>
      <p>Without them, the campaign wouldn’t be possible, she said.</p>
      <p>The Salvation Army provides toys for about 8,000 children each holiday season.</p>
