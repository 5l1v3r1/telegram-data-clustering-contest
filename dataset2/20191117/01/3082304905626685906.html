        <b>Roger Federer has revealed the reason behind his ATP Finals semifinal defeat to Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets. The Greek tennis star got the better of Federer 6-3, 6-4 after the Swiss legend squandered as many as 11 break-points and made 26 unforced errors.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 38-year-old claimed that the break-points were only part of the reason behind his defeat as he ‘had some good spells’. He highlighted how he missed two smashes in a single game and got broken as well, all of which resulted in the loss altogether.</p>
      <p>“No doubt I had my chances. The break points were part of it. I had some good spells, but the spells where things were not working well, they were pretty bad.</p>
      <p>“Getting broken and missing two smashes in one game – that hasn’t happened in a long, long time or ever, so that was tough. At this level, you just can’t have it happen, so that was pretty disappointing,” Federer said after the defeat.</p>
      <p>When quizzed if he will return for the 2020 edition of the tournament, he said, “I’ve got to keep on playing at the level like I have this year and then I will create some chances. [I have] Got to take care of my body, listen to the signs, work well with the team and get the balance right with everything that’s happening in my life.”</p>
