      <h1>Stephen A. Smith Blasts Colin Kaepernick For How He Handled NFL Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:03:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith is not a fan of how Colin Kaepernick handled his workout with the NFL today. The <i>First Take </i>co-host posted his video reaction on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Smith called out Kaepernick and said he doesn’t believe the quarterback actually wants to play in the NFL.</p>
      <p>“He don’t want to play,” Smith said. “He wants to be a martyr.”</p>
      <p>Kaepernick was scheduled to work out at the Atlanta Falcons’ facility this afternoon. Reports suggested more than 24 teams were going to have scouts and executives in attendance.</p>
      <p>Instead, at the last minute, Kaepernick had the venue changed. The quarterback was reportedly unhappy with a waiver from the NFL and <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/nfl-statement-after-colin-kaepernick-changes-workout">wanted the media to be able to attend the event</a>.</p>
      <p>“All of us believe that Colin Kaepernick would have showed us,” Smith said. “I believe he would have had a job within two weeks. But he didn’t show…he wanted to show at a high school and YouTube it.</p>
      <p>You don’t want to work. You just want to make noise.”</p>

      <p>Kaepernick, meanwhile, said after his workout that he wants to play.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready. I’m staying ready. And I’ll continue to be ready. To all the people that came out today to support, I appreciate y’all, I love y’all. To the people that aren’t here, I’m thinking of you, I appreciate you supporting from where you are. We’ll continue to give you updates as we hear. We’ll be waiting to hear from Roger Goodell, the NFL, 32 teams. We’ll let you know if we hear from them.</p>
      <p>“The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go,” he said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Five or six teams were reportedly in attendance at the workout at the high school field, so it’s possible that one of those teams will be impressed enough to sign him.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
