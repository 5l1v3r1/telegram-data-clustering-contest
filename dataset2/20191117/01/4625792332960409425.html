      <h1>'New status': Pete Buttigieg runaway leader of premier Iowa poll</h1>

      <p>Pete Buttigieg leads the 2020 Democratic presidential field in Iowa, leapfrogging over Elizabeth Warren, according to a new poll.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg is the first choice for 25% of likely caucusgoers in the first-in-the-nation state compared to Warren's 16%, <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/11/17/pete-buttigieg-leads-new-iowa-poll-warren-sanders-biden-follow/4198100002/">a CNN/<i>Des Moines Register</i> survey</a> released late Saturday found. The research shows the mayor of South Bend, Indiana's popularity has shot up 16 percentage points since the poll was conducted in September.</p>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden is the top candidate for 15% of those surveyed, while another 15% of respondents said their No. 1 pick was Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>
      <p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar notched up 6% support, while Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, along with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, earned 3% apiece. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not officially declared his last-minute bid for the White House, attracted 2%. The other hopefuls gained 1% or less.</p>
      <p>Warren, the senior senator for Massachusetts, was in front of the primary pack when CNN and the <i>Des Moines Register</i> polled Iowa Democrats in September, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/warren-passes-biden-for-the-first-time-in-key-iowa-poll">slipping 6 percentage points from 22% since the beginning of fall</a>. The survey also records Biden's continual slide in public opinion since the summer, down another 5 percentage points over the same time period. In contrast, Sanders' approval jumped by 4 percentage points.</p>
      <p>“This is the first poll that shows Buttigieg as a stand-alone front-runner,” said J. Ann Selzer, whose firm produced the research. “There have been four candidates that have sort of jostled around in a pack together, but he has a sizable lead over the nearest contender — 9 points. So this is a new status for him.”</p>
      <p>The survey captures responses from 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers between Nov. 8 and Nov. 13. Its results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.</p>
