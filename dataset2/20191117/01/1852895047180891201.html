      <h1>Khloe Kardashian &amp; Daughter True Thompson, 1, Look Adorable As They Twin In Top Knot Buns</h1>

      <h4>Khloe and True looked SO cute as they hit up the Calabasas Farmers Market on Saturday afternoon!</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/khloe-kardashian/"><b>Khloe Kardashian</b></a>, 35, and <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/true-thompson/"><b>True Thompson</b></a>, 1 are GOALS! The adorable mommy-daughter combo were spotted twinning in top knot buns as they stepped out for an outing on Saturday, Nov. 16. True looked so adorable as she sported a pink velvet dress and matching sneaker while mom Khloe cradled her in her arms! Khloe kept her look more on the casual side in a black pair of leggings, Yeezy sneakers (designed by brother in law <b>Kanye West</b>), a white-and-black mock neck sweatshirt and <b>Kris Jenner</b>-approved black shades. True looked inquisitive as she glanced around — perhaps at the baked goods — as Khloe appeared to point something out to her little girl!</p>
      <p>The outing comes as Khloe’s ex and True’s dad <b>Tristan Thompson</b>, 28, appears to be trying to get back together. The NBA star has actively been leaving a slew of flirty comments on Khloe’s sexiest photos, recently gushing over her win as <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/10/peoples-choice-awards-winners-2019-who-won-pcas/">Choice Reality Star</a> at E’s <i>People’s Choice Awards</i> last weekend. “True and myself are so proud of you and the sisters for everything last night,” Tristan said after Khloe’s big win.</p>
      <p>He also recently sent Khloe a <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/09/khloe-kardashian-receives-balloons-tristan-thompson-fragrance-co-parenting-true-video/">massive balloon display</a>, featuring the letters “Pink Diamond” for her new fragrance collaboration with <b>Kim Kardashian</b>‘s KKW Fragrance line. The <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </i>star proudly showed off the gesture on Instagram, writing “Today was the launch of my pink diamond collection with KKW Fragrance and I got these balloons sent to me from baby True and Tristan and I really appreciate the love and the thoughtfulness,” she gushed, captioning an image of the pretty balloons. “I’m really proud at the co-parenting place that we are in.”</p>

      <p>Khloe and Tristan sadly called things quits after he admitted to inappropriately kissing <b>Kylie Jenner</b>‘s BFF <b>Jordyn Woods</b>, 22, at a party in February. Prior, Tristan was also caught on video cheating while Khloe was pregnant. Since the drama, Khloe has been committed to co-parenting but not interested in pursuing another <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/09/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-truth-about-getting-back-together-details/">go at a romantic relationship</a>.</p>
