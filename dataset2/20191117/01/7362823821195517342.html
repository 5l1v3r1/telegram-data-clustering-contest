      <h1>Trump undergoes tests at Walter Reed as part of annual physical, White House says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:16:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:16</time> by <a rel="author">Vandana Rambaran</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> spent more than two hours at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health">Walter Reed National Medical Center</a> on Saturday, undergoing what the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">White House</a> said were medical tests as part of his annual physical.</p>
      <p>The appointment -- which followed a previous exam in February -- didn't appear on the president's public schedule, as was the case for his physicals last year and this year. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News' <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/justice-jeanine">"Justice with Judge Jeanine"</a> on Saturday night that Trump had decided to "kind of get a headstart with some routine checkups."</p>

      <p>"We've got a really busy year ahead, as you can imagine," said Grisham, referring to the president's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/campaigning/trump-2020-campaign">2020 reelection campaign</a>. " ... It was very routine. We had a down day today and so he made the decision to head there."</p>
      <p>Grisham added that the president "is as healthy as can be ... He's got more energy than anybody in the White House. That man works from 6 a.m. until very, very late at night. He's doing just fine."</p>
      <p>The president later tweeted about his visit to Walter Reed, adding that he visited with the family of a patient who was undergoing major surgery.</p>
      <p>"Everthing very good (great!)," the president wrote. Will complete next year."</p>

      <p>In a statement earlier Saturday, Grisham said Trump, 73, had “a quick exam and labs” and assured that he remains in good health.</p>
      <p>“The President remains healthy and energetic without complaints, as demonstrated by his repeated vigorous rally performances in front of thousands of Americans several times a week,” she said.</p>

      <p>Results from Trump's last physical nine months ago revealed he had gained six pounds since taking office. At 243 pounds and 6 feet, 3 inches tall with a Body Mass Index rating of 30.4, the president passed the official threshold for being considered obese. Obesity, a common weight condition that affects 40 percent of Americans, can increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer.</p>
      <p>Trump doesn't drink alcohol or smoke but has a hearty appetite for fast food, steaks and desserts. His primary form of exercise is golf.</p>
