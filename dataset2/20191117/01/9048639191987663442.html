      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>Five Below, a popular store that sells products for five bucks or less, is undergoing a colossal change. It will start selling things above $5 for the first time in 17 years.</p>
      <p>The company said: "We've always done everything possible to absorb cost increases. Recently, we had to raise prices above five dollars on tech items to keep providing the products you love."</p>
      <p>The items costing up to $10 will be in separate sections of the stores.</p>
      <p>They will have a toys and games section called "Ten Below Gift Shop" and an electronics section called "Ten Below Tech."</p>
      <p>The company said most of its merchandise remains below $5, so itâ€™s keeping the store name.</p>
