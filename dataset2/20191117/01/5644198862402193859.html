      <p>INDORE: Skipper Virat Kohli on Saturday (No 16) praised "clinical" India after their pacemen helped crush Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs inside three days of the opening Test.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Shami claimed four wickets and returned match figures of 7-58 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 213 in the final session in Indore.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh's gamble to bat first after winning the toss backfired badly against the Indian pace attack who packed off the tourists for 150 on the opening day.</p>
      <p>Shami's fellow quicks Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma shared three wickets between them after India declared their first innings on 493 for six, with a lead of 343 runs.</p>
      <p>"Don't know what to say, another clinical performance," Kohli said after the win.</p>
      <p>"These guys (our pacemen) are on top of their game, when they bowl, it looks like any pitch is a good pitch.</p>
      <p>"Jasprit (Bumrah) isn't here but this is a dream combination for any captain. Having strong bowlers the most important thing in any team."</p>
      <p>Shami and Yadav shared 24 wickets between them in India's recent 3-0 Test sweep of South Africa.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur, who scored 43 in the first innings, finally became one of three wickets taken by off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin.</p>
      <p>Ashwin, who reached 250 wickets in home Tests in the first innings, got last man Ebadat Hossain for one to spark India's victory celebrations.</p>
      <p>India were dominant with the bat and ball against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Opening batsman Mayank Agarwal played a key part in the win with his 243 - his second double century in four Tests - as India amassed 407 runs on the second day.</p>
      <p>"Very professional with the bat, playing five batters with one guy taking responsibility is what we want with overseas tours coming up," said Kohli. "Hats off to the boys."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'BEST SEAM POSITION'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The bowlers kept up the pressure when Bangladesh started their second innings.</p>
      <p>Yadav drew first blood, taking Imrul Kayes for six on a ball that curved into the left-hander and rattled the leg stump.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma got Shadman Islam for six in the next over. Shami then trapped skipper Mominul Haque lbw for seven.</p>
      <p>Mominul was given not out by the on-field umpire but Kohli successfully reviewed the decision with replays showing the ball would have hit leg stump.</p>
      <p>Shami, who also took three wickets in the first innings, took Mohammad Mithun for 18.</p>
      <p>"Shami has always had the speed. I think he presents probably the best seam position in world cricket," India's bowling coach told reporters.</p>
      <p>"There is a perfect balance between fitness and the bowling he does. I think that works very well for Shami and that's the secret behind it."</p>
      <p>Bangladesh skipper Mominul said the batting of Mushfiqur and bowling of Abu Jayed had been the only "positives" in the disappointing defeat.</p>
      <p>Abu stood out with his four wickets in the Indian innings but got little support from his teammates.</p>
      <p>The second and final match is a day-night clash, with India hosting its first-ever pink-ball Test at Kolkata's Eden Gardens from Nov 22.</p>
