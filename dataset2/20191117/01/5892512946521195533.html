      <p>Welterweight veteran James Krause kept things rolling earlier tonight (Sat., Nov. 16, 2019) at UFC Fight Night 164 live on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania&amp;subId1=xid:fr1573879514136chh">ESPN+</a> from inside Ibirapuera Gymnasium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when he ended Brazilian submission specialist Sergio Moraes via third-round knockout (punches).</p>
      <p>After 14 minutes of stale action Krause was able to live up to his billing and cash in on his “Prelims” headliner. The veteran launched a crisp right hand that caught Moraes on the chin and crumbled him to the canvas. Krause landed a brief series of punches on the ground before the referee peeled him off and called a late end to the fight.</p>

      <p>With this performance, Krause has now won his last six Octagon appearances and follows up his TKO finish over Warlley Alves last year with another memorable knockout. The 33-year-old isn’t the most active fighter at 170 pounds, but he’s become one of the savviest veterans in the division. Maybe it’s time for UFC to give him a bigger name and put his impressive win streak to the test.</p>
