      <h1>Ohio State Joins Historic Company After Win vs. Rutgers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T01:52:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 01:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State failed to cover as a 53-point favorite in its win today. That is the only real negative you can find from today’s game, a 56-21 win over Rutgers in Piscataway.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes got out to an <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/ohio-state-is-off-to-a-ridiculous-start-vs-rutgers-today">incredibly fast start</a>, and basically cruised for most of the game. Starting quarterback Justin Fields and other key Ohio State players got plenty of rest today.</p>
      <p>They may not have won by 53+, but the 35-point margin was good enough to make some history. That margin makes it 10 straight 24+ point wins to start the season.</p>
      <p>The last, and only other team to do that in the last century? The 1971 Nebraska Huskers.</p>

      <p>That Huskers team started the year as the preseason No. 2 team in the country, jumped to No. 1 after Week 1, and never gave up that spot.</p>
      <p>The streak snapped in game No. 11 against rival Oklahoma, a tough-fought 35-31 win. They finished the year with a 45-3 win over Hawaii, and then smacked around No. 2 Alabama 38-6 in the Orange Bowl, completing one of the greatest seasons in college football history.</p>
      <p>Nebraska won by just under 32 points per game en route to the national title. Ohio State will have a tough road towards doing something similar, as LSU looks similarly great, and Clemson starts to round into form.</p>
      <p>Still, there’s no denying that Ryan Day’s first OSU team looks special so far.</p>
