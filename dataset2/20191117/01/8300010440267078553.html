      <p>SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A South Los Angeles family narrowly escaped injury after a dramatic fire erupted inside their apartment early Saturday morning.<br/><br/>Firefighters responded about 1 a.m. to the home in the 5300 block of South Main Street, where massive flames and black smoke were seen emanating from a second-story window.<br/><br/>News video showed a man and woman running out of the apartment, each of them carrying a young child in their arms.<br/><br/>Firefighters attacked the blaze from inside and on the roof, extinguishing it within 17 minutes, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. No serious injuries were reported.<br/><br/>"I'm just glad I got my kids out. That's the most important thing. All this is material stuff," resident David Gonzalez said, pointing to a pile of charred items outside the apartment. "Little by little we can get everything back. I'm glad that my kids - nothing happened to my kids."<br/><br/>The structure was deemed a total loss.<br/><br/>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
