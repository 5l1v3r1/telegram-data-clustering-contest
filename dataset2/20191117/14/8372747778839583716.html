      <p>Page Field saw a big crowd for Lee County Port Authority's annual Aviation Day on Saturday. People of all ages got the chance to talk to pilots and see World War II aircraft up close. The Warbirds were on full display so visitors can learn about the history and legacy of United States aviation.</p>
      <p>Dozens of vendors provided food, shopping, and free activities for attendees. While admission was free, people were asked to bring in donations for the Harry Chapin Food Bank as the organization gears up for the holiday season.</p>
