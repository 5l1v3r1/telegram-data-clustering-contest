      <p>While most dog beds have removable, washable covers, far fewer beds are entirely machine washable. And — because things like dirt, pet dander, and hair can seep inside the filling of a dog bed over time — investing in one of the <a href="https://www.k9ofmine.com/best-washable-dog-beds/">best washable dog beds</a> is the key to eliminating stains or lingering smells. These beds have inserts or fillings made of washable materials like polyester and cotton. (Though foam bedding is very soft, it typically breaks apart when washed, sadly.)</p>
      <p>Technically, finding these beds is as simple as searching for "machine washable" on a label or in a product description. However, look out for beds that advertise machine-washable covers, as you can't always toss the whole bed in the wash — and you'll likely have to hand wash or spot treat the insert to keep it clean.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that if your dog likes to prop their head up while they sleep, they would benefit from a bed that has side bumpers to keep their spine aligned. Meanwhile, a pet that snoozes curled up in a ball might be better off with a round, donut-shaped bed.</p>

It's made of a soft, suede-like exterior with a dig-resistant polyester filling. It's even designed with bumpers that provide head support and give your pup multiple options for sleeping positions. Plus, the bed's available in four sizes (from 24 inches to 52 inches in length) to accommodate dogs of most sizes.

      <p>When it's time to wash the bed, simply load it into the washer and set the cycle to "gentle." One Amazon reviewer wrote: "I have a Pug mix who is a slob, and I have to wash his bed every two weeks. Every other bed I ever bought him disintegrated after a couple of months ... After owning this for two years, when I wash it, it's still like brand new."</p>

Plus, the round donut shape is perfect for dogs who like to curl up in a ball or sleep with their head or legs hanging off the bed. "I have washed [this bed] multiple times and it holds up well. [It's] so much easier to throw the whole bed into the washer and dryer than to struggle with zippered covers and foam insets," reads a rave Amazon review.</p>

It's made of organic cotton and a faux sherpa material (meaning there's no off-putting chemical smell right out of the box) and is designed with plush bolsters for dogs who like to cuddle up against something. The rectangle shape also makes it the perfect for fitting inside a crate. For the best results, the manufacturer recommends washing this bed on a "gentle" setting.</p>
      <p>Amazon reviewers love this dog bed, "This bed stole my dog from me. I once had a sweet, lovable Basset Hound pup who would fall asleep in my lap, long ears askew. And then the bed came, and she forgot all about mommy's lap. Also, like any obsessed dog owner, she sleeps in bed with us (you know, a human bed)... Also, I've washed it several times and it has held up well. I tumble dry with no heat and it retains its shape perfectly."</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you have some old clothes, blankets, or towels lying around, meet an affordable, DIY solution: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQTR11Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00CQTR11Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bustle-13223462-20&amp;linkId=a7f28f6b90253b4d6523f4f80ff8cc08">Molly Mutt dog bed duvet cover</a>. Just stuff it with the soft textiles you already own, and you're good to go. The cover is fully washable and made of pre-shrunk, 100 percent cotton. It's available in sizes ranging from small to large, and there are more than 18 different colors and styles to choose from. Best of all, using items like old T-shirts to fill it makes the bed smell like your dog's favorite human, aka you.</p>
      <p>One fan on Amazon raves, "This cover works very well. We got this and the stuff bag. We put pillows inside the stuff bag and our dog loves her new bed. This cover washed very well in our washing machine. It is wonderful to have finally found a decent sized dog bed that we can wash entirely in our washing machine. However, the cover does seem to attract all the dog hair that our dog sheds, so it needs to be cleaned frequently."</p>
