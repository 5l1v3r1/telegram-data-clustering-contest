      <h1>Flying Lotus Trolls Adult Swim Festival Crowd With DOOM Impostor Played By Hannibal Buress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:02:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/JustinI" target="_blank">Justin Ivey</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles, CA – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50782/title.doom-admits-he-doesnt-listen-to-hip-hop-only-raps-to-get-money">DOOM</a> impostors aren’t a <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.10799/title.promoter-says-doom-impostors-are-intentional">new phenomenon</a>, but they’re usually not portrayed by someone who’s arguably more famous than the man himself.</p>
      <p>That’s what happened though when comedian <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.36381/title.listen-to-hannibal-buress-vic-mensa-discuss-internet-dating-on-the-handsome-rambler-podcast">Hannibal Buress</a> donned the mask to portray the enigmatic rapper during <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51911/title.flying-lotus-laughed-like-a-goat-when-he-saw-tierra-whacks-response-to-his-album-request">Flying Lotus</a> a.k.a. Captain Murphy’s set at the 2019 <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.3152/title.jason-demarco-reveals-how-adult-swims-1st-festival-came-to-be">Adult Swim Festival</a> on Friday (November 15).</p>
      <p>Lotus teased the crowd by claiming he brought DOOM “all the way from London” to the event in Los Angeles. Madvillain’s “Accordion” began to play and Buress — wearing DOOM’s signature mask — emerged on stage to lip-sync the performance.</p>
      <p>The ruse didn’t last long as Lotus unmasked his friend to reveal the truth. The <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.2359/title.flying-lotus-youre-dead">acclaimed</a> producer then asked, “Hannibal, what are you doing here?”</p>
      <p>Buress replied, “I wanted to help out. DOOM doesn’t do shows like that, man.”</p>

      <p>DOOM has longstanding ties to Adult Swim, but the relationship between the two sides went sour in 2017.</p>
      <p>The veteran MC and network teamed up that year for a series titled <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44296/title.adult-swim-is-dropping-15-new-doom-tracks-for-the-missing-notebook-rhymes-series"><i>The Missing Notebook Rhymes</i></a>, which was supposed to result in the release of 15 new DOOM tracks. But only seven weeks into the rollout, Adult Swim abruptly <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44757/title.dooms-the-missing-notebook-rhymes-series-comes-to-abrupt-end">cut it short</a> and removed all the songs from its site.</p>
      <p>“Adult Swim is ending our relationship with DOOM, and thus, the remaining <i>Missing Notebook Rhymes </i>will unfortunately have to remain…missing,” the network said in a statement. “We are glad to have had the chance to provide the previous free tracks to our fans.”</p>
