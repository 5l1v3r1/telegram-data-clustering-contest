      <p><b>ARKADELPHIA, Ark. (AP) —</b> Two Arkansas college chemistry professors have been arrested on charges of making meth, in an apparent case of life imitating art.</p>
      <p>The Clark County sheriff’s office said Henderson State University professors Terry David Bateman and Bradley Allen Rowland were arrested Friday on charges of manufacturing methamphetamine and using drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t clear if they remained in jail Sunday, and a jail official said he couldn’t give out that information.</p>
      <p>Tina Hall, a spokeswoman for the Arkadelphia-based school, said Bateman and Rowland have been on administrative leave since Oct. 11. She said three days earlier, police investigated a report of a chemical odor in the campus science center. She said the building reopened Oct. 29 after a company filtered the air.</p>
      <p>The arrests drew comparisons to the central character in the hit TV series “Breaking Bad,” in which a high school chemistry teacher began making methamphetamine.</p>
