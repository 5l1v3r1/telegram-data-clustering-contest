      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cathlynjones/">Cathlyn Jones</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michaelcdavis3/">Michael Davis</a> ended up sitting next to eachother on a Southwest airline flight.</p>
      <p>The airline has unassigned seating and Cathlyn thought Michael was cute so she sat down in his row.</p>
      <p>By the end of the flight, they had swapped numbers and a week later, they went on a date.</p>
      <p>So when Michael decided to propose, he wanted to incorporate a plane into the special moment.</p>
      <p>He found the Frontiers of Flight Museum in Dallas, Texas, where they have the first Southwest plane on display.</p>
      <p>He got her family involved and made Cathlyn think she was filming a commercial for a girls’ trip to Dallas, with them even sending her a fake itinerary.</p>
      <p>But really, Michael had planned to get down on one knee, with photographer Randi Michelle on standby to capture the moment.</p>

      <p>As a professional baseball player, the couple is apart for seven months of the year and she wasn’t expecting him to be there.</p>

      <p>She boarded the plane to find him waiting on one knee, as their families stood outside and waved through the windows.</p>
      <p>They said it was the best day of their lives so far (there is still the wedding day after all!)</p>

      <p>She said: ‘They sent us a bottle of champagne with our names, engagement date, and the flight number we met on engraved on the bottle.</p>
      <p>‘Southwest has always been my favorite airline to fly on, but I love them even more now after meeting my future husband on it.’</p>
