      <p>When it comes to your getting-ready routine, applying eye makeup is the fun part. And though perhaps a less enjoyable task,<i> removing </i>said eye makeup is crucial. However, as anyone with sensitive eyes knows, using the wrong eye makeup remover can easily leave you burning, itching, stinging, or even swollen. To help narrow down the <a href="https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-eye-makeup-removers-ophthalmologist-recommendations">best eye makeup removers for sensitive eyes</a>, Bustle spoke with Nashville-based ophthalmologist and aesthetic surgeon <a href="https://www.toyosclinic.com/about-us/meet-our-staff/melissa-toyos-md">Dr. Melissa Toyos</a>, who shares her tips on what to look for in a formula (and how to properly remove your eye makeup without causing irritation) below.</p>
      <p>"Eyes are naturally more sensitive than other body parts because the skin is thinner and more delicate there than anywhere else on the body," Dr. Toyos explains of why you may experience eye irritation so easily. "Dry eyes, allergies, and even pollution can make them more sensitive," she notes. To keep irritation to a minimum, you'll obviously want a makeup remover that was specially designed for the more sensitive skin around the eyes. But more specifically, Dr. Toyos says to avoid harsh cleansing ingredients, like detergents and sodium laureth sulfate. It's also helpful to look for products that say they've been tested by ophthalmologists and are fragrance-free and hypoallergenic.</p>
      <p>As for<i> how</i> to remove your eye makeup, Dr. Toyos says to be cautious of how harshly you're applying the remover. "Use a gentle rub," she says. "Forceful rubbing can stretch the skin, and it releases more histamines which worsens the cycle of allergies." If you've overdone it while trying to remove stubborn makeup, or allergies are the main culprit of your sensitivity, Dr. Toyos says that eye drops will help you out. "I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BVYZL88/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19220694-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07BVYZL88&amp;linkId=c2c00dab8745189ff232151786081c95">LUMIFY</a> to reduce redness," she says.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"I prefer oil-based removers, but only natural oils like coconut, or my favorite, cold-pressed castor oil," Dr. Toyos notes of her go-to eye makeup remover. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7TBG6J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19220694-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01N7TBG6J&amp;linkId=012667eef3e5e55fde60214c51c8c5ec">Kate Blanc Cosmetics castor oil</a> is a solid option because it's cold-pressed from castor beans and USDA certified-organic, ensuring that it doesn't contain harmful chemicals or questionable additives. The multitasking product can also be used to moisturize your skin and hair, and many Amazon reviewers use it to condition their brows and lashes, too. Whether used as an eye makeup remover or to promote healthier lashes, reviewers confirm it's a gentle choice. "I have very sensitive eyes that swell easily, [and] this product did not cause any irritation or swelling," commented one Amazon shopper.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Micellar water-devotees will be glad to know that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZLAWM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19220694-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B002XZLAWM&amp;linkId=1e6ef3d98af94bbb45e65ba6ec352c42">Bioderma's cult-favorite Sensibio H2O cleansing water</a> was formulated specifically with sensitive skin in mind (and it's super gentle on eyes, too). This remover doesn't dry out skin because the fatty acid esters that form the makeup- (and dirt- and oil)-removing micelles are similar to the phospholipids that naturally fortify the skin. Because it has the consistency of water, it's best used with cotton pads. And this bottle is big, so you can plan on it lasting you a while. You can even use it to cleanse your entire face, and it leaves skin feeling soft instead of stripped.</p>
