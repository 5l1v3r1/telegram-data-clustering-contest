      <h1>Selena Gomez Is the Queen of Breakup Songs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:24:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Feller</a></address>
      <p>Selena Gomez is finally putting out new music again, and the theme of her work is clear: She's been through a breakup, and she wants to sing about it. The pop star released the certified bops <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29553902/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/">"Lose You to Love Me"</a> and <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29572428/selena-gomez-look-at-her-now-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/">"Look at Her Now"</a> back-to-back this October, and after one look at the lyrics, it's painfully obvious who she's writing about. (Hint: It rhymes with Shmustin Shmieber.)</p>
      <p>You have to respect the blatant shade—putting out a song about your ex within a month of <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29309587/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-wedding-instagram/">his wedding</a> is a power move!—but more importantly, you can't deny that Gomez knows how to write a break up track.</p>
      <p>Have you just been through a split of your own? Are you angry, wistful, vengeful? No matter your feels, Gomez has a song for you. Below, we've compiled the definitive Selena Gomez breakup soundtrack.</p>
      <h3>"Forget Forever" (2013)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>The first entry in the J. Biebs breakup canon, "Forget Forever" is another way of saying to your ex, "Hi, you're an idiot. Please never call me again."</p>
      <p><b>The best line:</b> "Our love was made to rule the world / You came and broke the perfect girl"</p>
      <h3>“The Heart Wants What I Want” (2014)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>Almost more famous than the song itself is the first minute of its <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/news/a15173/selena-gomez-heart-video/">music video</a>, where Gomez speaks from the heart, talking about how her ex hurt her and made her feel crazy, all while on the brink of tears. It’s a rare and intimate peek into her side of the break up.</p>
      <p><b>The best line: </b>“Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear / You might be right, but I don't care / There's a million reasons why I should give you up / But the heart wants what it wants”</p>
      <h3>“Same Old Love” (2015)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>Gomez's bop from 2015 is still a perfect tune for when you’ve decided you are o-v-e-r it. Delete the texts, rip up the photos, blast this song, and say bye to your ex.</p>
      <p><b>The best line: </b>“I don't believe, I don't believe it / You left in peace, left me in pieces / Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees”</p>
      <h3>“It Ain’t Me” (2017)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>Saying goodbye to a partner means you don’t have to be the one cleaning up their messes anymore. So when they try to text you, acting like you’re still their support system, just send them a link to this song.</p>
      <p><b>The best line: </b>“Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone? / Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? / It ain't me”</p>
      <h3>“Back to You” (2018)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>Of course it’s nice if you can break up with someone, wipe your hands of the relationship, and move on. But also el-oh-el—when does that ever happen? “Back to You” puts words to the feelings we’ve all had about the One Who Got Away. In short, we’d take them back in a heartbeat if we could.</p>
      <p><b>The best line: </b>“Took you like a shot / Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening / Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you”</p>
      <h3>“Lose You to Love Me” (2019)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>Mere weeks after Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber had a very public wedding, Gomez drops this bombshell of a song, basically calling out Justin’s antics and how their breakup led her to finally loving herself.</p>
      <p><b>The best line: </b>“I gave my all and they all know it / Then you tore me down and now it's showing / In two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it / In the thick of healing”</p>
      <h3>“Look at Her Now” (2019)</h3>
      <p><b>The song: </b>We love a redemption track. The day after releasing her emotional “Lose You to Love Me,” she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3_Kc46Cl_T/">released this single</a> as a “special gift to all of my ride or dies.” The whole song and video has a general “I’m so better off without you” vibe that really lets Gomez shine.</p>
      <p><b>The best line: </b>“Of course she was sad / But now she's glad she dodged a bullet / Took a few years to soak up the tears / But look at her now”</p>
