      <p>Later, back at the village Jacob tries to speak to Leanna and after a passionate kiss, they end up sleeping together.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Jacob begins to act distant and quickly leaves, leaving Leanna upset and in need of someone to talk to.</p>
      <p>She later decides to tell her dad's fiancée Bernice about sleeping with Jacob, but the beautician is left conflicted when Leanna asks her not to tell her dad Liam.</p>
      <p>However when Leanna throws up in front of Liam as a result of taking the morning after pill, Bernice is forced to come clean and tell her soon-to-be husband about Leanna and Jacob.</p>

      <p>Before long, Liam is barging into the shop and accusing Jacob of forcing his daughter into sleeping with him and brands him a rapist in public.</p>
      <p>Things soon turn violent when the doctor punches the teenager and later everyone is in shock when Liam is arrested under suspicion on assault.</p>
      <p>It's yet another in a long line of shocks for the teenager, but it won't end there...</p>
      <p>With Leanna throwing up the morning after pill up, could she be pregnant?</p>
      <p>And with Maya now back out in the world, will she return for Jacob just like she promised?</p>
