      <h1>ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit Reacts To Oklahoma’s Crazy Win vs. Baylor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:24:25+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit was on the call for Oklahoma’s big comeback win at Baylor on Saturday night. The Sooners rallied from a 21-point halftime deficit to get a massive road win over the Bears in Waco.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts played poorly early, but came on strong in the second half, leading Lincoln Riley’s offense on several big touchdown drives late.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma took the lead on a field goal and picked off a Baylor pass to seal the victory late.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit took to Twitter shortly after the game ended.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to Oklahoma on an unbelievable comeback win tonight at Baylor. Down 31-10 at halftime-&amp; they fight back to tie it at 31 and hit a late FG and get a pick to seal it. Total team effort led by the poise &amp; playmaking ability of Jalen Hurts. What a game!” he wrote.</p>

      <p>What a game, indeed.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma stays in the College Football Playoff race as a result of the win. Baylor probably does, too, though the Bears were already ranked quite low despite being undefeated.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will come out on Tuesday night.</p>
