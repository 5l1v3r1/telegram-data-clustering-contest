            <b>QAL Vs MAR Dream11 Team, Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: A win assures Qalandars of qualification into the semi-finals from Group B.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Sitting atop of Group B ahead of making an advent into the dramatic land of their culminating encounter of the group stages, Qalandars will be looking to affirm themselves of qualification into the ensuing round come today. Not only will a win take them into the semi-finals but also assure them of a place in the pinnacles of the group, a set of events which are set to see the side come hot out of the blocks for this one.</p>
          <p>After drawing their league opener, the side ended up putting in a resounding result in their previous outing in the league as they ripped into Northern Warriors to cut short their work. In what was an as comprehensive as they come performance, the side outshone their opponents in all the departments of the game to register the biggest win of the league till now on that day.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>Batting first to score 112, it was the Qalandars’ bowling unit which really won the day as they ended up cutting short their opponent’s run chase at a mere 46. The 66 run win not only gave them important points but massively propelled their net run-rate, making it untouchable for the rest of ther counters.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, their opponents of the day were not quite so fortunate with the team’s dependent batting unit being disparaged in their league opener. The side registered a mere 88 runs, a score which was never going to be enough and the writing was always on the wall in their defence as the side were defeated by 9 wickets with Northern Warriors chasing down the target in just  overs.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>The pitches in this league have maintained their identity despite the heavy brunt of cricket given the short format of the matches. It’s something which has ensured that these are pristine batting tracks with the ball lying onto the bat extremely sweetly to crunch the ball in the middle.</p>
                      <p>The side winning the toss is all set to come out and chase today with the format and pitch being conducive for the same.</p>

                            <h3>QAL Vs MAR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Chadwick Walton’s 24 runs in the 17 balls the last time around saw him square his arms and cream the ball to the fence on five occasions to see the wicket-keeper from Maratha Arabians become an instant pick for us for this prevelant encounter.</p>
                            <p>From Qalandars meanwhile we are bringing in Luke Ronchi with the opener always being someone to opt for given the vast strokeplay he comes imbued with at his disposal which makes him someone we just can’t neglect.</p>
                            <h3>QAL Vs MAR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>When you end up scoring 53 r uns in a mere 28 balls, you have to become someone to invest in. Tom Banton was in enterprising touch in the side’s last affair, scoring a behemoth of a knock as he cantered his and his side’s way to a gargantuan score to see us earmark the player for this encounter as well.</p>
                            <p>He will find company in the form of Dawid Malan with the bat being in imperious and succulent touch for England against New Zealand while Philip Salt will come in as well for us to wrap up our trio of picks from the side. From the opposing end we are choosing Chris Lynn to wrap up our batting order for the day.</p>
                            <h3>QAL Vs MAR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>With 37 runs and the two wickets in the previous match, Seekuge Prasanna ended up playing a solid role in the Qalandars’ win on the day to make the all-rounder an instant pick given the elevated role he commands in both the sections of his side’s gameplan. George Garton meanwhile returned with figures of 3-10 to see us go in with him as well from the unit to make this facet all about the picks from one side.</p>
                            <h3>QAL Vs MAR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Lahiru Kumara also got 3-10 in the side’s last match to play a major role in his team bundling out their opponents for just 46 to make him the lone pick from Qalandars from the day. From the other side meanwhile we have selected Mitchell McCleneghan and Wanindu Hasaranga, two players capable of striking at regular intervals and inducing false shots in batsmen.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Dawid has been made our captain for this one while Banton will represent us as our vice-captain.</p>
