      <p>Harry Styles isn't in a boy band anymore, you know. He's in a man band now.</p>
      <p>Styles hosted <i>Saturday Night Live</i> for the first time in the latest episode, and he used his inaugural opening monologue to talk up his One Direction roots and tease a reunion that never happens. At one point, he suggests Simon Cowell grew them all in test tubes.</p>
      <p>The first-time <i>SNL</i> host also gently roasted former One Direction bandmate Zayn Malik, who left the group a year before they went on hiatus in 2016. Styles rattles off the names of his other former One Direction pals before pausing and capping it off with "Ringo."</p>
      <p>The joke would've landed better if he'd said "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Best">Pete Best</a>," <i>just saying</i>.</p>
