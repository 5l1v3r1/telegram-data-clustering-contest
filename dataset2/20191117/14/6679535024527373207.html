      <h2>This was the 14th edition of festivities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:22:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-MYSURU-119974/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent MYSURU</a></address>
      <p>Hundreds of people witnessed the annual abhisheka for the Nandi statue at Chamundi Hill on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Organised by the members of the Bettada Balaga Charitable Trust, this was the 14th edition of the event and brought the granite statue alive in different hues.</p>
      <p>As priests chanted sacred hymns and offered special prayers, various ingredients, including milk, curds, sugarcane juice etc., mixed with vermilion, turmeric and water was poured from a special platform constructed for the purpose.</p>
      <p>The 350-year-old statue turned white as it was bathed in milk and then turned yellow and red, as the abhisheka continued and water with coloured ingredients cascaded from head to toe.</p>
      <p>A battery of 10 priests presided over the proceedings and conducted the special rituals followed by mangalarthi.</p>
      <p>The statue was restored by the State Archaeological Department last year and the accumulated grime was removed.</p>
      <p>Members of the Bettada Balaga Trust, senior seers of Adi Chunchanagiri Mutt, Hosa Mutt were among those present.</p>
