      <h1>The Idina Menzel And AURORA Frozen 2 Collaboration On Into The Unknown Is The New Let It Go And Brings Changes For Norweigian Singer</h1>

      <p>The <i>Frozen 2</i> <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/the-frozen-2-soundtrack-is-only-thirty-one-minutes-long-and-your-kids-are-going-to-make-you-listen-to-every-second-of-it-341679/">soundtrack</a> is here and the upcoming movie has its answer to <i>Frozen’s</i> hit song “Let It Go.” The sequel brings back the same team that led <i>Frozen</i> to great success and husband and wife songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are back at the helm, undoubtedly creating more Oscar-worthy songs — such as the powerhouse ballad “Into The Unknown.”</p>
      <p>A collaboration between Idina Menzel and Norwegian singer AURORA, “Into The Unknown” brings AURORA to the attention of Disney fans and many hope that this will be the beginning of more work between the singer and the company.</p>
      <p>The premise of <i>Frozen 2 </i>is that Elsa is being wooed by dark magic where she might turn against everyone and everything she loves in the quest of power.  “Into The Unkown” is almost a call and response song as  AURORA voices the secret siren who is calling to Elsa.</p>
      <p>“Into The Unknown” begins with AURORA’s haunting and ethereal vocals calling repeatedly to Idina with a series of  “oohs and ahhs” while Idina sings her response as Elsa to the melodic and hypnotic lure of her call.</p>
      <p>The beginning of the song’s lyrics and chorus are as follows.</p>
      <p>“I can hear you but I won’t<br/>Some look for trouble while others don’t<br/>There’s a thousand reasons I should go about my day<br/>And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh<br/>Whoa<br/>You’re not a voice, you’re just a ringing in my ear<br/>And if I heard you, which I don’t, I’m spoken for I fear<br/>Everyone I’ve ever loved is here within these walls<br/>I’m sorry, secret siren, but I’m blocking out your calls<br/>I’ve had my adventure, I don’t need something new<br/>I’m afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you<br/>Into the unknown<br/>Into the unknown<br/>Into the unknown”</p>
      <p>You may see a snippet of the animated movie that hits theaters on November 22, 2019, in the video player below.</p>

      <p>Though Idina could have sung this song and expressed Elsa’s struggle to fight against the temptation the siren is essentially tormenting her with, the decision to voice the siren was brilliant.</p>
      <p>The choice to use AURORA to bring the voice of the siren to life makes this song a journey that kids, teens, and even adults are going to want to take and all but secures “Into The Unknown’s” spot at the Oscars and the Grammys.</p>
      <p>You may listen to Idina Menzel and AURORA perform “Into The Unknown” from <i>Frozen 2</i> in the video below.</p>

      <p>AURORA’s collaboration with Idina Menzel and her entering the world of Disney will most likely be career-changing for the Norweigian 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>Still relatively unknown to many U.S. audiences, that is about to change once the movie is released, and not only will people discover her amazing talent, but she is part of the Disney family now.</p>
      <p>What do you think of Aurora’s vocals on her collaboration with Idina Menzel? Do you hope Disney finds more ways to include AURORA in their films? Are you going to see Frozen 2 when it hits theaters?</p>
