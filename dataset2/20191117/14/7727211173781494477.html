      <p>A <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/bosses-fixers-heavies-dealers-inside-17257787">Liverpool</a> man has admitted a drugs charge after he was caught trying to smuggle around 10kg of heroin into Jersey.</p>
      <p>Alexander Daniel Cullen, 29, was arrested after customs officers found a massive haul of suspected <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/superhuman-strength-heroin-addict-threatened-17266195">drugs</a> in the fuel tank of his car as he arrived in Jersey on board the Condor Liberation from Poole.</p>
      <p>It later emerged that officers had found 10kg of heroin with a street value of around £10m, the largest ever haul in the island's history.</p>
      <p>On November 8 Cullen appeared in court wearing a black Gucci t-shirt, blue jeans and black bomber jacket Cullen pleaded guilty to a single charge of importing a controlled drug.</p>

      <p>The initial seizure took place on September 7 at Jersey Harbour. Cullen, who is originally from Liverpool, is due to be sentenced before the Royal Court’s Superior Number – which only convenes for the most serious offences.</p>
      <p>He was represented by Advocate Sarah Dale, who made no application for bail. Lieutenant-Bailiff Anthony Olsen was presiding. Jurats Jerry Ramsden and Kim Averty were also sitting.</p>
      <p>The seizure outstrips the £1m cannabis haul <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/how-curtis-warren-taught-liverpool-15552429">Curtis Warren</a> was linked to in 2009. The Toxteth man was jailed for 13 years for his role in the conspiracy to import 400 pounds of the drug into Jersey.</p>
      <p>Warren always denied his involvement in the plot. He has remained behind bars after refusing to pay a confiscation order worth £198m.</p>
      <p>Cullen will be sentenced on December 17.</p>
