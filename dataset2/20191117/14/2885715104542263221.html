      <p>A 16-year-old boy tied up his cousin to bed and allegedly raped her in Gurgaon, area, police said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on Thursday but was reported to the police on Friday, after the 15-year-old girl fainted in school and narrated it to her teacher.</p>
      <p>The girl’s mother has filed a complaint at the Woman’s Police Station against the son of her sister-in-law, said Subhash Bokan, Public Relations Officer of Gurgaon Police.</p>
      <p>The woman had sent her daughter to her sister-in-law’s home to help her with daily chores as she was not keeping well.</p>
