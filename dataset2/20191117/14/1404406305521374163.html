      <p>According to reports, Tay-K has been indicted on a capital murder charge after being accused of shooting and killing man during a robbery that took place in April 2017.</p>
      <p>Previously, <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/256662/tay-k-sentenced-to-55-years-in-prison-for-role-in-2016-home-invasion-murder">Tay-K was convicted for another murder charge that got him 55 years in prison</a>. Now, the rapper has to face what allegedly went down with the incident that occurred in a Chick-Fil-A parking lot. Tay-K allegedly robbed a man named Mark Anthony Saldivar for his camera equipment and killed the man after he hopped on the hood of the rapper’s car to stop Tay-K and other associates from getting away.</p>
      <p>As a result of this incident, Tay-K fled and was wanted in a national manhunt. During that, he released the track “The Race,” and the video featured him posing with his wanted poster. Stay tuned for more details in the case. </p>
