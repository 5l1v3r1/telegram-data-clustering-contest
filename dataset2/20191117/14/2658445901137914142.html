      <p>The Lagos State Chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has kicked against the directive of the Comptroller of Customs, to suspend supply of petroleum products to fuel stations within 20 kilometres to Nigeria’s borders.</p>
      <p>State Chairman of IPMAN, Mr. Akin Akinrinade, and the secretary, Mr. Akeem Balogun, described the decision as punitive and uncalled for, because the fuel stations are not serving people outside the borders.</p>
      <p>It asked for the immediate reversal of the order to avoid undue punishment of Nigerians living in border communities, the fuel stations owners and the staff working at these stations.</p>
      <p>“Our position at IPMAN is that we are not and cannot support any act of smuggling of any petroleum products. Our members are entitled to decent living which cannot be taken away from them,” IPMAN said.</p>
