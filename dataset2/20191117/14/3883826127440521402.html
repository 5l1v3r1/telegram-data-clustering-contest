        <b>Everyone will be entitled to a "free teeth MOT" in England under a Labour government, the party says.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Labour is proposing to scrap band one dentistry charges, which cover a check up, a scale and polish, and any X-rays that may be needed.</p>
      <p>It believes patients are put off going because of the fee - a check up costs £22.70 - with many ending up in A&amp;E.</p>
      <p>Dental leaders welcomed the move, but said there was a shortage of dentists that needed addressing too.</p>
      <p>Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said charges were a real barrier to access services for some.</p>
      <p>"With 135,000 patients presenting at A&amp;E with dental problems every year, it's time we put prevention at the heart of our approach to health."</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn added: "This is the first step towards making all dentistry services free of charge."</p>
      <p>He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that free dental checks would "save money in the long-run" and it was "actually an investment for the future".</p>
      <p>"If we don't have a dental check and then somewhere down the line we have a catastrophe, a disaster, massive pain, we have to go to A&amp;E and that is then very expensive," he said.</p>
      <p>Labour said the policy would cost £450m a year.</p>
      <p>Health is devolved so the policy only covers England. Wales and Northern Ireland both charge for check ups, but Scotland does not.</p>

      <h3>How do the charges work?</h3>

      <p>There are three fee bands for treatment. They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Band one (£22,70) - check up, scale and polish and any X-rays</li>
        <li>Band two (£62.10) - all the treatments in band one plus fillings, extractions and root canal treatment</li>
        <li>Band three (£269.30) - all treatments in band one and two plus crowns, dentures and bridges</li>
      </ul>
      <p>People on low incomes, pregnant women and under 18s or under 19 and in full-time education are exempt from charges.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of treatments delivered each year are provided free.</p>
      <p>However, the exemption system has been criticised for being overly complex and has been blamed for people getting fined for wrongly claiming free dental care.</p>
      <h3>How many people are going without dental care?</h3>
      <p>Official NHS figures show about half of adults have not used an NHS dentist in the past two years and about four in 10 children for the past year.</p>
      <p>But that does not mean that they are all going without care.</p>
      <p>Some patients may feel they do not need to go, while large numbers pay to see dentists privately.</p>
      <p>The figures also do not cover those who get care from specialist community teams, such as those with mental health problems, learning disabilities and some people in care homes.</p>
      <p>No data is published on the actual number of people going without care when they need it.</p>
      <p>Labour has pointed to figures suggesting one in five delays going because they cannot afford to see dentists, but that is from research a decade ago.</p>
      <h3>Will this policy solve the problem?</h3>

      <p>In theory, free checks should make a difference. The British Dental Association points to data from Scotland, which has had free check ups since 2006, that shows higher rates of NHS dentistry use.</p>
      <p>BDA chair Mick Armstrong said the system of exemptions was complex so simplifying the system should encourage more people to come forward for check ups - although they still face the prospect of charges if they need any work done.</p>
      <p>But he also said workforce problems needed to be addressed if access was going to improve significantly.</p>
      <p>Research by the BDA has suggested three quarters of NHS dental surgeries have vacancies they struggle to fill.</p>
      <p>"Any plans to boost access must go hand-in-hand with support for a service facing serious recruitment problems.</p>
      <p>"NHS dentistry cannot be delivered without NHS dentists."</p>
