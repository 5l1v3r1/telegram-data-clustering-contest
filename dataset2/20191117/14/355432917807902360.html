      <h1>Scalise: Trump wouldn't have sold Ukraine missiles if he only cared about Biden investigations</h1>

      <p>House Minority Whip <a href="https://thehill.com/people/steve-scalise">Steve Scalise</a> (R-La.) on Sunday pushed back against claims by witnesses in the House’s impeachment inquiry that <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s only concern in Ukraine was securing an investigation into former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>’s son, citing as evidence the fact that the White House sold the country Javelin missiles.</p>
      <p>Fox News’ <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-chris-wallace">Chris Wallace</a> asked Scalise about State Department official David Holmes’ testimony that Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> told him Trump did not care about Ukraine beyond the possibility of an investigation.</p>
      <p>“If that was the case, then President Trump wouldn’t have done all the things he’s done to help Ukraine stand up to Russia,” Scalise responded, citing an increase in aid to Ukraine under the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>Wallace pushed back, asking Scalise why the aid to Ukraine was delayed in the first place.</p>
      <p>“Part of what congress appropriated had language attached to it that required the administration make sure Ukraine’s rooting out corruption,” Scalise responded.</p>
      <p>“[President Volodymyr] Zelensky got elected on a platform of rooting out corruption, which we’re glad about, but nobody really knew if he was going to follow through and because of Ukraine’s history of corruption, the law required that before any taxpayer money go to Ukraine the president had to ensure they’re rooting out corruption,” he added.</p>
      <p>Wallace, however, noted that Trump made no mention of corruption in either his April or July phone calls with Zelensky, according to summaries released by the White House.</p>
      <p>Wallace asked if it would “blow a hole” in Trump’s defense should Sondland testify this week that there was a quid pro quo established for the release of the aid, to which Scalise responded that “There were only two people that participated in that phone call…the real bottom line is [Zelensky] got the money.”</p>
      <p>Wallace countered that a number of the “dozen people [who] listened in on that phone call were immediately upset.”</p>
      <p>Scalise dismissed those officials as “[House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam] Schiff’s witnesses,” to which Wallace responded “these are career foreign service officers,” including National Security Council official Tim Morrison and Jennifer Williams, Vice President Pence's special adviser on Europe and Russia.</p>
