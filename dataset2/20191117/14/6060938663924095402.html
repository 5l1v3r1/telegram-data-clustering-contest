      <p>VALENCIA: World champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Marc-Marquez">Marc Marquez</a> clinched his 12th <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/MotoGP">MotoGP</a> victory of the season in Sunday's final race in Valencia ahead of French rookie <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Fabio-Quartararo">Fabio Quartararo</a>.</p>
      <p>Marquez, who secured his sixth premier category title last month, finished over a second clear of pole-sitter Quartararo who came second for the fifth time in his debut campaign.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard made a poor start from second place on the grid but steadily picked off his rivals one by one to win at Valencia for just the second time in his career.</p>
      <p>"It's been a difficult weekend because we've tried new things," said Marquez. "It's a perfect season which will be difficult to repeat."</p>
      <p>Triple MotoGP champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jorge-Lorenzo">Jorge Lorenzo</a> bid farewell to the sport with a 13th-place finish in his final race.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Spaniard announced his decision to retire on Thursday. He could be replaced by Marquez's younger brother and Moto 2 champion Alex at Honda next season.</p>
      <p>Quartararo again fell just short in his bid to become the first Frenchman to win a MotoGP race since 1999, but the 20-year-old was delighted with his first season among the elite.</p>
      <p>"Nobody could have imagined at the start of the season that I would have six pole positions and seven podiums. It's incredible to finish the season in this way," said Quartararo, who ended fifth in the overall standings.</p>
