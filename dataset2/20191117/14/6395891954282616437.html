      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Massachusetts Senate is poised to debate a bill that would ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products while also imposing a new 75% excise tax on nicotine vaping products.</p>
      <p>The bill was recently approved by the House. The Senate is expected to debate their own proposed amendments to the measure on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The ban would also apply to menthol cigarettes - a decision that has rankled some convenience store owners.</p>
      <p>Under the proposal, commercial health insurers and MassHealth would be required to cover tobacco cessation counseling and all nicotine replacement therapies. Generic versions would be offered without cost-sharing to the consumer.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the bill say their goal is to protect young people from the harmful effects of tobacco.</p>
      <p>In Massachusetts, 9,300 adults die annually from smoking.</p>
