      <h3>Kosovo vs England − Where and when to watch today’s Euro 2020 qualifier</h3>
      <p>
        <b>England are in action at Kosovo’s Fadil Vokrri Stadium this evening, having already secured their European Championship spot with an emphatic 7-0 win over Montenegro on Thursday. Southgate’s men beat Kosovo back in September in a closely contested fixture which finished 5-3 in England’s favour, though the Three Lions’ backline looked extremely vulnerable throughout. Here’s how you can tune into Kosovo vs England today. </b>

      <h3>Kosovo vs England match preview</h3>
      <p>Gareth Southgate is expected to field a similar lineup to the one that too to the field against Montenegro, which was England’s 1000th international fixture. But the pressure is off for the Three Lions. Fans will hope that the game is as high-scoring as the reverse fixture was, with excitement to match.</p>
      <p>England’s final seeding is yet to be clarified, however, but a point will seal the Three Lions’ place among the top seeds going into next summer’s tournament.</p>
      <p>Both teams have won four of their last six fixtures, but Kosovo lost 2-1 last time out when they faced the Czech Republic. England will hope to build on their midweek momentum, with hat-trick-scoring skipper Harry Kane looking to add to his international tally.</p>
      <p>England will certainly hope to leak fewer goals than they did in the reverse fixture, with Harry Maguire likely to reprise his leading role at the heart of the England defence. He partnered John Stones in central defence on Thursday and helped England to a clean sheet, flanked by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Chilwell at right- and left-back respectively.</p>
      <p>Victory against Montenegro was overshadowed by a section of England fans booing Joe Gomez, when he was substituted into the game. This follows an altercation that took place between Gomez and Raheem Sterling, for which Sterling has since taken the blame. The City star said in a statement that fans were wrong to boo Gomez as he made his way onto the pitch.</p>
