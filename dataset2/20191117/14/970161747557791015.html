      <p>Plaid Cymru has hit out at the ‘unacceptable’ Islamaphobia aimed at one of its activists, pictured wearing the niqab.</p>
      <p>The Welsh nationalist party’s tweet attracted countless discriminatory comments about scientist Sahar Al-Faifi, some of which falsely linked her to Islamic terrorists.</p>
      <p>The string of vile replies came in response to the party posting a link to a campaign video, accompanied by a screenshot of Ms Al-Faifi, who is one of many people included in the footage.</p>
      <p>She is pictured wearing the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/muslim/">Muslim</a> face veil, which is often confused with a burkha.</p>
      <p>One responder, @karolJacquin or ‘Karol’, replied with a string of extreme videos and pictures of a ‘killer sect’ in the Middle East.</p>

        <figcaption>‘Lady Janeicorn’ labelled the picture of Ms Al-Faifi ‘repugnant’ (Picture: Twitter)</figcaption>

      <p>She claimed that Ms Al-Faifi ‘follows an Islamic religious sect that doesn’t believe in diversity’ adding that the ‘killer’ sect would ‘slowly penetrate communities until they’re strong then they’ll reveal their true colours’.</p>

      <p>Another, @svallerine or ‘Scott’, who describes himself as pro-Brexit and pro-Conservatives, wrote: ‘Who am I voting for ?A letterbox?Ghost from Pac-Man ? (sic)’</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/07/boris-johnson-wont-apologise-saying-women-burkas-look-like-letter-boxes-7812073/"> Boris Johnson, has refused to apologise for comparing women who wear veils to letterboxes</a>.</p>
      <p>There has been a reported spike in hate crimes against Muslims across the UK and last week, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/muslim-women-fear-safety-boris-johnson-scraps-islamophobia-inquiry-11075651/">Muslim women told Metro.co.uk that they feared for their safety</a> after Mr Johnson U-turned on his pledge to hold an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Muslim women regularly face Islamophobia.</p>

      <p>The initial picture was branded ‘repugnant’ by @Mrs Jane Coles or ‘Lady Janeicorn’ – a ‘libertarian’ who said she had ‘Welsh ancestry’ and that the image did not ‘represent the philosophy of my people’.</p>
      <p>However, amid the string of abusive messages, there were also supportive tweets.</p>
      <p>Ms Al-Faifi wrote: ‘Diolch [thank you] to all my @Plaid_Cymru friends and others. I just finished from speaking at human rights conference in London &amp; just managed to see your supportive &amp; compassionate tweets. It’s sad to see this abuse but it’s a call to work collectively for more welcoming &amp; inclusive #Wales’.</p>
      <p>Former Plaid leader Leanne Wood added that her abusers should ‘just DO ONE’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She added that the abuse provided ‘a window of understanding of the abuse some women in our country face… But they help to explain why we have seen such a spike in hate crime, especially against women.’</p>

      <p>In a follow up tweet, the party wrote: ‘The abusive Islamophobic responses to our tweet are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</p>
      <p>‘We stand with Sahar and all Muslim people in Wales and beyond.</p>
      <p>‘Wales is rich in its diversity. We are all Welsh citizens. We are all equal.’</p>
      <p>But that too was met with Islamophobic responses.</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user, @GeeMan620 ‘GWYD’, wrote: ‘You knew exactly what you were doing &amp; you should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>
      <p>‘Horrible way of playing politics -pitting people against each other just to stand back &amp; act innocent (&amp; get the attention you wanted.) hopefully it’ll backfire badly, as it should! (sic)’.</p>
