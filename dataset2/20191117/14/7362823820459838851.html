      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/kate">Kate Middleton,</a> the Duchess of Cambridge, is losing her right-hand woman.</p>
      <p>Catherine Quinn, who has worked as Middleton’s private secretary for the last two years, is moving on, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7691149/Kate-Middletons-private-secretary-quits-post-two-years-working-future-queen.html">according to the Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>The parting is said to be amicable unlike last month’s <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/12/kate-middleton-fires-longtime-aide-as-she-returned-from-honeymoon/?_ga=2.95699868.1262687427.1573909175-2091595433.1573909175">abrupt departure of loyal aide</a> Sophie Agnew who was canned after returning from her honeymoon.</p>

      <p>The Oxford-educated Quinn not only helped Middleton with her appointments and engagements, but also worked on the future queen’s “early years” project helping children avoid addiction and crime later in life.</p>
      <p>Quinn’s decision to leave so soon was considered unusual because such appointments are usually years long. But sources told the Daily Mail that Quinn “wants more time for other interests.”</p>
