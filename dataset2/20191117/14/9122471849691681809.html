      <h1>Urban Meyer Reacts To Ohio State Football’s 10-0 Start</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:13:26+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State continued to roll on Saturday, as the Buckeyes went to Rutgers and came away with a blowout victory. Ryan Day’s team is now 10-0 on the regular season.</p>
      <p>It’s been a pretty perfect regular season for the Columbus, Ohio program, which has not lost any steam in the wake of Urban Meyer’s retirement.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State head coach, who stepped down following the 2018 season, continues to watch the Buckeyes closely.</p>
      <p>Meyer, now an analyst for FOX, reacted to the Buckeyes’ 10-0 start on Twitter.</p>

      <p>As Ohio State’s head coach, Meyer would always say that the best thing about being 10-0 is the chance to get to 11-0.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes will get that chance next weekend. It’ll be tough, as Ohio State will host Penn State at Ohio Stadium in Columbus.</p>
      <p>Kickoff is set for noon E.T. on FOX.</p>
