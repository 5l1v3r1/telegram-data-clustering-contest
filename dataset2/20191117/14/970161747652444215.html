      <p>The Crown season 3 viewers were left heartbroken and in tears over the show’s depiction of the 1966 Aberfan disaster that claimed the lives of 116 children and 28 adults.</p>
      <p>In the new season, the third episode is focused entirely on the disaster, as well as the government failures to have done something sooner and the Royal family’s less-than brisk reaction to what happened.</p>
      <p>After a period of heavy rain, a colliery spoil tip collapsed on 21 October, 1966, sending its contents down to the small Wales village below and covering numerous streets and Pantglas Junior <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite efforts to save those who were buried, many were killed immediately and it took a week to recover all the bodies. 109 of them were children between eight and 10 in Pantglas Juniors.</p>
      <p>Viewers were devastated as they witnessed the colossal effect the disaster had on the quaint village, with hundreds of children having to be identified in a church which had become a makeshift mortuary to deal with the number of bodies who were buried underneath the slurry.</p>

      <p>Unaware of the extremity of the event, Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) is seen brushing off the incident and initially refusing to attend, claiming: ‘The crown visits hospitals, not the scenes of accidents.’</p>
      <p>The stoic queen does eventually make an appearance, eight days later, and in notes at the end of the episode it’s declared that her slow reaction remains ‘one of her biggest regrets as monarch’.</p>

      <p>Viewers praised the blunt portrayal of the disaster that happened, which included the burial of the school, the frantic relief efforts made by those in the village, and the demand for those responsible to be held to account.</p>
      <h3>The emotional scenes also left viewers in tears as they shared their sadness for those who were lost, and what they learned about the disaster, online.</h3>

      <p>For the Aberfan episode, producers worked closely with those who continue to be affected by what happened there.</p>
      <p>Writer Peter Morgan offered counselling for real relatives and neighbours who agreed to participate in the show’s recreation, which included the mass funeral.</p>
      <p>It was the first time those affected had been offered the service, and the team have since vowed to help arrange for more mental health care for those who were there during the disaster.</p>
      <p>‘The production team made spectacular efforts to show respect and consideration,’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/television-drama-the-crown-portrays-aberfan-disaster">he told The Observer</a>.</p>
      <p>‘But I underestimated how raw it still was. The best you have to rely on is your conscience and your own belief in what the truth is.’</p>
