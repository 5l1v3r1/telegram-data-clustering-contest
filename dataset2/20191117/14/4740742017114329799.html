      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:48:34+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:48</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Lewis, Geoffrey Bennett</a></address>
      <p>A mum is warning of the dangers of nicotine gum after her toddler chewed some and turned "lifeless".</p>
      <p>Sophie Balint's son Tommy, two, put some of the gum in his mouth and suffered nicotine poisoning.</p>
      <p>A neighbour trained in first-aid gave initial help before Tommy was taken to hospital and recovered.</p>
      <p>Sophie, 23, said the drama unfolded after Tommy and big brother Ozzy, four, found nicotine gum in her Port Talbot home.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/nicotine-chewing-gum-poisonous-children-17263454">She told Wales Online</a>: "We were redecorating my mother's house and the boys went in the bedroom and must have just thought it was chewing gum.</p>
      <p>"It was in their mouths for a couple of minutes and the next thing Tommy starting crying and saying he had a bad belly.</p>
      <p>"Within five minutes he started being sick and within about 15 or 20 minutes he was lifeless lying on the floor.</p>
      <p>"He couldn't lift his arms and his eyes were rolling.</p>
      <p>"Luckily the next door neighbour was a first aider so he came to help.</p>
      <p>"He was on the phone to the ambulance and we had to lie him on the sofa flat and keep him awake."</p>

      <p>Large amounts of nicotine can prove "life threatening" to children.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of nicotine toxicity overdose or poisoning including vomiting, sweating, drowsiness, shaking, confusion and seizures.</p>
      <p>By the time an ambulance arrived Tommy had come round.</p>
      <p>Sophie said: "The doctors said 80% of it had gone by that time.</p>
      <p>"It was only 4mg nicotine so that was quite low.</p>
      <p>"They said if he had chewed the whole packed it could have shut his organs down.</p>
      <p>"They did some tests to check his heart and check his blood but he was back to normal.</p>
      <p>"The doctor who saw Tommy was shocked, he had never seen anything like this. He had no idea how toxic it is."</p>
      <p>
        <b>'It was so scary'</b>
      </p>
      <p>She described what happened as terrifying.</p>
      <p>She added: "In the house you wouldn't keep paracetamol in a drawer but there might be chewing gum.</p>
      <p>"People don't know about this. It was so scary."</p>
