      <p>Dandruff in dogs can stem from something as simple as dry, winter weather or it could be <a href="https://www.care.com/c/stories/6309/7-home-remedies-for-dog-dandruff/">caused by one of a wide range of underlying health issues</a> which will warrant a trip the vet. Once you have confirmed clean bill of health and ruled out any serious afflictions, you'll be happy to know that there are dog shampoos specifically designed for dandruff. The <a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/best-dog-shampoos-for-dandruff/">best dog shampoos for dandruff</a> are formulated for canines to help soothe flaky skin, but there are a few things to know before you buy.</p>
      <p>While it may be tempting to bathe your dog with a human anti-dandruff shampoo that you might already own, it's important to buy one especially formulated for dogs. Since people and canines have <a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/grooming/evr_dg_shampoo_for_dogs">different skin pH levels</a>, using a human shampoo on a dog may actually further aggravate and make their dry, flaky skin worse. Look for shampoos made with natural, antifungal ingredients to treat your dog's dry skin. Dog shampoos for dandruff are often made with ingredients like oatmeal and aloe vera that can help soothe itchy skin more naturally.</p>
      <p>But, if you've tried shampoos to no avail, you might be better off consulting with your vet for a treatment that is prescribed based on the specific conditions of your dog's skin. But keep scrolling down for more details on the three <a href="https://www.puppydogger.com/best-dandruff-dog-shampoo/">best dog shampoos for dandruff</a>.</p>
