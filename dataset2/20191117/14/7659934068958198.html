      <p>Lebanon’s outgoing prime minister is harshly criticizing the party of the country’s president after weeks of delay in forming a new Cabinet.<br/><br/>A statement released Sunday by Saad Hariri’s office called the policies of Michel Aoun’s party “irresponsible,” the Associated Press reported.<br/><br/>Almost three weeks after Hariri resigned amid massive anti-government protests, Aoun has yet to call for consultations with parliamentary blocs’ leaders to name a new premier.<br/><br/>Nationwide demonstrations began on Oct. 17 against new taxes amid a plunging economy. <br/><br/>They’re now calling for the downfall of the political elite who have run the country since the 1975-90 civil war.<br/><br/>Some major factions in Lebanon’s sectarian political system want to keep Hariri in the new government. <br/><br/>They want him to form a cabinet of politicians and technocrats. for his part, Hariri is insisting on only technocrats.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Lebanon slipped deeper into political crisis on Sunday after the withdrawal of a top candidate for prime minister fruther narrowed the chances of creating a government needed to enact urgent reforms.<br/><br/>Mohammad Safadi, a former finance minister, withdrew his candidacy late on Saturday, saying it was too difficult to form a "harmonious" government with broad political support.<br/><br/>Safadi was the first candidate who had appeared to win some consensus among Lebanon's fractious sectarian-based parties since Hariri quit as prime minister on Oct. 29.<br/><br/>However, protesters denounced the choice of Safadi, a prominent businessman and longtime politician they said was part of the elite they sought to oust.<br/><br/>"We are in a deadlock now. I don't know when it will move again. It is not easy," said a senior political source.<br/><br/>"The financial situation doesn't tolerate any delay."<br/><br/>According to Reuters, another political source described efforts to form a new government as "back to square one."</p>
