      <p>Havana, Cuba.- Some 224 aid-workers returned to Cuba on this first trip, out of more than 700 who were working in the South American nation as part of the bilateral medical collaboration program.</p>
      <p>After the arbitrary detention of several health collaborators, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the decision to withdraw all aid-personnel to Cuba.</p>
      <p>The Cuban Medical Brigade spent 13 years in different parts of the Bolivian geography, where it saved lives and gave back or improved the eyesight to around 700 thousand people. (<a href="http://www.rhc.cu/en%20">RHC</a>)</p>
