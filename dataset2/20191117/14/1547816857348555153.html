        <b>American rapper Will.i.am has accused a flight attendant of racism and aggressive behaviour during his recent flight to Sydney, full story inside</b>
      </p>
      <p>Though rarely, celebrities are bound to come across an unpleasant flight experience at least once in their lives. One such case is that of American rapper William Adams, popularly known as Will.i.am, who allegedly underwent racist attacks during his recent flight. Taking to his Twitter account, the Black Eyed Peas star has accused a Qantas flight attendant of racism during his flight from Brisbane to Sydney. In fact, he also publicly shamed the attendant by sharing a picture of hers.</p>
      <p>As per Williams, the “aggressive” encounter took place when the Qantas employee accused him of not listening to the safety demonstration and upon his exit, the rapper was met by five police officials. Sharing his encounter on social media, he wrote, "I’m currently on a flight from Brisbane to Sydney. I’m sorry to say me and my group have experienced they worse service due to an overly aggressive flight attendant. I don’t want to believe she [is] racist, but she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour."</p>

      <p>Williams added that the woman in question "was beyond rude and took it to the next level by calling the police".  Further, he added, "Thank God the other passengers testified that SHE was out of Control." The rapper revealed that they called the cops because he "couldn’t hear the PA while making beats on the plane wearing noise-cancelling headphones."</p>

      <p>A spokesperson from Qantas, however, rubbished all the claims in his/her official statement to The Daily Telegraph. They said, “There was a misunderstanding on board, which seems to have been exacerbated by will.i.am wearing noise-cancelling headphones and not being able to hear instructions from the crew. We completely reject the suggestion this had anything to do with race. We’ll be following up with Will.i.am and wish him well for the rest of the tour.” (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/(ALSO%20READ%20-%20Jennifer%20Lopez%20Spotted%20Hanging%20Out%20With%20Her%20Fiance%20Alex%20Rodriguez%20And%20Ex-Husband%20Marc%20Anthony-VIDEO)">Jennifer Lopez Spotted Hanging Out With Her Fiance Alex Rodriguez And Ex-Husband Marc Anthony-VIDEO</a>)<br/><br/><i>image source: twitter/iamwill</i></p>
