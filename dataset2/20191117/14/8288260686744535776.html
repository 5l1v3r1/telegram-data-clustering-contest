      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | AVFC meet Newcastle United at Villa Park, looking to return to winning ways</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:35:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> striker Darren Bent feels the returning Jota will offer Dean Smith's men a 'huge boost' when they host Newcastle United next weekend.</p>
      <p>The summer signing is back in first team training, looking to make his return from a hernia injury that has kept him sidelined since the win over Norwich.</p>

      <p>Prior to that injury, the former Birmingham City man had been an unused sub in three Premier League games on the spin, but Bent is backing him to make an impact on his return.</p>
      <p>“Yeah it could be a huge boost, he’s got that extra bit of quality," Bent told <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-bent-drools-over-quality-aston-villa-player-who-could-soon-provide-huge-boost/">Football Insider.</a></p>
