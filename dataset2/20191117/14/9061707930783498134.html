      <h1>'As good' - Jayden Bogle compared favourably to Premier League right-backs</h1>
      <h2>'Jayden Bogle is up there as the best right-back in the Championship'</h2>

      <p>Jayden Bogle will learn from his high-profile mistake against Nottingham Forest, says former <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> striker Kevin Wilson.</p>
      <p>The Rams defender gifted Lewis Grabban the winning goal for the Reds in the East Midlands derby clash at the City Ground, his wayward back-pass seized on by the Forest striker and dispatched past Kelle Roos.</p>
      <p>But Wilson has backed the 19-year-old to bounce back from his costly error.</p>

      <p>"Jayden Bogle is up there as the best right-back in the Championship and as good as some of those playing in the Premier League,” Wilson told RamsTV.</p>
      <p>“He made a mistake at Forest, but it happens to players all the time on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“For Jayden, it’s about how he comes out of it and how he goes forward now. He will learn from it I am sure because as players that’s what it is all about.”</p>
