        <b>Welcome to this week’s top social media stories: A new dating app, a new TikTok clone, a new look for YouTube and no more likes on Instagram.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The day has come: <a href="https://wersm.com/category/other/instagran">Instagram</a> has started testing removing likes globally.

While first results are showing a decrease in overall engagement, users seem to be welcoming of the new “like-free” feed.</p>
      <p>But Instagram was also busy “cloning” TikTok this week, with the launch of the long-awaited “Reels” in Brazil.</p>
