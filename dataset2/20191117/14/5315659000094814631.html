      </p>
      <p>The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall have arrived in New Zealand for their week-long visit to the country.</p>
      <p>Their Royal Highnesses landed at Base Auckland at Whenuapai this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Prince and Duchess were greeted by the Governor-General, Dame Patsy Reddy.</p>
      <p>This is their third joint visit to New Zealand and first in four years. Their Royal Highnesses will travel to the Bay of Islands, including the Waitangi Treaty Grounds, Christchurch and Kaikōura.</p>
      <p>The public will get the opportunity to see The Prince and The Duchess in Auckland’s Viaduct Harbour on Tuesday 19 November; Christchurch Cathedral Square on Friday 22 November; and The Prince of Wales will visit Kaikōura on Saturday 23 November.</p>

      <p>During their visit The Prince and The Duchess will visit programmes and organisations working in areas they are committed to supporting. The Prince will focus on environmental issues, with particular emphasis on tackling plastic waste. The Duchess will continue her commitment to supporting women who have suffered from domestic violence by highlighting the work of organisations in this field, as well as those that encourage active ageing.</p>
      <p>The following events are scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Morning – Wreath laying ceremony at Mt Roskill War Memorial Park (The Prince and The Duchess)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Mt Roskill War Memorial cairn was erected in 1958, to complement the existing War Memorial Hall. The cairn is made of New Zealand granite, from Coromandel. The Mt Roskill War Memorial Park underwent a renovation in 2015 for the Centenary of World War 1. In 2016 a memorial was erected in the park to acknowledge men from Niue who fought with the 3rd Māori Contingent in World War 1. The majority of Auckland’s Niuean community can trace their ancestry back to these men.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will commence with a drum roll and the New Zealand National Anthem will be sung before His Royal Highness lays a wreath. After pausing for a moment of reflection, the Last Post will sound, the New Zealand and Niuean flags will be lowered to half mast and the call to remembrance will be read. A minute’s silence will follow. Their Royal Highnesses will learn of the experience of Niuean soldiers who served during World War I and Her Royal Highness will place a floral tribute on the memorial. Their Royal Highnesses will be introduced to Ode Readers and gathered veterans before departing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Morning – Visit to Wesley Community Centre (The Prince and The Duchess)</b>

        <b>Afternoon - Critical Design visit (The Prince)</b>

      </p>

During the 1953-54 Royal Tour of New Zealand, Queen Elizabeth II personally presented her Colour to the RNZAF. The presentation was made at Whenuapai during a ceremonial parade on 28 December 1953. As the Colour is now worn, a replacement has been received and is to be formally presented.</p>
      <p>Their Royal Highnesses will be greeted on the parade ground by Air Vice Marshal Andrew Clark (Chief of Air Force) who will introduce Their Royal Highnesses to other members of the RNZAF. Elements of the Pōwhiri will be explained to Their Royal Highnesses and His Royal Highness will participate in the <i>Wero (Challenge)</i> after which Their Royal Highnesses will be invited to hongi. His Royal Highness will take the Royal Salute, inspect the Guard of Honour and as Marshal of the RNZAF, will oversee the consecration and presentation of the Colour.</p>
