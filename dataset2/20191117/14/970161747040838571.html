      <p>Liverpool defender <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a> has left the Netherlands squad due to ‘personal reasons’ and will not play in their final Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The centre-back skippered his nation at Windsor Park against Northern Ireland on Saturday night, helping to secure the one point his side needed to qualify for next summer’s tournament courtesy of a 0-0 draw.</p>
      <p>Although the Netherlands can still qualify as group winners if they beat Estonia and Germany lose, their final qualifying match has effectively become a dead rubber.</p>

      <p>And they will have to play the match without their captain, with a statement from the Dutch national team confirming he had been given permission to leave the squad early.</p>
      <p>The announcement explained: ‘National team coach Ronald Koeman cannot rely on VirgiI van Dijk on Tuesday against Estonia.</p>

      <p>‘The captain of the Dutch national team has to let go of the game due to personal circumstances and has since left the Orange training camp.’</p>
      <p>Van Dijk is not believed to be injured despite managing several niggles this season, and played the full 90 minutes against Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The former Southampton defender recently spoke about his relationship with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and credited the German with getting the best out of him.</p>

      <p>‘I have a very similar connection with Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool as I had earlier with Ronald Koeman at Southampton and I still have with Koeman with the national team,’ said Van Dijk last week.</p>
      <p>‘Like Koeman, Klopp knows exactly how to get the best out of me – by being critical. When the media are hyping me and being very positive, he will downplay the praise all that – often with a wink.’</p>
