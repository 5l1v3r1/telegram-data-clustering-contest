      <h1>Ford F-150 Raptor Might Have New Reason To Fear Chevy Silverado</h1>
      <h2>Shocking it's taken this long.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:05:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-150-raptor">Ford F-150 Raptor</a> was an instant smash hit when the original premiered for 2010 and has remained so until today. Ford's chief truck rivals, Chevrolet and Ram, were caught somewhat off-guard by the Raptor's popularity and it's taking each of them time to offer a proper response. Fortunately, Chevy might have something cooking thanks to a certain aftermarket tuner it's already doing business with. <a href="https://www.musclecarsandtrucks.com/silverado-bison-chevrolet-hints-at-future-collaborations-with-aev/">Muscle Cars and Trucks</a> spoke to the Silverado's marketing director, Hugh Milne, about the possibility of a Silverado Bison. You know, like a larger counterpart to the Colorado ZR2 Bison that was built in partnership with aftermarket outfitter <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevy-colorado-zr2-bison-creators-are-being-awesome-again">American Expedition Vehicles</a>, or AEV.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/chevrolet-responds-to-colorado-zr2-bison-demand">Colorado ZR2 Bison</a> is also a smash hit with a nearly $50,000 price tag. Surely there's room for a Silverado version. "I think there's a history there with Chevrolet and AEV, and you're going to see that history continue. Especially as we look at more off-road opportunities," Milne said.</p>

      <p>Okay, but what about a Silverado Bison, specifically? "Who knows, right? The possibilities are endless. You look at what we've done with Trail Boss, and I wouldn't rule anything out." MCT also brought the subject up with AEV directly, but no direct response was offered.</p>
      <p>In the past, AEV has pointed out that half-ton pickup trucks pose "a tough business case" because the enthusiast market typically prefers pre-runner style trucks that can have their way with sand dunes and the like. Technically speaking, an AEV-outfitted <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/silverado-1500">Silverado 1500</a> is totally possible. It could simply offer the same or similar features found on the Colorado ZR2 Bison, such as hot-stamped steel skid plates, unique wheels, a winch-ready front bumper, and tubular steel bumper and side skirt protection.</p>

      <p>The fact that the Colorado ZR2 Bison kit is a $5,750 addition on top of the base price has not deterred buyers, and Ford Raptor buyers easily pay upwards of around $60,000. Clearly, there's a market out there, but the question is whether Chevy, with or without AEV's help, will ultimately go for it. They may soon be forced to because the Raptor will soon receive its first real competitor from Ram, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ram-rebel-trx-prototype-already-testing-with-800-hp-demon-engine">Hellcat-powered Rebel TRX</a>.</p>
