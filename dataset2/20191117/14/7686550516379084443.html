      <h1>Swansea City 'scanning the globe' for talent as chief makes January transfer admission</h1>
      <h2>The recruitment head gave an update on his work so far at the Liberty</h2>

      <p>Swansea City's head of recruitment Andy Scott says the club are "scanning the globe" for talent to take the club to the next level.</p>
      <p>Scott joined Swansea at the end of the summer transfer window, and although he hasn't been in SA1 long, he has quickly got to work to help Steve Cooper and his team identify the best players available - both at home and abroad.</p>
      <p>Working closely with the head coach, as well as chairman Trevor Birch, club stalwarts Leon Britton and Alan Curtis, Scott says it has been frantic so far but that he was very much enjoying the challenge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.swanseacity.com/news/andy-scott-its-non-stop-i-love-it">He told the club website</a>: “It’s a non-stop business. But I love it.</p>
      <p>"As I came in so late in the window it meant we had to use our contacts and our immediate knowledge.</p>
      <p>"Sam Surridge, Aldo Kalulu, Kristoffer Peterson, Ben Wilmot and Freddie Woodman came in, and they were all cases of utilising our contacts and knowledge of the players.</p>
      <p>"Moving forward the recruitment department and its structure is a work in progress.</p>
      <p>"It’s a really good club to work at. I have had a very good relationship with Trevor Birch, Leon Britton and Steve Cooper. The communication and honesty between us is vital."</p>
      <p>Scott, who has managed at Brentford, identified another key man to the process as well, adding that the academy set-up also dovetails in with the bigger picture at Fairwood.</p>
      <p>“The appointment of Steve Rands has been positive to the recruitment structure too," he said.</p>
      <p>“I work with analysts on a consultancy basis along with Steve and his team. I also liaise closely with Nigel Rees and the academy.</p>
      <p>“We are looking at academy and development level recruitment – that’s locally and abroad. We have data on 88 countries in the world, so we are scanning the globe for young talent that we can nurture here and turn into first-team players for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea-city-fc">Swansea City</a>.</p>

      <p>“I have a consultancy group working with me at present, but Steve Rands’ input is a massive help to me. We have a few scouts working for us, but we are reviewing the structure regularly and we need to make sure we get things right.</p>
      <p>“We base everything on Swansea’s style. That is vital in the short and long term. The Swansea Way is integrated into all levels here, and that is a massive help in terms of recruitment because we know the type of player we are after, and the player knows what type of club we are.</p>
      <p>“The difficulty comes when a player is in a team which does not play your style. That is when your scouting qualities come in.”</p>
      <p>The summer recruitment has certainly paid off, with Woodman, Surridge and Wilmot all playing big parts in Swansea's season to date. And while Scott is looking ahead to January and planning for all eventualities, he did sound a warning over possible departures.</p>
      <p>“We are working towards the next transfer window, and that includes preparations for the possibility of players leaving the club,” he said.</p>

      <p>“In football you have to be as prepared as you possibly can for every outcome, so having a plan for A, B, C and beyond is vital.</p>
      <p>“There are a few priority positions in the squad which can push us on in the final four months of the season.</p>
      <p>“But we have to cover ourselves if a club comes in for a player.</p>
      <p>“We are also aware that we simply cannot waste money here.</p>
      <p>“If we need a particular player for a position, I will have a list of players already drawn up. Then the process of videos, reports and background checks come in to play. I’ll also be working on options two and three in case it doesn’t work out.</p>
      <p>“I will then present that to Trevor, Leon and Steve and they decide what happens next.</p>
      <p>“The transfer window can be unpredictable, but we aim to be as prepared as we possibly can.”</p>
