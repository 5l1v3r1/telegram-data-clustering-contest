      <p>The new ferry service offers a unique travel experience to our residents and visitors and provides them with greater access to our waterways and popular destinations.</p>
      <p>The new ferry trial is part of the Gold Coast City Transport Strategy 2031 to provide more travel alternatives to the car.</p>
      <p>The City of Gold Coast has been working in partnership with the State Government, Gold Coast Waterways Authority, Maritime Safety Queensland, Water Police, Marina Mirage and Sea World to develop the trial ferry service.</p>
      <p>The two-year Hopo ferry service trial will initially stop at five popular waterfront precincts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sea World at Main Beach</li>
        <li>Broadwater Parklands at Southport</li>
        <li>Marina Mirage at Main Beach</li>
        <li>Home of the Arts (HOTA) at Surfers Paradise</li>
        <li>Appel Park at Surfers Paradise</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the ferry trial is successful, additional ferry stops may be considered.</p>
      <p>Timetabled ferry services will start on Sunday 8 December 2019 and you can buy a day ticket and hop on and off as much as you want within one calendar day for $25, or purchase a single ticket from as little as $4.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be purchased online at hopo.com.au, on the ferry, or at a Sea World Cruises terminal.</p>
      <p>The ferry will stop approximately every hour, with one ferry heading upstream and the other heading downstream.</p>
