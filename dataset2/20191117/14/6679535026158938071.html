      <h1>Tree census launched as pilot project in Mysuru</h1>
      <h2>It will determine number of trees in the city and the extent of the green cover</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:52:52+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-MYSURU-119974/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent MYSURU</a></address>
      <p>The number of trees in the city and the extent of the green cover is set to be documented and recorded through a census, which was inaugurated on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The tree census will be conducted by volunteers under the aegis of the Project Vruksha Foundation, Bengaluru, which has conducted tree census in parts of Bengaluru and the template will be replicated in Mysuru as well.</p>
      <p>The Forest Department has teamed up with the Project Vruksha Foundation but it will have a limited role as the documentation and enumeration will be conducted by the volunteers while the department will only oversee it.</p>
      <p>Vijay Nishanth, founder-member, Project Vruksha Foundation, said the exercise will give the authorities a baseline data about the number of trees in the city.</p>
      <p>Once the tree is enumerated and digitally documented it will also serve as an evidence of its presence and cannot be disputed or the records tampered with, he added.</p>
      <p>At present, there is no data pertaining to the number of trees in Mysuru and the extent of green cover is a random figure. The census will rectify that.</p>
      <p>Besides, it will also ascertain the approximate age of the trees, while data will be generated pertaining to the girth, height, species to which they belong and their location in the city.</p>
      <p>Once completed the data will also help ascertain the number of trees planted by the authorities or the public during tree plantation drives that have actually survived.</p>
      <p>Forest Department officials said they have issued permission for the census which will be taken up as a pilot project to start with in parts of Kuvempunagar.</p>
      <p>Based on the outcome, the census will be expanded to cover the entire city.</p>
      <p>Pramodadevi Wadiyar of the erstwhile royal family of Mysuru inaugurated the census and local area corporator Shivakumar and volunteers were present.</p>
      <p>Underlining the importance of the exercise, Ms.Wadiyar said it was inconceivable about 20 years ago to think of buying water but it had become common in the present times.</p>
      <p>Similarly, no one had imagined that oxygen masks would be required to breathe as air was a natural element available to all.</p>
      <p>But the pollution levels are so high in some cities that air is toxic and oxygen masks inevitable and hence called for tree planting and conservation.</p>
      <p>Mr. Nishanth said an app exclusively developed for tree enumeration will be shared with the volunteers to digitally record the details and will be put in the public domain.</p>
