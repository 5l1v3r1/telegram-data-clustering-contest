      <p>In July, the Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association and Indigenous Tourism British Columbia began collaborating on a new and unique program to assist indigenous communities in the Thompson Okanagan with tourism development.</p>
      <p>The initiative - the Indigenous Artisans Trail - reached a new stage earlier this week with the unveiling of the Indigenous Artisans Trail trailer, a mobile space created to house indigenous artwork to be offered for sale to the travelling public.</p>
      <p>Indigenous Art manager Amanda Adams says the trailer, which was launched on Wednesday, Nov. 13, is nearly complete.</p>
      <p>The Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association is working with the region’s First Nations to produce items for sale in the trailer, which will travel throughout the region, starting in March.</p>
      <p>“Our main goal is to promote, focus and educate the public on the work of interior Salish artisans,” Adams says.</p>

      <p>The tourism agency will be working with the Secwépemc, Nlaka’pamux and Sylix Nations artisans to fill the trailer with handmade artwork.</p>
      <p>She expects to have the trailer completed by the end of January, 2020, following which the unit will hit the road, travelling to two communities where any kinks will be worked out.</p>
      <p>“The items sold will be hand made Salish art. Not all pieces are alike, so there is uniqueness to each one. They aren’t just gifts, the buyer will be getting a piece of our culture and our story with each item,” she says.</p>
      <p>Adams says the trailer can be booked by parties interested in having the trailer on hand for local events.</p>
      <p>Those wishing to book it should call Adams at 778-721-5519, email her at iart@totabc.com or visit the new website at <a href="https://iart-gallery.com/">iart-gallery.com</a></p>
