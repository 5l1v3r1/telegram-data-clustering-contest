      <h1>Teacher's wonderful idea to stop pressure on parents getting gifts for school staff</h1>
      <h2>This is what Christmas is really all about</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:31:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Graham, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Christmas should be a time to help those less fortunate and celebrate relationships.</p>
      <p>And in one moving and inspiring letter one teacher has urged parents to think of the 'real meaning of Christmas' and not buy her a single present.</p>
      <p>Steff Ravenhall was delighted last week when her daughter, Harriet Waring, came home with the letter, reports <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mum-shares-teachers-brilliant-idea-17268030">Chronicle Live.</a></p>
      <p>The note, from seven-year-old Harriet's teacher Mrs Gardener, thanked parents for their "kind generosity" but told them: "I would like to reduce your stress a little and ask that you don't buy me a gift."</p>
      <p>She wrote: "I thoroughly enjoy teaching your children and my job is a pleasure to do."</p>

      <p>But this wasn't just a ban on presents - instead, Mrs Gardener, deputy head and year two teacher at St Patrick's Roman Catholic Voluntary Aided School, in Stanley, Durham, invited families to send in an anonymous donation of no more than £2 to help those in greater need.</p>
      <p>And the request was not only charitable, but educational too.</p>
      <p>She said: "This half term we will be focusing on money in maths and the real meaning of Christmas in our RE lessons. With this in mind I would like the children to be involved in the social responsibility of giving and and kindness and plan to support a local family."</p>
      <h3>'I thought it was really heart-warming'</h3>
      <p>Once the envelopes have been received, the children, she said, would count up the money and use it to plan which items to purchase from a local shop.</p>
      <p>Receiving the letter, Steff said she was impressed by the idea, and shared a picture of it on Facebook, in the hope of encouraging other schools to do the same.</p>
      <p>She said: "I just thought it was really heart-warming, and it obviously takes the pressure off, because you do worry about getting the teachers presents at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"My daughter has been to a few different schools and it's always a topic of conversation for the parents, who is getting something, who is not going to bother, how much they're spending. Everyone just wants to get it right.</p>
      <p>"The bit that got me the most was the fact that it was going to a local family. It's an important age, in year two, to be learning about the value of money, which is a really important lesson as well. And it teaches them that it's not just about receiving, it's about giving back.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen another school do anything like this, lots of teachers will say to you 'oh, don't bother', but actually getting a letter saying 'here's what you can do instead' and there's a lesson kids are learning at the same time, that's what's really good about it."</p>
      <p>The mum says she's already received messages online from teachers hoping to share the idea, and Steff's post has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.</p>
