      <p>Feisty <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/sharon-osbourne/">Sharon Osbourne</a> is in a feud with renowned music blogger <a href="https://nypost.com/2010/01/04/blogger-bags-big-music-game/?_ga=2.79134935.2102153189.1573520044-132223664.1563816343">Bob Lefsetz</a> over his coverage of <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/ozzy-osbourne/">Ozzy</a>’s latest single and career.</p>
      <p>Sharon has slammed Lefsetz, author of the Lefsetz Letter and a former Variety columnist, as a know-nothing brown-noser. Then he fired back claiming he knew about her rocker husband’s cheating ways and never wrote about it.</p>
      <p>After Lefsetz wrote about Ozzy’s new single, “Under the Graveyard,” which is getting good reviews — Sharon wrote Lefsetz an e-mail that he leaked: “You’ve been pretty disrespectful whenever you’ve mentioned [Ozzy] in the past.” She added: “In the past when you have tried to write about British music from the 70s, 80s &amp; 90s you’ve always got it wrong … As for Ozzy and Black Sabbath, you don’t understand the music, you don’t understand the culture and now are only writing about Ozzy now to try and be hip because you’ve heard his new album is going to be a landmark album for him.”</p>

      <p>She called Lefsetz a “typical LA brown nose that wants to get on a bandwagon” and told him, “Keep writing about the people in LA whose asses you are so far up your eyes are brown.” She added, “If you mention millennials one more f–king time I’m going to puke!”</p>
      <p>Lefsetz has been involved in feuds with <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/kid-rock">Kid Rock</a> and <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/gene-simmons">Gene Simmons</a>. In 2010, Taylor Swift released the song “Mean,” <a href="https://pagesix.com/2014/08/20/a-rundown-of-taylor-swifts-biggest-haters/">rumored to be about his review</a> of her singing at the Grammys: “In one fell swoop, Taylor … consigned herself to the dustbin of teen phenoms.”</p>
      <p>Biting back at Sharon, he wrote in an e-mail blast, “Sharon, you self-hating meeskite. No good deed goes unpunished. My policy is not to respond to wankers, but I know if I don’t print your e-mail you’ll post it elsewhere to rile me up, to get publicity.” He added, somewhat gratuitously, “So Ozzy cheats on you. Yup, I’ve got my sources. I didn’t print this confidential information before it became public because my word is my bond.”</p>

      <p>Sharon opened up about Ozzy’s infidelities in 2017, saying, “There wasn’t just one woman; there were six of them.”</p>
