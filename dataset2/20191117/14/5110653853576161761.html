      <p>The Patriots (8-1) will travel to play the Eagles (5-4) for the first time since Super Bowl 52 in Sunday's marquee <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-schedule-week-11-games-today-tv-channels-times-scores/r0rlms6mlk3l1finrne3igfiu">Week 11</a> NFL matchup(4:25 p.m. ET, CBS).</p>
      <p>New England will try to avenge a 41-33 loss in that final game following the 2017 season,but more important, it needs a win to better position itself for another AFC championship run in '19. Philadelphia, also coming off a bye, also could use a victory as it chases an NFC playoff berth.</p>
      <p>The Patriots suffered their first loss of the season against the Ravens in Week 9, while the Eagles beat the Bears to get back above. 500.</p>

      <h3>Betting odds for Patriots vs. Eagles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spread:</b> Patriots by 4.5</li>
        <li><b>Point total:</b> 45</li>
        <li><b>Odds:</b> Patriots -101, Eagles -109</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Patriots and Eagles are both pretty healthy going in so the line has stayed rather steady, with some sportsbooks having this as Philadelphia +4.</p>
      <h3>Patriots vs. Eagles all-time series</h3>
      <p>The Eagles lead the series 8-6, including Super Bowl 52. The Eagles have a two-game winning streak in the rare rivalry. Before that, the Patriots had won four straight.</p>
      <h3>Three trends to know</h3>
      <p>— 65 percent of spread bettors are with the Patriots to take care of their small number. But 53 percent of moneyline bettors are with the Eagles straight up.</p>
      <p>— 61 percent of bettors like the game to go over the point total with quarterbacks as good as Tom Brady and Carson Wentz on the field.</p>
      <p>— The Patriots had won and covered in four consecutive games while doing neither against the Ravens. The Eagles have failed to cover in all four of their losses.</p>
      <h3>Three things to watch</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Wentz without his wideouts</b>
      </p>
      <p>DeSean Jackson is out for the season and Alshon Jeffery will be missing this game. That means you can expect the Eagles to try to help Wentz with frequent two-tight end sets featuring Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert. Ertz will probably draw the Patriots' primary coverage attention now, but the presence of Goedert can make it tricky as he's also athletic enough to create mismatches. This development also should prompt the Eagles to be dedicated more to the running game, which has had good success of late, but with more Miles Sanders and no Jordan Howard.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brady without a running game</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Eagles have played light-out run defense at home this season and they are No. 4 overall in that category. They have been vulnerable at cornerback, but they are now back healthy there. The key for Brady is getting the ball out quickly and spreading it around on short-to-intermediate routes, which he does better than any other QB. The Eagles will try to counter with Jim Schwartz blitzing, and of late Brady has struggled with that kind of pressure.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pederson vs. Belichick</b>
      </p>
      <p>Doug Pederson out-coached Bill Belichick in Super Bowl 52 with aggressive and creative play-calling, down to the famous "Philly Special" play between Trey Burton and Nick Foles that created the touchdown cushion in the end. Burton and Foles are long gone, but there are plenty of Eagles familiar with the Patriots, and vice versa. It should be fun to see how the coaches push buttons against each other to try to stay one step ahead.</p>
      <h3>Stat that matters</h3>
      <p>The Patriots have allowed only 3 passing touchdowns all season and have recorded 19 interceptions. They also have 32 sacks as part of the No. 2 pass defense in the NFL. With limited reliable weapons from Philadelphia, the depth of New England's secondary and pass rush can play a big factor.</p>
      <h3>Patriots vs. Eagles prediction</h3>
      <p>The Eagles will come out running and play well at home with a good dose of ball control. Pederson's short history vs. Belichick help keeps Philadelphia in the game for four quarters, as well asthe hostile environment created by Eagles fans. But in the end, Brady can pick apart the Eagles on the back end and in crunch time, he'll go vintage and deliver the game-winning field-goal drive.</p>
