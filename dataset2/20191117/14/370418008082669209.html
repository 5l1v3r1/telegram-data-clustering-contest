      <p>It was only December of 2015 that hair metal legends <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe/">Mötley Crüe</a> played their “last” show in Los Angeles, thus ending their massive Final Tour. Now, amidst whispers of a possible reunion, the band has begun to fan the flames of fan rumors by retweeting a petition asking them to get back together.</p>
      <p>The petition in question is <a href="https://www.change.org/p/motley-crue-bring-motley-crue-back">a Change.org petition title ‘Bring Mötley Crüe back!’</a> The description reads, “After breaking the replay button on The Dirt film, it is clear to me that the only way to fulfill my urge for the Crüe is for you guys to get back on the road. I know it’s not just me with this opinion; your movie has once again put you in the spotlight and built an entire new generation of Crüeheads who have a NATURAL BORN RIGHT to see you on stage. If the rumors circulating about a Mötley Crüe comeback are true, then let this petition solidify it. The new fans need a new tour, PLEASE COME BACK.</p>
      <p>“If any fellow Crüeheads are reading this, please sign and share to voice your support!”</p>

      </p>
      <p>The petition has already gotten over 13,000 signatures of its 15,000-signature goal.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the band’s official Twitter posted the petition with the caption, “This is interesting…” While the tweet appears to have been deleted, several music sites picked up on the story, with <a href="https://sleazeroxx.com/motley-crue-fuel-tour-rumours-by-tweeting-online-petition-link-to-get-them-back-on-the-road/">SleazeRoxx.com</a> capturing a screenshot:</p>

      <p>It makes sense, given the year they’ve had, that Mötley Crüe would consider returning to the stage. The band’s Netflix biopic The Dirt was a massive success, and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/m%C3%B6tley-cr%C3%BCe-land-a-billboard-top-ten-spot-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade/">landed the Crüe in the Billboard Top 10 for the first time in over a decade</a>. If they were to return now, at the height of their new popularity, it would be a huge deal. That said, frontman Vince Neil once ragged on KISS for having “five farewell tours and four reunion tours”, so one wonders if he’d be interested.</p>
      <p>If Mötley Crüe reunite, we’ll let you know.</p>
