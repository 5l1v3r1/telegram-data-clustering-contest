        <b>Irish manager Mick McCarthy is keen to “surprise” those doubting his side when the Boys in Green take on Denmark in their crucial Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>McCarthy’s men know that they must win to guarantee a spot in next summer’s finals, with the Danes, <a href="https://www.11v11.com/teams/republic-of-ireland/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Denmark/">who Ireland have failed to beat in their last five games,</a> a difficult challenge standing in their way.</p>
      <p>The Danes have long been critical of the Irish style of play during the pair’s recent battles with manager Age Hareide outlining that it’s difficult for the two teams to surprise each other given the level of familiarity.</p>

      <p>So how does McCarthy feel?</p>
      <p>“I guess the only surprise to everyone tomorrow will be if we win.”</p>
      <p>Ireland are coming off the back of a draw with Georgia and a defeat to Switzerland while their opponents<a href="https://twitter.com/FAIreland/status/1193877611186999297?s=20"> have only lost one of their last 31 games in all competitions,</a> meaning it’s no surprise the Danes are favourites.</p>
      <p>In a one off game though, and playing at home, the Boys in Green will feel that they can, as they have done in the past, pull out a big result when the chips are down.</p>
      <p>McCarthy was quizzed by a Danish journalist who asked, given the recent results between the two sides, why he feels his team can get the victory they so desperately desire?</p>

      <p>The Irish boss has been around the game long enough to know that in a match of this magnitude on home soil, his side can pull off the performance needed <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/glenn-whelan-last-big-night/">to deliver a victory.</a></p>
      <p>“When people tell me that, ‘You haven’t beaten somebody for so many times’ – well, I always believe it’s about time we did and that’s the mentality that I try to instil into everybody else.</p>
      <p>“Just because it hasn’t happened before doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen again. There’s loads of places being flooded in England at the minute – they’ve never been flooded before, but they are because it’s been raining a lot.</p>
      <p>“You know, if you cover football, you cover sport, that results happen. Results happen for a reason, whether that’s us that are more motivated, it’s us that fancy the game more, it’s us that stops your team playing, your team doesn’t play as well.</p>
      <blockquote>“I just think that for us, always there’s a big performance in us that can win a game. And we drew in Denmark. You had a few chances, but nevertheless, it was a great performance and great result for us.”</blockquote>
