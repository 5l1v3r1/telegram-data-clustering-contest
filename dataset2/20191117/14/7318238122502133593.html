      <p>With a little under four weeks to go to the UK general election, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party has extending its lead in voting intention polls.</p>
      <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced all candidates standing for the Conservatives have pledged to support his deal on Britain’s exit from the European Union.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition Labour Party will hope to revive its fortunes with a manifesto launch on Thursday — its opinion poll rating is slightly up following the first week of campaigning, but the performance has been overshadowed by the Conservative surge.</p>
      <p>Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been putting her weight behind the Scottish Nationalist Party’s call for a new independence referendum next year.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson meanwhile has been promising that a Liberal Democrat government would plant 60 million trees a year — but her party’s anti-Brexit stance has not so far led to an opinion poll boost.</p>
