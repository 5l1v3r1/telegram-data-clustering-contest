      <p>This weekend, Elizabeth Banks' <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/charlies-angels/">Charlie's Angels</a> </i>reboot burst onto the scene. The film is the third cinematic reboot of the franchise and fifth take on the characters overall. Naysayers were quick to rag on Banks for her decision to reboot the franchise, but she had a comeback of her own.</p>
      <p>She spoke to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-director-profile-11573754819">Wall Street Journal</a> about the criticisms she's faced for doing another <i>Charlie's Angels </i>film. The 45-year-old actress/director said, "You've had 37 <i>Spider-Man </i>movies and you're not complaining!" She added, "I think women are allowed to have one or two action franchises every 17 years —I feel totally fine with that."</p>

      <p>Banks spoke of the disadvantages surrounding female-oriented films in the industry. For her, making <a href="https://screenrant.com/charlies-angels-2019-movie-reviews/">women feel represented</a> in the action-movie demographic was most important. "Being in a big franchise allows you to have it all," she said. "I recognize the same thing, it's almost unfair for women. The best roles are usually in small movies, but then you don't make any money. It's okay to want to make money."</p>
