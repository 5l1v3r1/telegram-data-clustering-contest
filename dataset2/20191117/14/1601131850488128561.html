      <p>It appears that Samsung is working on several new camera features that it could possibly announce with the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-s11">Galaxy S11</a>. That wouldn’t surprise anyone. Samsung has made a habit of introducing new camera features with its flagship smartphones. That’s actually what many customers actively look forward to.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-android-10-beta-update-released-for-the-galaxy-s10-download-now/">fourth One UI 2.0 beta firmware</a> that started rolling out earlier this week has dropped some hints about these new features. It also highlights the possibility that Samsung may eventually bring the ability to record 8K video.</p>
      <h3>Samsung to add powerful new camera features to the Galaxy S11</h3>
      <p>An APK <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-directors-view-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-vertical-panorama-custom-filters/">teardown</a> of the Samsung Camera app included in the latest firmware version has revealed that several new camera features are in development. <b>Director’s View</b> is one such feature. It will allow you to lock on a subject in the frame and change who’s in the close up. This feature may also allow you to record from multiple camera lenses simultaneously, something that the Filmic Pro app makes possible on the iPhone 11 Pro.</p>
      <p><b>Single Take Photo</b> is also expected to be another new addition. As per the references found in the code, this feature will let you capture the scene in a “series of pictures and short videos.” You’ll capture one by panning your phone around in a slow and steady motion for 15 seconds. Hyperlapse has been around for a while now but it seems that Samsung is now working on a version of this feature that’s primarily meant for low-light conditions. The <b>Night Hyperlapse</b> feature may simply be a combination of the existing hyperlapse and night modes. The reference to <b>Vertical Panoramas</b> suggests that Samsung is now getting ready to support the ability to take vertical panoramas. You can kind of force your phone do to this already but it’s good to see that Samsung is going to make this official.</p>
      <p>There are references to 8K video recording as well. It’s possible that this feature would debut with the Galaxy S11. The <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exynos-990-and-exynos-9830-are-the-same-chip">next flagship’s Exynos 990 processor</a> does have the capability to record 8K video at 30 frames-per-second. This would also require Samsung to upgrade the primary camera sensor on its next flagship. Rumor has it that <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-phone-with-108mp-camera/">Samsung may use its 108MP sensor</a> for the primary camera on the Galaxy S11.</p>
      <p>Nothing is set in stone just yet as far as the Galaxy S11 is concerned. One thing is for sure, we’re going to be hearing a lot more rumors about the device in the days to come. What do you think about these camera features, would they do a good job of setting the Galaxy S11 apart from the pack? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
