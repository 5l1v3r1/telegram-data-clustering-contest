      <h1>Suppliers 'nervous' as Co-op bookshop, Curious Planet owe $12 million</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Bonyhady and Max Koslowski</a></address>
      <p>The company behind famous retail brands Australian Geographic and the Co-op bookshop owes more than $12 million to toy sellers and publishers that say their payments are in some cases months overdue.</p>
      <p>And the company’s boss, Thorsten Wichtendahl, controls a major supplier that received more than $500,000 in advance for goods not yet supplied.</p>

      <p>Last week the former Australian Geographic stores – now known as Curious Planet after a bitter licensing dispute – were put up for sale, with potential buyers told it was a market leader with room to grow. Dozens of Co-op stores have closed since 2015, with the latest closure, at La Trobe University, slated for Friday.</p>
      <h3>$12.6 million owed</h3>
      <p>Internal documents seen by <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> show suppliers across both the university textbook store and the science retailer were last week owed $12.6 million, of which $8.8 million was owed for stock delivered and services rendered at least 90 days prior.</p>
      <p>One supplier, textbook publisher John Wiley &amp; Sons, was owed more than $1 million, and 26 suppliers were owed more than $100,000 each.</p>

      <p>The University of Western Australia and the Sydney University Sport and Fitness Centre were owed six figures, as were Australia Post and wholesale toys giant Independence Studios.</p>
      <p>Some suppliers said there had been payment issues since the Co-op bought Curious Planet – founded as Australian Geographic by Dick Smith in 1992 – from Myer Family Investments three years ago.</p>
      <p>"There was this confidence we were going to get paid [when the Myer family owned Australian Geographic] ... and then when Co-op took over we never ever, not once, got paid to terms," said one supplier, who declined to be named over fears the company would not pay him.</p>
      <p>Most suppliers contacted by <i>The Sydney Morning Herald </i>and <i>The Age </i>said 30- and 60-day payment terms were most common.</p>
      <p>The Co-op’s head office, according to some suppliers, has said it will pay the debts with revenue from a Christmas retail bump, and several suppliers have been placed on payment plans to assuage concerns.</p>
      <p>In response to detailed questions about the financial position of the company, a spokesman for the board of the Co-op said: "We are trading within the Corporations Act. We don’t comment on confidential information. The specific questions provided are considered as commercially confidential."</p>
      <p>The spokesman said a board meeting was held on Saturday, a day after the company provided comment, but he declined to say what happened at the meeting.</p>
      <p>Started in 1958 by students, the Co-op Bookshop offered cheap textbooks in exchange for membership. At its peak it had a presence on almost every Australian university campus.</p>
      <p>But more than two-dozen stores have closed since 2015 as <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5108o.html">frustration grew</a> in academic circles over poor service and online booksellers attracted more students.</p>
      <p>On November 22 the last Co-op store at La Trobe will stop trading, leaving it with the Australian National University, the University of Queensland and University of Technology Sydney as universities that no longer have a Co-op on campus.</p>
      <p>A La Trobe University spokeswoman said: "Business decisions are a matter for the Co-op Bookshop to comment on."</p>
      <p>A major supplier who feared his six-figure outstanding payment would never be paid, until a portion was invoiced last week, said: "I’m less worried than last week but still nervous. There’s still a nervousness. It’s 'wait and see', I guess."</p>
      <p>Several suppliers have refused to send stock until debts are paid.</p>

      <h3>CEO’s hat-trick</h3>
      <p>Unlike the Co-op's other suppliers, Jacaru Australia, a hat seller, does not appear to have trouble getting paid. It has received more than $857,000 in payments from the Co-op this year.</p>
      <p>Curious Planet now sells dozens of the company’s woollen and leather hats on its website, along with wallets, beer coolers and a dog coat, which is listed as out of stock.</p>
      <p>Through a private company called Gathor, registered to his home address in Sydney’s north shore, the Co-op’s chief executive Mr Wichtendahl is the majority owner of Jacaru, with 55 per cent of its shares.</p>
      <p>The first payment of more than $63,000 from the Co-op to Jacaru is recorded as being transferred on April 18 this year, just a day before ASIC documents show Mr Wichtendahl became one of Jacaru's directors.</p>
      <p>And while the Co-op has transferred more than $857,000 to Jacaru, as of last week it had received only about $315,000 in stock in return over the same period. Like many of the Co-op’s suppliers, Jacaru is on 30-day payment terms, meaning the Co-op has 30 days to pay for goods after it receives them, yet the company has prepaid for far more goods than it has received.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the board, on behalf of Mr Wichtendahl, reiterated he would not comment on "commercially confidential" matters when asked detailed questions about Jacaru.</p>
      <h3>A Curious period: three names in a month</h3>
      <p>The Co-op faced a challenging series of events over the past two months as it lost the rights to use the Australian Geographic brand.</p>

      <p>In 2017 the Co-op said the Australian Geographic "trademark licence and distribution agreements" were worth $6,278,000 in goodwill to the company.</p>
      <p>But last month the Co-op lost the rights to use the name after it was late paying fees, a source close to the transaction said.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for <i>Australian Geographic </i>magazine, which owns the famous name, said the agreement was terminated because the two companies "were not very well aligned and we wanted to control the brand".</p>
      <p>The Co-op first changed the stores’ name to My Geographic, which the magazine believed was misleadingly similar to Australian Geographic.</p>
      <p>After an exchange of legal letters, the Co-op <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5361d.html">rebranded the stores again</a> to Curious Planet.</p>
