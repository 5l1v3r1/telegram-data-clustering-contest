        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> will compete in the 2019<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix"> Brazilian Grand Prix</a> with a new engine as a result of his problems on Saturday. The <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> driver failed to escape from Q1 after his power source failed. Sainz picks up a penalty, but will not be pushed back as he already starts from the back. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Andreas Seidl, boss of McLaren, hoped the team would not need to introduce any more engines following the summer break. And that's what <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> and Sainz have done up until now. Since Sainz's grid position can't get any worse, McLaren have a free penalty. </p>

      <p>McLaren have virtually wrapped up the best of the rest position with only a few points required from the final two Grands Prix to ensure Renault can't catch the Woking-based team. Points will be difficult for Sainz, but with Norris starting from P11, there's a good chance he will score. </p>
