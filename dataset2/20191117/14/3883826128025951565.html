        <b>British "rock royalty" have rallied to help a highly respected American guitarist who is struggling financially after suffering a stroke.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sir Paul McCartney, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour and Jeff Lynne are among 23 stars to sign a guitar to be sold at auction.</p>
      <p>Money raised will help Jerry Donahue, who played with the folk-rock bands Fairport Convention and Fotheringay.</p>
      <p>The guitar is due to go under the hammer on 11 December in Wiltshire.</p>

      <p>The guitar - a signature Jerry Donahue Telecaster - is expected to sell for in the region of between £10,000 and £20,000.</p>
      <p>Other big names on the guitar include The Who's Pete Townshend, Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi, Dire Straits's Mark Knopfler and The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson.</p>
      <p>Mr Donahue suffered a severe stroke in 2016 and has not been able to play guitar since.</p>
      <p>Dave Pegg, bass player with Fairport Convention and one of the leaders of the fundraising drive, said the stars had come together out of "respect for Jerry".</p>
      <p>"They recognise he's one of the greatest guitarists in the world with a unique style," he said.</p>
      <p>"No one else could do the multiple string bends, which is why guitar legends like Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page admire him so much.</p>
      <p>Since his stroke, Mr Donahue, who lives in Los Angeles, has lost the use of the right side of his body, including his hand.</p>
      <p>He also has problems with both speech and mobility.</p>
      <p>Luke Hobbs, auctioneer at Gardiner Houlgate in Wiltshire, said: "This guitar has been signed by rock royalty.</p>
      <p>"It's like a Who's Who of the greatest musicians the UK has ever produced."</p>
