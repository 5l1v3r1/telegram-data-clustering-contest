      <p>Is interspecies friendship possible? Why, of course it is and there is plenty of evidence of this in the animal world.</p>
      <p>Look no further than these two little buddies - a kitten and a monkey - that do not mind each other's companionship at all.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, the two seem to get along really well - having fun together like best friends forever.</p>
