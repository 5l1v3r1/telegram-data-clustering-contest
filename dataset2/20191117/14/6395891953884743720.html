      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - U.S. Sen. Jack Reed says a land trust in Rhode Island has been awarded $600,000 in federal funding to help beginning farmers.</p>
      <p>The Rhode Island Democrat says the Southside Community Land Trust won a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant to help beginning farmers access resources and training.</p>
      <p>Reed toured the land trust's 50-acre Urban Edge Farm bordering Cranston and Johnston on Tuesday. It serves as a hub for small-scale, environmentally sustainable commercial agriculture.</p>
      <p>Thirteen farmers operate at Urban Edge. New farmers are invited there to learn how to raise and market crops.</p>
      <p>Reed says the grant helps "plant the seeds for future success."</p>
      <p>The land trust says it has used federal funding to help 27 people begin farming and to train another 79 beginning farmers in the past three years.</p>
