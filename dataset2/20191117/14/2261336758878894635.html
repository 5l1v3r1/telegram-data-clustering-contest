      <p>After a brief retirement, Ross Pearson returned to MMA competition on Saturday night. It didn’t go so well for the long time UFC veteran as he was on the receiving end of a rare highlight reel knockout from Davy Gallon.</p>
      <p>Headlining Probellum in London, Gallon landed a massive rolling thunder kick in the third round that brutally put Pearson out cold. Watch the insane finish below:</p>

      <p>After his 10-year stint with the UFC ended, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/4/9/18301649/ufc-lightweight-veteran-ross-pearson-announces-retirement-mma-news">Pearson announced his retirement from mixed martial arts</a> on April 2019. Like most retirements in combat sports though, it was very brief and temporary. The former TUF 9 Winner returned to competition with <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/5/15/18624538/ufc-mma-boxing-news-australia-ross-pearson-fight-debut">a successful professional boxing debut </a>in May, and eventually came back to MMA with this weekend’s loss.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old’s MMA record now drops to 20-17 with 1 No Contest. He has lost seven of his last eight bouts, dating back to 2016.</p>
      <p>Gallon, on the other hand, notched the biggest win of his career and improved his record to 18-7-2.</p>
