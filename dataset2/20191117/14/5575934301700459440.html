      <p>Two British expatriates living in New Zealand turned a decommissioned ambulance into a tiny home on wheels named “Ivan” so they could bring their dog on trips with them.</p>
      <p>Leanne Edwards, an organizational change consultant, and her husband Dan, a contracts manager, decided to move to New Zealand 20 years ago as tourists and never left the country, travelling around in various rented camper vans. However, the couple hated leaving behind Colin, their miniature schnauzer.</p>
      <p>Colin inspired the Edwards to invest in their own campervan because they hated leaving their dog behind. Dan, a self-taught woodsmith with an electrician’s qualification, completed most of the project, which cost the family a total of about $US48,000.</p>
      <p>The Edwards were looking for campervan inspiration when then stumbled upon <a href="https://quirkycampers.co.nz/">Quirky Campers</a>, a UK-based family business that has rented out handmade, bespoke campers since 2010. The couple decided to open a franchise in New Zealand to allows Kiwis “the chance to hire something outside of the standard factory-fit motorhomes and campervans so ubiquitous in the country,” according to the company’s prepared statement.</p>
      <p>“The Department of Conservation here (in New Zealand) does an awesome job of protecting the most beautiful spots and only making them accessible to those willing to experience them ‘basically,'” Leanne said in a statement. “So this place is made for campers.”</p>
      <p>Ivan is <a href="https://quirkycampers.co.nz/campervan/132713/?">now for rent</a> on the Quirky Campers New Zealand website.</p>
