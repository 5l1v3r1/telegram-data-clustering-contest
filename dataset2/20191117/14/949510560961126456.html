      <p>HP Inc. says its board has rejected a roughly $33.5 billion takeover offer from Xerox.</p>
      <p>The Palo Alto, California-based company said Sunday that the cash and stock deal undervalues its business and its board cited concerns about “outsized” debt levels should the companies combine.</p>
      <p>HP, which makes computers and printers, said it recognizes the potential benefits of consolidation and remains open to exploring other options to combine with Xerox Holdings Corp.</p>
      <p>Both companies have faced difficulties as the demand for printed documents and ink have waned.</p>
