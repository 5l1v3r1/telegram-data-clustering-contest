      <p>BJP MP Gautam Gambhir had drawn a lot of flak for escaping the pollution meet and attending Test match in Indore with missing posters propping up on Sunday around the ITO area in Delhi. The poster reads, "Have you seen him (Gambhir)? He was last seen eating jalebi in Indore. All of Delhi is searching for him." These posters are in relation to Gambhir not attending the meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Urban Development, which had to be postponed as three commissioners of MCD, Vice-Chairman of DDA, Secretary/Joint Secretary of Environment also did not attend. Notably, 25 out of 29 members did not attend the meeting even as air quality deteriorated in the national capital of Delhi.</p>

      <h3>AAP mocks Gambhir</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday posted a cartoon on its Twitter page mocking Gambhir. In the cartoon, a man is seen feeding jalebi to another man representing pollution. The post was captioned saying that there should have been serious talks on Pollution and not on poha and jalebi. AAP has deliberately used a pun on the word "Gambhir" meaning serious, to mock the BJP MP.</p>

      <h3>How did controversy begin?</h3>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, AAP challenged Gautam Gambhir to stop playing the blame game and attend the meetings. It also added that strict action should be taken on all the absentees, claiming it as Contempt of Court. The controversy broke out when former Indian cricketer and commentator VVS Laxman had earlier shared pictures with Gautam Gambhir in which they were seen eating 'pohe and jalebi' during the match.</p>
      <h3>Improvement in Delhi's AQI</h3>
      <p>Finally, on Sunday the people of Delhi got a hint of fresh air while the air quality in the national capital improving after five consecutive days of being in 'Severe' category. The air quality index (AQI) stood at the 'very poor' category during the early hours of Sunday. The overall AQI as of Sunday morning was noted at 365 as opposed to that of 505 on Saturday, according to SAFAR. </p>
