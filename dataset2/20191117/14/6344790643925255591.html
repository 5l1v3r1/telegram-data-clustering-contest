      <p><b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b> is celebrating the fifth year of Fifth Edition and forty-five years since the very first publication in 1974. To celebrate, the company has teamed up with Level Up Dice to create 1,974 sets of some fancy new dice. The <i>D&amp;D</i> Sapphire Anniversary Dice Sets are made of anodized luxury aluminum and one of the two included d20s will feature a lab-grown sapphire. Each set consists of eleven dice consisting of 2d20s, 1d12, 2d10s, 1d8, 4d6s, and 1d4 and will come with a custom dice box and tray combo. In addition, consumers will receive a foldout card with the game stats for adult sapphire dragons, an exclusive sticker sheet with the D&amp;D ampersand, and a collector’s card for authenticity.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in owning a set of these dice, you should know that the are not cheap. One set will cost $299.99. If you’re still not turned off, you can purchase the set on November 21 on the <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/sapphire-anniversary">official site</a>. Talking about creating these dice, <b>Nathan Stewart</b> from Wizards of the Coast said:</p>
      <blockquote>When the D&amp;D team realized the sapphire is the traditional anniversary stone for both five years and forty-five years, and that adding a laboratory-created sapphire to a twenty-sided die wouldn’t jeopardize the integrity of a roll, we couldn’t pass up the chance to make something really cool to celebrate the milestones. The team put together a fun product for our fans that includes art and newly updated stats for sapphire dragons, making these classic dragons ready for play in your next D&amp;D session.</blockquote>
