      <h2>MP asks aboriginal tribals to put up a united front irrespective of party affiliations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:11:36+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Member of Parliament Adilabad (ST) Soyam Bapu Rao of Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday gave a call to Adivasis to attend the proposed Chalo Delhi public meeting at New Delhi on December 9 irrespective of party affiliations.</p>
      <p>The call came during a preparatory meeting for the Delhi event which was attended by aboriginal people from Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad and Nirmal districts under the banner of Adivasi Hakkula Porata Samithi, better known as Tudum Debba.</p>
      <p>The main objective of the Delhi event is to demand expulsion of Lambada tribe from the list of Scheduled Tribes. The MP vowed to meet his political rival from Telangana Rashtra Samithi and former Adilabad MP G. Nagesh to request him to attend the meeting as a measure of making it a united affair of aboriginal tribes in Telangana.</p>
      <p>Notable, however, was the absence of Asifabad MLA Athram Sakku and KB Asifabad Zilla Parishad chairperson Kova Laxmi at the meeting. Many had expected them to attend the preparatory meeting as they too were supporters of the main demand of the Adivasis.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bapu Rao demanded a white paper on land assigned to ethnic people in erstwhile undivided Adilabad district. He also accused the government of giving Local Scheduled Tribe certificates to ineligible Lambadas.</p>
