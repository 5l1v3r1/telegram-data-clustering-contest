      <h1>General Election: Jeremy Corbyn explains Brexit plan for 'close EU relationship'</h1>
      <h2>The Labour leader took the BBC's Andrew Marr through how Labour's plan for Brexit would work</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T14:04:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn said he wants Britain to have a "close relationship" with the EU if he wins the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> - as he explained Labour's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> plan.</p>
      <p>Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if he wants the UK to leave the EU or not, Mr Corbyn said: "We're going to put that choice to the British people, and they will make that decision.</p>
      <p>"We'll negotiate within three months a credible, sensible option of Leave, and put that alongside Remain in a referendum."</p>
      <p>Asked about his own personal view, Mr Corbyn said: "I want a close relationship with the EU in the future.</p>
      <p>"And we will put that decision to the British people, and I will abide by that decision. That's the view we've come to in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Party."</p>

      <p>He added: "A Leave option would mean a trade relationship with Europe, and it would mean protection of rights, and obviously that includes protection of the Good Friday Agreement."</p>
      <p>He added: "My strategy has been to try and bring people together on both sides of the argument, because actually there's a great deal that unites them about the inequalities and injustices in this country."</p>
      <p>Pressed on what his own personal view is on whether or not the UK should leave the EU, Mr Corbyn said: "The answer is, as I've explained to you, that we will negotiate a credible option of leaving, put that alongside Remain, and the British people would make their mind up on that basis, and we will discuss this obviously when we've concluded those initial negotiations which will start immediately we take office."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Pushed again for his own view, he said: "Jeremy Corbyn can say this - that we have to have a close trading relationship with Europe, we won't crash out into the arms of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> , we won't be doing sweetheart trade deals with the USA, and we won't be wrecking our National Health Service in the process as the Prime Minister is planning to do.</p>
      <p>Asked about members of his party campaigning for Remain, regardless of what he negotiates with the EU, he said: "Well you don't know who I'm going to take with me into those negotiations."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said there would be a team of people involved that would be "representative of all parts of the UK and of areas that have different views on it".</p>
      <p>Asked if he would bring pro-Brexit voices in, he said: "There will be Labour voices that would have fought the election on the basis of the agreement we hope to reach with the European Union which we'll put to the people of this country."</p>
