        <b>Suleman Awal, the Cape Coast native who invaded the pitch during the Black Stars versus South Africa AFCON 2021 Qualifier last week, has broken his silence following his release from Police Custody on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was arrested by the police after he disrupted the AFCON qualifier match when ran across the Cape Coast stadium.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to Saddick Adams Sports Obama on Angel 102.9 FM Sports, the Nalerigu Nursing and Midwifery graduate said the Police insisted he had taken weed and tramadol after they arrested him.</p>
      <p>“As I have explained, I went unto the pitch to try and get a selfie with Thomas Partey because he is my idol and I couldn’t hold my feelings seeing him score in front of me”.</p>
      <p>“I initially saw where he was standing before I jumped in but following the chase, I lost sight of him and so started running in circles to escape the security so I could get to see him”.</p>
      <p>“But after they arrested me, the police were forcing to take away my phone and I resisted. Whiles we were in the police van going to the station, they all insisted that I had either take weed (marijuana) or tramadol but I told them I don’t do drugs”.</p>
      <p>“They still didn’t believe so I asked for a blood test because I knew that there was no traces of such drugs in my blood. They all said I do wee or tramadol”.</p>
      <p>Awal became an internet sensation after the act and upon his release from police cells, family and friends took him across town in a pick-up truck to celebrate.</p>
      <p>He however said he initially shot down the idea of parading him through the streets but was coerced by friends to do it</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to be celebrated that way because what I did doesn’t call for celebration. I erred and breached a code. Even my profession doesn’t allow for me to bring disrepute to it so I knew I was wrong”.</p>
      <p>“I apologise to all Ghanaians and the GFA for causing the stoppage and further putting the lives of many at risk. I promise it will never happen again and I don’t encourage anybody to embark on such action”, he assured</p>
