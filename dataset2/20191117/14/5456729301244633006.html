      <p>The 30 missing ad-hoc staff of the electoral commission, INEC, who were reported missing have been found.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES reported how the ad-hoc staff were declared missing around 1 a.m. on Sunday during the final collation of results in Olamaboro local government.</p>
      <p>An INEC spokesperson confirmed Sunday afternoon that they had been found.</p>
      <p>“We can now confirm that all the 30 ad-hoc staff engaged for the 2019 Kogi Governorship election and posted to Polling Units 002, 006 and 013 at Olamaboro III; and Polling Units 006, 012, 015, 016, 022 at Imani 1 all in Olamaboro Local Government Area have been accounted for,” the Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, said in a statement to PREMIUM TIMES.</p>
      <p>“The staff are safe, sound and back in their respective homes”.</p>
      <p>He said the election-day duty staff could not be accounted for initially following the violent attacks by some armed thugs at their respective duty posts after the close of polls.</p>
      <p>He also said the chairman of the INEC, Mahmood Yakubu, has personally spoken with some of them and they confirmed that they are hale and hearty.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that the commission has established that none of them was either injured or killed.</p>
      <p>“They were able to successfully conclude the result collation process before the commotion started</p>
      <p>“The collated election results at Local Government Level are now being announced at the State Collation Centre at the Commission’s State Office in Lokoja,” he said.</p>
