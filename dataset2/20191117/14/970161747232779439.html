      <p>We’ve seen our fair share of novelty sex toys. There was the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/11/can-now-get-sex-toy-hand-sculpted-bobble-head-partner-attached-8881823/">Wobbly Willy</a>, a toy with a realistic-looking bobblehead of your partner attached. Then there was the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/22/you-can-now-have-sex-with-a-drinks-can-thanks-to-a-new-fleshlight-collab-10438278/">energy drink can</a> with a built-in synthetic vagina.</p>
      <p>And how could we ever forget/unsee <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/25/someones-made-bop-themed-sex-toy-7576629/">the Bop It! themed sex toy</a>, a four-pronged contraption inspired by the popular movement-challenge toy?</p>
      <p>Occasionally, some toys look a hell of a lot like sex toys but aren’t intended for erotic use at all. Barkbox’s new ‘<a href="https://barkshop.com/products/big-honkin-pigs-in-a-blanket">Big Honkin’ Pigs In A Blanket</a>’ dog toy is one of these wondrous items.</p>
      <p>The popular American dog toy subscription company recently released the toy in its Thanksgiving box.</p>
      <p>When announcing the swine-themed toy to its 600,000 monthly subscribers, the brand noted it ‘overdid it’ and created an ‘overstuffed toy packed with surprises’. Social media users were quick to point out just how much the company had (inadvertently) overdid it…</p>

      <p>‘Hell no, my dog is not getting a pocket pussy for Christmas,’ wrote one user.</p>
      <p>So yes, the soft toys appear to pay homage to an iconic erotic toy: the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2015/11/27/mum-finds-sex-toy-in-sons-shower-regrets-asking-internet-for-help-5529960/">Fleshlight</a>. Trust the dang web to dirty up an innocent dog toy.</p>

        <figcaption>Barkbox’s new toy has been rightly compared to the Fleshlight (Picture: Fleshlight)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Originally created in 1998 as a discreet device for sperm collection, the Fleshlight has become somewhat of masturbatory must-have for penis-having individuals. It’s essentially a synthetic vagina used by simply placing the penis inside and doing what comes naturally.</p>
      <p>Despite the harrowing comparisons, Barkbox is adopting the ‘any press is good press’ dogma and are having a bit of a laugh.</p>
      <p>The company has responded to customers with comments about how they ‘thought long and hard’ about the design and even released <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@barkbox/video/6756656544655478021">a cheeky TikTok video</a>.</p>
      <p>Barkbox also recently published a blog post titled ‘<a href="https://barkpost.com/so-about-our-big-honkin-pigs-in-a-blanket-toy/">SO About Our “Big Honkin’ Pigs In a Blanket” Toy…</a>’ in which the whole Fleshlight matter is addressed.</p>
      <p>Stacie Grissom, editor of the BarkBox blog, took the chance to recap all the commentary surrounding the toy – screenshots of the furore included! – and concluded that the brand wasn’t aware of the toy’s striking resemblance to Fleshlights.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously we all noticed how… spicy… the Pigs in a Blanket toy is. They’re butts! Butts are hilarious. BUTT– we didn’t know HOW spicy this toy really is.’</p>
      <p>Stacie explained that it’s been a learning experience, particularly in the realm of colour choice.</p>

      <p>‘In the last 24 hours, I think we’ve all learned something about how to make ads fun, be careful with flesh-coloured toys of any design, and that CONFLABBIT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO dog toys just ALWAYS LOOK LIKE DURN SEX TOYS.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/barkbox-pig-toy-fleshlight-sex-toy/?europe=true">According to <i>Mashable</i></a>, the notorious toy sold out in just three hours, meaning sales were 200% higher than normal.</p>
