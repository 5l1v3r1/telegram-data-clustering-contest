        <b>Marine renewable energies, including offshore wind energy, are some of the future priorities for the next Northern Regional Operational Programme, according to its Coordination Commission (CCDR-N)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an interview with Lusa, Ester Gomes da Silva, vice-president of CCDR-N admitted that in the North there are a number of conditions, particularly in terms of winds, which can enhance the use of platforms, which ensure a less polluting and more environmentally friendly use of energy.</p>
      <p>She underlined the need to strengthen the sea cluster in the region, because it is not yet a priority in the North.</p>
      <p>There are also other areas to be considered for the development of the region, such as "nautical tourism".</p>
      <p>Activities related to fisheries or shipbuilding or biotenologies, 'offshore', are some of the areas that Ester Gomes da Silva listed as being "important", both in terms of employment and value creation.</p>
      <p>Investment in the area of marine renewable energies, as well as in protecting ecosystems require "very large investments", she warned.</p>
      <p>"It is important to make a link between good ideas and investment from an academic point of view. We then have to have a business structure that can respond, and for that, we need support from the administration, and also from the structural funds for this purpose".</p>
      <p>The CCDR-N is currently listening to various partners in the areas it considers a priority for the Northern region, including the sea cluster, to design a future programme.</p>
      <p>Ester Gomes da Silva is participating along with Jo√£o Pedro Matos Fernandes, Minister of the Environment, in the Business2sea conference to mark the celebrations of 10 years of the Cluster of the Sea: From activities carried out to the Challenges of the Sea 2030.</p>
