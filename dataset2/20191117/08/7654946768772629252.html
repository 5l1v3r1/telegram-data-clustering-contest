      <p>The mayor is suddenly major.</p>
      <p>Amplifying a recent surge, Pete Buttigieg dominated his rivals <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/11/16/rel4a_ia.pdf">in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely Iowa caucus voters released Saturday.</a></p>
      <p>The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/politics/iowa-poll-cnn-pete-buttigieg/index.html">hit the 25 percent mark</a> – a 16-point climb since September that put him nearly 10 percentage points clear of his main rivals.</p>
      <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren polled at 16 percent with Bernie Sanders right behind at 15 percent, according to the tally.</p>
      <p>While Buttigieg’s numbers have fattened since September, Warren’s polling dropped by six percentage points and Biden dipped by five.</p>
      <p>Sanders has picked up four percentage points since that stretch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/mayor-pete-buttigieg-catapults-ahead-of-dem-field-in-new-iowa-poll/">The latest poll comes on the heels of several other surveys</a> that show Buttigieg abruptly vaulting to the top of the Democratic pack with Iowa voters.</p>
      <p>No other candidates managed to crack double digits, according to the survey.</p>
      <p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar had 6 percent, and a cluster of five candidates limped along with 3 percent.</p>
      <p>Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has not yet declared his candidacy, had 2 percent.</p>
