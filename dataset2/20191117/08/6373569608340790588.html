      <h1>Credit where credit is due, Plymouth Argyle's defence is finally starting to look the part</h1>
      <h2>THE VERDICT: The Pilgrims had to work hard for their 1-0 win away to table-topping Forest Green</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:53:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle's defending has left a lot to be desired for much of this season, culminating in the 4-0 Devon Derby drubbing by Exeter City at the end of October.</p>
      <p>But there are now encouraging signs that <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims</a> can produce the defensive resilience they are going to need, and on a consistent basis, to challenge for League Two promotion.</p>
      <p>Whatever has been said and done by manager Ryan Lowe behind the scenes and on the training ground since the defeat by Exeter has had a positive effect when it has come to his side's defending.</p>
      <p>They have kept clean sheets in both of their matches since then (excluding the EFL Trophy non-event against Chelsea Under-21s, which ended in a 1-0 loss).</p>
      <p>Both have been on the road, and the Pilgrims have had to dig deep to keep out the opposition.</p>
      <p>First, they beat Bolton Wanderers 1-0 in the FA Cup and then they went to League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers and came away with a win by the same scoreline.</p>
      <p>Both are matches that Argyle would not have won in the opening couple of months of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Back then, they were allowing far too many goals from crosses into their penalty area and often they were conceded late in goals too, which cost them a number of points.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the defenders got most of the blame for this, although the saying 'you defend as a team' is very valid.</p>
      <p>At times, Scott Wootton, Niall Canavan and skipper Gary Sawyer all came in for criticism, and deservedly so, and lost their places in the team.</p>
      <p>So, credit where credit is due, that trio have been excellent in the victories over Bolton and Forest Green.</p>
      <p>Wootton, in particular, seems to have rediscovered his confidence which was shot to pieces last term as he and Argyle struggled in League One.</p>

      <p>It is also worth noting that the last two wins have come with Chelsea loan signing Josh Grant in the midfield holding role.</p>
      <p>That has seen the Pilgrims playing with effectively four central defenders in their line-up, giving them an extra edge of steel.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of talk at the start of the season about Argyle passing the ball out from the back and through the thirds, not least from Lowe himself.</p>
      <p>Now, it feels as though the Pilgrims are concentrating more on some of the football fundamentals, such as getting their bodies in the way of crosses and shots.</p>
      <p>Yes, you can play attacking football when you have the ball but, out of possession, you have to be prepared to do the 'dirty side'.</p>
      <p>That includes standing up to the opposition and showing that you are not prepared to be intimidated by them.</p>
      <p>The victory over Forest Green was a case in point. Rovers, under Mark Cooper, have been lauded as one of the most attractive sides to watch in League Two.</p>
      <p>However, in the closing minutes against Argyle, Cooper sent on powerful centre-back Matt Mills to play as an extra striker.</p>
      <p>There was no subtlety to their play then as the ball was repeatedly hit long and high towards the Argyle penalty area.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims had to defend a flurry of late corners, goalmouth scrambles and appeals for a penalty for a challenge on Mills by 'keeper Alex Palmer, but they survived them all.</p>
      <p>It had not been the good, open game of football we had been promised by both managers but, come the final whistle, there were no complaints from Lowe about that.</p>
      <p>It was job done for the Pilgrims and there will have been a great sense of satisfaction among the players, several of them battered and bruised, at the outcome.</p>
      <p>The win was secured by Antoni Sarcevic's fourth goal of the season, which came from a short corner move with Danny Mayor in the 24th minute.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic played the ball to Mayor, received it back and then cut inside into the Forest Green penalty area.</p>
      <p>His eventual shot took a deflection off Rovers' defender Farrend Rawson and the ball flew high into the net past 'keeper Joe Wollacott.</p>
      <p>Argyle needed defensive determination and organisation after that to hold onto their slender lead but they did so and three valuable points were picked up.</p>
