      <p>Bill star Jane Hayward died after being dragged under the wheel of a double-decker bus - while horrified passengers shouted at the driver to stop.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old actress, who had been in a 1988 episode of The Bill as well as several films - including 2018's My Month With Mrs Potter - had been walking down the High Street of Rickmansworth in the afternoon of June 15, 2019, when she was struck by the Arriva bus.</p>
      <p>Her inquest heard this week how "talented" Jane was "looking the wrong way" as she crossed the road at the junction between High Street and Station Road, the <a href="https://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/news/hertfordshire-news/talented-the-bill-actor-died-3533853">Hertfordshire Mercury</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Bus driver Gavyn Young, 38, told the inquest he heard "wasn't too sure what the noise was" as he turned the vehicle around the corner, but noted the woman who had been standing there seconds before was nowhere to be seen.</p>

      <p>One passenger told police officers in the moment leading up to the crash that it looked as if Jane was going to "knock on the bus door" to get on as she was "so close" to the vehicle before it hit her.</p>
      <p>The witness added that Jane was looking at the ground as she approached the junction.</p>
      <p>Another witness who was in a nearby barber shop with his son told officers he saw a woman being knocked over by the bus and "dragged along the road".</p>
      <p>CCTV footage showed Jane temporarily stopping by the road before she continued into the path of the bus.</p>
      <p>It also showed that she seemed to be "looking the wrong way" and not at the bus.</p>

      <p>Forensic collision investigator PC Sean Redman told the court Mr Young potentially didn't see Jane as she stepped off the pavement because of blind spots from the bus door.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem found the actress had died of multiple traumatic injuries .</p>
      <p>Senior Coroner Geoffrey Sullivan said: "Witness evidence from the police on the afternoon of June 15 said Ms Hayward was walking along the pavement on the High Street in Rickmansworth approaching the junction with Station Road.</p>
      <p>"The bus driver was travelling at 5mph at the time which seemed more than appropriate for a large vehicle like a bus.</p>

      <p>"The evidence provided by him states he was driving along the High Street when the lights at the junction turned green and the bus drove wide in order to negotiate the turn.</p>
      <p>"He saw a female waiting. She was standing stationary at the lights which turned green and he completed the maneuver. He then heard a loud thump and was made aware by passengers who immediately called for him to stop.</p>
      <p>"He immediately got off the bus and found Ms Hayward underneath."</p>
      <p>Mr Sullivan recorded Jane's death as death by road traffic collision.</p>
      <p>The actress had starred in a short film called Collection shortly before her death, and the distributer Relic Films paid tribute to her on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>

      <p>"We are deeply saddened to hear that one our our wonderfully talented actresses, Jane Hayward, has tragically passed away," the company wrote.</p>
      <p>"We were lucky to find Jane for our most recent short film: Collection. She was a huge fan of the script and brought so much to the role and was a wonderful personality on set.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, we did not complete the film in time for her to see if but we hope that she would be proud of it. Rest in Peace Jane x."</p>
      <p>Jane's family also paid tribute to the actress, saying: "We want to give thanks to the emergency services, to all those affected and involved and to the local community for all the support they have given us."</p>
