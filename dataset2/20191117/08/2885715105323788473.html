      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> Students’ Union (JNUSU) will take out a march to Parliament on Monday to protest against the hostel fee hike. The JNUSU said it will be a march to save public education and appeal to MPs to take up the cause. The winter session of Parliament will begin on November 18 and end on December 13.</p>
      <p>Students are protesting inside the administration block of the university against the increase in hostel fee, even though JNU announced a rollback in the hike on Wednesday evening. The students have dubbed the partial rollback as an “eyewash”.</p>
