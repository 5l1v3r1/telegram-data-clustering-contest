      <h2>This is the story of two women who have dramatically changed the lives of young mums in Bristol</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Maggs</a></address>
      <p>Homelessness, treated as an outsider and being told 'you're scum' are just some of the things George Campbell-Touray and Jan Ross faced growing up.</p>
      <p>They were both teenage mothers in Bristol in the 1970s, an era when this was still taboo.</p>
      <p>They were kicked out of their family homes, essentially making them homeless.</p>
      <p>But the two best friends have since gone on to defy those cruel insults, and become important people on the Hillfields estate, saving the one community hub that was at risk of closing.</p>
      <p>After a lifetime of social isolation and living in the stigma caused by being a young single mum, George and Jan decided to help others like them.</p>
      <p>George trained as a social worker and Jan qualified as a nurse before ultimately becoming a therapist and, in 2003, they set up the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/life-hillfields-oldest-council-estate-3168335">Hillfields</a> Young Mums group together.</p>
      <p>They walked away from their jobs and teamed up, creating an organisation offering a valuable service to young mums.</p>
      <p>George said: “I saw the injustices they were going through, like we did. A group of women that were just sick and tired of being ignored, of being tarnished. We decided that maybe we were now in a position to help them.”</p>
      <p>Jan said: “I understood the negative judgement teenage mums get, the looks of disapproval. I understood the very real struggle it is just getting by day to day.</p>
      <p>“So I wanted to try and address that in a very direct way. I brought together what I learnt in nursing, with what I always innately knew, which was how to get the best out of these women. Because in my heart I was still one of them.".</p>
      <p>Jan and George have worked with hundreds of young <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/mums-breastfeeding-bristol-landmarks-campaign-3118505">mums</a> in the area in the past 15 years and now they've been granted <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/houses-planned-built-young-mums-3386652">permission to build houses in their community for young mums</a>.</p>
      <h3>'I was sleeping on the floor in a factory I was working in'</h3>
      <p>Jan said she found out she was pregnant after feeling sick in school. She told Bristol Live: “I can remember throwing up in assembly at school vividly, not knowing why, or understanding morning sickness.</p>
      <p>"Then I hid it for a while. All I felt was the shame and disapproval of my family and people around me. Complete scorn,” she added.</p>
      <p>Both George and Jan left school with no qualifications, and were kicked out of their family homes.</p>
      <p>Jan stayed with another relative while George had to sleep rough - a horrific thing to have to do at any time, let alone while pregnant, frightened and uncertain of the future.</p>
      <p>George said: "I felt very vulnerable, I felt a complete lack of protection. I slept where I could, often sofa surfing, and staying in strangers houses.</p>
      <p>"Then at one point I was sleeping on the floor in a factory I was working in. Being hidden out the back, and living in constant fear of being caught by the manager. To be honest I felt utterly powerless, I had no hope, and lived in constant uncertainty."</p>
      <p>Life was as equally frightening for Jan, who had been living in Local Authority Care.</p>
      <p>When she got pregnant, she was told to leave and literally had nowhere to go - getting married was her only way out.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was very scary, I felt lost. Everything felt so temporay. I got married when I was four months pregnant, and the only place which would have us was a friends farm in Norfolk, so I had to leave all my family and friends behind to go to the other side of the country. I felt lonely and isolated.</p>

      <p>"We were put up in a caravan there eventually, with no electricity. It was a terrible situation."</p>
      <p>After several months of hardship both of the women were eventually given homes by Bristol City Council in Hillfields, a place they have remained to this day.</p>
      <p>Jan said: “I cannot tell you the deep joy I felt about getting my council house. It changed both our lives. We now had a home for life.</p>
      <p>“This enabled both of us to start raising a family, but also to build the very foundations for our work, and where we find ourselves today."</p>
      <h3>'Neighbours would stop and stare'</h3>
      <p>Both of the women spoke of feeling worthless in an era where young mothers were often seen in a negative light.</p>
      <p>Jan said: "I could feel the judgement of others.</p>
      <p>"I remember my wedding day being particularly joyless, there was no music, no singing, no flowers. It was very clinical and cold.</p>
      <p>"Then many people, including in my own family, tried to push me to have an abortion, a termination. It was horrible. I distinctly recall my father say to my new husband after the wedding, 'she's your problem now'."</p>
      <p>People on the estate were equally judgemental, and Jan said: "Neighbours would stop and stare, looking me up and down. The attitude that I slept around and was too young for that. To make things worse even though I was 15, I looked about 12 years old," she added.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>It was similar for George. She said: "There was a view that you were promiscuous. The media called young mums 'gym slip girls' back then. I overheard comments from people saying 'no surprise she got knocked up'. </p>
      <p>"I used to hang around with older lads, so they thought they saw it coming. So I carried a nice big bag of toxic shame around with me for years. So bad that I hid the identity of the father for a long time."</p>
      <p>But as Jan and George got older, their confidence grew and they both went to university, becoming the first people in their families to do so.</p>
      <p>George said: “I did it to partly to prove to people I wasn’t thick, I wasn’t stupid. Everyone said I was growing up, just because I spoke a certain way, and acted in a way they thought meant I was. That was a big motivation.”</p>
      <p>As adults they found there were still a number of challenges mums on the estate experienced, things they wanted to change.</p>
      <p>One was helping mums navigate the system, a system they say was full of people who often lacked real understanding.</p>
      <p>George said: “Back then social services was a very middle class world, and lots of people who worked in the system didn't understand the reality of people’s lives. People that lived in places like Hillfields. They didn't come from these areas.</p>
      <p>“I would find myself advocating on behalf of young mums a lot, having to battle services that were designed to help them but locked many of them out.</p>
      <p>“The mums saw me as one of them. I had a different relationship, a more trusting one," she added.</p>

        <figcaption>Jan Ross and George Campbell-Touray, have taken over the old Hillfields Youth Centre. They are planning to get houses for young mums built on the surrounding grounds of the site.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The duo say some professionals and funding bodies didn't always understand what the Young Mums group did.</p>
      <p>Jan said: "We were interested in the overall wellbeing of the mums. Their social, emotional, psychological, sexual, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/time-out-right-coolest-place-3343608">cultural</a> and educational development.</p>
      <p>“A lot of services just wanted to move people from A to B back then. One head of an organisation literally said to us ‘why would we fund and pay money for people to sit around and drink tea and eat biscuits all day.”</p>
      <p>The group offered a space for mums to be themselves and receive advice and support at their own pace, in an informal setting.</p>
      <p>Jan said: “We have loads of people going on to do well, many that came in with real needs. We have had mums going on to management positions, teacher training, one became a nurse, and a few set up their own businesses.</p>
      <p>“But for many, often being able to leave a damaging relationship or situation is a real success. Seeing them just living independent lives, being happy, can often be a massive step from how it was when they came to see us at first.”</p>

      <p>Domestic violence is something both Jan and George have supported young mums with regularly, being a friendly voice at the end of the phone at all hours.</p>
      <p>The Young Mums group used the Hillfields Youth Centre as its base for years, until <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> put youth services out to tender in 2014 and it was under threat of closure.</p>
      <p>Jan and George then took over running the centre temporarily before eventually applying to take it on completely.</p>
      <p>Eventually they merged with Hillfields Community Trust to become the to Hillfields Family and Community Trust, meaning their work incorporated all ages and all of the community.</p>
      <p>George said: “This is the only place where people can come really. There is no pub in Hillfields, there isn't a central space. It hasn’t benefited from regeneration money like elsewhere, so it was crucial that this stayed open and was expanded on.”</p>
      <p>Jan said: “Now we are fully independent for the first time. We have our own building, our own space, and aren't beholden to anyone.</p>
      <p>“We are managed by the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/people">community</a> for the community, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. And while our work is now broader, the young mums are still central to what we do and several sit on our board guiding the direction of everything we do,” she added.</p>
      <p>Jan and George have now plan to build houses around the community hub for young mums, in a project funded by Homes England.</p>
      <p>George said: “It’s largely Jan’s baby this one, but it’s a brilliant idea. And we have been encouraged by Homes England to go for it and are currently in the pre-development phase.</p>
      <p>“We are passionate and determined to see this through. But looking back from where we came and all we coped with, I just wouldn't believe it was possible.</p>
      <p>“I didn't have the confidence then. But we both do now, and to get this done would feel like we could finally rest, knowing the future is rosy."</p>

      <p>They are now a long way from the two lost, rejected and isolated teenage mums, who people said would never amount to anything.</p>
      <p>Jan said: “If I could go back and talk to the 15-year-old me, the one in local authority care. I would say to her that she’s actually important. Very important.</p>
      <p>“That she’s a very wise young woman, I just didn’t know it at the time. In fact looking back I think she probably knew exactly what she needed. My daughter was the best thing that ever happened to me, and she wanted safety, a home, a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/people">family</a>, a place of love.</p>
      <p>“And everything I have done stems from her, absolutely everything.”<br/> </p>
