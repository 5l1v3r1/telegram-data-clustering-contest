      <h2>Arsenal are now at risk of losing Hector Bellerin, and if that comes to pass, then Unai Emery has truly lost the entire plot of his managing.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:00:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>There is a clear divide among players at <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a>. Not like an internal conflict or anything, but a divide between mindsets. There are the players who are clearly on the out, mostly senior players, and will probably be gone sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>Some of these players have been at the club for awhile, some are relatively new, but they have reached a high enough status in their own individual play that that they don’t want to wait around for anything. I’m thinking <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d5dd5f1f/Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>, mostly.</p>
      <p>Then there are the young stars. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/5ea8ef20/Matteo-Guendouzi?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Matteo Guendouzi</a> and Gabriel Martinelli for instance. Guys who, while new, seem to buy into the state of the club 100%, never saying anything out of place and never expressing any discontent. And rarely does a young player speak out in such circumstances, but still, it’s reassuring.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/f874dd44/Hector-Bellerin?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Hector Bellerin</a> falls in between the two camps. He’s experienced, has been at the club a long time, and there’s no reason why there should be any talk of him leaving. Not just because of what he provides on the pitch, but because he is just a fountain of positivity.</p>
      <p>He is always speaking highly of the club, of uniting and standing together, and all the things that you just don’t hear often enough.</p>
      <p>As such, the rumors of his potential exit are disturbing. Bellerin is everything Unai Emery would want in a senior player, not least of all the fact that he isn’t even really a senior player. He’s only 24-years-old and as such, has another decade to give the club, if we’d have him (and if he’d have us, though I feel like he would).</p>
      <p><a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/dc6f5bdd/Calum-Chambers?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Calum Chambers</a> is another such player. Always positive. Always fighting. And incredibly deserving of being a senior player after the inevitable turnover.</p>
      <p>That’s the thing though, if you lose these guys as well, what’s the point? You can’t buy veteran leadership like Emery tried with <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/c0e27d1a/David-Luiz?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">David Luiz</a>. You earn it. Bellerin and Chambers have earned it, they are ready to be considered in the senior leadership of the club and it would be a complete catastrophe to lose either one of them, let alone both.</p>
      <p>This is a big test for the Gunners, and I hope they can pass. There’s been too much failure lately.</p>
