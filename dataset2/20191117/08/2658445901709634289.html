      <p>The Commission declared them missing at about 1 am on Sunday when the Electoral Officer for the Local Government Garba Mahmood was presenting results of the election in the local government.</p>
      <p>The missing staffs include Presiding Officers (POs) and Assistant Presiding Officers (APOs) of polling units in Imane ward 1 and 2 of Olamaboro LGA of Kogi State.</p>

      <p>Results from the polling units in the two wards were also not available to be included in the final collated results for the local government.</p>
      <p>Mahmood said the INEC ad-hoc staffs were reported missing after the observation of some police officers who raised concerns that they were last seen shortly after voting ended at about 2 pm on Saturday, adding that attempt to contact them on phone failed.</p>
      <p>The police spokesperson in Kogi, William Aya, could also not be reached on the status of the missing persons.</p>
      <p>Olamoboro is one of the local government areas in Kogi East Seenatorial District.</p>
