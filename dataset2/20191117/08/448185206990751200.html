      <p><b>Sabarimala:</b> The Kerala police on Saturday did not allow three women, who were part of a group, to go to the Sabarimala temple to pray after checking the identity cards of the women. The temple tradition disallows women in the age group of 10 to 50 years to enter the temple precinct. The two-month-long Sabarimala temple festival officially opens for pilgrims on Sunday at 5 a.m. However, it opens today at 5 p.m. for religious rituals to be performed by the temple priest and ‘tantris.’ The three women who were barred toady came from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. They were part of a group of pilgrims who were stopped for checking by the police at Pamba base camp. Sources said the three women were separated from the group as the police suspected them to be in the age group of 10-50 years.  (IANS)</p>
