      <p>Bollywood couple Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh celebrated their first wedding anniversary on Thursday, and the spirit of mush seems to have rubbed off on some of their fans, too.</p>
      <p>During their visit to the Tirumala Tirupati Temple in Chittoor to seek the blessings of Lord Venkateswara on their special day, the couple encountered a rather amusing situation involving a fan.</p>

      <p>A video posted on Instagram shows that, as Ranveer and Deepika arrived at the temple, a crazed fan couldn’t curb excitement.</p>
      <p>“I love you,” he told Deepika first, which the actress acknowledged with a smile. The fan then addressed Ranveer and said: “I love you Bhaiyya.”</p>
      <p>Deepika, sporting as ever, had a witty retort in place.</p>
      <p>“But you love me more!” she quipped to the fan, and the actor-couple broke into laughter.</p>
      <p>While the couple visited the Tirumala temple on November 14, they were at the Golden Temple in Amritsar the next day, to seek divine blessings.</p>
      <p>Deepika and Ranveer will be seen together next on screen in Kabir Khan’s “83”, which accounts the inspiring story of India’s first-ever World Cup win in cricket in 1983. Ranveer plays Kapil Dev, who led the team to the famous victory, while Deepika essays Kapil’s wife Romi.</p>
