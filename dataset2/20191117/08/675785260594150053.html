      <h1>Ashes star James Pattinson suspended for using 'homophobic slur' at opposition player</h1>
      <h2>Fast bowler James Pattinson was expected to play against Pakistan this week but has now been axed for the alleged slur at Cameron Gannon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:35:11+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Wilson, https://www.facebook.com/DeanWilsonCricketMirror/</a></address>
      <p>Australia fast bowler James Pattinson has been suspended following his abuse of another player with a reportedly 'homophobic slur.'</p>
      <p>Ashes bowler Pattinson was expected to play in the first Test against Pakistan at the Gabba this week but has now been hooked from the squad after his run in with Queensland player Cameron Gannon for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield.</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia have not confirmed precisely what Pattinson said to Gannon, a former team-mate, however <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/cricket/james-pattinson-charged-over-alleged-sheffield-shield-slur/news-story/63a7d723cd5b0224e809137b79478ef0">The Australian reports</a> it as a 'homophobic slur'.</p>
      <p>And it was serious enough to warrant a level two charge for “Using language or gesture(s) that is seriously obscene, seriously offensive or of a seriously insulting nature.”</p>

      <p>Pattinson immediately apologised for the outburst but that was not enough to prevent the umpires from charging him and, with two previous offences for other more minor incidents hanging over him, it lead to his suspension.</p>
      <p>“I made a mistake in the heat of the moment,” Pattinson said. “Straight away I realised I was in the wrong, and I apologised immediately, both to the opponent and to the umpires.</p>
      <p>“I have done the wrong thing and accept the penalty. I’m gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine.”</p>

      <p>Pattinson, 29, made his Test debut in 2011 and has been in and out of the Australia side since then.</p>
      <p>He was back in the fold for the Ashes this summer after a three-and-a-half year absence.</p>
      <p>He played in two of the five Tests as Australia retained the Ashes.</p>
