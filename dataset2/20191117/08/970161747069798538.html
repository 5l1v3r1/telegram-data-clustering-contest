      <p>After a year away from I’m A Celebrity, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> has opened up on reuniting with his best mate Declan Donnelly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/caitlyn-jenner-ian-wright-im-a-celebrity-2019-11073780/">for the 2019 series.</a></p>
      <p>As it<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/"> prepares to launch this evening</a>, the lads are back in front of the cameras – after Holly Willoughby stepped in for Ant in 2018.</p>
      <p>It<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/16/ant-mcpartlin-fined-86000-drink-driving-judge-says-lost-good-character-7471919/"> followed a troubled year</a> for the 43-year-old presenter, who stepped back from the limelight following a drink driving conviction and prescriptions drugs battle.</p>
      <p>But now he’s back to his best and ready to head to the Australian jungle and have a giggle at some celebrities for another year.</p>
      <p>‘I’m very, very excited about getting back on the show,’ <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10360802/im-a-celeb-ant-dec-questions/">he told The Sun</a> this weekend. ‘It’s a brilliant place to work and a brilliant part of the world to be in.</p>

      <p>One, two, three…aww.</p>
      <p>This year <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/im-celebrity-2019-line-start-11070107/">sees the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Nadine Coyle, and Ian Wright</a> all battle it out for the title of King or Queen of the Jungle, and Dec, 44, went on to dub them as ‘one of the best casts in years’.</p>
      <p>When asked what they’re most looking forward to about this series, Dec said: ‘The cast. We’ve been privy to a few of the names taking part this year. We’re very, very excited as it’s one of the best casts in years.</p>

      <p>‘It’s a time of year we really look forward to and we love being in Australia. This will be our 19th series and it’s a show we absolutely love doing.’</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec also looked back on the history of the show, and said they have ‘the utmost respect’ for the stars who take part in the programme, because it takes a lot of guts to face their fears.</p>
      <p>Which is why they don’t really take the mick (well, too much) out of them, as they know they’ll be seeing them at the wrap party once it’s all over and the grubs have long been brushed from their breeches.</p>
      <p>Ant said: ‘We know them throughout the years. We see them after and we’re always very polite to them when we see them.</p>

      <p>‘We have a rule that we don’t take the mick so much, as we know we’re going to meet them at the wrap party.’</p>
      <p>Dec rightly added ‘it’s not easy’ to put yourself in the position these celebrities do, and the TV presenting stalwarts ‘take their hats off’ to the cast.</p>
