      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kodak-black">Kodak Black</a> faces the possibility of up to 60 additional years in federal prison after being hit with two more felony gun charges.</p>
      <p>The news arrives only a few days after the rapper <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kodak-black-has-been-sentenced-to-46-months-on-federal-weapons-charges-2567709">received a a 46-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to federal weapons charges</a> on Wednesday (November 13). The maximum sentence he could have received for those charges was 10 years.</p>
      <p>Kodak was found guilty of lying while trying to purchase firearms on two separate occasions, indicating on paperwork “that he was not under indictment or information in any court for a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could imprison him for more than one year,” the <i><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237288659.html">Miami Herald</a></i> reported this week.</p>

      <p>Kodak Black faces up to 60 additional years in prison</p>
      <p>Yesterday (November 16) the <i>Herald</i> confirmed that Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office has <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237408344.html">handed the ‘Zeze’ rapper two new felony counts</a> for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. One charge stems from a gun purchased in January, while the other is linked to a gun found on him when he was arrested in Miami in May. As Kodak has been labeled a “habitual offender,” he could face up to 30 full years for each count.</p>
      <p>Kodak’s lawyer Bradford Cohen addressed the new charges in a statement to XXL. “This is what happens when the government feels like they lost when a young man [gets] 46 months on a filing a false document.</p>
      <p>“Miami has charged him with the purchase of the weapons, because of a little rarely known law if you had a juvenile prior you can’t possess a weapon until you are 24. The Miami case will be dealt with very soon.”</p>
      <p>Black remains in federal custody. He is also <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kodak-black-storms-out-interview-sexual-assault-2420433">still facing trial in South Carolina on allegations he raped a high school student in South Carolina</a>.</p>
