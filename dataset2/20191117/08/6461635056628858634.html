      <h3>Luis Suarez himself knows that his time at FC Barcelona is close to an end.</h3>
      <p>No doubt, he has been a great player for the club over the years and he himself knows that the time has come for the club to replace him. As per <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/tnt-luis-suarez-could-sign-for-boca-juniors-7737006"><b>Sport</b></a>, two clubs are looking to ready land Barcelona striker Luis Suarez. These clubs are based in Argentina.</p>
      <p>It’s no secret that Luis himself admitted that he’d like to play in Uruguay in the fag end of his career but Boca Juniors and San Lorenzo are looking to tweak with his plans. For Boca Juniors, his addition would be phenomenal for them but that ultimately depends on who wins the club elections.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan is aware of the fact that the Blaugranes have started to look at some fresh options to replace Suarez who has become oddly slow and inconsistent off late.</p>
      <p>San Lorenzo could be a possible destination for the 32 year-old as he holds good terms with the Club’s vice-president. The forward was given a club shirt and membership not so long ago.<br/>Suarez however hasn’t ruled out the possibility of playing in Uruguay as he has always mentioned Uruguay as his second home.</p>
      <p>No doubt that Suarez’s departure is going to leave a huge void in the Club and it will be up to Valverde to fill up the position with someone who is as good as Suarez, if not better.</p>
      <p>However, the harsh truth remains that the arrival of Griezmann and his age has meant that he doesn’t have much time left at the Camp Nou. Suarez has fulfilled his role at the club very well and it remains to be seen if the striker is ready to leave the game at the highest level.</p>
