      <p>BLUFFTON, S.C. (AP) — Billionaire Tom Steyer is digging deep into his personal fortune to rewrite the rules of presidential politics.</p>
      <p>In just four months, the hedge fund manager-turned-liberal activist has assembled a sprawling national staff that now exceeds 300. He has paid operatives on the ground in at least five Super Tuesday states. And he’s blanketing the airwaves with an advertising campaign that’s dwarfing his opponents’ best efforts.</p>
      <p>Still, he’s struggling to break out of the pack. And soon, he may not be the only billionaire in the race.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Associated Press, Steyer says he’s prepared to spend more than the $100 million he initially pledged toward his presidential ambitions if necessary.</p>
      <p>What would he say to people who think he’s trying to buy the presidency?</p>
      <p>“I don’t think that’s possible,” he tells the AP.</p>
