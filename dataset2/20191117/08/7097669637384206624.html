      <h1>75 Years Ago the USS Grayback Was Lost in the Pacific Ocean: This is the Doomed Submarine’s Epic Story.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p>On February 27, 1944, a Japanese Nakajima B5N torpedo bomber patrolling over the East China Sea near Okinawa spotted the glinting hull of a submarine surfaced above the water.</p>
      <p>Earlier that very day, the freighter <i>Celyon Maru </i>had been sunk by two torpedoes.</p>
      <p>The three-man bomber swooped down and reported a direct hit with a 500-pound, causing the submarine to “explode and sink immediately.”</p>
      <p>To play it safe, Japanese warships closed in on a trail of bubbles left at the scene and laced the ocean with depth charges. As concussive blasts wracked the water, a black oil slick surged to the surface.</p>
      <p>Ten days later, on March 7, the submarine <i>USS Grayback</i> failed to return to Pearl Harbor from her tenth war patrol as scheduled. Nor did she reply to a radio inquiry three days later.</p>
      <p>After waiting three weeks, the Navy listed <i>Grayback </i>and the<a href="http://www.oneternalpatrol.com/uss-grayback-208.htm"> eighty sailors aboard her</a> as “missing, presumed lost with all hands.”</p>
      <p>After the Japanese surrender, researchers correlated <i>Grayback</i>’s disappearance with Japanese records. They concluded 1,652-ton submarine had been on something of a rampage before meeting her last patrol, possibly sinking as many as four ships totaling 21,000 tons.</p>

        <b>Found at Last</b>
      </p>
      <p>Seventy-five years later, a privately funded expedition set out to find <i>Grayback</i>’s lost wreck. Team leader Tim Taylor and partner Christina Dennison had previously located the wrecks of four other U.S. World War II submarines as part of a project called Lost 52, leveraging new autonomous underwater vehicle technology that could search wide areas without having to be continuously tethered to a boat. </p>
      <p>Two years earlier, I chatted with Taylor and Dennison about their first find in 2010: Navy coastal defense submarine <i>R-12</i>, which sank mysteriously off the coast of Florida, taking with her forty-three crew. They expressed their wish to preserve the memory of the heroic submariners who sacrificed their lives in the conflict and give relatives a sense of closure by identifying the sites of their remains.</p>
