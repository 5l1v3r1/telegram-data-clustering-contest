        <b>A group hoping to bring a disused Suffolk pub is hoping for a final push on its fundraising efforts this weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Villagers in Little Bealings are hoping to buy the The Admiral's Head pub, which last opened its doors in 2012.</p>
      <p>The building has remained empty ever since and has since been listed as an asset of community value.</p>
      <p>The pub went up for sale in May with the community being given the six months to put a bid together to take over the Admirals Head.</p>
      <p>Last month, a group, known as the Friends of the Admirals Head, launched a fundraising campaign to buy the disused pub back for the community by offering shares for the community to buy.</p>
      <p>Since its initial launch the group has raised £70,000 with pledges of money having come from all over the county.</p>
      <p>With only days left of the fundraising campaign the group are hoping to push past the £100,000 mark before the weekend is out.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Friends of the Admirals Head group said: "We're really encouraged to have received support from more than 100 people pledging over £70,000 in the past month.</p>
      <p>"We've had pledges not just from the villages around the pub, but also from Woodbridge, Kesgrave, Martlesham and further afield in Felixstowe and Ipswich.</p>
      <p>"We are hopeful that we can push this up to £100,000 in time for when we submit our bid on the 23rd of November. This is a chance to become a part-owner of a community pub in the heart of the beautiful Fynn Valley.</p>
      <p>"We're also thrilled to have received support from parishes who are backing our bid to buy, refurbish and reopen the pub."</p>
      <p>Those interested in backing the pub have until Sunday to submit their pledges and can do so through the group's website.</p>
