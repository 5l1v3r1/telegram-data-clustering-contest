      <h3>Sunday</h3>
      <p><b>DOLPHINS (+6½) over Bills:</b> We’re handed projections of highs in the mid-70s in South Florida on Sunday, and we’re supposed to even consider the Bills ATS, given the sustained ascending form of home side QB Ryan Fitzpatrick? Not on your life. Seasonal Miami offensive averages underrate potentials, given current realities.<br/><b><br/>Jets (+1¹/₂) over REDSKINS:</b> Even with Gang Green fresh off a put-it-on-the-line win over the Giants at MetLife, looking for more, with the visitors enjoying a meaningful skill-position edge (Le’Veon Bell, et al) over the ’Skins exceedingly-raw QB project Dwayne Haskins and his low-scoring cohorts.</p>
      <p><b>Cowboys (-4½) over LIONS:</b> With the New Jersey spread lay price on Dallas soaring this week with unavailability of QB Matthew Stafford and other key Lions operatives who’ve long manned vital skill positions for the hosts, it’s up to Dallas to play to potential.<br/><b><br/>Saints (-5½) over BUCCANEERS: </b>Coin toss at the number in what looms as a track meet, as the Saints look to bounce back with vigor after a bizarre SuperDome no-show against Atlanta. The Bucs reflect long history of ATS underperformance at home.<br/><b><br/>PANTHERS (-5) over Falcons:</b> It’s back-to-normal time for two NFC Southies. The Falcons somehow resurrected a top-drawer pass rush against Drew Brees, the key to their spectacular upset. Dare ’em to do it again — against Panthers spitting blood after Green Bay mugging. Body of evidence suggests Carolina gives Falcons blues with efficient ground game.</p>

      <p><b>Jaguars (+3) over COLTS:</b> The Jags are by no stretch a title-contending outfit — but every dog has its days, and conditions suit this underdog. Colts QB Jacoby Brisset is expected to start for visitors if his iffy knee holds up in midweek drills — though he will be without wideout T.Y. Hilton. Nick Foles will be back under center for the Jags, and the Super Bowl-winning QB appears advantageous option here.</p>
      <p><b>VIKINGS (-10½) over Broncos:</b> Minnesota returns home after splitting road crusades vs. the Chiefs and Cowboys, and you couldn’t be shocked if they put it in cruise control for some portion of this — but the Broncos haven’t cracked the 20-point threshold on the road all season. Mike Zimmer coaches cozy with a lead and doesn’t take unnecessary chances.<br/><b><br/>Texans (+4) over RAVENS:</b> As befits a side that went out of its way to take significant roster-building shots at seasonal glory in ’19, Houston has played to better advantage on the road than usual. The Ravens have scored 116 points in their past three outings, having just hung 49 on the Bungles. Don’t expect it’ll come nearly so easily for these hosts this week.</p>
      <p><b>49ERS (-10½) over Cardinals: </b>Due to an improved running game, The Cards have shown to better advantage this season. Prior to its narrow loss at Tampa Bay, Arizona finished resolutely to wind up within a field goal of San Francisco at home — though it appeared the favored Niners had the situation in hand. Expect a better defensive effort from hosts in this jiffy-quick rematch.</p>
      <p><b>Patriots (-3½) over EAGLES: </b>This opened with the Pats as sliver-thin favorites, but filled out to prevailing levels when this week’s trading began. Given the defending champs’ redoubtable record in revenge roles — especially off losses — it’s understandable. Hosts shouldn’t be intimidated, but compelled to look this way, given who won Super Bowl LII.</p>
      <p><b>RAIDERS (-10½) over Bengals:</b> As a double-digit favorite, Oakland faces an alteration in their competitive role — as a favorite of more than a field goal for the first time this season. Don’t expect a high-scoring, grotesque blowout, but unsure what Bengals QB Ryan Finley can get done at this level.<br/><b><br/>RAMS (-6¹/₂) over Bears:</b> Chicago was meaningfully aided in the meeting of these two last December at home, when Jared Goff’s Rams understandably encountered difficulties coping successfully with sub-freezing temps after dark. Don’t expect voluminous scoring from either side.</p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p><b>Chargers (+3½) over Chiefs (at Mexico City):</b> With RB Melvin Gordon continuing to work a solid groove for the Bolts since his return to sustained action, and with KC having trouble finishing off drives with any consistency, will look to beyond-desperate Chargers to keep things close at altitude on this neutral site. Favorite hasn’t put any foe away by open daylight in more than two months.</p>
      <p><b>Last Wee:</b> 8-3-1.<br/><b>Season: </b>74-60-2.</p>
