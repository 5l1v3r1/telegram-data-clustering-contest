      <p>BEIRUT, LEBANON (10:15 A.M.) – The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) launched a new attack in the northeastern countryside of the Latakia Governorate today, as their troops targeted the mountain and hilltops south of Kabani.</p>

      <p>The main issue at hand, however, is that this area is heavily fortified and well-defended by the jihadist rebels of Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) and the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP).</p>
      <p>The last time the Syrian Army attempted to advance in this area north of the Zuwayqat Mountains, they suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the jihadist rebels.</p>
      <p>In the coming hours, the Syrian Army will either succeed in crossing into this area or they will be forced to ultimately retreat once the jihadist rebels launch a counter-offensive.</p>
