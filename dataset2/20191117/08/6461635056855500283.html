      <h3>Umtiti situation at Barcelona has taken yet another turn in the favour of him leaving the club to PSG. As per reports from the <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/calciomercato-psg-interested-in-samuel-umtiti-7737012"><b>Sport</b></a>, PSG are interested in snapping up the French defender.</h3>
      <p>Samuel Umtiti has struggled with knee injury problems for more than a year now and so much so that he has started twice only for Barcelona in the past year. Umtiti’s problems started when he decided to play the World Cup last year with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Since the World Cup, Umtiti has had recurrent problems with his knee and consequently, he has fallen down the pecking order with Ernesto Valverde not preferring him anymore. Hence it is evident that either of the parties involved aren’t getting anything fruitful from each other.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Paris Saint-Germain’s sporting director Leonardo is in favor of landing the Frenchman as there lies his personal interest. Moreover, with the former Lyon defender not getting enough game-time and not enough preference, Umtiti would like to move out and his most preferred destination is going to be his home.</p>
      <p>Umtiti was a key feature in all of the Catalans’ squads before the World Cup. However, his recurrent knee problems have kept him out for long and it is evident that his confidence has taken a hit. The France international’s contract runs out in 2023 but with the Parisians could initiate talks with the defender.</p>
      <p>The Blaugrana need to let go of Umtiti as his injury problems and dented morale aren’t doing any good to anyone. With the major squad overhaul in mind, Barcelona should look to focus on some other bright prospects and in order to gather some funds, they need to let go of Umtiti.</p>
