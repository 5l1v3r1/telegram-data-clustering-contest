      <h1>Exclusive: Pressure on Bristol City as Premier League clubs circle Josh Brownhill</h1>
      <h2>Robins captain is a wanted man</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:25:37+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:25</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor, James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City are under pressure to agree a new contract with on-field club captain Josh Brownhill.</p>
      <p>The dynamic box-to-box midfielder has arguably been the Robins' player of the season after match-winning goals against Charlton Athletic and Cardiff City in recent weeks but that has only further alerted suitors in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><i>Bristol Live</i> understands that several clubs in England's top division would like to sign the 23-year-old in the January transfer window but that Brownhill is desperate to achieve promotion with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> this season.</p>
      <p>However, Lee Johnson and CEO Mark Ashton must agree a new deal in the near future or possibly face losing the player next summer.</p>

      <p>Sheffield United were leading the chase for the central midfielder in the summer, while Leicester City were linked with the former Preston man a year ago. Brighton have watched the player of late too.</p>
      <p>The Robins must tie up their most consistent player this season or face the prospect of losing the midfielder next summer.</p>
      <p>Brownhill is a big fan of Lee Johnson, and vice-versa, with pals Callum O'Dowda and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/lee-johnson-rewarded-taylor-moore-3220857">Taylor Moore</a> having agreed new terms with City in recent months - and attention within BS3 now turns to Brownhill, who last signed a deal at the end of 2017.</p>
      <p>With just 18 months to run on his deal - as reported previously by Bristol Live - the City hierarchy must snap up the key player to a new contract or risk losing the player next summer. Bristol City fans are realistic enough to know that the club will contemplate the sale of Brownhill in the summer of 2020 if the Robins are not promoted themselves.</p>
      <p>And few City fans would begrudge the former Manchester United schoolboy from making the move to the top division if City are unable next season.</p>
      <p>A vital period is approaching in the future of the Manchester City supporter, and fans will hope that after the sales of Bobby Reid, Joe Bryan, Lloyd Kelly and Aden Flint, times may be different. The finances in the EFL may dictate otherwise, however.</p>
      <p>The coming months may prove key.</p>
