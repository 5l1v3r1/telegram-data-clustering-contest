      <p>Volunteers at Stowupland Falcons FC were dismayed after quad bike vandals left tyre tracks on the field overnight on Saturday, November 2, causing the cancellation of Sunday youth fixtures.</p>
      <p>But after hearing of the club's plight in this newspaper, Malcolm Birt, from Ipswich, came forward to donate a roller to the club to help with repairs as well as a cheque for £50.</p>
      <p>The club also received a £100 donation towards pitch repairs from neighbouring club Mendlesham FC.</p>
      <p>In an email, Mendlesham chairman Tim Mack said he was "appalled" by the vandalism.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is difficult enough keeping a football club funded and volunteer rich without having to deal with such mindless vandalism."</p>
      <p>Pete Mayhew, Stowupland Falcons chairman, said: "It was a really nice thing for Malcolm to do.</p>
      <p>"It came out of the blue and he phoned up and said he wanted to help.</p>
      <p>"He said he'd been involved with local football in his younger days and that the roller was more use to us than it was to him.</p>
      <p>"He also donated £50 towards repairs which was really kind."</p>

      <p>"There can be a little bit of rivalry between clubs," he said. "But it's nice to know that when it comes to the crunch, they wanted to help out a fellow football club.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately, we are all trying to do the same thing and bring football to the people.</p>
      <p>"Everyone talks about money in football, but let me tell you, there isn't much at the grass roots level.</p>
      <p>"£100 is a lot of money to Mendlesham and it's such a kind thing for them to do.</p>
      <p>"I think it shows that people do come together."</p>
      <p>Mr Mayhew said that due to the extensive rain in the past week, the club has so far been unable to work on the pitches.</p>
      <p>"The games were called off due to the weather this weekend and so we haven't been able to roll it yet.</p>
      <p>"We are hoping to get on there at some stage on Sunday and get them ready for next weekend," he added.</p>
