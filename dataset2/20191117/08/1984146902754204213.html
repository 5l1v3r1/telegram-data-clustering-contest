      <p>Winter is here, which means many of us will be coming down with bugs over the next few months.</p>
      <p>While colds, flu and fever can all strike us down, last year one winter vomiting <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/health/">bug</a> was so severe it led to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/unprecedented-demand-beds-helped-cause-14567381">hospital wards having to shut</a> to contain its spread: norovirus.</p>
      <p>Children, older people and those with low immune systems are especially at risk of contracting norovirus over winter. It's highly infectious and can lead to days of vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches and drastic dehydration.</p>
      <h3>What is norovirus?</h3>

      <p>Norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.</p>
      <p>The bug is common in winter – and places with high concentrations of vulnerable people, such as children, older people and patients, are especially susceptible.</p>
      <p>Diane Sisterson, lead nurse for infection prevention and control at Northumbria Healthcare <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> Foundation Trust , said: “People can get norovirus at any time of the year, though it’s particularly common during the winter where it often circulates in the community, and due to its highly infectious nature, can affect people in care homes and hospitals.</p>
      <p>“Whilst it is unpleasant, it is rarely serious and typically lasts two to three days.”</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms of norovirus?</h3>

      <p>Norovirus often causes violent diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
      <p>This can lead to dehydration, which further saps energy.</p>
      <p>Raised temperature, aching limbs and headaches are also associated with norovirus.</p>
      <p>Usually, it lasts for about two days.</p>
      <h3>How can I avoid getting norovirus?</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article1383066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_one-of-the-best-ways-to-protect-against-norovirus-infection-is-by-practicing-good-hand-hygiene-391549516.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>One of the best ways to protect against norovirus infection is by washing your hands</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Norovirus is spread by touch so make sure you wash and dry your hands often and thoroughly with soap and warm water. Don’t rely on alcohol hand gels alone.</p>
      <p>Be careful when clearing up after someone who has been ill – wash your hands frequently.</p>
      <p>Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated with a household cleaning product.</p>
      <p>Wash any items of clothing, bedding, or towels that could have been contaminated on a separate hot wash, to ensure the virus is killed.</p>
      <h3>What should I do if I get norovirus?</h3>
      <p>There is no specific treatment for norovirus and so going to the doctor or hospital won’t help – in fact, you’re likely to spread the disease.</p>
      <p>Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration, especially in the very young or the elderly.</p>
      <p>Consult a pharmacist for advice on over-the-counter medicines to reduce any fever or aches.</p>
      <p>Get plenty of rest.</p>
      <p>Stay away from work and keep children away from school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped.</p>
      <p>Don’t visit vulnerable family or friends, especially people in hospitals or care homes, to reduce the risk of passing the virus on.</p>
      <h3>You should RING your GP or NHS 111 if:</h3>
      <p>- you or your child has severe dehydration;</p>
      <p>- has bloody diarrhoea;</p>
      <p>your symptoms haven’t improved after a few days;</p>
      <p>- or you have a serious underlying health condition.</p>
