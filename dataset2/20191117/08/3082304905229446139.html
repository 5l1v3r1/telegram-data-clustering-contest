        <b>Barcelona star Gerard Pique has credited Manchester United for his successful career as a football player. The centre-back moved to United as a 17-year-old back in 2004 before returning to Barcelona four years later.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pique, who made only 23 appearances for United, accepted that he couldn’t play as much as he would have wanted under Sir Alex Ferguson at United, he learned a lot there and became the player he is today because of the Premier League club. He won the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and the League Cup during his four-year stay in England.</p>
      <p>“When I left my friends there to spend four years at Manchester United it was tough. At the same time that was a great experience for me. I grew up a lot there. I am who I am because of the period I had at Manchester United, even though I didn’t play as much as I wanted to,” Pique told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/gerard-pique-revamped-davis-cup-project">Observer</a>.</p>
      <p>“But in my position, there were two centre-backs who were among the top three in the world at the time [Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic]. But being at home, and having the career I have had at home, has been a great pleasure and I am very proud of it.”</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old also opened up on whether he has decided about retirement yet.</p>
      <p>“Right now my thoughts are that every year has to be my last year. I want to dedicate as much as I can to football. I want to end my career in the best way possible. I don’t know if it will be one more year, two more years, five more years. But I am happy at Barcelona,” he said.</p>
