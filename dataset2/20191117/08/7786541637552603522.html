      <p><b>VENICE, ItalyÂ (AP)</b> - Venetians are bracing for the prospect of another exceptional tide in a season that is setting records.</p>
      <p>Officials are forecasting a 1.6 meter (5 feet, 2 inch) surge of water Sunday through the lagoon city. That comes after Tuesday's 1.87-meter flood, the worst in 53 years, followed by high tide of 1.54 meters on Friday.</p>
      <p>Those two events mark the first time since records began in 1872 that two floods topped 1.5 meters in the same year - much less the same week. The city's mayor says the flooding damages are in "the hundreds of millions" and Italian officials have declared a state of emergency for the area.</p>
      <p>Tourists with suitcases were rushing to grab the last water taxis to get to the mainland Sunday before service is interrupted in anticipation of the high tide.</p>
