      <p>DUBAI: Palestinian-Dutch model Bella Hadid recently opened up about her struggles with depression and the pressure of being a runway model as she spoke at the Vogue Fashion Festival in Paris on Nov. 15.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old revealed that there were days she would “cry every single morning” when her career first kicked off.</p>
      <p>“I would cry during my lunch breaks, I would cry before I slept. I was very emotionally unstable for a while when I was working 14-hour days for four months straight as an 18-year-old. I think I just wanted to breathe a little bit. And so it kind of put me in a spiral,” she shared, as per WWD.</p>
      <p>The California-bred beauty added “For a while I just didn’t want to talk about it, and I’ve gone through a lot in the past few years with my health. I feel guilty for being able to live this incredible life, have the opportunities that I do, but somehow still be depressed. It doesn’t make sense.”</p>
      <p>Hadid, who has walked the Victoria’s Secret runway three times, also revealed that she had never felt comfortable until she walked for Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty show this September.  </p>
