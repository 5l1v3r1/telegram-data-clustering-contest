        <b>Chandler from FRIENDS or Joker? Who did the arm-raise dance better? Mathew Perry’s tweet on the same will brighten up your Sunday!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The iconic FRIENDS ended its long run years ago, but the show’s characters have still kept it alive in our hearts, as well the headlines. Be it Jennifer Aniston’s Instagram antics or Courtney Cox’s mini-reunions. Now, here’s an exciting piece of news about the same, albeit not on any get-together. It’s Mathew Perry AKA Chandler’s latest tweet that has got the internet talking and, of course, laughing. The actor posted a hilarious picture that sort of connected Chandler with Joaquin Phoenix's Joker.</p>
      <p>The picture shared by Mathew sees him as Chandler Bing, from one of the FRIENDS episodes, dancing with his hands up in the air, which stroked a resemblance to that to Joker standing with his own arms raised. The caption above these images read, “Cinematic parallels.” In his caption, he wrote, “You’re welcome. Sorry I don’t know who made the image, but bravo.” Well, this particular picture of Joaquin has given birth to an ocean of memes already and Chandler jumping onto the bandwagon with his own creativity had got the netizens into splits, a lot of them even approved of this connection.</p>
