      <p>Exam season is in full swing at Summer Bay High, and Ryder (Lukas Radovich) catches up with his classmate Blake (Tom Wilson) to talk about how stressful it is. Blake reckons it must be worse for Ryder living with a teacher, then tries to get a free pizza out of him using his staff discount at Salt.</p>
      <p>Blake then goes on to try and get a beer out of his friend, despite being underage. Ryder soon finds out why Blake really wants to catch up – he and his mates are planning a scheme where they cheat off each other in the exams, taking turns to use the paper of the person who has a particular subject as their strength. As History is Ryder’s strength, he asks if Ryder will join their scheme.</p>
      <p>Ryder is shocked that Blake would consider such a plan, but Blake reveals his dad is putting a lot of pressure on him to do well. The next day, Blake asks if Ryder has had any further thoughts, and Ryder tells him he’s not going to get on board.</p>

      <p>His feelings are affected, however, when Blake gets a stressful call from his father. After lying and saying he’s studying in the library, Blake tells Ryder he’s got pressure to do well and become a lawyer.</p>

      <p>Ryder is left divided about helping Blake, but is relieved when he later reveals the cheating group got caught by Mrs Astoni (Kestie Morassi), so it’s off. His relief is short-lived, though, as Blake has cooked up an even worse plan – as he doesn’t have enough time to study for the next exam, he’s going to drug the exam supervisor with sleeping pills so they won’t get caught cheating!</p>
      <p>Ryder is stuck in a dilemma. Does he commit social suicide and tell the teachers about Blake’s plans, or does he let his classmate do something illegal that could put a teacher at serious risk?</p>
