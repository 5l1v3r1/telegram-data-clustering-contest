      <h1>There have been more mass shootings than days in 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:03:21+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/" target="_blank">Jason Silverstein</a></address>
      <p>The number of <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/america-most-deadly-mass-shootings/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">mass shootings across the U.S.</a> thus far in 2019 has outpaced the number of days this year, according to a gun violence research group. This puts 2019 on pace to be the first year since 2016 with an average of more than one <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-mass-shootings-continue-lawndale-neighborhood-seven-dead-40-wounded-weekend/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">mass shooting</a> a day.</p>
      <p>As of November 17, which is the 321st day of the year, there have been 369 mass shootings in the U.S., according to data from the nonprofit <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">Gun Violence Archive</a> (GVA), which tracks every mass shooting in the country. Twenty-eight of those shootings were mass murders.</p>
      <p>The GVA defines a mass shooting as any incident in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter. The group also tracks mass murders as defined by the FBI — incidents in which at least four people are killed. There have been 28 mass murders so far in 2019. The FBI does not have a formal definition of a mass shooting.</p>
      <p>The toll of 369 mass shootings includes several high-profile attacks, two of which happened within 24 hours of each other:</p>
      <p>A shooting at <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/saugus-high-school-shooting-police-southern-california-today-2019-11-14-live-stream-updates/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">Saugus High School</a> in Santa Clarita, California, on November 14, with two teenage students killed and three wounded.

      <p>The GVA said there have been a total of <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/number-of-gun-deaths?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">34,365 gun deaths</a> — including homicides, suicides and accidents — and <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/number-of-gun-injuries?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">25,929 injuries</a>, as of November 17.</p>
      <p>The last time the mass shooting toll topped days of the year was 2016, which had 382 mass shootings — the most in any year since the Gun Violence Archive started keeping track. The past two years came close, with 346 mass shootings in 2017 and 340 in 2018.</p>
