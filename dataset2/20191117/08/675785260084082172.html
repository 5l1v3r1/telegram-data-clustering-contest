      <h1>Man Utd face Jadon Sancho battle as PSG prepare £120m transfer hijack</h1>
      <h2>Paris Saint-Germain could be about to enter the race to sign Jadon Sancho as they look for a long-term replacement for Neymar</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:30:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United could face a challenge from Paris Saint-Germain in their bid to bring in Jadon Sancho.</p>
      <p>England star Sancho, 19, continues to be tipped to return to his homeland with United.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-line-up-200m-20889527">Mirror Sport reported this week</a> that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bring in Sancho and Erling Haaland in a £200m double swoop.</p>
      <p>But French champions PSG could be about to rival United for the Borussia Dortmund winger.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205352/PSG-ready-to-hijack-120m-Man-Utd-transfer-of-Jadon-Sancho-because-of-Neymar">The Express reports</a> PSG have made Sancho their No.1 transfer target for next summer as a potential replacement for Neymar.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have also been credited with an interest in signing Sancho, who could cost as much as £120m if he leaves Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The England international's future is unclear after a series of incidents this season.</p>
      <p>He was dropped after returning late from international duty last month.</p>
      <p>Dortmund boss Lucien Favre then dragged him off in the first half of the recent drubbing at the hands of Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>United are aware that failing to qualify for next season's Champions League could cost them dear in their pursuit of the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> youngster.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, United have reportedly drawn up a shortlist of eight long-term targets, including Sancho and Red Bull Salzburg goal machine Haaland.</p>
      <p>England trio James Maddison, Declan Rice and Callum Wilson are all on their radar, as is Lyon striker Moussa Dembele.</p>
      <p>United also remain interested in Aston Villa pair Jack Grealish and John McGinn as they bid to bring in young talent.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is likely to be given funds to strengthen his squad in January and could make his move if the top targets become available.</p>
