      <p>LUXEMBOURG (AP) — Cristiano Ronaldo took his career tally to 99 international goals on Sunday as Portugal qualified for the 2020 European Championship with a 2-0 win at Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>The Juventus star rushed to tap in a shot by teammate Diogo Jota that was just inches from going over the goal-line in the 86th minute. The nudge left Jota without his first international goal, and Ronaldo one more strike from the century mark.</p>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes got Portugal’s first goal against the flow of play in the 39th when he scored from a long pass by Bruno Silva.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg had outplayed Portugal until that point, dealing with the poor field conditions better than the defending European champions.</p>
      <p>Portugal advanced to Euro 2020 in second place in Group B. Ukraine had already gone through as the group winner.</p>
      <p>“Our performance was good given the conditions,” Fernandes said. “We knew this game would be based on quantity rather than quality. We battled a lot and our great spirit is what helped us to win.”</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Ronaldo scored a hat trick to lead a 6-0 rout of Lithuania, but he was largely kept in check by Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>Also Sunday, Serbia drew 2-2 with Ukraine to finish the group in third place. Serbia still has a chance to reach the tournament through the playoff process.</p>
      <p>Ukraine finished with 20 points. Portugal had 17, Serbia 14, Luxembourg 4, and Lithuania 1.</p>
