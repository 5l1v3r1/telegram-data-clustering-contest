      <p>Police officers fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters marking the first anniversary of the Paris yellow vest movement.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations began on November 17 last year as 300,000 people took to the streets in defiance of planned increases to fuel charges and the rising cost of living with many saying the French government’s policies placed too great a burden on working and middle class families.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, as the movement – which has become symbolised by protesters wearing yellow high-vis jackets, police officers were deployed in force around the capital, detaining 46 people by early afternoon.</p>
      <p>Crowd control measures were deployed after protesters smashed windows and entered a shopping mall near Place d’Italie, in the south-east of the city. Others were said to have throwing stones at officers and set fires.</p>
      <p>Bank windows and bus shelters were also smashed as demonstrations turned violent leading to several police charges.</p>

      <p>Rosa Drissi, who joined the movement on its first day, said she struggles to make ends meet with just 800 euro per month.</p>

      <p>She said she has been protesting ‘for my retirement, and for my buying power’ and believed the movement had evolved since its inception.</p>
      <p>‘We were novices at the beginning. We didn’t know politics; we didn’t know how to be in the streets. We didn’t know how to protest,’ she said. ‘We made errors, we made mistakes. That’s normal.’</p>

      <p>The grassroots campaign has continued despite President Emmanuel Macron reversing some of his tax plans and offering a 10 billion euro package of measures to address concerns.</p>
      <p>Police armed in riot gear guarded the Arc de Triomphe overlooking the Champs-Elysees, which was the scene of weekly rioting and police crackdowns at the height of last year’s protests.</p>
