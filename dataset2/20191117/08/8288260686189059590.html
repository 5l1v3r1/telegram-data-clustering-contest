      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:36:07+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:36</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Labour claims its "real" living wage will give workers a pay rise of up to almost £6,000.</p>
      <p>The party has vowed to give workers who earn the national minimum wage at least £9,000 more by 2024 than the Tories.</p>
      <p>Workers who currently earn a minimum wage job would get an immediate pay rise of between £3,444 and £5,986 under the party's plans.</p>
      <p>Their promise to immediately introduce a £10-an-hour Real Living Wage for all workers over 16 will give approximately 7.5 million people a pay rise, including more than 1.2 million young people, according to their analysis of ONS figures on earnings.</p>
      <p>The current minimum wage for people 25 and over is £8.21, while for 16 to 17-year-olds it is £4.35.</p>

      <p>Workers 25 and over will get an average pay rise of £3,444, while 16 to 18-year-olds will get an average pay rise of £3,497, the party said, adding that 18 to 20-year-olds will get an average pay rise of £5,986, and 21 to 24-year-olds will get an average pay rise of £4,485.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "Labour's Real Living Wage will put more money into the pockets of the workers that need it most and give a boost to the economy.</p>
      <p>"Over the last decade, the Tories have allowed in-work poverty to soar and left millions in insecure jobs.</p>
      <p>"Labour will deliver real change for the many, not the few."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Cat Smith, Labour's shadow minister for youth affairs, said: "A decade of Tory austerity has made life much harder for young people, with many young workers crippled with debt and resorting to food banks.</p>
      <p>"Thousands of young workers face out-and-out discrimination, receiving lower wages than older colleagues for the same day's work.</p>
      <p>"We believe all young people deserve a wage they can live on and that workers should be rewarded for their work, not their age.</p>
      <p>"The next Labour government will stand up for young workers by abolishing the youth rate of the minimum wage and immediately introducing a Real Living Wage of £10 per hour for everyone from the age of 16."</p>
