      <h1>Leclerc blames himself for error, apologises to Ferrari</h1>

      <p><b>SAO PAULO: </b>Charles Leclerc blamed himself and apologised to Ferrari on Saturday after qualifying fourth on the grid for Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>The Monegasque driver, who is set to take a 10-place penalty after taking a new engine, said he had made a mistake during his best lap, which had cost him three-tenths of a second, and wrecked his hopes of taking pole.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think pole position was out of reach today,” said Leclerc. “But I am very disappointed with myself as I made a mistake which cost me three-tenths.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t do the job in the car so ‘sorry to the team’, but with my grid penalty it was always going to be very tough.</p>

      <p>“So, I will be in full-on attack mode tomorrow. I enjoy the first from the back and I will really try to ensure I do a good job for the team.”</p>
      <p>Red Bull’s Max Verstappen claimed his second career pole for Red Bull and will start ahead of Leclerc’s team-mate four-time champion Sebastian Vettel on the front row.</p>

      <p>Vettel said: “I had a bit a wobble in the exit of the last corner of my first run, but I think Max improved his time so fair play. It’s his pole.</p>
      <p>“I am happy with the front row and look forward to see what we can do tomorrow in the race.</p>
      <p>“We got better and better through this qualifying, which was the target and we were improving so we will see how it plays out.</p>
      <p>“Red Bull and Mercedes look stronger in managing the tyres, but we have the speed and the power. I am cautiously optimistic – and it should be a good race.”</p>
