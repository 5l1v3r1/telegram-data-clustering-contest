      <p>A Zimbabwean born UK based mental health nurse who threatened his wife with an axe has escaped an immediate jail term.</p>
      <p>Tanyaradzwa Mhangami had sent his partner threatening messages while on a night shift before he arrived home and they continued to row while sitting in her car.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old continued to be aggressive towards her, told her not to mess with him and even referenced a case he had heard in the news where a man had killed his spouse.</p>
      <p>They both went inside their home in Clay Pitts, Braintree, and Mhangami armed himself with an axe and chillingly asked his wife ‘you don’t want me to use this on you, do you?’</p>
      <p>Fearing for her life, she left the house and called the police.</p>
      <p>Mhangami is reported to have taken too many anti-depressant medication at the time of the incident and he was on the verge of a mental breakdown .</p>
      <p>He plans to report himself to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.</p>
      <p>He was handed a two year jail sentence suspended for two years after he admitted affray and three assaults on emergency workers.</p>
      <p>Mhangami must also attend 30 rehabilitation days in the next two years and do 120 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>He is also banned from going back to the address for a year.</p>
