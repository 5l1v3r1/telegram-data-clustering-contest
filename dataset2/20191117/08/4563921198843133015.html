      <h1>Hilton’s Hidden Gems Series: Bentonville, Arkansas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:40:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">Newsroom</a></address>
      <p>The first <a href="https://newsroom.hilton.com/brand-communications/news/hidden-gems-hilton-series-urges-travelers-to-seek-the-lesser-known">Hidden Gem</a> of the series is <b>Bentonville, Arkansas</b> (yes, the home of Walmart, though that wasn’t a factor in choosing), where visitors can escape the hustle and bustle of the big city and embrace the natural beauty of the Ozarks. Here, small town charm and rich cultural experiences combine. Bentonville offers something for every type of traveler, from the nature-lover to the art connoisseur. The city is a scenic drive from Little Rock, Tulsa or Kansas City if traveling by car, or accessible through the nearby Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport. Excellent fall foliage and favorable weather make autumn one of the best times of year to visit, when leaves turn shades of gold, red and orange, inspiring locals and visitors alike to get outdoors.</p>

        <b>Things to Do</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cyclists and runners will enjoy the more than 40 miles of hard and soft surface trails in Bentonville. Try the <a href="https://www.nwatrails.org/trail/razorback-regional-greenway/">Razorback Regional Greenway</a>, a 36-mile, primarily off-road, mixed-use trail that travels from north Bentonville to south Fayetteville and passes through dozens of community destinations, including historic sites, shopping areas and numerous parks.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty to see for art and museum lovers, too. Art connoisseurs can admire the local arts scene at the world-renowned <a href="https://crystalbridges.org/">Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art</a>, where a permanent collection of American artwork, from famed artists like Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol, is supplemented by a rotating array of temporary exhibits. Bentonville visitors can also explore the popular <a href="https://www.walmartmuseum.com/visit/museum/">Walmart Museum</a> — located in Walmart founder Sam Walton’s original five and dime store — and the little ones can get some hands-on learning at the <a href="https://www.amazeum.org/">Scott Family Amazeum</a>, which is 50,000 square feet of interactive exhibits.</p>
      <p>Foodies can treat their taste buds to the unique high-South cuisine of the Ozarks, described as traditional Southern cuisine with a modern twist — think cheese grits made with smoked gouda, pan-seared trout served with a side of Hoppin’ John (a dish made with black-eyed peas and rice) and catfish dip made with crème fraîche. The cuisine typically includes local and seasonal ingredients, with many restaurant menus changing every season. Try restaurants like <a href="http://tuskandtrotter.com/">Tusk &amp; Trotter</a>, <a href="https://www.alocalhangout.com/">The Holler</a> and <a href="https://www.louise.cafe/">Louise</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.downtownbentonville.org/">Bentonville Square</a>, located in downtown, is lined with shops, restaurants and museums. The square is also home to events and activities year-round, featuring everything from a <a href="https://www.downtownbentonville.org/event/brrl">monthly concert series</a> to <a href="https://www.downtownbentonville.org/event/goat-yoga">goat yoga</a>. Over the holidays, the square transforms into a winter wonderland with<a href="https://www.downtownbentonville.org/event/lights"> holiday lights</a>, ice skating and an annual <a href="https://www.downtownbentonville.org/event/winter-market">winter market</a> and <a href="https://www.downtownbentonville.org/event/parade">Christmas parade</a>.</p>
      <p>As part of the northwest Arkansas region, Bentonville is also close to many cities that are perfect for a short daytrip. Try a visit to Fayetteville to tour the University of Arkansas (about 25 miles away), or take a trip to eclectic <a href="https://www.eurekasprings.org/">Eureka Springs</a> (less than 40 miles away), where the entire downtown is listed as a National Historic Site.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where to Stay</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unwind from a day of adventures at <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/bnthwhw-homewood-suites-bentonville-rogers/">Homewood Suites by Hilton Bentonville-Rogers</a>, located near many of Bentonville’s notable attractions, including the Crystal Bridges Museum, Razorback Regional Greenway and Bentonville Square, all less than five miles away. Relax poolside year-round at the hotel’s indoor pool or unwind in a spacious suite with the whole family, even the furry ones (yes, they’re allowed).</p>
      <p>Guests can attend a complimentary evening social Monday – Thursday with snacks and drinks. Wake up the next morning and enjoy a free, hot breakfast (or even just a grab-and-go snack) before starting on your next adventure.</p>
