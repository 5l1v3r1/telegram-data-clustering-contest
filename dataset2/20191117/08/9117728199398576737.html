        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> passed on the chance to drive a Red Bull with a Honda engine but the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> driver has tipped his hat to his former team and their engine provider for the package they've pulled together.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ricciardo's former teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> secured his second career pole position at Interlagos on Saturday and will start ahead of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a>. It is the second pole position Verstappen and Honda have achieved this season after the Dutchman's maiden one at the Hungarian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Ricciardo will start down in 11th for the race but he found time to give credit to Honda and Red Bull after Max's pole position lap.</p>
      <p><i>"Yeah, I was impressed with that,"</i> Ricciardo said when asked about it by <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/147205/ricciardo-impressed-with-red-bull-improvement">Autosport</a>.</p>

        <i>"I just watched Max's lap probably five minutes ago and that's definitely a good lap.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I've been with Max for three years so I know he's capable of putting a car on pole, but I think to have that pace - I mean it's a downforce but it's also a power circuit - was impressive.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"So they certainly found something. Hats off to them.</i>

        <i>"And actually hand on heart, some people are like, 'ahh, he's probably bitter a Red Bull got on pole', but I think it's great. I want to see more teams fight for it. The last few races has been Mercedes or Ferrari on pole, so with Red Bull it's good.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Now obviously it's our job to get up there, but I'm glad that it's now a three-way fight."</i>
