      <h1>West Brom loan star has made this key January decision- reports</h1>
      <h2>West Brom latest news | The West Ham loanee has been in scintillating form since his summer switch to the Championship</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:58:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Grady Diangana is set on staying with West Bromwich Albion, despite West Ham having the option to recall him in January.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been an integral part of Slaven Bilic’s side as they have raced to the top of the Championship.</p>

      <p>An injury to Hammers forward Manuel  Lanzini had raised the possibility of Manuel Pellegrini recalling Diangana, serving as a cruel reminder of the Harvey Barnes situation of last January.</p>
      <p>But Pellegrini has hinted that he wants the youngster to stay with Albion’s promotion chasers and that feeling is mutual, according to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/update-on-grady-diangana-west-ham/">Football Insider.</a></p>

      <p>The report suggests that Diangana would rather stay in the Black Country and play a key role in a promotion push, rather than be a peripheral figure with his parent club.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It is claimed that he wishes to return to East London in the summer and making a concerted effort in breaking into the side, but until then wants to remain at The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>So far this season, he has scored four times and created a further five, dazzling <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> fans, pundits and neutrals alike.</p>
