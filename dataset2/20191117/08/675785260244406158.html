      <p>Lions coach Wayne Bennett has predicted more disappointment unless his bosses are up to the demands of international rugby.</p>
      <p>The Lions self-destructed here in the second half in a bitterly disappointing end to a disastrous tour.</p>
      <p>Tonga announced a national holiday in the wake of beating the Lions and Papua New Guinea may well do the same.</p>
      <p>With New Zealand also winning twice, it is a tour that Bennett described as “obviously disappointing because we have underperformed”.</p>
      <p>But the Aussie, now out of contract, insists the same could happen again if bosses don’t improve the preparation.</p>
      <p>He said: “England or Great Britain cannot sit back and think that they can come out of a good competition and have good players and can come in under-prepared.</p>
      <p>“Australia come in with an Origin Series behind them, New Zealand came in having played Australia at the end of the season.</p>

      <p>“Everyone is doing more preparation than we are. If we want to compete with them, we have got to get back to that level.”</p>
      <p>Neither the Lions nor England had a mid-season Test this year and the World Cup Nines also prevented the Lions having a proper training camp ahead of the tour.</p>
      <p>England are expected to play the Kiwis in June and Bennett (above) said: “We definitely do need that. We didn’t have anything this year and it had a bit of impact on us.</p>
      <p>“We have not nailed our preparation for the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>“We need a 10-day to 12-day period otherwise there will continue to be disappointment.”</p>

      <p>Bennett insists he wants a new deal to coach England through to the 2021 World Cup, saying: “I do not think anyone can say I haven’t got the appetite.”</p>
      <p>The Lions dominated most of the first half, with Blake Austin touching down and Josh Hodgson grabbing a second try.</p>
      <p>But they allowed Edwin Ipape to cross in the dying seconds of the half and the Kumuls then snuffed the life out of the Lions with four second- half tries.</p>
      <p>Bennett said: “Whilst we have to swallow a bitter pill, the other side of the ledge is that the international game is getting stronger.”</p>
