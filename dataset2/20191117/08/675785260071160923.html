      <h1>Prince Andrew 'evasive and heavily coached' in BBC grilling says body language expert</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Body language expert Darren Stanton analyses the Duke of York's interview with Emily Maitlis on BBC's Newsnight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T08:59:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A body language expert has said Prince Andrew was being 'evasive and potentially deceptive' during a startling interview about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>On Saturday evening the Duke of York sat down with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis for an intense, hour long interview concerning allegations the Prince had sex with a teenager.</p>
      <p>Experienced body language expert and psychologist Darren Stanton watched Andrew with a laser-like scrutiny as the 59-year-old broke his silence on the topic of the allegations and Epstein.</p>
      <p>"The behaviour I observed during the documentary is consistent with someone being evasive and potentially deceptive," Mr Stanton told MirrorOnline.</p>
      <p>"I am not convinced the account was consistent or congruent with the true emotion of the Prince."</p>

      <p>During the interview Ms Maitlis raised allegations made by Virginia Giuffre that the Duke of York had sex with her when she was seventeen.</p>
      <p>She also asked the Prince whether he thought the alleged victim was lying and how he came to be photographed with the then teenager.</p>
      <p>Mr Stanton suggested the Duke's reaction during such intense periods of questioning were not consistent with somebody telling the whole truth.</p>
      <p>"I noted Prince Andrew at times appeared to feign or overcompensate some expression of surprise," the psychologist said.</p>
      <p> "Either he was already aware of the information and tried to again distance himself from already knowing it, or he was trying to convey total surprise.</p>
      <p>"Either way, it didn't appear to be genuine."</p>

      <p>A key point of the interview focused on photographs taken of Ms Giuffre and Prince Andrew together.</p>
      <p>Mr Stanton noted that the Prince refused to categorically deny meeting the then teenager, instead using 'evasive, non-committal language'.</p>
      <p>The body language expert also argued that the way the royal was sitting was unnatural and appeared to have been considered prior to the interview.</p>
      <p>"He has very stoic body language," Mr Stanton said. "I believe he has been heavily coached."</p>
      <p>Mr Stanton suggested that at numerous points throughout the interview Prince Andrew 'overcompensated' in terms of the intensity and duration of his eye contact.</p>
      <p>That, along with periods of rapid blinking, is an indicator of dishonesty, he said.</p>

      <p>Mr Stanton has provided detailed body language analysis for just shy of a decade, having formerly worked as a police officer.</p>
      <p>"The Prince Andrew interview is very interesting," he told the Mirror. "Because there are a number of concerning behaviours.</p>
      <p>"As the interview commences, the prince is sat still in the same position pretty much for the duration of the interview.</p>
      <p>"As he was questioned he begins to display some interesting gestures which are the body's unconscious gestures - in psychological terms, we call this leakage."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Stanton goes on to compare one part of the interview to former US president Bill Clinton's famous 'non-denial denial' when he was grilled over the Monica Lewinsky affair.</p>
      <p>"When he is asked about his time at Epstein's house and the photographs, he replied: 'I have no recollection or I've been trying to remember.' This is not a straight out denial.</p>
      <p>"If someone was confidence they had not been present in a location or behaviour, the response would be indigent and categorical , the use of this kind of language is reminiscent of President Clinton saying 'I did not have relations with that woman'.</p>
      <p>"There are lots of uses of that we call distancing language... to create a distance between themselves and a person or situation.</p>
      <p>"When asked if he would give a legal deposition he begins to move back to the fall back position of 'it's up to my legal team'.</p>
      <p>"Someone who was keen to help and had no knowledge of anything would simply answer 'yes, I'll do anything I can'. Not begin to waffle and talk about legal advisors."</p>

      <p>Known as The TV Human Lie Detector, Mr Stanton has previously provided analysis of other members of the royal family.</p>
      <p>In an interview with MailOnline last December Mr Stanton described <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> as a "very comfortable woman" who regularly adopts "power poses" .</p>
      <p>Kate Middleton by contrast holds herself in a way that suggests caution and formality.</p>
      <p>He said at the time: "The handbag that she always holds in front of her is so clearly a defence - a barrier between herself and the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think she’s as confident as Meghan - Kate comes across as utterly charming and genuine, but is far more formal and cautious."</p>
