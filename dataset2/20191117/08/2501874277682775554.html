      <p>Beginning Monday, November 18, 2019, the Goleta Sanitary District will be replacing a sewer line on Hollister Avenue within City of Santa Barbara jurisdiction.  This work will require both westbound lanes of Hollister Avenue between La Patera Lane and Robin Hill Road to be closed between November 18, 2019, and December 16, 2019. The left-turn lane from both Hollister Avenue and Robin Hill Road will also be closed.  Traffic will be rerouted to the eastbound side of the road, leaving one lane of eastbound and one lane of westbound traffic open for travel.  There will also be a detour in place for traffic heading northbound on Robin Hill Road from Hollister Avenue.</p>
      <p>The second phase of the project will include replacing the sewer line on Robin Hill Road within City of Goleta jurisdiction.  This work is scheduled to begin on January 2, 2020 and will require the northbound lane on Robin Hill Road to be closed, allowing only southbound traffic down Robin Hill to Hollister Avenue. This phase of work is anticipated to be completed by March 2020.</p>
      <p>For questions, please contact Luis Astorga at Goleta Sanitary District.  The contact number is 805-967-4519.</p>
