      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — “Ford v Ferrari” put its competition in the rearview, racing to a $31 million debut at the box office in a No. 1 finish that counted as a win for big-budget originality.</p>
      <p>James Mangold’s racing drama rode into the weekend with strong reviews and Oscar buzz for its for leads, Christian Bale and Matt Damon. And audiences enthusiastically greeted it, giving the $98 million movie an A-plus CinemaScore.</p>
      <p>“Ford v Ferrari,” which dramatizes the Ford Motor Co.’s push to unseat the perennial power Ferrari at France’s 24-hour Les Mans race in 1966, has been considered a kind of throwback film, built largely on story, practical effects and star power.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Banks’ “Charlie’s Angels” reboot couldn’t keep up. The Kristen Stewart-led film opened below expectations with $8.6 million.</p>
