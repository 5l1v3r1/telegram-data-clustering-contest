      <h3>Lindsey Pelas’ Cleavage Is Hard To Ignore In Curve-Hugging Blue Dress</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Lindsey Pelas likely sent several hearts aflutter when she posted a photo of herself on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B48dcbpg9mq/">Instagram</a> in which she’s rocking a curve-hugging blue dress. The slinky belted dress features a large keyhole neckline that gives her 9 million followers a great view of her cleavage. It’s made all the more alluring by Lindsey’s seductive pose.</p>
      <p>The model, who describes herself as “genetically gifted,” accessorized her look with simple gold earrings and accentuated her natural beauty with a soft, glamorous makeup look. She also wore her golden hair straight and it falls to her waist.</p>
      <p>“Whole lotta woman,” she wrote in the caption.</p>
      <p>Lindsey also revealed that the dress is by a fashion brand from Australia called Love Nookie. She didn’t reveal the name of the design, however.</p>
      <p>The photo has accumulated close to 50,000 likes and over 670 comments in an hour. In those comments, fans marveled at Lindsey’s physically attractiveness.</p>
      <p>Some of those comments came from fellow models.</p>
      <p>“Whole lot of beauty,” wrote Dolly Castro, a Nicaraguan bombshell with 6.2 million followers on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Her non-famous fans chimed in as well.</p>
      <p>“Definitely more than a handful,” one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>Although Lindsey’s other physical features are dominating the photo, one admirer focused on her eyes.</p>
      <p>“Magnificent in blue,” another fan added. “Makes your eyes really pop!”</p>

      <p>One commenter got very effusive in their praise and appeared to be baring their soul to her.</p>
      <p>“A whole lot of southern goddess,” they wrote. “Most gorgeous woman gods ever created from all the natural beauty to those amazing eyes. Wife goals. I’d marry you in a heartbeat Lindsey P.”</p>

      <p>But a lot of her followers shared more generic expressions of admiration for her beauty.</p>
      <p>“You look absolutely fabulous and gorgeous,” a fourth fan wrote.</p>
      <p>Lindsey is likely used to getting this type of attention thanks to the stunning posts she shares on Instagram. As <i>The Inquisitr</i> noted, she got similarly enthusiastic comments when she posted a photo of herself late last month.</p>
      <p>She’s dressed more casually than in the most recent photo on her page. In this previous photo, she’s braless and wearing a<a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5706841/lindsey-pelas-no-bra/"> tiny white crop top</a> that, short enough to reveal a sliver of her underboob. She paired the top with a pair of distressed blue jeans and isn’t wearing any makeup or jewelry,</p>
      <p>In the caption, Lindsey revealed that the jeans were from Fashion Nova. The photo currently has more than 200,000 likes and over 2,5000 people have commented on the photo.</p>
