      <h1>Video: LSU QB Joe Burrow Trucks A Referee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:23:03+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>At 6-foot-4, 216 pounds, Joe Burrow is a pretty big dude. The <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/lsu/lsu-releases-joe-burrow-video">Heisman favorite</a> has put up some huge numbers with his arm, but he’s dangerous in the open field as a runner as well.</p>
      <p>That was evident against Alabama last week, when some Burrow runs helped seal the game. A referee during tonight’s game against Ole Miss found that out all too well tonight.</p>
      <p>Ona play during tonight’s game in Oxford, Burrow took off up the middle. Unfortunately for one ref, he was in harm’s way as Joe came barreling through.</p>

      <p>LSU entered tonight’s game as a 21-point favorite, and you know head coach Ed Orgeron would love to put some points on his former team tonight. Coach O led the Rebels to a 10-25 record from 2005-07 in his first head coaching opportunities.</p>
      <p>The Rebs aren’t going away though. Moments ago, Ole Miss’ John Rhys Plumlee ran 60 yards for a huge touchdown, and picked up the two-point conversion on the ground to cut the Tigers lead to 34-23.</p>
      <p>The Tigers defense is talented but susceptible, and Rebs’ offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez has done a nice job so far tonight.</p>
      <p>Joe Burrow is cooking on the other side though. He is 26-for-32 tonight for 335 yards and three touchdowns, and has 29 yards on the ground.</p>
