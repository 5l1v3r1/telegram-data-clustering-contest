      <h1>FBR sets up helpline to facilitate taxpayers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:34:52+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/3869/app/" target="_blank">APP</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has announced that it has established a free-of-cost helpline to provide fast and reliable service to the public.</p>
      <p>According to an FBR statement issued on Saturday, the helpline will not only educate the public but will also provide them a forum through which they can file their queries and seek resolution via phone, email or website.</p>
      <p>The helpline team has been at the forefront of resolving the issues that emerge from time to time such as payment of surcharge, guidance for newly launched online sales tax registration application, biannual income tax withholding statement and sales tax returns launched for the new financial year.</p>
      <p>The helpline would provide services round the clock under the Asset Declaration Scheme, the statement added.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the helpline representatives will provide all possible support to the taxpayers in ensuring that they are easily able to navigate through various transactional portals such as the income tax portal (Iris).</p>
      <p>The FBR helpline utilises the internationally recognised customer relationship management (CRM) system, which ensures availability of three-tier support lines, ensuring that the FBR helpline promptly resolves taxpayers’ issues.</p>
      <p>Taxpayers are provided a case number for each complaint lodged and resolution of the case is ensured within 24 hours of lodging the complaint.</p>
      <p>Cases of complex nature, which require legal and technological modification in the system, are resolved within three days after the complaint is lodged.</p>
      <p>The statement added that the FBR was committed to bringing about a service-oriented culture geared towards resolving the challenges faced by investors and taxpayers and helping to improve the ease of doing business.</p>
      <p>“The board understands its responsibilities as a partner in progress, where its sole responsibility is not just to collect taxes but also to ensure that it provides the best service, in order to create a tax-compliant culture while providing the necessary tools for economic growth,” the statement said.</p>
