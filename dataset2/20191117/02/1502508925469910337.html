      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) expects an annual private investment worth $100 million a year in solar and wind projects in India from next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aiib">AIIB </a>expects to tap as much as $100 million green and renewable projects in India from next month, bank's Director General (Investment Operations) Pang Yee Ean said.</p>
      <p>In a month's time, you will see approval of projects in the Renewable Energy sector (in India), said Pang after addressing the South Asian Diaspora Convention on Saturday.</p>
      <p>We should be consistently doing wind and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/solar-projects">solar projects </a>up to $100 million each year I would say each year there would be a $100 million in the private sector for renewable projects.</p>
      <p>More importantly, some of these projects are by the private sector, he said, underlining the importance of private investment to build resilience in infrastructure development.</p>
      <p>Pang also expected the private investments in renewable energy sector in India as foreign direct investment, relieving the Indian government of project financing challenges.</p>
      <p>Describing India as a "vibrant private sector market", Pang said private investments validate business models of infrastructure and ensure it is economically sustainable.</p>
      <p>Conceding that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aiib">AIIB </a>was a "late boomer" in the renewable energy sector, Pang sought to assure that in coming years, more can be expected from the bank, which has till date invested $2.844 billion in Indian projects.</p>
      <p>There will always be a steady stock of projects in the infrastructure roads, rural connectivity, water supply and sanitation among others.</p>
      <p>These are stable stock of projects, he emphasised.</p>
      <p>Asked about <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aiib">AIIB </a>investment projections, Pang said the bank has always based investment on quality of projects.</p>
      <p>We don't do a country projection for each country, neither do we put a cap on each country (investments), he said on the sideline of the convention organised by the Institute of South Asian Studies from November 15 to 17.</p>
      <p>AIIB's big ticket investments include $500 million in Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3, $455 million in Andhra Pradesh Rural Roads Project and $450 million in AP Urban Water Supply Project.</p>
