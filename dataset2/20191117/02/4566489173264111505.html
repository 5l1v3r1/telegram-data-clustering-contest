"That was a very painful race," he said. "Being able to get the win, in the end, was really awesome."</p>
      <p>Finnerty was one of two athletes that broke American records today, along with Melanie Margolis of the Cali Condors, who broke the American record in the women's 400 meter individual medley (IM) race.</p>
