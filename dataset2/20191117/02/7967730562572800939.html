      <p><b>Washington:</b> South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg holds a clear lead among Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, the state that will hold the first nominating contest in February, a new <i>Des Moines Register</i>/CNN/Mediacom opinion poll showed on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg's support climbed to 25 per cent, a 16-point increase since the previous survey in September, CNN reported.</p>

      <p>It said there was a close three-way battle for second with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at 16 per cent, and former vicep-president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders each at 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>Since September, Warren dropped six percentage points and Biden slipped five points, while Sanders gained four points, CNN said.</p>

      <p>Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told the network the news was encouraging and his campaign felt growing momentum in the farm state, but there was "still a lot of work to do" in increasing his name recognition there.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg also led Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa in a Monmouth University poll released on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A <i>New York Times</i>/Sienna poll released earlier this month also showed Buttigieg's support surging in Iowa, but still behind Warren and Sanders. Nationally, he does not fare nearly as well, averaging around 8 per cent in polls.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg's campaign is betting a strong finish in the Iowa caucus on February 3 will help quell questions about whether he is ready for the big stage, and persuade reluctant black and Hispanic voters to give him a second look.</p>

      <p>Buttigieg, 37, has invested heavily in Iowa from the start. His campaign has more than 100 staffers and 20 offices in the state, among the most of any candidate.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg finished the third quarter with $23.4 million in campaign cash on hand, ranking third behind Warren and Sanders at $25.7 million and $33.7 million, respectively. Biden had $8.9 million, forcing his campaign to abandon a promise to reject support from political action committees.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg said that he has seen more enthusiasm for his candidacy in the state since Labor Day and credited his strong performances in the debates and big state events with boosting his campaign.</p>
      <p>Another bright spot in the numbers for Buttigieg is that 63 per cent of likely caucusgoers think his views are about right, the highest of the four candidates tested. Only 7 per cent say his views are too liberal, while 13 per cent feel they're too conservative.</p>
      <p>Biden places second in the "about right" category with 55 per cent, though that is down from 70 per cent in March. Like Buttigieg, 7 per cent say Biden's views are too liberal. But 28 percent say Biden's views are too conservative.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of likely caucusgoers (48 per cent) say Warren's views are about right, compared with 38 per cent who think her views are too liberal. A majority of likely caucusgoers (53 per cent) deem Sanders' political views to be too liberal, up from 44 per cent in March. Thirty-seven per cent say his views are "about right."</p>
