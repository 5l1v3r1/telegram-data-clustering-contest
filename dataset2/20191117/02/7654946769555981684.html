      <p>CHICAGO — The decimated Nets took the United Center court without their three best players and gutted out a hard-fought, 117-111 victory in Chicago with Kyrie Irving looking on from the bench.</p>
      <p>In the end it may turn out to be the best thing for both Irving and the Nets.</p>
      <p>Kevin Durant may miss the entire season and Caris LeVert is expected to miss another five weeks. But the Nets (5-7) wisely opted to rest Irving’s shoulder impingement and nip the problem in the bud. Then they went out and nipped the Bulls with a makeshift lineup.</p>
      <p>The Nets still put six players in double-figures, led by Spencer Dinwiddie (team-high 24 points) and Joe Harris (22 points).</p>
      <p>“[Dinwiddie] is one of our best players. We need him, especially with Caris out. And now, you’ve got Kyrie out,” coach Kenny Atkinson said. “Without taking it all on his shoulders, he’s really stepped up in the past.”</p>
      <p>Dinwiddie made his first start of the season in place of Irving, and has averaged 22.8 points over his past five games. He poured in 20 points in the fourth quarter alone, the highest-scoring period of his career. He and Harris shrugged off foul trouble to make huge plays to help the Nets snap a three-game losing skid.</p>
      <p>But the Nets turned to little-used Theo Pinson as a backup guard, and after logging just three minutes all season he gave them 10 points and some clutch ballhandling. And Brooklyn will need more of that if Irving misses extended time, something Atkinson didn’t rule out.</p>

      <p>“Too early to tell. I think the best way is to say day-to-day. Let’s see [Sunday], let’s see the next day. I don’t want to make a statement right now,” Atkinson said of Irving, who was on pace for a career year until he got hurt Tuesday in Utah.</p>
      <p>“I know he wasn’t 100 percent going into the Denver game, I think we all knew that. But he played through it, and the returns obviously [Saturday] morning weren’t great. So I think it’s a smart thing, I think it’s a prudent thing to do. And we’ll see going forward what it looks like.”</p>
      <p>Saturday looked dire at times, the Nets fielded a lineup of Pinson, Dzanan Musa, Garrett Temple, rookie second-round Nic Claxton and DeAndre Jordan for long stretches. It says something about their defense that they held Chicago to 35.2 percent shooting to snap their skid.</p>
      <p>The Nets led 30-19 after one quarter thanks to that surprisingly aggressive defense and some downright sloppiness by the Bulls (4-9). The Nets had the worst turnover percentage in the entire league entering Saturday, but forced seven in the first quarter and held Chicago to 4-of-21 shooting.</p>
      <p>But that was with Harris pouring in 11 in the opening period to compensate for Dinwiddie going scoreless. That was never sustainable, and when once Harris cooled off, so did the Nets.</p>
      <p>The Nets watched Chicago go on a 23-5 run, led by Zach LaVine (game-high 36 points). Brooklyn fell behind 42-35 on Chandler Hutchinson’s free throws with 5:02 to play in the half.</p>
      <p>They didn’t break the drought until Prince snatched a rebound and went coast-to coast, earning a goaltend against Lauri Markkanen</p>
      <p>The Nets fell behind by as much as 54-43 on LaVine’s 3-pointer. They spent the rest of the half looking to Pinson for ballhandling and Musa for creativity. The game easily could’ve gotten away right there, but they managed to get into the locker room down by just six.</p>
      <p>Down 69-61, the Nets used a 10-4 run to pull even, back-to-back baskets by newcomer Iman Shumpert knotting the game at 73-all.</p>
      <p>And the Nets went on an extended 16-8 run that spanned the third and fourth quarters to take the lead. Consecutive baskets by Dinwiddie and Harris — who’d both subbed back in with four fouls — put them ahead 90-86 with 7:23 remaining.</p>
      <p>The Nets pushed the lead to 99-92 with 3:43 left on a 3-pointer by Prince, who struggled most of the night and finished 4-of-13.</p>
      <p>The Bulls got within two with 8.8 seconds to play, but Harris iced it at the line.</p>
