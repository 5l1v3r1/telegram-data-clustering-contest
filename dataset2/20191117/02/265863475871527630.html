      <p>Channing Tatum has returned to Instagram after taking a break from the social media platform on August 7, 2019. He’s not the first to feel bored and uninspired from social media. Channing Tatum explained in a lengthy post that he was taking a break from Instagram and other platforms including his phone. Though leaving social media isn’t unusual, he may be one of the few celebrities who returned to share pictures of their offspring. Channing returned to Instagram so that he could share pictures of his six-year-old daughter, Everly,  living it up in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>Channing Tatum took six-year-old Everly Tatum to a Vegas arcade where the father and daughter duo had fun playing games, spending time together, and just hanging out. Everly looked adorable as she wore a princess dress and there was no doubt she felt like a princess getting her dad’s full and undivided attention. The pair were all smiles and there were plenty of photos and videos from their excursion that made their way to social media.</p>
      <p>Channing Tatum has 17.3 million Instagram followers and fans were thrilled that he returned. Within minutes of posting to his Instagram story, fans flooded his previous pictures with comments.</p>
      <p>You may see photos from Everly’s and Channing’s father, daughter time below.</p>

      <p>Channing shared a photo of Everly seated on a bike while she played a video game. She looked completely enthralled with the game and was focused intently on the screen. In a video, Channing and Everly were playing the game “Whack a Mole.” Channing was heavily invested in the game but even though he’s known for his strength and agility, it was a bust and he didn’t beat the game.</p>
      <p>Everly didn’t seem to mind and continued spending time with her dad as they both tried to play the game and beat the moles. Both Everly and Channing donned headwear while in the arcade. Everly’s high bun was covered with a white, crochet hairpiece and adorned with long ribbons and flowers that looked as if they were from a lei.</p>
      <p>Channing wore a baseball cap then during his time at the arcade, then put on a Viking helmet over his cap. What do you think of Channing Tatum’s return to social media?</p>
