      <h1>DSS, Sowore and legal and lexical subterfuge - The Nation Newspaper</h1>

      <h4>Idowu Akinlotan</h4>
      <p>Last Friday, the spokesman of the Department of State Service (DSS), Peter Afunanya, suggested that the detention of former National Security Adviser (NSA) Sambo Dasuki, a retired colonel, and Shiite leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, was at the instance of the detainees themselves. Jarring as that explanation may sound, it failed to say which law allows anyone to walk into a detention facility, whether run by the secret service or the Correctional Service, and be promptly detained simply by asking.</p>
      <p>What is more, if the detention of a Nigerian is at the instance of a court, surely his release must also be at the instance of that court. And if a detainee had no freedom to determine his course of action once a court had sanctioned his detention, it is inconceivable that he could insist on being detained after a court had ordered his release. The law is the law.</p>
      <p>But the Nigerian secret service seems to be propelled by logic from another planet. Here, at length, is how Dr Afunanya wove the strange logic: “There has been outcry about alleged illegal detention of some notable persons undergoing trials at the Courts and disobedience to Court Orders by the Service. To put the records straight, the Service wishes to advert public attention to the circumstances that warranted the custody of Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd.) and Sheik Ibraheem El-Zakzaky in its facility.</p>
      <h3>Read Also: <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/dasuki-el-zakzaky-chose-to-be-in-our-custody-dss/">Dasuki, El-Zakzaky chose to be in our custody- DSS</a></h3>
      <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the duo had appealed to the Courts to be left in the custody of the Service instead of being taken to the Correctional Centres. Well-meaning Nigerians are equally witnesses to the case of Omoleye Sowore, who, on a similar order of the Court, was to be remanded at the Kuje or Suleja Centre, but preferred to be kept at the DSS. Everyone, also, saw what eventually played out with El-Zakzaky, when he opted to be returned to the custody of the Service even as the Court had granted him leave to seek medical care in India.”</p>
      <p>Then he added the clincher: “These were choices these personalities made on their own volition. Since their stay, the Service has continued to extend the best courtesies to them. They are allowed access to people and use of other facilities like telephones, gymnasium, TV, newspapers and medical facilities. Among others, their families and trusted persons bring them food of their choices on a daily basis. There could not have been better treatments than these. Against the wrong perception that the Service held these persons in defiance to Court Orders, it is obvious, by the above explanations, that they rather chose to be looked after by the DSS. The reason for such a choice is not farfetched. It is simply because the Service’s holding facilities are good and within acceptable international standards.”</p>
      <p>Dr Afunanya forgot to tell Nigerians that if the detainees opted for DSS detention facilities, it was because they were faced with a short list of choices between the poorly funded Correctional Service facilities and the DSS. More importantly, the DSS spokesman also forgot to tell probing Nigerians that the courts had ordered these men released, and that these men had even repeatedly but unsuccessfully approached the courts to enforce their release. No amount of lexical and legal subterfuge can conceal the fact that both men had been detained since 2015 and refused release, not at their own instance, nor because they enjoyed the DSS ‘five-star’ detention facility, but at the oppressive instance of the powerful secret service. Even in the case of Omoyele Sowore, leader of the #RevolutionNow movement, the DSS has kept him for cynical reasons. First they said no one came for him after his bail was taken. Then when a platoon of lawyers and family members showed up, the Service insisted only his surety could receive him.</p>
      <p>No, these men’s continued detention has nothing to do with what the courts ordered or what the detainees’ preferences are. The DSS, like many agencies under this government, is simply above the law.</p>
