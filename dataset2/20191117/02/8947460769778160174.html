      <h1>Ford Mustang Mach-E joins the electric SUV segment</h1>
      <h2>So you have decided to go electric – great news, and in buying a BMW i3 you have managed to get one technically sophisticated machine …</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:32:19+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author">Horatiu Boeriu</a></address>
      <p>An unfortunate <a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/discovered-2021-mustang-mach-e-official-page-w-pricing-models-specs-video-etc.49/">leak</a> has given us an early view of one of LA Auto Show’s big reveals – The Ford Mustang Mach-E. According to <a href="https://jalopnik.com/2020-ford-mustang-mach-e-heres-the-car-price-and-0-60-1839875945"><i>Jalopnik</i></a>, the new electric crossover was bound to be unveiled on November 17th, but a web development error allowed for some images and info to be scooped up ahead of time.</p>
      <p>The new crossover is an all-electric car which will arrive in the United States by 2021. The Ford Mustang Mach E is rumored to come in five trims staring at a base price of $43,895, with the most expensive variant priced at $60,500. This puts Ford in the premium segment of electric crossovers, along with the <a href="https://www.quattrodaily.com/world-premiere-audi-q5-55-tfsi-e-quattro-the-first-of-many-to-come/">Audi e-tron Q5</a>, Jaguar i-Pace, Tesla Model S (even though priced higher) and the upcoming <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/08/26/the-new-bmw-ix3-will-first-launch-in-europe-in-2020/">BMW iX3</a>. Many other automakers are expecting to release their own electric crossovers by 2021.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, Jalopnik reports that the Mach-E will be available with a rear- or all-wheel drive, with the former having a range of around 300 miles. Some of the other variants will have an autonomy of 230 to 300 miles.</p>
      <p>When it comes to charging, the Ford Mustang Mach-E seems to employ the latest tech in fast charging allowing it to gain 47 miles of range in just 10 minutes of charge.</p>
      <p>Design wise, the Mustang Mach-E drops the iconic front-grille and now features a smooth front-end, similar to what you’d see on a Tesla Model 3. Inside, the digital system is comprised of two large displays, again, a trait of newly released electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it’s quite interesting to see the transformation of the Mustang brand which, just like many other sports brands before, jumps into the SUV world, but with a twist.</p>
      <p>We expect to learn more tomorrow and we will also bring you live photos of the Ford Mustang Mach-E from the 2019 Los Angeles Motor Show.</p>
