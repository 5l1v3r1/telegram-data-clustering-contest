      <p>The 24-year-old's maternal grandfather Raymond Poulidor, who died aged 83 on Wednesday, is a household name and national hero in France after finishing on the Tour de France podium eight times, winning the hearts of rural France without ever having won the event itself.</p>
      <p>Despite his Tour de France disappointments, Poulidor ranks among France's cycling greats and is seen as a humble hard worker loved by the people who earned every one of his many triumphs.</p>
      <p>The multi-discipline Van der Poel is tipped by many inside the sport to avenge his grandfather and eventually win the Tour de France.</p>
      <p>Poulidor will be given a funeral in his hometown village in rural central France on Wednesday.</p>
