      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. — The Latest on the Louisiana governor’s election (all times local):</p>
      <p>8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Polls have closed in Louisiana, where a runoff election is deciding whether the Deep South’s only Democratic governor can reach a second term despite opposition from President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s competition between Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards and Republican businessman Eddie Rispone is tight. Trump made three visits to Louisiana during the race, trying to keep Edwards from victory.</p>
      <p>The president particularly wants to capture Louisiana’s governorship for Republicans after Democrats ousted a GOP incumbent in Kentucky. Trump has made the race a test of his political prowess amid the Democrats’ impeachment hearings in Washington.</p>
      <p>Edwards ran on state-specific issues, trying to steer clear of national politics.</p>

      <p>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards is battling to defy the partisan odds in the ruby red South and win reelection to a seat that President Donald Trump wants returned to Republicans.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s election has become a nail-biter, with no clear favourite for victory.</p>
      <p>Trump has made the runoff election between the Deep South’s only Democratic governor and GOP businessman Eddie Rispone a test of his own popularity and political prowess.</p>
      <p>The president particularly wants to capture Louisiana’s governorship for the GOP after Democrats ousted a Republican incumbent in Kentucky. Trump made three trips to Louisiana to rally against Edwards.</p>
      <p>But in targeting Louisiana’s moderate Democratic incumbent, the president is trying to replace a governor who still maintains positive approval ratings.</p>
      <p>Polls in Louisiana close at 8 p.m.</p>
