      <p>Brisbane Heat's WBBL title defence has shifted into overdrive as Jess Jonassen and Beth Mooney inspired them to a clinical eight-wicket defeat of Perth Scorchers at Drummoyne Oval in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Jonassen starred with bat (32no) and ball (4-23) while Mooney (60no) continued her magical run at the top of the order to steer the ladder-leading Heat past the Scorchers' modest 8-112 with 23 deliveries to spare on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Mooney, the tournament's top run-scorer (523 at 87.17), held firm as Maddy Green and Sammy-Jo Johnson both departed in the power play to plunder her sixth half-century of a golden summer.</p>
      <p>She found a valuable ally in all-rounder Jonassen and the pair put on an unbroken 79 for the third wicket to make easy work of the run chase, securing Brisbane's fifth-straight victory.</p>
      <p>Player-of-the-match Jonassen capped a memorable weekend with her second four-wicket haul, and her third of the series, to be the leading wicket-taker of the competition with 16 at 13.31.</p>

      <p>The left-arm spinner combined with the reliable Johnson (2-16), who is second behind Jonassen for most wickets, to rip into Perth's top order.</p>
      <p>The loss snapped the Scorchers' three-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>Captain Meg Lanning and import Amy Jones both succumbed in the first three overs before Nat Sciver produced a gutsy 26.</p>
      <p>However, none of Perth's first five batters were able to go at a run-a-ball as they failed to mount any real pressure on the Heat.</p>
