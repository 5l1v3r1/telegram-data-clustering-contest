      <p>Long-time Slashdot reader <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/~theodp">theodp</a> writes: <i>In years past, Microsoft's wildly popular <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/17/11/18/2123214/microsoft-debuts-minecraft-themed-coding-tutorial">Minecraft-themed Hour of Code tutorials</a> were browser-based, pretty much allowing schoolchildren to participate regardless of whether their schools used PCs, Macs or Chromebooks. "Computer science is a foundation for every student," <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/upgradeyourworld/Hourofcode">Microsoft explained</a> on a web page about the Hour of Code, adding that "a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few."<br/><br/>But that was then, and this is now. <br/><br/>"The new Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial," explains a <a href="https://code.org/minecraft">new announcement</a> at Microsoft-sponsored Code.org, "is now available in <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/hour-of-code">Minecraft: Education Edition for Windows, Mac, and iPad</a>." So, when will the Chromebook version be available? Silly Rabbit, the 2019 Minecraft Hour of Code is for Windows and Apple kids! From the <a href="https://minecrafteducation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035852791-Hour-of-Code-Lesson-FAQ">Minecraft 2019 Hour of Code Lesson FAQ</a>:<br/><br/><b>Q.</b> Does the Hour of Code Lesson work on Chromebooks?<br/><br/><b>A.</b> The Hour of Code Lesson is not compatible with Chromebooks. If your class has Chromebooks and would like to do a Minecraft Hour of Code lesson, we recommend using one of the [old] Minecraft tutorials on Code.org." <br/><br/>Yes, but that means <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/u-s-k-12-market-mobile-devices-remains-flat-2-percent-growth-2018/">schoolkids with Chromebooks</a> won't be exposed to the teased <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqMHlQBhZs8">AI for Good concepts</a> introduced in the 2019 Minecraft tutorial, which seems at odds with Microsoft's professed <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2017/01/17/democratizing-ai-satya-nadella-shares-vision-at-dld/">focus on democratizing AI</a> and putting AI developer tools in the hands of "every public sector organization around the world."</i></p>
