      <p>Makeup artist Krissy Vanderwoude caught the attention of Mermaid Straw, a company selling reusable products as an alternative to plastics. Now, they are working together to raise awareness on ocean pollution and keeping the environment clean.<br/><br/>"I think art really has the ability to capture people's minds and capture people's attention," said Adam Harrington, co-founder of Mermaid Straw. "Krissy's mermaid, this is a perfect representation to bring awareness to a topic that some people may not think about."<br/><br/><br/>Harrington said their company helps people "take small steps toward helping save our oceans, our lakes, our rivers from plastic pollution."</p>
