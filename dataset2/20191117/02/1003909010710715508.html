      <h1>Dinos down Marauders, book ticket to another Vanier Cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:02:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:02</time> by <a rel="author">Rita Mingo, For the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>As a team-bonding exercise, the Calgary football Dinos coloured their respective heads blond.</p>
      <p>Like they always say, a team that colours its hair together wins together.</p>
      <p>“It’s got to stay now, for sure,” laughed Dinos linebacker Grant McDonald, who enjoyed one of several starring roles in the Dinos’ 30-17 Mitchell Bowl victory over the McMaster Marauders Saturday afternoon at McMahon Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Dinos now advance to their 11th Vanier Cup appearance and first since 2016 as they head to Quebec City  to take on Montreal next Saturday. The Carabins handily defeated the host Acadia Axemen 38-0 in the other national semifinal, the Uteck Bowl, on Saturday in Wolfville, N.S.</p>
      <p>“They’ve worked all season to get to this spot,” said a proud Dinos head coach Wayne Harris Jr. “They get the opportunity now to go for the championship prize and that’s what every team wants.</p>
      <p>“My work resumes here in a short while and we’ll start getting ready for Montreal. We’re happy to be there but we’re not satisfied yet.”</p>
      <p>The Marauders, third in the U Sports rankings, gave it their best, but on this day a more complete effort by Calgary did them in.</p>

      <p>“Championship team across the other sideline,” praised McMaster head coach Stefan Ptaszek. “They played great football. We hung in. We weren’t one play away; we were several.</p>
      <p>“Calgary’s a good football team. They have so many playmakers on that offence. They’re going to be a handful. I wish them well in the Vanier Cup.”</p>
      <p>Calgary quarterback Adam Sinagra was 19-of-29 for 261 yards, but was hounded all game by a physical McMaster D-line and sacked three times. Nonetheless, he was able to utilize his weapons to their best advantage. Running back Robinson Rodrigues ran for 125 yards, while Jalen Philpot was the offensive player of the game as he caught seven passes for 170 yards.</p>
      <p>“We knew it was going to be back and forth,” Philpot said. “We were able to score some points and get the W. It’s amazing. We knew from the get-go that we wanted it and we were going to have to battle these guys.”</p>
      <p>Calgary struck first, with Sinagra tossing a seven-yard touchdown pass to Philpot. But a blocked Niko DiFonte kick late in the first quarter led to a successful Marauders’ response. In a penalty-aided short drive, McMaster’s Jordan Lyons scooted in from two yards out to tie the game early in the second.</p>
      <p>Midway through the quarter, the Calgary offence marched down the field and a one-yard plunge by backup QB Josiah Joseph put the home side up by seven once again.</p>
      <p>The Dinos hoped to add to their total late in the half, when Philpot returned a punt more than 100 yards into the end zone, but it was agonizingly called back due to a holding penalty.</p>
      <p>In the second half, kudos had to go to both defences, which tightened up considerably and made for tough sledding for the attacking teams as drive after drive was stunted.</p>
      <p>“We knew coming in that they have a very good defence and we’ve been depending on our defence all year as well,” explained Harris. “So I’m not surprised it was really some shut-down stuff on both sides of the ball. It was a big battle trying to get the ball in the end zone.”</p>

      <p>A third-quarter Niko DiFonte field goal gave Calgary a 10-point advantage and the Dinos held on to that with their fingernails.</p>
      <p>In the fourth, a 64-yard pass-and-run play from Sinagra to Tyson Philpot ignited an end-to-end drive, which concluded with a two-yard toss from Joseph to the linebacker McDonald in the end zone. That drove the nails into the old coffin.</p>
      <p>“That was something that coach had in his back pocket that we were waiting to use,” grinned McDonald, who had 6.5 tackles in the game. “It was a pretty cool feeling for my first U Sports touchdown.</p>
      <p>“Our coaches always say you have to turn the page, you have to have a short memory,” he continued. “That was a good win. We’ll celebrate it tonight then we’re back to work tomorrow. Off to Quebec City and preparing for the Vanier Cup.”</p>
      <p>Calgary yielded a last-minute touchdown to McMaster when Tommy Nield — who was excellent in finishing with 151 yards receiving — caught a two-yarder from his quarterback Andreas Dueck, who completed 23-of-46 passes for 297 yards.</p>
      <p>“We have the best defence in the country,” opined Sinagra, who will be vying for the Vanier Cup just three hours from his hometown of Pointe Claire, Que. “Montreal’s going to be great, but we play such good complementary football on all three phases of the ball and I’m so proud of these guys. They never gave up. It’s not always going to be pretty; it’s how you respond.</p>
      <p>“What you work for all off-season is to get a shot at the Vanier Cup. We’ve done that and now it’s about doing our job and hoisting it.”</p>
