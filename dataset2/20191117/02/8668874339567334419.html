      <h1>Embarrassed Harlequins' fans not sold on Gustard's promise after 'too many soft losses'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T02:33:08+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 02:33</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>With just one win from their opening four Premiership starts, Harlequins opened their European campaign with a 53-21 humbling at the hands of French superpower Clermont. The two sides met last year in the Challenge Cup semi-final, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont">Clermont</a> prevailing 32-27.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> dropped to their third consecutive loss this season, Director of Rugby Paul Gustard vowed to ‘get things right’ as their season drifts towards the precipice.</p>
      <p>“We have to look at how we can rejuvenate the team, how we can maybe affect it through selection, how we train, how we look after the players, how we recover and the environment we create,” he said following the match.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been in this position before as a coach and it’s hurting, but I’ll get it right.</p>
      <p>His confidence wasn’t backed up by fans however, who were ’embarrassed’ at another ‘soft loss’ in a ‘gutless performance’.</p>

      <p>Fans on social media questioned the effort and commitment of the side, claiming that serious change is required to save the season. With patience running thin, many called for the resignation of head coach Gustard.</p>
      <p>Gustard took over Harlequins in 2018 and after a slow start took the side to the brink of the Premiership playoffs, with the side placing 5th and just missing out after a last-minute penalty in the final round denied a playoff-birth.</p>
      <p>The result was their best since the 2013/14 season while turning around a leaky defence that gave up the third most tries in 2017/18 to the fourth-least while the side managed a semi-final performance in the Challenge Cup.</p>
