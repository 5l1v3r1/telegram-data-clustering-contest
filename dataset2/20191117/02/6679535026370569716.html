      <p>It is hard to conclude anything other than our criticisms of the Chinese Communist Party has resulted in us not being welcome, Mr. Paterson told on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It is concerning China feels that people who have been publicly critical of the Chinese Communist Party are not welcome to visit and learn from China,he added.</p>
      <p>The Chinese Embassy in Australia issued a statement saying he Chinese people do not welcome those who make unwarranted attacks, want only (to) exert pressure on China, challenge China’s sovereignty, disrespect China’s dignity and undermine mutual trust between China and Australia</p>
      <p>As long as the people concerned genuinely repent and redress their mistakes, view China with objectivity and reason, respect China’s system and mode of development chosen by the Chinese people, the door of dialogue and exchanges will always remain open,the embassy spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Resource-rich Australia relies on China for one-third of its export earnings, but relations have been frosty with accusations of the Chinese Communist Party meddling in Australia democratic system.</p>
      <p>Mr. Paterson, a member of the conservative Liberal Party representing Victoria, denied the Complex relationship with China had hit a nadir.</p>
      <p>If it really value Australia relationship with China. There are very positive aspects but there are difficult aspects too because we do have different value systems,he said.</p>
      <p>Both backbenchers so the things we say are not necessarily the views of the government and that clear,he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Paterson said it was unlikely the study tour could be rescheduled.</p>
      <p>It is disappointing because it would have been an opportunity for good-faith dialogue,he said. won be discouraged or deterred from speaking out on these issues.</p>
