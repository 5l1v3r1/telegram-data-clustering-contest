      <h2>Dutch university lets students lie inside pit to reconcile with mortality</h2>

      <p>A university in the Netherlands has come up with a unique way for students to contemplate life and death. Lie in a grave. Radboud University in the Dutch city of Nijmegen has a grave located behind the school's chapel and students can book sessions to lie it in and meditate. The idea behind getting students to sign up for the experience, it to help them reflect about life and what is important. "A modern form of memento mori, which means that you are aware that you are mortal," the University website shared. "It's an invitation along the lines of: make something out of your life."</p>

      <p>Telephones and books are prohibited. A pillow and mat are provided to students, who reportedly can use the grave for between 30 minutes and three hours. The university had earlier carried out a similar project from 2009 to 2011. The project was started by school chaplain John Hacking. "The end of life and death, is a taboo; difficult for students to talk about. Especially when you are 18, 19 and 20 years old," he told news outlet Ruptly.</p>
