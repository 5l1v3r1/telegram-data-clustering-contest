      <p>Cypriot police said Saturday they had seized an alleged "spy van" equipped with sophisticated surveillance equipment capable of hacking communications and questioned its Israeli owner.</p>
      <p>Police began investigating after the opposition communist party AKEL asked what the government was doing about activities undertaken in the van, which was showcased in a <i>Forbes </i>video story broadcast several months ago that only recently went viral in Cyprus.</p>
      <p>Cyprus police chief Kypros Michaelides told private radio station <i>Astra </i>that the Israeli owner had given "some explanations", but he would be questioned further, along with Cypriot nationals.</p>
      <p><i>Forbes</i> had named the owner of the van as ex-Israeli intelligence officer Tal Dilian, who allegedly heads a Cyprus-registered company that owns the vehicle.</p>
      <p>It said the $9 million state-of-the-art equipment in the van can monitor electronic devices within a 500-metre (yards) radius, hack any phone and listen in to conversations regardless of the level of encryption.</p>
      <p>Investigators searched a company premises where the van was located in the southern coastal resort of Larnaca after securing warrants, Cypriot police said.</p>
      <p>"On preliminary examination, the vehicle was found to have electronic equipment and was confiscated, along with other evidence," a police statement said Saturday.</p>
      <p>"In a subsequent investigation at the company's offices, further evidence was found, which will be subject to scientific examination," it added.</p>
      <p>Police said they were investigating possible violations of the protection of privacy law.</p>
      <p>Once the video of the van gathered online momentum on the island, the government was urged to act to see if anything illegal had transpired.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Israel's police said it had not been notified by Cypriot counterparts of the case.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from Israel's foreign ministry.</p>
