      <p>Prince Andrew came clean about his friendship with US paedophile Jeffrey Epstein in an explosive interview with the BBC on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>In the shock TV interview, the Duke of York, 59, admitted he "kicks" himself for keeping in contact with the American financier after his first conviction in 2008.</p>
      <p>Speaking inside Buckingham Palace, he told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50431163"><i>BBC</i> reporter Emily Maitlis</a>: “That's the bit that… as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."</p>

      <p>And when asked why he chose to stay at Jeffrey's home, the prince said: "It was a convenient place to stay. I mean I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do."</p>
      <p>Andrew continued, "But at the time I felt it was the honorable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honorable but that's just the way it is."</p>
      <p>The royal also insisted he has "no recollection" of meeting Virginia Roberts, the woman who claims they had sex on three separate occasions.</p>

      <p>Rumors have swirled around Prince Andrew and his friendship with the businessman for years. Speculation hit its highest after footage emerged showing the prince inside Epstein’s mansion in 2010—two years after Epstein was first convicted.</p>
      <p>After the footage came out, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying, “The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged crimes. His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”</p>
      <p>On July 6 2019, Epstein, 66, was arrested on criminal charges for sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York. He was charged on July 8 with sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex. He was found hanged in jail while awaiting trial in August.</p>
