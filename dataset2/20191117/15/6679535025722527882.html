      <h1>Chinese data show details of Xinjiang clampdown</h1>
      <h2>1 mn from minority groups detained</h2>

      <p>A trove of leaked Chinese government documents reveals details of its clampdown on Uighurs and other Muslims in the country’s western Xinjiang region under President Xi Jinping, the <i>New York Times</i> reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>United Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.</p>
      <p>The documents show how Mr. Xi gave a series of internal speeches to officials during and after a 2014 visit to Xinjiang following a stabbing attack by Uighur militants at a train station that killed 31 people.</p>
      <p>The report said Xi called for an “all-out ‘struggle against terrorism, infiltration, and separatism’ using the ‘organs of dictatorship,’ and showing ‘absolutely no mercy’.” The documents show that the Chinese leadership’s fears were heightened by terrorist attacks in other countries and the U.S. drawdown of troops from Afghanistan.</p>
