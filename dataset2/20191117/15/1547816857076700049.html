        <b>A biopic on the life of Madhubala is being planned with Imtiaz Ali coming aboard as the director. We asked Amit Kumar as to how he feels about the biopic on the late actress’ life</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reportedly, Imtiaz Ali is planning a biopic being planned on the life of (late Madhubala). The Rockstar director has apparently acquired the rights for the same by signing a Life Story Rights Assignment Agreement with the actress’ family. The biopic, which will narrate the actress’ journey from her debut performance as a child artiste in Basant, has become the talk of the industry.</p>
      <p>This time is right to ask Amit Kumar (son of Kishore Kumar and Ruma Guha Thakurta) about how he feels about this biopic. Madhubala was Kishore Kumar's second wife. We called Amit Kumar, this afternoon.</p>

      <p>Said Amit Kumar, "I have absolutely no problem. It will be a joy to see Madhubala's biopic. She was the most beautiful woman."</p>
      <p>Amit Kumar soon travelled back in time and recalled his childhood memories with Madhubala, "I used to come down for vacations from Kolkata where I was studying. I was just 9 years old then. My dad had rented a flat. Dad, Madhubala and I used to live there at times. Then, sometimes, I used to stay at the Juhu bungalow too.” Amit Kumar added that he shared a very normal  equation with his Madhubala and there was no awkwardness between us.</p>
