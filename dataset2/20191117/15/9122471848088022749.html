      <h1>Danny Kanell Posts His New Top 8 After Week 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:21:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>College football analyst Danny Kanell has updated his personal rankings following Week 12 of the 2019 regular season. As always, they’re a bit controversial.</p>
      <p>Kanell continues to not have LSU ranked No. 1, despite the Tigers’ undefeated record and big win at Alabama. Ohio State isn’t No. 1, either, despite the Buckeyes’ dominance.</p>
      <p>Clemson is No. 1. Kanell says he’ll continue to have Clemson at No. 1 as long as they’re undefeated because they’re the reigning national champions.</p>
      <p>That’s a bit ridiculous, but hey, it’s his poll.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full top eight:</p>

      <p>The official new top 25 polls will come out at 12 p.m. E.T. (Coaches’ Poll) and 2 p.m. E.T. (AP Poll).</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings are out on Tuesday night.</p>
