      <p>Students at an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/arkansas">Arkansas</a> college suspect a campus chemistry lab was turned into a meth lab after the arrest of two professors, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Henderson State University <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/whoa-enormous-cotton-candy-explosion-in-kids-chemistry-lab">chemistry</a> professors Terry Bateman, 45, and Bradley Rowland, 40, were charged Friday with the manufacture of methamphetamine and the use of drug paraphernalia, Fox 16 Little Rock reported.</p>
      <p>Students suspected meth may have been involved when a chemical spill closed the college’s science building in October for three weeks, <a href="https://www.fox16.com/news/local-news/2-henderson-state-university-professors-arrested-on-meth-drug-charges-clark-co-sheriffs-office-says/">the station reported</a>.</p>
