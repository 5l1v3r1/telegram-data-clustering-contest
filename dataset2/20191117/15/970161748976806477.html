      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sinitta/">Sinitta</a> smiled it out after taking a tumble while leaving the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> studios last night… and honestly, what else can you do but laugh?</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old So Macho singer was leaving the studio after the latest <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor: Celebrity live show</a> wearing a Loius Vuitton scarf, high-waisted purple skinny jeans, brown coat with fur collar and adorable dog Scarlett O’Hara in tow.</p>
      <p>She must’ve lost her balance in the platform black boots she was wearing as the next thing she knew, she was hitting the cold, hard floor.</p>
      <p>The trip may have knocked her down, but it didn’t knock her positive attitude, as she smiled and laughed while lying on her back.</p>
      <p>A friend then kindly offered to help her up.</p>

      <p>It looked like Sinitta wasn’t hurt in the ordeal, but it’s unclear if fur baby Scarlett left the scene unscathed.</p>

      <p>Let’s just hope they managed to pick themselves up and dust themselves off.</p>
      <p>Sinitta made headlines earlier this month when she surprised ex-boyfriend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/sinitta-surprises-simon-cowell-60th-birthday-cake-shape-hairy-torso-kind-gross-11033682/">Simon Cowell with a cake celebrating his 60th birthday</a> when she hilariously brought Simon a huge treat in the shape of his own hairy torso.</p>

      <p>Last night’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/left-x-factor-celebrity-fourth-live-show-11169786/">X Factor</a> had been a tough one for Simon after Vinnie Jones pleaded with him to save Kevin McHale and send himself home in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>‘Simon…I feel that I’ve had a fantastic time, I’ve really enjoyed it – it’s been everything I’ve needed since my wife’s passing,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘This guy is a real singer, I think he can win it, for his career, I would like to step down and let him go through.’</p>
      <p>But Simon decided: ‘The last person in the world I would like to have a fall out with is Vinnie Jones, which means we’re going to have to fall out because I’m going to insist that you stay in the competition.</p>
      <p>‘This is not disrespect to Kevin, I am voting with my heart…I think you have a chance of winning this competition still,’ he added.</p>
