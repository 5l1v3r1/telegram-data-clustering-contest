      <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday backed petrol price increases that have sparked protests across Iran, blaming opponents of the Islamic Republic and foreign enemies for “sabotage”, State television reported.</p>
      <p>“Some people are no doubt worried by this decision... but sabotage and arson is done by hooligans not our people. The counter-revolution and Iran’s enemies have always supported sabotage and breaches of security and continue to do so,” Mr. Khamenei said.</p>
      <p>Riot police and security forces clashed with demonstrators on Saturday in Tehran and dozens of cities across the country, .</p>
      <p>Internet access in Iran was curbed after the protests at the order of a state security council, the semi-official news agency ISNA reported.</p>
      <p>Mr. Khamenei said the increase in gasoline prices was based on expert opinion and should be implemented.</p>
      <p>The price of petrol was raised to 15,000 rials ($0.13) a litre from 10,000 rials and rationed. Additional purchases would cost 30,000 rials per litre.</p>
