        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has stirred all kinds of nostalgia for the summer with his sweet new track Watermelon Sugar, which could easily have been a bop for the warmer months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Served up in November instead, the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> singer dropped the latest song from his forthcoming album Fine Line just <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/harry-styles-throws-shade-zayn-malik-thanking-simon-cowell-growing-one-direction-test-tubes-11169548/">hours after co-hosting Saturday Night Live</a>.</p>
      <p>Watermelon Sugar sees Harry, 25, lusting after a former love with lyrics including: ‘Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin’, and it sounds just like a song / I want more berries and that summer feelin’, It’s so wonderful and warm.’</p>
      <p>If he had to summarise his long-lost love in a month, it would be June, apparently.</p>
      <p>Harry had teased Watermelon Sugar last month with a tweet in reference to the track Kiwi from his self-titled debut album, writing: ‘Kiwi walked so Watermelon Sugar could run.’</p>

      <p>Kiwi, Watermelon… we’re getting the sense that Harry really loves his five-a-day.</p>
      <p>Harry delivered the first live performance of Watermelon Sugar during his SNL hosting stint last night, rocking out with a live band in a snazzy red suit.</p>

      <p>It’s safe to say the Watermelon went down a treat with fans after it blessed their ears, with one tweeting: ‘Harry styles performing watermelon sugar is the greatest gift of this generation and if you disagree then you have no rights.’</p>
      <p>Wowza.</p>
      <p>Appreciating Harry on all levels, another agreed: ‘Okay but harry styles performing watermelon sugar in this red suit is the highest level of hotness.’</p>
      <p>One fan predicted: ‘“Watermelon Sugar” = the latest indication that Harry Styles’ second album will be the sound of him having an absolute blast.’</p>
      <p>Watermelon Sugar follows hot on the heels of the lead single from Fine Line, Light Up, a soulful vibe which has also been well-received by fans.</p>

      <p>Harry’s stint on SNL was certainly entertaining with the popstar throwing shade at his former 1D bandmate Zayn Malik before thanking Simon Cowell for ‘growing One Direction in test tubes’.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t know if you heard or not, I’m not in a boyband anymore. I’m in a man band now,’ Harry said in his skit.</p>
      <p>‘I was in a band called One Direction, how crazy would it be if they were here tonight? Well, they’re not. Wouldn’t it be crazy if they were though? They’re not.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I love those guys, they’re my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis… and Ringo. Yeah, that’s it.’</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
      <p>The popstar then quipped: ‘I’m just so grateful Simon Cowell grew us in those test tubes.’</p>

        <i>Harry Styles’ second album Fine Line is set for release on 13 December.</i>
