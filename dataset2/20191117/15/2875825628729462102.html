      <p>Sarah Ferguson used thousands of pounds supplied by convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to pay off debt - and said she "abhor[red] sexual abuse of children".</p>
      <p>The Duchess of York struck a deal with the disgraced financier, which came to light in 2011 after he had already spent time behind bars for soliciting a 14-year-old girl for prostituted sex.</p>
      <p>Epstein, who was found dead in a jail cell in August this year, had paid £15,000 to Sarah's former personal assistant Johnny O'Sullivan to cover part of his unpaid salary.</p>
      <p>At the time, Sarah was some £5million in debt and owed her ex-PA £78,000 in wages and bills, but was able to restructure her debts after he agreed to take the £15,000.</p>

      <p>The duchess, who shares two adult daughters - Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie - with ex-husband Prince Andrew, told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/duchess-of-york-apologises-for-gigantic-error-of-judgement-over-debt-6574623.html">Evening Standard</a> when the scandal broke: "I deeply regret Jeffrey Epstein became involved in any way with me.</p>
      <p>"I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf."</p>
      <p>She went on: "I am just so contrite I cannot say. Whenever I can I will repay the money and will have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.</p>
      <p>"What he did was wrong and for which he was rightly jailed.</p>
      <p>"This is the first time ever in my life, and I mean 'ever', that I have been debt-free. It allows me to go forward to do what I do, being a good mother, a philanthropist for children and also an author of children's books.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I had no idea of the string of other allegations and court cases against him and I am distraught that I should have allowed myself to get out of debt with any help from him when my judgment was clouded."</p>
      <p>In her same interview, Sarah paid tribute to "the man I must admire in the world: the duke", hailing him as "a first-rate father... a first-rate man".</p>
      <p>"I would throw myself under a bus for him," she went on.</p>
      <p>"The duke is a man who does not know how to tell an untruth or behave dishonourably. There have been errors of judgment but nothing substantive has been done wrong by him, ever."</p>
      <p>It was claimed by a source close to the Royal family at the time that Andrew had interceded on his ex-wife's behalf to request the money from his friend.</p>
      <p>Sarah had not been in contact directly with the financier, which she claimed allowed her to believe her £15,000 deal was innocent.</p>

      <p>But after her 2011 statement, Epstein hired a team of lawyers to sue the duchess and was said to be incensed by her suggestion he was a paedophile - despite having already been convicted of sexual offences against an underage girl.</p>
      <p>He engaged the services of a crisis management team in 2011, and the firm's meticulously detailed files showed a reference on March 15 2011 to "work on statement for Fergie".</p>
      <p>That statement, a source close to the duchess said, was one drafted on Epstein's orders that he wanted her to release.</p>
      <p>However, pals told the Daily Mail Sarah stayed strong and refused to comply with his threats, resulting in him eventually dropping the legal action.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fergie left the country ahead of Andrew's car-crash TV interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he denied having sex with the then-17-year-old Virginia Roberts because he had a medical condition that meant he couldn't sweat.</p>

      <p>During the nail-bitingly awful 60-minute interview, the third of the Queen's four children failed to condemn his friendship with Epstein and said he had to visit the disgraced man's New York home to break up their relationship in person.</p>
      <p>Sarah took to Instagram to gush over her ex-husband once again ahead of the BBC2 programme airing.</p>
      <p>"It is so rare to meet people that are able to speak from their hearts with honesty and pure real truth, that remain steadfast and strong to their beliefs," she wrote in her caption.</p>
      <p>"Andrew is a true and real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness and goodness of always seeing the best in people. I am deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man, that dares to put his shoulder to the wind and stands firm with his sense of honour and truth."</p>
      <p>She continued: "For so many years he has gone about his duties for Great Britain and The Monarch. It is time for Andrew to stand firm now, and that he has, and I am with him every step of the way and that is my honour.</p>
      <p>"We have always walked tall and strong, he for me and me for him. We are the best examples of joint parenting, with both our girls and I go back to my three C's ..Communicate, Compromise, Compassion."</p>
