      <h1>SN college football rankings Week 13: Oklahoma comeback saves Sooners' Playoff hopes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:01:56+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>Another week of college football has concluded, and it has provided us with perhaps the clearest picture yet of the eventual College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>That starts with Alabama, which entering Week 12 still looked to have an outside chance at making the Playoff. But a season-ending hip injury to quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, however, seems to have ended the Crimson Tide's hopes at a sixth straight Playoff berth, even after their win over Mississippi State.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Other significant games include losses by previously unbeaten teams Minnesota and Baylor, which lost to Iowa and Oklahoma, respectively. The chalk held in most other matchups, with undefeateds LSU, Ohio State and Clemson all winning; the same held true for one-loss teams in Georgia, Oregon, Utah and Penn State.</p>
      <p>With that, SN's college football rankings ahead of the Week 13 slate of games:</p>
