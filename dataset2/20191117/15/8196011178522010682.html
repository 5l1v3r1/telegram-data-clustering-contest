      <p>Desperate members of a lifeboat crew tried to save the life of a colleague whose car slipped into the sea in a freak accident off the coast of Donegal.</p>
      <p>The victim has been named locally as Lee Early, a 26-year-old single man from Arranmore Island.</p>
      <p>The tightly-knit island community, which has a population of around 450 people, are grieving today following the freak accident which claimed Lee's life.</p>
      <p>Another man in his 30s was lucky to escape after the men's car went into the sea at Poolawaddy Pier just after 5am this morning (Sun).</p>
      <p>It has since been revealed that Mr Early, who worked on the Arranmore Ferry, was also a volunteer on the island's RNLI lifeboat.</p>
      <p>Indeed his father Jimmy is the coxswain on the local lifeboat.</p>
      <p>Members of the lifeboat crew, whose station is close to the scene of the tragedy, rushed to save Mr Early and his friend after their car entered the water.</p>
      <p>The passenger managed to swim free but Lee died at the scene despite the heroic efforts of the lifeboat crew members to resuscitate him.</p>
      <p>RNLI area life-saving manager for Ireland, Owen Medland, said Lee's death would be a huge loss to the island.</p>
      <p>“The deceased was one of our volunteers and was very close to us. He was a super young man who would be a loss to any community never mind a small community,” he said.</p>
      <p>“As an organisation, our thoughts are with the family, our volunteer crew who fought valiantly to save the young man’s life, and the wider Arranmore community.</p>
      <p>“We would like to assure the community that after what appears was a tragic accident, we are maintaining our lifeboat service on the island which is further testimony to the crew in Arranmore.”</p>
      <p>Local Donegal TD Pat the Cope Gallagher said he was shocked by the new of Lee's death.</p>
      <p>He said he knew the family whom he described as "true islanders" and there was a great sense of loss as a result of Lee's death.</p>
      <p>"A sense of deep shock descended on the island when news broke of the tragic death of Lee.</p>
      <p>"He was a highly-regarded, hard-working and popular young man from a well-respected island family.</p>
      <p>"Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time," he said.</p>
      <p>A full Garda investigation into the tragedy has commenced.</p>
      <p>The investigation will probe how the men's car ended up in the sea off the pier which is at the rear of the island.</p>
      <p>A post mortem on the late Mr Early will be carried out tomorrow (Mon) at Letterkenny University Hospital to determine an official cause of death.</p>
      <p>His family, including father Jimmy, mother Noreen, brother Adam and sisters Rachel and Laura are being comforted by family and friends on the island.</p>
      <p>The island has been at the centre of a huge campaign aimed at persuading people from around the world to live there.</p>
      <p>Locals even wrote letters to families around the globe in America and Australia telling them of the benefits of coming to live on the island.</p>
      <p>The island, which rests 5 kms off the coast of Donegal has its own health centre, community centre, three schools and even a digital hub.</p>
      <p>The hub was set up in conjunction with telecoms giant Three and offers super-speed broadband for people wishing to set up businesses on the island or who want to base themselves there.</p>
