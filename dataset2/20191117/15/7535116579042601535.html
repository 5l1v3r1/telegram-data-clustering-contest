      <p>While the world is more focused on the fires raging in the Amazon, much less or no attention however is given to worse ones taking place in Africa.</p>
      <p>Wildfires raging across Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to NASAâ€™s Fire Information for Resource Management Map (FIRMS), at least 6,092 fires are happening in Angola whilst 3,395 fires burn in Congo.</p>
      <p>In comparison Brazil only experiences 2,127 fires.</p>
      <p>With little attention given, here is a video of how dire the situation in Africa is.</p>

      <p>It is important to note that wildfires are a big thing and is causing global concern â€“ as it impacts global heating.</p>
      <p>In the video, the narrator mentions that it is time for Africa to write its own stories in order to ensure that its problems are known to the world.</p>

      <p>According to the<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-crisis-amazon-fires-brazil-congo-rainforest-africa-bolsonaro-nasa-macron-a9080741.html"> Independent,</a> farmers in Africa are partly responsible for the fires as they create purpose-lit fires to maintain rich soils for burning, a technique that has been used for thousands of years â€“ similar to the reasons that attribute the Amazon forest fires.</p>
      <p>Surely, anything that harms the environment will do no good to mother nature. Though many understand that forest fire is synonymous with disaster, we believe that more should be done to ensure that that understanding is translated into action.</p>
