      <p>EAGLE MOUNTAIN, Utah (AP) — A Utah high school student who lost both her parents to heart attacks has been nominated for a prestigious scholarship on the strength of her idea for a CPR-assistance device.</p>
      <p>Kennedy Hall’s idea is to create a device that fits over a person’s nose and mouth and do artificial breaths for a person, the Daily Herald in Provo <a href="https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/education/precollegiate/after-losing-both-parents-cedar-valley-student-plans-idea-to/article_3b5bf2e1-8a66-5aa7-8b62-6196858af5a9.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Hall said a machine like she’s envisioning might have helped her parents, who died after a lack of oxygen caused brain damage.</p>
      <p>“Many people have the basic idea of CPR, but don’t know what they are doing,” Hall said.</p>
      <p>She said her parents’ deaths made her hyper aware of what’s going on around her and prompted her to think about ideas to help others.</p>
      <p>“If a device like this had been made at the time, I am wondering how much of a difference it would have made for them, if they would still be here, or how much of a bigger chance that they would have had,” Hall said. “So if something like this was created, it would make a huge difference, I think, in the CPR world and in the medical world.”</p>
      <p>Hall is a senior at Cedar Valley High School in Eagle Mountain. She was chosen as the school’s nominee for the Career and Technical Education Presidential Scholarship Award.</p>
      <p>She hopes to attend Utah State University and become a trauma surgeon.</p>
      <p>Brigitte Reall, a specialist at the school’s Career and Technical Education program, said she is impressed by Hall’s strength after losing both of her parents.</p>
      <p>“She wants to help, to turn it around and make awareness of these issues that we have with CPR,” Reall said.</p>
