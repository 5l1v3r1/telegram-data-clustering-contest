      <p>Nicole Scherzinger has been slammed by fans who accused her of ‘motorboating’ an unsuspecting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/louis-walsh/">Louis Walsh</a> on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> last night.</p>
      <p>The two X Factor: Celebrity judges were celebrating when Nicole grabbed Louis’ head and pressed it against her chest.</p>
      <p>Wearing a strapless, black dress, as she let go she then did a little shimmy by his head.</p>
      <p>In all honesty, no one on the judging panel looked uncomfortable by it – with Simon Cowell just chilling behind the pair, living in the moment.</p>

      <p>Of course, we shouldn’t judge an act by how ‘comfortable’ people appear, though, should we?</p>

      <p>Naturally, the world clutched their pearls as they called out the Pussycat Dolls star for the act – angry because she’s on ‘a family show’ while also pointing out the riot should the gender roles be reversed.</p>
      <p>‘Nicole rubbing her tits in Louis face and jiggling them, imagine if he’d done that with his crotch to her face!!’ a viewer seethed on Twitter, following the show.</p>

      <p>Another chimed in with a thought about Nicole’s moment after musing on the results of the show, as they wrote: ‘When you “save” your mate over talent then yes the public will lose faith. And Nicole shoving her boobs in Louis Walsh’s face? It’s a family show! seriously?’</p>
      <p>One angry fan turned off the telly due to it, as they wrote: ‘I switched off after Nicole’s usual “it’s all about me” pathetic antics this time shoving Louis head into her tits on a family show…’</p>
      <p>Tell us how you really feel, mate!</p>

      <p>One fan got super passionate as they riffed on the ‘imagine if the roles were reversed’ beat: ‘Nobody bats an eyelid at Nicole forcibly motorboating a fellow judge. Just imagine the furore if a male judge thrust his schnangus into her face. It would be career ending. #CelebrityXFactor.’</p>
      <p>It’s clear Nicole is just very, very exciting about…something.</p>
      <p>Might it have something to do with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/nicole-scherzinger-x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-secretly-dating-weeks-texting-11170165/">chatters she’s dating Thom Evans</a>?</p>

      <p>The 41-year-old Pussycat Dolls singer and the 34-year-old rugby star spent a romantic evening together according to reports, with insiders claiming that the pair flirted for weeks before the Try Star member plucked up the courage to ask her out.</p>
      <p>‘Thom is completely Nicole’s type,’ a source revealed. ‘And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world.</p>
      <p>‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.’</p>
      <p>The insider continued to The Sun: ‘And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner.’</p>

      <p>It’s been a flirty season for the singer after she was seriously excited to see Thom and his fellow heartthrobs with their torsos out as they entered the stage with their shirts unbuttoned.</p>
      <p>‘Hello, who do we have here?’ the panelist purred.</p>
      <p>‘I’m really excited about this,’ Simon Cowell grinned, but that was nothing on his co-judge.</p>
      <p>‘Me too, I’m also excited about this shirt right now. How it just hangs, freely and openly… and your chesticles,’ she gasped.</p>
      <p>But after Nicole’s on-off romance with Lewis Hamilton and relationship with tennis hero Grigor, Simon jumped in: ’Not another sport’s star…’</p>
