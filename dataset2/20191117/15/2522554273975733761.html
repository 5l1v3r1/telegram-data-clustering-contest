      <h1>Lil Reese Wants $1 Million for Interview Following Shooting, Posts Photo of Wound</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:52:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/cvernoncoleman/" target="_blank">C. Vernon Coleman II</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/lil-reese/">Lil Reese</a> recently survived a scary ordeal, after being <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/lil-reese-shot-critical-condition/">shot in Chicago last week</a>. Now he wants nothing short of $1 million to tell his harrowing life story in an interview.</p>
      <p>Reese was <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/lil-reese-released-hospital-shot/">released from the hospital</a> on Friday (Nov. 15), after spending five days recovering. He broke his silence on Twitter on Saturday night (Nov. 16) when a follower told the rapper, "Vlad gonna try to get that lil reese interview by any means," referring to DJ Vlad.</p>
      <p>Reese responded that Vlad would have to pay a hefty price for his story, which he claims is more entertaining than some of the biggest artists in hip-hop.</p>
      <p>"Tell [Vlad] I need a million for this story this shit ain‚Äôt fake or free shit bigger then 50 rick Ross and whoever els," Reese replied.</p>
      <p>Vlad caught wind of the post and shot down the offer.</p>
      <p>"Very happy that you survived that shooting," Vlad responded. "But nobody's going to pay you even 1% of $1 million for that interview."</p>

      <p>As previously reported, Reese was shot while sitting in traffic in the Chicago suburb of Country Club Hills at Pulaski Road and 167th Street. Witnesses say Reese was chased by another man in a vehicle who fired 12 shots at the rapper from a mini rifle before fleeing the scene in a Malibu with tinted windows.</p>
      <p>When police arrived at the scene, someone had already driven the rapper to South Suburban Hospital. He was transferred to Advocate Christ Medical Center. Reese was initially listed in critical condition after reportedly being shot in the neck. He has recovered enough to be released from the hospital and is at home on the mend.</p>
      <p>On Sunday (Nov. 17), the rapper shared a photo of his gunshot wound on Instagram. The photo confirms Reese was shot in the neck area, as it shows the rapper with at least a dozen staples holding this throat closed.</p>
      <p>"Made 4 it Lifes a gamble I got hella luck üñ§," he captioned the pic.</p>

      <h3>50 Cent</h3>
      <p>In an instance of violence that would prove to be a staple of modern hip-hop folklore, 50 Cent was shot nine times while sitting in the driveway of his grandmother's house in Southside, Jamaica Queens on May 24, 2000. Fif was hit in his hand, both of his legs, his arm, his chest and the left side of his face, but he managed to survive. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

      <h3>Beanie Sigel</h3>
      <p>On Dec. 5, 2014, Beanie Sigel was shot in the stomach after being involved in a scuffle outside of his home in Pleasantville, N.J Although it was reported that the former Roc-A-Fella MC had to have a lung removed, it actually collapsed and doctors were able to re-inflate it. Beanie would make his triumphant return to the public eye during Meek Mill's homecoming concert in Philly on March 21, 2015. "You can't kill me," he told reporters after he stepped off the stage. Long live Beanie.</p>

      <h3>Cam'ron</h3>
      <p>On Oct. 23, 2005, Killa Cam was shot in Washington, D.C., after he resisted a robber trying to jack him for his royal blue 2006 Lamborghini. Despite being shot in both of his arms, Cam flashed his lights and managed to drive long enough to pull over and get a fan to drive him to the Howard University Hospital. At the time, he didn't seem to be all that fazed by a chain of events that would've been pretty traumatizing for most people. "I got shot three times and my album comes out Nov. 22," Cam said as he left the hospital. "We love Howard."</p>

      <h3>Fabolous</h3>
      <p>Funeral Fab was standing in a parking garage when he was shot in the leg on the morning of Oct. 17, 2006. In an interview with MTV, Fab said the shooting caused him to re-examine some of the elements of his life. "I just fell back, took it easy," he said. "Maybe I was doing a little too much. Let some things take their course. I had never been shot before. I had to chill for a minute and got focused on the music and other things rather than being out and running around."</p>

      <h3>Gillie Da Kid</h3>
      <p>Gillie Da Kid was already a fairly established name in the rap game in 2006, but as is the case with countless other instances of violence, that did nothing to protect him from the heat of a few hot bullets- -- not even in his hometown. The "I'm Da Man" performer was posted up in his native Philadelphia when he was shot twice in the arm and once in his leg as he was getting into his car on June 14, 2006. Gillie was rushed to the hospital after his shooting, and thankfully managed to survive the encounter.</p>

Though details are still coming in about the incident, the injuries didn't seem to be too serious granted the fact that Keak appeared for a show the next night. Hobbling onstage with crutches, Keak posted a snippet of the performance on his Instagram, captioning the clip, "You‚Äôll never understand how valuable life is until it flash before ya eyes üôèüèæ Gods plan can never be determined by man an fa that I‚Äôm still livin an Can‚Äôt nothin' on this earth stop me!‚Äù</p>

      <h3>Trae Tha Truth</h3>
      <p>Trae Tha Truth was exiting a Houston strip club when he was shot in his shoulder on June 20, 2012. In a shooting that left three dead, the Grand Hustle Records MC was lucky to escape with his life. Speaking with <i>XXL</i> around the time of the shooting some four-and-a-half years ago, Trae explained that the shooting seemed random. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure exactly what the altercation was necessarily about, but long story short, whatever transpired, they ran in my direction, so in the process of running in my direction, that kind of had everybody in the open,‚Äù Trae said. ‚ÄúSo as the altercation came my way, shots were being dispersed, but since it was coming our direction, it was a crowd of people. Everybody was wrong place, wrong time.‚Äù</p>

      <h3>Troy Ave</h3>
      <p>2016 wasn't too kind to Troy Ave, who was shot three times during the calendar year. The first incident took place on May 26, 2016 during a T.I. concert at Irving Plaza in New York. During the shootout, which video evidence proves the <i>White Christmas 4 </i>creator also participated in, Troy sustained a gunshot wound to his leg. Seven months later Troy was shot twice on Christmas Day. Troy was sitting in his Maserati in New York when an attacker approached his car and began firing shots. One bullet struck Troy Ave's arm, while another grazed his head. Luckily, the "Your Style" rapper made it to see another day.</p>

He was taken to the hospital and went into surgery immediately, when his manager reported that the battle rapper was "not in good shape."

He has also reportedly moved out of New Jersey.</p>

      <h3>Uncle Murda</h3>
      <p>On Jan. 23, 2008, Uncle Murda was shot in his head as he sat in a parked car in New York. According to him, he was minding his own business when he saw one of his enemies approach the whip, and after the two got into an argument, shots were fired. At first, the Brooklyn MC didn't realize he'd been hit, believing the blood on his face to be the result of the shattered glass that had scattered the vehicle he was sitting in. His friend checked him out, and upon further inspection, discovered that a slug hit the rapper in his head.</p>

The unidentified man asked Waka for his jewelry, and as the exchange was being made, fired shots into the rhymer's arm and shoulder. Despite the wounds, Waka remained in good spirits as he had the support of his friends and family and received calls from the then-incarcerated Gucci Mane while he recovered from the gun shot.</p>
