      <p>The chase for Wigan Athletic striker Joe Gelhardt is hotting up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-join-man-utd-liverpool-20897626">According to The Daily Star</a>, Gelhardt is now a target for Chelsea. Frank Lampard has joined Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and others in pursuit of the teenage striker.</p>
      <p>Manchester City, Manchester United and Everton have also been monitoring Gelhardt. The 17-year-old recently signed a new contract with Wigan but the Latics already face a battle to keep him.</p>
      <p>Despite his young age, Gelhardt is already in and around the first-team. He has played seven senior matches, all off the bench, and he scored his maiden professional goal this season.</p>

      <p>Gelhardt found the net with an equaliser against Hull City in the Championship. He also scored against Liverpool in a recent youth team game so his talent is not going unnoticed.</p>
      <p>It looks like the England U18 striker might get a big move in the near future unless Wigan can keep him. Wigan value Gelhardt at £5m, plus add-ons.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Liverpool have a clear advantage in this race as Gelhardt is a boyhood fan. He was born in Liverpool and supported the Reds. But Chelsea have a good relationship with Wigan so that could work in their favour.</p>
      <p>After signing a new contract, Gelhardt needs to decide where he will develop. At Wigan, he is getting game time so it might be wise to stay put for a while.</p>
