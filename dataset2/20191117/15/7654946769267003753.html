      <h1>Chemistry professors accused of running ‘Breaking Bad’-style meth lab</h1>

      <p>Two Arkansas chemistry professors have been arrested for allegedly making meth in a case being likened to TV hit Breaking Bad.</p>
      <p>Terry David Bateman, 45, and Bradley Allen Rowland, 40, were arrested Friday afternoon and face charges of manufacturing methamphetamine and using drug paraphernalia, <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/two-henderson-chemistry-professors-arrested-for-making-meth">according to KATV</a>.</p>
      <p>It closely resembles the plot of the TV hit show whose central character, Walter White, was a teacher who turned to drug production.</p>
      <p>Officials did not say where the professors at <a href="https://www.hsu.edu/">Henderson State University</a> in Arkadelphia are alleged to have produced the drugs. However, the investigation coincided with a science lab at the uni being forced to close early last month over reports of an “undetermined chemical odor,” officials told the TV station.</p>
      <p>Tests found benzyl chloride, a chemical closely monitored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration which can be used to synthesize amphetamines, the station said.</p>
      <p>The lab was closed for three weeks while the university’s environmental service company used scrubber systems to filter air and temporarily removed windows to help with ventilation, officials told the station.</p>
      <p>It finally opened on Oct. 29 after third-party testing showed the building met Environmental Protection Agency standards.</p>
      <p>The two professors were put on administrative leave on Oct. 1. They were arrested Friday afternoon by Clark County Sheriff’s Department, the force confirmed to the station.</p>
      <p>Both are expected to appear in Clark County District Court once a formal charging decision is made by the prosecutor, the sheriff’s department said, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/us/arkansas-professors-arrested-meth/index.html">according to CNN</a>.</p>
