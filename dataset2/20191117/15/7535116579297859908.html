      <p>One man gave new meaning to the word hitchhiking as he latched himself to a moving trailer to get to his destination.</p>
      <p>The unidentified man, dressed only in jeans was seen hanging on to the back end of a trailer nearby Jalan Kempas Lama, Johor.</p>
      <p>The video of the man was however unclear in the beginning but as the video went on the man stepped down from the trailer and ran away from the trailer as it approaches a junction.</p>
      <p>Here is the video of the man braving heavy traffic whilst hitching on his grab ride.</p>
      <p>We, advice viewers, to not try this at home and not take the word Grab so literally.</p>

      <p>Though the clip may look funny, it is important to highlight the dangers normally associated with hanging on to a moving vehicle.</p>
      <p>This is not Hollywood after all.</p>
