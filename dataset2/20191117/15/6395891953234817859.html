      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Calling hours are being held for a Massachusetts fire lieutenant who died looking for a baby possibly trapped inside a burning home.</p>
      <p>Officials say Lt. Jason Menard died Wednesday after he and his crew went into a Worcester home to look for a baby reportedly trapped on the third floor. He helped two of his colleagues escape but was unable to get out himself.</p>
      <p>Calling hours are being held from 3 to 7 p.m. Sunday at Mercadante Funeral Home. Funeral services will be held Monday at St. John's Catholic Church, followed by a private family procession. Thousands of mourners are expected to attend the service.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old leaves behind a wife and three children. A fund for Menard's children has been set up at the Worcester Fire Department Credit Union.</p>
