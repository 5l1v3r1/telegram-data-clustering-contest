      <p>Getting a good night's rest can be difficult when your duvet causes you to overheat. To help you in your search for the <a href="https://www.tuck.com/best-duvet-inserts/">best lightweight duvet inserts</a>, I've gathered a list of the top options on Amazon, based on three main consideration: fill, shell material, and stitching.</p>
      <p>Whether you're looking for a duvet insert, choosing the right fill will be an important factor in your decision. There are three common fill types: goose down, alternative down, and silk fill. Down alternative made from materials like microfiber and polyester tend to be much more affordable, less likely to aggravate allergies, and more suitable for all seasons. While goose down can provide more warmth and loft, you'll want to stick to a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-goose-down-comforters-15523282">fill power of 600</a> or less to keep the duvet lightweight. The higher the fill, the heavier and warmer it will be. For hot sleepers, a silk-filled option can regulate body temperature and is super lightweight. However, silk bedding often has a much a higher price point than other options.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the duvet's shell, your options include polyester, microfiber, cotton, or a blend of materials. <a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/run/how-to-pick-the-most-breathable-fabrics">Polyester tends to be moisture-wicking</a> and often budget-friendly, but it may not be as soft or breathable as cotton. Microfiber, which is typically <a href="https://www.thesnoozzz.com/microfiber-vs-polyester/#T3">made from polyester or a blend of polyester and nylon</a>, on the other hand, is <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-wrinkle-free-sheets-11502070">breathable, durable, and wrinkle-resistant</a>.</p>
      <p>Depending on the type of fill, duvet inserts will usually have either <a href="https://www.mattressclarity.com/blog/baffle-box-vs-sewn-through-comforters/">sewn-through or baffle-box stitching</a>. The former is a more affordable option, but the latter is better for real goose down options in particular, as it allows more room for the down to achieve its full loft. Both will help keep the fill evenly distributed.</p>
      <p>Read on for the best lightweight duvet inserts to keep you cool and comfortable all night (and they work especially well when paired with a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-cooling-duvet-covers-18210139">cooling duvet cover</a>).</p>

It is better than what I expected at that low of a price. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not amazingly luxurious. But it’s a great quality for the price."</p>
