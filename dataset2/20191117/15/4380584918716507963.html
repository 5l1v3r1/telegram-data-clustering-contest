        <i>MLB.com is keeping track of all the latest rumors involving the Mets right here.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how the Mets could replace Wheeler</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 17:</i> After Zack Wheeler rejected the Mets' one-year qualifying offer this week, the team presumably has at least $17.8 million -- the cost of the QO this year -- to put toward the pitching staff. However, that money isn't guaranteed to go entirely to one pitcher, writes <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/betances-hamels-how-mets-can-spend-their-zack-wheeler-money/">Mike Puma of the New York Post</a>.</p>
      <p>The Mets already have four-fifths of their rotation under control for 2020, with two-time reigning National League Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom joined by Noah Syndergaard, Marcus Stroman and Steven Matz.</p>
      <p>New York general manager Brodie Van Wagenen has said that Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman could compete to join the starting staff next season after spending 2019 in the bullpen. If the Mets go with Lugo or Gsellman as their No. 5 starter, they could use their resources to sign a pair of relievers. Puma names Will Harris, Daniel Hudson, Drew Pomeranz, Dellin Betances and Craig Stammen as potential targets.</p>
      <p>The club also could leave Lugo and Gsellman in the 'pen and sign a veteran to fill the fifth rotation spot. Puma thinks Cole Hamels, Michael Pineda, Rick Porcello, Wade Miley or Iván Nova could fit into the team's budget and still leave room for one of the relievers mentioned above.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Could Mets be bold and target Betts or Lindor?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 15:</i> Much of the focus early in the offseason tends to be on the numerous free agents, simply because scores of players suddenly flood the market and can be acquired by signing them for money. The trade front, though, tends to be a little slower to develop, but already there are two <i>really</i> big names being bandied about as possible chips ...</p>
      <p>Red Sox outfielder and 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts and star Indians shortstop Francisco Lindor.</p>
      <p>Given that both players are very much in their primes and under club control only for a short time -- the 27-year-old Betts through 2020 and the 26-year-old Lindor through '21 -- it would seem that teams going all in on next season should be most interested in going after either one.</p>
      <p>Enter ... (drum roll, please!) ... the Mets. That might seem like a surprise given that the team didn't make the postseason in '19 and resides in a highly competitive NL East that is home to the World Series-champion Nationals and the Braves, with their incredibly young and talented core coming off two straight division titles.</p>
      <p>But there are more than a few reasons why the Mets would make quite a bit of sense as suitors for either Betts or Lindor, as MLB.com's David Adler wrote. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mets-should-trade-for-mookie-betts-or-francisco-lindor">More &gt;</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Van Wagenen: Syndergaard no longer for sale</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 14:</i> Noah Syndergaard's name has been tied to trade rumors off and on for the better part of the past year, if not longer. As a frontline-caliber starting pitcher with elite velocity, nasty stuff and two more years of club control -- all at the age of 27 -- it's easy to see why other teams have continued to check in with New York about his availability.</p>
      <p>Well, Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen has rebuffed Syndergaard suitors to this point, and he's making it pretty clear that the right-hander is more or less off limits, indicating that Syndergaard is no longer for sale, according to MLB.com's Anthony DiComo.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/AnthonyDiComo/status/1195040029590118400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Of course, that does imply that Syndergaard -- who finally stayed fully healthy and threw a career-high 197 2/3 innings despite struggling over the first half of 2019 (4.68 ERA, 1.27 WHIP) -- actually might have been gettable at one point.</p>
      <p>But with the Mets coming off an 86-win campaign and deploying two-time reigning NL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom and NL Rookie of the Year Award winner Pete Alonso, they're clearly going for it in 2020. That means an in-his-prime Syndergaard is once again expected to be a key contributor, if not a driving force, for the Mets -- and that he's no longer a trade chip.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mets could consider these players for center field</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 13:</i> According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/what-mets-could-be-looking-at-for-center-field-upgrade/">Mike Puma of the New York Post</a>, the Mets are working with two criteria in their search for a new center fielder. First, the player must provide a notable defensive upgrade over Brandon Nimmo. Secondly, the team would prefer a right-handed hitter to balance out the left-handed bats of Michael Conforto, Nimmo and Dominic Smith.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, Puma names the Pirates' Starling Marte, the Giants' Kevin Pillar and the Padres' Manuel Margot as potential options.</p>
      <p>The Red Sox's Jackie Bradley Jr. could also be available, but he bats from the left side. The same goes for Shogo Akiyama, who is a free agent after nine seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball.</p>
      <p>Marte, 31, recorded 23 homers, an .845 OPS and 3.0 FanGraphs' Wins Above Replacement in 2019. He's under control for $11.5 million in 2020 after Pittsburgh picked up his team option, and he has another option for $12.5 million in '21.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Pillar (21 homers, .719 OPS, 1.5 fWAR in 2019) is a non-tender candidate after earning $5.8 million this season, while the 25-year-old Margot (12 HR, .691 OPS, 1.6 fWAR in '19) is arbitration-eligible for the first time.</p>
      <p>Margot was one of the leading outfielders in Statcast's <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/outs_above_average">Outs Above Average</a> metric, posting +11 OAA in 2019. Bradley had +6 OAA, while Marte and Pillar each had +2. Nimmo finished with +3 OAA.</p>
      <p>Van Wagenen said he's confident Nimmo can handle center field if the Mets don't pick up an alternative.</p>
      <p>“Even if we were to acquire a piece for the outfield, we went into last year and we believed Nimmo could be an everyday center fielder,” Van Wagenen said. “It was unfortunate that he dealt with the injuries that he did, but we believe that he can play every day in center field and he’s a valuable piece to our club. We saw the athleticism from Brandon at the end of the year when he came back in September and if we went into the season today, he is our center fielder.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sherman: Porcello, Pineda, Wood could bolster Mets' rotation</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> The Mets are already brushing up near the first <a href="http://m.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/competitive-balance-tax">competitive balance tax</a> (CBT) threshold of $208 million as they enter this offseason, and that could inspire them to get "creative" with their roster construction, notes MLB Network insider Joel Sherman.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/rick-porcello-is-one-answer-to-unique-opportunity-for-mets/">Writing for the New York Post</a>, Sherman pegs Mets right-hander Seth Lugo as the club's big pitching question in regards to whether he returns to the bullpen or tries his hand at starting once again. If Lugo relieves again, Sherman identifies free agents like Rick Porcello, Michael Pineda and Alex Wood as potentially affordable rotation bolsters to support Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Marcus Stroman and Steven Matz.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mets eyeing Betances as relief option</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov 11:</i> The Mets saw plenty of Dellin Betances in his years starring in the Yankees' bullpen across town. Now they're eyeing the free-agent reliever for themselves, according to a report from SNY's Andy Martino on Monday.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/martinonyc/status/1194059236457664513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Betances pitched in only one game in 2019, missing almost the whole year with right shoulder and lat injuries before suffering a freak Achilles tear jumping off the mound to celebrate a strikeout in his season debut. But he's expected to be fully recovered in plenty of time before the 2020 season, and when he's healthy, Betances can be one of the most dominant relievers in baseball.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old right-hander recorded five straight 100-strikeout seasons from 2014-18 and was an All-Star four times in that span. The Mets' bullpen, meanwhile, is one of their biggest areas of need this offseason.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dreaming up Betts-to-Mets trade scenarios</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 11:</i> How does a team acquire a superstar like Betts? How do the Red Sox acquire anything close to equal talent for him?</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/mlb-execs-on-3-potential-ways-mets-could-trade-for-mookie-betts/311760976">SNY's Matthew Cerrone</a></b> attempts to work out the details with hypothetical trade scenarios that put Betts on the Mets, citing conversations he had with MLB insiders last month. His three scenarios include: a) The Mets trading Major Leaguers, like either Brandon Nimmo and Steven Matz as a package or ace Noah Syndergaard; b) Trading Jeff McNeil for Betts and a Red Sox starter, such as Nathan Eovaldi; or c) Dealing closer Edwin Díaz and Dominic Smith in exchange for Betts.</p>
      <p>Cerrone also notes that the Red Sox could look elsewhere for a trade, identifying the Braves, Cubs, Cardinals, Nationals and Padres as potential partners.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What will Mets do if Wheeler departs?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 11:</i> Zack Wheeler will decline the Mets' one-year, $17.8 million qualifying offer, according to a report Monday from MLB Network insider Jon Heyman -- but that doesn't mean Wheeler's leaving New York.</p>
      <p>The Mets are interested in a multiyear deal to keep Wheeler, per Heyman. If they can't come to an agreement, they'll pursue other options to round out the rotation.</p>
      <p>With Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Marcus Stroman and Steven Matz under control for 2020, the Mets could seek a less expensive replacement starter via trade or free agency. It's even possible that New York's future No. 5 starter is already on the roster.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/1194063696634363905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>General manager Brodie Van Wagenen said last week that Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman <a href="https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/mets-to-consider-seth-lugo-robert-gsellman-as-starting-rotation-options-in-2020/311393000">will be considered for starting roles</a>. The problem is that Lugo and Gsellman have been two of the team's most reliable relievers over the past two years. Lugo was especially valuable in 2019, throwing 80 stellar innings (150 ERA+) out of the bullpen and taking over as the team's closer down the stretch in place of the struggling Edwin Díaz.</p>
      <p>If the Mets move Lugo or Gsellman to the rotation, it would create a void in the bullpen that would need to be addressed. That's where the free-agent market comes in, and veteran reliever Daniel Hudson, who closed out Game 7 of the World Series for the Nationals, could be a target.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sny.tv/mets/news/daniel-hudson-anyone-mets-path-to-playoffs-could-be-free-agent-reliever-market/311755826">SNY's Andy Martino</a>, members of the Mets' front office met with the agency that represents both Wheeler and Hudson on Monday. Sources told Martino that the Mets were interested in Hudson last offseason but were ultimately scared off by health concerns.</p>
      <p>After being released by the Angels in March, Hudson went on to post a 186 ERA+ over 73 innings between the Blue Jays and Nats. The 32-year-old also appeared in nine postseason games, recording a 3.72 ERA with four saves in four chances.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Could this former Mets pitcher be team's pitching coach?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 10:</i> The Mets are interviewing former pitcher Jeremy Hefner for the team's pitching coach vacancy, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcCarig/status/1193376932597051392">report from The Athletic</a>. Hefner appeared in 50 Major League games in his career, all with the Mets in 2012 and 2013. Hefner retired following the 2016 season, when he pitched for the Cardinals in the Minors. In 2017, he began working as an advance scout for the Twins, and in 2019 he became the team's assistant pitching coach.</p>
      <p>Hefner is well-versed in analytics, according to the report, and excels at conveying that to current pitchers, as a recently retired player himself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Another Mookie in Queens? This would be big</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 7:</i> The Mets might have as big a center-field hole as any team in baseball, and MLB Network insider Joel Sherman writes that Mookie Betts is exactly the player to fill that need.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/mets-center-field-fixes-mookie-betts-pipedream-to-a-cheaper-red-sox-trade/">Writing for the New York Post</a> on Thursday, Sherman outlined the Mets’ 2018 woes in center; Michael Conforto and Brandon Nimmo brought offense but were well below-average defensively, while glove stud Juan Lagares didn’t hit enough to justify an everyday spot in the lineup. New manager Carlos Beltrán has plenty of lineup-card options at the corner outfield spots in 2020, but center field remains a mystery in Queens.</p>
      <p>Sherman lists Betts as the “pipe dream” option as an elite bat who could slide over from right field and contribute excellent defense in center, and he poses a hypothetical Betts-for-Noah Syndergaard trade that far surpasses the “splash” terminology. <a href="https://www.rosterresource.com/mlb-new-york-mets-info/">Syndergaard’s salary</a> is roughly <a href="https://www.rosterresource.com/mlb-boston-red-sox-info/">one-third of Betts’</a> next season, and he’s under club control through ’21 as well. Sherman posits that Boston could spin Syndergaard forward in a subsequent trade to acquire younger talent and cut even more payroll.</p>
      <p>It’s a showy move that would seem to fit Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen’s early approach. But is it realistic? We’ll have to stay tuned.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Wheeler sign long-term deal with Mets?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 4:</i> In a widely expected move, the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/zack-wheeler-gets-qualifying-offer-from-mets">Mets extended a one-year, $17.8 million qualifying offer</a> to Wheeler before Monday's deadline. That sets up New York to receive Draft-pick compensation upon Wheeler joining another team, assuming the right-hander rejects the offer. Wheeler has 10 days to make his decision.</p>
      <p>General manager Brodie Van Wagenen indicated that the team has had discussions with Wheeler on a long-term contract and will continue that dialogue if the 29-year-old declines the offer. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/zack-wheeler-rumors">More &gt;</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Mets hire Beltrán as manager</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 1:</i> The Mets announced Friday that they have signed Beltrán to a three-year managerial contract with a fourth-year club option, making the Puerto Rico native the first Latino manager in Mets history.</p>
      <p>“We are thrilled, as we know our passionate fans will be, to have him back in the family,” Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon said in a statement. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/carlos-beltran-to-be-new-mets-manager">More &gt;</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Rendon, Cole in blue and orange?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Oct. 29:</i> If you heard New York mentioned in connection with Anthony Rendon or Gerrit Cole, your first thought might be "Yankees." But why not the Mets?</p>
      <p>MLB Network insider Joel Sherman argues in an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/28/mets-can-stop-the-laughter-with-monster-gerrit-cole-or-anthony-rendon-splash/">article for the New York Post</a> that the Mets should be thinking big in free agency. Rendon and Cole are as big as it gets.</p>
      <p>General manager Brodie Van Wagenen "wants the Mets to reach large-market behemoth status," Sherman writes. To do that, "the Mets should be in the forefront for the two best free agents" -- Cole and Rendon, who'd be perfect fits for the Mets.</p>
      <p>"Cole and Rendon are great," Sherman writes. "The Mets have a need for both."</p>
      <p>Third base might be the biggest position question mark on the Mets' roster. Rendon is a superstar there. Meanwhile, pair Gerrit Cole with Jacob deGrom in the rotation and the Mets have arguably the best starting pitching duo in the game.</p>
      <p>They'd even have the flexibility to, for example, trade Noah Syndergaard if they got Cole, or a surplus position player -- maybe one of the trio of Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo and Michael Conforto -- if they got Rendon. That would allow them to address even more needs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Does Wheeler deserve similar deal to Corbin's?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Oct. 23:</i> Zack Wheeler is set to enter free agency this offseason, and there's a case to be made that his performance merits a deal in the range of Patrick Corbin's contract with the Nationals (six years, $140 million).</p>
      <p>In breaking down Wheeler's value, <a href="https://theathletic.com/1306612/2019/10/22/what-is-zack-wheeler-worth-and-should-the-mets-pay-that-price/">Tim Britton of The Athletic</a> (subscription required) points out that the right-hander's FanGraphs Wins Above Replacement total over the past two seasons was 8.9. In the two years prior to hitting the open market in 2018, Corbin had an identical fWAR figure.</p>
      <p>Wheeler also compares favorably to some other pitchers who landed similar contracts in free agency. Before he signed a six-year, $155 million contract with the Cubs in 2015, Jon Lester had 8.7 fWAR over '14-15. Johnny Cueto joined the Giants on a six-year, $130 million contract shortly after Lester inked his pact with Chicago. In '14-15, Cueto's fWAR was 8.5.</p>
      <p>What could hurt Wheeler's stock, in Britton's view, is the 29-year-old's injury history. Wheeler made 60 starts over the past two seasons, but before that he missed all of 2015-16 and started only 17 games in '17.</p>
      <p>Corbin also had the benefit of being the top pitcher on the market in a thin year for free-agent starters. This offseason, Wheeler's counterparts will include Gerrit Cole, Madison Bumgarner, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Jake Odorizzi and possibly Stephen Strasburg.</p>
      <p>Britton considers it more likely Wheeler will get a three- or four-year deal, with a salary in the range of $54 million to $64 million, than one for five years.</p>
      <p>With Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Marcus Stroman and Steven Matz under control for 2020, the Mets could move on from Wheeler, though they will likely make him a one-year, $17.8 million qualifying offer to put themselves in position to receive Draft-pick compensation if he departs.</p>
