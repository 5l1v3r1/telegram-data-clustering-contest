      <p>A 49-year-old is facing charges after allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/staten-island-man-stabs-wife-sets-home-on-fire-in-domestic-fight/">attacking his wife and set fire to their Staten Island home</a>, cops said Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rogelio Mendez-Rodriguez is accused of choking and stabbing his wife in the wild domestic dispute that left their St. George home gutted from the fire Saturday night, according to police.</p>
      <p>Mendez-Rodriguez was charged with strangulation, assault, arson, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal obstruction of breathing, cops said.</p>
      <p>The wife had run across the street to a neighbor’s house on Monroe Avenue frantic, saying, “Her husband had stabbed her,” and the husband “was setting the place on fire,” the neighbor, Annie O’Hara, told The Post.</p>
      <p>The wife, whose name was not released, was still hospitalized at Richmond University Medical Center Sunday morning, but in stable condition, officials said.</p>
