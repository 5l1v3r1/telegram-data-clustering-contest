      <p>George Weston Ltd. will release its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The Toronto-based retail, bakery and real estate company reported in July that second-quarter profit jumped to $184 million, up from $28 million last year, as it benefited from acquiring direct ownership of a controlling stake in Choice Properties from its subsidiary.</p>

      <p>TC Energy Corp. hosts its annual Investor Day to provide an update on operations, recent developments and strategic outlook on Tuesday.

        <b>October inflation numbers</b>
      </p>
      <p>Statistics Canada to release its consumer price index for October on Wednesday. The agency's report for September stated that the annual inflation rate was 1.9 per cent for a second-straight month, keeping the indicator close to the Bank of Canada's ideal two per cent target.</p>

        <b>Metro update</b>
      </p>
