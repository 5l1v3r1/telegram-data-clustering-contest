      <p><b>In this week’s top stories: </b>Apple officially unveils the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Disney+ debuts, Apple Watch Black Friday pricing, and more. Read on for all of this week’s biggest news.</p>
      <p>After months of rumors, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is now official. Starting at $2,399, the new MacBook Pro includes a return to the scissor switch keyboard design with what Apple is calling a “Magic Keyboard.” You also get a physical Esc key as well as a standalone Touch ID button. The overall form factor is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/14/15-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro-comparison/">slightly larger than the 15-inch MacBook Pro</a>, which actually <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-discontinues-15-inch-macbook-pro-as-16-inch-now-available/">no longer sold by Apple</a>. You can read more about the 16-inch MacBook Pro in <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">our full coverage right here.</a></p>
      <p>Apple also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-mac-pro-availability/">announced this week that the new Mac Pro</a> will be available next month. The Mac Pro will start at $5,999 with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, 32GB of RAM, and just 256GB of SSD storage. The Pro Display XDR starts at $4,999 with the stand going for $999. Build to order configuration details about the Mac Pro aren’t yet available, but we should learn more about that in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>In other news, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/disney-app-now-available-to-download-on-iphone-ipad-and-apple-tv/">Disney+ officially debuted this week</a>.
