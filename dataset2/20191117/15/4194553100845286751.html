      <h1>Virgil van Dijk has withdrawn from Netherlands squad for “personal circumstances”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:59:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has withdrawn from the Netherlands squad for “personal circumstances”, ahead of the Oranje’s final UEFA Euro qualifying fixture against Estonia.</p>
      <blockquote>Virgil van Dijk has left the Netherlands' camp "due to personal circumstances" according to Dutch FA.<br/>Won't be playing against Estonia on Tuesday.<br/>— Paul Gorst (@ptgorst) <a href="https://twitter.com/ptgorst/status/1196057951557095424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>The big centre half doesn’t have to worry about his team making the competition as the draw they earned against Northern Ireland secured their spot at the Euros next year.</p>
      <p>He becomes the latest player to pull out of this month’s internationals, with Joe Gomez, Andy Robertson, Jordan Henderson, Mohamed Salah and Caoimhin Kelleher all absent due to illness and injury.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if whatever has caused Virgil to withdraw from his international squad will have an impact on his availability for the Reds against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Hopefully it’s nothing too serious for the No.4. It wouldn’t be <i>that </i>wild to suggest that he’d rather get back to Merseyside to prepare for the Reds.</p>
      <p>To be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s why many of our players have brought themselves back early from international duty.</p>
      <p>All that being said, I do hope nothing too serious has happened to any of the players that have pulled out – with the players’ well-being being the most important thing.</p>
