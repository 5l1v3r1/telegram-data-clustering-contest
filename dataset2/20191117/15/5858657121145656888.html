      <p>LOS ANGELES — A month after two men were arrested at an illicit marijuana farm on public land in the California wilderness, authorities are assessing the environmental impact and cleanup costs at the site.</p>
      <p>A group including Forest Service rangers, scientists and conservationists hiked into the so-called trespass grow where 9,000 cannabis plants were illegally cultivated in the Shasta Trinity National Forest.</p>
      <p>Officials say trees were clear-cut, waterways diverted, and the ground littered with containers of fertilizer and rodenticide.</p>
      <p>The cleanup efforts are spearheaded by the group Cannabis Removal on Public Lands Project — or CROP. It’s a coalition of conservation organizations, tribes, elected officials, police and federal land managers. Also lending its support is the legal cannabis industry, which says it’s being undercut by the criminal market.</p>
      <p>CROP is lobbying for funding to reclaim an estimated 2,000 sites, a process it says could take seven to 10 years.</p>
