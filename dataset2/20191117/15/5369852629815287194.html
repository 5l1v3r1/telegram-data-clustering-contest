      <p>NEMO RANGERS REMAIN on course for a 17th AIB Munster Club SFC title after they accounted for Austin Stacks at Páirc Uí Rinn on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Cork champions were far sharper throughout, having overcome Newcastle West last Sunday while Stacks, representing Kerry after winning the club championship, were playing their first championship game since a defeat to East Kerry in September.</p>
      <p>Things might have been different had Fiachna Mangan made more of a first-minute goal opportunity for Stacks, but Micheál Martin in the Nemo goal saved well at the expense of a 45, which came to nothing.</p>
      <p>Slowly, Nemo got going, Mark Cronin with the opening point after he had intercepted a Stacks kickout and further scores followed from Paul Kerrigan, Kevin O’Donovan and Jack Horgan before Shane O’Callaghan opened the Stacks account in the 17th minute.</p>

      <p>Nemo were well in control, though, with midfielder James McDermott excellent as they pressed the Stacks kickout, and the loss of full-back Barry Shanahan to injured further hampered the Kerry side.</p>
      <p>The Nemo tally continued to build and Luke Connolly made it 0-9 to 0-1 as injury time dawned with a super effort from a tight angle on the right, set up by full-back Aidan O’Reilly. While Seán Quilter did pull one back for Stacks with a free after that, Nemo retired with a ten-point half-time lead, Kerrigan’s knifing run allowing him to set up Kevin O’Donovan for a well-taken goal in injury time.</p>
      <p>Two Kerrigan points on the resumption ensured that there were no fears of a fightback while only a good Darragh O’Brien save from Connolly denied Nemo a second goal. Kerrigan, meanwhile, opted to fire over when a Connolly pass put him in.</p>
      <p>A second goal did come just before the three-quarter mark from Alan O’Donovan, captain Barry O’Driscoll the creator, and Nemo had 18 points to spare by the end.</p>
