      <h1>ESPN Sideline Reporter Posts Heartfelt Message For QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:04:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s Molly McGrath was the sideline reporter for Saturday afternoon’s Alabama-Mississippi State game. This meant she had to deal with the devastating injury to quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, reporting on it throughout the game.</p>
      <p>McGrath is a pro and she handled it well, of course, but she’s also human. The ESPN reporter has covered Tagovailoa before and clearly did not enjoy having to report on his heartbreaking injury.</p>
      <p>The veteran ESPN reporter took to Instagram following the game to post a heartfelt message.</p>
      <p>“College football is a beautiful, wild, unpredictable game,” she wrote. “I first fell in love with covering sports because I am fascinated by human psychology. I love learning about what makes people Great, and am amazed by the young athletes who grow up and compete on a national stage. Their life’s biggest accomplishments and biggest failures are broadcast to the country and they deal with an unimaginable amount of pressure. Not all of them handle it with grace, but Tua Tagovailoa always has. Guys like him are why I love what I do. My heart hurts for him as he embarks upon this chapter of adversity…but I have no doubt that he will continue to be Great.”</p>

      <p>Well said, Molly.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, meanwhile, is out for the season, but he appears to be in good spirits.</p>
      <p>“Thank you all for the prayers and well wishes! God always has a plan,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Tuaamann">he wrote</a>.</p>
