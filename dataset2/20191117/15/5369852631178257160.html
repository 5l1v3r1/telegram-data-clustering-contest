      <p>JAMES DOYLE WAS the St Mullin’s hero as he scored two magnificent points in injury time to put the Carlow champions through to the Leinster hurling final for the first time in their history.</p>
      <p>They become just the second-ever team from the county after Mount Leinster to reach the provincial showpiece and they will face Ballyhale Shamrocks in the final in two weeks’ time.</p>

      <p>This was a game that swung one way and then the other for the course of the 60 minutes and Laois champions Rathdowney-Errill, who were also seeking to reach the final for the first time, thought they had done enough when sub Shane Madden gave them the lead as two minutes of injury time were signalled.</p>
      <p>However, St Mullin’s had other ideas and Doyle scored two wonderful individual points to see them through.</p>
      <p>It looked for a long time like it would be a battle of the two Kavanaghs as Rathdowney-Errill’s Mark and St Mullin’s Marty engaged in a point swapping fest for much of the game.</p>
      <p>Mark ended the game with twelve points while Marty scored 1-9 and his goal, which came in the first half, was followed by another from Paddy Boland.</p>
      <p>Paddy Purcell got Rathdowney-Errill’s only goal in the opening period, too, and that helped them to a 1-10 to 2-6 lead at the interval.</p>

      <p>St Mullin’s began the second half with four points in three minutes and they held onto that lead right to the end of normal time where they fell behind before Doyle worked his magic.</p>
      <p>Rathdowney-Errill did have a late chance to force extra time but Joe McDonagh Player of the Year Paddy Purcell blazed a shot wide with the final puck of the game.</p>
