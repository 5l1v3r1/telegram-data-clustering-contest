        <b>PSNI detectives have launched an attempted murder investigation after a group of men entered a house in Co Fermanagh armed with machetes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police were alerted at around 9.15pm last night that a number of men had entered the home at Trasna Way in Lisnaskea.</p>
      <p>They forced their way in and attacked two of the occupants, a 41-year-old woman and a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>The young girl sustained serious stab wounds and is in a critical but stable condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>The older woman was stabbed in the leg but has since been released from hospital.</p>
      <p>A baby who was also in the house was not harmed in the incident.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: "This must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved and we are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>"We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on.‚Äù</p>
