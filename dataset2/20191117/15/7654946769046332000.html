      <h1>This NFL bet has become a complete waste of money</h1>

      <p>Since its inception, VSiN has been warning you not to load up on NFL favorites in money-line parlays.</p>
      <p>This squarest of square strategies will drain your bankroll over the long haul and runs the risk of ruin on any given Sunday.</p>
      <p>For newcomers, a money-line parlay is a proposition bet in which your choices only have to win their games straight up. No point spreads. The catch … all of your choices in each parlay must win to cash the ticket.</p>
      <p>If you bet a two-team parlay featuring teams that ultimately go 1-1, you lose the bet. If you bet a four-teamer, and three of four win their games, you still lose your bet. Parlays must sweep.</p>
      <p>Sportsbooks nationally are coming off one of their biggest Sundays in history because all of these failed favorites caused parlays to face-plant:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>New Orleans (-14) lost to Atlanta, 26-9.</b> The Falcons were supposedly tanking for draft position. New Orleans was coming off a bye and had Drew Brees back at the helm. The Saints missed market expectations by 31 points and killed uncountable parlays.</li>
        <li><b>Indianapolis (-11) lost to Miami, 16-12.</b> Few wanted to lay the points with Indy given its quarterback situation. But, asking the Colts to win at home straight up against another possible tanker, one in a letdown spot no less, proved irresistible to many.</li>
        <li><b>San Francisco (-6) lost to Seattle, 27-24, in overtime.</b> We’re going in order of spread size. Most money-line parlays were shot before this game was even played. More misery for favorite lovers, though .</li>
        <li><b>Kansas City (-5) lost at Tennessee, 35-32.</b> Patrick Mahomes was back, and the Chiefs needed to make up for lost time against supposedly overmatched Ryan Tannehill. They didn’t.</li>
        <li><b>Rams (-4) lost at Pittsburgh, 17-12.</b> The early games didn’t go well, so too many squares chased with late parlays. It’s really dumb to chase losses from a bad strategy … with the same bad strategy.</li>
        <li><b>Dallas (-3) lost to Minnesota 28-24.</b> Karma was just piling on at this point Sunday night.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that every favorite flop was a playoff contender that “needed the win.” So much for that angle.</p>
      <p>Obviously one other upset you’ll recall … the Jets (+3) stunned the Giants, 34-27. We’d bet either you or one of your buddies thought the G-Men were a sure thing.</p>
      <p>Is your portfolio still packed with too many favorites? Bet smarter.</p>
      <p>Let’s wrap it up with this week’s estimated “market” power ratings (compiled in collaboration with Jonathan Von Tobel of “The Edge”). These are based on settled late-week spreads, adjusting three points for home field.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>NFC:</b> Saints 86, 49ers 85, Packers 84, Vikings 84, Seahawks 83, Cowboys 83, Rams 82, Eagles 81, Panthers 81, Bears 79, Lions 79 (74 with Jeff Driskel), Falcons 79, Buccaneers 78, Cardinals 78, Giants 74, Redskins 72.</li>
        <li><b>AFC:</b> Patriots 88, Chiefs 85, Ravens 84, Texans 83, Chargers 82, Jaguars 80, Colts 80, Bills 80, Steelers 79, Browns 79, Raiders 79, Titans 77, Broncos 76, Jets 74, Dolphins 71, Bengals 71.</li>
      </ul>
