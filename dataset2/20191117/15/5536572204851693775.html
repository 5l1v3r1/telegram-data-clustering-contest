      <h1>Four High-Ranking Team Reps Disclose Evaluations of Kaepernick’s Workout (PIC)</h1>

      <p>Colin Kaepernick’s agent said rep from eight teams were on hand for the workout at a high school field Saturday, and their evaluations are rolling in.</p>
      <p>The free-agent quarterback made 60 scripted throws, but there were no runs or combine style drills included in the workout.</p>
      <p>“He was in good shape, as we thought he’d be. Arm strength was definitely still there and he had some real zip on the ball. But he had some accuracy issues on his deep throws. Good enough to be on a roster, likely backup level,” one talent evaluator said in their scouting report, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.</p>
      <p>“He was in good shape and he has fastball. The velocity was real good. Accuracy and touch were inconsistent. On deep balls, he was ordinary. He can still run well. Essentially average overall,” another evaluator noted.</p>
      <p>“Good showing. Thought he looked like he did when he was last on the field,” said another.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick’s 2016 season, which was his last full year, had him produce 2,241 throwing yards, 16 touchdowns, and four interceptions in 12 games. He finished that year with a 90.7 passer rating.</p>
      <p>He also ran the ball 69 times for 468 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
