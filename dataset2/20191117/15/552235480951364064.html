      <h2>Friends have launched a fundraising page to support the 20-year-old welder after the life changing incident in Aberdeen.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:26:52+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A young Aberdonian motorcyclist is recovering in hospital after losing part of his leg in a horror smash.</p>
      <p>Konrad Trojakowski, from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">city</a> , was involved in a crash on the A947 Dyce to Banff road.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old was riding a Leximoto Michigan motorcycle when he <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/motoryclist-seriously-injured-two-vehicle-20830585">collided</a> with a silver Audi A3.</p>
      <p>Emergency services treated the biker on the scene before rushing him to hospital after he suffered what was described as serious, but non-life threatening injuries at the time.</p>

      <p>The driver of the Audi was uninjured in the incident at 7.25pm on Wednesday, November 6.</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe put online by his friend Wendy Bruce has since revealed that the welder lost half of his right leg in the accident.</p>
      <p>Konrad has been inundated with well-wishing messages on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/social-media">social media</a> as he continued to recover in hospital.</p>
      <p>Fiona McLeod wrote: “You are one brave guy Konrad, thinking of you, keep strong.”</p>
      <p>Mya Owen commented: “I know we don’t talk much but you are the bravest guy I know man. Hang in there duck, I know you can get through this.”</p>
      <p>Konrad Gorczynski added: “Get well as soon as possible bro and keep strong.”</p>

      <p>The Aberdeen man has since responded to everyone on his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> account.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “I can’t even begin to express my gratitude for the people that surround me and they have given me so much hope and love for the situation I have found myself in.</p>
      <p>“I can't honestly message everybody back individually, at least not for now, because I am fading in and out of just being awake and sleeping.</p>
      <p>“I’ll take some good rest and all of you know I will message everybody back, that I promise to personally thank each and every one of you there for me.”</p>

      <p>The fundraising page for the biker has raised £975 since it was put online on Friday, November 8.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> have continued their appeal for information as they attempt to piece together the cause of the crash.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Peter Henderson of the Road Policing Department said: “Our inquiries have established that a light coloured van stopped at the scene.  We have not yet spoken to the occupant of this vehicle.</p>
      <p>"If you were the driver or a passenger in this vehicle, or know who they are, I would urge you to contact on 101 quoting incident number 3657 of November 6.</p>
      <p>"Anyone else with information who has not yet spoken to a police officer is also asked to get in touch."</p>
