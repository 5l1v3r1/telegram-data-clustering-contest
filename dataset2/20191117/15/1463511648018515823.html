      <p>The marriage solemnisation of the son of former Governor Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State, Tomiwa, and his heartthrob, Oluwakemi, has brought face-to-face his father with his successor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.</p>
      <p>The wedding took place in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Many were before the wedding on Saturday of the opinion that Fayose and Fayemi will never see face-to-face over their political differences.</p>
      <p>While Fayose is of the Peoples Democratic Party, Fayemi is of the APC and also the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum.</p>
