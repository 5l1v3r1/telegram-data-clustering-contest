      <p>Police are treating as attempted murder a machete attack on a home in Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh which left a 13-year-year-old girl in a critical condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>A number of men armed with machetes arrived at and broke into the house at Trasna Way in Lisnaskea at about 9.15 pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>PSNI Det Sgt Keith Monaghan said the gang attacked the girl and an older woman.</p>
      <p>“A 13-year-old girl sustained serious stab wounds as a result and was taken to hospital where she remains in a critical but stable condition,” he said.</p>
      <p>“A 41-year-old woman was also treated for stab wounds to her leg but has since been discharged from hospital. A baby was also present at the scene but was thankfully unharmed.”</p>

      <p>“We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on,” the officer added.</p>
      <p>A relative of the girl said she was a hero and was stabbed protecting her 11-month-old nephew.</p>
      <p>“The baby was unharmed because his auntie is a hero,” she told BBC Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“She is 13-years-old and she threw her whole self over that baby, and she saved his life. She is a hero,” she said.</p>
      <h3>‘Horrendous’</h3>
      <p>Fermanagh Sinn Féin councillor Sheamus Greene said the attack was “horrendous”. He offered his sympathy to the family and said he hoped the teenager would recover from her injuries.</p>
      <p>Local SDLP councillor Garbhan McPhillips said people were shocked by brutality of the attack.</p>
      <p>“I am angry that something like this could happen. For anybody to break into a house and stab anybody, never mind a 13-year-old girl, is horrific. I don’t what would be going through their heads that they would do something like that. It is unbelievable, to be honest,” he said.</p>
      <p>“My thoughts are with the family and please God the girl makes a full recovery. It was an awful ordeal they went through.”</p>
      <p>Alliance Fermanagh representative Matthew Beaumont said whoever carried out an attack needs to be caught quickly and to to face justice.</p>
      <p>“This attack in Lisnaskea, carried out by men carrying machetes, is to be condemned in the strongest possible terms,” he said. “This must have been a terrifying experience for [the two victims].”</p>
