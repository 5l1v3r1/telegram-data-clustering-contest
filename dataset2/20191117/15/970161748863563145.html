      <h1>As a Harry Styles fan, I'm glad he turned down the role of Prince Eric</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:02:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/mel-evans/" target="_blank">Mel Evans</a></address>
      <p>I know it might not be popular opinion, but I’m happy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> turned down the role of Prince Eric in the Little Mermaid remake.</p>
      <p>Sorry if you hate me for that, but I promise I have a point.</p>
      <p>You see, I’m a big fan of the singer – but I don’t see him as a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> prince.</p>
      <p>The dude can act, well (really well) – as evidenced by his incredible performance hosting Saturday Night Live just last night – but does it get any better than his singing and songwriting? And would playing a Disney prince ruin his musical career?</p>
      <p>I fear it certainly has the chance to.</p>
      <p>The star was rumoured to be taking on the Disney Prince role alongside Halle Bailey in the role of Ariel, but that princely title <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/little-mermaid-remake-casts-jonah-hauer-king-prince-eric-harry-styles-rumours-11088301/">has now gone to Jonah Hauer-King</a>.</p>

      <p>Speaking about not stepping into the classic character’s role,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/harry-styles-addresses-why-he-turned-down-prince-eric-role-in-disneys-little-mermaid-remake-11006682/"> Harry said ‘it was a few things’</a> that meant he wasn’t in the final lineup.</p>

      <p>‘Dude, Mel, you idiot, how on Earth can you be happy Harry isn’t playing a Disney prince?’ I hear you say through the screen, yelling at me as you play Watermelon Sugar for the 1265th time today. ‘Do you not want him to be successful or something?’</p>
      <p>Quite the opposite, my dear reader.</p>
      <p>For should he take up the role of a leading Hollywood heartthrob in a Disney adventure, I see no other avenue than for his music career to take a back seat and that’s what the fans are here for, right?</p>
      <p>We didn’t wait two sodding, long years for new tunes just so see him get all lip quivery on the big screen while some watery wench loses her sea legs. (Still, would never say no to some lip quivering…that that’s besides the point.)</p>
      <p>The lad is superhuman, sure, but not even Harry Styles can master a leading Hollywood career as well as one touring the world on the reg and pumping out the most brilliant of tunes. He, and thus, us, cannot have it all.</p>

      <p>So we have to choose. And I choose his epic music career hands down every time.</p>

      <p>Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times.</p>
      <p>Harry in the musical world is allowed to be Harry. In all his unapologetically camp, entertaining, stylish, wordsmith, SNL-hosting glory.</p>
      <p>Should he make the leap to leading man territory, he would be an actor with no real artistic input into the character. And we would find it difficult to separate Harry from what we saw in Eric.</p>
      <p>Which would make things even worse if The Little Mermaid bombs at the box office. For not only are we a little miffed Our Harry wasn’t resembling Our Harry on screens, but we’re angry his film didn’t do as well as we hoped. As well as it<i> should</i> have.</p>
      <p>But most of all, it kills the illusion.</p>
      <p>Harry is what I describe as the male version of the Pixie Manic Dream Girl. You know, that character that infiltrated films in the 00s – mostly your Zooey Deschanel, Kirsten Dunst types – that weaves a whimsical trail of fairy dust behind them.</p>

        <figcaption>Maybe he’s got a big ol’ plan (Picture: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The One Direction star beguiles us with his ‘I’ll tell you everything about me, without actually telling you a thing’ schtick, keeping us willingly hanging on to his every word/lyric/red carpet appearance dangled so rarely in front of us.</p>
      <p>Yes, I know he killed it in Dunkirk back in 2017 but he had yet to reach his latest, perfect form, in his bell-bottomed, painted nails, hosting the Met Gala, owning on Saturday Night Live brilliance.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>He has so much control over his image now and with a film that image threatens to go out the window as he becomes a cog in the big Hollywood machine.</p>
      <p>Hey, I might be so totally wrong here and, deep down, I have no doubt he’d own any role in Hollywood without being pigeonholed – I’d hope, anyway. Because it’s Harry Styles (cue agreeing applause). But a heartthrob is just so…predictable.</p>
      <p>You want the best for Harry, I can only assume, which is why you probably drafted up a totally epic takedown of me on Twitter after you read this headline.</p>
      <p>I just wince at the thought of him taking on the role of an archaic Disney prince when there is a smorgasbord of Harry-centric roles out there to let him shine in his best way possible.</p>
      <p>Let him pass up these opportunities in the knowledge it means it’s all part of his plan for eventual world domination – <i>he</i> only wants the best for <i>us</i>, huns.</p>
