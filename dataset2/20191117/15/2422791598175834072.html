      <h1>Elephant named after bin Laden that killed five people dies in captivity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:03:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author">AFP, Staff</a></address>
      <p>A rogue elephant named after the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has died in captivity after he was captured following a massive hunt in northeastern India, officials said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The male animal -- nicknamed "Laden" -- was tracked for days by forestry officers and tranquilized on Monday after a deadly October rampage killed five villagers in Goalpara, in the northeastern state of Assam.</p>
      <p>It was moved to Assam's Orang National Park where officials planned to teach it to patrol wildlife parks and sanctuaries in the state, but said it died early Sunday.</p>
      <p>"The animal was behaving as normal. It was, however, kept with its legs tied so that it couldn't escape," a park ranger, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP.</p>
      <p>The keeper reported the animal dead at roughly 5:00 a.m. local time Sunday, he said.</p>
      <p>The cause of death was unclear, but a senior official said the state government had sent a team of veterinarians to carry out an autopsy.</p>
      <p>Before the creature's death, the forestry department planned to tame it using "kraak" -- a controversial training regime used on younger elephants and condemned by wildlife conservationists as torture.</p>
      <p>The animal was unsuitable for captivity because it was believed to be about 35 years old, conservationists said.</p>
      <p>Nearly 2,300 people have been killed by elephants in India over the last five years, according to official figures released in June.</p>
      <p>But 700 of the creatures have been killed since 2011, officials said, partly as a result of shrinking natural habitats.</p>
      <p>They frequently migrate into Goalpara, resulting in high numbers of fatal encounters with humans because of rampant deforestation.</p>
      <p>Many have been poisoned or shot by locals, or died on electric fences and railways cutting through migration routes.</p>
