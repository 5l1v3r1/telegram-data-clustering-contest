      <p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has defended petrol price rises that have prompted widespread protests across the country.</p>
      <p>Khamenei told state television that some of those taking part in the demonstrations were enemies of the republic, carrying out sabotage and arson.</p>
      <p>An unknown number of people are believed to have died in street clashes in dozens of cities across the country; the death of at least one policeman has been confirmed by state media.</p>
      <p>Despite the 50 percent rise, at eight litres for one euro petrol prices in Iran are still among the cheapest in the world.</p>
      <p>But the protests are reported to have become political, and internet observers are reporting that networks are running so slow that it amounts to a shutdown.</p>
      <p>The government says it is raising petrol prices in order to provide additional subsidies to low income families.</p>
