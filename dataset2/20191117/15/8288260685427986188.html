      <h1>Birmingham set for bone-chilling Polar Vortex as temperatures plunge to -1C</h1>
      <h2>The mercury is going to plummet to single digits for much of the UK this week with Birmingham expected to see lows of -1°C Monday night into Tuesday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:28:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Brooks, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/katie-brooks/</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham is in for freezing temperatures as a "collapsed polar vortex" is predicted to bring "severe weather" to Europe.</p>
      <p>Snowstorms have ravaged southeast France and meteorologists are warning that it will have a knock-on effect in Britain.</p>
      <p>The mercury is going to plummet to single digits for much of the UK this week with the West Midlands expected to see lows of -1°C Monday night into Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>The Met Office then expects temperatures to start warming up again into the higher single figures as the week progresses.</p>

      <p>Meteorologist Andrej Flis told the   <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1205297/bbc-weather-europe-warning-polar-vortex-snow-winter-floods-snowstorm">Express</a> : “The weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex is well underway.</p>
      <p>“In the past days, the polar vortex reached 40-year record strength for this time of year. It would likely strengthen even further, but its rise to power was stopped and reversed, due to two pressure/temperature waves that press onto the vortex.</p>
      <p>That reduces the speed of the stratospheric polar jet stream.</p>
      <p>“That is a strong sign of a collapsed polar vortex, and high probability of a sudden stratospheric warming event by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“What all this means for our weather? Well, a collapsed vortex always greatly increases the chances for winter weather towards Europe.”</p>
      <h3>3-day Met Office weather forecast</h3>
      <h4>Sunday</h4>
      <p>A mostly cloudy day with the risk of some rain at times and perhaps the odd sunny spell breaking through.</p>

      <h4>Monday</h4>
      <p>It will be a dry day on Monday after a cold start.</p>
      <p>A cloudier morning but it will turn increasingly sunny through the afternoon with maximum temperature 8 °C.</p>
