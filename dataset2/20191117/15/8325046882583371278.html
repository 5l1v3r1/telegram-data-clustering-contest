      <h3>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos’ split after 25 years of marriage was surprising.</h3>

        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In early January, the pair released a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1083004911380393985">statement</a> revealing that “after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.”</p>
      <p>The split was shocking considering the pair’s love story and decades together. They met at the investment management firm D.E. Shaw &amp; Co, dated for three months, got engaged, and wed in 1993.</p>
      <p>“My office was next door to his, and all day long I listened to that fabulous laugh,” MacKenzie recalled during a 2013 interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/a-novel-perspective-mackenzie-bezos">Vogue</a>. “How could you not fall in love with that laugh?”</p>
      <p>In the same interview, Jeff described MacKenzie as “resourceful, smart, brainy, and hot.”</p>
      <p>A year after getting married, the pair quit their jobs and moved to Seattle to create Amazon, which would lead them to become billionaires.</p>
      <p>They finalized their divorce in July and the settlement left MacKenzie with a partial stake in Amazon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mackenzie-bezos-net-worth-one-of-richest-women-in-world-divorce-2019-4">worth an estimated $38 billion</a>, making her the <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeff-mackenzie-bezos-divorce-official-settlement-38-billion-2019-7">third richest woman in the world</a>.</p>

      <h3>Fans were caught off guard by Brie Larson and fiancé Alex Greenwald’s reported split.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In January, <a href="https://people.com/movies/brie-larson-boyfriend-alex-greenwald-end-engagement/">People</a> reported that they ended their engagement.</p>
      <p>“They have taken a step back from their engagement for the time being but they remain close,” a source told the publication.</p>
      <p>The couple didn’t share too many details about their relationship, but they were reportedly together for a few years prior to their <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/763283/brie-larson-is-engaged-oscar-winner-set-to-wed-musician-alex-greenwald">2016 engagement</a>.</p>
      <p>That year when the “Captain Marvel” star won an award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role for “Room” at the SAG Awards, she gave Greenwald a shoutout in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRnD76_Z7wk">acceptance speech</a> and he mouthed the words “I love you, too” from his seat in the audience.</p>
      <p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.etonline.com/awards/sag/181266_exclusive_brie_larson_gushes_over_boyfriend_alex_greenwald_he_just_my_person">“Entertainment Tonight,”</a> Larson also called him “the other half of the equation.”</p>
      <p>“It goes beyond anything. He’s just my person, he’s my best friend,” she said.</p>
      <p>Greenwald also accompanied Larson to other award shows and red carpet premieres and showed support for the actress by wearing a “Captain Marvel” hat and sharing the snap on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk_r4Rknwa3/">Instagram</a>.</p>

      <h3>Adele rose to fame for her chart-topping songs about heartbreak, but her split with husband Simon Konecki was unexpected.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Adele’s representatives shared a statement with the <a href="https://www.apnews.com/e74bd7473e7c4144941511c9abb564ae">Associated Press</a>, saying: “They are committed to raising their son together lovingly. As always they ask for privacy.”</p>
      <p>The “Hello” singer was <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/279446/adele-steps-out-after-throat-surgery">photographed with Konecki in 2011</a> and the couple’s son, Angelo, was <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/singer-adele-welcomes-her-first-child-20122110">born in 2012</a>. The pair remained relatively low-key about their relationship.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Adele gushed over her “supportive” partner in an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/adele-inside-her-private-life-and-triumphant-return-37131/">Rolling Stone</a>. The following year, she told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/10/adele-cover-story">Vanity Fair</a> that Konecki is “not threatened by any stage of my life that I’m going for, and that’s an amazing thing. It’s the most serious relationship I’ve ever been in.”</p>
      <p>“He’s confident. He’s perfect,” she added.</p>
      <p>At the 2017 Grammys, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/13/entertainment/adele-husband-grammys-trnd/">Adele confirmed that she and Konecki got married</a>, referring to him as her “husband” on stage.</p>

      <h3>Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk’s relationship ended a few months after “A Star Is Born” was released.</h3>

        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In early June, <a href="https://people.com/movies/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-split/">People</a> reported that the “Star Is Born” actor and the model <a href="https://www.insider.com/bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk-have-reportedly-split-2019-6">ended their relationship</a>.</p>
      <p>The pair, who <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/bradley-cooper-and-irina-shayk-kiss-in-italy-photo/">reportedly started dating in 2015</a>, have a daughter together named Lea De Seine Shayk Cooper (<a href="https://people.com/parents/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-welcome-daughter-lea-de-seine/">born in 2017</a>). Cooper and Shayk stepped out together at events like the Met Gala and the Oscars, but they were tight-lipped about their romance during interviews.</p>
      <p>However, Cooper did acknowledge Shayk when he <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a26305823/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-baftas-speech/">won a BAFTA for “ASIB” in February 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>“Most of all I have to thank Irina, for putting up with me for all the music I was trying to make in our basement for a year,” Cooper, who starred alongside Lady Gaga in the movie, said.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In July, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/riverdales-cole-sprouse-lili-reinhart-split-after-2-years/">Us Weekly</a> reported that the actors, who star as Betty Cooper and Jughead Jones on the CW show (also known as Bughead), <a href="https://www.insider.com/riverdale-lili-reinhart-cole-sprouse-reportedly-split-2019-7">ended their relationship</a>. An unnamed source also <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1058593/riverdale-s-cole-sprouse-and-lili-reinhart-break-up-after-2-years-of-dating">told “E! News”</a> that they broke up “earlier this summer.”</p>
      <p>The news came as a surprise to fans, especially since the two actors had <a href="https://www.insider.com/riverdale-lili-reinhart-cole-sprouse-relationship-quotes-2019-5">become more open about their relationship</a>. They were also filming season four of “Riverdale” when the reports spread.</p>
      <p>Reinhart and Sprouse went on to slam unnamed “sources” cited by multiple publications. They’ve since commented on each others’ Instagram posts, <a href="https://www.insider.com/riverdale-lili-reinhart-cole-sprouse-breakup-reports-response-twitter-2019-7">trolled breakup reports</a>, and shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4rOlVagqX2/">PDA-filled photos</a>, confirming that they’re still a couple. Reinhart also <a href="https://www.insider.com/lili-reinhart-wrote-cole-sprouse-sappy-love-poem-for-birthday-2019-8">celebrated the former Disney Channel’s star birthday by posting a “sappy” poem on social media</a>.</p>

      <h3>Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus had been on-again, off-again for years, but their split months after getting married was shocking.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Fans were surprised that the pair, who met on the set of 2010’s “The Last Song,” ended their relationship after tying <a href="https://www.insider.com/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-wedding-photos-2018-12">the knot during a low-key ceremony in Tennessee in December 2018</a>. At the time, Hemsworth had <a href="https://www.insider.com/liam-hemsworth-miley-cyrus-intimate-wedding-special-day-video-2019-2">called it “a really special day”</a> and said that <a href="https://www.insider.com/liam-hemsworth-miley-cryus-changed-name-miley-ray-hemsworth-2019-2">Cyrus officially took his last name</a>.</p>
      <p>“Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what’s best while they both focus on themselves and careers,” a representative for Cyrus told <a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split/">People</a> in August. “They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://insider.com/liam-hemsworth-speaks-out-miley-cyrus-split-heartfelt-message-instagram-2019-8">Hemsworth also opened up about the split on Instagram</a>, saying that wished her “nothing but health and happiness going forward” and wouldn’t be commenting further on the breakup.</p>

      <h3>Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were notoriously quiet about their romance, so people probably didn’t predict their reported breakup in 2019.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Speculation about the two stars began in 2013, a year after Holmes and Tom Cruise got divorced. That year, they were seen <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/katie-holmes-dominates-the-dance-floor-in-the-hamptons/">dancing at a party in the Hamptons</a>. For years, representatives for the actors <a href="https://www.etonline.com/news/139589_Jamie_Foxx_Denies_Dating_Katie_Holmes">denied reports about them dating</a>.</p>
      <p>Foxx and Holmes reportedly <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jamie-foxx-celebrates-his-48th-birthday-with-katie-holmes-w159682/">celebrated birthdays together</a> and were <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a12183208/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-public-photos/">photographed holding hands at the beach in 2017</a>. They were last seen together <a href="https://www.insider.com/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-attended-met-gala-together-2019-5">inside the 2019 Met Gala in May</a>. Three months later, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/08/19/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-break-up-after-six-years-together/">Page Six</a> reported that <a href="https://www.insider.com/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-breakup-2019-8">the low-key pair ended their relationship</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-was-the-one-who-ended-things-with-jamie-foxx/">Us Weekly</a>, Holmes ended the romance.</p>
