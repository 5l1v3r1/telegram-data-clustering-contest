      <h2>The big defender took it in good spirits after being compared to Will Ferrell's Buddy character.</h2>

      <p>Rangers defender <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/george-edmundson">George Edmundson</a> has brilliantly responded to a tweet comparing him to Will Ferrell's famous Buddy the Elf character.</p>
      <p>The centre back played for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> Colts on Saturday as they beat Wrexham 2-0 to reach the semi-final of the Tunnock's Caramel Wafer Cup.</p>
      <p>Goals from Jamie Barjonas and Nathan Young-Coombes saw off the Welsh outfit, who are struggling near the bottom of England's National League.</p>
      <p>But it was a picture of Edmundson in the team photo prior to kick-off that sparked some hilarious reactions.</p>
      <p>The 6ft 3in centre back is much bigger than his younger team-mates and the 22-year-old looked huge.</p>
      <p>He wasn't helped by being placed beside diminutive playmaker Kai Kennedy although captain Lewis Mayo - also a centre back and holding midfield player - also looked small beside the former Oldham star.</p>

      <p>One Rangers fan tweeted a comparison of Edmundson to a scene from Elf where Buddy is in a classroom full of kids.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greg-docherty">Greg Docherty</a> found it hilarious and tweeted it to Edmundson, who quickly replied: "Next time I'm standing at the back"</p>
      <p>Edmundson lined up for the Colt side having found first team football hard to get since moving to Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Despite impressing when he has played, he has been unable to move <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/connor-goldson">Connor Goldson,</a> Filip Helander and Niko Katic out of the squad to earn a regular place.</p>
      <p>He last started in the 5-0 win over Hamilton in October, with cameos against Kilmarnock and Aberdeen his only other league appearances.</p>
