      <p>Labour has vowed to bring back free dental check-ups for everybody in England if they win the general election.</p>
      <p>The party has pledged to scrap the £22.70 charge for a basic visit to an NHS dentist, meaning check-ups, oral cancer examinations, X-rays, clinical scaling and polishing and emergency treatment will be free.</p>
      <p>The British Dental Association has estimated the plans will cost £450 million per year.</p>
      <p>Labour say it will free up resources in the long-term by focusing on prevention, with one in five adults currently putting off going to see a dentist because they can’t afford it.</p>
      <p>Dentist Fees were introduced in 1951 to pay for UK involvement in the Korean War.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn says the long term goal is for all NHS dental treatment to be free at the point of use</p>

      <p>He said: ‘More than half of adults and 40 per cent of children haven’t been to the dentist in the last year. If you don’t go for check-ups, you store up problems.</p>

      <p>‘Over 100,000 are admitted to hospital every year because of problems with their teeth.</p>
      <p>‘This is the first step towards making all dentistry services free of charge as part of a truly universally free health service.’</p>
      <p>Labour’s shadow health secretary Johnathon Ashworth said worrying numbers are turning to internet kits for scaling and makeshift fillings, which can cause major problems in the long-run.</p>
      <p>The plans comes on top of the £26bn ‘Rescue Package’ the party has already pledged to save the NHS.</p>
      <p>The party say free dental care would take pressure off both GPs and hospitals.</p>

      <p>Statistics show 515,000 patients with toothache go to GPs or A&amp;E every year– costing the NHS more than £38million.</p>
      <p>Tooth decay is the main reason for hospital admissions among five to nine-year-olds, with more than 100 children a day having their rotting teeth removed in hospital.</p>
      <p>The Labour pledge has been welcomed by British Dental Association chair-man Mick Armstrong.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘When you give patients a reason to avoid check-ups, they bottle up problems and pile huge pressure across our NHS.</p>
      <p>‘Sadly prevention is impossible when families on moderate incomes need to think twice about seeking care.</p>
      <p>‘Dentists are health professionals, not tax collectors. These charges are designed to discourage attendance, while providing cover for government cuts.</p>

      <p>‘However any plans to boost access must go hand in hand with support for a service facing serious recruitment problems. NHS dentistry cannot be delivered without NHS dentists.’</p>

      <p>Labour said the plans would also allow for early detection of signs of oral cancer, which claims more lives than testicular and cervical cancer combined.</p>
      <p>However it has been criticised by the Conservative Party, who say Labour are asking tax payers to ‘foot another bill’.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: ‘Dental check-ups are already free for those who don’t have the means to pay.</p>
      <p>‘Labour’s plans will force taxpayers to foot yet another bill amounting to hundreds of millions pounds, simply to extend provision to people who can already afford it.</p>
      <p>‘Labour’s proposals for a four-day week and uncontrolled immigration would cripple our NHS, leaving it understaffed and underfunded, and we would waste all of next year with two chaotic referendums under Corbyn.’</p>
