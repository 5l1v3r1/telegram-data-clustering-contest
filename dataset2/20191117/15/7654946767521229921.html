      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa injury could be devastating for his NFL Draft stock</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:44:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Post Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa’s hip injury <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/tua-tagovailoas-injury-very-serious-in-major-alabama-blow/">not only ended his season with Alabama</a>, but it could completely ruin his 2020 NFL Draft plans.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/dolphins-quarterback-ryan-fitzpatrick-enjoys-ruining-tank-for-tua-narrative/">“Tank for Tua” narrative</a> may dissipate after Tagovailoa dislocated his right hip on Saturday as it seems unlikely he’d be taken No. 1 overall.</p>
      <p>“The way I would say it is Tua is no longer the lock to be the first pick in the draft as they thought a month ago,” Tony Pauline, NFL draft analyst for ProFootballNetwork.com, told The Post’s Steve Serby.</p>
      <p>The injury could have such an impact that the 21-year-old may have to rethink whether he should go pro in 2020.</p>
      <p>“He’s gotta go back to school,” Pauline told Serby. “You know, the Bo Jackson, the Neil Lomax, the Marvin Jones-type injury where the ball is out of the socket, that’s a significantly damaging injury where he probably shouldn’t even enter the draft. Or if he enters the draft, it could be a situation where he’s not even gonna be a first-round pick or he’s taken late in the first round by a team that’s gonna have to redshirt him.”</p>
