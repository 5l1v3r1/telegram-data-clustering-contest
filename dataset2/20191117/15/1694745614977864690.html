      <p>There are few events that get us excited to shop quite like <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/oprahs-favorite-things-list-2019-46869582">Oprah's Favorite Things.</a> There are so many new goodies that make great gifts for our loved ones, and ourselves, like makeup, cocktail makers, and even a dog collar with built-in GPS. But, as serious lovers of exercise, when we saw that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QHFN536/ref=cm_gf_aaan_iaae_iaag_iaah_d_p0_c0_qd1_______d41Q5jSqWD4IlMKkUN4H?tag=popsugarshopx-20">Flywheel Home Exercise Bike</a> ($1,599, originally $1,999) was being featured at an impressive discount, our jaws hit the floor. Leave it to Oprah to have the best taste in gadgets.</p>
      <p>This bike is the ultimate luxury when it comes to a home gym. If you're not familiar, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Doing-Flywheel-Every-Day-Week-44906317">Flywheel</a> is a national chain of boutique fitness studios that offers indoor cycling, barre, and HIIT classes. With the Flywheel bike, you're getting access to the same classes you would in studio, but you can work out any time, from the comfort of your own home. <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Flywheel-Fly-Anywhere-Bike-Review-44903864">One of our editors tried the bike and fell in love</a>; we don't blame her. This insane deal includes a screen for your bike, free installation, and two months of free workouts. Knowing the power of Oprah, this deal might not be in stock for long, and it really is the dream holiday gift. So, basically, what are you waiting for?</p>
