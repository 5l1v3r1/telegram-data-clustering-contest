      <h1>Sony confirms 8 Xperia smartphones will get the Android 10 update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/arol-wright/" target="_blank">Arol Wright</a></address>
      <p>Android 10, the latest version of Google’s mobile operating system, has been available for over 2 months now. The stable release has already rolled out to all <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel">Google Pixel</a> smartphones and to devices from Essential, Xiaomi, OnePlus, ASUS, and more. Sony’s take on Android is a very light one, with most aspects of its OS being pretty similar to stock Android. Still, they haven’t been as fast as others in rolling out updates, and we’re just now getting official confirmation about when some Sony Xperia smartphones will get the latest Android OS release.</p>
      <p>As you may expect, Sony’s current flagship smartphones, the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-camera-review/">Xperia 1</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-5-hands-on/">Xperia 5</a>, will be first in line for receiving this update, and owners of both devices should be expecting Android 10 to roll out in December, right around holiday time. Owners of other Sony Xperia devices, such as the Xperia 10/10 Plus and older phones, are in for a longer wait. We don’t know <i>exactly</i> how long the wait will be, though, as the expected rollout for these devices is just “early 2020 onwards”, indicating that the update should roll out sometime in the first half of the year.</p>
      <p>The full list of Sony Xperia devices that will be updated is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Xperia 1 – December 2019</li>
        <li>Xperia 5 – December 2019</li>
        <li>Xperia 10 – Early 2020 onwards</li>
        <li>Xperia 10 Plus – Early 2020 onwards</li>
        <li><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-xz2">Xperia XZ2</a> – Early 2020 onwards</li>
        <li><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-xz2-compact">Xperia XZ2 Compact</a> – Early 2020 onwards</li>
        <li>Xperia XZ2 Premium – Early 2020 onwards</li>
        <li>Xperia XZ3 – Early 2020 onwards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Older flagship devices like the Xperia XZ1 were notably excluded from the list, which will understandably be disappointing for users with these devices. Given that this device, in particular, launched with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/android-oreo/">Android 8.0</a> Oreo out of the box, it will only have received a grand total of 1 major OS update (to Android 9 Pie), instead of the 2 major updates we typically see from other smartphone manufacturers.</p>
      <p>Sony’s older devices are still more than technically capable of running a newer Android OS, though. While it is possible to install Android 10 unofficially on these phones—see the XDA forums for advice on that—nothing beats an official update for most people. Other current devices like the Xperia 8, which recently launched with <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/androidpie/">Android Pie</a>, were also oddly excluded. We hope more Sony Xperia phones will get the update and that this is just a preliminary list.</p>
