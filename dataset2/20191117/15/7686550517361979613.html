      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:21:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Thomas</a></address>
      <p>Welsh rugby is set for a massive £35million cash injection as a result of CVC investing in the Guinness PRO14.</p>
      <p>Private equity firm CVC have agreed a deal in principle to buy a 27 per cent share in the cross-border competition for around £120m.</p>
      <p>That follows a similar investment arrangement with England’s Gallagher Premiership, which has received more than £200m.</p>
      <p>The PRO14 is owned by the three Celtic Unions - Wales, Ireland and Scotland - so the lion's share of the money from CVC would go to them, with sides from South Africa and Italy also benefitting.</p>
      <p>That would see as much as £35m coming into the Welsh game as a one-off payment.</p>
      <p>Under the investment deal, which has been in discussion for a number of months, 27 per cent of the tournament’s income would be passed on to CVC each year.</p>
      <p>It will lead to mounting speculation about the possibility of a British &amp; Irish League being set up, as CVC look to maximise their investment in the two existing competitions.</p>
      <p>News of the impending cash boost was revealed at the Welsh Rugby Union’s Annual General Meeting at the Principality Stadium today.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the meeting, WRU chairman Gareth Davies said: “Private equity have invested into the Gallagher Premiership in England, which has obviously created a lot of interest.</p>
      <p>“There’s almost a natural progression to look at the PRO14, I suppose.</p>
      <p>“Discussions are ongoing and and it looks as though that could be moving forward.</p>
      <p>“That would see an inflow of money into Ireland, Scotland and Wales, which is obviously well received.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully there will be some extra funds flowing into our coffers.</p>
      <p>“The money will come into the Union first of all.</p>
      <p>“In England, it’s just gone directly to the clubs, because they were the ones negotiating.</p>
      <p>“We are in discussion with the regions and they will obviously benefit, as will other aspects of the game.</p>
      <p>“The regions will benefit, while some of that money will go to the community game and potentially the women’s game, as we have many hungry mouths to feed.”</p>
      <p>On the principle of such a deal, Davies said: “We are not selling part of the Unions, we are selling a competition, the commercial arm of the competition.</p>
      <p>“The game itself, the rugby element, will still be controlled by the Unions and the professional teams.</p>
      <p>“It’s an interesting departure and development. Rugby isn’t always good at working together, in terms of the best results, because there are lots of areas of self-interest.</p>
      <p>“So it probably needs an external partner to come in and knock heads together in many respects and to more commercialise what is probably regarded as an under-exploited sport in terms of commercialism.”</p>
      <p>Celtic Rugby, who own the PRO14, have tonight issued the following statement on the subject.</p>
      <p>It reads: "Celtic Rugby and its shareholders can confirm that a request has been filed to the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for Merger and Acquisition clearance by CVC Capital Partners.</p>
      <p>"The request has been made in relation to a potential transaction involving Celtic Rugby and CVC Capital Partners.</p>
      <p>"Both parties are involved in advanced discussions and until those talks have been finalised there will be no further comment."</p>

      <p>In another development from today’s AGM, it’s been revealed that Liza Burgess will become the first woman to be elected to the WRU board by the member clubs in its 138-year history.</p>
      <p>Former Wales player and coach Burgess, who won 87 caps, joined the WRU Council at the AGM after winning recent club elections.</p>
      <p>And she is now the only candidate standing for the position of WRU director on the board, a post vacated by the retiring Anthony Buchanan.</p>
      <p>She will be formally elected as a WRU director next Tuesday at a meeting chaired by new WRU president Gerald Davies.</p>
      <p>Former Wales and Lions winger Davies is taking over from Dennis Gethin, who bowed out at the AGM after 12 years in the role.</p>
