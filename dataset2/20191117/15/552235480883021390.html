      <h1>Dario Del Fabro's debt to ex-Rangers star Rino Gattuso as he hails Scottish football</h1>
      <h2>The 24-year-old joined Kilmarnock on a seaosn long loan deal and revealed why he's a fan of Scottish football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:47:48+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Dario Del Fabro has admitted his loan move to Kilmarnock came about after learning about Scottish football from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rino-gattuso">Rino Gattuso.</a></p>
      <p>Gattuso spent a year at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> in 1997/98 and Del Fabro reckons that he owes his career to that time in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Del Fabro played under Gattuso during a loan spell from Cagliari at Pisa in 2016/17 before moving to Juventus.</p>
      <p>And chats with the 41-year-old AC Milan legend is what prompted his interest in Scottish football.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the former Rangers midfielder, he told the Times: "It was here that he became a man, became a player."</p>
      <p>Having had loan spells in the second tier of Italian football, Del Fabro wanted to try something different and the 24-year-old moved to Scotland.</p>

      <p>He's impressed at the heart of defence for the Rugby Park club and admits the style of football suits him.</p>
      <p>He said: "In Serie B, everyone knows me and I know everyone. I wanted to try something different and find a new challenge.</p>
      <p>"The Scottish league I know very well thanks to Gattuso, but I'd also followed it myself and knew it had been a great launch pad for many great players. I knew <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> was one of the oldest and most important clubs and I've found out that the fans are very warm but also quite demanding.</p>
      <p>"These things have been frustrating and in the matches where we've had half a defence we've struggled a bit but my time in Scotland has already been a big step forward for me.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps in Italy there is a little bit more quality, but the game here is a lot more dynamic. There's a lot more energy, a lot more aggression. Italian football is very slow and tactical, whereas here you can't breathe for even a second and I'm loving it."</p>

      <p>Killie started the season terribly under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Angelo Alessio</a> but have turned it around and being a tougher team to face.</p>
      <p>And the centre back has an interesting comparison for Kilmarnock's players as he said: "We're very compact and the whole team knows how to defend. We can make quick attacks but our strength is our compactness. We're like bricklayers. We do a dirty, hard job, but it's getting results.</p>
      <p>"I'm loving it here, so maybe the boss will speak about it with the club and with Juventus and we'll see what happens. The career of a footballer is very strange because in a year anything can happen and many things can change."</p>
