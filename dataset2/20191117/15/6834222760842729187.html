        <b>Radio box says that there's already an Alpinestars suit with the Repsol colors ready for Alex Marquez.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Could be. <b>After all, it wouldn't be at all strange if Marc's brother tried the RC213-V next Tuesday</b>, having already been on it, right here in Valencia, the day after his world title in the Moto3, in 2014.</p>
      <p>It was a brief test, a gift from Honda, which many saw as an actual preview for the future. But it was too early, and Marc's triumphant journey with HRC had just begun.</p>
      <p><b>Today, honored by glory, Magic Marc has a say in the Honda</b>, and even if he's been repeating himself for days that he will not enter negotiations, the happiness he feels knowing his brother's name was added among those that include Crutchlow and Johann Zarco as a possible teammate showed in his eyes.</p>
      <h3>Marquez: "Alex is on the list of candidates as my teammate because he deserves it."</h3>
      <p><i>"He got there because he deserves it. He won two world championships," </i>the eight-time world champion said, adding<i>: " There is no reason for Alex to be worried about the pressure of being my brother. That exists anyway. As for me, I'm a professional. My goal is to win, whoever my teammate is."</i></p>
      <p><b>The affair, however, is far from</b> <b>over</b>, at the moment. For his negotiations, Zarco relied on <b>Claude Michy,</b> an important promoter of the French Le Mans Grand Prix and has Carmelo Ezpeleta's promise that he would like to keep him in the MotoGP.</p>
      <p>At the same time, former world champion, <b>Emilio Alzamora -</b> manager for both of the Marquez brothers - agrees with the sponsor, Repsol, for what would be a real dream team for the Spaniards, on a media level.</p>
      <h3>Marc wouldn't skimp on advice for Alex, his younger brother</h3>
      <p><b>After all, the inevitable confrontation with his older brother would be partly diluted by the fact that Marc wouldn't skimp on advice for his younger brother</b>. Even if he's also well aware of the problems.</p>
      <p><i>"I know that Honda is one of the most difficult bikes to ride in the MotoGP, but I think Alex is ready," "</i> Magic" reaffirmed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But what are the other options?</b>
      </p>
      <h3>For Puig, Cal Crutchlow is the right rider: he already has a contract with Honda</h3>
      <p><b>Alberto Puig would like</b> <b>Cal Crutchlow alongside Marc</b>. It's true. <b>Cal has always been a whiz, but Jorge Lorenzo was also</b> <b>one before joining Honda</b>. So, the problem of a personal sponsor can be forgotten. The advantage of moving Crutchlow is that it would simply be a matter of continuing his contract with Honda, which expires at the end of 2020. Subsequently, the British rider could, as he has often anticipated, withdraw, freeing up a place for 2021.</p>
      <h3>Hypothesis 2: Alex Marquez parked in Lucio Cecchinello's LCR team</h3>
      <p>In this case, Alex Marquez would be "parked" in Lucio Cecchinello's LCR team, certainly a more protected environment and, with Marc's approval in 2020, Honda could line up four official bikes, like Yamaha and Ducati. Instead<b>, Nakagami's situation - </b>that during the second half of the LCR garage carries the Idemitsu sponsor - is more difficult.</p>
      <h3>Zarco refused the Ducati-Avintia alternative: "I'd rather go back to the Moto2"</h3>
      <p>And Zarco? <b>The French rider was teased with the idea but, soon after, he was offered a Ducati in the Avintia team</b>, which Johann disdainfully refused, regardless of the quality of the bike in question, reiterating that he would prefer, at this point, to try to win the title for the third time in the Moto 2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>There is no doubt, however, that even the Ducati followed suit, since it maybe seems the most needy of reinforcing its team at the moment.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Having failed the team's goal, the Ducati has to reinforce itself</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>The<i>"team of friends" </i>project created last year - after getting rid of Jorge Lorenzo and having hired Danilo Petrucci - miserably failed</b>. What should have been a leading team that would increase victories (Dovi's 4, Jorge's 3 in 2019), instead turned out to be a weaker team. Maybe because a rather not very stimulated Andrea appeared duller this year.</p>
      <p>That's why <b>there's been talk of a Jack Miller-Danilo Petrucci exchange for the past several months.</b> The Australian is determined, aggressive and, even if he's not that much better than Petrux from a results perspective, there are those in Ducati who see him as a necessary stimulus for Dovizioso.</p>
      <h3>Marco Melandri's return: he'd like to race in the MotoE and will try it in Valencia</h3>
      <p>In short, there's a lot on the managers' plates for this season's finale. Incidentally, but something that has nothing to do with the MotoGP, <b>Marco Melandri will also be back on a bike in Valencia on Monday. He'll be riding a MotoE. </b>It'll be more than just a show. The rider from Ravenna might, in fact, race in the new championship in 2020.</p>
