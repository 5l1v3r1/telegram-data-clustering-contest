      <p>Turner said, “I think along with most people, I find the president’s tweets generally, unfortunate, but let’s state this, I think it’s important about this, and that is that Adam Schiff has been on a three-year request to impeach the president.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “It’s certainly not impeachable. It’s certainly not criminal. It certainly was not witness intimidated. It certainly wasn’t trying to prevent [Yovanovitch] or would it prevent her from testifying. She was actually in the process of testifying. Nonetheless, I find the president tweets unfortunate.”</p>
      <p>He added. “She was in no means intimidated  and prevented from testifying.”</p>
