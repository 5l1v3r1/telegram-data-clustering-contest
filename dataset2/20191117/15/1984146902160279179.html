      <p>A familiar face wherever he went, popular <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mark-connelly-bigg-market-death-17244599">Mark Connelly</a> could alway be sure of a warm welcome whenever he stepped into a pub in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>But today, one week on from his sudden death, the 50-year-old's home life remains a mystery.</p>
      <p>Mark was pronounced dead after collapsing on the Bigg Market, on Monday night.</p>
      <p>There was shock and tears around pubs in Newcastle city centre last week as news of Mark's death spread among the legions of friends he made there.</p>
      <p>Yet, despite being well known to almost all of the staff and regulars at the Rose and Crown, The Duke of Northumberland, The Beehive and other bars, Mark's many friends are struggling to trace any family members they can pass their condolences onto.</p>
      <p>So far generous customers at the Duke of Northumberland, also known as The Clock, have donated several hundred pounds to be passed on to Mark's loved ones.</p>
      <p>And now bar manager Joseph Chappell is trying to piece together Mark's life in the hop he can trace his relatives.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old said: "We have had lots of customers donating money, there's a few hundred pound in there now. I'm going to have to ring the police to find out if there is any family we can donate it to.</p>
      <p>"But I think his friends were his family."</p>
      <p>It is understood Mark, whose real name is John, had been out for a drink with a pal when he collapsed while walking from the Beehive to the Rose and Crown, at around 5.30pm last Monday.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses said passing police officers attempted to revive him, but nothing could be done to save his life and he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Following his death pub <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mark-connelly-bigg-market-death-17244599">staff and customers paid tribute to Mark</a> , who is thought to be from the Felling area of Gateshead</p>
      <p>Mary McDaid, 45, from Fenham, who works behind the bar at The Clock, said: “He was in here nearly every day. Everybody knew him.</p>
      <p>And Rose and Crown customer Bill Irwing, 75, from Benwell said: “He was one of the city’s biggest characters without a doubt. He was very well liked. He was always happy. He will be a big miss.”</p>
      <p>And Lynne Wright, 60, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gosforth">Gosforth</a> , who works at The Clock added:  “He was just happy-go-lucky. He liked to sing and dance. If anyone was short of money, he would buy them a pint. He will be a miss, he really will.”</p>
      <p>Joseph said there had been a sombre atmosphere in his pub since mark's death.</p>
      <p>He added: "Everyone has been gutted. We have had people crying in here."</p>
