      <h2>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is on the comeback trail and warned scouts who attended his private workout on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:43:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick has warned NFL owners to "stop being scared" after his open workout on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Controversial quarterback Kaepernick, formerly of the San Francisco 49ers, has not featured in the NFL since 2016.</p>
      <p>He has been without a team since leaving the 49ers having hit the headlines for leading the protest which saw him and other players kneel for the national anthem before games to take a stand against racism.</p>
      <p>He held an open workout on Saturday, but it was not without drama as he abandoned an NFL-arranged private workout at the last minute to stage his own session at a nearby high school.</p>
      <p>He claimed NFL denied media access so he took matters into his own hands, with representatives from the New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Tennessee Titans, Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions all in attendence.</p>
      <p>After the workout, he warned scouts: “When you go back, tell your owners to stop being scared.”</p>

      <p>Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL in November 2017, accusing the league and it's owners of collusion to keep him out of the league.</p>
      <p>The grievance was withdrawn in February 2019 after he reached a confidential settlement with the NFL and he is now on the comeback trail.</p>
      <p>The NFL claimed they were "disappointing" with the 32-year-old for his late venue switch, stating on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>:  “Kaepernick was a no-show for 25 NFL teams at Falcons facility waiting at 3pm.”</p>

      <p>After completing his workout, in which anonymous scouts reportedly claimed he was "average" but at the level of back-up quarterbacks in the league, he discussed his decision.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick told reporters: "Our biggest thing was making sure we had transparency in what went on.</p>
      <p>"We weren't getting that elsewhere, so we came out here. It's important you're all here [the media]. You've all been attacked for the last three years, you continue to be attacked. We appreciate what you all do.</p>

      <p>"I've been ready for three years - I've been denied for three years.</p>
      <p>"We have nothing to hide. So we're waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell, to stop running. Stop running from the truth, stop running from the people.</p>
      <p>"My agent is ready to talk to any team; I'll continue to be ready.</p>
      <p>"We'll let you know if we hear from them. The ball is in their court. We're ready to go."</p>
