      <p>Some long-serving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> staff members are reportedly shocked by the number of changes that have taken place since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsene-wenger/">Arsene Wenger</a>’s departure, with the club almost unrecognisable.</p>
      <p>The Gunners currently sit in sixth place in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> table, with the pressure heating up on Unai Emery after a run of four games without a league win coupled with sub-par performances throughout the season.</p>
      <p>Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi has publically backed Emery, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/unai-emery-month-save-job-20895792">The Mirror</a> report that a number of people behind the scenes feel the club’s issues extend far beyond the manager.</p>

      <p>Sanllehi and technical director Edu have rung the changes since taking up their positions, removing a number of key personnel who served under Wenger.</p>
      <p>Steve Morrow is the latest high-profile casualty, with the head of recruitment axed in a massive shake-up of the academy, while chief scout Steve Rowley was similarly shown the door two years ago.</p>

      <p>The majority of Wenger’s old backroom have now left, while others – like former assistant manager Steve Bould – have been demoted.</p>
      <p>Long-serving members are ‘shocked by what’s happening to the club’, with the wholesale changes eroding the ‘DNA’ Wenger had spent so long establishing.</p>
      <p>Morrow’s exit has not gone down well, with the former Gunner deemed to be a huge loss and someone who had the potential to rise up through the ranks.</p>

      <p>The jury is still out on Arsenal’s hierarchy, but there is a feeling that they should share some of the blame for Arsenal’s struggles – not Emery alone.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Spanish coach is believed to have only a few games left to turn things around and cannot afford any slip ups against Southampton, Norwich, Brighton or West Ham despite Arsenal wanting to hold out and reassess his position in the summer.</p>
