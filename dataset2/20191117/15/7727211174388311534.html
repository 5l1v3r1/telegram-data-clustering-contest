      <h2>The ex-Reds striker is now the manager of Australian club Brisbane Roar</h2>

      <p>Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler claimed another victory for the Reds over <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The former England striker took charge of Brisbane Roar in the summer, his first foray into management.</p>
      <p>A second-half comeback at the weekend saw them claim their first A-League win of the season.</p>
      <p>The opponents? Melbourne City, the sister club of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> Premier League title rivals Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The Roar trailed 3-1 on Sunday afternoon when Socceroos striker Jamie Maclaren completed a hat-trick on his return from a hamstring injury, but Irishman Roy O’Donovan’s own hat-trick secured Brisbane’s first win of the campaign.</p>
      <p>A win seemed unlikely when Maclaren’s first-half double in front of a near-capacity crowd of 9,387 at Redcliffe’s Dolphin Stadium gave City a 2-0 half-time lead.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/robbie-fowler">Fowler</a> switched the Roar to three at the back during the break and the tactical switch paid dividends, with O’Donovan ending a 320-minute goal drought early in the second half before twice scoring from the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>Aaron Amadi-Holloway scored the other goal for Brisbane, the Welsh marksman bundling home from close range in the 60th minute for his first A-League strike.</p>
      <p>“If you didn’t know that our team and our players have got character, I think we’ve shown it in abundance with that second-half performance,” Fowler said after the full-time whistle, delighted with his side's unlikely comeback against the league leaders.</p>
      <p>“I thought we were quite incredible. To score four goals against the league leaders ... it sure shows you that we’ve got a little bit about us.”</p>
      <p>That victory leaves Brisbane seventh in the league 11-team league on 5 points, whilst Melbourne remain top of the division despite the weekend defeat.</p>
