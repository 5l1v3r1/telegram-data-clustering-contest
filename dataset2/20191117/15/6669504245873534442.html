      <p>Even after ripping out 68 illegal mooring buoys in Shuswap and Mara lakes earlier this fall, Transport Canada has more work to do.</p>
      <p>“For the past seven years, Transport Canada has been removing non-compliant buoys in British Columbia’s waterways in response to public concern that many mooring buoys are non-compliant.,” states an email to iNFOnews.ca from Annie Joannette, Transport Canada’s senior communications officer.</p>
      <p>“About 600 buoys were tagged with a notice in the North Shuswap area in May this year, and 68 buoys were removed from Mara Lake and Shuswap Lake.”</p>
      <p>Those numbers vary a bit from what the <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/over-50-illegal-buoys-pulled-from-shuswap-lakes/it67322">Columbia-Shuswap Regional District announced on Nov. 4</a>, which said 53 buoys were removed.</p>
      <p>Since the buoys don’t contain owner information, Transport Canada cannot try to recover costs for removal.</p>
      <p>“Transport Canada is planning trips for next year, and anticipates visiting the Shuswap area, as well as Wood Lake and Kalamalka next spring,” Joannette wrote.</p>
      <p>“It is the owner’s responsibility to ensure that their buoys meet the specific requirements of the Private Buoy Regulations, and non-compliant buoys can be removed at any time.”</p>
      <p>
