      <h1>Murphy: Ukrainians 'always going to try to put a good spin on this'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:01:12+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-murphy">Chris Murphy</a> (D-Conn.) said Sunday that Ukrainian officials are "going to try to put a good spin on" interactions with President <a href="https://thehill.com/person/trump">Trump</a>, as the country is still reliant on the U.S. for its safety. </p>
      <p>"Ukrainians are always going to try to put a good spin on this," Murphy said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." </p>
      <p>His answer was in response to Ukraine's <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/470415-top-ukrainian-official-sondland-did-not-explicitly-link-aid-to">foreign minister</a> telling reporters last week that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> did not link requests for investigations into Trump's political rival to military assistance. </p>
      <p>Republicans have jumped on the statement as proof there was no quid pro quo in Trump's dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"They are presently reliant on the goodwill of Donald Trump in order to keep that country safe," Murphy said. </p>
      <p>"Nobody should be surprised when the Ukrainians are trying to put as good a spin on this as possible," he added. </p>
      <p>Murphy said Ukraine has to "stay in the president's good graces" as Trump still "holds enormous leverage" over Ukraine's safety and sovereignty. </p>
      <p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters, "Sondland did not tell us, and did not tell me exactly, about the relation between the [military] assistance and the investigations."</p>
      <p>"I have never seen a direct link between investigations and security assistance. Yes, investigations were mentioned, you know, in a presidential conversation. But there was no clear connection between these events," Prystaiko added.</p>
