        <b>Tommy Fleetwood beat Marcus Kinhult in a play-off to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge at Sun City in South Africa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fleetwood started the final round six shots off the lead but carded a seven-under 65 to finish on 12 under par, which Swede Kinhult matched with a 68.</p>
      <p>The Englishman, who had three eagles during his round, then made a brilliant par on the first extra hole to win.</p>
      <p>It was the 28-year-old's first victory since January 2018 and moved him up to second in the Race to Dubai.</p>
      <p>That last victory came as he defended the Abu Dhabi Invitational in January 2018. Since then, Fleetwood has had three runners-up finishes, including at the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/44515922">2018 US Open</a> to Brooks Koepka, and at this year's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/49064754">Open</a> to Shane Lowry at Royal Portrush.</p>
      <p>"It's really, really cool when you win a tournament," he told Sky Sports. "And it's great for the people who go on the journey with you."</p>
      <p>Fleetwood's 65 was three shots better than anyone else on Sunday and in the play-off he produced a magnificent up-and-down to ensure his par beat Kinhult's bogey to take home the largest monetary prize on the European Tour - $2.5m (£1.93m).</p>
      <p>He is now second behind Austria's Bernd Wiesberger in the Race to Dubai standings, with only one event to go - the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.</p>
      <p>The Ryder Cup player is chasing his second victory in that, having won it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/42042750">in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's an absolute privilege to have a chance of winning the Race to Dubai," added Fleetwood. "It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my career.</p>
      <p>"I will start thinking about next week down the line. But I'm happy for the challenge. I may play terribly but I feel very ready."</p>
      <p>The tournament winner in Dubai next Sunday will receive $3m (£2.32m), and the overall winner of the Race to Dubai will get an extra $2m from a bonus pool of $5m, which will be shared out between the top five in the final standings.</p>

        <figcaption>Robert MacIntyre would become the first Scot since Marc Warren in 2006 to win the European Tour's Rookie of the Year award</figcaption>

      <h3>MacIntyre leads the way to be Rookie of the Year</h3>
      <p>Wiesberger ended in a tie for third alongside Jason Scrivener of Australia and Thomas Detry of Belgium, but four shots adrift of Fleetwood and Kinhult.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, from Vienna, dropped three shots in his final four holes to slip out of contention.</p>
      <p>England's Lee Westwood finished joint sixth, while Scotland's Robert MacIntyre hit an excellent 68 to follow his 65 on Saturday to end in a tie for eighth, his seventh top-10 finish in his debut season on the European Tour.</p>
      <p>It also meant the 23-year-old leapfrogged Kurt Kitayama of the USA in the race for the Tour's prestigious Rookie of the Year title.</p>
      <p>"Winning the Rookie of the Year would mean everything," he said. "That would be unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Overnight leader Zander Lombard of South Africa finished alongside MacIntyre after finishing with a five-over 77.</p>
