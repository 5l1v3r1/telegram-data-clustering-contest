      <p>We are still two weeks away from Black Friday but the deals have already started pouring in. The most notable one is from <a href="https://www.walmart.com/">Walmart</a> which is currently offering the 15.6-inch Acer Chromebook 715 at $300 which is $100 less than its normal $400 price tag.</p>
      <p>The Acer Chromebook 715(CB715-1WT-39HZ) features an all aluminium chassis with MIL-STD 810G certification for durability against accidental drops. Also, it is powered by Intel Core i3 dual-core CPU coupled with 4GB DDR4 RAM and 128GB eMMC storage. It also sports a 15.6-inches FHD(1920 x 1080 pixels) IPS LCD touchscreen panel with a full-size backlit keyboard along with a number pad.Â </p>
      <p>As for connectivity, it comes with all the essential ports including 1 x USB Type-A and 2 x USB Type-C. Users can even expand the storage if needed via a microSD card slot that is present on the device. The laptop weighs 3.97 lbs with a battery that can provide up to 10 hours of usage according to the company. Last but not least, the ChromOS support on the device ends in June 2025 and can run Android and Linux applications as well.</p>
      <p>In case you are in the market for a budget Chromebook, this is the best deal you can get as of now and we urge you to not miss it. This is hands down one of the best packages available at a stellar price of $300.</p>
