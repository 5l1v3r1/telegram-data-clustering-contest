      <h2>Craig Lonsdale spent weeks in hospital after a random seizure left him debilitated and with memory loss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/max-clements/" target="_blank">Max Clements</a></address>
      <p>A previously fit and healthy husband had to learn to eat and walk again after he suffered a seizure while out shopping with his wife. </p>
      <p>Craig Lonsdale, 45, originally from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Southport</a>, was shopping with his wife Jacky six months ago in Dubai when he fell to the ground convulsing in the middle of the street.</p>
      <p>He suffered a second seizure while in hospital that was so severe he needed to be sedated and suffered internal bleeding.</p>
      <p>Craig was left in a wheelchair needing 24-hour care from his wife Jacky. </p>
      <p>Doctors told his family that the seizures had damaged his cerebellum, the part of the brain that regulates motor control including the body's movements and reflexes.</p>
      <p>He said: "I can't remember what happened. I just remember waking up in an ambulance on the main road.</p>

      <p>"I remember a few things about being in hospital but my memory is really patchy. It's quite disturbing looking at photos and videos from when I was in hospital.</p>
      <p>"I was all over the place for about a month. I couldn't walk or talk or even hold food for two months. It would take me a long time to even eat a biscuit.</p>
      <p>"My wife became my career. I was wearing adult diapers and I had no idea where I was. She cared for me 24 hours a day. "</p>
      <p>Jacky gave up her job as an on-board manager for Emirates to care for her husband after he was discharged from hospital.</p>
      <p>She said: "We both had a day off and we were out running errands when it happened.</p>
      <p>"When we were out shopping he kept saying he needed air and that he felt claustrophobic.</p>
      <p>"We said we'd meet each other back at the car but when I got to the car I couldn't see him. I marched off to try and find him and that's when I saw Craig lying on the floor convulsing with a crowd of people gathered around him.</p>
      <p>"He'd vomited and bit his tongue so he was choking on his blood. I gave him CPR we went to hospital.</p>

      <p>"He had another seizure in hospital. After that he had to be restrained and sedated. We spent three weeks like this in hospital.</p>
      <p>Jacky said after three weeks the doctors said there was nothing more they could do for Craig medically.</p>
      <p>"I pushed him out of the hospital doors in a wheelchair and they gave me some adult diapers for him," she said.</p>
      <p>"He couldn't feed himself, go to the toilet or bathe himself. I could tell that he was very frustrated that I had to help him with everything. Craig's very stubborn and independent so he would get irritated when I had to help him.</p>
      <p>"But he progressed day by day. When I got him home it took about a month for him to become independent again. He has pushed himself beyond what was expected in his recovery.</p>
      <p>"He has some lasting memory loss from the seizures, mainly short term memory loss.</p>

      <p>"He often eats and then ten minutes later will ask if he's had dinner because he has forgotten. We often spend time together where we recap the day."</p>
      <p>Since his horrendous ordeal, Craig has battled to regain his strength and fitness through exercise.</p>
      <p>Craig has long been interested in keeping active and competed in the the first Tough Mudder race in the UK with his best friend in 2013.</p>
      <p>Last month Craig completed the Abu Dhabi Tough Mudder event, demonstrating the extent of his recovery and how far he has come in the space of six months.</p>
      <p>Craig said: "I've got a passion inside me to rebuild my life.</p>
      <p>"It's still a journey for me to be honest. I'm using running as exercise to help my recovery, it frees my mind and it helps.</p>
      <p>"I give myself goals and targets to aim for them. That's why I do the tough mudder.</p>

      <p>"Exercise really helps me. I don't know how to explain it but it releases my mind. I've suffered a lot from anxiety. When I run it frees up the anxiety.</p>
      <p>"If I can just inspire one person who's going through a tough time with a disability or who's been in an accident, I would be so happy with that."</p>
      <p>Craig's sister Karen Lonsdale, from Southport, helped to fund Craig's medical bills by setting up a crowdfunding page after his medical insurance stopped when he left his job.</p>
      <p>She told the ECHO: "It was so upsetting watching him go through that.</p>
      <p>"I would speak to his wife everyday on the phone and I would speak to him too.</p>
      <p>"He never forgot who I was. I would ask him about his recovery.</p>
      <p>"He's the most stubborn man I know. He's so determined. He's been called the most stubborn man in the world."</p>
