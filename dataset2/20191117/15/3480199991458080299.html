      <p>Black Eyed Peas musician will.i.am has accused a flight attendant from Australia’s national carrier Qantas of being racist and rude to him on a flight.</p>
      <p>The musician said he was met by police at Sydney Airport on Saturday after an incident with an “overly aggressive flight attendant”.</p>
      <p>He said the airline staff member was upset with him because he could not hear her through his noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
      <p>The singer tweeted a photo of a police officer and said: “This is how your greeted when you land from Brisbane to Sydney flying @qantas with a #RacistFlightattendant.”</p>
      <p>He then named the flight attendant.</p>
      <p>Qantas said in a statement: “There was a misunderstanding on board, which seems to have been exacerbated by will.i.am wearing noise-cancelling headphones and not being able to hear instructions from crew.”</p>
      <p>“We’ll be following up with will.i.am and wish him well for the rest of the tour.”</p>
      <p>He and the Black Eyed Peas are in Australia to perform as part of a world tour.</p>
      <p>In other tweets, will.i.am said he wasn’t the only person on the flight to be “disrespected”.</p>
      <p>Some Twitter users who said they were passengers on the flight agreed with him.</p>
      <p>He did, however, get criticised by some who felt it was inappropriate for him to publicly name the flight attendant on his Twitter account, which has 12.8 million followers.</p>
      <p>“I don’t regret my actions,” he said, adding in another tweet that “today I FELT discrimination … and I spoke for all the other people who are voiceless.”</p>
