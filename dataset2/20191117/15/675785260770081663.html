      <h1>Gemma Collins and Arg prove they are back on as they unite for tile shop birthday party</h1>
      <h2>The couple have had more up and downs than a rollercoaster but appear to be back on for good</h2>

      <p>It's been quite the rollercoaster ride for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma Collins</a> and James 'Arg' Argent but it appears they're back on solid ground.</p>
      <p>The on-off on-off on-off couple may have broken up more times than we can keep count of, but they seem destined to be together.</p>
      <p>After a brief split, Gemma and Arg, 31, proved they were meant for each other as they reunited for an appearance at the one year birthday party of a local tile shop in Essex.</p>
      <p>Not as glamorous as the red carpets of the ITV Palooza which Gemma recently attended, but clearly not below the reality stars who looked happily in love.</p>

      <p>Gemma, 38, was the perfect mix of high street and designer as she dressed down in a lilac tracksuit and jacket, topped off with a Dior headband and Chanel handbag.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Arg sported his trademark cardigan and shirt in navy, teamed with a pair of cream trousers and bright red trainers.</p>
      <p>He had a sheepish grin on his face as he walked behind a beaming Gemma.</p>

      <p>The pair delighted fans after they went away together to Dubai for a romantic break.</p>
      <p>They had a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/obese-james-arg-eats-cheesecake-20879433">flirty exchange on Instagram</a> after Arg uploaded a snap from their mini holiday and boasted about happiness.</p>
      <p>He shared a snap of himself at The Cheesecake Factory with the caption: "The pursuit of happiness," with a heart and Gemma penned a comment back saying: "You was staring at cheesecake here!!!!"</p>

      <p>His sweet caption could be a hint at Gemma, who didn't approve, and instead blamed him for eyeing up the cheesecake over her.</p>
      <p>Followers found her witty remark funny, and one penned back to her: "Howling," followed by a line of laughing faces.</p>
      <p>It seems their on-off romance could finally be back on track again following his recent 'overdose' drama.</p>
