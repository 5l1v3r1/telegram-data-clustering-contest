      <p>The Inamorata Woman entrepreneur looked elegant and distinguished in an off-white minidress that showed her long, lean legs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/emily-ratajkowski/">Emily Ratajkowski</a> had all eyes on her as she arrived at the GO Campaign gala on Saturday night. The gorgeous supermodel rocked the red carpet at the swanky NeueHouse event in a simple off-white minidress, looking chic and sophisticated in the figure-hugging number.</p>
      <p>Photos published today by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7694319/Emily-Ratajkowski-Paris-Hilton-lead-stars-sparkling-childrens-charity-gala-Hollywood.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a> showed the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> babe posing up a storm at the ritzy location as she snuggled up the her movie producer husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard. Emily put her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5746793/emily-ratajkowski-pepper-suit/">hourglass curves</a> on full display in the thigh-skimming dress, flashing her endless pins for the cameras. The chic look called attention to her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5743487/emily-ratajkowski-braless/">chiseled legs</a>, while also emphasizing her round hips and tiny waistline.</p>
      <p>The short bodycon dress featured a high-cut straight neckline that kept the look classy and refined. As such, the focus was on Emily’s toned, supple legs. At the same time, the flattering garment was a sleeveless design that left Emily’s slender, muscular arms exposed. This ensured that the London-born beauty showed just enough skin to keep her look tasteful and elegant, without baring her cleavage.</p>
      <p>The <i>Sports Illustrated: Swimsuit Edition</i> model added height to her statuesque frame with an exquisite pair of stiletto heels — a strappy Gladiator design in a contrasting black color, which wrapped around her ankles with a delicate, understated bow. The elegant open-toed footwear exposed Emily’s chic French tip pedicure, which perfectly matched her manicure in a stylish display that complemented the tone of her attire.</p>

      <p>In keeping with the simple, elegant tone of her outfit, Emily kept the accessories to a minimum. The stunning <i>Vogue</i> model added a hint of glitz to her attire with a single sparkling ring on her finger and wore a thin, understated bracelet around her wrist. The gorgeous brunette carried a shiny black purse that matched her eye-catching heels, while also adding a tiny splash of color with a bright-red leather detail.</p>

      <p>Her glam was equally feminine and discreet. Emily highlighted her naturally beautiful features with a shimmering skin-toned eyeshadow and a touch of dark eyeliner. She also sported perfectly a applied mascara that made her deep brown eyes pop. Her makeup also included a bronze blush, as well as a tan lip gloss that plumped up her luscious pillowy lips, making them appear even fuller.</p>
      <p>Emily kept things simple with her hairstyle as well. The 27-year-old hottie wore her dark tresses with a mid-part, letting her locks frame her face as they fell down her back and over her shoulders in a relaxed style.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, her husband looked dapper in an elegant black suit and black suede shoes. Sebastian wore his dinner jacket open, sporting a simple white shirt underneath — which he wore with the collar undone.</p>
