      <h2>Prince Andrew has been on the receiving end of social media backlash following his BBC Newsnight interview - and Carol Vorderman is unconvinced</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T15:01:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/carol-vorderman">Carol Vorderman</a> has added her own scathing comments as she waded into the backlash against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew</a> .</p>
      <p>During his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-interview-read-full-20898538">BBC Newsnight interview</a> with Emily Maitlis centred around his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein - which has since been branded "disastrous" - the former Countdown star poured scorn on the royal.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets a "shocked" Carol wrote that the 45-minute interview was "car crash" viewing and she was left floored at the series of statements the Queen's third child made.</p>
      <p>"I'm truly so shocked that my brain is saying 'you didn't just see or hear what you think you just saw and heard'... #PrinceAndrew So where can I watch that car crash again just to check?" she remarked.</p>

      <p>The Duke of York defended his reputation and made the decision to speak on the record about his friendship with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/inside-sordid-life-jeffrey-epstein-18888881">Epstein</a> , who was found hanged in a New York jail cell in August while awaiting a sex trafficking trial.</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, previously admitted prostituting a minor in 2008 and spent 13 months in prison after agreeing a plea bargain.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Andrew was dragged into the scandal when one of Epstein's victims alleged she had been forced to have sex with him when she was just 17 - which the prince categorically denies.</p>

      <p>Pilot and racehorse owner Carol wrote of Prince Andrew's comments about Epstein as the Saturday night interview aired.</p>
      <p>"So I didn't speak to him for 4 years because it wasn't appropriate, but when he was released from prison for sex offences I didn't ring him..no... I flew to America to tell him in person that I STILL wasn't going to talk to him...RUN THAT BY ME AGAIN."</p>

      <p>She continued while also responding to other people watching the interview: "Then after he was released for sex offences, &amp; even tho I hadn't spoken to him for 4 yrs, I wanted to 'show leadership' so I went for a walk with him in Central Park to tell him I STILL couldn't speak to him but somehow had a 4 night sleepover in his house....?!?!?! #PrinceAndrew."</p>
      <p>Seeming baffled at what she as watching, Carol added alongside questioning face emojis: "I stayed at his home on a 4 night sleepover to tell him that I didn't want to be his friend anymore. even tho I hadn't spoken to him for 4 years as he'd been in jail for sex offences BUT I only saw him for a walk..Oh and a dinner party..Oh and in the passage #PrinceAndrew."</p>

      <p>During the programme Prince Andrew denied dancing with Virginia at upmarket nightclub Tramp <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-didnt-sex-accuser-20897916">because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking</a> at the time, as well as several other baffling claims.</p>
      <p>One PR guru branded the TV stint "disastrous" and "like watching a man in quicksand" as millions tuned in to watch host Emily Maitlis grill the royal.</p>
      <p>PR and crisis consultant Mark Borkowski said it was a lesson on "how not to do" public relations.</p>
      <p>"I have never seen anything so disastrous. For any students of PR, that is how not to do it," he said.</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-evasive-heavily-coached-20896677">body language expert</a> also said Prince Andrew was being 'evasive and potentially deceptive' during the sit down.</p>
      <p>Experienced body language expert and psychologist Darren Stanton watched Andrew with a laser-like scrutiny as the 59-year-old broke his silence on the topic of the allegations and Epstein.</p>
      <p>"The behaviour I observed during the documentary is consistent with someone being evasive and potentially deceptive," Mr Stanton told MirrorOnline.</p>
      <p>"I am not convinced the account was consistent or congruent with the true emotion of the Prince."</p>
