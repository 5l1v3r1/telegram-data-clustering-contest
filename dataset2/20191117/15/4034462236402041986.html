      <p>When you get to be the CEO of a major corporation, your personal safety starts to become a legitimate concern. And with that CEO level paycheck, chances are you can afford a pretty luxurious vehicle. That is why Canadian armored vehicle specialist Inkas builds<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-bentley-bentayga-will-catch-a-grenade-for-you"> heavily armored versions of luxury vehicles</a> like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/g-class">Mercedes G-Class</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bentley/bentayga">Bentley Bentayga</a>. Inkas will even create an armored vehicle using the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/the-rugged-and-powerful-mercedes-amg-g63-is-now-literally-bulletproof">faster G63 AMG model</a>.</p>
      <p>These armored vehicles can stand up to pretty heavy assault including CEN 1063 BR6 ballistics and grenades. But if this still isn't enough protection and you prefer a vehicle with a "SWAT" experience, Inkas has just released the new 2020 Sentry Civilian, an armored law enforcement vehicle built for civilian use.</p>

      <p>"At Inkas, we love to innovate, we love to create something that fills a niche, that satisfies a need - whether it's a civilian vehicle or a full-scale armored personnel carrier," said Inkas CEO David Khazanski. "We are confident that the updated design and new interior features will not disappoint the civilian market."</p>
      <p>Inkas bases the Sentry Civilian on a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/f-450-super-duty">Ford F-550</a> platform, meaning the truck can handle heavy-duty use and extreme off-road conditions. To further improve performance, Inkas has optimized the suspension system, installed heavy-duty brakes, and reinforced key mechanical components across the vehicle. The Sentry Cilivian should stand up to the toughest conditions imaginable but it has also been designed for daily usage.</p>
