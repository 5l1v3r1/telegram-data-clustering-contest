      <p>Leeds United are being linked with a move for Birmingham City goalkeeper David Stockdale.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has made only one appearance for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">the Blues</a> this season, in August's 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat to Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>With Lee Camp the current first-choice keeper at St Andrew's, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/david-stockdale">Stockdale</a> has been kept on the bench in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Now the Sunday People are reporting that promotion-chasing Leeds are keen on a January move for the ex-Brighton &amp; Hove Albion man.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/leeds-united-transfers-live-goalkeeper-17267069">The report adds:</a> "Bailey Peacock-Farrell left Elland Road for Burnley in the summer for £3.5million and with several talented youngsters at the club, boss Marcelo Bielsa didn’t recruit a replacement.</p>
      <p>"However, he is now considering a move for Stockdale in the new year and the keeper would welcome the change."</p>
      <p>Stockdale joined Birmingham in the summer of 2017 under Harry Redknapp, having helped Brighton reach the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He has made 40 appearances for the Blues, as well as taking in loan spells at Southend United, Wycombe Wanderers and Coventry City.</p>
