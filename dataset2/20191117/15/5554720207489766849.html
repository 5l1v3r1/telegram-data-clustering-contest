      <p>Arhaan is a close friend of TV actress Rashami Desai, who recently said that she wouldn’t mind spending her life with him. Arhaan and Himanshi Khurana had received the least number of votes. In the end, Himanshi beat him to stay in the competition.</p>
      <p>Arhaan’s eviction left Rashami in tears as she cried bitterly seeing him leave the show.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, actress Amrita Dhanoa has reportedly alleged that the <i>Badho Bahu</i> actor was faking his identity and claimed that his real name was Mazhar Shaikh. She also alleged to have been in a live-in relationship with Arhaan for five years.</p>
