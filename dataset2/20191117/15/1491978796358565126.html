      <p>4 / 5 stars 4 out of 5 stars. <i><b>Barbican, London</b><br/>The Grammy-winning American singer puts on a typically nonchalant performance full of revelations</i></p>
      <p>Flawless nonchalance at a treacherously difficult art comes as axiomatic for American vocalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/cecile-mclorin-salvant-dreams-and-daggers-review-awe-inspiringly-audacious-jazz-reworking">C</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/cecile-mclorin-salvant-dreams-and-daggers-review-awe-inspiringly-audacious-jazz-reworking">écile McLorin Salvant</a> – the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wynton-marsalis">Wynton Marsalis</a>-hailed, Grammy-winning, unflashily charismatic jazz singer who often suggests she could turn the phone book into a spellbinding libretto. For all that, the announcer’s warm up to her Saturday gig at the EFG London jazz festival – “you’ll be taken on a journey you will never forget” – might have been queried by anyone comparing it with her tightrope-walking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/04/cecile-mclorin-salvant-review-jazz-informed-artistry-of-the-highest-class">Ronnie Scott’s</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/04/cecile-mclorin-salvant-review-jazz-informed-artistry-of-the-highest-class"> shows</a> of a few years back.</p>
      <p>But no Salvant performance is without its revelations – such as her exquisite account of the 1958 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/22/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries">Cy Coleman</a> classic You Fascinate Me So, or her jolting upward wail on the phrase “my heart will break, fired out of a melancholy dream-walk on Coleman’s With Every Breath I Take. Her forensic precision brought a gimlet stare to The Threepenny Opera’s The World Is Mean, Sting’s Until had its lyrics seamlessly compressed over her barnstorming stride-to-post-bop partner <a href="http://www.sullivanfortnermusic.com/">Sullivan Fortner</a>’s rolling piano rhythms, The Trolley Song leapt off an exhilaratingly fast-boogieing Fortner intro, and Oliver’s Where Is Love? And Pirate Jenny’s The Black Freighter were visited in the encores. It was an exposition of inconspicuously controlled, finely-honed artistry, even if saxophonist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/06/mccormack-and-yarde-duo-places-review">Jason Yarde’s and pianist Andrew McCormack</a>’s fusion of horn-hollering improv and spikier notions of melody had furnished some invaluable jazz balance in their supporting set.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, on the festival’s Friday launch night, the Kings Place <a href="https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/venus-unwrapped/">Venus Unwrapped</a> series hosted Lara Jones and Megan Roe’s spirited mix of punky guitar/sax ferocity and electronica as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jfriscomusic/">J Frisco</a>, bassist Alison Rayner’s intimate ARQ, a tentative-to-ecstatic reunion of all-female 1980s Latin-fusion sextet The Guest Stars – celebrating the innovative <a href="http://www.blowthefuse.com/">Blow t</a><a href="http://www.blowthefuse.com/">he Fuse</a> promoting organisation, and the late jazz-enabling dynamo <a href="https://serious.org.uk/news/2019/debbie-dickinson">Debbie Dickinson</a>. Later in the shoebox basement of Camden’s Con Cellar bar, devoted young originals including drummer <a href="https://www.samjesson.co.uk/">Sam Jesson</a>, saxophonists George Crowley (unveiling both his techno and post-bop leanings) and <a href="https://www.aliceleggett.co.uk/">Alice Leggett</a> simultaneously cherished where jazz has been, and relished where it might be headed.</p>
      <p>•The <a href="https://efglondonjazzfestival.org.uk/">EFG London jazz festival</a> continues until 24 November.</p>
