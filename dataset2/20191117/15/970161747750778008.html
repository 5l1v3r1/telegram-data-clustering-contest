        <b>Judd Trump takes a 5-3 lead into the second session of the Northern Ireland Open final against Ronnie O’Sullivan after a thrilling opening eight frames.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world champion was in impressive form in Belfast as he took an early 2-0 lead and has maintained a lead throughout the match so far.</p>
      <p>The Rocket was not at his best but was still good enough to make some crowd-pleasing breaks, including a 126 to win the third frame and then an 89 in the fifth.</p>
      <p>In between those two breaks, Trump made a superb 123 of his own and looked on for a maximum in the seventh as he got to 88 with 11 reds and blacks before getting a dreadful kick on the 12th red.</p>
      <p>That break took his lead to 5-2 and the pressure was on O’Sullivan to win the final frame of the session and stay in the match, which he did over two visits to the table and set up a tense evening session.</p>

      <p>Former world number three Neal Foulds thinks Trump will be delighted with how the game has gone over the afternoon.</p>
      <p>‘He started the match as favourite and he’s 5-3 up, so he’s further favourite with the bookies, he’s got to be pleased hasn’t he?’ Foulds said on Eurosport.</p>
      <p>‘He’s played 18 matches in the last three weeks, he won the World Open in Yushan and was brilliant, all the way through the Champion of Champions he looked the winner and lost in the final.</p>
      <p>‘Now he’s won all his matches here, why would he feel anything else but positive? He’s 5-3 up, Trump has got the world at his feet right now.</p>
      <p>‘Ronnie is in there, hanging on in there, is how I’d put it.</p>
      <p>‘Ronnie’s played exactly the way he’s played all week here, but he’s not playing guys who will let him win. I don’t mean let him win, I mean guys haven’t played at their best against him.</p>
      <p>‘Joe Perry didn’t play his best against him, neither did Shaun Murphy, they’re much better players than that, Judd is that step above all of the others and that’s why he’s world number one.’</p>
      <p>The second session starts at 7pm as the pair race to nine frames.</p>
