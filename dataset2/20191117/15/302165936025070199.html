      <p>PRAGUE, Nov 17 — Billionaire Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis expressed remorse over his communist past today at a ceremony in Prague celebrating 30 years since the Velvet Revolution toppled communism in then-Czechoslovakia.</p>
      <p>The populist mogul, who was a Czechoslovak Communist Party member in the 1980s, paid tribute to the 1989 peaceful uprising that ushered in democratic reform to the former Soviet satellite. </p>
      <p>His comments come after a quarter-million Czechs flooded central Prague on Saturday, in demonstrations to mark the anniversary that saw protesters demand Babis resign over allegations of graft and that he was once a communist secret agent. He has strongly denied the accusations.</p>
      <p>“As you surely know, I was a Communist Party member. I’m not proud of that,” Babis said at a ceremony attended by the prime ministers of Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and by German parliament speaker Wolfgang Schaeuble.</p>
      <p>He said he “wasn’t as brave” as Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright elected the president of Czechoslovakia in 1989, and thanked those behind the Velvet Revolution protests.</p>
      <p>“I’m standing here today as the prime minister elected in a free, democratic election, and therefore I want to, at least now, express my gratitude and humility,” said Babis, whose minority government now relies on the tacit support of Communist party lawmakers to survive in parliament.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Graft allegations</b>
      </p>
      <p>Babis took office after his ANO (YES) party won the 2017 general election, campaigning on an anti-corruption ticket in the EU and Nato country of 10.6 million.</p>
      <p>The fifth wealthiest Czech according to Forbes, Babis himself now faces a string of graft allegations and a conflict-of-interest probe by the European Commission centred on Agrofert, his sprawling farming, media and chemicals holding.</p>
      <p>He is also tagged as an agent in secret police files from the 1980s. He has strongly denied knowingly cooperating.</p>
      <p>ANO still tops opinion polls with around 30 percent support, but the scandals have stoked a public outcry against Babis. </p>
      <p>On Saturday the CTK Czech news agency quoted Interior Minister Jan Hamacek as saying some 250,000 people had rallied at Letna park—the site of some of the biggest 1989 rallies—matching a similar protests against Babis in June.</p>

        <b>Toppling Soviet rule</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thirty years ago the Velvet Revolution saw unprecedented demonstrations and a general strike end four decades of Soviet-imposed totalitarianism in the former Czechoslovakia, just weeks after the Berlin Wall crumbled.</p>
      <p>On November 17, 1989, Communist police brutally crushed a students’ march, sparking a student strike and the creation of an opposition movement which then negotiated the Communist Party’s departure from politics.</p>
      <p>In late December 1989, Havel, then the opposition leader, was elected president of Czechoslovakia, which went on to peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.</p>
      <p>The neighbours joined Nato and the EU, with Bratislava also joining the eurozone in 2009. — AFP</p>
