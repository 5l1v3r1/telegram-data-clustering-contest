        <b>A Dhaka court has ordered three people, including SMHI Faruk, to jail in a case that involves charges of forging the design of fire-ravaged FR Tower in Dhaka’s Banani.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge KM Imrul Kayes passed the order after rejecting their bail pleas on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The other suspects in the case are former RAJUK building inspectors Aurangzeb Siddique and Shawkat Ali.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Nov 5, the High Court scrapped bail for the three men and asked them surrender to the trial court within seven days, following an appeal from the Anti-Corruption Commission.</p>
      <p>On Mar 28, a deadly fire swept through FR Tower in Dhaka's Banani, leaving 27 people dead. Investigations into the incident later found irregularities relating to the building's construction.</p>
      <p>Engineer SMHI Faruk is the main owner of the land on which the high-rise office bloc was built by developer Rupayan Housing Estate Limited.</p>
      <p>On Jun 25, the ACC filed a case against 23 people, including BNP leader Tasvir Ul Islam, who is one of the other owners of FR Tower, for constructing the building with a forged design.</p>
