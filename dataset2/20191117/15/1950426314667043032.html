      <p>Ahead of the country’s national elections that were held on last Sunday, Vox presented a list of 100 proposals which included policies that would work to drastically reduce the number of illegal migrants living in Spain.</p>
      <p>Increased deportations of illegal migrants, more stringent border controls, and the construction of an “impassable wall” around the country’s North African exclaves were among Vox’s top priorities, online newspaper El Confidencial <a href="https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2019-11-10/programa-electoral-vox-10-noviembre-elecciones-generales-1_2304687/">reports</a>.</p>

      <p>In July, six Spanish border guards were injured in Melilla after <a href="https://voiceofeurope.com/2019/07/spain-200-illegal-migrants-rush-border-fence-injuring-six-border-guards/">200 illegal migrants</a>attempted to scale the security barrier which separates Europe from North Africa.</p>
