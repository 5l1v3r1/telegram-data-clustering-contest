      <p>The Redmi K20 series smartphones are an idol. Many smartphone makers take them as role models. However, there is no secret why these phones have become so popular not only among the customers but among other manufacturers as well. The company adds only a little margin (if nothing changed for Redmi, it’s 5%). Plus, Xiaomi likes bringing innovations to mainstream phones. So what do users see? – A great phone with many amazing features and a low price tag. Why not buy? The same strategy is assumed to be used on the upcoming models as well. However, <a href="https://m.ithome.com/html/457459.htm">today</a>, we learned some interesting news concerning the Redmi K30. It turns out this phone will use an LCD punch-hole screen and a side fingerprint design.</p>

      <p>It seems nothing strange with these features. But if looking at them more attentively we can see that particularly the screen part is identical to the Honor V30. Thus, there is every reason to think though Lei Jun has announced they are glad to have a rival like Huawei, the competition between these two is getting more and more fierce.</p>
      <p>The Redmi K30 will hit the market in <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/15/lu-weibing-redmi-k30-series-will-be-released-in-2020/">2020</a>. And there is no information when exactly it will come. As for its rival, the Honor V30 is set to come on November 30. We mean, if the Redmi K30 is going to compete with the V30, it will retard. Won’t this affect its sales performance?</p>
      <p>In terms of core configuration, the Redmi K30 will adopt a double-punch screen design. Under the hood, it should carry the Snapdragon 7 series 5G mobile platform, supporting NSA/SA dual-mode 5G.</p>
