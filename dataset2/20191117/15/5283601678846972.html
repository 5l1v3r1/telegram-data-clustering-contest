      <h1>Shiv Kapur’s errant drive on last hole hands Korean teen the Panasonic Open India title</h1>

      <p>Shiv Kapur faltered at the doorstep of victory as he hooked his drive on the closing Par-5 18th hole to hand the 17-year-old rookie, Joohyung Kim, the Panasonic Open India Trophy.</p>
      <p>It meant no one has still won the Panasonic Open more than once. It was also only the second time that a player other than an Indian had won the event in its nine editions.</p>
      <p>Joohyung finished at 13-under almost an hour before Kapur finished. Kapur came to the 18th tee at 14-under but fell to 12-under after his drive went out of bounds.</p>
      <p>It resulted in a double bogey as he failed to hole a difficult 25-footer for bogey that would have given him another chance in a play-off at the Classic Golf and Country Club.</p>
      <p>Kapur ended in a tie for second with S Chikkarangappa (67). Vikrant Chopra (67-70-69) was Tied-fifth, while Veer Ahlawat (69-69-70) was Tied-eighth.</p>
      <p>Arjun Prasad and M Dharma were Tied-11th. Chikka’s birdie on the 18th to get to 12-under helped him tie his best finish on Asian Tour at the AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open in 2018, where he tied-second.</p>
      <p>Kapur, one of the three co-leaders at the start, held the sole lead at two different stages.</p>
      <p>The first was soon after the very first hole when his two playing partners, Terry Pikadaris (71 and fourth) and Adam Blyth (77 and T-23) bogeyed. Kapur had a par. The second time was after his birdie on the 14th.</p>
      <p>Joohyung said, “It was really windy today and I scrambled quite well. It was not easy to shoot a 65 under these conditions. But I managed to do it and now, I’m a winner!”</p>
      <p>Joohyung, starting five groups ahead of Kapur, fired away at the flags and holed the birdies with remarkable consistency for six-under 30 front nine.</p>
      <p>He added a seventh on 10th.</p>
      <p>Despite no more birdies, he ended with the clubhouse lead at 13-under and waited for the next hour and more before a wayward drive from Kapur on the final hole opened the door. The consequent double bogey wrenched the Trophy away from Kapur’s grasp and Joohyung won his first Asian Tour title.</p>
      <h3>Rendered speechless</h3>
      <p>As a devasted Kapur left the course immediately after submitting his card, Joohyung, the toast of the evening, admitted he was speechless.</p>
      <p>The Korean teen, born in 2002, the year Kapur won the Asian Games gold in Korea, said, “I am really speechless. It has been a dream of mine to play on the Asian Tour ever since I was young. And it’s really wonderful to come here, be in contention and win. I cannot describe the feeling now. I’m still trying to learn every single step of the way.”</p>
      <p>Joohyung’s father, Chang Ik, is a former Korean pro, who after one season on the Buy.com (now called Korn Ferry Tour) in the US turned to golf teaching.</p>
      <p>Chang took Joohyung with him to Australia where he was doing his teaching course in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>The family then moved to the Philippines before making Thailand their home.</p>
      <h3>A great season</h3>
      <p>Joohyung added, “The season has been great especially coming back from my injuries and winning three times on the ADT and now this victory. Last week, I was one off the lead with two holes to play. But I ended sixth.”</p>
      <p>Vikrant Chopra (67-70-69) took a share of fifth place on 10-under 206 alongside Indonesia Rory Hie, who won the Classic International here six-od weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Jyoti Randhawa was two-under 214 for a share of the 44th place while fellow Tour senior Jeev Milkha Singh was a further shot back on 215 and tied 50th place.</p>
      <p>Chikka said, “I’ve been superb on the par-5s this week as my strategy to lay up within my favourite yardage with my approach shots worked wonders. I was 10-under on the par-5s through the tournament. My hitting and putting were very consistent but my wedge-play was my only weak link this week.”</p>
