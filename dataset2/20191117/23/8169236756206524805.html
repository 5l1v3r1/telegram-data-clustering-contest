      <h1>Striker with 88 career goals contacts Real Madrid to seal potential transfer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:06:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to Spanish outlet <a href="https://www.donbalon.com/futbol/laliga/llama-florentino-perez-quiere-ir-real-madrid-es-viejo-objetivo">Don Balon</a>, AC Milan striker Krzysztof Piatek has shockingly made contact with Real Madrid in order to seal a move to the La Liga giants.</p>
      <p>Don Balon claim that the Polish star deeply regrets joining Milan this January when he had the chance to move to Los Blancos in a €10m deal which also would’ve seen Genoa acquire Mariano Diaz.</p>
      <p>The Serie A star ultimately decided to join Milan as they offered him the chance to lead the line, whereas Madrid could only give him the chance to act as Karim Benzema’s understudy.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old is now willing to make sacrifices – including taking a lower wage and being willing to play second fiddle to Benzema, in order to seal a move to the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Piatek is aware that Madrid’s marquee summer signing Luka Jovic isn’t exactly Zinedine Zidane’s cup of tea and it’s even reported that he could head to Milan in a potential deal.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://sempremilan.com/gds-piatek-could-leave-milan-on-loan-genoa-ready-in-january">Sempre Milan</a> via La Gazzetta dello Sport, Milan are considering the option of loaning Piatek out in the January transfer window in a bid to help him get his confidence back.</p>
      <p>The Pole hasn’t score in almost a month for Milan, with his last strike coming against relegation candidates Lecce.</p>
      <p>Piatek has 88 career goals to his name for club and country but things haven’t gone to plan since his move to the San Siro.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see if Madrid consider a move for a player that’s currently out of form – regardless of the fact that he’s one of their former targets.</p>
