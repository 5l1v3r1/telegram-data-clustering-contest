      <p>An NYPD sergeant says the department punished him for seeking treatment for his 9/11-related illness by transferring him to a punitive post and withholding overtime, according to a lawsuit made public Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sgt. Cyress Smith, 52, developed a chronic cough, asthma and sleep apnea from sifting through debris at the Fresh Kills Landfill following the World Trade Center terrorist attacks, according to his Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Smith, who worked in the Performance Monitoring Unit, was placed on restricted duty in February 2015 because of his ailments, the suit says.</p>
      <p>He remained there for nearly two years, and says that he always got supervisors’ permission to attend medical appointments, according to court papers.</p>
      <p>But his commanding officer there still had him transferred to the department’s VIPER Unit at the end of 2016, the lawsuit says.</p>
      <p>The unit <a href="https://nypost.com/2011/03/20/outcast-cops-still-rake-it-in/">is a holding area for disciplinary cases</a>, who are stripped of their weapons and ordered to watch endless loops of surveillance footage from housing projects.</p>
      <p>“The NYPD needs to change its culture, they need to start treating their employees with respect,” Smith told The Post.</p>
      <p>Smith is suing for $1 million for lost compensation including $50,000 in annual overtime and emotional damages including “shame and humiliation,” legal papers say.</p>
      <p>And he says he’s not alone.</p>
      <p>One of Smith’s colleagues, a former terrorism intelligence lieutenant named Tom Lent, 45, says he doesn’t sleep at night because the “stigma of being in this unit is terrible.”</p>
      <p>Lent’s ex-wife accused him of kicking her during a February 2018 argument. The court dismissed the charges — but the NYPD is still investigating him. He is also planning to sue the department over his exile to the VIPER Unit.</p>
      <p>“As will be demonstrated in their lawsuits — in Smith’s recently filed, and Lent’s to be filed shortly — my clients have in common that they are hero cops cast aside, marginalized, and exiled to a police unit responsible for viewing New York City Housing surveillance tapes,” said their attorney Marshall Bellovin.</p>
      <p>An NYPD rep referred questions to the Law Department.</p>
      <p>“The first responders who took part in the 9/11 recovery efforts represent the best of New York, and the City is committed to protecting them and their legacy. That commitment includes supporting and accommodating officers,” agency spokesman Nick Paolucci said.</p>
      <p>“Discrimination of any type towards members of service is not tolerated however the Law Department cannot assess the merit of these particular claims before we’ve had a chance to fully review the lawsuit and investigate these allegations.”</p>
