      <h1>Former Alabama Star Writes Heartfelt Message To Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:18:34+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Tons of Alabama fans and haters alike have come out in support of ailing quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, whose very career may be in danger after a serious hip injury he suffered against Mississippi State yesterday.</p>
      <p>Among the many people to offer well-wishes to Tagovailoa is an Alabama legend: Former NFL MVP Shaun Alexander.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter today, Alexander expressed full confidence that Tagovailoa would recover. He expressed his love and respect for the young quarterback, and declared “A legend is being made.”</p>
      <p>Alexander’s post also included a picture of the two of them from a College Football Playoff press conference.</p>

      <p>Alexander is no stranger to injuries himself. After setting the NFL single-season rushing touchdown record in 2005, he never played a full season again.</p>
      <p>A broken foot in 2006, a fractured wrist in 2007, and an ineffective season in 2008 caused him to retire after nine years in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Prior to the injury, Tagovailoa was projected to be a first-round pick, and maybe even the No. 1 overall pick in 2020.</p>
      <p>But after an injury as severe as this one, who knows what Tagovailoa’s NFL future holds?</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it looks like the Alabama star will have plenty of support as he tries to make a full recovery.</p>
