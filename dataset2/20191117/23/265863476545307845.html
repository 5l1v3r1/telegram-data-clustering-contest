      <h1>Barbra Streisand’s And Ariana Grande’s Friendship Will Warm Your Heart</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:42:30+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:42</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Ariana Grande isn’t feeling well and the mystery illness resulted in her canceling her show in Lexington, Kentucky. Ariana knew she was unwell on Saturday, but taking to her Instagram on Sunday morning, she revealed in a story that she felt ten-times worse and wasn’t even sure what had happened to her. Ariana became emotional as she explained the situation and Barbra Streisand responded to her post on her own Instagram account.</p>
      <p>Barbra Streisand surprised millions when Ariana Grande walked out on stage with her and <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/ariana-grande-and-barbra-streisand-perform-duet-to-no-more-tears-watch-the-amazing-video-309289/">sang a duet</a> with her. The duo sang “No More Tears” and the video not only went viral, but it was the beginning of a sweet friendship between Ariana Grande and her idol Barbra Streisand.</p>
      <p>Barbra shared the following message to Ariana on her personal Instagram account where Barbra has 1 million followers.</p>
      <blockquote>“Feel better soon @ArianaGrande. Take a strong Vitamin C drink with some Manuka honey and of course get some chicken soup! Bx”</blockquote>
      <p>Barbra included a sweet photo of herself with Ariana Grande.</p>

      <p>A teary-eyed Ariana Grande stated the following in her sad Instagram story update.</p>
      <blockquote>“Okay, so I woke up kind of ten times worse and it hurts so bad to swallow. I’m not really sure what’s going on, but I, unfortunately, don’t think I will be able to push through tonight and I’m SO upset and sorry. Ugh. I’m so upset, but of course, obviously, you’ll be refunded and etc. I’m just really devastated.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ariana Grande’s disappointed fans immediately went into action and began gathering the masses to trend “Get well, Ariana” on various social media platforms.</p>
      <p>Ariana said she would continue to use her social media platforms to update her fans but her fans are encouraging her to stay off social media until she is well-rested and back to her old self. Usually, the best way to recover from sickness is to sleep so the body will heal.</p>
      <p>Ariana also showed that she was using a breathing treatment as she was having difficulty not only swallowing but breathing as well. Ariana explained she’s been having a difficult time breathing during her performances and she doesn’t understand why.</p>
      <p>She will be seeing a doctor to try and figure out what is going on with her health.</p>
