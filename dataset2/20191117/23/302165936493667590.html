      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 18 — Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg admitted he was wrong to support the “stop and frisk” police practice that ensnared disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos, apologizing to a largely African-American church yesterday as he weighs a presidential bid.</p>
      <p>“I was wrong. And I am sorry,” Bloomberg told the Christian Cultural Center, the <i>New York Times</i> reported, describing the center as a black megachurch.</p>
      <p>His reversal comes as he considers whether to compete for the Democratic nomination for president, a contest in which African-American voters are highly influential.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, has not formally entered the 2020 race, with the months-long nominating contests starting in February, but he has taken steps to get on the ballot in states with early filing deadlines.</p>
      <p>The self-made billionaire who served 12 years as New York mayor had long defended stop and frisk as an effective police tactic that saved lives, even after a federal judge in 2013 found it violated the rights of ethnic minorities.</p>
      <p>The practice stopped and frisked more than 684,000 people at its peak in 2011, ostensibly in many cases to search for illegal weapons. But the non-profit Center for Constitutional Rights conducted a study that found blacks and Latinos were nine times more likely than white people to be stopped in 2009. The searches sometimes turned up low-level offenses such as drug possession that otherwise would have gone unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg told the congregation the policy eroded trust with the public and he aimed to earn back that trust, the <i>Times</i> reported.</p>
      <p>“Over time, I've come to understand something that I long struggled to admit to myself: I got something important wrong. I got something important really wrong. I didn't understand back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives, but as we know, good intentions aren't good enough,” Bloomberg said.</p>
      <p>If Bloomberg does enter the race, he will be the fifth most-popular candidate, and his presence may draw more support away from former Vice President Joe Biden than others, a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll found.</p>
      <p>The November 12-14 national poll found that 3 per cent of Democrats and independents said they would vote for Bloomberg. — Reuters</p>
