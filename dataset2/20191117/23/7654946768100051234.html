      <p>Steve Karsay, who grew up a few miles from Shea Stadium and pitched for the Yankees, is to interview for the Mets pitching coach job, The Post has learned.</p>
      <p>Karsay served as the Brewers’ bullpen coach last season. Prior to that, he had worked in the Indians’ organization from 2012-18.</p>
      <p>Karsay was a Blue Jay first-round pick in 1990 out of Christ the King High School. He played for five organizations, including the A’s twice. He gave up one of the most famous homers in Met history while a Brave in 2001. On Sept. 21 of that year — in the first major sports event in New York after the 9/11 attacks — Karsay surrendered a mammoth, eighth-inning, two-run homer to MIke Piazza.</p>
      <p>After that season, Karsay signed a four-year contract with the Yankees, pitching well in 2002 before shoulder surgery cost him all of the 2003 season and most of 2004.</p>
