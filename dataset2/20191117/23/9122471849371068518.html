      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:02:31+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles are going to have to beat the New England Patriots without the services of Lane Johnson, one of their top offensive linemen.</p>
      <p>Johnson suffered a head injury in the first half of this afternoon’s game. He was carted off the field before walking into the locker room on his own.</p>
      <p>Johnson is being evaluated for a concussion, and the Eagles already announced he won’t return to the game.</p>
      <p>Halapoulivaati Vaitai has stepped in and replaced Johnson at right tackle.</p>

      <p>At halftime, the Eagles lead New England 10-9. Carson Wentz hit tight end Dallas Goedert for the only touchdown during the first 30 minutes of game action, while the Patriots are staying close thanks to Nick Folk’s three field goals.</p>
      <p>The second half of Patriots-Eagles is coming up shortly on CBS.</p>
      <p>Philly needs a win to keep pace with the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East.</p>
