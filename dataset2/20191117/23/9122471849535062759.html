      <h1>Tom Brady’s Halftime Stats vs. Eagles Are Pretty Brutal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:07:04+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tom Brady and the New England Patriots’ passing attack has seen better days. The Philadelphia Eagles have prevented the AFC East leaders from establishing any kind of consistency through the air this evening.</p>
      <p>New England is trailing Philadelphia, 10-9, after two quarters of play. All things considered, the Patriots are lucky the score is that close.</p>
      <p>Brady and the Patriots’ passing attack has been poor at best through one half.</p>
      <p>New England’s star quarterback actually set a career record for incompletions in the first half.</p>

      <p>Brady hasn’t been at his best through the air for much of the 2019 regular season. He currently ranks 11th in the league in QBR and his 64.8 completion percentage is his lowest since the 2015 season.</p>
      <p>Of course, the Patriots are still 8-1 and leading the AFC, so they seem to be handling things just fine when it comes to the passing game.</p>
      <p>However, Brady and Co. will likely need to make some improvements down the stretch if they want to make a serious run at the Super Bowl. They can start with an improved performance in the second half in Philadelphia.</p>
