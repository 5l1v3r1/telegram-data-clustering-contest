      <h1>Dwight Howard Is Back On Top Form After Being Mocked For Apparent Inappropriate Gesture In This Video Following The Masin Elije Scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:15:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mel Walker</a></address>
      <p>Dwight Howard has been dealing with some odd stuff lately, the trouble started with a thread on Twitter by Masin Elije, and the rumors about him just have not stopped.</p>
      <p>Some of them have gotten quite serious, too, and it looks like the NBA star will not be able to escape his “fame” anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Entirely, on the contrary, things seem to be ramping up lately, with people on Twitter and other social media platforms always ready to jump on him for anything he says or does.</p>
      <p>Just recently, Howard came under fire for a gesture that some perceived as inappropriate — all because Howard fell on George Niang, facing him backward.</p>
      <p>A video from the NBA game seems to show Howard pushing his finger inside Niang’s behind, and immediately became viral and was shared by thousands of people in a short time.</p>
      <p>And while many have pointed out that the incident is taken out of context, most of the people sharing the video do not seem to care, as it provides a pretty good entertainment value for them.</p>

      <p>Howard has not responded to the situation at all, though some have pointed out that it is probably wise of him to just stay quiet at the moment.</p>
      <p>In the end, though, there is no indication insight that the situation around Howard is going to calm down anytime soon.</p>
      <p>He might have a lot more to deal with shortly, judging by the way people have been attacking him on this incident and the general attitude of his followers.</p>
      <p>The three-time Defensive Player of the Year is trying to focus on his purpose for the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
      <p>He said in a new interview: “I think it’s my purpose to go out every single night and play hard defense, trying to block every shot, trying to be in the paint, get a lot of steals, go for loose balls. Whatever I can do for this team, be of service, that’s my mission. I don’t see it as my role; I see it as a purpose.”</p>
      <p>The good news for the NBA star is that his basketball skills are slowly coming back to the surface and pushing the different rumors about his sexuality and personal life.</p>
      <p>This season has been performing really well.</p>
