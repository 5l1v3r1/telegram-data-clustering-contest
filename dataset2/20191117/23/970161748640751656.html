      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> earned major dad points after admitting to having injured himself sterilising his one-year-old daughter’s bottles ahead of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here</a> premiere.</p>
      <p>With the presenter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-and-dec/">teaming up</a> with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> to present the Australian competition show again, viewers were overjoyed to see the pair back on their screens together.</p>
      <p>But after one fan spotted a nasty looking graze on Dec’s arm, the 44-year-old had to confirm that he hadn’t sustained his injury by crawling with insects, swimming with fish or taking part in Celebrity Cyclone like the I’m A Celeb contestants are about to.</p>
      <p>No, Dec’s was far less, erm, glamorous.</p>
      <p>‘Dec- what have you done to your arm? Looks like a nasty injury,’ the Twitter user asked, with Dec quickly clarifying that he was OK.</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘I scalded myself while sterilising Isla’s dummies,’ adding a couple of face palm and crying laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>Ah, the life of a parent to a one-year-old…</p>
      <p>After a year presenting without his best pal, Sunday night’s launch show for I’m A Celebrity 2019 saw <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-mcpartlin-way-keen-reunite-best-mate-declan-donnelly-im-celebrity-troubled-year-11169522/">the dynamic duo return to the jungle together</a> with the audience thrilled to have the boys back with their trademark hilarious jokes.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-ant-dec-make-digs-caitlyn-jenners-rumoured-500k-fee-11172629/">Caitlyn Jenner’s rumoured ‘£500k fee’</a> to compete on the show and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-dec-open-im-celebrity-hilarious-prince-andrew-sweat-dig-11172692/">Prince Andrew’s sweating</a> were joked about in the first few minutes – talk about hitting the ground running.</p>
      <p>Speaking about returning to the show after his addiction issues and drink driving arrest, Ant said: ‘I’m very, very excited about getting back on the show.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a brilliant place to work and a brilliant part of the world to be in. Plus, I’m back with my best friend. I can’t wait.’</p>
