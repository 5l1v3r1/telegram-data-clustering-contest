        <i>The group caught up in the ‘incredibly dangerous’ crossing said they were Iranian</i>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 39 people have been detained after four small boats were intercepted attempting to cross the English Channel. The boats were discovered near Dover early on Sunday morning, with officials first being alerted to a vessel carrying nine people at 4.30am.</p>
      <p>Border Force officials made a second interception at 6am, when a vessel carrying five people was found. Between 7am and 7.30am a further two boats were intercepted, with 11 people on the first and 14 on the second.</p>
      <p>All 39 presented themselves as Iranian nationals, a government spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: “Border Force dealt with four incidents on November 17 after being alerted to small boats travelling across the Channel towards the UK. The people from all boats were taken to Dover, where they were medically assessed before being interviewed by immigration officials.</p>
      <p>“Crossing the Channel in a small boat is incredibly dangerous. Anyone attempting the journey is taking a huge risk with their life and the lives of their loved ones.”</p>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/11/record-number-of-migrants-cross-channel-to-uk-in-single-day">a record 86 migrants crossed the English Channel</a> in a single day.</p>
