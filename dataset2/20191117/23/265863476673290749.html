      <h1>Lizzo Lawsuit: Postmates Driver That Lizzo Blasted Is Suing Her!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:34:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Lizzo is about to find out just how famous she is. The woman that the R&amp;B star blasted for stealing her food is suing her!</p>
      <p>If you haven’t heard about this interesting story, it involves a Postmates driver who Lizzo accused of stealing her food after a series of miscommunications at the hotel she was staying at. Lizzo claimed that the woman stole her food while the driver claimed that she went to the singer’s location and left after five minutes of not being able to deliver it to her.</p>
      <p>Months ago the talented musician tweeted out a photo of the woman that revealed not only her face but also her name.</p>
      <p>‘Hey @Postmates this girl Tiffany W. stole my food she lucky I don’t fight no more.’</p>
      <p>Lizzo then realized that she made a huge mistake by plastering Tiffany’s on Twitter for her nearly one million followers to see.</p>
      <p>She followed it up with: ‘I apologize for putting that girl on blast. I understand I have a large following and that there were so many variables that could’ve put her in danger. Imma really be more responsible with my use of social media and check my petty and my pride at the door.’</p>

      <p>Wendy Williams later revealed that since the incident, Tiffany has been feeling anxiety and shame since being exposed by Lizzo.</p>
      <p>It turns out that she is now going to take legal actions for the damages caused. She claims she was forced to quit her job as a food delivery driver and is suing for libel, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light invasion of privacy.</p>
      <p>The complaint reads: ‘As a direct result of Lizzo’s actions, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer substantial damage and loss, including, but not limited to, the loss [of] future earnings, pain and suffering, emotional distress and trauma, fear of physical safety, insult, anguish, stress and anxiety, public ridicule, humiliation, indignity, damage and injury to her personal and professional reputation, and other incidental and consequential damages and expenses.’</p>
      <p>Do you think Tiffany has a point here?</p>
