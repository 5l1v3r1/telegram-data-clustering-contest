      <p>The best-performing nations from the UEFA Nations League who do not qualify automatically for Euro 2020 will get a playoff place, and the paths are now starting to take shape.</p>
      <p>There will be 16 teams in the playoffs, with four in each from a UEFA Nations League path.</p>
      <p>The winners of the two one-legged semifinals (March 26) will meet in the final (March 31) for a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>The highest-ranked nation will be at home in the semifinal. While on Nov. 22 (11 a.m. UK, 6 a.m. ET), UEFA will draw the home team for the final ties.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/uefa-european-championship-qualifying/story/3805034/euro-2020-qualifying-all-you-need-to-know">playoff system is explained in greater detail here</a>.</p>
      <p>- <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/uefa-european-championship-qualifying/story/3992203/euro-2020-playoffs-draw-how-it-works"><b>Euro 2020 playoffs draw: How it works</b></a></p>
      <p>The UEFA Nations League rankings are in the following order, for teams who have not qualified automatically.</p>
      <p>*Guaranteed to take part in playoffs; <b>teams in bold</b> are currently in a playoff position; <i>teams in italics</i> cannot reach the playoffs</p>
      <p><b>League A:</b> Switzerland, <b>Iceland*</b></p>
      <p><b>League B:</b> <b>Bosnia and Herzegovina*</b>, Denmark, <b>Wales</b>, <b>Slovakia</b>, <b>Republic of Ireland</b>, <b>Northern Ireland*</b></p>
      <p><b>League C:</b> <b>Scotland*</b>, <b>Norway*</b>, <b>Serbia*</b>, <b>Bulgaria*</b>, <b>Israel*</b>, Hungary, <b>Romania*</b>, <i>Greece</i>, <i>Albania, Montenegro, Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Lithuania</i></p>
      <p><b>League D:</b> <b>Georgia*</b>, <b>Macedonia*</b>, <b>Kosovo*</b>, <b>Belarus*</b>, <i>Luxembourg, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Gibraltar, Faroe Islands, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Malta, San Marino</i></p>
      <p>It means the playoffs, at present, would look like this:</p>
      <p><b>Teams in bold</b> are locked in, guaranteed a playoff. League D is now confirmed.</p>
      <p><u>League A</u><br/><b>Iceland</b> vs. Bulgaria/Israel/Romania<br/>Wales/Slovakia/Northern Ireland vs. Bulgaria/Israel/Romania</p>
      <p><u>League B</u><br/><b>Bosnia and Herzegovina</b> vs. Republic/Northern Ireland<br/>Wales vs. Slovakia/Republic of Ireland<br/>OR<br/>Slovakia vs. Republic of Ireland</p>
      <p><u>League C</u><br/><b>Scotland</b> vs. Bulgaria/Israel<br/><b>Norway </b>vs. <b>Serbia</b></p>
      <p><u>League D</u><br/><b>Georgia </b>vs. <b>Belarus</b><br/><b>North Macedonia</b> vs. <b>Kosovo</b></p>
      <p>The only way this scenario can now happen is if both Wales and Slovakia fail to qualify automatically. The teams involved may yet change through the final few days of qualifying.</p>
      <p>
        <anchor name="pots"/>
      </p>
      <p>There is a special condition in the playoff draw principles that states <u>all</u> hosts should be given the best chance to qualify. As such, it is expected that, wherever possible, there will only be one host in each playoff path.</p>
      <p>That means Romania would likely move from the League C path to League A because, as hosts, they require a playoff route to the finals that does not include another host and Scotland, as Nations League group winners, by rights should be in the League C path. Bulgaria and Israel would then draw for who takes the remaining slot in the League C path and who also moves to League A.</p>
      <p>There would be a draw to decide which of Slovakia, Wales and Northern Ireland move to League A. Republic of Ireland would be expected to remain in path B so it has a host, along with Nations League winners Bosnia.</p>
      <p>If the League B path has four teams, one semifinal would be Bosnia vs. Northern Ireland while the other would be between two of Denmark, Wales, Slovakia and Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <h3>FINALS DRAW</h3>
      <p>The draw will be held on Saturday, Nov. 30, in Bucharest, Romania. The draw ceremony will begin at midday ET (6 p.m. CET) and is expected to last 50 minutes in total (with 20 minutes for the draw itself).</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>As it stands</b><b>,</b> <b>based on teams in automatic qualifying positions</b><b>, the draw pots would be:</b></p>
      <p><b>Pot 1:</b> Italy, Belgium, England, Germany, Ukraine, Spain<br/><b>Pot 2:</b> France, Poland, Denmark, Croatia, Netherlands, Portugal<br/><b>Pot 3:</b> Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Austria, Sweden, Czech Republic<br/><b>Pot 4:</b> Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Bosnia, Scotland, Georgia</p>
      <p>
        <i>*Highest-ranked nations are used for the playoff winners in this illustration.</i>
      </p>
      <p>One team from each pot would be drawn into the six groups.</p>
