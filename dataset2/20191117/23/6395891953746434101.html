      <p><b>LOWELL, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Ian Sistare scored 15 points, Chris Knight had 14 and Dartmouth scored the last nine points in overtime to defeat UMass Lowell 80-75 on Sunday after blowing a 19-point lead in the last 10 minutes of regulation.</p>
      <p>Christian Lutete's 3-pointer with 1:36 to go in overtime gave the River Hawks their biggest lead, 75-71. Trevon Ary-Turner quickly answered with a 3 for the Big Green. In the final minute, Lowell missed the front end of a one-and-one and three 3-pointers. Aaryn Rai made two free with 40 seconds to go, another pair at 19 and Ary-Turner finished it off with two more with a second to play after two Lowell misses in the last 10 seconds.</p>
      <p>James Foye added 12 points and Rai 10 for the Big Green (4-1), which was 7 for 16 from the foul line heading into overtime, where they went 8 for 8.</p>
      <p>Ron Mitchell had 17 points, Josh Gantz 16 and Obadiah Noel 15 for Lowell (2-5), which lost all three games in its own River Hawk Invitational by a total of seven points. Dartmouth, along with Jacksonville and Merrimack, went 2-1 in the round robin.</p>
      <p>Sistare's 3-pointer with 10:30 to play put Dartmouth up 62-43. From there, Lowell went 8 of 9 with four 3-pointers and was 4 of 6 from the foul line. Dartmouth was 1 of 12 and 2 of 6 from the foul line, including two one-and-ones.</p>
      <p>Mitchell's 3 tied the game at 67 with 19 seconds to go and Knight's layup at the buzzer rolled off the rim.</p>
