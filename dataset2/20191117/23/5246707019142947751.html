      <p><b>Update - Mon 18th Nov 06:30:</b> Roku has now posted the following message on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/dx0lem/my_insignia_roku_tv_is_stuck_in_a_boot_loop/">Roku subreddit</a>, stating how it is working to resolve the issue (thanks, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/pokemon-sword-shield-roku-devices-crashing/">Digital Trends</a>).</p>
      <blockquote>We are aware of an issue when using Nintendo Switch and the latest Pokémon game impacting a limited number of Roku devices. We are working diligently to resolve this issue. In the meantime, turning off your Nintendo Switch or setting to airplane mode should resolve the issue.</blockquote>

      <p><b>Original Story - Sun 17th Nov, 2019 23:45:</b> If your Roku streaming device has been playing up since you've started <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></b>, you're not alone. According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/dxc5yg/psa_pokemon_swordshield_causes_roku_devices_on/">post on the Pokémon subreddit</a>, running the new Switch game and device on the same network supposedly results in Roku crashing and going into a never-ending boot cycle.</p>
      <p>The problem is <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/11/17/pokemon-sword-and-shield-fossil-pokemon/">reportedly</a> tied to Sword and Shield's Y-Comm service continually searching for other players on the same network or online, combined with Roku's inability to distinguish Pokémon data packets from the ones it needs to function properly. The device most affected by this is apparently the Roku Streaming Stick.</p>
      <p>There's also a theory the problem could be more directly linked to the Switch. Either way, it's believed to be "signals" from the Switch that are crashing the device. Fortunately, there are a few temporary fixes available. You can either move your Switch across to a different network to avoid interference or play the game offline in Airplane Mode.</p>
