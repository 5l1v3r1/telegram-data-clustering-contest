      <h3>Manchester United could complete a January move to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10361226/man-utd-gareth-bale-transfer-paul-pogba-real-madrid/">Sun</a> is reporting that the Wales international could sign for the Red Devils as early as the new year, and even if he doesn’t move in January, he looks likely to complete the transfer in the summer.</p>
      <p>According to the same report, Real Madrid are willing to let Bale leave the club next year following his lack of playing time in recent months.</p>
      <p>The story claims that sources close to Bale say that the attacking midfielder is ready to “call time” on his spell in Spain with the La Liga giants.</p>
      <p>The article says that Real Madrid are willing to do business, but the Spanish club would like to use Bale as leverage to bring Paul Pogba to the Bernabeu from Manchester United.</p>
      <p>If Manchester United do not want to do business in January, it may delay a deal for Bale until the summer transfer window, the story adds.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Bale has only made six La Liga appearances so far this season, scoring two goals and making two assists for Zinedine Zidane’s men.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Manchester United will return to Premier League action next weekend with a trip to Sheffield United.</p>
