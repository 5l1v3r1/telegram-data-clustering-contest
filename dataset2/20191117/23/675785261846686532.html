      <h2>Prince Andrew and the royal household are reeling from the fallout of his car-crash Newsnight interview, in which he failed to apologise for the Jeffrey Epstein scandal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:06:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author">Ingrid Seward, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ingrid-seward/</a></address>
      <p>Agreeing to this interview is quite different to anything the Duke of York has ever agreed to before.</p>
      <p>He has made mistakes in the past but never felt it necessary to justify them. Sadly, there seems to be nothing positive to come out of it.</p>
      <p>He persisted in doing it because he hoped it would help him to move on, but it’s only made matters worse.</p>
      <p>He is the Queen’s son and she will support him – although she cannot be happy about it.</p>
      <p>I was surprised he did not apologise at the end, when he was given every chance.</p>
      <p>He should have shown humility and reiterated how sorry he was. Unfortunately, he did not use that opportunity.</p>

      <p>I don’t see that this interview has gained anything and presume the reason the Duke agreed to do it was to try to clear his name.</p>
      <p>But it doesn’t seem to have done anything other than heap more criticism on him.</p>
      <p>This has been hanging over him for years and has just got more and more difficult.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace and the BBC began negotiating at the start of this year, and any doubts Andrew might have had about doing such an interview were well-founded.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, he should not have gone ahead. The Royal Family always move on – they have to.</p>
      <p>People’s memories are short, but no one will be forgetting this.</p>
