      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bella-hadid/">Bella Hadid</a> has seemingly shaded <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/victorias-secret/">Victoria’s Secret</a> after admitting that she never felt confident modelling underwear until she walked for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rihanna/">Rihanna</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/20/rihanna-slayed-us-black-lace-drops-new-savage-x-fenty-lingerie-collection-10776695/">Savage x Fenty</a> in 2019.</p>
      <p>Queen Ri will do that to you.</p>
      <p>Bella was singing the praises of Rihanna’s inclusive lingerie catwalk show at a recent fashion event.</p>
      <p>However fans interpreted her comments to be a sly dig at her time as a VS Angel, having walked for the company in three shows since 2016.</p>
      <p>‘Rihanna‘s amazing,’ Bella told crowds at the Vogue Fashion Festival according to <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/bella-hadid-never-felt-powerful-in-victorias-secret-shows-1203371806/">WWD</a>.</p>
      <p>‘For me, that was the first time on a runway that I felt really sexy. Because when I first did Fenty, I was doing other lingerie shows and I never felt powerful on a runway, like, in my underwear.’</p>
      <p>It’s hard to imagine the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/bella-hadid-declared-worlds-beautiful-woman-case-wanted-stan-harder-10923847/">world’s most beautiful woman</a> not seeing herself as the rest of the world sees her, but Bella admitted that Rih had given her the confidence to walk any way she wanted during the show.</p>

      <p>‘I like being another character. I think at this point I don’t necessarily love being myself sometimes,’ the model explained.</p>

      <p>‘Sometimes on the runway you get either nervous or you forget how your legs move.’</p>

      <p>We’ve all been there girl. Sure, ours wasn’t in front of millions of viewers and surrounded by supermodels, but we definitely feel you.</p>
      <p>With so much experience behind her, it’s easy to forget that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/30/model-sisters-gigi-and-bella-hadid-are-style-icons-even-off-the-runway-at-paris-fashion-week-10833480/">younger Hadid sister</a> is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/inside-bella-hadids-23rd-birthday-party-celebrates-pizza-cake-mug-painting-10901943/">only 23 years old</a>, with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/birthday-girl-bella-hadid-slays-celebrates-stylish-sister-gigi-nyc-10900039/">model celebrating her big day</a> in October with a simple yet sweet day of fun.</p>
      <p>Along with her mum Yolanda, sister <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gigi-hadid/">Gigi</a>, brother Anwar and a host of fellow models, Bella spent the day painting pottery and eating a cake decorated like a pizza.</p>
