      <h1>A guide to visiting Antarctica: This ice cool destination is an experience like no other</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:02:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author">David McGonigal</a></address>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Antarctica, a continent covered in pure ice and populated by penguins, is truly the planet's outstanding last frontier. Its isolated position and the fact that it's surrounded by savage oceans has historically protected it from all but the most intrepid visitors.</p>
      <p>But that remoteness is rapidly changing. The summer of 2000 was the first season in which Antarctica had more than 10,000 visitors. Indeed, when I first visited in 1995 (on an assignment for an early incarnation of this title) I was one of less than 100,000 people known to ever have seen this mystical land of ice and heroics.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Last summer - almost 25 years later - more than 56,000 people visited the continent, including some 10,000 on large cruise ships not capable of landing passengers. The great majority of visitors (98 per cent) travelled from South America to the Antarctic Peninsula. It's estimated that this coming summer will see almost 80,000 Antarctic visitors and the following summer's visitation may exceed 100,000.</p>
      <p>The nature of Antarctic tourism has evolved greatly, too. When Lars-Eric Lindblad, the late pioneering explorer and entrepreneur, took the first 57 tourists to Antarctica in 1966 it was on a basic Argentine navy vessel. The millennium boom was largely on-board Russian research vessels that were comfortable but not luxurious.</p>
      <p>Today there are more than 40 new expedition vessels either being built, on the drawing boards, or sailing to Antarctica for their first season that offer unprecedented levels of technology and luxury. Among those new builds coming to Antarctica is Seabourn Venture, which launches in 2021, and Viking has its first expedition vessels on the way. There's also a clear shift to new ships with excellent ice performance, Oceanwide Hondius and Antarctica XXI's MV Magellan Explorer reflecting that trend</p>
      <p>What does this all mean for prospective visitors? Well, the food on the ships is much better than the past when providers in Ushuaia, Argentina, the world's southernmost city and the nearest departure point to Antarctica, would deliver crates of soggy lettuces to the dock. Communal bathrooms have given way to marble ensuites and ships use cleaner fuel.</p>
      <p>In 2000, 21 ships and yachts landed about 14,000 passengers on Antarctica. This year it's expected that 63 vessels will land more than 59,000 visitors. Much of the Peninsula foreshore comprises sheer cliff faces and towering glaciers with limited landing spots.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there's a system in place to allocate who goes where. Antarctica is controlled by all the nations who have signed on to the Antarctic Treaty. When Antarctic tourism first took off in the early 1990s the operators formed the self-regulating International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO).</p>
      <p>Each ship comes to Antarctica with each excursion of season pre-booked. Once a ship has reserved a spot another can't book it. However, wind, waves and ice can force a change of plans on the day. Flexibility is lost when every site is booked. And "climate change is giving us more windy days with stronger winds," a veteran polar captain told me.</p>
      <p>Darrel Day, the owner and skipper of the yacht Spirit of Sydney, has taken passengers to Antarctica since 1999. "Yachts work outside the IAATO ship scheduler but it's impossible to miss the growth in ship traffic. Anchored at a popular site like Cuverville Island we may see three ships, one after the other, disembarking at that one landing beach."</p>
      <p>Several solutions have been suggested, from limiting ships to a single landing each day to allocating a points system to the most popular sites.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Will more tourism affect wildlife? Fortunately, the Antarctic Treaty administration issues detailed guidelines for most sites to minimise impact by stating where and when you can go and how many ships of what size can visit each day.</p>
      <p>There's an overriding rule that a maximum of 100 passengers are allowed ashore at one time, plus expedition staff. Ships carrying more than 200 passengers are restricted to certain sites and ships with more than 500 passengers are not permitted to make landings at all.</p>
      <p>At a time when polar ships are getting bigger, ships carrying fewer that 100 guests will become the new luxury as everyone will be allowed ashore at once, rather than waiting on staggered landing times.</p>

      <p>Every visit to Antarctica is special. Wild and untamed it is so remarkable that, in more than 100 voyages south, I've never met anyone who says they weren't changed by it. From your first iceberg to sailing glaciers-lined bay and being greeted ashore by penguins, it's an unmatched experience. To be in a small rubber boat when a whale surfaces a metre away is unforgettable.</p>
      <p>No doubt, those who have already been there will regard themselves as pioneers to dismiss the greater comfort and technological offerings of new generation vessels.</p>
      <p>The Antarctic is too expansive and the weather too fickle to ever be tamed. The rapidly growing number of visitors will have to be managed and, as yet, no one has said how that will be achieved. Now really is the time go and, to that end, we provide this detailed guide to how to make it a reality.</p>

      <h3>TEN TIPS FOR A SUCCESSFUL NEW ERA TRIP TO ANTARCTICA</h3>
      <h3>WHEN TO GO</h3>
      <p>Summer is the time to visit. Early season has pristine snow, penguins nesting and sea ice; mid-season has penguin chicks; late season has whales and moulting penguins.</p>
      <h4>CHOOSE THE RIGHT ITINERARY</h4>
      <p>There are three main routes from South America. The most affordable is the east side of the peninsula. Add extra days for a voyage that crosses the Antarctic Circle. The longest route is to Antarctica via the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island. Several voyages include the cost of internal or charter flights and some include a flight to Antarctica or the Falklands.</p>
      <h4>CHOOSE THE RIGHT SHIP</h4>
      <p>Though fewer in number now there are still some quite basic ships sailing to Antarctica while there are others offering butlers, helicopters and submarines. Visit <a href="https://iaato.org/home">iaato.org </a>to find links to the websites of member companies and see <a href="http://www.traveller.com.au/antarctica">traveller.com.au/antarctica</a></p>
      <h4>CHOOSE THE RIGHT EXCURSIONS</h4>
      <p>On Antarctic voyages excursions off the ship are included. Though you may need to select (and pay extra) if you wish to use a helicopter, dive, kayak or camp on the ice.</p>
      <h4>WHAT TO PACK</h4>
      <p>Everyone thinks Antarctica equals cold but for visitors the Peninsula equates to Australian ski resort cold. But travelling in small boats can be wet. Check if your chosen company supplies wet weather gear. Buy the best Goretex gloves you can find and pack a second pair for when they get wet. Take lots of camera memory.</p>
      <h4>HOW TO STAY HEALTHY</h4>
      <p>If you have a proven anti-seasickness remedy, pack it. Or take a range. The crossing south is the worst – it's smooth once you reach the ice and most have "sea legs" for the homeward voyage. Walk within your limitations, whether on a rocking ship or rocky shore. And everyone holds the hand rails so hand sanitise often.</p>
      <h3>DON'T LEAVE ANTARCTICA WITHOUT ...</h3>
      <h4>SEE</h4>
      <p>South Georgia has colonies of half a million king penguins, the rugged island is beautiful and Grytviken is the gravesite of legendary explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton.</p>
      <h4>DO</h4>
      <p>A Zodiac cruise can be as rewarding as landing. Icebergs are like sculpture gardens and you may see whales and seals up close.</p>
      <h4>SEE</h4>
      <p>Most Peninsula voyages come within 100 nautical miles of the Antarctic Circle (66 degrees 33.6 minutes) but only a few voyages cross it. The landscape is different and icier down there and Marguerite Bay is wonderful.</p>
      <h4>DO</h4>
      <p>Global warming reveals more crevasses but there are still glaciers safe to climb. The view makes it worthwhile though it's embarrassing to be passed by penguins on the uphill slog.</p>
      <h4>SEE</h4>
      <p>Penguins lead simple lives: feed, breed, nest, feed young, fight with neighbours, moult. Watch a colony to understand their lives. Stroppy chinstraps are the most entertaining but Adelies are funny and kings elegant while gentoos emulate Homer Simpson.</p>
      <h4>DO</h4>
      <p>The most common mistake first time visitors make is to rush around. Try to put the camera away at least once and just observe.</p>
      <h4>SEE</h4>
      <p>Until Christmas it never gets dark so you decide whether it's sunrise or sunset.</p>
      <h4>DO</h4>
      <p>At the start of summer, bays may be filled with winter ice. If given the opportunity to walk on it, take it – you'll feel like a true polar explorer.</p>
      <h4>SEE</h4>
