      <p>Meanwhile, Dec seemed to be sporting a red mark on his arm that also left fans intrigued.</p>
      <p>It looked remarkably like a burn!</p>

      <p>The series kicked off tonight with half of the celebs arriving on board a luxury yacht, while the other half were taken by speedboat to a beach.</p>
      <p>The teams were stunned when the gang on the yacht - Nadine Coyle, Ian Wright, James Haskell, Kate Garraway, and Myles Stephenson - were told they had to swim to the beach in the clothes they were wearing to partner up with someone else.</p>
      <p>Those waiting on the beach were Caitlyn, Roman Kemp, Adele Roberts, Jacqueline Jossa, and Andrew Maxwell.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Once the pairs had been decided, a terrifying challenge awaited six of them as they had to walk the plank high in the sky.</p>
      <p>Roman and Myles completed it the fastest and were declared a 'power pair' meaning they got to stay in the nicer camp.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/im-a-celebrity-spoilers-nadine-coyle-in-tears-over-10000ft-skydive-challenge/">Nadine Coyle and Caitlyn jumped out of a plane</a> to collect a key, Nadine and Adele ended up winning their challenge to become the second power pair.</p>
      <p>The others will be in a basic camp and on basic rations for the foreseeable future.</p>
