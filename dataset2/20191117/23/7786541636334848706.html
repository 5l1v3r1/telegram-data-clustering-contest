      <p><b>HOMESTEAD, Fla.Â (AP)</b> - The Latest on NASCAR's Cup Series championship (all times local):</p>
      <p>6:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>Kyle Busch has won his second NASCAR Cup Series championship, giving team owner Joe Gibbs his fifth title.</p>
      <p>Busch emerged from the Joe Gibbs Racing juggernaut and clinched his second title in five years after two teammates were slowed by pit road gaffes.</p>
      <p>Busch won the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway to snap a 21-race losing streak and beat Gibbs teammates Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr., as well as rival Kevin Harvick. Busch won the 2015 title and joins seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson as the only active drivers with multiple Cup championships.</p>
      <p>Busch had raced for the championship in each of the last three seasons but fell short last season in part because of his crew's own pit error.</p>
      <p>Hamlin and Truex each had issues on pit road.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>5:55 p.m.</p>
      <p>Denny Hamlin's crew messed up during a pit stop, the second potentially significant mistake by a championship contender in NASCAR's season finale.</p>
      <p>A crew member put too large a piece of tape on the air opening to Hamlin's engine, causing it to overheat and forcing him to make an unscheduled stop.</p>
      <p>Hamlin dropped from third to 19th because of the stop with 46 laps remaining and fell a lap down.</p>
      <p>Fellow Joe Gibbs Racing driver Martin Truex Jr. was forced to pit after his team mixed up the right- and left-side front tires on a stop earlier in the 400-mile race. Truex clearly had the dominant car early in the title bout.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>5:14 p.m.</p>
      <p>Kyle Busch has won the second stage of NASCAR's Cup Series championship race, taking advantage of a mistake made by Martin Truex Jr.'s crew.</p>
      <p>Busch moved to the front when Truex was forced to pit after his team mixed up the right- and left-side front tires on a pit stop at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Truex clearly had the dominant car early in the title bout.</p>
      <p>Busch led 29 laps in the 80-lap second stage. Fellow title contender Kevin Harvick crossed the start-finish line second, followed by Truex and Denny Hamlin.</p>
      <p>Truex got back on the lead lap - and in the championship hunt - thanks to a fortuitous caution.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>4:48 p.m.</p>
      <p>Martin Truex Jr.'s crew made a huge mistake in NASCAR's Cup Series championship race, one that could cost him the title.</p>
      <p>His team mixed up the right- and left-side front tires on a pit stop on lap 120 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, causing steering issues and forcing the 2017 back to pit road. Truex had led 98 laps and clearly had the dominant car in the title bout.</p>
      <p>Truex lost a lap while his crew fixed the error, but still was running in 13th when he returned to the track.</p>
      <p>Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch took the lead when Truex drove to the pits.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>4:18 p.m.</p>
      <p>Martin Truex Jr. has won the opening stage of NASCAR's Cup Series championship race, an indication he's the one to beat in the finale.</p>
      <p>Truex, one of four title contenders in the 40-car field, led the final 59 laps of the 80-lap stage at Homestead-Miami Speedway and took the checked flag more than 5 seconds ahead of Kyle Larson.</p>
      <p>Fellow championship contenders Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Denny Hamlin followed Larson across the start-finish line. Harvick led the first 20 laps in the first stage.</p>
      <p>The highest finisher among Truex, Busch, Harvick and Hamlin will win the series championship.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>3:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Retired NBA star Michael Jordan is attending the NASCAR Cup Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.</p>
      <p>Jordan, who owns the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, and championship contender Denny Hamlin are good friends - they met seven years ago - so Jordan will be rooting for the Joe Gibbs Racing driver and cheering from his pit box.</p>
      <p>"We go way back," Jordan said during an interview with NBC Sports. "He's a season-ticket holder at the Hornets. I spend a lot of time playing golf with him, and obviously I'm a big NASCAR fan, so I came out to support him."</p>
      <p>Jordan says he grew up watching NASCAR and sets "my clock every Sunday" to catch races.</p>
      <p>Jordan says he has no plans to get more involved in racing.</p>
      <p>"I've got a lot on my plate," he said. "I love being a fan. I still understand the sport, but in terms of ownership, nah, I think I'm just going to sit back and watch it and support from afar."</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>2 p.m.</p>
      <p>NASCAR will run its final race under the Monster Energy banner, as the series is set to move to a new sponsorship model in 2020.</p>
      <p>Monster Energy has sponsored the Cup Series since 2017. NASCAR top circuit has also been called the Winston Cup, the Nextel Cup and the Sprint Cup.</p>
      <p>Monster executive Mitch Covington said he hoped the company "brought a lot of fun" to NASCAR and the brand will continue to remain in the series. The name of the stock car series will simply be the NASCAR Cup Series.</p>
      <p>NASCAR is moving toward a tiered sponsorship, and those plans will be announced at the awards banquet next month.</p>
      <p>"Monster has been a phenomenal partner for us," NASCAR President Steve Phelps said Sunday. "They've had significant success with their sponsorship and entitlement."</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>1:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The NASCAR Cup Series championship will be decided at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. are racing for the title Sunday along with Stewart-Haas Racing star Kevin Harvick.</p>
      <p>Busch, Harvick and Truex are all going for a second Cup championship. Hamlin is looking for his first.</p>
      <p>Las Vegas odds-makers have basically posted the winner-take-all race as a dead heat with no clear favorite.</p>
      <p>This championship field is nearly identical to last year, with Busch, Harvick and Truex returning to the finale again. Hamlin has not been in the championship race since 2014.</p>
      <p>Homestead is moving on the 2020 schedule to March, ending its streak of 18 years as the season finale.</p>
