      <h1>Many migrants stuck in lawless Mexican border state after trying to enter US</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:26:45+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Miles</a></address>
      <p>The United States has warned its citizens to stay away from the lawless border state of Tamaulipas, assigning the area in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a> the same alert level given to war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and Syria.</p>
      <p>It’s here where many <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants">migrants</a> who made it to the United States to ask for asylum have been kept in limbo.</p>
      <p>Tamaulipas is both the location of most illegal crossings and the state where the United States has returned the most asylum seekers — 20,700 as of early October.</p>
      <p>Migrants have remained there at the crossroads of Tamaulipas for weeks and sometimes months awaiting their U.S. court dates.</p>

      <p>The Associated Press reported that gangs had a new prey with the migrants, ramping up kidnapping, extortion, and illegal crossings to extract money fueling their empires.</p>
      <p>“There’s probably nothing worse you could do in terms of overall security along the border,” said Jeremy Slack, a geographer at the University of Texas at El Paso who has studied the border region, crime and migration in Mexico. “I mean, it really is like the nightmare scenario.”</p>

      <p>The Mexico City-based Institute for Women in Migration, which has tracked kidnappings of migrants and asylum-seekers, documented 212 abductions in Tamaulipas from mid-July through Oct. 15. Of the documented kidnappings in Tamaulipas, 197 took place in Nuevo Laredo, a city of about 500,000 with international bridges contributing to the trade economy.</p>
      <p>Kennji Kizuka, a researcher for New York-based Human Rights First, said gangs were in the Nuevo Laredo office of Mexican migration, openly abducting asylum seekers who the United States had just sent back.</p>
      <p>As of August, Human Rights First had recorded 100 violent crimes against returnees. By October, after it rolled out to Tamaulipas, that had more than tripled to 340. Most involved kidnapping and extortion.</p>

      <p>“They say ‘give me 10, 15, 25.’ They tell them they are going to take them to a safer place, and they give them to the highest bidder,” Edith Garrido, a nun who works at the Casa del Migrante shelter in Reynosa, explained. “A migrant is money for them, not a person.”</p>
