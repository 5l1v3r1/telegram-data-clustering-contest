      <p>Australians may have to fork out up to 60 per cent more for their Christmas hams due to a shortage of pork set to hurt the hip pocket, an industry guru says.</p>
      <p>Victorian Farmers Federation’s pig group president Tim Kingma said the cost of pork will be up due to a surge in exports after African swine fever decimated pig herds across Europe and Asia.</p>
      <p>“There definitely is a shortage of pork around the world. The last two years, the actual hams at Christmas have been fairly cheap,” the pig farmer told 3AW radio.</p>
