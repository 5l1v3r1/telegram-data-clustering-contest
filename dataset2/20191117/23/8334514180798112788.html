      <p>The Mercedes driver, who clinched his latest title in Texas two weeks ago and had nothing at stake in the race at Interlagos, was handed a five second penalty for the penultimate lap incident.</p>
      <p>“I fully accept the responsibility. I fully accept I was coming from behind so I’m the one that touched him, not the other way round,” said the 34-year-old Briton.</p>
      <p>“I massively apologize to Albon. I went for a move... the gap was kind of there, but obviously it closed right at the end and completely my fault.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably the first time I’ve come together with someone for a long, long time... I went straight to him after the race to apologize.”</p>
      <p>Hamilton was demoted to seventh, his 32nd consecutive finish in the points and one short of his own record, while Albon ended up 14th.</p>
      <p>“His time will come,” said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner.</p>
      <p>Albon said Hamilton, on fresher tires, would probably have got past anyway further down the road but third would have been his.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t meant to be, next race,” he said.</p>
      <p>The race was won by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, the 22-year-old Dutch driver’s third victory of the season and first from pole, with French 23-year-old Pierre Gasly the runner-up for Toro Rosso.</p>
      <p>Albon, also 23, had been second when the collision occurred.</p>
      <p>“I think it was a great race and it’s great again to see the youngsters coming and driving so well,” said Hamilton. “I’m battling as hard as I can to stay in the mix.”</p>
      <p>Hamilton has still won 10 of the season’s 20 races so far but he recognized that Red Bull and their Honda engine partners were too quick.</p>
      <p>“Max did a fantastic job today. They (Red Bull) just outclassed us in terms of overall performance. We couldn’t keep up with them on the straights,” said the Briton.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I raced my heart out. I gave it everything. I left nothing on the table and I took a lot of risks today, as you saw.</p>
      <p>“We threw everything and the sink at it. Honestly, we could keep up with them in the corners but they were outshining us on the straights, therefore I don’t think there was anything we could do.”</p>
