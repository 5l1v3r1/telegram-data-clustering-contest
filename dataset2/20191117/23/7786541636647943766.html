      <p><b>ANCHORAGE, AlaskaÂ (AP)</b> - Alaskans have experienced both a record high temperature and a record amount of snowfall in the same day.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reports the Municipality of Anchorage saw snowfall of more than a foot Saturday after tying a temperature record set in 1967.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service says the city tied the high-temperature record by reaching 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7.2 Celsius) around 3 a.m.</p>
      <p>The weather service says southeast winds blew warm air into the city before the winds subsided, temperatures dropped and snow fell.</p>
      <p>Snow levels at the weather service's office broke the 1958 record of 8.3 inches (21 centimeters) by 1/10th of an inch.</p>
      <p>Officials say the snow varied from 5 inches (13 centimeters) in the city to more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) in nearby Eagle River.</p>
