      <p><b>LONDON (AP)</b> - Three years after coming to the ATP Finals as a hitting partner to the top pros, Stefanos Tsitsipas is leaving the tournament as champion.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas rallied to beat Dominic Thiem 6-7 (6), 6-2, 7-6 (4) on Sunday for the biggest title of his career, becoming the youngest champion at the season-ending event in 18 years.</p>
      <p>"I remember myself watching this event on TV and thinking, ‘Oh, these guys have done an insane year to be playing here,'" said the 21-year-old Tsitsipas, who was making his first appearance at the tournament. "And now I'm in the position to be champion, so it feels awesome."</p>
      <p>It's been quite a journey for Tsitsipas, who first met Thiem at the O2 Arena in 2016 when he was the world's top-ranked junior and was invited to be a hitting partner for the ATP Finals participants.</p>
      <p>"That is unbelievable," Tsitsipas said when reminded of that day. "I just remembered (that), first time I met Dominic was I came here as a sparring partner. I think my first hit was with Dominic. It's unbelievable, isn't it? We are now facing each other in the final."</p>
      <p>It was quite a final, too.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Greek bounced back from dropping a tight first set by racing out to a 4-0 lead in the second, and then held off the Austrian's comeback in the third.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas couldn't capitalize on another early break and a 3-1 lead in the deciding set but won the last three points of the tiebreaker, clinching the win when Thiem sent a return wide.</p>
      <p>"I missed some very close balls in the tiebreak," Thiem said. "But I cannot do anything now about it. It was a great match from both of us."</p>
      <p>The win caps a breakthrough season for Tsitsipas, who reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, won two ATP titles and became the first Greek man to break into the top 10.</p>
      <p>He also leaves London with $2.6 million in prize money for this win and joins a group of young players - including last year's ATP Finals champion Alexander Zverev and U.S. Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev - who are seen as the top up-and-coming talents and challengers to the sport's Big Three of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.</p>
      <p>The Greek has already grown quite the fan base, partly because of a Bjorn Borg-style haircut and partly because of an aggressive playing style that is a bit old-school with frequent forays to the net.</p>
      <p>"He's great for tennis, because he has a very attractive game style, one-handed backhand, comes in a lot," Thiem said. "It's great that he's up on the top. It's great that he's going to fight for the big titles in the future. I'm 100% sure of that. I'm also very sure of the fact that I can challenge him in every single match we're going to play. … I really hope that we're going to have a lot of big matches coming, the two of us."</p>
      <p>Thiem beat both Federer and five-time winner Djokovic in the group stage but lost another big final after twice finishing runner-up to Nadal at the French Open.</p>
      <p>This one was much closer than his losses to Nadal, though, which made it tougher to swallow.</p>
      <p>"That's why it's probably mentally the most brutal sport existing, because you can play such a great match and end up losing in the championship match," Thiem said. "From that point of view, it's a very disappointing loss, very hard to digest. But on the same hand, I had some amazing wins also."</p>
      <p>It is the fourth year in a row that there is a first-time champion at the ATP Finals, following wins by Andy Murray in 2016, Gregor Dimitrov in 2017 and Alexander Zverev last year.</p>
      <p>Earlier, French duo Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert won the doubles title by beating Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand 6-3, 6-4.</p>
