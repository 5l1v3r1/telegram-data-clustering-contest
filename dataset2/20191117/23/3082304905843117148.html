        <b>The history-making Stefanos Tsitsipas surprised himself with the way he blew Dominic Thiem away in the second set of a classic final.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas had “no idea” how he moved to another level in the second set of a “rollercoaster” clash with Dominic Thiem before going on to win the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old became the first Greek champion at the season-ending tournament, beating Thiem 6-7 (6-8) 6-2 7-6 (7-4) in a classic showdown at the O2 Arena on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas and Thiem put on a thrilling show in London, the aggressive sixth seed putting the disappointment of losing a first-set tie-break behind him by bossing the second set.</p>
      <p>Two-time French Open runner-up Thiem came 3-1 down to force another breaker, which Tsitsipas led 4-1 before the fifth seed stormed back again by winning the next three points.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas was not to be denied the biggest title of his fledgling career on his debut at the event, a year after he was crowned Next Gen champion, and he was at a loss to explain how he was able to level the match in such assertive fashion.</p>

      <p>“I have no clue how I played so well in the second set,” said Tsitsipas, the youngest winner of the tournament since Lleyton Hewitt in 2001.</p>
      <p>“I have no idea. I think my mind was at ease and I wasn’t really thinking of much, which led to such a great performance in the second set, breaking him twice. It was pretty much an excellent set for me.</p>
      <p>“It was pretty frustrating for me to be playing with such nerves [during the final set] for the first time in such a big event. I was a break up, I couldn’t manage to hold it.</p>
      <p>“Things were decided in the tie-break and I am so relieved by this outstanding performance and fight that I gave out on the court.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s been a rollercoaster. Holding this trophy right now feels amazing.”</p>
