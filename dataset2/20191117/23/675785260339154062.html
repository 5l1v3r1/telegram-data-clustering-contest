      <h2>Prince Andrew's excuses during a BBC Newsnight grilling stretched incredulity - and he oozed a sense of misplaced entitlement and a failure to see the revulsion at his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:14:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:14</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>No ordinary person or politician could survive in public life after a car-crash interview like the Duke of York’s.</p>
      <p>He’s now a pariah, damaging the monarchy with a misplaced entitlement and failure to see the revulsion at his friendship with, and hospitality from, a convicted paedophile.</p>
      <p>His excuses during a BBC Newsnight grilling stretched incredulity to the point where the contortions tied him up in knots.</p>
      <p>What charity, particularly those helping young and vulnerable people, particularly women, would want this toxic royal as a patron or guest at an event?</p>
      <p>Unbelievably he justified his closeness to exploitative Jeffrey Epstein rather than expressing contrition or sympathy for his friend’s young women victims. His was the tone deafness of a grotesquely privileged man.</p>
      <p>Fresh revelations may emerge and if UK or US police need to interview him, the Duke of York must help them with their inquiries.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew would be wise to retire from public life. Immediately. To do otherwise would be to damage the Queen and monarchy.</p>
      <h3>Slippery Boris</h3>
      <p>Boris Johnson can’t hide when former close friend Jennifer Arcuri seems to admit they had an affair over four years.</p>
      <p>He faces serious questions about failing to register a direct interest in promoting the American woman. Four probes were launched into whether Johnson as London Mayor broke rules designed to stamp out public corruption.</p>
      <p>Silence isn’t an acceptable option, pretending he never talks about his personal life is a fiction. At the Tory conference he said his mum voted leave in the 2016 referendum. Johnson is untrustworthy, as Arcuri and even a misled Queen know to their cost.</p>
      <h3>Grub up again</h3>
      <p>Bushtucker trials with stars scoffing animal parts is stomach-churning fun.</p>
      <p>Watching them swallow their pride in the return of I’m a Celebrity is even better.</p>
