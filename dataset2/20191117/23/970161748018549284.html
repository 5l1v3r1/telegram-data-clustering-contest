      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> legend Lee Dixon believes the absence of Aymeric Laporte is the main reason <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> have slipped so far behind <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title rivals Liverpool.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pep-guardiola/">Pep Guardiola</a>’s side, who are bidding to win a third successive league title, fell nine points and three places behind leaders Liverpool after losing at Anfield before the international break.</p>
      <p>France defender Laporte only made four appearances for City this season before suffering an injury that will keep him sidelined until 2020.</p>

      <p>And Arsenal hero Dixon said: ‘I’m trying to put it down to one thing, I would probably say Laporte getting injured for me is the biggest factor.</p>
      <p>‘I think he is a brilliant defender, I think he holds down that left-hand side of the defence, whoever is playing at left-back he can kind of control that side of the pitch and obviously his centre-half on the inside.</p>

      <p>‘So that’s a big area of pitch to replace somebody.</p>
      <p>‘You can put a body in there and I think that’s been a problem at centre-back as is well-documented, with Fernandinho going in there who’s a brilliant footballer but he’s not got that sixth sense of somebody just nicking in-behind him off his shoulder.</p>
      <p>‘The amount of times you go ‘they’re in position’ but somehow someone gets in, the little ones around the corner are difficult to deal with, especially around the box.’</p>
      <p>Dixon, speaking on The Season So Far show, added: ‘I think Laporte, his absence, has caused a real problem with that area of the pitch.</p>

      <p>‘And then taking Fernandinho out of [midfield] to put him elsewhere, there’s a kind of domino effect in the team.</p>

      <p>‘With the ball I don’t think they’re that different, they’re still brilliantly exciting to watch. But I think defensively that one area is affected a lot of the team and that’s probably why.’</p>
      <p>Following the international break, defending champions City will look to return to winning ways against Frank Lampard’s in-form Chelsea side.</p>
