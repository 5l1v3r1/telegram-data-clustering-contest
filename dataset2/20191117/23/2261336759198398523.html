      <h1>Jessica Andrade: Fan criticism interfered with my performance against Weili Zhang</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lucas Rezende</a></address>
      <p>Former UFC strawweight champion Jessica Andrade recently revealed a contributing factor to why she believes she lost her belt to Weili Zhang back in August. Knocked out in only 42 seconds by ‘Magnum,’ <a href="https://agfight.com.br/jessica-bate-estaca-revela-que-criticas-dos-fas-interferiram-em-sua-atuacao-contra-zhang/">the Brazilian told Ag Fight</a> that she allowed fan criticism get to her head before her first title defense.</p>
      <p>After knocking out then champion Rose Namajunas via power slam, in a fight she was losing up until that moment, ‘Bate-Estaca’ says she wanted to show the world she did not become the champion due to a fluke. Unfortunately, she feels that attitude ended up costing her.</p>
      <p>“At first it was really disappointing. Whether you like it or not, you go out there to prove you’ve earned that. After I beat Rose and won the belt, I heard too many comments along the lines of ‘Oh, that was luck.’ You think that doesn’t get to you? But it was something that influenced me a lot, to have this thirst to finish the fight soon and really show that I was the champion and deserved to be there—that it wasn’t luck. Because of that, I ended up losing the belt. That’s something I learned from that loss, not to care too much about people think, and just trust my abilities.”</p>
      <p>Before the loss, Jessica Andrade (20-7) was on a four-fight winning streak, with victories over Claudia Gadelha, Tecia Torres, Karolina Kowalkiewicz and the aforementioned Namajunas, back in May. The UFC has yet to announce a return to the Octagon for Andrade since her defeat in Shenzhen, China.</p>
