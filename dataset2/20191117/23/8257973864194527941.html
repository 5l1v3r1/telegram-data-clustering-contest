      <p>Nov. 17 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Baltimore-Ravens/?tps=1">Baltimore Ravens</a> star quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Lamar-Jackson/?tps=1">Lamar Jackson</a> continued his MVP season with a dominant four-touchdown performance Sunday against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Houston-Texans/?tps=1">Houston Texans</a>.</p>
      <p>During the Ravens' 41-7 blowout of the Texans, Jackson became the first player in franchise history to record multiple games with four touchdown passes. On his scores, he connected twice with running back <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark_Ingram/?tps=1">Mark Ingram</a> and once with Seth Roberts and Mark Andrews.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, Jackson tossed five touchdown passes in the Ravens' regular-season opener against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Miami-Dolphins/?tps=1">Miami Dolphins</a>. In Sunday's matchup against the Texans, he completed 17-of-24 passes for 222 yards with no interceptions. He added nine carries for 86 yards.</p>
      <p>Jackson overcame a shaky first quarter in which he was 1-for-6 for 12 yards. He got hot and completed 13 consecutive passes, which marked the fourth-longest streak in Ravens history.</p>
