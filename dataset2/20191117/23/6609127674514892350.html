        <b>BUSINESS leaders yesterday warned election pledges by Labour and the Tories could harm the economy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Confederation of British Industry chief Carolyn Fairbairn claimed Jeremy Corbyn’s nationalisation plans would “freeze investment”.</p>

      <p>Ms Fairbairn also insisted PM Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit proposals to drive down the number of immigrants by charging them £625 to cover NHS care costs risks creating a skills shortage.</p>
      <p>She told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “We need people to come and help us renew our economy.</p>

      <p>"It’s not just brightest and best, it’s people at all skill levels across our economy that we need.”</p>
      <p>And on Mr Corbyn’s plans to take BT into public ownership, she added: “That will freeze investment.</p>
      <p>“I have talked to businesses who are already sitting there thinking ‘maybe we’re next’.</p>
      <p>“This programme that is appearing to value none of the contribution that business makes will simply shut investment out of our country.”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn yesterday hinted free movement of people could continue after Brexit if Labour wins power on December 12.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “There will be a great deal of movement.”</p>
      <p>It comes amid a split among party figures after a conference motion to “maintain and extend” the freedom of movement of people was backed.</p>
      <p>But Nats Westminster candidate Stewart McDonald said: “Freedom of movement is crucial for Scotland and any attempts to restrict it would inflict lasting harm.”</p>
