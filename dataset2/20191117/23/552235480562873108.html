      <h1>John Hughes wants Falkirk talks over return to Bairns as manager</h1>
      <h2>The Bairns are hunting a new boss after sacking ray McKinnon and Hughes is keen on a return.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:15:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>John Hughes wants to speak to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk-fc">Falkirk</a> about replacing Ray McKinnon as manager a decade after he first left the Bairns.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-hughes">Hughes</a>, who was overlooked for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> job last week, is an early frontrunner.</p>
      <p>And the 55-year-old last night told <i><b>Record Sport</b></i> he is eager to get back into management and would be keen to speak with Bairns bosses over a return to his first club.</p>
      <p>Falkirk are hunting a new boss after McKinnon was sacked on Saturday following a 1-1 draw with Dumbarton that left the club languishing fourth in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-league-1">League One</a>.</p>
      <p>East Fife boss Darren Young is also understood to be in the running having narrowly missed out on the Ayr United job last month while Owen Coyle, Lee Miller, Steven Pressley and Danny Lennon are also among the bookies’ favourites.</p>
      <p>Hughes said: “I would love the opportunity to talk to Falkirk.</p>

      <p>“I really have the fire in the belly again and feel it’s the right time to get back into football management. </p>
      <p>“I have great affinity with the club and would love the chance to talk to them.</p>
      <p>“I had great success when I was there.</p>
      <p>“But I would need to see what their vision is and that’s why I want to sit down and talk to them.”</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old finished his playing career at the Falkirk Stadium in 2005 - two years after taking over as player-manager.</p>
      <p>He won the First Division title twice as a player with the Bairns, in 1994 and 2003, and again as manager in 2005 - the year he completed a league and cup double after lifting the Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>Hughes brought a number of top players to the Falkirk Stadium on loan including Tim Krul, Kasper Schmeichel and Anthony Stokes and led the club to the Scottish Cup Final in 2009, narrowly losing to Rangers at Hampden.</p>

      <p>He left weeks after that final to take over as manager at his boyhood heroes Hibs before stints at Livingston, Hartlepool, Inverness who he led to Scottish Cup glory, and Raith Rovers.</p>
      <p>McKinnon was binned after falling off the pace in League One despite starting the season as favourites. He moved to the Bairns from Championship rivals Morton in August 2018 - a move which saw the club fined for breaking SPFL rules.</p>
      <p>But he couldn't prevent Falkirk being relegated to the third tier for the first time since 1980 and has now paid the price for a stuttering start to the League One campaign.</p>
