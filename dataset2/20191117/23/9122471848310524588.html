      <h1>ESPN Computer’s Prediction For Bears-Rams Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:46:57+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Last year the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Bears were two of the NFL’s best teams. But when they face each other tonight, they’ll both be hoping for a win in order to play meaningful games in December.</p>
      <p>After winning the NFC last year, Los Angeles has looked like a shell of a once-dominant team. Since starting 3-0 they’ve lost four of their last six, and are a distant seventh in the NFC playoff standings.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Jared Goff has seldom looked like a player worth the $110 million guaranteed the team gave him, throwing 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions.</p>
      <p>Speaking of regressing, Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky has completely fallen apart in his third year as a starter. While he’s cut back on his interception rate, Trubisky just can’t seem to connect on the deep ball, and he can’t avoid the pass rush either. At 4-5 on the season, Chicago is on the outside looking in at the NFC North title and Wild Card race.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128133">ESPN’s computer model</a> has released its prediction for the Bears-Rams game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model believes that Los Angeles has this game on lock. The computer model gives the Rams a 68.2-percent chance to win tonight’s game.</h3>
      <p>Los Angeles and Chicago are both in win-now mode. A loss tonight would only further hinder their already-fading playoff hopes.</p>
      <p>Look for both teams to throw everything they’ve got into this one.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 8:20 p.m. EST on NBC.</p>
