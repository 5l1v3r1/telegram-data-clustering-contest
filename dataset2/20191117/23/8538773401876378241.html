The offensive line knows it has to find way to get the running game going. But at 6-4, the Cowboys also know they are still in first place in the NFC East as they continue to monitor what Philadelphia does. "Needed a win, needed a win on the road, needed a win outside the division," right guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16709/zack-martin">Zack Martin</a> said. "It's big for us.

The Vikings' past two wins have come down to the final play. And had it not been for some questionable late-game coaching decisions by opponents, Minnesota might not have been given those windows in the first place. It took way too long for the offense to incorporate play-action on Sunday, and the Vikings made some baffling decisions in the first half (such as running on second-and-20 while down 17 points). And a slew of boneheaded penalties leave a sour taste from this victory. Still, the Vikings are in prime position headed into a critical NFC showdown in Seattle in two weeks and remain very much in the playoff picture. <i>-- Courtney Cronin</i></p>

This time, they let a 20-0 halftime advantage get away, the third time in franchise history they did not win a game that they led at the half by at least 20 points. The Broncos have three road games in the next four weeks and still have games against playoff hopefuls -- Buffalo, Kansas City, Houston and Oakland -- on the docket. Some serious ugliness awaits if they cannot keep their edge despite all of the disappointments. <i>-- Jeff Legwold</i></p>

Mack rushed for 109 yards on 14 carries, and Williams had a career-high 116 yards on 13 rushes. The 264 yards rushing as a team were the most for the Colts since they ran for 275 yards against Chicago on Nov. 21, 2004. Mack and Williams are the first two Indianapolis players to rush for at least 100 yards in the same game since Randy McMillan and Albert Bentley did so in 1985. <i>-- Mike Wells</i></p>

The Colts didn't do anything fancy, either: They lined up and manhandled the Jaguars' defensive front.

The defense hasn't allowed a touchdown since the end of the second quarter against Seattle (Week 8), keeping both New Orleans and Carolina out of the end zone. In the past three games, the Falcons have recorded 13 sacks, 25 quarterback hits and four interceptions. "If we keep playing the way we are as a defense, offense and special teams put together, that's the team we believe we can be," free safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16882/ricardo-allen">Ricardo Allen</a> said.

But his four interceptions against the Falcons and eight in the past four games are alarming. Carolina (5-5) has no chance to make the playoffs if this trend continues. Sunday's loss might have been the beginning of the end of Carolina's playoff hopes.

The run game has struggled without tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3040151/george-kittle">George Kittle</a>, the defense has been vulnerable to quick passing and mobile quarterbacks, and quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a> has a habit of coughing up a costly turnover or two every week. With Green Bay, Baltimore and New Orleans next on the schedule, the 49ers (9-1) will need to clean that up if they want to come out on the other side still in charge of the NFC playoff picture. <i>-- Nick Wagoner</i></p>

And now they'll have to stew in the frustration of losing their fourth straight game until Dec. 1. Quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray">Kyler Murray</a> was visibly emotional after the game in a way he's never shown before. The remaining schedule doesn't get any easier with the Rams twice, Steelers, Browns and Seahawks. The Cardinals will either turn their frustration into wins or continue on to win as many games as they did last season. <i>-- Josh Weinfuss</i></p>

It falls on Wentz to thrive amid the adversity and make everyone around him better, as other top-end quarterbacks -- such as his counterpart Sunday (Brady) -- have done over their careers. That might be a tall order, or even unfair, but these are the moments franchise quarterbacks have to find a way to get it done. <i>-- Tim McManus</i></p>

The victory over the Bengals closed out a 3-0 homestand for Oakland, which improved to 6-4. And with a game at the Jets (3-7) next week, the Raiders remain on pace to face the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Dec. 1 with first place in the AFC West on the line. <i>-- Paul Gutierrez</i></p>

Finding solutions for the rest of the passing attack, however, may not be so simple. Oakland tallied five sacks against Cincinnati's struggling offensive line, and the receivers averaged only 1.4 yards of space per target, one of the lowest registered by any group of wideouts this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats. On a day when the offense was all but swallowed whole in its last visit to Oakland's "Black Hole," the Bengals showed they need more than a young quarterback to fix an ailing passing attack. <i>-- Ben Baby</i></p>

      <p><b>Before the end-of-game melee, the story was the Steelers' woeful offense.</b> Pittsburgh's top three offensive threats -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045147/james-conner">James Conner</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3932905/diontae-johnson">Diontae Johnson</a> -- went out because of injures over the course of the game. Pittsburgh averaged 3.7 yards per play, and Rudolph threw four picks to one touchdown. "At this point, we were just not good enough," guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12883/ramon-foster">Ramon Foster</a> said. "We had just not been supporting our defense. As a whole, we just have to be better. Everyone is going to say whatever they want about us, but we are sticking together and making it happen. ... This is probably as humbling as it can be on a marquee-type game. Very humbling." <i>-- Brooke Pryor</i></p>
