If you haven't gotten on the <b>Billy on the Street </b>train yet, we have several suggestions for your journey! Get ready to see the power of a dollar.</p>

      <p>To celebrate the anniversary of <b>Billy on the Street</b>, as well as the show's Netflix debut, Eichner hits the streets with Chris Evans. Get ready for great Gina Gershon references, celebrity surprises, and Disney Plus commentary.</p>
      <h3>2 "Would You Have Sex With Paul Rudd?"</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Paul-Rudd">Paul Rudd</a> gets a hilarious confidence boost in this randomized poll of the New York City population. It turns out a lot of people are willing to have sex with Paul Rudd, and there's no shortage of hilarious one-liners.</p>
      <h3>3 "Chris Pratt Lightning Round!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYISejAY36s" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We can't believe we live in a world where people don't know who Chris Pratt is, but apparently some New Yorkers are mistaking Pratt for some random VH1 star, a Star Wars newcomer, and even Chris Evans. Don't worry, Chris Pratt, we still love you.</p>
      <h3>4 "Do Gay People Care About John Oliver?"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IAFS1gwzTTs" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It turns out a large percentage of the gay population in New York City have no idea who John Oliver is. But, spoiler alert, they are big fans Wendy Williams.</p>
      <h3>5 "Death Rogen! With Seth Rogen"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/diN92St7FA8" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Billy Eichner gives <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Seth-Rogen">Seth Rogen</a> his Tom Sawyer moment in this episode. He tricks audience members into thinking Seth Rogen has passed away, so that Seth Rogen can witness their reactions as he plays cameraman.</p>
      <h3>6 "Billy on the Street With Emma Stone!!!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZ01n6lJyn8" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Billy Eichner gives us further evidence that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Emma-Stone">Emma Stone</a> is the bubble tea of humans in this episode. He might not have succeeded in convincing the actress to create an Instagram account, but we would definitely watch these two host a talk show.</p>
      <h3>7 "Christmas Carol Ambush With Amy Poehler"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rABZe2xxVIY" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It would be our dream to be accosted by a dressed-up Billy Eichner and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Amy-Poehler">Amy Poehler</a> on the streets. It would be even better if we all got to sing Christmas carols together. It turns out, however, this sentiment is not shared by many New Yorkers.</p>
      <h3>8 "Lightning Round (Name a Woman!)"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzDlS6JPUtE" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It shouldn't be hard to name a woman, but when you're put on the spot, it can be a challenge. Watch the cringe-worthy interviews on this segment, and rejoice at the fact that it wasn't you he asked.</p>
      <h3>9 "The New York Bubble With Stephen Colbert!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4cdUVYNgCMU" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Stephen-Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> and Billy Eichner team up for this wonderful investigation into the "New York Bubble." Get ready for some insightful political commentary.</p>
      <h3>10 "It's Not Pitbull — It's Amy Poehler!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCa_Xgy_ank" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We know we listed <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Amy-Poehler">Amy Poehler</a> segments twice on this list, but she's the MVP of celebrity cameos. The title is self-explanatory, but trust us when we say the big reveals are hilarious every time.</p>
      <h3>11 "Quizzed in the Face With Elena"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EobrSmCJ9dE" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We think Eichner met his match with this Quizzed in the Face segment. Let's just say this New York resident isn't taking sh*t from anyone.</p>
      <h3>12 "It's Debra Messing, You Gays!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wl_1nKFCNiM" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Watch Eichner bring joy to the residents of New York City when he presents them with the gorgeous <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Debra-Messing">Debra Messing</a>. We're not sure what workout this duo is doing in their spare time, but they manage to run all over the city.</p>
      <h3>13 "Billy on the Street With the Jonas Brothers!!!!!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkWzpZftfi0" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We were elated when the Jonas Brothers announced their reunion, but apparently not everyone got the memo. Watch this adorable segment starring our favorite musical trio.</p>
      <h3>14 "Watch Rachel Dratch Run the Julia Roberts Obstacle Course!"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlOuqhmsWLk" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Even without watching <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Julia-Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>'s entire movie reel, we can still appreciate the hilarity that is this intense obstacle course. Rachel Dratch is a true sport, and is even willing to dip her entire arm into crude oil to find the pelican for the Pelican Brief portion.</p>
      <h3>15 "Billy &amp; Patton Oswalt: Does Shakira Know What This Is?"</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0POlhP-X1M" width="728" height="409" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>We're huge fans of Patton Oswalt, and our fandom was even more solidified after this lightning round with Billy. In case you were wondering, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Shakira">Shakira</a> does not know what L.L. Bean is nor Wisconsin, according to Oswalt.</p>
