      <h1>DeAndre Hopkins is sick of NFL’s pass interference controversy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:15:24+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Fischer</a></address>
      <p>Houston star DeAndre Hopkins seemingly called for the NFL to replace senior V.P. of officiating Al Riveron following another controversial pass interference ruling during the Ravens’ blowout win over the Texans on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Early in the first quarter, Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey grabbed Hopkins and twisted him away from the ball in what appeared to be blatant pass interference.</p>
      <p>The on-field officials did not make the call, and Riveron did not overturn it when Texans head coach Bill O’Brien challenged the original ruling.</p>
      <p>“As a leader in the NFL, we need someone new in New York deciding calls,” <a href="https://twitter.com/DeAndreHopkins/status/1196181477488246790?s=20">Hopkins tweeted</a> after the game.</p>

      <p>The NFL<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/26/pass-interference-is-now-reviewable-in-the-nfl/"> implemented a rule before this season</a> allowing coaches to challenge pass interference calls or no-calls up until the two-minute warning of either half in response to an egregious missed call during last year’s NFC Championship. Nevertheless, coaches had lost 32 of 33 pass interference calls leading into Sunday’s action, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28101432/stop-challenging-pass-interference-nfl-coaches-why-just-wasting-outs">according to ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson said “everybody saw [the pass interference],” and said the play could have been a turning point although the Baltimore won, 41-7.</p>
      <p>“I have no idea what pass interference is anymore,” <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/17/bill-obrien-i-have-no-idea-what-pass-interference-is-anymore/">O’Brien told reporters.</a> “No idea.”</p>
      <p>About 40 miles south of Baltimore, Jets coach Adam Gase won a rare challenge after receiver Demaryius Thomas was called for offensive pass interference in his team’s win in Washington. The play was overturned after it was determined Washington linebacker Cole Holcomb initiated contact.</p>
