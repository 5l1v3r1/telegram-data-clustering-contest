      <p>A Langley convenience store owner said he was a little shaken up, but physically unharmed after a man took a swing at him with a hatchet during a confrontation Friday (Nov. 15).</p>
      <p>Narender Puri said he was in a back room at Ed’s In Brookswood when he heard someone raising their voice with one of his staff.</p>
      <p>“He was saying he wanted smokes,” Puri told the<b> Langley Advance Times</b>.</p>
      <p>“The way he was shouting and screaming, he didn’t sound normal. I said, go away, I’m gonna call the police.”</p>
      <p>That was when the man pulled a hatchet out and started swinging at Puri, a moment captured by the store security video system.</p>
      <p>“He swung at me a couple of time,” Puri recalled.</p>
      <p>Puri, a former bodybuilder and nationally-ranked boxer in India, had no trouble avoiding the hatchet.</p>
      <p>When another staffer moved to intervene with a baseball bat, the man with the hatchet fled, but not before Puri was able to grab the weapon away from him.</p>
      <p>There was no intent to injure the man, Puri said, only to get him to leave.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to be criminals, ourselves.”</p>
      <p>Puri said by then, 911 had already been called, and Langley RCMP arrived in time to arrest the suspect outside the store at 207th St. and 42nd Ave.</p>
      <p>Puri said the incident left him a little rattled.</p>
      <p>“I was upset,” he admitted.</p>

      <p>Puri could only recall one other similar incident in the 12 years he has been running Ed’s.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Puri took over, a robber with a metal bar hit a staffer, who needed stitches, he related, adding that robber was also arrested and later convicted, and sentenced to three-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>The store has also been a target of after-hours break-in attempts, he added.</p>
      <p>Puri said he has been gratified by the community response to the incident, describing how customers have been coming by to express sympathy and show support, as well as online.</p>
      <p>Langley RCMP report that 33-year-old Langley resident Rory Welsh was arrested and charged with robbery following a 1 p.m. incident at the store.</p>
      <p>According to the police report, a man was demanding a cigar when a confrontation took place.</p>
      <p>Welsh is scheduled to have a bail hearing on Tuesday.</p>
