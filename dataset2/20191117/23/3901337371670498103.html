      <p>Antoine Griezmann ended his goal drought for France on Sunday evening, as the World champions defeated Albania 2-0 to finish top of Group H in the EURO 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Les Bleus made five changes to the side that edged Moldova on Thursday, with goalkeeper Steve Mandanda getting a run , while Kylian Mbappe settled for a place on the bench with illness alongside N'Golo Kante.</p>
      <p>The visitors got the opener with their first attack in the eighth minute through Corentin Tolisso's header at the near post from Antoine Griezmann's well weighted free-kick.</p>
      <p>France were soaking up the pressure and going forward with pace and they doubled thelead in the 31st minute thanks to Griezmann, who turned home Leo Dubois' cross.</p>
      <p>The early stages of the second stanza saw the roles reversed, with Albania doing the most defending as France were taking complete control of the match.</p>
      <p>Olivier Giroud came close to making adding a third goal for the visitors in the 71st minute with a curling strike from the edge of the box that came off the inside of the post.</p>
      <p>Deschamps finally made his first change with 15 minutes remaining, after bringing on Lucas Digne in place of Benjamin Mendy to tighten up at the back.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Les Bleus, who had already qualified, held on to win 2-0 and clinched top spot in Group H, while Albania, whose hopes of qualifying had ended, finished in fourth place.</p>
