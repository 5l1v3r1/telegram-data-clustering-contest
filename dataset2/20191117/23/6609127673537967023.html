        <b>FOR once the Conservatives and Labour have triggered some agreement with their electioneering — though it’s most definitely not the ringing endorsement the parties’ leaders might have wanted.</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, key election pledges by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are potentially dangerous to the economy.</p>

      <p>And don’t take our word for it.</p>
      <p>This is the view of Carolyn Fairbairn, boss of the CBI.</p>
      <p>She has issues with both the PM’s post-Brexit immigration crackdown — and Mr Corbyn’s off-the-wall proposal of free broadband for everyone.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the Tory scheme to drive down the number of people coming here risks creating a skills shortage, it seems.</p>
      <p>As Ms Fairbairn told Sky News: “We need people to come and help us renew our economy.”</p>
      <p>And just as troubling is the Labour leader’s plot to take BT Openreach into public ownership.</p>

      <p>The industry boss added: “That will freeze investment. I have talked to businesses who are already sitting there thinking ‘maybe we’re next’.”</p>
      <p>So, in summary, major pledges by both main parties have gone down like a lead balloon with business chiefs.</p>
      <p>But there is a long road ahead in the race for No10.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn have the time and opportunity to try to win over reluctant industry leaders.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Whether the public will be persuaded too remains to be seen.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Thank you all</h3>
      <p>
        <b>FOR half a century The Sun has shone thanks to one group above all. You, our vast army of readers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many others have contributed to our success, of course. Not least the tens of thousands of Sun staff who have come and gone over the years.</p>
      <p>But on Day One, in November 1969 when we relaunched as a tabloid, our slogan was “Forward with the people”.</p>
      <p>“We will never forget YOUR place in The Sun,” our first Sun Says editorial declared. “We want you at all times to feel part of it. We want The Sun to be the people’s newspaper.”</p>
      <p>Fifty years later we like to think we have lived up to that. And today we want to give something back to all of you who made us No1 and have kept us there.</p>
      <p>That’s why we are announcing a £1million giveaway to small, deserving charities of YOUR choice.</p>
      <p>We have run hundreds of campaigns in the public interest. And our readers are the most generous in the world, helping to raise about £100million for charities over the decades.</p>
      <p>But now it’s our turn to give directly to causes close to your heart. Let us know what they are.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Finally, to all of you from all of us at The Sun in 2019 . . . thank you. Here’s to the next 50 years.</b>
      </p>
