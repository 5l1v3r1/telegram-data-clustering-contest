      <p>John Barrowman worried I'm A Celebrity fans this evening after his appearance on Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old looked almost unrecognisable as he sported shaved gray hair on the ITV2 spin-off show.</p>
      <p>But some feared that he looked ill and flocked to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to comment.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "John Barrowman looking unrecognisable on #ExtraCamp #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Not trying to be rude but is John Barrowman okay? He looks completely different, didn't recognise him at first #ImACeleb #ImACelebExtraCamp #ExtraCamp."</p>
