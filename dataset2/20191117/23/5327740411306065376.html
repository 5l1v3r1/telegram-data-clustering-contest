      <h1>Teen with cancer whose viral video urged Canadians to vote has died, uncle tweets</h1>
      <h2>Maddison Yetman had been looking forward to voting in her first federal election since junior high school</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T23:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>A terminally ill cancer patient who recorded a video from her hospital bed that urged Canadians to vote has died, the teen’s family says.</p>
      <p>Brent Williamson, who was Maddison Yetman’s uncle, says in a Twitter post that the young Winnipeg woman died Saturday.</p>
      <p>Yetman’s video in October, made shortly after her diagnosis at age 18, showed her holding up cards with hand-written messages saying she managed to vote in advance of the Oct. 21 federal election despite having terminal cancer.</p>
      <p>The final card said “#WhatsYourExcuse.”</p>
      <p>Within hours of being posted, it was viewed more than 47,000 times.</p>

      <p>A message posted on Yetman’s social media accounts Sunday said that in lieu of flowers, mourners should donate to the Nature Conservancy of Canada.</p>
      <p>“Our beautiful little peanut passed away yesterday. She was stronger than anyone could imagine and left a wonderful mark on this world,” Williamson said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Yetman had been feeling sick for a few days, with achy bones and sore joints, when her family got together for brunch on Oct. 6. They took her to a medical clinic when her symptoms worsened. Soon after, she was admitted into the Health Sciences Centre’s cancer ward.</p>
      <p>Within five days, Yetman, learned she has a type of cancer called sarcoma and it had spread through her body, into her blood and bone marrow.</p>
      <p>She was given days to weeks to live, Williamson told The Canadian Press last month.</p>
      <p>Yetman had been looking forward to voting in her first federal election since junior high school and cast her vote from her hospital bed.</p>
      <p>“If I can find the time to vote, you can find the time to vote,” Yetman said in the video.</p>
