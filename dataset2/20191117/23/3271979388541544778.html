      <p><b>Angelina Jolie</b> is not plotting to move with her six kids to Africa behind <b>Brad Pitt</b>’s back, despite a made-up tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop can</b> correct the phony story. There’s no truth to it.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> earlier this month, Jolie noted that she’d prefer to live abroad with her children, but she has to stay in Los Angeles “where their father chooses to live.” The actress further noted that she and the kids will “break ground on a home in Africa” next year. According to <i><b>In Touch</b></i>, however, what Jolie didn’t say is that she plans to stay there permanently.</p>
      <p>“She doesn’t play by anyone’s rules, especially not Brad’s, and she wants her kids raised out of the country,” a so-called “family insider” tells the magazine. “Her plan is for the house there to be their new home base.” The supposed source goes on to say that Pitt “wouldn’t be surprised if stating publicly that she’s building a home in Africa is some kind of ploy. She knows Brad can’t just pick up and move there as well. And if he doesn’t let the children go, well, it makes him look like the bad guy.” We’re not quite sure how Pitt’s reluctance to let his estranged wife take his kids away and move to a different continent would make him look like a “bad guy.”</p>
      <p>Still, the questionable tipster continues, “Moving to Africa, putting that much distance between them, would ruin any chance Brad has of rebuilding those relationships. This is just another way for Angelina to take control of the kids. Brad misses his kids desperately, and it feels like Angie is just rubbing salt in his wounds.”</p>
      <p>Actually, the magazine cherrypicked quotes from <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29644077/angelina-jolie-interview-2019/">Jolie’s <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> interview</a> to create its fake narrative. Here’s a quote of hers the story doesn’t mention: “I would love to live abroad and will do so as soon as my children are 18.” The actress made a point of noting that she can’t move out of the U.S. due to her ongoing custody battle and won’t do so until her kids are of legal age. Last year, <a href="https://theblast.com/c/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-custody-officially-filed">Jolie and Pitt reached a temporary custody agreement</a> that would allow him to spend more time with the kids. The actress has no intention of breaking that agreement or defying a court’s order to grant Pitt more custodial rights.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with an individual in Jolie’s camp, who tells us <i>In Touch</i>’s article is simply “not true.” The actress isn’t scheming to permanently move to Africa with her kids. In fact, doing so would be against the law and could result in her losing custody altogether. It’s just not a reality.</p>
      <p>Last year, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the magazine for making up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-kids-choose/">Jolie begging the kids to choose her over Pitt</a> and trying to turn them against their dad. The tabloid simply doesn’t know what’s going on amid the couple’s custody battle. This latest take on the subject is more fiction.</p>
