      <p>A fireman called out to reports of a teenage boy struck by a car as he walked home from a party discovered the victim was his own nephew.</p>
      <p>A 16-year-old boy died after being struck by a car as he walked home from a house party in Ireland.</p>
      <p>The boy, named locally as Nathan Lawlor Hough, from Rathkeale, County Limerick, died after being hit in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>He was struck at around 3.45am, as he walked in an area about 2km outside the village of Adare, on the N21 Limerick to Tralee Road.</p>
      <p>Tragically, his own uncle was on shift for the Rathkeale Fire Service and is understood to have been part of the crew called to respond to the reports of a fatal collision, the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/limerick-teenager-tragically-dies-after-20902555">Irish Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>According to police sources, Nathan had earlier attended a joint 18th birthday party in a local pub before attending a house party in the area with a group of friends.</p>
      <p>Garda sources told the Irish Mirror they believed Nathan had been socialising at birthday party celebrations in the area and was walking home when he died.</p>

      <p>Friends were said to be in total shock.</p>
      <p>“He was a gorgeous looking fella and everyone knew him as a good guy,” one source said.</p>
      <p>When gardai arrived an ambulance crew was already on scene, making valiant efforts to save the boy’s life, however he was pronounced dead on the roadway.</p>
      <p>A postmortem is due to take place on the boy’s body at 9.30am Monday morning, at University Hospital Limerick.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Aileen Magner, Newcastle West garda station, passed on her sympathies to the boy’s family, and said the investigation was ongoing.</p>
      <p>“We are still investigating the last movements of Nathan,” Supt Magner said.</p>
      <p>“I’d appeal for anybody who may have been passing at the time and who may have noticed anything unusual, or anybody who may have dash cam footage, their help would be appreciated,” she added.</p>
      <p>The male driver of the car involved was not injured and was “helping gardai with their enquiries” into the fatal collision, according to garda source.</p>
      <p>Local Fianna Fáil councillor Bridie Collins said everyone in the village was “shocked” by the “tragedy”.</p>
      <p>“It’s an awful tragedy for whoever it is and their family, there is a young wee fella not coming home. There for the grace of god go any of us that any our own (children) come home every night they go out,” Ms Collins said.</p>
      <p>“All I can say is that it is a horrendous tragedy. I’m shocked. My heart bleeds for the family. It’s a wasted life, 16 years old.”</p>
      <p>“The sadness around is that this 16 year old did not come home today. It’s the end of a very short life, and life is so short and so precious,” she added.</p>
      <p>“My sympathy goes out to his family. We are all really shocked.</p>
      <p>"Myself and my husband have just been talking about our own children, getting them through the teenage years and you still worry about them – they are in their early twenties – and God, I just can’t imagine how I would feel if one of them weren’t coming home, it just doesn’t bear thinking about.”</p>
      <p>A garda spokeswoman said: “Anyone with information is asked to contact Newcastle West Garda Station on 069 – 20650, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station.”</p>
