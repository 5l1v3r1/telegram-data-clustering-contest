      <h3>Sacked rugby union star Israel Folau is in hot water after suggesting the NSW bushfire crisis was a “taste of God’s judgment” for legalising same-sex marriage and abortion.</h3>

      <p>Folau made the comments -- which were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/592277641115135/videos/528446637884157">streamed online</a> -- during an address at a church in Sydney.</p>
      <p>FIVEaa’s Stephen Rowe said on Monday’s FIVEaa Breakfast show:</p>
      <blockquote>“I heard you guys bring up Izzy Folau…<br/><br/>“Do we the media have to peddle and perpetuate Izzy’s views? I think 99 per cent of us -- your listeners said it earlier -- we don’t believe what Izzy’s saying and he’s irrelevant.<br/><br/>“He was a sporting star -- he’s not now. He’s a disgraced, sacked sporting star, so I think he’s irrelevant and so too should his views be… he can run his own race. None of us believe him.”</blockquote>
