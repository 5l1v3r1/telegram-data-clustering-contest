      <p>If your smartphone is not on this list, be patient. More devices are getting this update. Note that this list contains devices with MIUI 11 based on Android 10. There are other devices with MIUI 11 on top of Android 9 Pie. This new feature is really interesting because there are some sounds that we really like but seem to be too loud for night time. Now, with this new feature, we can customize a particular sound for the day time and another for night time. In fact, we can set the notification sound to change depending on the hour.</p>
