      <h1>Pope Compares Politicians Who Rage Against Gays and Jews to Hitler</h1>
      <h2>In departure from prepared address, Francis says some leaders' speeches remind him of the Nazi dictator's</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:34:06+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968129" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Pope Francis said on Friday politicians who rage against homosexuals, gypsies and Jews remind him of Hitler.</p>
      <p>"It is not coincidental that at times there is a resurgence of symbols typical of Nazism," Francis said in an address to participants of an international conference on criminal law.</p>
      <p>"And I must confess to you that when I hear a speech (by) someone responsible for order or for a government, I think of speeches by Hitler in 1934, 1936," he said, departing from his prepared address.</p>
      <p>"With the persecution of Jews, gypsies, and people with homosexual tendencies, today these actions are typical (and) represent 'par excellence' a culture of waste and hate. That is what was done in those days and today it is happening again."</p>
      <p>During the 1933-45 Nazi regime in <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-germany-1.5599037">Germany</a>, six million Jews were killed and homosexuals and gypsies were among those sent to extermination camps.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis did not name any politicians or countries as the targets of his criticism.</p>
      <p>In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro had a history of making homophobic, racist and sexist public remarks before he took office on Jan. 1. He told one interviewer he would rather have a dead son than a gay son.</p>

      <p>In May, Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah extended a moratorium on the death penalty to incoming legislation prohibiting gay sex, seeking to temper a global backlash led by celebrities such as George Clooney and Elton John.</p>
      <p>The United Nations had warned Brunei it would be violating human rights by implementing Islamic laws that would allow death by stoning for adultery and homosexuality.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Pope Francis has also denounced a resurgence of <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-anti-semitism-1.5598882">anti-Semitism</a> in Europe.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, in improvised remarks at his general audience, he said: "Today the habit of persecuting Jews is beginning to be reborn. Brothers and sisters: this is neither human nor Christian; the Jews are our brothers and sisters and must not be persecuted! Understood?"</p>
      <p>Last week, a Vatican cardinal said he was "disgusted" by anti-Semitic abuse directed <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-italian-holocaust-survivor-gets-bodyguards-after-surge-of-death-threats-1.8095024">at an 89-year-old Italian senator</a> and Holocaust survivor, who was given police protection after receiving death threats.</p>
      <p>In July, a European Union study said young Jewish Europeans experience more anti-Semitism than their parents, with a rise in abuse coming in emails, text messages and social media postings.</p>
      <p>More than 80 percent of Jews of all ages said they felt anti-Semitism had increased on the Internet over the past five years and around 70 percent  said they faced more hostility in public, the study found.</p>
