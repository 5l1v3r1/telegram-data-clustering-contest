      <p>Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) efforts to thwart billionaire businessman Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s plans to model the shape of his new 4×4 on JLR’s Defender have failed.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times today reported that Ratcliffe, the founder of Ineos, had won his challenge to JLR’s attempt to trademark the Defender’s shape.</p>

      <p>Ratcliffe, who is planning to build the Grenadier in Bridgend in south Wales, has been locked in a long-term battle with JLR over the Defender’s design, on which he has had designs for several years.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Ineos said that it would treat the Defender’s “much-loved shape like a listed building”. </p>
      <p>The project is designed to fill the gap left by JLR’s car, which ceased production in 2016 because the model no longer met modern environmental and safety standards.</p>
      <p>The company is due to release a replacement model, which is being manufactured in Slovakia with the latest technology, in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Initially, Ratcliffe tried to buy manufacturing equipment for the Defender from JLR, but was rejected.</p>
      <p>The company, which is a subsidiary of Indian automotive firm Tata Motors, then sought to trademark six variants, from the original 1948 model to the 2016 edition.</p>
      <p>However, last month the Intellectual Property Office decided that the Defender’s shape was not different enough from that of other 4×4 models for a trademark to be justified. </p>
      <p>JLR is fighting the verdict in the High Court. The company said: “The Defender is an iconic vehicle which is part of Jaguar Land Rover’s past, present and future.</p>
      <p>“Its unique shape is recognised around the world, with the heritage shape being protected in other key markets.”</p>
      <p>JLR is fiercely protective of its Defender. In 2016, it prevented a Canadian company from using the name ‘Defender’ for an all-terrain vehicle. </p>

      <p>Ratcliffe, who is third on the Sunday Times rich list with £18.2bn, agreed a deal in September to manufacture the new car at Brocastle in Wales, near to a Ford plant which is due to close in 2020 with the loss of 1,700 jobs.</p>
      <p>It is hoped that the new project will provide up to 500 jobs.</p>
