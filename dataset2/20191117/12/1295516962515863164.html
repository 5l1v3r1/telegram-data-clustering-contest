      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/aquaman-film/"><i>Aquaman</i></a> star Willem Dafoe is weighing in on <a href="https://www.cbr.com/martin-scorsese-slams-marvel-films/">Martin Scorsese's recent criticisms of superhero movies</a> and firing his own shots at the industry.</p>
      <p>As well as playing Nuidis Vulko in James Wan's underwater adventure, Dafoe famously played Norman Osborn, aka the Green Goblin, in Sam Raimi's <i>Spider-Man</i>. While the 64-year-old is no stranger to comic book movies, it seems he isn't a fan of how the genre has evolved.</p>

      <p>Speaking at <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484977/willem-dafoe-finds-superhero-movies-too-long-noisy-and-overshot-the-industry-outgrew-itself">New York's 92Y</a> after a screening of his latest movie, Dafoe didn't hold back with his own critique of superhero movies. "I mean, I’ve done some of those movies, and they’re fun," said Dafoe. "But also, even then, I got lucky because they’ve been personal. For example, <i>Spider-Man</i> was great fun because Sam Raimi made that like it was a little independent film."</p>

      <p>He went on to praise Raimi's 2002 movie as being something new, but thinks modern comic book movies are getting too big for their boots. Dafoe claims "the industry outgrew itself" and added: "They spend a lot of money on big set pieces, because that’s what delivers the action, and I find them too long and too noisy."</p>
      <p>Dafoe's latest movie is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/lighthouse-review-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe/"><i>The Lighthouse</i></a>, which is a low-budget psychological horror with Robert Pattinson. Although Dafoe's comments aren't quite as scathing as Scorsese's, he's clearly unimpressed with Hollywood's current obsession with superhero movies. That being said, he realizes his comments are controversial and seems to understand he has a lot to thank the genre for. "But let’s not get into this [laughs]," concluded Dafoe. "I don’t want to bite the hand that feeds me. But, no, seriously, folks. Look, those aren’t the movies I run to."</p>
