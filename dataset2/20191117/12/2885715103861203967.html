      <h3>ARIES (Mar 21 – Apr. 20)</h3>
      <p>This may be a profoundly restless week, one which lays the ground for a series of deep changes in the most intimate and secret realms of your life. By the end of the month you will be on a dramatic new emotional course. And when partners realise what’s going on, they’ll see you in an entirely new light.</p>
      <h3>TAURUS (Apr. 21 – May 21)</h3>
      <p>In spite of what close companions may believe, you must realise that business considerations are highly relevant to your romantic life. The confidence bred by success will encourage you to expect more of other people socially, no longer settling for second best.</p>

      <h3>GEMINI (May 22 – June 21)</h3>
      <p>You must make a choice affecting a person who touches you on your deepest emotional levels. You know now that an unsatisfactory situation can carry on no longer and that it is up to you to call a halt. You also know in your heart that once you have made a decision the storm clouds will disappear.</p>
      <h3>CANCER (June 22 – July 23)</h3>
      <p>A powerful consortium of planets is urging you to play it safe and tuck yourself away in your shell for a while. What this means is that you must choose very carefully how and when you act, particularly if other people are involved. Remember that the whole world is bound to move your way.</p>
      <h3>LEO (July 24 – Aug. 23)</h3>
      <p>The source of any trouble will be people who don’t know you very well. Quite why they should make such unjustified assumptions about your plans and intentions is not clear, but may be due to your typical Leonine refusal to explain yourself.</p>
      <h3>VIRGO (Aug. 24 – Sept. 23)</h3>
      <p>You have been faced with a number of important decisions, as is right and proper for any wise and thoughtful person, which have brought in their train a degree of self-criticism and self-doubt. Now, though, is the time for a determined boost in your confidence.</p>
      <h3>LIBRA (Sept. 24 – Oct. 23)</h3>
      <p>Those who have planned holidays or time off are well placed. Those who have not, will be champing at the bit, eager for a spot of adventure. On a more down-to-earth note, you should seize this opportunity to resolve any questions with legal overtones. And don’t bend the rules.</p>
      <h3>SCORPIO (Oct. 24 – Nov. 22)</h3>
      <p>As the days pass you will begin to feel much happier about the state of play in your associations with both friends and lovers. Venus’ passionate relationship with Pluto brings matters to a head one way or the other, and you will decide to stick with your current situation.</p>
      <h3>SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 – Dec. 22)</h3>
      <p>If you learn how to handle opposition from partners and rivalry from colleagues, you will gain in experience to the point where you’ll be in an ideal position to handle the next phase of growth. In the meantime, all you can really do is offer suggestions, provide advice and assistance and generally play second fiddle.</p>
      <h3>CAPRICORN (Dec. 23 – Jan. 20)</h3>
      <p>You will be called to account for your financial goals. It is not possible to say for sure whether the outcome will be favourable or not, although I would guess that it will be. What is certain is that there will be a flurry of activity which will drive other, more personal concerns underground for a while.</p>
      <h3>AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 – Feb. 19)</h3>
      <p>Mercury, god of communication will give you the wit and speed of mind to overcome any difficulties following on from the influence of belligerent Mars in your house of relationships. If partners give in to the demands of unreason and anger, you can do no worse than present them with the facts.</p>
      <h3>PISCES (Feb. 20 – Mar 20)</h3>
      <p>The pressure to implement further changes will reach a peak and from there on will begin to die down, finally fading out at the end of July. This period will be ideal for reaching agreements whether property transactions are underway, or if the matters bothering you are intensely personal.</p>
