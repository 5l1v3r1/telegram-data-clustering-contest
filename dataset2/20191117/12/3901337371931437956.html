      <p>Brazil captain Thiago Silva was not happy with Argentina star Lionel Messi after he told Selecao head coach Tite to shut up.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/brazil-coach-explains-argument-with-lionel-messi/667593">Read: Brazil Coach Explains Argument With Messi</a></b></p>
      <p>Argentina got the better of Brazil in the Superclasico on Friday evening, with Messi netting the game's only goal in the first half.</p>
      <p>Brazil coach Tite revealed after the game that Messi told him to shut up after he asked the referee to book another player, which did not sit well with Silva.</p>
      <p>"It's hard to understand when we talk about respect on the pitch, and one of the most admired players in the world does that, you don't do that to an older person but being that it was a coach... as much as there is rivalry, respect has to come first," Silva was quoted as saying by <i>Sport-English.</i></p>
      <p>Silva was also not impressed with the way Messi tried to inlfuence the game and feels the referees need to be stronger.</p>
      <p>"He wanted to rule over the game," he added.</p>
      <p>"He kicked two people and the referee did nothing. I argued with the ref and he kept laughing. You have to put admiration to one side," said the defender.</p>
      <p>"He always looks to force the referee to give them free-kicks in dangerous areas, he always acts in that way. We spoke with some players who play in Spain and the same thing happens, he looks to control the game and the referee's decisions.</p>
      <p>"In the Champions League he doesn't have that advantage because the referees are tougher. You don't see him trying to rule so much. There are referees that, because of their admiration for him, start to weigh in on his side. That we didn't have Neymar on our side was a disadvantage."</p>
