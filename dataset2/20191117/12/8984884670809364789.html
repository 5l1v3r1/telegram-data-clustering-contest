      <p>Jason Dyer was parked on a remote dirt road near an abandoned, boarded-up cabin — out of danger, he thought — when the wind suddenly shifted. The state fire captain eyed the darkening sky from his SUV and gripped his radio.</p>
      <p>Moments earlier, he’d been on a routine assignment at the Kincade Fire as it burned fast through the rugged northeast corner of Sonoma County. But now the wind, driving toward the ocean, was gusting over the Mayacamas Mountains. It funneled up a nearby drainage, pushing flames ahead of it.</p>

      <p>The fire arrived fast, all around him, leaving him little time to react. Alone, trapped on the dirt road, he was in grave danger. The Cal Fire veteran realized he soon might have no choice but to mount a last-gasp effort to survive.</p>
      <p>It would mean setting small fires to burn as much of the land around him as possible, creating a buffer from the oncoming blaze. Then, if need be, he’d crawl under his blanket-like personal fire shelter, hoping to escape disfiguring burns and possibly death.</p>
      <p>But even as he plotted those moves, the situation grew more complicated. On this nowhere dirt road northeast of Geyserville, a pickup truck emerged out of the dust and smoke. Two other men fleeing the flames hopped out.</p>
      <p>Now there were three people pinned in by the fire, their possible last resort a fire-resistant sheet roughly the size of a large beach towel.</p>
      <p>Dyer had to act fast.</p>

      <p>The day had been routine up until then. By the time Dyer reached the cabin, at 3:45 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 25, the Kincade Fire had been burning for two days since sparking near a Pacific Gas and Electric Co. electrical tower. Dyer, 37, summoned from the state’s Butte County division, was assigned to lead Cal Fire’s Division Bravo.</p>
      <h3>About this story</h3>
      <p>This account of a Cal Fire captain and two other men surviving the Kincade Fire was based on a state investigative report into the incident and an interview with Capt. Jason Dyer, who agreed to talk after the report was released.</p>
      <p>He had spent the early morning hours scouting the fire zone, making sure he knew where he could safely send engines and bulldozers.</p>
      <p>Then he got word of a crew of firefighters who had shed their fire-resistant Nomex jackets, trying to stay cool in the afternoon heat. He’d driven off to find them and ended up at the old cabin on Circle 8 Lane.</p>
      <p>But now the Kincade Fire, which would ultimately destroy 174 homes north of Santa Rosa, was kicking up. The blaze was erratic, with wind-blown embers constantly igniting new spot fires. Dyer steered his Ford Expedition toward Pine Flat Road, his escape route down the mountain. He made it 200 feet before he had to stop.</p>
      <p>Flames were raging in the tree canopy and blasting across Circle 8 Lane. Surrounded by fire, he was forced to back up. His stomach twisted.</p>
      <p>Dyer, the son of a former Cal Fire battalion chief, had battled fires across the state. He liked the challenge of containing a blaze before it could destroy a community. A resident of Paradise, the Butte County town all but obliterated by last year’s historic Camp Fire, he knew what was at stake each time he went out.</p>
      <p>He was stoic, not easily frightened. But for him, this situation was different.</p>
      <p>Ahead, beyond the flames, the dirt stretch of Circle 8 Lane cut through a valley, looping past a domed rock, then crested a small hill to Pine Flat Road. If he could reach the pavement, he thought, he’d be OK. But he couldn’t.</p>

      <p>Earlier, a bulldozer driver had deemed the old cabin worth saving and ringed it with plowed earth. Staying near the structure now seemed to be Dyer’s only hope.</p>
      <p>Fire zipped along the dozer line, flames shooting up 60 feet. At 3:56 p.m., Dyer radioed his agency’s helicopter coordinator and declared an immediate life threat. But he realized a helicopter couldn’t spot him through the dense smoke.</p>
      <p>So he grabbed his personal fire shelter and placed it at the ready on the center console of the sport utility vehicle.</p>
      <p>Made of heat-reflecting layers of aluminum foil, woven silica and fiberglass, fire shelters act as protective blankets. Once inside it, he’d have a small pocket of breathable air. It’s small, designed for an individual: 86 inches long, 31 inches wide. If conditions got worse and flames blew across his position, he’d be ready to shake it out of its shoebox-size container and cover himself.</p>
      <p>The helicopter coordinator called back and told Dyer to stay put. Fire was threatening homes on Pine Flat Road. There was no path of escape. Dyer parked alongside the cabin, his hands trembling on the steering wheel.</p>
      <p>He said a prayer: <i>God help me.</i></p>

      <p>Most firefighters go their entire careers without deploying their fire shelter. And until that moment, Dyer hadn’t either. Not even during last year’s massive Camp Fire, when he had to lead a caravan of residents in vehicles through flames to the safety of a mowed field.</p>
      <p>He spent 17 days in that fire zone in his hometown. His wife was eight months pregnant at the time. He didn’t know right away that she had made it out with their four children and their dog, or that their home had been one of the few in Paradise to survive.</p>
      <p>Somehow they’d all made it through. But now he wondered if he’d be that lucky again.</p>
      <p>Worried that staying inside the SUV wouldn’t provide enough protection, Dyer tried to ram his way into the old cabin, but the door was bolted shut. So he grabbed a fusee, a flare that drips flaming fuel. It was time for Plan B.</p>
      <p>Using the flare, he started another burn to spread uphill and meet the wildfire. It would remove flammable brush and create a bigger circle of blackened, defensible space around the cabin. The new flames spread quickly, the wind eddied, and Dyer worried he might actually pull fire toward him. When heated air rises, flames can intensify as cooler air rushes in. But his backfire held.</p>
      <p>Just then, a gray Ford Ranger speckled with mud pulled up on Circle 8 Lane. Two men who had defied orders to evacuate were finally fleeing.</p>
      <p>“What are you doing?” Dyer hollered at them. “You’re cut off. You can’t keep going forward.”</p>
      <p>Now there were three men surrounded by flames, with a shelter designed to protect only one. The fire grew louder, roaring like a jet engine. The heat was nearly unbearable.</p>
      <p>Dyer tossed his extra flares far from his SUV, so it wouldn’t catch fire. Get down in front of the vehicle, he told the men, away from direct flame.</p>
      <p>There was no alternative. He unfurled the shelter.</p>

      <p>Squeezed together under the silver sheet, the three faced each other in a tight triangle, squatting like baseball catchers. Elbows resting against knees, heads together, tucked down. Fortunately, none was taller than 5-foot-7.</p>
      <p>The fire raged nearby. Smoke stung their eyes. Burning embers blew in under the shelter. They tried to seal it to the ground, pressing its edges into the dirt with their palms. But as soon as one side was sealed, the other would pop up.</p>
      <p>They couldn’t see anything. Only the popping sound of flaming pine needles and torched trees signaled the Kincade Fire’s relentless approach. Occasionally, Dyer peeked out of the shelter.</p>
      <p>“As bad as it gets, it’ll be worse out there,” he told the other men. “Whatever you do, don’t leave. Don’t let it blow out of your hands.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>His mind drifted to his family. He pictured his daughter and four sons without a father, and Mikalia, his wife of 15 years, without a husband. In the darkness, he couldn’t see his left hand, the one with an “M” tattooed on the ring finger after he lost too many wedding bands.</p>
      <p>He thought about 10-month-old Lochlan, the first baby born in Paradise after the Camp Fire, who was learning to walk. About his oldest son, 15, who was just learning to drive, jerkily steering the family truck from the house Dyer built himself across their 6 acres. And his 12-year-old boy, the one with dreams of becoming a firefighter like his father and grandfather.</p>

      <p>The old cabin with the peeling paint began to burn. Dyer saw it when he poked his head from beneath the fire shelter. The men had to move away from it.</p>
      <p>So, still crouching and pressing the edges of the shelter to the ground, the three men duckwalked together, waddling farther down the plowed dozer line. One inhale of superheated gas could be deadly, Dyer knew.</p>
      <p>The two men he was trying to save didn’t talk much, but somehow their presence was calming. Responsibility distracts, and Dyer focused on them. Ten long minutes passed and, finally, so did the flames. Knowing Dyer was in the area, four helicopters dumped 16 loads of water on the fire.</p>
      <p>Some of it trickled down the sides of the shelter. Cautiously, the men peeled it off, incredulous. None of them was injured. Their vehicles were only singed.</p>
      <p>At 4:42 p.m., a line of firefighting vehicles arrived on Circle 8 Lane, and Dyer and his fellow survivors were driven to the safety of Pine Flat Road. Before each was loaded into a separate ambulance, Dyer shook the men’s hands. He didn’t know what to say.</p>
      <p>Checking his phone, he found a text from his wife: “I hope you’re okay.”</p>

      <p>Normally, Mikalia didn’t send texts like that. But wandering around Chico Mall that afternoon, waiting for one of their sons’ jujitsu lessons to end, she’d been talking to her daughter about her father, and decided she’d utter a quick prayer and then text him to make sure he was all right. It was 4:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>Through the window of the ambulance, Dyer watched black smoke rise over Sonoma County. He took a deep breath and realized: He never learned the other men’s names.</p>
