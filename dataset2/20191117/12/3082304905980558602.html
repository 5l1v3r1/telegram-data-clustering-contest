      <p>“He (Pogba) said it himself,” the Norwegian said, as he addressed a press conference ahead of the ongoing international break.</p>
      <p>“It won’t be too long until he’s out of his cast. He’ll work hard during the international break and hopefully, he’ll be back.”</p>
      <p>The midfielder posted videos of his fitness camp via his <i>Instagram Stories</i>, which can be viewed right <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/paulpogba/"><i>here</i></a>.</p>
