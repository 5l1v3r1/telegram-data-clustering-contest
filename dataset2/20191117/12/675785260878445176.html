      <h1>The Apprentice star in Twitter row with Alan Sugar over his 'horrific' tattoos</h1>
      <h2>Lewis Ellis put his tattoos on full display during this week's episode as part of a challenge, and after Lord Sugar tweeted his disapproval, Lewis has 'received lots of nasty DMs'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:47:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>It seems Apprentice supremo Lord Alan Sugar is far from sweet on tattoos.</p>
      <p>The Amstrad bigwig made an online attack on contestant Lewis Ellis after he saw the hopeful’s inked torso on last week’s episode.</p>
      <p>Lord Sugar – previously accused of a racist tweet – branded the wannabe “horrific” and said he’d be “embarrassed” in future.</p>
      <p>The jibe didn’t go down well with digital marketing manager Lewis, who was hurt by the outburst.</p>
      <p>“Lewis tattoos are horrific,” Lord Sugar, 72, vented to fans.</p>
      <p>“Tell me where I am missing the point. What does he look like?”</p>

      <p>Lancashire-born Lewis, 28, replied: “Wowwww LAS how could you do me like this.”</p>
      <p>But the budding entrepreneur –who is still in the competition vying for £250,000 of investment – wasn’t going to let the dig keep him down, as he hit back defiantly.</p>
      <p>“Back to rule #1 f**k what people think about you!” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“Thank you everyone that took the time to show some support for my ‘horrific’ tattoos and pointing out no one has the right to judge you or your body.”</p>

      <p>Refusing to let it go, Lord Sugar couldn’t resist throwing in some more insults.</p>
      <p>“Lewis your tattoos tell your story. What are you a Kindle.</p>
      <p>“You have the right to do what you want to your body. I have the right of an opinion.</p>
      <p>"I say they are horrible. When you’re 50 on the beach you’ll wear a T shirt. You will be an embarrassment to your kids.”</p>
      <p>Does that hurt as much as the tattoo did, Lewis?</p>
