      <p>TIRUNELVELI</p>
      <p>The AIADMK candidate’s resounding victory in Nanguneri by-poll has invigorated the spirits of the ruling party cadre here as they flooded the party offices here with their supporters to express their willingness to contest the local body elections by formally submitting applications.</p>
      <p>Ever since the submission of applications for contesting the election for various posts in the local bodies – right from the Tirunelveli Corporation Mayor to the village panchayat president – started a few days ago, the number of applications being submitted in the ruling AIADMK camp is huge. Most of the aspirants, in a bid to show their strength and popularity to their senior office-bearers like district secretaries here, they bring their supporters in vans fluttering with party flags and submit their applications amidst huge sloganeering hailing late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.</p>
      <p>The party office-bearers here attribute this revival after Lok Sabha polls debacle to the party candidate Reddiyarpatti V. Narayanan’s resounding victory with 34,000 margin in the recently concluded Nanguneri by-election.</p>
      <p>“We received 735 applications on Friday and another 700-odd applications on Saturday till 6.45 p.m. to take the tally to over 1,450 in just two days. The resounding victory we could ensure in the Nanguneri by-poll has phenomenally strengthened the party cadres’ hopes and motivated them to test their electoral fortunes in the local body elections also,” says Rajya Sahba MP Vijila Sathyananth, who has also submitted her application for the post of Tirunelveli Mayor.</p>
      <p>Apart from Ms. Vijila, for the coveted post of Tirunelveli Mayor, 18 applications have been received so far from the aspirants that include former Mayor Bhuvaneshwari and physician Abarubha Sunandhini, who was hand picked by late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa as AIADMK’s candidate for Tirunelveli Mayor when the civic polls were notified last.</p>
      <p>As the election was not held, she, who resigned her government job to contest the election, could not test her electoral fortune.</p>
      <p>Moreover, former Deputy Mayor P. Jeganathan alias Ganesan and former Manur union chairman ‘Kallur’ Velayutham, who returned to the AIADMK after being with T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam for a while, also submitted their applications as the reservation for Tirunelveli Mayor post is yet to be announced.</p>
      <p>“While 18 applications have been received for the Mayor post, 167 applications have been submitted for the post of 55 councillors,” says Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja, AIADMK’s Tirunelveli city district secretary.</p>
      <p>Though former Mayor Jayarani could be seen moving around in the party office even as the applications for the Mayor post were being submitted on the last day on Saturday, she did not file her application. Former Sankarankovil MLA Muthuselvi expressed her desire to contest for the post of Sankarankovil municipal chairman.</p>
      <p>In DMK, wives of two former DMK councillors – S.V. Suresh and V. Ponniah – submitted their applications for the Mayor post and former councillor Rajakumari of ward 27 is also likely to submit her application.</p>
      <p>However, no civic-poll related development could be noticed in the Congress, which has just passed a resolution saying that the Tirunelveli Mayor post should be allotted to the candidate to be fielded by the national party.</p>
