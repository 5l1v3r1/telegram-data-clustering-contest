      <h1>I'm A Celebrity SPOILERS: Nadine Coyle 'in tears' over 10,000ft skydive challenge</h1>
      <h2>Caitlyn Jenner apparently has to comfort her...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:28:56+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Dimery</a></address>
      <p>If anyone thought the producers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> might go easy on the contestants this year, it looks like they were very much mistaken.</p>
      <p>The new series starts on ITV tonight, and according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10360193/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-breaks-down-tears-terrifying-skydive/">The Sun Online</a><b>,</b> the celebs are given terrifying tasks right from the off.</p>
      <p>Former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner are faced with doing a parachute jump from 10,000 feet.</p>
      <p>And the website's report says that Nadine is seen breaking down in tears as she prepares for the ordeal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Nadine, 34, and Caitlyn, 70, are reportedly asked to do the parachute drop in order to retrieve keys that will unlock two Pontoons, each containing five coloured tokens.</p>
      <p>At the same time, two of their fellow contestants, rugby player James Haskell and former Big Brother star Adele Roberts, canoe to the Pontoons to await delivery of the keys.</p>
      <p>However, according to The Sun Online's news story, the thought of leaping out of a plane proves too much for Nadine, who can't hold back her tears.</p>

      <p>Retired decathlete Caitlyn is apparently seen comforting the singer.</p>
      <p>And apparently, Nadine and Caitlyn aren't the only ones who are faced with a vertigo-inducing task tonight.</p>
      <p>Roman Kemp, Ian Wright, Kate Garraway, Andrew Maxwell, Myles Stephenson and Jacqueline Jossa are seen heading to the top of the 334-foot Focus Building at Surfers Paradise to undertake the notorious Plank challenge.</p>

      <p>In scenes that are sure to have viewers biting their nails, the celebs must traverse steel girders only a foot-wide, with huge drops beneath them.</p>
      <p>Even though they are wearing safety harnesses, it must be a truly terrifying experience.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, they all manage to return to the ground safely – but no doubt there will be plenty more scary tasks around the corner.</p>
      <p>Earlier on in tonight's programme, viewers will apparently see the celebs arrive for the new series in style.</p>
      <p>Some arrive by speedboat, with others rocking up in expensive supercars, before the fun begins...</p>
