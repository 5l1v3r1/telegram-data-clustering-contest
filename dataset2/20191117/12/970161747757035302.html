        <b>James Arthur has announced his decision to quit Twitter after being bombarded with ‘hurtful’ comments from trolls.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Say You Won’t Let Go singer revealed that he’s reached his limit with reading nasty messages on the social media platform and will no longer be posting tweets himself, instead leaving his team to run his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>Announcing the news on Sunday, James said: ‘Have to be honest some of the things I read on here go a bit toot far and quite frankly fuckin hurt, if that was your goal you win Maybe I should have thicker skin at this point I don’t know but either way this is my last tweet, I’m loggin off. Peace out Twitter friends [sic].’</p>
      <p>He then added: ‘All posts will be done by digital team moving forward. Thanks for all the love and support shown by fans on this platform over the years it’s been emotional but I’ve gotta delete this app. Much love and respect JA.’</p>

      <p>James, 31, was flooded with messages of support from fans who encouraged him to ignore the trolls but said they understood his need to focus on his mental health.</p>
      <p>One supportive fan said: ‘They do go too far. I’m sorry they hurt you.. and us fans, too. Sometimes we need to focus only on the good, ignore a lot, and sometimes fight back, too. And sometimes we have to take a step back, and come back stronger. See you when you’re ready. Love you forever, James.’</p>
      <p>Another stated: ‘Don’t let them win they are just jealous of your success,’ before pleading: ‘Don’t leave us.’</p>

      <p>One other fan tweeted: ‘Waking up to this makes me sad and angry. They take something away from all of us that was so important for us. We love/loved to get in contact with you this way. This is not fair but I understand you. We will always love and support you.’</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/james-arthur-says-logan-paul-robbed-fair-fight-ksi-triumphs-boxing-rematch-11073690/">James clashed with KSI fans after showing support for Logan Paul</a> ahead of the YouTube stars’ boxing fight last weekend.</p>
      <p>Hitting back at his critics amid the backlash, James said: ‘I just sold out 2 tours and had the biggest record in the country about a week ago, just coz KS3 didn’t do a vlog about it doesn’t mean it’s not “relevant”. I hate you kids today.’</p>
      <p>The Rewrite The Stars singer has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/02/james-arthur-recalls-triggering-panic-attacks-after-smoking-an-ungodly-amount-of-weed-8100127/">always been open about his mental health battle and told Metro.co.uk</a> of his panic attack earlier this year: ‘I feel very equipped to deal with it now. Once upon a time I had no idea what was going on, I was having several panic attacks a day.</p>

      <p>‘Turns out I was smoking on an ungodly amount of weed, eating badly. ‘I was setting off triggers and didn’t even know what triggers were. Everyday I wake up, I have to be aware of it. I guess it’s like addiction, if you’ve got alcoholism you have to keep an eye on your drinking.’</p>
      <p>Sharing advice for others battling with their mental health, James added: ‘Speaking about it really is the best medicine. For anyone who’s going through it, if you could just muster up enough courage to say I’m struggling, that first step could be the biggest one.’</p>
      <p>It’s otherwise been a great month for James, who released his third album You in October reaching number two on the UK charts.</p>
