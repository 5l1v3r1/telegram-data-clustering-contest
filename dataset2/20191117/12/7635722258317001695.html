      <h1>Two Dublin Bus routes to begin 24-hour services from next month</h1>

        <b>Two Dublin Bus routes are set to become 24-hour services from next month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 41 and 15 routes will operate on an around-the-clock basis from December 1 in the city.</p>
      <p>The 41 runs from the city centre to the airport and onwards to Swords, while the 15 runs from Ballycullen Road through the city centre and on to Clongriffin.</p>
      <p>Up until now, these services have run from early morning to late evening.</p>
      <p>From next month, the frequency of buses will improve during the day and will also run every 30 minutes throughout the night from midnight to 5am.</p>
      <p>The fare for passengers travelling during the day or at night will remain the same.</p>
      <p>NTA CEO Anne Graham said the two new 24-hour routes indicates "a public transport service that reflects the changing city”.</p>
      <p>She said: “The manner in which Dublin functions as a city has shifted gradually but dramatically in recent years. It is no longer the case that city shuts down at 11 or 12 at night.</p>
      <blockquote>“The patterns of work and socialising have changed. For instance, the success in attracting to the city, major employers who are headquartered many time-zones away, serving markets around the world, means that commercial and economic activity in Dublin continues around the clock."</blockquote>
      <p>Dublin Bus CEO Ray Coyne said: “These services will help unlock the full potential of Dublin’s vibrant and growing night-time economy while also providing early morning journeys into the city centre for our commuters, further assisting in the fight against congestion.”</p>
      <p>Business group Dublin Chamber welcomed the announcement, saying it was “an early Christmas present for the city”.</p>
      <p>The Chamber's Head of Communications Graeme McQueen said: "Demand has been there for some time for a 24-hour bus service between the city centre and Dublin Airport. This is a small but important step forward for the city.</p>
      <blockquote>The way people access and move around the city is changing considerably and it’s important that our transport providers respond to demand.</blockquote>
      <p>He continued: "It’s encouraging to see that the normal fare structure will also apply to these new 24-hour services. If these two new routes prove successful, then there is scope for the addition of more 24-hour services in the city."</p>
