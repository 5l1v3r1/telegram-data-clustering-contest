      <p><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/katy-perry">Katy Perry</a> spread her magic in the country recently by performing at the One Plus Music Festival in Mumbai. As Katy met with Jacqueline Fernandez at the One Plus press conference, Fernandez recently found a new friend in International pop star Katy Perry. Hitting off on the right notes, Jackie and Katy share mutual admiration for each other and last evening, as Katy was performing at the music festival- she gave a special tribute to her girlfriend which is proof enough of the love she has for our very own ‘Jacq of hearts’.<br/><br/>Katy, while setting the stage on fire with her pop numbers gave a big shout out to Jacqueline and said, “Jacqueline you look good in that dress” which was followed by her hit list of songs! Upon the first meet, Jackie was delighted to accompany the singer who said she wanted to watch Kick on her first evening in Mumbai. Jacqueline truly was a great friend to Katy throughout her trip to India. From sharing giggles together to attending the concert, parties, and movies- the girl pals were the BFF goals that we loved to see!
