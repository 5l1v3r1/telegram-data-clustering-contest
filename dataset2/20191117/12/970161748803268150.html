      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> has given fans an amazing glimpse to her decades-long friendship with RuPaul with an epic throwback.</p>
      <p>The Strictly star wasn’t about to just let her bestie’s birthday pass her by, and so took the opportunity to share a cute moment of them from a cowboy hat.</p>
      <p>In a photo dated around the 90s (we’re guessing because of that epic Ginger Spice-style red and blonde hairdo Michelle’s sporting), the pair are still beaming as big as ever.</p>
      <p>She wrote next to the photo: ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my ride or die. This world is a better place because of your love and wisdom. Every day I thank God for you.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you for all that you have done, for all that you continue to do and for what’s to come. You are magical, Ru and I couldn’t possibly love you more.’</p>

      <p>The pair have been pioneers of the LGBTQIA+ movements over the past 20 years together, bringing drag to the mainstream thanks to RuPaul’s Drag Race.</p>
      <p>Hey, Ru’s not called Supermodel of the World for nothing!</p>

      <p>Turning 59 today, the pair have been working harder than ever as they launch a celebrity version of the series, announcing a second UK series as well as a new All-Star and regular series.</p>
      <p>Michelle even paid homage to her community with a performance to Vogue by Madonna on Strictly Come Dancing during the Blackpool special on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Letting her body ‘move to the music’, the star put on her fiercest poses while dressed in a French Revolution style dress alongside Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>Results are due to air tonight, with all seven remaining contestants relying on votes in order to keep themselves in the race.</p>
