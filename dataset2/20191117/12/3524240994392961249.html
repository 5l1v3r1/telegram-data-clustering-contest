      </p>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission is yet to commence the formal collation of results of the Bayelsa State governorship election conducted on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The exercise was scheduled by the commission to start at 10.00 a.m. Sunday morning at the Prof. Mahmood Yakubu Media Centre.</p>
      <p>The commission’s Head, Voter Education and Publicity, Wilfred Ifogah, had on Saturday night circulated information that the collation would begin at 10.00 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, more than one hour after the slated time, the collation of the poll results is yet to commence.</p>
      <p>Accredited journalists, election observers and party agents had been waiting for officials of INEC to begin the exercise.</p>
      <p>There is heavy security presence within and outside the commission’s office located along the Swali Market Road in Yenagoa.</p>
