      <h1>Roberto Firmino opens up on life as Liverpool's chief playmaker under Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <h2>The Reds' No.9 has been at his sparkling best at times this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:24:50+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/elliott-jackson/" target="_blank">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool star Roberto Firmino has lifted the lid on his important role under Jurgen Klopp and how he has adapted to the position upfront.</p>
      <p>The Reds' No.9 has established himself as one of the best strikers in Europe over the last 18 months and has continued to go from strength to strength in the Premier League this season, helping the Reds to 11 wins from 12 this term.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fans-fears-banished-jurgen-17236440">is seen as an integral cog</a> alongside Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, with the fearsome trio netting 181 times between them in their time together at Anfield.</p>
      <p>While he may not hit the goal-scoring heights of Sergio Aguero or Harry Kane, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/roberto-firmino">Firmino's</a> talents at linking up the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> attack don't go unnoticed.</p>

      <p>Firmino, who joined from Hoffenheim for around £29million in the summer of 2015, initially started out as an attacking midfielder at Anfield before being converted into a striker when Klopp moved to Merseyside later that year.</p>
      <p>His ability to knit play together, similarly, brings out the best in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sadio-mane">Mane</a> and Salah, who have been in the goals again this term with nine goals apiece. </p>
      <p>Speaking to Premier League Productions, Firmino said of his eight assists this campaign: “That is just me, my personality, to try to be a good and humble guy.</p>

      <p>“To try to help my team in the best way with assists and goals. I like that, I like to win all the time, and for that I will always be like this.</p>
      <p>“I am a guy who respects my position on the pitch. Where the team needs me, I will play. As a No.9, but sometimes I play as a No.10, and I try to give my best.</p>
      <p>“As I mentioned before, I always want to help my team as best as I can and to always be chasing the win, always winning games. That is what matters the most."</p>
