      <h1>Lil Jon Detained In Vietnam Over $400K Worth Of Jewelry</h1>

      <p>Vietnam – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50159/title.interview-lil-jon-has-become-a-master-of-selling-in">Lil Jon</a> had too much bling for his own good during his travels in Vietnam on Friday (November 15).</p>
      <p>The King Of Crunk revealed he was detained for hours at Tan Son Nhat Int’l Airport due to not properly declaring his expensive jewelry. As a result, the United States Embassy had to get involved to help him leave the country.</p>
      <p>“I was detained for about six hours because of my jewelry, which was also temporarily seized,” he said in a statement to <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/lil-jon-detained-vietnam-jewelry/">XXL</a>. “I was not aware that, when arriving, you have to declare any jewelry [gold, diamonds, rubies, etc.] that exceeds $12,000 US dollars… and the jewelry I had with me was worth over $400,000.</p>
      <p>“Immediately I told someone traveling with me to call the U.S. Embassy when it started to look like I wouldn’t be able to leave the country until the situation was resolved. U.S. Embassy reps came to the airport and we had a formal meeting with myself, them, and representatives from the Vietnamese government.”</p>

      <p>The situation was eventually resolved, allowing Jon to travel to his scheduled gig in Macau.</p>
      <p>“They agreed to let me go with a warning in good faith between the Vietnamese government and the U.S. government,” he noted. “After it was resolved, I caught the next flight to Macau for my show [that night] for the F1 Rac.</p>
      <p>“I really wanna thank the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam again. It’s amazin’ to know that no matter where I travel in the world, if something happens…the U.S. Embassy’s got their citizens’ back! I’m super grateful to them.”</p>
