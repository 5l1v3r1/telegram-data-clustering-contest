      <p>Speaking to The Sun, she said: “I know Boris, yeah. I haven’t seen him since he’s been Prime Minister.”</p>
      <p>Toffolo said she feared for her friendship with Stanley Johnson, and thought he could be silenced on social media due to his son being Prime Minister, but her fears were soon allayed.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was a bit worried that there would be a ‘before’ Boris was PM and ‘after’ chapter of our friendship, and when we were on the run.”</p>
