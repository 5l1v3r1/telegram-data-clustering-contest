      <h1>Euro 2020 permutations: How do things stand in all qualifying groups?</h1>

        <b>The Euro 2020 qualifying and play-off picture will be set in stone over the next week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Four places remain up for grabs in the final round of Euro 2020 qualifying fixtures.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency looks at which teams have secured their places, who can still join them and who is on course for the play-offs.</p>
      <h3>Group A</h3>
      <p>England have won the group, with the Czech Republic confirmed in second. Kosovo will go into the play-offs as a Nations League D group winner, as will Bulgaria due to the League C rankings - though they could yet move into a higher tier.</p>
      <h3>Group B</h3>
      <p>Serbia and Portugal will battle for the second qualifying place - Serbia host confirmed group winners Ukraine on Sunday afternoon, with Portugal away at Luxembourg. There is a play-off safety net for whichever team misses out.</p>
      <h3>Group C</h3>
      <p>Holland's head-to-head advantage over Northern Ireland sees them qualify alongside Germany. Northern Ireland and Belarus will enter the play-offs, but the former could yet move up to a higher tier depending on results in groups D and E.</p>
      <h3>Group D</h3>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland need to beat Denmark on Monday to beat them to a qualifying spot. The only way both teams could qualify is in the unlikely event Switzerland lose to Gibraltar. Again, the odd team out will go forward to the play-offs along with Georgia.</p>
      <h3>Group E</h3>
      <p>Croatia have qualified, with Wales needing to beat Hungary to pip them to second place. The loser has a play-off safety net and Slovakia will also be involved at that stage.</p>
      <h3>Group F</h3>
      <p>Spain top the group and Sweden have qualified, with Romania and Norway heading to the play-offs.</p>
      <h3>Group G</h3>
      <p>Poland, with head-to-head advantage over fellow qualifiers Austria, are confirmed as group winners. North Macedonia and Israel are in the play-offs.</p>
      <h3>Group H</h3>
      <p>France and Turkey have qualified. Iceland will be in the play-offs despite finishing the Nations League as League A's lowest-ranked team - nine of the 11 above them have already qualified automatically, with Switzerland and Portugal likely to follow.</p>
      <h3>Group I</h3>
      <p>Belgium win the group, Russia have also qualified and Scotland will host a League C play-off tie.</p>
      <h3>Group J</h3>
      <p>Italy, as group winners, and Finland have qualified. Bosnia and Herzegovina will head to the play-offs.</p>
      <h3>Play-offs</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The four group winners from each tier of the Nations League have the fall-back of a play-off spot.</p>
      <p>Should they qualify automatically, the place will pass on to the next highest-ranked team from that level or, if there are not enough available to fill both play-off semi-finals, a team from a lower tier.</p>
      <p>Iceland are the only team certain to play in Nations League A's play-off path in March, with the remainder to come from lower tiers unless Switzerland or Portugal suffer hugely unlikely defeats.</p>
      <p>Bosnia will play in Path B and Scotland and Norway in Path C, with Wales, Slovakia, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Bulgaria, Israel and Romania all involved but their respective paths to be determined by results from Sunday to Tuesday and, if necessary, a draw.</p>
      <p>Only Path D is set in stone, with Georgia hosting Belarus and North Macedonia taking on Kosovo.</p>
