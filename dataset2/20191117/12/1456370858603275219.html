      <h1>Funniest/Most Insightful Comments Of The Week At Techdirt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/leigh" target="_blank">Leigh Beadon</a></address>
      <p>This week, our first place winner on the insightful side is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/toom1275">Toom1275</a> with a response to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191113/12503243383/universal-music-claims-copyright-over-newly-public-domain-yes-we-have-no-bananas.shtml#c20">Universal Music's copyright claim over a public domain song</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>And this is the kind of thing that is accurately described by the term "copyright theft" - using copyright as an excuse to steal the work of others.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In second place, it's <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/thad">Thad</a> with a simple response to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191108/23524343352/giant-publisher-macmillan-goes-to-war-against-libraries.shtml#c197">Macmillan's war on libraries</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Pirates, as always, are unaffected.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For editor's choice on the insightful side, we start out with an anonymous comment that delivered an important <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191108/23524343352/giant-publisher-macmillan-goes-to-war-against-libraries.shtml#c154">update to the Macmillan story</a>:</p>
      <blockquote><b>KCLS boycotts Macmillan Publishers’ eBook embargo<br/></b><br/>KCLS is the King County, Washington Library System. It has 50 libraries and serves more than one million residents. <br/><br/><a href="https://kcls.org/news/kcls-boycotts-macmillan-publishers-ebook-embargo/">KCLS boycotts Macmillan Publishers’ eBook embargo<br/></a><br/>Effective November 1, 2019, the King County Library System (KCLS) will no longer purchase newly released eBooks from Macmillan Publishers . . . <br/><br/><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rtfmMwvGaTSXRPYn8">King County</a> in Washington state, includes a large portion the Seattle metro area. KCLS is, however, a separate system from the Seattle Public Library (SPL). Nevertheless, KCLS is one of the busiest public library systems in the U.S., and <a href="https://d4804za1f1gw.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2019/04/29095026/KCLS-Year-In-Review-Highlights-2018.pdf">in 2018</a>— <br/><br/>For the fifth year in a row, KCLS was named the top digital circulating public library system in the country, with 4.8 million checkouts of eBook and audiobook downloads– a 23 percent increase over 2017.</blockquote>
      <p>Next, we've got <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/bloof">Bloof</a> responding to the latest failed attempt at <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191110/13531143357/court-to-racist-douchebags-not-defamatory-newspaper-to-call-you-racist-douchebags.shtml#c56">suing for defamation over being called a racist</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Well, if there's one thing we all know by now it's that filing and losing a lawsuit over being called a racist is a surefire way to get people to stop calling you one, and surely isn't going to get the fact you're known for being a racist douchebag repeated across the internet until the end of time. <br/><br/>Seriously though, if you don't want to be called a racist douchebag, stop being racist douchebags. It's not hard, the vast majority of humanity manage to live their lives without making monkey noises and smashing watermelons to taunt African Americans.</blockquote>
      <p>Over on the funny side, our first place winner is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/regularstone">Stephen T. Stone</a> responding to that same lawsuit, and specifically to the argument that the behavior wasn't racist, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191110/13531143357/court-to-racist-douchebags-not-defamatory-newspaper-to-call-you-racist-douchebags.shtml#c15">it was a reference to the movie <i>Castaway</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>This is so much of a reach that it could be one of Dhalsim’s moves in a Street Fighter game.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In second place, it's an anonymous response to various silly proposals about <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191108/23524343352/giant-publisher-macmillan-goes-to-war-against-libraries.shtml?threaded=false#c254">hobbling libraries' use of digital materials to preserve some "original purpose"</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The purpose of libraries is not to cut down trees and store paper. It is to store stone and clay tablets. <br/><br/>STOP INNOVATING TOO QUICKLY</blockquote>
      <p>For editor's choice on the funny side, we start out with an anonymous response to the notion that Universal Music's takedown of public domain material is okay because <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191113/12503243383/universal-music-claims-copyright-over-newly-public-domain-yes-we-have-no-bananas.shtml#c271">the notice only says it "may" contain unauthorized material</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>It also "may" have turned him into a newt.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And finally, we've got <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/regularstone">Stephen T. Stone</a> with a response to someone who suggested Twitter aim to filter out <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191111/15432943364/twitter-instagram-both-begin-experiments-decreasing-more-socially-questionable-incentives-their-platforms.shtml#c36">"someone who cannot read, write, speak in complete sentences, or express coherent thoughts"</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>How dare you suggest Twitter do something about @dril.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That's all for this week, folks!</p>
