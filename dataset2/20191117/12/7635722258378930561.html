      <h1>Speculation mounts over Lisa Smith's return to Ireland next week</h1>

        <b>There is speculation that Irish woman Lisa Smith could be returned to Ireland as early as next Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dundalk woman left three years ago to join the so-called Islamic State group in Syria.</p>
      <p>She is currently being held in a camp on the Turkish/Syrian border with her two-year-old child.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the Turkish foreign minister was quoted as saying that two Irish people are to be deported, along with more than 20 other Europeans.</p>
      <p>There is now speculation that this may take place as a soon as Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Susan Keogh on <i>Newstalk Breakfast</i>, journalist Norma Costello said when Smith returns will depend on how long it takes Turkish security forces to question her.</p>
      <p>She said that Turkey can be "a bit of wild car in terms of diplomacy" and highlighted the fact that Smith is in a sovereign state that Ireland has no jurisdiction over.</p>
      <p>Ms Costello said: "It doesn't matter what plans are laid in Dublin, Ankara could choose to change that in a minute."</p>
      <h3>Garda investigation</h3>
      <p>She said there are questions over what Smith did in Syria, but gardaí have been looking at her for a long time.</p>
      <p>She said that they began their investigations into the former Defence Forces member a year before she went to ISIS territory.</p>
      <p>Ms Costello said: "The information gardaí have on her, it's not vapour, they have been gathering evidence on Lisa for several years.</p>
      <p>"That's an imperative thing to understand because the evidence in Syria is so sparce and something that could be easily challenged in an Irish court.</p>
      <blockquote>"The fact that they might have evidence they ascertained in Ireland changes the whole picture for her.</blockquote>
      <p>Ms Costello, who has been extensively covering Smith's story in the Middle East, said that the likelihood that she will be arrested upon her return is "high", but whether charges will be successfully brought is not as clear.</p>
      <h3>People 'furious and scared'</h3>
      <p>She said the issue was a "political football" and it would be damaging for a politician to sign-off on Smith's repatriation only for the prosecution against her to fail.</p>
      <p>"There's an awful lot of impetus to get Lisa home, get her arrested and then try and get a charge against her," she said.</p>
      <p>The freelance journalist said that people in Smith's hometown of Dundalk were "furious and scared".</p>
      <p>Ms Costello also said she has been approached by the government for access to the information she has gathered on Smith.</p>
      <p>However, she said she would not be used as a "security source".</p>
      <p>"I'm a journalist...I'm not going to testify against her because that's not my responsibility," she said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it emerged this morning that Smith's family reportedly want her to tell her story on the Late Late Show when she returns.</p>
      <p>A family spokesperson told the <i>Irish Sunday Mirror</i> that Smith wants the opportunity to express her innocence in her own words.</p>
