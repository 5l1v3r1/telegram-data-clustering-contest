      <h1>Death of toddler at Glasgow super hospital probed by investigators</h1>
      <h2>A three-year-old boy died just weeks before 10-year-old Milly Main after it's believed she contracted a dirty water infection.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:15:52+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A probe has been launched into the death of a toddler who died at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/super-hospital-chiefs-bullying-whistleblower-20896930">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a>.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Fatalities Investigations Unit (SFIU) has opened an investigation after a three-year-old boy died inside the so-called ‘super hospital’ in August 2017.</p>
      <p>His death came just three weeks before 10-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">Milly Main</a> died after it's believed she contracted a dirty water infection.</p>
      <p>Her mum said that her little girl caught the lethal bug when she was in remission for cancer and was preparing her return to the family home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Crown Office told <a href="https://stv.tv/news/west-central/1442454-three-year-old-s-death-at-super-hospital-investigated/?fbclid=IwAR3h-cyc5L9AdKbA1DJQiCPZfQfS7OA1niCoI8iD-lnM9NYTJfI1o4sHP7o">STV</a> : “The Procurator Fiscal has received a report in connection with the death of a three-year-old boy at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on August 9, 2017.</p>
      <p>"The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit (SFIU), is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">number of other young people were reportedly infected by the water supply at the Glasgow hospital campus</a>, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC).</p>
      <p>One report released earlier this year had shown that 23 children with cancer had acquired infections linked to the water supply in two wards at RHC.</p>
      <p>The bacteria stenotrophomonas, which is found in water, was linked to 12 of the cases.</p>
      <p>However, as revealed by the Daily Record, a whistleblower approached Labour MSP <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/anas-sarwar">Anas Sarwar</a> and alleged that an internal doctor-led inquiry focusing on 2017 found another 26 cases.</p>
      <p>The MSP for Glasgow said the NHSGGC was ‘not longer fit for purpose’ and called for the health body to be put into “special measures”.</p>

      <p>He previously said: “The Glasgow health board has unforgivably let down patients and staff.</p>
      <p>“There are still dozens of families who don’t know the truth about infection contracted in the QUEH.</p>
      <p>“This only came to light following the brave actions of an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">NHS</a> whistleblower.</p>
      <p>“But rather than seek answers for patients and the public, the health board has resorted to attacking the whistleblower, threatening and intimidating them.</p>
      <p>“This is a clear attempt to silence staff from speaking out, and prevent the truth being heard by the public.</p>
      <p>“Who is signing off these insulting statements being issued by the health board and are they being cleared by the Health Secretary?</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government must now step in and put the health board into special measures, so that ministers take control, staff can speak out in confidence they will not lose their jobs, and – most importantly - parents can learn the truth.</p>
      <p>“ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432">NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde</a> is not fit for purpose.”</p>
