      <p>Cape Town - <b>Manchester City </b>are reportedly eyeing a move for Napoli's <b>Kalidou Koulibaly</b> and Inter Milan's<b> Milan Skrinier </b>in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>City are nine points behind the Reds as they fight to retain their title and issues in central defence have been a huge thorn in the side for Pep Guardiolaâ€™s men.</p>
      <p>The injury to Aymeric Laporte has had a huge impact on the City side and reports claim the Blues are lining up not one, but two central defenders when the transfer window opens again in January.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that City will get the cheque book out to sign Koulibaly and Skrinier in the new year.</p>
      <p>Koulibaly has emerged as one of the best central defenders in European football and it is no surprise that City are being linked with a swoop for the 28-year-old.</p>
      <p>He is also on the wanted list of arch rivals Manchester United, who tried and failed to sign him in the summer, as Napoli refused to cash in on their star defender.</p>
      <p>It was hoped that Koulibaly would help Napoli launch a push for the Serie A title this season, but they have struggled and are way behind Juventus and Napoli, who are scrapping it out for the Scudetto.</p>
      <p>That has added fuel to the fire that a move could happen, but it still remains to be seen if Napoli would cash in midway through the season.</p>
      <p>Koulibaly himself has suggested he is going nowhere when posting a tweet on Saturday confirming his commitment to Napoli.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Inter central defender Skriniar is also said to be a target, but again the Nerazzurri are unlikely to cash in during the January transfer window as they battle for silverware.</p>
      <p>City may have to wait until the end of the season for both players, but could still try their luck with offers early in the new year.</p>
