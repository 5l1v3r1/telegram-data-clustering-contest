        <i>Every week we’re introducing you to a brand new artist who we’re going mad for here at NME Towers via our ego-busting Q&amp;A, What’s Your Band Called, Mate? This week, New York four-piece Loose Buttons tell us about the unlikely cause of their inter-band “civil war”, belting out The Darkness in the karaoke booth and how they’re comparing themselves to a punk Larry David.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s your band called, mate?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We are simply called… Loose Buttons.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We are…</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eric (Vocals), Zack (Guitar), Manny (Bass) and Adam (Drums) — but he prefers to be called Swag… Don’t call him Gert.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you sound like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Imagine Larry David playing in a punk band.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Are you any good (honestly)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don’t believe the hype.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s your best song?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It hasn’t been written yet. To be honest, we were planning to just rip off <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/led-zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> on this record — but sadly <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/greta-van-fleet">Greta Van Fleet</a> beat us to it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s been your most memorable gig?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Opening for <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-rolling-stones">The Rolling Stones</a>. Well, opening for a band who opened for The Rolling Stones. Close enough, anyway.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tell us something really interesting about your band that isn’t to do with music.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a civil war in the band between those who love marijuana and those who love ice hockey.</p>

      <p>
        <b>What’s your karaoke song?</b>
      </p>
      <p>‘I Believe In A Thing Called Love’ by <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-darkness">The Darkness</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scenario: We’ve given you a shitload of money to make a big budget video – what do you do with it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Easy: re-shoot the <i>Borat</i> movie, shot-for-shot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you want to achieve with your music?</b>
      </p>

        <b>If your tour bus was hanging over the edge of a cliff and you needed to throw out one bandmember as ballast, who would it be and why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our manager Khazi. You really think any of us would sacrifice ourselves?… HA!</p>
      <p><b>Fill in the blanks: </b>When you listen to our music, it feels like <b>someone</b> is <b>stealing</b> your <b>money.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>If your band had ‘stans’ (superfans, like Katy Perry’s Kitty Cats or Lady Gaga’s Little Monsters), what would the name for them be?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Swagals.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where can we see you next?</b>
      </p>
      <p>November 21 at Elsewhere — Zone 1 in Brooklyn, NYC.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you want to happen at your last-ever show?</b>

        <b>Any final words?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Would you take a 3000-word review of a Russian nightclub in Coney Island? <i><b>(Yeah, we probably would)</b></i></p>
