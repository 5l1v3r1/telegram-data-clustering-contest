      <p>On the fundraising page, her sister said: "She's had numerous surgeries, the most recent one five weeks ago has left her with no movement in her left leg, unable to walk.</p>
      <p>"This infection has eluded the doctors for quite a while and they are now sending her overseas to seek other experts advice and treatment options."</p>
      <p>Donations will be used for extra costs incurred while going overseas and towards her rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>Her sister added: "Chloe is a kind, generous and loving girl, as anyone who has met her knows. </p>
