      <h1>Chelsea eye move for failed Barcelona signing worth over 100 million euros</h1>

      <h3>A major liability may be taken off Barcelona by Chelsea who are plotting a major squad revamp in the next summer after losing Eden Hazard to Real Madrid.</h3>
      <p>Liverpool sold Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona during the winter of 2018 and it has turned out to be a rather funny deal given that the Merseyside based club earned 145 million euros by selling a player who has completely flopped at the Camp Nou. But a little more than Coutinho’s move to Barca, there may be a big twist in the tale.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/bundesliga/1199259/reports-chelsea-emerge-favourites-signature-e75m-rated-barcelona-star-bayern-munich-philippe-coutinho/"><b>Fox Sports has reported</b></a> that Chelsea are interested in signing the Brazil international once their transfer ban is lifted to support new signing Christian Pulisic in their bid to replace the glorious Eden Hazard who signed for Real Madrid. Frank Lampard’s side is currently serving a transfer ban, but having sold Hazard and generally saved well, could sign a star name.</p>
      <p>Philippe Coutinho is currently on a loan at Bayern Munich and has succeeded there under an environment of relatively less pressure and stress as compared to Catalonia. The Bundesliga giants do have the option of signing the winger for an apparent 120 million euros, but with Niko Kovac’s sacking, they seem to be unclear over whether they will exercise their option.</p>
      <p>Barcelona had signed Philippe Coutinho for a club record fee, but the player could never settle well into the Camp Nou and his new city despite playing for Barca’s crosstown rivals Espanyol some years back. A lot of blame has been put on a tactically naïve Ernesto Valverde, but the bottom line is that Coutinho has been a failed signing.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are looking resilient under Frank Lampard after a rather inconsistent season in 2018/19 and would definitely benefit from Philippe Coutinho’s signing to add to their young crop of players. But it remains to be seen whether the former Inter man signs for the Blues given his associations with the Reds and the two teams’ title rivalry of late.</p>
      <p>In a bid to qualify for the Champions League, Chelsea visit the Etihad Stadium to take on a shaky Manchester City side next weekend and will look to Christian Pulisic to deliver. Meanwhile, Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde hopes to survive in his office for some more time as his side travels to Leganes following a lengthy international break.</p>
      <p>Do you think Chelsea will sign Philippe Coutinho during the upcoming calendar year?</p>
