        <b>At least three people are missing after a ship carrying sand capsized in the Meghna River in Munshiganj.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The vessel sank around 5am on Sunday following a collision with a launch near the Gajaria jetty.</p>
      <p>Four labourers were asleep onboard when the ship was hit by a Dhaka-bound launch MV Kirtankhola, said police.</p>
      <p>Two of the missing men were identified as 'Aslam', 24, and 'Emaidul', 38. The other labourer, 'Nizam', 40, managed to swim ashore.</p>

      <p>The launch's Captain Md Shahidul Islam and other two staffers, Jahangir Hossain and Yunus Bepari, have been arrested over the accident, said Coast Guard Station Officer MM Asif.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard had detained a sand-laden ship for sailing at night and was taking it to the Gajaria jetty when the incident occurred, said Gajaria Police Station chief Harun-Or-Rashid.</p>
      <p>The launch captain said the fog over the river hampered visibility and by the time the ship came into view, it was already to late to avoid a collision.</p>
      <p>Divers from the fire service are conducting a search for the missing men, said Munshiganj Deputy Commissioner Md Maniruzzaman.</p>
