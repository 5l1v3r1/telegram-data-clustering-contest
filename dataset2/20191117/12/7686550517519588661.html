      <p>Cars were stolen and others vandalised following an overnight crime spree in one part of Swansea.</p>
      <p>On the morning of Friday, November 15, several residents of Brynmill Crescent found that their cars had been targeted by thieves while they slept.</p>
      <p>Two of the vehicles had been stolen while others had their drivers side windows smashed.</p>
      <p>Lizzie Plumb, 21, who lives on the road, was staying at a friend's house when she received a call from the police saying her Seat Ibiza had been broken into.</p>
      <p>She said: "The police managed to find my number from my friends as the car was parked right opposite my house.</p>
      <p>"It was reported as criminal damage because nothing was stolen from my car, but the managed to steal other cars, apparently.</p>
      <p>"I go to uni with my brothers and we all use the car to go home or to our sporting fixtures, so it's really annoying."</p>

      <p>Third year English Literature student Ms Plumb said she relied on the car to take her brothers to tennis matches for Swansea University's first team.</p>
      <p>The siblings also use it to drive back to their family home in Surrey.</p>
      <p>"No one heard anything, so they think it happened late last night or in the early hours of this morning. Luckily, we've managed to get it into a garage already," she added.</p>
      <p>Someone else who lives on Brynmill Crescent, but wishes to remain anonymous, noticed the damaged vehicles as they were leaving for work.</p>
      <p>"I saw three damaged cars but there could have been more that had been broken into further down the road, it must have happened over night because I saw it when I left for work first thing this morning," they added.</p>
