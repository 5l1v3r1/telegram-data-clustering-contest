      <p>The United Aviation Corporation is looking to increase the annual production of MS-21 civilian aircraft to 120 planes a year through international cooperation, the head of the corporation, Yuri Slyusar, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201909161076813336-russian-mc-21-passenger-plane-to-debut-in-istanbul---manufacturer/">told</a> reporters on Sunday at an exhibition in Dubai.</p>
      <blockquote>"We are considering the possibility of international cooperation on the MS-21 aircraft. Our task is to bring its annual production in the future from 70 to 120 units," Slyusar said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to him, there are noteworthy companies on the international market that are technically equipped, particularly in composite production.</p>
      <blockquote>"Therefore, we are looking with interest at international cooperation involving such companies in the production of aircraft," said the head of the UAC.</blockquote>
      <p>At the same time, he emphasised that competition in the fieldÂ <a href="http://sputniknews.com/russia/20190316/1073303399.html">is very strong</a>, "therefore, our task is to be on a par with them."</p>
