      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> are interested in signing young Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga and reportedly view him as the long-term successor to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paul-pogba/">Paul Pogba</a>.</p>
      <p>Manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> already has a number of areas in the squad that need reinforcing in the transfer market, but Pogba’s current contract situation could quickly see a new midfielder become the top priority.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner is stalling over new terms, with his current deal expiring in 18 months, and that could force United to sell rather than risk losing their record signing for nothing.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10362873/man-utd-line-up-26m-transfer-bid-for-french-wonderkid-camavinga-as-pogba-heads-for-real-madrid-in-swap-deal-with-bale/">The Sun</a>, United have set their sights on Camavinga as a long-term replacement for Pogba – though they will have plenty of competition for one of Europe’s highest rated youngsters.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old has made himself a mainstay of the Rennes midfield, starting all 12 of their Ligue 1 matches this season and impressing with his precocious ability on the ball, composed passing and powerful dribbling.</p>

      <p>Although born in Angola, he obtained French citizenship at the start of November and was immediately called up to the Under-21 side for games against Georgia and Switzerland – replacing Matteo Guendouzi, who moved up to the senior squad.</p>
      <p>Despite his tender years, United would have to stump up a large sum to convince Rennes to sell Camavinga, who is believed to have a £26million release clause.</p>
      <p>Rennes is something of a talent factory, with the likes of Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele and Watford record signing Ismaila Sarr coming through the club in recent years.</p>

      <p>United are not the only club interested in the teenager either, with Barcelona keen to bring him to Camp Nou while Real Madrid’s French manager Zinedine Zidane is well aware of his compatriot’s ability.</p>
      <p>Of course, Zidane is rather more interested in luring Pogba to the Bernabeu – and has been for some time.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has been sidelined since picking up an ankle injury in September’s draw with Arsenal but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is hopeful that he will return to action in time for the Manchester derby at the start of December.</p>
