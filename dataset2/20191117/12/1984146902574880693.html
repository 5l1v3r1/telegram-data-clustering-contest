      <p>Newcastle United have been linked with a promising Portugal right-back and there are fresh Granit Xhaka claims in the Sunday newspapers.</p>
      <p>With only five weeks until the January transfer window there is a feeling that Newcastle will be active during that month – and targets haven’t exactly been hard to come by.</p>
      <p>On Sunday there was more talk of Xhaka, a Rafa Benitez claim and also a link to a right-back. Here’s what has been written.</p>
      <h3>Sunday Mirror</h3>
      <p>Arsenal will try to use Newcastle target Granit Xhaka as part of a deal to sign Borussia Monchengladbach’s Switzerland midfielder Denis Zakaria.</p>
      <p>The Mirror reports Bruce is “keen” on Xhaka and will make an approach in January as he looks to offer the Arsenal outcast first team football ahead of Euro 2020. But the Gunners may attempt to use Xhaka as part of a transfer swap which would see the highly-rated Zakaria move in the other direction.</p>
      <p>Bruce <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-transfer-news-gossip-14633665">has let it be known that he’s keen on Xhaka</a> as he looks for heavyweight midfield options for the second half of the season. A loan move has been mooted.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, columnist Andy Dunn believes Rafa Benitez will return to the Premier League soon – but Newcastle isn’t an option for a couple of good reasons.</p>
      <p>“As long as Mike Ashley owns it, Newcastle United will not be an ­option, obviously.</p>
      <p>“But anyway, while posts might come up at, say, West Ham, Arsenal or Southampton, the one at St James’ Park is unlikely to be vacated for some time.</p>
      <p>“Benitez is right when he says comparing seasons is not ­always fair.</p>
      <p>“And, although Steve Bruce has Newcastle a very welcome seven points better off than Rafa had them at this stage last season, let’s wait and see how it pans out over the whole piece.”</p>
      <p>He goes on to write that Bruce should be “shown some local love”.</p>

      <h3>Sunday Express</h3>
      <p>United have ‘sent scouts’ to watch Royal Antwerp’s Aurelio Buta – a 22-year-old attacking right-back who is a Portgual under-20 international.</p>
      <p>The defender, however, looks set to join Wolves as the Black Country club have made a move to secure him on loan. Nuno’s side will exploit their relationship with super agent Jorge Mendes to get the deal done.</p>
