      <p>Brooklyn Nine Nine is getting a tiny new addition to the squad, as Melissa Fumero is pregnant with her second child.</p>
      <p>The actress, who plays fave Amy Santiago on the series, has been hiding her bump as she admitted she was getting self-conscious during this pregnancy.</p>
      <p>However, sharing her happy news on Instagram, she decided to hell with it and shared her bump with the world on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Posing to the side to reveal a bump she’s managed to hide for a months, the star pulled a face as she stated: ‘Oh yeah, I’m hella pregnant. To be honest, I haven’t felt like posting about it because this pregnancy has been way harder and… I don’t feel that cute?</p>
      <p>‘But yesterday I got a really intense massage, an awesome chiropractic adjustment, and my hair feels thicker… so I feel a little bit cute today.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She ended the news with the hashtags #HereWeGoAgain and #BabyNumeroDos.</p>
      <p>Melissa and her husband David have been married since 2007, and together they have a three-year-old boy named Enzo.</p>
      <p>Her announcement comes four years to the day since she revealed her first pregnancy.</p>

      <p>Last time she was expecting, the team hilariously worked her baby bump into the plot – having Amy go undercover at a women’s prison as a pregnant inmate.</p>
      <p>Deciding to give Amy a bump in a bid to make her less likely to be attacked, in one scene she’s seen moving her belly and sighing: ‘I don’t know…do I even look pregnant.’</p>
      <p>On screen love interest Jake is then scene moving the ‘fake’ bump as well and in an unsure voice tells her: ‘I mean…I guess I can see it.’</p>
      <p>So with season seven being wrapped up as we speak, we can’t wait to see the excuse they come up with this time!</p>
      <p>Can we see a Jake and Amy baby on the horizon maybe…?</p>
