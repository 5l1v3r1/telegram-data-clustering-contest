      <h1>9 civilians killed in Russian airstrikes in Syria's northwestern Idlib</h1>

      <p>In an area of northwestern Syria that is supposed to be free of acts of aggression, at least nine civilians were killed and 10 others injured in Russian airstrikes on Sunday, a local civil defense agency said.</p>
      <p>The Russian warplanes carried out airstrikes on the villages of Bsakla, Uraynibah and two other villages in the northwestern province of Idlib, according to the Syrian opposition's aircraft observatory.</p>
      <p>The Assad regime also carried out mortar, gun, and rocket attacks in the Kafr Nabl district and three other villages of Idlib.</p>
      <p>Following the airstrikes, civil defense teams launched search and rescue efforts.</p>
      <p>The death toll from the attacks on residential areas in the Idlib de-escalation zone over the last month totals 75, including 13 children, said the White Helmets civil defense group.</p>
      <p>Additionally, in the first half of November, the attacks of the Assad regime and its supporter Russia have displaced some 40,000 civilians within the Idlib de-escalation zone, according to Syria's Response Coordination Group, a local nongovernmental organization.</p>
      <p>Turkey and Russia agreed last September to turn Idlib into a de-escalation zone where acts of aggression are expressly prohibited.</p>
      <p>The Syrian regime and its allies, however, have consistently broken the terms of the cease-fire, launching frequent attacks inside the zone.</p>
      <p>The de-escalation zone is currently home to some four million civilians, including hundreds of thousands displaced in recent years by regime forces from throughout the war-weary country.</p>
      <p>Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.</p>
      <p>Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 10 million others displaced, according to U.N. officials.</p>
