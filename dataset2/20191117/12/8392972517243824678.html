      <p>A very hopeful 10-year-old has asked for an iPhone 11, a Chanel purse and £3,000 in cash for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The child's Christmas <a href="https://twitter.com/a_johnson412/status/1194689352992903169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194689352992903169&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2019%2F11%2F15%2F10-year-old-girl-writes-hilarious-christmas-wish-list-asking-asenchal-oil-4000-dollars-11152072%2F">list</a> has gone viral on Twitter - and people can't believe the list of items she's asking for.</p>
      <p>While many kids ask Father Christmas for the latest toys, it seems this little girl has her heart set on much, much bigger things!</p>

      <p>A parent shared her daughter's list to <a href="https://twitter.com/a_johnson412/status/1194689352992903169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194689352992903169&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2019%2F11%2F15%2F10-year-old-girl-writes-hilarious-christmas-wish-list-asking-asenchal-oil-4000-dollars-11152072%2F">Twitter</a>. and the post has racked up over 100,000 'likes'.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "My 10 year old daughter must be out of her mind with this Christmas list."</p>
      <p>The list included a MacBook Air, Airpods, Gucci sliders, a GoPro and a "real bunny".</p>
      <aside>What’s a ten-year-old doing 4K and Gucci slides.</aside>
      <p>The little girl went on to ask for $4,000 (£3,099) in cash, new shoes, jewellery and a pair of checkered Vans as well!</p>
      <p>And her never-ending list also made requests for a series of toys, an alarm clock and new bedding.</p>
      <p>The woman's post on social media received almost 5,000 comments from fellow Twitter users.</p>

      <p>Many found the list hilarious with one tweeting: "4000 dollars and the Chanel purse is iconic," while another wrote: "What’s a ten-year-old doing 4K and Gucci slides," followed by laughing face emojis.</p>
      <p>A third added: "A Chanel bag girl I’m still waiting for mine and I’m 23," while one joked: "Get her that alarm clock sis! Tell her it’ll wake her up from that dream where she think she's getting everything on there."</p>
      <p>Another commented: "A girl that knows her worth, love to see it," followed by laughing emojis.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "Get her that alarm clock to wake up her up from these unrealistic dreams."</p>
