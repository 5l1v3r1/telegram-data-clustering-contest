      <h1>Aston Villa have tough stance on John McGinn amid Man Utd transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd have been linked with a move for Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn since the summer and could return to try and sign him in January having been given a transfer war chest</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:15:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa have no plans to sell midfield star John McGinn to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in January - and would only allow him to depart in the summer if an eye-watering offer was lodged.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils have been linked with a move for Scotland international McGinn when the transfer window reopens in under two months - with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer promised funds to boost his under performing squad.</p>
      <p>McGinn, who joined Villa for £2.75million from Hibernian in 2018, has brought his Championship form to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He has scored three goals, and set-up two more, in 12 appearances in the league this season, to prove he is right at home among the biggest clubs in England - despite Villa's disappointing start to the season.</p>
      <p>But despite his pedigree, United will not be getting their hands on him this summer.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/mcginn-villa-transfer-man-utd-17089754?_ga=2.234842782.102848659.1573925584-1626070328.1570958217">Birmingham Mail,</a> Villa will turn away any offer in January, although if an "offer of epic proportion" was to arrive in the summer then they would consider it.</p>
      <p>Manager Dean Smith has been cool on the interest in McGinn, who signed a five-year contract in the summer.</p>
      <p>"Our job is to improve players in order to improve our team," Smith told Sky Sports recently. "By him getting better, if it attracts suitors then so be it. There's nothing you can do to stop that.</p>

      <p>"In fact you encourage it because we're ambitious here at Aston Villa, we've got two owners who are looking to the future and want to keep the best players that we've got.</p>
      <p>"We're not a club that wants to sell. We want to keep improving as a team and we've got owners, thankfully, that want to do that.</p>
      <p>"The adoration of John McGinn is spreading very quickly."</p>
      <p>McGinn has previously admitted he laughed at being linked with a switch to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>"I had a little chuckle at it. I’m sure a lot of people did," he told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/john-mcginn-responds-manchester-united-18881113?_ga=2.94932190.358461159.1571150147-1359735596.1570612609">Daily Record</a> , also revealing his manager teased him about it.</p>
      <p>"Certainly the gaffer and the players here had a bit of banter about it at my expense," he added.</p>
      <p>"It is up to me to go and prove it is justified. At that point my whole mindset was on Villa and being successful here."</p>
