      <p>Netflix, the ever so popular streaming service, providing some of the best series at such an affordable price. This has changed the media consumption of Malaysians at a steady pace and some don’t even watch the local TV anymore.</p>
      <p>However, like all good things, there must be challenges to be faced here and there, especially in Malaysia where we often blame others about how the youth is reacting instead of fixing the approach that is taken at home by the parents.</p>

      <p>The Malaysia National Film Development Corporation (Finas) has released a statement, as reported by <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/11/16/finas-calls-for-putrajaya-to-censor-netflix-here/1810472">Malay Mail</a>, urging the government to regulate and censor content on Netflix. The chief executive, Ahmad Idham claims that parents are now worried about the uncensored content which can negatively affect the country’s youth.</p>
      <p>
        <i>I don’t think there’s a basikal lajak content on Netflix though.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Well, Netflix’s contents are based on the regulations of a country. The shows that are streamed in the US are different than the ones shown here. But, if you are a Netflix subscriber, you would know that it has a parental lock feature where parents themselves can regulate the content watched by their children.</p>

      <p>
        <i>See, what did I say about the approach taken at home instead of blaming others? </i>
      </p>
      <p>Netizens generally are not happy with the suggestion and took to the internet to voice out their opinions.</p>

      <p>Local controversial illustrator Fahmi Reza has also highlighted a simple way to control what children can watch at home in his recent <a href="https://twitter.com/kuasasiswa/status/1195686300960968706">tweet</a>. He tweeted,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“Dear Government. Don’t listen to Finas. You don’t have to censor Netflix. We can do it outselves at home.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>He also included the four simple steps in doing so at home.</p>

      <p>See it is not that hard, isn’t it? Instead of blatantly making a suggestion that might actually cause people to pirate shows, which is also something Finas is fighting against, we should just educate those who don’t know that you can actually control the content being watched by your kids with just the remote. Let’s not bug the government who are busy with other more vital tasks crucial to the development of the country.</p>
