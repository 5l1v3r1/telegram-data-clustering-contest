      <p>"Which one of them is it?”</p>
      <p>That's the bizarre question, Wolverhampton Wanderers legend Carl Ikeme has been asking after revealing a shock familial link with either Ant or Dec.</p>

      <p>“I mention that I had a random message 2 years ago on @Ancestry saying you have Well known 4th cousin and do I know about my Irish heritage.</p>
      <p>“After searching the production company who had contacted me I realised that it seems to have produced Ant and Dec’s DNA story . So I suppose the only thing to ask now is which one them is it?”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ikeme was forced to retire from the game in 2018, after being diagnosed with acute leukaemia in 2017. He has now revealed he is in 'complete remission' and remains an intensely popular figure at Molineux.</p>
