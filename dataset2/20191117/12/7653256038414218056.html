      <p>NEW DELHI: The government is considering to re-introduce restrictions on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/royalty-payments">royalty payments</a> for technology transfer in view of excessive outflow of such funds to overseas companies, sources said. A proposal in this regard will soon be circulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) for inter-ministerial consultation, sources said.</p>
      <p>According to the proposal, limits could be imposed on royalty payments in case of technology transfer or collaboration involving foreign entities either directly or indirectly through any firm in India.</p>
      <p>A similar proposal was mooted by the department last year. That time it had proposed that royalty payments should be capped at 4 per cent of domestic sales and 7 per cent of exports for the first four years; and for the next three years the limit should be 3 per cent of local sales and 6 per cent of exports.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/finance-ministry">finance ministry</a> had raised objections over the proposal saying it could send a negative signal to foreign investors.</p>
      <p>The increase in outflow of these payments started after the government liberalised the FDI policy in 2009. It had removed the cap and permitted Indian companies to pay a royalty to their technical collaborators without seeking prior government approval.</p>
      <p>Royalty is paid to a foreign collaborator for the transfer of technology, usage of brand or trademarks.</p>
      <p>In April 2017, a surge in royalty outflow prompted the government to set up an inter-ministerial group to analyse payment norms and see whether there is excessive payout by Indian companies to foreign collaborators.</p>
      <p>Proposing these restrictions, the department had argued that the curbs would help increase the profits of domestic companies, mainly in the automobile sector, prevent depletion of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/foreign-exchange-reserves">foreign exchange reserves</a>, protect the interest of minority shareholders and increase revenue for the government.</p>
      <p>Before 2009, royalty payments were regulated by the government and capped at 8 per cent of exports and 5 per cent of domestic sales in the case of technology transfer collaborations. They were fixed at 2 per cent of exports and 1 per cent of domestic sales for use of trademark or brand name.</p>
      <p>Auto major Maruti <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/maruti-suzuki-india-ltd/stocks/companyid-11890.cms">Suzuki</a> pays an average royalty of around 5.5 per cent of its net sales to its parent Suzuki.</p>
