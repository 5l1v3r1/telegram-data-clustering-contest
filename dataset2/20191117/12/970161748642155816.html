      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s ex-wife Chrystie Scott has claimed the Olympian had dreamed of transitioning to a woman for 40 years before finally being able to.</p>
      <p>Chrystie was married to the new I’m a Celebrity camp mate from 1972 to 1981, having two children together – Burt, 41, and Cassandra, 39.</p>
      <p>But just a year into their marriage, Caitlyn confided in Chystie their ‘fantasy’ of becoming a woman.</p>
      <p>Despite their split, the pair remained friends with Caitlyn going on to marry Linda Thompson and having two more sons with her – Brody and Brandon Jenner.</p>
      <p>Chrystie – who still refers to her ex-husband as her now dead-name Bruce – <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-wanted-20897738">told The Mirror</a>: ‘I was shocked. He was so masculine.</p>
      <p>‘It never occurred to me it might have caused him anxiety. There was no indication in any area of our marriage.</p>
      <p>‘He said it was a fantasy and he wasn’t going to act on his desire. I had never seen him dressing up in women’s clothes or anything like that.’</p>

      <p>When their relationship ended, Caitlyn later flew out Chrystie to California in 1985, revealing then she was transgender and had plans to transitioning to a woman.</p>

      <p>Admitting she ‘cried for two days straight’ when Caitlyn told her, the soon-to-be reality mega star reportedly assured her that her ex-husband ‘was still here and not going anywhere.’</p>
      <p>Caitlyn finally came out publicly as transgender in 2015, shortly after ending her marriage to Kris Jenner after 24 years together.</p>
