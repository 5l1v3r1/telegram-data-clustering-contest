      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/us/louisiana-governor-edwards-rispone.html">According to The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/b65e73cbb2304514997d073a36e5bcbd">The Associated Press</a>, Edwards, who is considered moderate, received 51% of votes to Rispone's 49% in Saturday's runoff election. They were separated by a margin of about 40,000 votes, officials said.</p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://youtu.be/i24jrfIEjXs">victory speech</a> Saturday night, Edwards said he spoke to Rispone, a businessman, and thanked him for "putting himself out there for public service."</p>
      <p>"We both agreed that the time for campaigning is over, and now, our shared love for Louisiana is always more important than the partisan differences that sometimes divide us," <a href="https://youtu.be/i24jrfIEjXs">Edwards said</a>.</p>
      <p>After a brief pause, he continued: "And as for the president, God bless his heart." </p>
      <p>Edwards was referring to President Donald Trump's support for Rispone, who had appeared with the president at a rally just two days earlier.</p>

      <p>Rispone acknowledged Trump's efforts in his concession speech.</p>
      <p>"Can we give President Trump a round of applause?" <a href="https://youtu.be/oLZZ4Ee0ie0">Rispone asked supporters</a>, who cheered. "That man loves America, and he loves Louisiana."</p>
