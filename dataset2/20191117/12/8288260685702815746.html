      <h1>'Disgraceful' - Chelsea fans are fuming over this Aston Villa decision</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | After making his debut in the infamous win over Bulgaria last month, the AVFC defender is set to earn his second cap</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:46:10+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> defender Tyrone Mings is expected to earn his second international cap when Engand meet Kosovo in Pristina.</p>
      <p>After making his debut in the win over Bulgaria that was marred by incidents of racism, the Villa man is once again expected to slot in at the heart of England's defence.</p>

      <p>Mings was an unused substitute for England's most recent Euro 2020 Qualifier, with John Stones and Harry Maguire given the nod for the 7-0 thrashing of Montenegro.</p>
      <p>But with qualification assured, England boss Gareth Southgate is expected to ring the changes for the final Group A fixture, with competition for places in next summer's squad heating up.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sky Sports have reported that Mings is expected to be drafted into the starting line-up, with Nick Pope in goal and Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi given a chance from the off.</p>
      <p>However, Chelsea supporters are less than impressed that defender Fikayo Tomori is, once again, expected to be overlooked. The former Derby County loanee has enjoyed a fine start to the season and many believe now is the chance to give him his debut on the international stage</p>

      <p><b>@Chris_Simms24:</b> But not Tomori disgraceful again from Southgate</p>
      <p><b>@Mythicalmateo:</b> If he gets a game over Tomori then idek with Southgate... he's already had his debut and we've qualified, just let the kid play</p>
      <p><b>@cfcangelia:</b> Tomori deserves a start</p>
      <p><b>@Acehoodflow:</b> Absolutely no reason for Tomori and CHO to not start tonight</p>

      <p><b>@ashleighward96:</b> We want Tomori</p>
      <p><b>@TomBeard94:</b> Watching @SkySportsNews and they're saying that Tyrone Mings is likely to start tonight. Surely, after the season he's having, Tomori has to be first choice! I'm amazed he didn't start against Montenegro</p>
      <p><b>@Agham1992:</b> Start Tomori and Abraham as well</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@ACParee:</b> If Tomori doesn’t start it’ll be blasphemy.</p>
      <p><b>@IzzyBaller17:</b> Where’s Tomori?</p>
