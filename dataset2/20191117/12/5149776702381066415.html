      <h1>Profits tumble at Notts County's former parent company as it takes control of golf club</h1>
      <h2>A report for Paragon Leisure also reveals debts were written off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:39:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>Notts County's former parent company Paragon Leisure has taken "significant control" of the Nottinghamshire Golf and Country Club, it has emerged.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/more-13m-owed-alan-hardys-3392051">Paragon Leisure</a> was used in 2017 to buy shares in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">County</a> before owner Alan Hardy sold the club in the summer, following financial difficulties and a dreadful season which ultimately ended in relegation to non league.</p>
      <p>Now, the company's annual accounts have been revealed for the years ending June 30, 2018, and June 30 this year.</p>
      <p>According to the financial statements, released on Companies House, the firm's profits before tax tumbled from £3.5 million in 2018 to £933,457 this year. There was, however, a slight rise in turnover of about £400,000 to £3.5 million.</p>
      <p>A statement signed off by director Mr Hardy in a strategic report said: "The group's main activity during the period was that of a golf and country club.</p>
      <p>"The group has experienced another period of growth in turnover as it seeks to increase its membership numbers as well as associated revenue offerings.</p>
      <p>"This aspiration has been boosted this year with the newly-extended hotel offering.</p>
      <p>"The director is always looking for opportunities to improve the facilities and this has seen further improvements made in the year."</p>
      <p>Paragon Leisure was one company linked to failed fit-out firm Paragon Interiors, which was founded by Mr Hardy, when it collapsed into administration in February this year. Ninety jobs were eventually lost.</p>
      <p>Paragon Leisure owed £7.29 million to Interiors, which was due a total of £13.8m from groups linked to it. This was eventually settled for £1.2m.</p>
      <p>The new report has stated that during the last year "£484,170 owed by companies and £1,891,265 owed to companies in which the director (Mr Hardy) has a participating interest was written off due to an agreement signed after the year end between the respective parties."</p>
      <p>There is no mention in the strategic report about Paragon Leisure's previous involvement with Notts County.</p>
      <p>However, a statement signed off by independent auditor Duncan and Toplis, confirms Paragon Leisure Group Limited held 100 percent of the share capital at the end of the reporting period (June 30, 2019).</p>
