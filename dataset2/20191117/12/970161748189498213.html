      <p>If <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a> fans thought that the record-breaking, years-in-the-making <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>: Endgame meant the end of the franchise’s stronghold on moviegoers, think again.</p>
      <p>The next four years look set to be quite Marvel-lous (sorry) as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/disney-sets-release-dates-next-five-marvel-movies-not-prepared-11166442/"> set the release dates</a> for some massive blockbusters, sequels and new franchises.</p>
      <p>What’s next from the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</p>
      <h3>What is Marvel’s Phase Four?</h3>
      <p>On top of the recently announced future release dates for different projects, Marvel have had their ‘Phase Four’ planned for a while.</p>
      <p>This phase was announced around the same time as Avengers: Endgame closed phases one to three – known as ‘The Infinity Saga’ – that started with Iron Man back in 2008 and was made up of 22 films that all connected on some level.</p>

      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>If her death wasn’t bad enough the first time, Marvel made us relive it with an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-reveals-alternative-black-widow-death-just-cruel-marvel-11122643/">alternative death scene recently released.</a></p>
      <p>Tears for Natasha aside, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/21/scarlett-johansson-teases-black-widows-flawed-side-marvel-announce-release-date-10435210/">Black Widow</a> is set to kick Phase Four off strongly with a prequel all about the spy.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the role, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/scarlett-johansson/">Scarlett Johansson</a> said: ‘I get to play Natasha as a fully realised woman and in all of her many facets. I’m excited for fans to see the flawed side of her, what she perceives to be the flawed side of her, and I’m looking to wipe out some of that red in my ledger so you guys will be seeing more of that.’</p>
