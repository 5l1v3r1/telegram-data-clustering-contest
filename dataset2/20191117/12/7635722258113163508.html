      <p>Met Éireann says that it will be very cold tonight, with minimum air temperatures dropping from minus-2 to minus-4 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>There will also be widespread "sharp to severe" frost with the risk of icy patches.</p>
      <p>While there could also be some shallow fog patches inland, it will be less cold near the east coasts.</p>
