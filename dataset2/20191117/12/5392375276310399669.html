      <p>Recently, the very first hands-on image of the smartphone surfaced on the internet. Thanks to the folks at <i>Pricebaba</i>, we now have a realtime idea on the device’s design. As you can see from the images, Vivo U20 will feature a waterdrop notch on the front which houses the front selfie camera. Coming to the bezels, the smartphone seems to carry very few of them on the sides with a relatively thicker chin at the bottom side.</p>
      <p>The other image reveals a triple camera module at the back along with a fingerprint sensor. You can also see the concentric accent on the primary sensor. The same accent color can be seen around the entire camera module as well as on the branding.  The leaked hands-on images line up with the leaked renders as well as the Amazon listing of the smartphone. Well, the leaked live images of the device do not reveal anything new. Since we know almost everything about the device, let’s talk about the specs and features we know so far.</p>
      <h3>Specifications, Features</h3>
      <p>Vivo U20 will run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chipset paired with 6GB of RAM and UFS 2.1 onboard memory. The device is backed by a massive 5,000mAh battery packed inside. The phone will come with the support of 18W dual-engine fast charging. The company is claiming a standby time of 273 hours, 21 hours of continuous Instagram, 17 hours on Facebook, and 11 hours of YouTube playback. Furthermore, the device will make use of the USB Type-C port and will retain the 3.5-mm headphone jack. As per the various rumors, Vivo U3 might launch in India as the rebranded Vivo U20.</p>
