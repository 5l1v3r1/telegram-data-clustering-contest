        <b>A photographer managed to get some snaps of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world/us_and_canada">three-antlered deer</a> in Michigan, USA this week. A wildlife expert described the find as one-in-a-million. This means that there are better odds of finding a three-antlered deer than of a certain Australian actually being the creator of Bitcoin.</b>

      <h3>Bitcoin Price: More Consolidation</h3>
      <p>There hasn’t been a lot to get excited about for bitcoin price this week. Whilst a late push last Sunday saw BTC poke its head over $9k once again, a retracement the next day saw all of those gains wiped out.</p>
      <p>Price then remained mostly range-bound between $8.7k and $8.8k, and seemed quite content with its sideways action. That is, until Friday, when a couple of hours trading saw a couple of hundred dollars wiped from the price.</p>
      <p>Since then BTC has hovered around the $8500 mark, again seemingly comfortable to move sideways for the time being.</p>
      <p>So another week of consolidation then, and we will just have to wait and see which direction price heads next.</p>
      <p>Some believe that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-at-huge-risk-of-crashing-to-7300/">a crash to $7300</a> is the next likely scenario, whereas others think that a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-run-due-next-week-according-to-difficulty-adjustment/">bull-run could be due</a> as soon as next week.</p>
      <p>Volumes remain strong, with the past 90-days seeing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-90-day-volume-breaks-bullish-above-peak-2017-levels/">more action than at the 2017 peak</a>, although the majority of this is on futures markets rather than spot-trading.</p>
      <h3>Race For The Lead In The Blockchain Space</h3>
      <p>The CFTC chairman urged the US to take a more active role in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space this week, saying that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-chairman-america-should-lead-the-blockchain-space/">if possible, the US should lead</a>. Unfortunately it may already be a bit late for that, with his own organisation one of the chief culprits.</p>
      <p>Although the Chinese government has managed to successfully flip-flop from crypto-sceptic to blockchain champions, so who knows? Following President Xi’s endorsement of the tech, blockchain spending in the country is set to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-spending-in-china-to-exceed-2-billion-by-2023/">exceed $2 billion by 2023</a>.</p>
      <p>However, it seems highly unlikely that US forces will be receiving <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/china-worlds-largest-army-rewarded-crypto/">rewards in cryptocurrency</a> any time soon, as it is rumoured their Chinese counterparts might.</p>
      <p>The US is also several steps behind in terms of releasing its own digital dollar, with Chinese Central Bank sources claiming that its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/china-crypto-yuan-huge-threat-to-the-us/">digital Yuan will retain anonymity</a> for those who require it.</p>
      <p>Whether you believe that or not, it is certainly light years ahead of anything the US has up its sleeve. A report by (the ever cutting-edge) IBM, suggests that Central Bank Digital Currencies could well be the next big thing… and could even be <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ibm-central-bank-issued-cryptocurrency-five-years/">ready for use within the next five years</a>.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin and Blockchain</h3>
      <p>Chinese mining hardware manufacturer, Canaan, is set to finally begin its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-hardware-maker-to-hold-a-desperate-ipo/">oft-delayed IPO</a> this coming week. However, in the course of last week, the amount hoped to be raised <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/canaan-mining-may-settle-for-modest-100m-ipo/">fell from $400 million to $100 million</a>, so who knows if that will actually happen.</p>
      <p>The son of former US president George HW Bush, and brother of former US president George W Bush, was allegedly paid $300k for attending a meeting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-george-bushs-son-received-300k-from-onecoin-scam/">promoting ponzi-scheme, OneCoin</a>.</p>
      <p>Telegram has responded to the SEC’s complaint about its proposed ICO, by basically <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/telegram-denies-almost-everything-in-latest-court-response/">denying almost everything that the SEC has alleged</a>.</p>
      <p>Tether also notified its intent to file a motion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-fights-back-tries-dismisses-weak-lawsuits/">dismissing outstanding lawsuits against it</a>, in a New York court of law.</p>
      <h3>And Finally…</h3>
      <p>Does anyone remember a (Dr) Craig S Wright?</p>
      <p>Some years ago he unsuccessfully tried to persuade people that he was Satoshi Nakamoto, then forked the BCH fork of Bitcoin, proclaiming his new version as Satoshi’s Vision.</p>
      <p>Well, I’m not sure that you’re going to believe this, but it seems that some of the things he has said in the past are not strictly correct…</p>
      <p>This week, the serial forger, and (thankfully) recently less media-hungry wannabe-Satoshi saw his prediction of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/craig-wright-predicted-bitcoin-litecoin-should-be-dead-by-now/">the death of BTC and LTC</a> spectacularly fail to materialise.</p>
      <p>Still, as it celebrates its first birthday, there must be something worth celebrating for Bitcoin SV… <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sv-miners-forced-to-hodl-crypto-fund-cio-says/">or perhaps not</a>?</p>
