      <p>The Adamawa State Government has committed N46 million to access medical supplies acquired but unclaimed by previous administrations.</p>
      <p>Governor Ahmadu Fintiri approved the N46 million for release of the six containers of the medical equipment which had been left at a port in Lagos since 2014.</p>
      <p>The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Engr Bashir Ahmad, said while inspecting the equipment on arrival in Yola at the weekend, that the medical supplies, which are mostly for maternity use for safe deliveries, are meant for the German Medical Centre, Yola.</p>
      <p>The German Medical Centre is a state government facility established to render world-class medical services.</p>
      <p>It is located within the similarly state-owned Specialist Hospital, Yola.</p>

      <p>Bashir Ahmed revealed that on two occasions, the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) put up the equipment for auctioning due to the long delay in claiming them, but that some Adamawa citizens moved each time to stop the auctioning.</p>
      <p>He explained that of the N46 million meant to reclaim the equipment, N26 million was paid as clearance fees, while N20 million is reserved as payment upon delivery of the equipment.</p>
