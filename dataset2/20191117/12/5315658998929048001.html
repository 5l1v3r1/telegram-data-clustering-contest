      <p>Please attribute to Detective Senior Sergeant Kathryn Bostock, Manager Auckland City Crime Squad:</p>
      <p>Police are investigating after two suspicious fires at a property on Manukau Road, Epsom, this weekend.</p>
      <p>At around 3am on Saturday, emergency services were called after a shop front at the property was set alight.</p>
      <p>Then, at around 3am this morning, a car was driven into the shop front and set alight.</p>
      <p>The occupants of a residential property above the store were home at the time of both incidents.</p>
      <p>While they were fortunately not injured in either incident, Police are mindful that the outcome could have been very different, and we are taking this matter very seriously.</p>
      <p>We would like to hear from anyone in the Manukau Road area around the times of these two incidents, who may have seen something which could assist our enquiries.</p>
      <p>If you can help, please call 105 and quote file number 191117/1234.</p>
      <p>ENDS</p>
