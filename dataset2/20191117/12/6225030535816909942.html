      <p>Flurry Racing’s <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Mr_Misunderstood">Mr. Misunderstood</a></b> will attempt to continue his path of success at Fair Grounds following his late-closing win Saturday afternoon in the $175,000 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_River_City">River City</a></b> (Grade 3) at Churchill Downs.</p>
      <p>“We’ll probably take him down to Fair Grounds like we did in 2018 after he won the Jefferson Cup,” trainer Brad Cox said. “What’s most important is we keep him happy and healthy and he’ll continue to reward us.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Misunderstood loves Churchill Downs but has found success at Fair Grounds with four of his 13-career wins coming at the New Orleans oval.</p>
      <p>With his victory on Saturday, Mr. Misunderstood joined 2012-13 Horse of the Year Wise Dan and top sprinter Limousine Liberal as the only horses in the last 28 years to win five career stakes races at Churchill Downs.</p>
