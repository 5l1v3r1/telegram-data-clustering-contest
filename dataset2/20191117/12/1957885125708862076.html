      <p>Double Fine's business development VP, Greg Rice, has left the company just months after the studio was acquired by Microsoft.</p>
      <p>As spotted by our friends at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/double-fines-publishing-head-departs-months-after-xbox-acquisition/">VGC</a>, Rice confirmed the departure on his personal Twitter account on Friday. He'd been at the studio for almost ten years across a range of positions, but most recently led the company's publishing business, Double Fine Presents.</p>
      <p>Concerns about Double Fine's publishing arm surfaced shortly after Microsoft's acquisition back in June, with boss Tim Schafer saying <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tim-schafer-says-double-fine-presents-may-shut-down-but-it-ll-live-on-in-spirit-565977.phtml">at the time</a>: "How Double Fine Presents will evolve is kind of an unknown," and that "from a business sense, I don't know if it structurally makes sense to have a publisher within [another publisher]. It's a complicated issue".</p>

      <p>"Here's something I never thought I'd say, yesterday was my last day at Double Fine," Rice wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/GregRicey/status/1195410041509036032">Twitter</a>. "It's been a dream come true working with the world's greatest human [Tim Schafer] and the crew of incredibly talented, caring, wonderful people he's assembled at Double Fine for the last decade.</p>
      <p>"I'm so proud of all the amazing things we've accomplished and really really sad to leave, but am comforted to be leaving them in a great spot with Psychonauts 2 looking amazing and the Microsoft sale ensuring many many more of the insanely creative games you've come to expect."</p>
      <p>While Rice has yet to confirm precisely where he's moving on to, he added that it was "time [he] set off on some new adventures" and confirmed he's "got something really cool lined up, still in games, and am excited about the future".</p>
      <p>"But for now, I'm going to enjoy these final moments with some of my best friends of all time and try not to dissolve into a puddle," he concluded.</p>
