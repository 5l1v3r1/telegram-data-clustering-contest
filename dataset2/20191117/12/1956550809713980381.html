      <h2>Did the Grammy Award-winner, New Rules singer light up The Pointe?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:06:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author">Time Out Dubai staff</a></address>
      <p>There have been loads of massive gigs announced in the past few weeks (see: <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/422899-tickets-to-huge-iron-maiden-show-in-dubai-now-on-sale">Iron Maiden at the Coca-Cola Arena</a>, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/423032-lewis-capaldi-announces-first-uae-concert">Lewis Capaldi</a>, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/nightlife/422885-madness-coming-to-dubai-in-2020">Madness</a> and the incredible line up for <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/422010-tickets-go-on-sale-for-emirates-airline-dubai-jazz-festival-2020">Dubai Jazz Fest</a>), but one of the lesser-known venues on Dubai’s music scene played host to global superstar Dua Lipa on Friday (November 15).<br/><br/>The Grammy Award-winner performed at <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/415233-five-new-restaurants-to-check-out-in-dubai">The Pointe, Palm Jumeirah</a> on Friday November 15, with a concert marking The Pointe’s second international gig after <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars-nightlife/390866-enrique-iglesias-to-play-in-dubai-this-year">Enrique Iglesias</a> performed at the grand opening of the waterfront destination back in 2018.<br/><br/>New Rules singer Dua Lipa played a 90-minute set on a purpose-built stage on the water. Refreshingly, she hit the stage perfectly on time much to the delight of the thousands of fans waiting on the promenade.<br/><br/>The energetic songstress performed all her classic hits such as One Kiss, No Lie and Scared To Be Lonely while throwing in some album songs for her more dedicated fans. She worked hard to close the distance (metaphorical and literal) between herself out on the water and the audience back on dry land, and it worked, the crowd got involved by singing along and bouncing along on-command to the tried-and-tested ‘how high can you jump?’ favourite.<br/><br/>The two stand-out moments of the show came later on in the evening. This was not only Dua Lipa’s first gig in Dubai but the first time she's played her new song ‘Don’t Start Now’ live. As expected it went down a treat and had one of the biggest reactions of the night. The second highlight came during the encore, after a set full of hits and choreographed dance routines the singer said her thanks and goodbyes and left the stage.<br/><br/>But where were her biggest hits, ‘IDGAF’ and ‘New Rules’? We didn’t have a long wait to find out as a few minutes later the popstar returned and closed the show with the two fan favourite songs, getting a rapturous response from the crowd.<br/><br/>There were free shuttle buses to escort gig-goers off the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/palm-jumeirah">Palm</a>, or if the thought of going home so soon didn’t appeal there are <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/415233-five-new-restaurants-to-check-out-in-dubai">plenty of dining options available</a>, with many of the eateries staying open until 1am and beyond.<br/><br/>For a full night out featuring live music, a backdrop of Atlantis The Palm, food and drink, The Pointe works as a venue, and Lipa is a top live act.</p>
