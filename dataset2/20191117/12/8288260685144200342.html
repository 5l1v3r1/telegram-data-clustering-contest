      <p>A mum was left "disgusted" after her Christmas presents arrived "opened and in different packaging".</p>
      <p>Kerryann Mcildoon said the packages sent by her son arrived in a box with a label on for a "shower greyhound coat".</p>
      <p>Worryingly, she claims they did not arrive in the Royal Mail box it had been sent in.</p>
      <p>The mum, of Hull, East Yorkshire, says when presents ordered by her son via Hermes arrived they were already "open" - and in different packaging to what they had been sent in .</p>
      <p>She said the package sent by her son Daryl, who lives in Luton, Bedfordshire was not delivered on Tuesday as planned.</p>

      <p>When he contacted Hermes, he was told the label was damaged so it was not delivered, and it was instead going to going to arrive on Thursday.</p>
      <p>When the package arrived, Mrs Mcildoon claims she was devastated to find the opened presents and said they arrived in a box with a label on for a "shower greyhound coat" and not in the Royal Mail box it had been sent in,  <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/hermes-delivery-christmas-presents-disgusted-3543267">Hull Live reports.</a></p>

      <p>She said: "I'm absolutely disgusted.</p>
      <p>"He sent me my Christmas presents through Hermes, the couriers. He phones me on Tuesday and said you should receive the parcel between 10am and 2pm.</p>
      <p>"He [my son] said did you get the parcel? I said, no I didn't get the parcel.</p>

      <p>"[he was told] The label was damaged on the box so they couldn't deliver it.</p>
      <p>"My son phoned on Thursday morning and said your parcel is coming today.</p>
      <p>"The box wasn't properly sealed and the presents have been opened."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ms Mcildoon says the box they were sent in had a label on for a "shower greyhound coat".</p>
      <p>"It's not even a proper box," she said. "There was one strip of Sellotape on the top.</p>
      <p>"My son is disgusted. The box has been opened and the  presents  were open.</p>
      <p>"He wrapped them in Christmas paper. They have opened them quite a bit.</p>
      <p>Hermes says the external packaging for the parcel was damaged so its team repacked them and said all items have now been "safely delivered".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It apologised for any inconvenience.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Hermes said: "Unfortunately the external packaging for this parcel was damaged.</p>
      <p>"Our team repacked them and all items have now been safely delivered. We apologise for any inconvenience."</p>
