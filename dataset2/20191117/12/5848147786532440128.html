      <h1>Tally of homes lost to NSW fires approaches 500 with little hope they will be the last</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:55:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/sarah-thomas/" target="_blank">Sarah Thomas</a></address>
      <p>Nearly 500 homes have been lost in New South Wales since the start of bushfire season, the Rural Fire Service has confirmed.</p>
      <p>NSW RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said 476 homes had been destroyed at the latest count, as firefighters today set about tackling 56 fires, 27 of which were uncontained.</p>
      <p>The update comes as NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet and Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott are set to announce a new round of funding for residents and local councils affected by the bushfires in the fire-hit region of Kempsey.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Mr Elliott said part of the package would be more funding for BlazeAid, the volunteer organisation that helps rural families rebuild buildings and fences.</p>
      <p>The RFS’s Building Impact Assessment teams found at least 577 outbuildings had also been destroyed.</p>

      <p>It said more than 2,600 buildings in the area directly hit by fires had been saved.<br/>On Sunday morning, three fires were at watch and act level: the Gospers Mountain fire north-west of Sydney, and the Myall Creek and Border Trail fires in the far north of the state.</p>
      <p>Fire crews were using the milder conditions today to strengthen containment lines ahead of a return of hot, dangerous conditions on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner Rogers said controlled burning was being undertaken around homes threatened by the Gospers Mountain blaze.</p>
      <p>He said firefighters were scrambling to draw containment lines before weather conditions deteriorated again.</p>
      <p>Five total fire bans are in place today including the Hunter, Far North Coast, New England, Northern Slopes and North Western regions.</p>

      <p>Deputy Commissioner Rogers said the fire would continue spreading further to the east once the westerly winds returned.</p>
      <p>“It’s fair to say that there’s going to be a long time spent dealing with these fires and it’s not going to be over quickly,” he said.</p>
      <p>He reiterated warnings about smoke pollution in areas including Taree, Port Macquarie and Kempsey, and said people with respiratory conditions needed to stay out of the smoke.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, he said crews from interstate and New Zealand were bolstering efforts to relieve exhausted volunteers, and that five large air tankers would be in service for the summer.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five firefighters from New Zealand would be deployed to the Mid North Coast at Wauchope on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>He said even with firefighters on the ground, people needed to continue to do their part.</p>
      <p>“Last week, when we had that really bad batch of weather, the community stepped up. We had fires reported to us really quickly [and] people moved out of areas of high risk,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We need people to carry out that sort of activities all throughout summer.”</p>
