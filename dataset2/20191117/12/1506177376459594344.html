      <p>Greece’s 21-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas captured the biggest title of his career being crowned the winner of the Nitto ATP Finals 2019 and earning $2,656,000 in prize money.</p>
      <p>The Greek debutant was the youngest of the eight qualifiers for the elite season-ender and Tsitsipas displayed his best performance to claim his biggest title to date.</p>
      <p>The sixth-seeded Greek defeated fifth seed Dominic Thiem of Austria 6-7(6), 6-2, 7-6(4) in two hours and 35 minutes in the championship in London.</p>

      <p>At 21 years and three months, Tsitsipas is the youngest Nitto ATP Finals champion since former World No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt (20) in 2001 in Sydney.</p>
      <p>“I have no clue how I played so well in the second set,” said Tsitsipas. “I think my mind was at ease and I wasn’t really thinking of much, which led to such a great performance in the second set, breaking him twice,” said Tsitsipas.</p>

      <p>“The crowd was just phenomenal, having such an army behind me while I am on the court. They give me so much energy. They give me the belief that I can achieve the things I want to achieve on the court. They motivate me. They just give me so much energy in general and I just love that. I would like to thank every single one who came here to support me today with the Greek flags. They made it feel like home.”</p>
