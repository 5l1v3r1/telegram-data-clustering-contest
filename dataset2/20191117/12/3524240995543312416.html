      <h1>Four more deaths in Bolivia protests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T12:28:14+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Four more people have died in protests in Bolivia, raising the total number killed in the political unrest to 23, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said Saturday.</p>
      <p>The new deaths were announced after five protesters were killed in clashes with security forces on Friday in central Bolivia, a political stronghold of exiled ex-president Evo Morales.</p>
      <p>The Washington-based IACHR, a part of the Organization of American States, also recorded 122 wounded since Friday.</p>
      <p>While the rights commission counts nine dead over the past two days, the official government tally remains at five.</p>
      <p>Interim leader Jeanine Anez’s cabinet chief Jerjes Justiniano told reporters Saturday night that he would ask for “forensic doctors to speed up their work,” but did not confirm a higher toll.</p>
      <p>Fierce clashes between Morales’ supporters and police forces have been ongoing since Anez, 52, declared herself acting president on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The former deputy senate speaker took over the top job to avoid a power vacuum — a move endorsed by the Constitutional Court.</p>
      <p>The IACHR said it considers as “serious” her Thursday decree authorizing the armed forces to participate in maintaining order and exempting them from any criminal responsibility.</p>
      <p>Morales, 60, said on Twitter that the measure gave “carte blanche and impunity to massacre people.”</p>
      <p>Unrest in Bolivia first erupted when Morales — the country’s first indigenous president — was accused of rigging the results of October 20 polls to gain re-election for a fourth term.</p>
      <p>He eventually resigned and fled to Mexico after losing the support of Bolivia’s security forces following weeks of protests.</p>
