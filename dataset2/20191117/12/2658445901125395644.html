      <h3>Justina Asishana, Minna</h3>
      <p>Four major roads, Minna-Suleja highway, Minna-Bida, Minna-Munya-Kaduna and Minna-Zungeru-Tegina link the town to the outside world.</p>
      <p>The deplorable condition of these major roads linking Minna town is adversely affecting activities within the ancient town and environ. Four major roads, Minna-Suleja highway, Minna-Bida, Minna-Munya-Kaduna and Minna-Zungeru-Tegina, link the town to the outside world.</p>
      <p>It seems Niger State has the longest federal roads in Nigeria with covers about 1,437 kilometers, spreading across 15, out of the 25 local government areas of the state.</p>
      <p>Out of this, 1,115 kilometers, representing about 80 percent of these trunk ‘A’ roads in the state are in a deplorable condition and this has brought untold hardship to the people with serious effect on their daily economic activities.</p>
      <p>Some of these roads now in complete bad shape are the Jebba-Mokwa Bokani-Tegina-Kagara, connecting Birin Gwari-Kaduna highway, the Rijau through Zuru in Kebbi State, the Katcha Baro- Agaie Lapai-Lambata-Suleja and Rofia-Swete-Segema roads.</p>
      <p>Others are the Wawa-Kaima, Auna-New Bussa, Sarkin pawa-Kaduna section as well as the Pandogari Gurmana-Allawa roads.</p>
      <p>The horrifying state of these roads has become a nightmare to motorists as one would have to embark on a massive prayer session before embarking on a journey on these roads.</p>
      <p>Apart from the bad state of the roads, the continuous traffic gridlock which occurs at the spur of the moment has gradually become something most road users in Niger State dread.</p>
      <p>In Niger State, for example, agony, pains, frustration are the right words that can describe the experience of motorists and commuters plying the major federal roads in the state, especially the Minna-Suleja and other major highways in the state with no respite coming their way.</p>
      <p>While these roads have been manageable for some years, in the past two years, it has gradually become deathtraps.</p>
      <p>The Minna-Suleja road has become the only alternative route for all the trucks, trailers, tankers and other smaller vehicles traveling from north to south and south to north. The road now records carnage on a daily basis. The 98 kilometers Minna -Suleja road is the only road that connects Minna, the state capital with Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and it remains one of the busiest highways in the state with over 500, both private and commercial vehicles, plying the road on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Minna-Suleja road is among the numerous roads, both federal and state highways that have claimed many lives and property worth hundreds of millions of naira lost to different incidents in recent times.</p>
      <p>Statistics from the Niger State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) shows that not less than 147 people have been killed in 361 road traffic crashes in the state from January to September this year, out of which 74 were fatal, 265 were serious and 22 were minor. The report also said 915 people were injured and 147 killed in these road crashes.</p>
      <p>According to FRSC, the number of road safety crashes in the first nine months of the year is almost exceeding the number of road traffic crashes in the entire 2018, adding that 85 percent of the crashes were due to the deplorable condition of these roads.</p>
      <p>The situation is made worst following the activities of trailers, tankers, trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles that have abandoned other roads in the state due to their terrible conditions, and are now using the Bida-Minna-Suleja roads as an alternative route. It is also no longer a new thing for tanker explosions as they have gradually taken over the roads defying government’s orders over the ban of trucks and trailers plying the roads.</p>
      <p>The Minna-Suleja road, which was reconstructed about 25 years ago, is among the numerous federal roads in the state that are described as death traps due to their condition.</p>
      <p>The bad conditions of the roads are having a huge negative impact on the socio-economic activities of the people in the state especially as armed robbers and bandits have taken advantage of the bad roads to lay seige on innocent motorists, kidnapping and robbing them continuously.</p>
      <p>The Tegina-Kontagora and Mokwa-Tegina-Makera-Kaduna highways are examples of such roads. There have been gory stories on how motorists escaped or fell victims on the onslaught of these elements.</p>
      <p>An example of such was when a group of armed robbers, some weeks ago, held motorist traveling along Mokwa-Tegina-Makera-Kaduna highways hostage for several hours, using the bad spots on the roads to carry out their criminal activities.</p>
      <p>On the Minna-Bida road, the journey to Bida, which should take one and a half hours has become a three to four hours journey depending on the speed and ability of the driver to maneuver the potholes and gradually unusable road. A lot of sections of the road have been damaged causing the ride to be unusually rough.</p>
      <p>Some sections of the road are collapsing that if there is no quick intervention, the government will have a herculean task in putting up repairs.</p>
      <p>Car owners now prefer to travel with public transportation because they claim it is much cheaper to use commercial transportation as the maintenance to be done on the car after the trip is often money gulping.</p>
      <p>This year’s rainy season was also described as one of the bad times for motorists plying the road as most parts of the roads collapsed causing the state ministry of health to move in to do temporary repairs on the roads which usually fails after a week or two.</p>
      <p>We gathered that in the past five days, workers and students have had trouble accessing their offices and schools, while motorists leaving and coming into Minna through the Minna-Suleja axis are having hectic time because of its deplorable condition and activities of tankers and trailers drivers.</p>
      <p>For example, a fuel tanker carrying 33,000 liters of petrol almost overturned recently when it was brushed by another fuel tanker opposite the College of Education. This stalled movement of vehicles into and from Minna.</p>
      <p>With the high volume of traffic, dominated by articulated vehicles, getting to Dikko junction from Lambatta is a herculean task as the tankers and trailers have taken over the road and can block the road whenever they want, making it impossible for other vehicles to move.</p>
      <p>Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has always been lamenting over the roads, he has been taking his cries to the federal government which recently paid off with the federal government awarding a contract for the Suleja-Minna road.</p>
      <p>We however observed that the governor has not been very firm with his directive that heavy-duty tankers and trailers should stop plying the road.</p>
