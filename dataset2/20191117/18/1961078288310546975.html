      <h1>Harrison Dillard, World’s Best Hurdler in the 1940s, Dies at 96</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:04:02+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Litsky</a></address>
      <p>Harrison Dillard, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, was considered the world’s best hurdler in the 1940s, setting countless records and winning championships. But his greatest fame resulted from an embarrassing defeat.</p>
      <p>From June 1947 through June 1948, Dillard — who died on Friday in Cleveland at 96 — won 82 consecutive finals, outdoors and indoors, in the high hurdles, low hurdles and sprints. The streak was the longest in track and field history.</p>
      <p>In the 1948 United States Olympic trials in Evanston, Ill., he finished third in the 100-meter dash final and made the Olympic team. But the next day, in the 110-meter hurdles trials, his foot hit four of the first seven hurdles, and his rhythm was destroyed. He stopped running before the eighth hurdle.</p>
      <p>“I was supposed to be a shoo-in,” he said, “but I learned that day that nothing’s ever a sure thing. It was the worst race I ever ran. It was the only time in my life than I didn’t finish a race.”</p>
      <p>In the final of the 100-meter dash at the London Olympics that year, he was expected to finish no higher than fifth. Instead, he won, leading his college coach, Eddie Finnegan, to say: “Fate is strange and wonderful. I’m going out to find a church somewhere.”</p>
      <p>In the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Dillard won the 110-meter high hurdles. He also won gold medals in the 400-meter relay in both Olympics, and his total of four gold medals equaled the four in 1936 by Jesse Owens, his hometown hero in Cleveland. To this day, Dillard is the only man to ever win gold in both hurdles and sprint events.</p>
      <p>Dillard’s death was confirmed to The Associated Press by a friend, Ted Theodore. His wife, Joy, died in 2009. He is survived by a daughter, Terri, and three grandchildren.</p>
      <p>His hurdling career began with childhood ingenuity. “We kids used to take old car seats, burn the fabric off them and then jump over them in the street,” he said.</p>
      <p>When Dillard was 13, he and other neighborhood children watched a parade honoring Owens for his Olympic triumphs.</p>
      <p>As Dillard told it: “Jesse looked down from an open car and said, ‘Hi, boys.’ I ran home. I said, ‘Mama, Mama, I just saw Jesse Owens and I’m going to be just like him.’ She said, ‘Of course you are, son.’ She didn’t take it seriously then, but later, when she saw how much it meant to me, she went out and cleaned other people’s houses and did their laundry and cooked for them so she could buy a little more food to build me up.”</p>
      <p>Five years after Owens had graduated from East Technical High School in Cleveland, Dillard enrolled. That year, Owens gave him a new pair of running shoes. When Dillard failed to make the high school team as a sprinter, Owens urged him to become a hurdler.</p>
      <p>After high school came 32 months in the Army during World War II. When the war had ended, Dillard ran in an Army track meet and won four events. Gen. George S. Patton Jr., a fascinated spectator, called him “the best goddamn athlete I’ve ever seen.”</p>
      <p>After the Army, Dillard entered Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio.</p>
      <p>“The first time I came to New York to race,” he said, “everyone was asking, ‘What is a Baldwin-Wallace?’”</p>
      <p>It was a college with a track cage too small for hurdling, so he did most of his training outdoors. When the snow became too deep, he retreated to the women’s gymnasium, where there was barely room for a 15-yard start, one hurdle and then 15 yards to stop.</p>
      <p>“Having only that one hurdle,” he said, “I learned to start fast and get there ahead of the big guys so their elbows wouldn’t bat me around.”</p>
      <p>He learned so well that he would eventually break 11 world and Olympic records. He once held every world hurdles record outdoors and indoors. He won more than 400 finals in the hurdles and sprints, including 14 United States championships.</p>
      <p>He received the 1955 Sullivan Award as America’s outstanding amateur athlete. He was elected to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1974 and became a charter member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1983.</p>
      <p>He retired in 1993 after working 26 years for the Cleveland Board of Education, mostly as business director. He was a track adviser and spokesman for Mobil, which sponsored the United States outdoor and indoor championships, and once served as a spring training coach for the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians, teaching baseball players how to run.</p>
      <p>He enjoyed being a role model.</p>
      <p>“I have always felt that you present yourself in public as one to be respected and remembered,” he said, “someone people can say about, ‘Here is a human being, a great guy.’”</p>
