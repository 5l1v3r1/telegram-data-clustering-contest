      <h1>Google Maps now speaks place names so you don't have to</h1>

      <p>If you sometimes find yourself repeatedly spelling, or yelling, a destination name to total strangers, fear not, Google Maps’ text-to-speech feature will save you the hassle.</p>
      <p>Communication issues can get in the way of what is supposed to be a relaxing trip. Translation apps or dictionaries do not usually provide names for places, as they are more focused on everyday vocabulary.</p>
      <p>With this feature, currently available for 50 languages and counting, users can simply tap on a speaker button next to the address, and Google Maps will say the name out loud for them.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, Google Maps will also link you to Google Translate, if you wish to continue the conversation. The app will determine whether the translation option is needed based on which language your phone is set to. So, Indonesians will not see a speaker button next to the ‘Monumen Nasional’, for instance.</p>
      <p>Google has recently begun integrating its Translate feature with other services, including Google Home, Google Assistant, Google Lens and more, to the delight of users.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/google-maps-adds-a-new-translation-feature-that-speaks-place-names-out-loud/">TechCrunch</a>, the feature will be available for both iOS and Android users starting this month. (vel/kes)</p>
