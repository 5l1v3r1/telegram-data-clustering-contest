        <figcaption>The stats that have defined Sunderland's season so far</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sam Allardyce arrived at Sunderland in October 2015 knowing he needed to keep his lacking squad in the race until January.</p>
      <p>Back then, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland's</a> race was against relegation from the Premier League and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sam-allardyce">Big Sam</a> knew he'd need reinforcements if he was to achieve the goal of staying up.</p>
      <p>He managed to keep the Black Cats in touching distance, and in came Jan Kirchhoff, Lamine Kone, Wahbi Khazri, and the less remembered Dame N'Doye.</p>
      <p>It worked. The former three excelled and Allardyce's Sunderland went on a run of losing just one of their final 14 games to stay up.</p>
      <p>Fast forward four years and an old friend of his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> is now in the Stadium of Light hotseat - also taking the role in October. Also wishing January was now.</p>
      <p>For Parkinson the goal is different. Now it's League One promotion. But the need for reinforcements in the next transfer window is just as key, and will need to be just as shrewd as Allardyce's were in January 2016.</p>
      <p>Before that though, Parkinson must work with what he's got and get Sunderland to January still in touching distance. Things must improve. He's won just two of his eight games in charge, although his record in the league is two wins and two defeats, with six goals for and just two against.</p>
      <p>They're eight points behind second, although they do have games in hand on most above them. But it's crucial that they pick up enough points between now and January to stay in the race.</p>
      <p>So how does their schedule look? Here's a glance at the upcoming league fixtures up to January 1.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Coventry - home - Saturday, November 23</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a recent run of cup fixtures, Sunderland get back to league action next Saturday when they welcome Coventry in the first of consecutive games at the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>In the league at least, Parkinson is two for two on home soil and will hope to put poor cup showings against Leicester U21s and Gillingham behind him to build some strong league form on Wearside.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Coventry is a tough game though, and they sit one point above Sunderland in the table. They've drawn their last two in the league though and are yet to win away from home this season.</p>
      <p>Still, the midweek trip to Kent for the FA Cup replay with Gillingham before this is hardly ideal preperation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Burton - home - Tuesday, November 26</b>
      </p>
      <p>Midtable again this season, Nigel Clough's side have been very inconsistent.</p>
      <p>They were one of few sides to beat Sunderland last term, but that was on their home turf, not at the Stadium of Light.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That said, they're actually the third best travellers in League One this season, having won three and drawn three in eight games on the road.</p>
      <p>Two tough home games coming up, but both are winnable, and would be big wins for Sunderland too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gillingham - away - Saturday, December 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sunderland already know how well organised Gillingham are under Steve Evans, after their positive showing at the Stadium of Light last week in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>They've already lost half of their home games this season though, and Parkinson will no doubt head to Priestfield Stadium looking for his side to get on the front foot.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For 45 minutes in the FA Cup game Sunderland looked head and shoulders above the visitors but they lost their way after the interval and a Jon McLaughlin error let the visitors back into the game where they were ultimately unlucky not to win it. Fine margins, as Sunderland could and should have been out of sight by then.</p>
      <p>Sunderland's away form is a concern though, and they must find a way to improve that fast.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blackpool - home - Saturday, December 14</b>
      </p>
      <p>With Bury cancelled after the club were thrown out of the league, Blackpool is Sunderland's final opportunity to spread some Christmas cheer.</p>
      <p>Simon Grayson will return to the Stadium of Light and will no doubt have his players fired up for that one.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13847670.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/SGP_NEC_311017GRAYSON03JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>They've looked good this season and are level on points with Sunderland at this stage, albeit having played one game more. They've only lost once on the road too, so it's another tough game for Parkinson's side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bolton - home - Boxing Day</b>
      </p>
      <p>If Parkinson can maintain his home league record between now and January Sunderland will be laughing.</p>
      <p>The Black Cats are at home once again on Boxing Day, hosting Parkinson's former side Bolton.</p>
      <p>He had two great seasons there despite financial difficulties and then couldn't keep them in the Championship last term.</p>
      <p>They just say managed to avoid the fate of Bury this term, but, with a 12 points deduction, have struggled with a squad cobbled together very last minute.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16959736.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Bolton-Wanderers-v-Sunderland-Sky-Bet-League-One.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Sunderland manager Jack Ross<cite>(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They've won their last two and are showing signs of improvement, but Sunderland's draw there earlier in the season was the first major sign things were starting to turn in the wrong way for Ross.</p>
      <p>Parkinson must avoid the same fate and collect all three points.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Doncaster - away - Sunday, December 29</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having made the play-offs with Sunderland last term, Doncaster sold star striker John Marquis to Portsmouth in the summer and have struggled to reach those same heights this term. They sit 12th as things stand.</p>
      <p>The Keepmoat is never an easy place to visit though and they're the joint-fourth best home side in the third tier this term, along with Sunderland and Peterborough. They have lost twice there though, having played twice extra at home than Sunderland so far.</p>
      <p>Away form isn't great for the Black Cats, but that will hopefully change at Gillingham on December 7 and they can then hope to record back-to-back away wins.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fleetwood - away - New Years Day</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16206450.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Fleetwood-Town-v-Sunderland-Sky-Bet-League-One.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Joey Barton<cite>(Image: Sunderland AFC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Added spice to this season's New Years Day fixture with Sunderland travelling to Fleetwood, managed by Joey Barton.</p>
      <p>An impressive summer transfer window has seen them start well and they're above Sunderland currently in fifth.</p>
      <p>Last month Barton suggested Sunderland had run scared of his side when they postponed the scheduled league clash due to international call-ups. Ironically, he then did the exact same for his side's scheduled game at Portsmouth this weekend.</p>
      <p>Parkinson wasn't manager at the time of Barton's comments, but the players were. That team talk should be easy at least, but it's unlikely the game itself will be.</p>
