        <b>A collision blocked two lanes of the M6 southbound carriageway this afternoon causing long tailbacks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident happened around 5.30pm and forced the closure of lanes one and two of the four-lane section between junction 31 (Tickled Trout) and junction 30 at Bamber Bridge.</p>
      <p>Traffic queues stretched back beyond junction 31a for Fulwood and Highways England said at one point the obstruction was causing delays of up to 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>The vehicles involved were quickly moved to the hard shoulder and all lanes were re-opened within 25 minutes. But traffic is expected to be affected for some time.</p>
