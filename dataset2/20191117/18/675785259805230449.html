      <p>A teenage girl was critically injured after she tried to protect her 11-month-old nephew from a machete gang, her family said.</p>
      <p>The 13-year-old suffered serious stab wounds after the gang of men armed with machetes forced their way into a house in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, at about 9.15pm yesterday.</p>
      <p>The teen, hailed by a relative as a hero, is in a critical but stable condition, while the baby was unharmed.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Joyce, who was also injured, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-50452248">BBC</a>: "The baby was unharmed because his auntie is a hero. </p>
      <p>"She's 13-years-old and she threw her whole self over that baby, and she saved his life. She is a hero."</p>
      <p>"It is something that we will never get over."</p>
