      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mmfurrysanctuary/posts/731994960617215">Mun Mun Furry Sanctuary</a> shared onto Facebook on Friday (15 November), reassuring the public that the stray dog was bathed squeaky clean. In their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mmfurrysanctuary/posts/731994960617215">post</a>, they explained that <b>Mr Green (the dog) was rolling over some green powder/dye that some people disposed at the dumpsite</b>. Mr Greenâ€™s innocent fun time at the dumpsite had him well-coated in Hulk green, and netizens FREAKED OUT about it.</p>
      <p>The great news is that <b>he was rescued and the green powder came off with the shampoo</b> when rescuers gave him a bath.</p>

      <p>Yay! This good boi is also healthy and well-fed by the construction workers nearby. Apparently, one of the construction workers (Bocky) actually named the doggo Mr Greeny.</p>

      <p>Weâ€™re beyond happy to hear that Mr Greeny is now safe and sound, and loved by the workers who are taking care of him. It seems like the Grinch wonâ€™t be taking over Christmas this year.</p>

        <i>But also, please dispose of your garbage properly and responsibly. Animals will get hurt scavenging the dumpsite with your toxic trash.</i>
