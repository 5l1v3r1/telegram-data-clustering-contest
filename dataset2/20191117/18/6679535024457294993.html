      <p>The latest report released by <i>The Lancet</i> journal that climate change is potentially damaging the health of the children across the world is cause for serious concern. There may be no greater threat to world’s children than climate change. (Life, “Climate change is harming health of children, says <i>Lancet</i> report,” Nov. 14). This mounting global crisis has the potential to undermine many of the gains we have made in child survival and development. In every crisis, children, due to their physical and cognitive immaturity, are the most vulnerable, and climate change is no exception. When compared with adults, children breathe more air and drink more fluid for their body weight. Also, since children are shorter and spend more time on the ground, they are closer to ground-level pollutants. These factors cause children to have higher exposure levels than adults. As temperatures increase, together with water scarcity and air pollution, children feel the deadliest impact of water-borne diseases and respiratory disorders. As the world experiences a steady rise in climate-driven migration, children’s lives and their future will be the most disrupted. Unless the world acts forcefully to stem the climate crisis now, the danger is bound to escalate.</p>
