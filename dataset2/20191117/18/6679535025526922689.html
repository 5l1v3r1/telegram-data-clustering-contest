      <h1>Kerala start-up finds feet in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh</h1>
      <h2>Over 1,000 Android-based ticketing machines supplied to public transport operators in the two States</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:13:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-P-Praveen-536/" target="_blank">M.P. Praveen</a></address>
      <p>A couple of years ago, a product start-up from Maker Village, the electronic and hardware incubator at Kalamassery, tried out its Android-based ticketing machines in KSRTC buses on an experimental basis.</p>
      <p>Though it never progressed beyond the trial phase, it hardly affected the prospects of the Kerala Startup Mission-supported VST Mobility Solutions. Since then, it has deployed over 1,000 ticketing machine units for PEPSU Road Transport Corporation, the largest bus operator in Punjab, and over 200 units to Lucknow City Transport Services Limited.</p>
      <p>“We have also received enquires from public transport networks in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the Uttar Pradesh Road Transport Corporation, while talks are under way on deployment of our machines for metro services in Lucknow. Having been approved by the Association of State Road Transport Undertakings, we are authorised to engage directly with State-run transport corporations,” said Alvin George, CEO, VST Mobility Solutions.</p>
      <p>Apart from being capable of scanning QR codes and compatible with Near Field Communication cards and various mobile wallets, it is also fit for conductor-less operations where passengers can pay on their own and proceed. It can also do face recognition, which could be used for driver logins. “Network connectivity is not an issue either since it uses embedded SIM that facilitates switching among at least four networks,” said Mr. George.</p>
      <p>The start-up, which employs 74 persons at Maker Village, is also into manufacturing a tracking device enabled by the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, an independent regional navigation satellite system developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is being used to manage a fleet of corporate firms including a Kolkata-based ship builder.</p>
      <h3>Flagship product</h3>
      <p>However, a 4G-enabled Vehicle Infotainment System, which could integrate the services of both the devices and fitted with an embedded SIM and a 128-GB storage space, remains the flagship product of the start-up. It comes with a dual chrome display aiding navigation while also doubling up as a passenger information system.</p>
      <p>“It is capable of sourcing images from not less than six cameras mounted both inside and outside the vehicle. It also serves as on-board diagnostics alerting to the faults of the vehicle. We have received enquiries for the product from Qatar and Albania,” said Mr. George.</p>
      <p>The start-up manufactures all its products at Maker Village and has the capacity to churn out nearly 1,500 units each of the tracking device and infotainment system and 250 units of ticket vending machines a day.</p>
