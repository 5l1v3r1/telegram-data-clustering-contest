      <p>The man behind Frozen character Olaf was inspired by Robin Williams to play the beloved snowman.</p>
      <p>Josh Gad is “keenly aware” of the pressure of a sequel, and feels “100% responsibility” to please franchise fans.</p>
      <p>The star spoke at the London premiere of Frozen 2, released six years after the original hit.</p>

      <p>He revealed his dream was always to play a beloved Disney character, having witnessed Williams as the Genie in Aladdin.</p>
      <p>Gad feels the burden of expectation to get his own character right a second time.</p>
      <p>He said: “Not a day goes by where I don’t pinch myself, where I don’t think this is the craziest thing in the world.</p>
      <p>“I remember seeing the brilliance of seeing Robbie Williams playing the Genie, and I remember saying to my mom, ‘I want to do that one day’.</p>
      <p>“You cut to 25 plus later and I’m not only getting to do it I’m getting to repair this character that I love so much and has clearly connected with so many people of different ages.”</p>
      <p>Gad spoke at the BFI Southbank in London, where Frozen 2 enjoyed its UK premiere.</p>
      <p>He was joined on the red carpet by fellow cast members including Elsa actress Idina Menzel.</p>
      <p>Gad was stunned by the success of the first film, and said he felt a duty to deliver with the sequel.</p>
      <p>He said he felt: “100% responsibility. It was nerve-racking to come into a sequel because the level of expectation and the burden of anticipation that frankly we didn’t have for the first one is something that you’re keenly aware of.”</p>
      <p>Frozen 2 is released in UK cinemas on November 22.</p>
