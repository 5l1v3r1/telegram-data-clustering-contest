      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Davies</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa are in the lower reaches of the Premier League and looking to strengthen their survival credentials as January approaches.</p>
      <p>When the new year comes around, every side in the top flight is likely to be aiming to bolster their ranks for the second half of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at some of the business the teams around <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> in the Premier League table are rumoured to be ready to do come January.</p>
      <h3>Newcastle want Xhaka</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United hope to land Granit Xhaka on loan from Arsenal in January.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sky Sports say Newcastle defender Fabian Schar's friendship with his Swiss international teammate could persuade Xhaka to move north.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has not played for Arsenal since his angry reaction to being booed by fans when he subbed off against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was subsequently stripped of the captaincy and looks set to leave, although Newcastle would have to pay most of his wages.</p>
      <h3>Toney touted for £13m</h3>
      <p>Burnley and Bournemouth are being linked with £13m moves for Peterborough United striker Ian Toney.</p>
      <p>The former Newcastle striker has scored 35 goals in 75 games since joining from Newcastle for just £350,000.</p>
      <p>Posh chairman Darragh MacAntony said: "Toney will break the transfer record for a League One player when he goes. If he goes that is. He'll certainly smash the Posh record.</p>
      <p>"We don't want to lose anyone in January, but you can't guarantee anything in football."</p>

      <h3>Kean tipped for Italy return</h3>
      <p>Moise Kean has reportedly been offered to AC Milan after a nightmare spell at Everton .</p>

      <h3>Top prospect signs new deal</h3>
