      <p>Antoine Griezmann has given an interview to Telefoot in which he looks back on his first few months at Barcelona. The France forward assures that he doesn't regret moving to Camp Nou and asks for patience because he's convinced he will find his best form.</p>
      <p>"Barcelona isn't the easiest place (to play)," Griezmann said. "It's a new squad, a different club, new tactics, a new position and role for me. But it is what it is and I have to work hard."</p>
      <p>Griezmann added that he's convinced he's made the right decision signing for Barça: "I am proud of the decision and of where I am. It will now be hard work which marks everything. Have faith in me and everything else will come on its own.</p>
      <p>"My objective now is to be an important player for the club, to play more minutes, score more goals, give decisive passes, qualify in the Champions League and stay up the top in La Liga. Then, to focus on the national team in March and later the Euros."</p>
      <p>Antoine defined himself as "a player that thinks about the team. I can score goals, but it's not my main objective. My challenge is to help the team however I can."</p>
