      <p>Two of the North East's best known landmarks shone purple on Sunday night to raise awareness of premature birth and the profound impact it has on families.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/millennium-bridge">Gateshead Millennium Bridge</a> and Newcastle’s landmark Tyne Bridge were lit up in honour of World Prematurity Day.</p>
      <p>To raise awareness of this issue, the cross <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/hero-jogger-dived-river-tyne-15202271">Tyne</a> bridges lit up the Quayside skyline purple from dusk on the evening of Sunday November 17.</p>
      <p>The special event was arranged by the Neonatal Unit at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) and the Tiny Lives Trust, a Newcastle-based charity that supports the Neonatal Unit.</p>

      <p>Leading up to the bridge lighting, RVI staff, Tiny Lives staff and families who have been through the RVI Neonatal Unit joined together to walk from Grey’s Monument to Newcastle Quayside - lit with purple glow-sticks and candles - to provide a visual spectacular and raise awareness of premature birth. </p>
      <p>The walk, ‘Tiny Lights for Tiny Lives’, attracted more than 100 people to the city centre.</p>
      <p>Babies born prematurely can face a multitude of challenges, including breathing difficulties, heart problems and compromised immune systems. Time on the Neonatal Unit can often be one of the most difficult periods a family will ever face, with babies spending weeks or even months in hospital as they fight to survive, grow and thrive.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, RVI Tiny Lives shared the story of couple Dana and Craig and their twins, Danu and Teddi, born at 25 weeks.</p>

      <p>Danu, who was one pound and eight ounces when she was born, has just turned one and is thriving, Teddi sadly passed away on the Unit.</p>
      <p>Dana said: "I had a massive bleed and went into labour.</p>

      <p>"The girls were taken to SCBU and we thought Danu wouldn't make it. She was the sickest baby on the unit at that point. That's why she's such a miracle.</p>
      <p>"Teddi had a massive brain haemorrhage and we made the decision to turn the life support off.</p>
      <p>"The nurses were amazing - they did hand and footprints for Teddi, and all sorts of things so the boys had that, memories of their sister.</p>
      <p>"Danu's doing great now - she's the noisiest child in the house. You'd never be able to tell the journey she's come on. She's just a delight."</p>
