      <p>Two of the best tight ends in modern NFL history are Rob Gronkowski and Rob Gronkowski. One is retired and the other came out of retirement to go play again.</p>
      <p>We had a bit of tight end on tight end crime on Sunday morning when Gronk, who appears on the Fox pregame show these days, took a subtle shot at the Dallas Cowboys tight end by stating the team could use a tight end like himself.</p>

      <p>The 37-year-old Witten has caught just 36 passes for 338 yards and two touchdowns in nine games.</p>
      <p>Gronk stated on Saturday that he has a big announcement coming on Tuesday that is likely to state his future in either the NFL or WWE, or possibly more CBD related products.</p>
