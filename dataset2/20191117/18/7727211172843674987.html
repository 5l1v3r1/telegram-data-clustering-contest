      <h1>Met Office has something to say about reports of a polar vortex</h1>
      <h2>Some reports suggest Merseyside should be braced for plunging temperatures and freezing fog</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:04:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Some reports are suggesting the UK is headed for a 'polar vortex' which will bring plunging temperatures and overnight freezes.</p>
      <p>Parts of Britain are supposedly expected to hit -5°C with other severe conditions like freezing fog and snow on the way.</p>
      <p>But, what does the national <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> service, the Met Office, have to say about such claims?</p>
      <p>Well, there are currently no weather warnings in place for the whole of the country, and in fact, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool">Merseyside</a> is expected to enjoy quite a mild and dry week.</p>

      <p>While temperatures will drop over night, that is to be expected in November. In Liverpool and the surrounding area, we could see lows of 1°C, but it could feel like -3°C because of the wind chill.</p>
      <p>However, that is only during the early hours and the rest of the week is forecast to be cloudy, but dry with good visibility levels and highs of a 9°C on Friday.</p>

      <p>Even the Met Office's long range forecast for the region predicts higher then usual temperatures.</p>
      <p>The Met Office said: "It will turn milder than as of late, but it may feel cooler in some stronger winds that accompany any spells of rain.</p>
      <p>"The west and northwest will likely see the best of any drier and more settled weather conditions. There is an above average risk of overnight fog forming in any clearer spells overnight, which could be slow to clear in places.</p>
      <p>"The showers may continue to be wintry over the highest ground bringing some sleet or snow at times. Temperatures are expected to be around average or perhaps slightly milder for the time of year."</p>
      <h3>What is the polar vortex?</h3>
      <p>The polar vortex is a circulation of winds high up in the stratosphere, up to 30 miles above the earth.</p>
      <p>It is present in winter and is not a new phenomenon, scientists have known about it for many years.</p>
      <p>The winds regularly exceed 155 miles per hour – the strength of the winds in the strongest hurricanes.</p>
      <p>During the winter it can strengthen and weaken. These changes have an influence lower down in the atmosphere and ultimately on our weather.</p>
