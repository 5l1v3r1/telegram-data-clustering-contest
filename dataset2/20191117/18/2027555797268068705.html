      <h1>S Africa unions threaten to 'shut down' aviation sector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:08:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p> South African unions on Sunday called on all aviation workers to join striking South African Airways (SAA) staff after the cash-strapped airline failed to meet their demands.</p>
      <p>The country's embattled flag carrier has been losing 52 million rand (USD 3.5 million) per day since more than 3,000 workers started an open-ended strike on Friday -- forcing the airline to cancel hundreds of flights.</p>
      <p>Talks with unions ended without resolution on Saturday, prompting threats of further action.</p>
      <p>"In response to this deliberate provocation by the SAA board and its executive management, (the) NUMSA (metalworkers' union) is in the process of consulting workers for a secondary strike in aviation," NUMSA spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola told reporters in front of the SAA headquarters in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>Unions first threatened to strike after SAA announced this week that almost 1,000 employees could lose their jobs as part of a restructuring process.</p>
      <p>Talks with management deadlocked after they failed to agree on wage hikes, prompting unions to press on with their threats.</p>
      <p>SAA is offering a 5.9 percent pay rise, while unions are demanding an eight percent across-the-board hike and a three-year guarantee of job security.</p>
      <p>"We are fighting against retrenchment, corruption and privatisation," said Hlubi-Majola, speaking at a media briefing broadcast on local television.</p>
      <p>She told journalists discussions with SAA subsidiaries, South Africa's airport management company and airline service providers were underway.</p>
      <p>"The secondary strike will have the impact of shutting down the entire aviation sector," said Hlubi-Majola.</p>
      <p>SAA did not immediately respond to AFP's requests for comment.</p>
      <p>The company -- one of the biggest airlines in Africa -- is deep in debt and has not posted a profit since 2011, despite several government bailouts.</p>
