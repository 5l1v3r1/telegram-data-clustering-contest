      <p>The victim‚Äôs 40-year-old mother lodged a police report at 3:30 pm on 15 November (the day when the victim was raped), and the police chief of Tawau district, Peter Umbuas <b>confirmed that there was indeed a rape case that occurred in a secondary school on Friday</b>. Therefore, the seven boys were detained and set to be remanded for three days.</p>
      <p>The Form Two girl was then sent to the district hospital for a medical check-up, as reported on <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/17/seven-tawau-teens-accused-of-rape-allowed-bail-to-sit-for-spm">The Star</a>.</p>
      <p>Since today is the third day of the remand, an update was released by the police, announcing that <b>the seven suspects have been allowed bail because ‚Äúthe case has been solved‚Äù and they are apprehended</b>. The police decided not to extend their three-day remand, and they would resume collecting evidence for this case before proceeding with charges in court.</p>
