      <p><b>Among the many uncertainties of life, Marc Marquez undoubtedly represents a certainty.</b> Seeing him triumph is a habit by now. We just have to see how. Today, #93 built his success, his twelfth of the season, putting a tenth of a second between himself and his opponents, giving Honda the last possible title, the team championship. <b>Marc achieved the so-called "triple crown", putting the icing on his beautiful cake.</b></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Between the twelfth victory and the triple crown<b>, the second gives me more satisfaction, since that was what the whole team wanted and asked for</b>. I wanted to do my best to reach that goal, and I'm happy that now it's a reality, both for Honda and for all the sponsors."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Marc's season is hard to define in one word, unless that word is <b>"perfect".</b></p>
      <p>
        <i>"<b>It's been</b> <b>an incredible year. I think it'll be difficult to equal or even improve. </b>I don't like using the word "impossible", but the consistency shown was important. There were riders that were faster than me in some races, but consistency was the winning weapon."</i>
      </p>
      <p>A year of victories and growth in which <b>Marquez says he understood something really important.</b></p>
      <p>
        <i><b>"I learned to look at things with realism, without pretense, this year. </b>If you don't have the potential to win in a race, you have to accept it and get the most you can. I talk a lot with Alzamora and Hernandez, even if the last decision is up to me. In some races like Phillip Island or Buriram, I fought to win because I knew it was the right strategy."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Obviously, Marc didn't create this all on his own, and <b>he himself tells us about the magic that flows inside his garage.<i> </i></b><i>"I really like the balance we found. <b>There's Santi </b></i>(ed. Hernandez)<i><b> who is very impartial, Alberto </b></i>(ed. Puig)<i><b> who always wants the best, and Emilio </b></i>(ed. Alzamora)<i><b> who is more prudent.</b> A good compromise was created that psychs me a bit and also calms me."</i></p>
      <p>Changing the subject, we obviously need <b>to talk about the race, </b>and the strategy used by #93 who, unlike in other races, took the lead right away, and remained there.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"The front tire was medium, although rather soft to be a medium, and I was afraid I'd wear out the rear. <b>The strategy today was to get ahead as quickly as possible, </b>even if I wasn't as fast as in other races. When Fabio was at six tenths, I decided to push all the way."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Fabio Quartararo was behind the world champion<b>, </b>as usual. Marc still considers him to be one of the candidates for the 2020 title.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>“I think Fabio is the fastest rider in terms of pure speed,</b> and I think that he was the second rider in terms of points earned in the second part of the season. I certainly believe that <b>he'll be one of the candidates for the title next year</b>. He'll have an official bike and this will certainly help as compared to this season."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Finally,<b> it's impossible for Marc not to talk about his future teammate, </b>seeing his brother, Alex, as the favorite, fresh from the Moto2 title.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Each rider must deserve his place. <b>I only know that the candidates are an Englishman, a Frenchman, and the Moto2 world champion.</b> It'll be interesting to know who it'll be, but I won't change my mind. The objective remains the same, and your first opponent is always your teammate."</i>
