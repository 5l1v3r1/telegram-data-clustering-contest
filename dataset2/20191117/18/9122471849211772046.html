      <h1>Video: Refs Make Disastrous Call In Ravens-Texans Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:48:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The NFL implemented a new rule this year allowing coaches to challenge pass interference calls. But to say that the new rule has been even somewhat useful might be kind at this point.</p>
      <p>Early in today’s Ravens-Texans game, Texans WR DeAndre Hopkins ran towards the end zone with his eye on the ball floating in his direction as a Ravens defender covered him tightly.</p>
      <p>The Ravens player pulled hard on Hopkins to prevent him from making a play on the ball and it went incomplete. No flag was thrown.</p>
      <p>Houston then challenged the play and everyone could see that Hopkins was tugged on in the end zone. But there was still no flag.</p>
      <p>The Texans ultimately got no points on the drive.</p>

      <p>The rule to allow coaches to challenge PI calls was implemented following backlash to a highly-controversial non-PI call in last year’s NFC Championship Game that earned national attention.</p>
      <p>But it appears that not even giving officials an opportunity to review plays in question is resulting in the adjustments to plays that the game needs.</p>
      <p>And you can bet your bottom dollar that this new rule will play a big role in determining the outcome of an important regular season or playoff game eventually.</p>
      <p>We can’t wait…</p>
