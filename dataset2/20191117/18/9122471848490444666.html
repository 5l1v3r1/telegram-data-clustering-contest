      <h1>Urban Meyer Reacts To Texas’ Brutal Loss vs. Iowa State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:22:19+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Texas’ 23-21 loss to Iowa State dropped the Longhorns to 6-4 on the season. What was once thought to be a potential breakout campaign for the program has been wildly disappointing.</p>
      <p>Texas has lost three times in Big 12 play, including yesterday when a costly offsides penalty on Iowa State’s final drive allowed the Cyclones to run the clock down before converting a game-winning field goal as time expired.</p>
      <p>After the game, perhaps the most damning analysis came form Urban Meyer on Fox Sports’ post-game show. Meyer, who employed Texas head coach Tom Herman as his offensive coordinator at Ohio State, summed up what might be the most frustrating part about the loss for UT fans.</p>
      <p>Simply put, it wasn’t a surprise.</p>
      <blockquote>“There was a time when a game like that would have been a ‘stop the presses’ upset,” Meyer said, <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/brady-quinn-urban-meyer-critical-of-tom-herman-after-texas-iowa-state-game-138745523/">via 247Sports</a>. “It wasn’t (today). Iowa State was picked to win. You watched the game, and Iowa State may have been the better team. Texas … they’re recruiting well. A little bit like (Michigan), you might need to look under the hood and find out what’s going on, because (that ending) shouldn’t happen.”</blockquote>
      <p>With four losses and only two regular season games left, plus a bowl game, it looks like this will be the ninth time in 10 seasons that Texas will fail to win 10 games. The Longhorns went 10-4 last season, including a Sugar Bowl win over Georgia.</p>
      <p>From 2001-09, Texas won at least 10 games every year. Getting back to that level has been a struggle for the last decade.</p>
