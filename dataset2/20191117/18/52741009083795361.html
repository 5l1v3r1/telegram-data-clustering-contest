      <h1>Get 'Wrapped in Courage' to support women's crisis services in Waterloo Region</h1>
      <h2>The campaign, which is selling purple scarves, aims to spread awareness about domestic abuse and provide support for women in abusive situations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ariel Deutschmann</a></address>
      <p>Wearing a purple scarf this month will keep away more than a winter chill, as a new social awareness campaign aims to support women affected by domestic abuse. </p>
      <p>Jennifer Hutton is the CEO of Women's Crisis Services in Waterloo Region.</p>
      <p>She says the organization will sell purple 'Wrapped in Courage' scarves during November for Women Abuse Prevention month.</p>
      <p>"The idea is that we really want to wrap Waterloo Region in purple to signify all the support that our community is showing for a woman who needs to make different decisions and live a safer life and just to demonstrate their support and show her that she's really not alone." says Hutton on the Mike Farwell Show on 570 NEWS.</p>
      <p>Hutton says violence against women is not a one-off problem, as the number of calls reporting domestic violence is high within this Region.</p>
      <p>"Waterloo Regional police are getting about 6,000 service calls a year, domestic violence service calls, and that's our Region alone." says Hutton, "We have ninety beds between Anselma House and Haven, and they're almost full every night."</p>
      <p>"It's a global problem, it's a national problem and it's very much a problem in our community as well." </p>
      <p>By purchasing a scarf and posting a photo online wearing it, Hutton says residents signify their support to women in abusive situations who are looking to leave.</p>
      <p>"These purple scarves really signify the courage that it takes a woman to leave an abusive relationship, and we know that she cannot do that on her own." says Hutton.</p>
      <p>Your support, she says, can help them decide to seek a safer life.</p>
      <p>"It's huge. Too often I think what keeps women in these situations where they're unsafe and keeps them from speaking up is really that shame or that embarrassment." says Hutton, "I think when others see people wearing purple, I think it normalizes it." </p>
      <p>"That's why we're asking everyone to consider purchasing a purple scarf from us." says Hutton, "Wearing that and showing themselves on social media wearing their purple scarves, really demonstrate their support and show women that they're not alone, because they really can't do it without your support." </p>
      <p>Each purple scarf costs $15, and Hutton says there are plenty of them left for residents to purchase.</p>
      <p>"We've sold about a 165 scarves, but we still have a goal of wanting to sell 175 scarves to a 180 scarves." says Hutton. </p>
      <p>Besides the purple scarves, Hutton says the '#SheIsYourNeighbour' book is still available for purchase.</p>
      <p>The Women's Crisis Services of Waterloo Region provides safe shelter for more than 500 people, and outreach services to around 900 women.</p>
