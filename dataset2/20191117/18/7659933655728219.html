      <p>Tunisia's next government should focus on reforming the faltering economy and restoring hope among frustrated youth, Prime Minister designate Habib Jemli said on Sunday.<br/><br/>Jemli faces the challenge of creating a ruling coalition after Ennahda party, which took most seats in last month's parliamentary election, tapped him as prime minister on Friday.<br/><br/>"Tunisians were patient enough and the youth are frustrated. It is time they can see hope and light at the end of the tunnel,‚Äù he said.<br/><br/>Priorities will be to combat price inflation and to improve Tunisians' living conditions and public services.<br/><br/>Jemli will start on Monday consultations with political parties to discuss the government program and to choose ministers. He expects this to take weeks.<br/><br/>Any new government will need the support of at least two other parties to command even the minimum parliamentary majority of 109 seats needed to pass legislation.<br/><br/>If Jemli cannot form a government within two months, President Kais Saied can ask another to try. If that fails and the deadlock persists, there will be another election.<br/><br/>"Instead of political disputes over positions and chairs, emphasis should be placed on economic reforms including reforms of state firms facing major difficulties," the PM-designate said.</p>
