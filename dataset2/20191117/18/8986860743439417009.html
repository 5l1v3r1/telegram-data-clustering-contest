      <p>While the “Ololo” hitmaker was performing his hit song dubbed “Hero” on stage, he approached Shatta Wale as they dance along.</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy also gave Shatta Wale a hearty hug as a form of appreciation after he (Shatta) gifted his “Best Video” award to him.</p>
      <p>It’s obvious the beef between these two ‘big’ artists is over as they always express their love for each other at almost every occasion</p>
