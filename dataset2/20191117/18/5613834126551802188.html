      <h1>Bend Studio Wants to Expand ‘Days Gone’ Universe, Including a Sequel?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:23:34+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Sony and Bend Studio’s open-world zombie epic <b><i>Days Gone</i></b> impressed enough fans to earn them <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3594363/resident-evil-2-days-gone-win-big-golden-joystick-awards/">a couple of awards with The Golden Joysticks</a>, despite not being what it could have been. Still, Bend Studio are working to give more to fans, including a possible sequel.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/days-gone-2-sequel-tease/">GamesRadar</a>, Bend Studio’s Chris Reese shared a bit more insight on the studio’s outlook on <i>Days Gone</i> after its release. When asked about the potential to expand on the game’s universe down the line, Reese responded that “it is certainly a passion of ours, and that’s what we’ve always wanted to do. This is a world that we want to keep breathing more life into, and explore many, many different avenues. So who knows, we’ll see!”</p>
      <p>Currently, Bend are in pre-production for their next title, though for obvious reasons, the nature of which hasn’t been revealed. Still, Reese said he was grateful for the response from the community for the game, as well as the recognition for the studios’ efforts in their awards. After all, <i>Days Gone</i> is still the biggest PlayStation 4 exclusive release this year (<a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3593753/death-stranding-second-biggest-ps4-title-launch-year/">holding out over the recently-released <b><i>Death Stranding</i></b></a>). “It’s awesome, because there was so much dedication and hard work from the team, and this is kind of the final payoff for that. To see the players actually engage with the game and really enjoy the passion that we put into it, to see that come back, it’s awe inspiring.”</p>
