      <h1>I'm A Celebrity Power Pairs explained and the luxury perks they can win</h1>
      <h2>The ITV show launches tonight and there are a lot of shake-ups - including the celebrities having to partner up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:03:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>The 2019 series of  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here</a> launches tonight at it will see the stars having to partner up to become the strongest couples.</p>
      <p>The aim of the partnerships are to form the strongest duo in order to be able to ditch the bug ridden camp to win a spot in a luxury area.</p>
      <p>We have seen celebs battle it out in previous series to get special bonuses and extras to make their stay more VIP but this year with double the power going head to head we could see the most competitive season yet.</p>
      <p>The celebrities facing the Bushtucker trials this year are: former Olympian and reality star and transgender icon Caitlyn Jenner, former Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa, Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway, Radio presenter Roman Kemp, former  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a>  star Adele Roberts, comedian Andrew Maxwell, Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson, former rugby player James Haskell, and former footballer Ian Wright.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>However, we are sure there is the potential for some late additions too.</p>
      <p>All 10 celebrities will meet for the first time in scenes airing tonight, with half arriving by super car and stepping onto the luxury yacht moored off Australia's Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the other five will arrive by speedboat and make their way to the beach.</p>
      <p>Those on the yacht will immediately be taken to task as they have to race to swim to shore and get the chance to pair up with who they want on the beach.</p>

      <p>Once teamed up, the pairs have the chance to become one of the two Power Pairs who will be able to enjoy special privileges.</p>
      <p>Each of the pairings is given one of three routes to camp - planks, skydive or a canoe which is sure to showcase which duos are a match made in heaven and others that are incompatible during tricky times.</p>
      <p>Although it is not yet known what special treatment the strongest pairs will get, looking back at previous series gives a good idea of what can be in store for the lucky stars.</p>
      <p>In former seasons we have seen winning teams being awarded their favourite food and drinks as well as soft pillows, comfortable beds and private sleeping areas.</p>

      <p>With photos emerging ahead of filming of a hot tub being built we can speculate that this could be a special luxury for a winning power pair.</p>
      <p>No doubt the contestants will give it all they can for a chance to make their time in the outback more bearable and as hunger kicks in, stress levels rise and bug bites get the best of the celebs  we could see a lot of drama around the campfire.</p>
      <p>* <b>I’m A Celebrity starts tonight at 9pm on ITV.</b></p>
