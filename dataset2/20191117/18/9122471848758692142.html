      <h1>Colin Kaepernick Getting Criticized For T-Shirt Choice At NFL Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:17:33+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick is facing some criticism for an interesting T-shirt choice at his workout for NFL teams in the Atlanta, Georgia area on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The former NFL quarterback, who’s been out of the league since 2016 after kneeling during the national anthem, wore a “Kunta Kinte” shirt to his workout, held at a local high school.</p>
      <p>Kunta Kinte is a character in the 1976 novel <i>Roots: The Saga of an American Family</i> by American author Alex Haley. Kinte was an African native, taken to America as a slave.</p>
      <p>The character has since been referenced in some prominent films, including <i>Coming to America</i>. He was also one of the main characters in the <i>Roots </i>miniseries.</p>

      <p>Some believe Kaepernick should not have worn this shirt to his NFL workout.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick, meanwhile, issued a strong message to reporters following his workout.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready for three years,” Kaepernick said. “I’ve been denied for three years. We all know why. I came out here and showed it today in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. So we’re waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running — stop running from the truth, stop running from the people.”</p>
      <p>There were reportedly eight teams in attendance at Kaepernick’s workout on Saturday, which was moved from the Falcons’ facility to a high school about 60 miles away. Several NFL teams didn’t show up to the workout following the location change.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick reportedly impressed scouts with his arm strength during his workout, though it remains to be seen if anyone is seriously considering signing him.</p>
