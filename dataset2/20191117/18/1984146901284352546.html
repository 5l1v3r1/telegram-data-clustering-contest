      <p>It’s hard to believe that Westlife have now been around for 20 years but it’s true.</p>
      <p>The Irish lads first burst onto the scene back in 1999, with their debut single Swear It Again, which earned them their first number 1.</p>
      <p>That paved the way for a record number of UK number 1s, with the likes of Flying Without Wings, Fool Again, Queen of My Heart, World of Our Own and You Raise Me Up all following suit.</p>
      <p>This year, Shane, Mark, Nicky and Kian came back in a big way with new single Hello My Love and then embarked on their most successful tour to date, which saw them sell out venues all over the country,</p>
      <p>The group have just released their new album Spectrum, which also includes tracks likes Better Man and My Blood.</p>
      <p>The now foursome appeared on Sunday night’s <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> results show where they performed a greatest hits medley.</p>
      <h3>How old are Westlife now?</h3>
      <p>Shane Filan is 40, Mark Feehily is 39, Nicky Byrne is 41 and Kian Egan is 39.</p>
      <p>They will embark on their massive Stadiums in the Summer tour next year, with tickets available <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/westlife?int_cmp_name=Westlife&amp;int_cmp_id=UK-Home-601&amp;int_cmp_creative=Home-main-2&amp;tm_link=tm_ccp_Home_main_Westlife">online now from Ticketmaster.</a></p>
      <p>The newly announced dates follow the news of a sell-out show at Wembley.</p>
