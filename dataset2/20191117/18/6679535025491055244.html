      <p>The Shiv Sena might be brimming with hope that it would soon have its Chief Minister in place in Maharashtra and that a government led by it with its new-found allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, is on the verge of assuming office in the state, but the situation still remains fluid with more twists and turns in store. (“Sena confident of CM’s post, will skip NDA meet,” Nov. 17). With the NCP not insisting on the CM’s post and with the Congress still vacillating on whether to join the government or to provide outside support to a Sena-NCP government, it is advantage Sena at least as far as the CM’s post is concerned. Strangely, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), despite being aware of all these developments, is still nursing a feeling that it is in contention for forming the government. No less a person than the State BJP president Chandrakant Pandit has waxed eloquent that the BJP is all set for a second term in office and that Devendra Fadnavis will occupy the CM’s chair. This has sparked fears in the Sena, NCP and Congress camps as to whether the BJP will be launching an ‘Operation Lotus’ in Maharashtra to wean away legislators from the Opposition parties. The cancellation of a scheduled meeting of the three parties with the Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari clearly indicates that the parties are yet to reach a final consensus on issues. This delay could work out to the advantage of the BJP if it has any poaching plans in its arsenal.</p>
