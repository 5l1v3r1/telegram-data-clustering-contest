      <p>Police visited an address on Main Road, Woolverstone, shortly after 11am for an unrelated matter when they discovered a hand grenade.</p>
      <p>Army bomb disposal officers from Colchester were called to attend the scene at 1.15pm and were able to confirm the explosive was not live.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Suffolk police said: "We received information that the grenade was inert but this could not be confirmed so therefore the bomb squad were called.</p>
      <p>"On arrival, they confirmed it was not a live grenade."</p>
      <p>The spokesman added that the grenade was described as being similar to a World War Two device.</p>
      <p>Bomb disposal officers took the grenade away with them when they left the scene.</p>
