      <p>Amid public concern, prices of onions have slightly dropped in retail and wholesale markets across the country as a locally grown variety of the cooking ingredient started hitting the market.</p>
      <p>Price of different varieties of onion fell by Tk 30-40 both in retail and wholesale markets in the capital.</p>
      <p>Visiting markets in the capital’s Karwanbazar, Mirpur, and Shyambazar, The Daily Star correspondent yesterday found that the local onions were being sold at Tk 200-220 per kg, onions imported from Myanmar at Tk 170-190 per kg, and onions imported from Egypt at Tk 150-180 per kg.</p>
      <p>The same varieties were sold between Tk 200 to Tk 250 in these markets the previous day.</p>
      <p>In Chattogram, onion prices dropped by Tk 15-20 in wholesale and retail markets.</p>
      <p>Myanmarese onions were being sold at Tk 180 per kg at Kazir Deuri kitchen market. The same variant was sold for Tk 200 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Pabna, prices of onion have dropped by Tk 3,000–4,000 per maund (about 37.5kg) after farmers began harvesting Mulakata, a locally grown variety of the bulb, at least a month before schedule.</p>
      <p>Amid soaring price of onions, farmers started reaping the bulb ahead of schedule to maximize profit, reports our correspondent in Pabna, one of the largest onion producing districts in the country.</p>
      <p>“I’ve grown onions in 12 bighas of land this year. Since the price is high, I’ve harvested from a portion of the land and sold them to the wholesalers for Tk 5,000 per maund,” said Abdul Alim, a farmer of Dhulauri village in Pabna’s Santhia upazila.</p>
      <p>Munnaf Pramanik, an onion trader at Santhia Wholesale market, said, “Each mound of onion was sold at Tk 8,000 to Tk 9,000 last week…The price dropped after the arrival of new onions.”</p>
      <p>The scenario is similar in Jashore where onions are cultivated on about 1,500 hectares of land.</p>

      <p>Mehedi Hasan, a farmer of Jashore’s Chowgachha upazila, said they were reaping immature onions since the market price was high.</p>
      <p>Emdad Hossain, an official of the District Agriculture Extension Department in Jessore, said they had suggested the farmers not to pick the immature onion as the bulbs were supposed to get matured in early December.</p>
      <p>In Rajshahi, onion prices dropped to Tk 150 from Tk 250 a day earlier following a joint operation led by the district administration, reports our correspondent there.</p>
      <p>Onion prices began to rise across the country about two months ago when the Indian government imposed a ban on onion export.</p>
      <p>But the prices started to rise sharply since last week.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, each kg of locally grown onion was sold at Tk 100-120 in the capital’s kitchen markets.</p>
      <p>But the price jumped to Tk 160 on Tuesday morning and then kept rising.</p>
      <p>The prices rose by Tk 30 to 40 every day since Wednesday.</p>
