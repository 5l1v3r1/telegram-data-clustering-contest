      <h1>The unique neighbourhood church changing the lives of the city's most vulnerable residents</h1>
      <h2>St. Bride's is a unique church in Liverpool - and has embraced a way of 'doing things differently'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lisa-rand/" target="_blank">Lisa Rand</a></address>
      <p>St Bride's Church in Liverpool's Georgian Quarter is unique in the city not just as the only surviving example in the city of a 19th century Neoclassical church - but also because of its open and inclusive approach, which has helped the church buck the trend of decline to an extraordinary extent over the past 15 years.  </p>
      <p>The grade II* listed building stands out as a landmark amidst the remarkable architecture of Percy Street in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/toxteth">Liverpool 8</a> and is also a beacon of hope for local residents who make use of the many services provided by partner organisations at the church.</p>

      <p>In this era of cuts to vital public services, foodbanks, food kitchens, support for refugees and asylum seekers, as well as LGBT-friendly church services, music and arts events are all part of the offering at St. Bride's.</p>
      <p>It is rare to find a day when there aren't dozens of local residents milling around - a far cry from its low point in 2005 when there was a congregation of just five and St. Bride's was seriously considering closing its doors for good.</p>
      <p>A raft of repair issues has meant that the building is considered one of the most "at risk" in Liverpool by Heritage England, and a series of unsuccessful funding bids has meant that the structure continues to be at high risk of further deterioration due to ongoing problems with the roof.</p>

      <p>Emergency repairs were carried out eight years ago to prevent further decay of the structure from water damage, but the building has been plagued for years by dry rot and issues with the roof and drains.</p>
      <p>Yet, the congregation and visitors to St. Bride's remain stoical in the face of the challenges of the building's fabric -  and there are currently around 600 people a week who go through the centre's doors.</p>

      <p>Many people attending St. Bride's receive vital support, including the 200 people each week who visit MICAH Liverpool, a project run by Liverpool Cathedral, Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King and St Bride’s, and which offer a weekly foodbank at the church, one of the few in the city where people can self refer, and for which there are often queues around the building at opening time.</p>
      <p>Roger Smalley's Homeless Project provides meals every Thursday evening to Liverpool's homeless population and the refugee and asylum seeker support programmes by the Red Cross and Refugee Women Connect are also hugely popular and offer crucial services to some of the city's most vulnerable residents.</p>

      <p>Warren Hartley, Ministry Facilitator with Open Table, who run twice monthly services at St. Bride's which welcome Liverpool's LGBTQIA community to inclusive worship said: "We all have a passion for social justice here and it's an incredibly diverse community."</p>
      <p>"What's lovely is the way that the religious aspects of St. Bride's and the secular elements go hand in hand.  It's great how people gather in the community here and come together to help each other."</p>
      <p>Church administrator Jackie Corcoran said: "It's an amazing social support hub.  The groups we support are partners and their work is vital in the local community."</p>

      <p>In 2005 when the building was at risk of imminent closure, there were just five members of the congregation attending services and the local diocese of the Church of England were considered removing funding for a vicar.</p>
      <p>Instead of closing St. Bride's, the Church of England instead decided to provide funding for five years under the proviso that the church found a way to "do things differently"  and they haven't looked back since.</p>
      <p>There was a local consultation to find out what was important to the neighbouring community, and from that emerged St. Bride's new mission statement, with the three central principles of "Progressive, Creative and Inclusive."</p>
      <p>Since the relaunch of the church, a strong and vibrant community has developed at St. Bride's.</p>

      <p>Every Friday the Red Cross provide a meeting point for refugees and asylum seekers, staffed by volunteers who help to talk people through access to services and support with the trauma and adversity that many attendees have to deal with.</p>
      <p>There is also a weekly women's only refugee support group called Refugee Women Connect who help vulnerable women find support and services to help them settle in the city.</p>
      <p>Many other services and events have taken place at the church in recent years, ranging from HIV testing clinics to art exhibitions, family fun days and summer fairs.</p>
      <p>As well as the weekly Church of England services taking place at St. Brides, twice a month there are services as part of Open Table, an organisation that welcomes LGBTQIA people of faith into the church for ceremonies that are inclusive and open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Minister Warren Hartley said: "So many people have had experiences of being rejected by church so to find somewhere to be included is an extraordinary experience to many."</p>
      <p>Administrator Jackie Corcoran is a keen musician, and part of the hospitality the church offers is to give home to several community choirs - including IChoir, which works for mental health wellness and the Liverpool Socialist Singers, who make use of the space to rehearse.</p>

      <p>Jackie said: "Music is hugely important to us here at St. Brides.  We have events on across the year that make use of the amazing acoustics of the building. </p>
      <p>"Recently we had a pop-up cafe which featured the wonderful Asylum Link Choir and music from Daniel Eghbalipourik, who competed on Britain's Got Talent.  I am also part of Out of the Blue Jazz Trio.  We have also held Jazz Mass in the past, which was very popular."</p>

      <p>With so many organisations making use of St. Brides, its transformation from near empty church to vibrant neighbourhood hub has been a remarkable measure of the power of people coming together to make a change.</p>
      <p>As Jackie says: "It's about love - of the people for the people - that's what makes our community."</p>
