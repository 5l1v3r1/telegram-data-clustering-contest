      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:44:41+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Roy Keane has warned <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> that they will "suffer" against better teams if they fail to improve out of possession.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions took a 1-0 lead into half-time of their final Euro 2020 qualification match at Kosovo on Sunday night - but were criticised for their levels of intensity.</p>
      <p>England were pulled up for a 'half-press' where they began putting pressure on the ball but did not get there, instead causing gaps to be left elsewhere on the field, giving Kosovo job.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend Keane, who was acting as pundit for ITV, believes that Gareth Southgate's halfway-house approach will cost them dear if they come up against better opposition.</p>
      <p>Keane said: "It is just bad habits from players in international games where there isn't much at stake, because we have seen it in too many games.</p>

      <p>"I keep repeating myself, but against better opposition, they will suffer for it."</p>
      <p>Keane was responding to analysis from Dixon, in which the former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> man said: "I am always looking for things that have gone wrong in previous games and have they improved in those areas.</p>
      <p>"This is them pressing and getting hit on the break. It is a half-press; they never really get there.</p>

      <p>"If you do this against good teams, you will end up in a position like this, five v four at the back. You cannot afford against a good side to get five vs four at the back.</p>
      <p>"Sterling doesn't catch him but he quite easily could have caught him and caused a penalty.</p>
      <p>"It is something about being caught on the break, being caught on the ball, against the better teams you are going to get hurt.</p>
