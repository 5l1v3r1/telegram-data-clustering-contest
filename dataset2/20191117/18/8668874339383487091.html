      <h1>Champions Cup XV of the Week - Round 1</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:41:17+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Shaw</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://index.rugbypass.com/rpi/european-champions-cup/all/all/7-days/high-to-low/teams/">Heineken Champions Cup</a> returned this weekend to wake the northern hemisphere from its post-Rugby World Cup blues, and we have compiled our XV of the week from an entertaining opening round.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> focusing their attentions elsewhere, English clubs <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/its-put-up-or-shut-up-time-for-premiership-clubs-in-champions-cup">continued to struggle in Europe</a>, with Exeter <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> the notable exception, as they notched up a highly impressive 31-12 win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/la-rochelle">La Rochelle</a> on France’s Atlantic coast. The Irish provinces prospered, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> chalking up away wins over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> and the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> respectively, whilst <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster">Leinster</a> held serve at home against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton">Benetton</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht">Connacht</a> saw off French powerhouse Montpellier.</p>
      <p>A number of French teams did put down markers, though, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont">Clermont</a> in particular looking in rich veins of form. Lyon weren’t able to upset <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> Saints at Franklin’s Gardens, however, with the East Midlands side adding a late silver lining for English fans.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="15"><b>Thomas Ramos</b>, Toulouse</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The full-back not only provided Toulouse with an unerring source of points from the boot, he was safe at the back for the French side and was able to launch several probing counter-attacks. After a bright start by Gloucester, Ramos gradually and consistently brought Toulouse back into the game and put them in position to steal all four points.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/mike-haley/">Mike Haley</a>, Munster</p>
      <p>Bronze – Anthony Bouthier, Montpellier</p>

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="14"><b>Teddy Thomas</b>, Racing 92</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thomas was equally clinical in attack as he was reliable in defence on Sunday afternoon. Playing outside of the impossible-to-contain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/virimi-vakatawa/">Virimi Vakatawa</a>, the wing was the adept finisher that Racing needed to see off the challenge of the reigning champions.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/semesa-rokoduguni/">Semesa Rokoduguni</a>, Bath</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/andrew-conway/">Andrew Conway</a>, Munster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="13"><b>Garry Ringrose</b>, Leinster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Ringrose grabbed a hat-trick against Benetton and was pivotal for the province in what was a spirited display from their Italian opponents. He was clinical and efficient in all aspects of his play on Saturday and had to be, to see off the challenges of the two men below, both of whom were similarly impressive.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/sofiane-guitoune/">Sofiane Guitoune</a>, Toulouse</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/henry-slade/">Henry Slade</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="12"><b>Romain Ntamack</b>, Toulouse</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It was another step forward in the burgeoning career of the young French playmaker. He mixed up his game nicely at inside centre, exploiting the space as a carrier when Gloucester’s defence allowed, as well as providing plenty of service to the incisive Guitoune outside of him. Ntamack’s growth mirrors the ever-more impressive Toulouse spine.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/george-moala/">George Moala</a>, Clermont</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/rory-scannell/">Rory Scannell</a>, Munster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="11"><b>Alivereti Raka</b>, Clermont</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Fijian-born wing ran rampant against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> in Clermont’s return to the top table of European rugby. With the ball in his hands and popping up off of his wing, his speed, power and footwork were all too much for Quins to deal with defensively and he was fair value for his two tries.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/la-rochelle/players/arthur-retiere/">Arthur Retiere</a>, La Rochelle</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/keith-earls/">Keith Earls</a>, Munster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="10"><b>Johnny Sexton</b>, Leinster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There was no RWC fatigue on show from the veteran Irishman, as he led Leinster to a solid, albeit unspectacular win over Benetton. He guided the team around the park with trademark efficiency in attack and though the province didn’t quite fire on all cylinders, his influence was significant.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/joe-simmonds/">Joe Simmonds</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/finn-russell/">Finn Russell</a>, Racing 92</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="9"><b>Joe Simpson</b>, Gloucester</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For a large portion of the game, it looked as though <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester">Gloucester</a> would knock off the reigning French champions and the livewire sniping and high tempo play of Simpson was a big part of that. He helped put the Cherry and Whites in a position to win the game, albeit the English side lost control in the second half and began to gift Toulouse possession and penalties.</p>
      <p>Silver – Cobus Reinach, Northampton Saints</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/john-cooney/">John Cooney</a>, Ulster</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Raphael Chaume</b>, Lyon</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Both Chaume and his replacement <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/lyon/players/hamza-kaabeche/">Hamza Kaabeche</a> gave young <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/ehren-painter/">Ehren Painter</a> a torrid time at the scrum at Franklin’s Gardens. Lyon didn’t really click on their trip to the East Midlands, although they were able to bloody Northampton’s nose at the scrum on multiple occasions, frequently led by their dominant looseheads.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/eddy-ben-arous/">Eddy Ben Arous</a>, Racing 92</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster/players/jeremy-loughman/">Jeremy Loughman</a>, Munster</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/RugbyPass/status/1196013022558457857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="2"><b>Julien Marchand</b>, Toulouse</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Consistent at the lineout and a strong source of front-foot ball in attack, Marchand was a persistent thorn in Gloucester’s side. He gave his team a solid set-piece platform and a swiftness of ball in phase play that allowed his backs the time and space they needed to excel in.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/ronan-kelleher/">Ronan Kelleher</a>, Leinster</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster/players/rob-herring/">Rob Herring</a>, Ulster</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="3"><b>Rabah Slimani</b>, Clermont</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The French tighthead really turned the screw on Harlequins at scrum time in the first half, so much so that it prompted early replacements from Paul Gustard’s side. With Clermont in complete control, the prop didn’t have to do too much away from the set-piece, but what he did there in the tight was exceptional.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy/players/marco-riccioni/">Marco Riccioni</a>, Benetton</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/lyon/players/clement-ric/">Clement Ric</a>, Lyon</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="4"><b>Iain Henderson</b>, Ulster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A real vindication of Henderson’s captaincy at the province, as he led his team to a narrow and tight win over Bath at the Rec. Unsurprisingly, he prospered in the physical exchanges and was pivotal to helping Ulster control the gain-line in attack and defence.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/benetton/players/irne-herbst/">Irne Herbst</a>, Benetton</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/paul-jedrasiak/">Paul Jedrasiak</a>, Clermont</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/RugbyPass/status/1196025297222680576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="5"><b>Joe Tekori</b>, Toulouse</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Despite being set to turn 36 next month, Tekori seems to age like a fine wine at Toulouse. His impact has been crucial in the club’s resurgence and his carrying presence was similarly vital at Kingsholm on Friday evening. His experience and physicality continues to be a nice complement to the youthful and elusive threats that Toulouse are building around.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/james-ryan/">James Ryan</a>, Leinster</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton/players/courtney-lawes/">Courtney Lawes</a>, Northampton Saints</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="6"><b>Peceli Yato</b>, Clermont</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Arguably the performance of the weekend across all positions, Yato’s display against Quins was reminiscent of the destruction he wrought on <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> at the RWC, before injury saw him have to leave the field. He was unlucky not to grab a hat-trick on Saturday, although like his teammate Raka, he was superb offensively and tormented Quins throughout the game.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/dave-ewers/">Dave Ewers</a>, Exeter Chiefs</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/connacht/players/paul-boyle/">Paul Boyle</a>, Connacht</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="7"><b>Colby Fainga’a</b>, Connacht</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The flanker was effervescent for Connacht in their win over Montpellier, consistently popping up to stymie French attacks with dominant tackles or slowing their ball at the breakdown. He also contributed strongly as a ball-carrier in a very impressive all-round performance.</p>
      <p>Silver – Josh van der Flier, Leinster</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow/players/callum-gibbins/">Callum Gibbins</a>, Glasgow Warriors</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="8"><b>CJ Stander</b>, Munster</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Munster weren’t at their best in Swansea on Saturday evening, but Stander’s tireless and physical performance was crucial to them eventually securing the bonus point win. On both sides of the ball, the No 8 was forcing himself upon the Ospreys and there was little the Welsh region could do to stop him winning the gain-line as a ball-carrier and a tackler.</p>
      <p>Silver – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont/players/fritz-lee/">Fritz Lee</a>, Clermont</p>
      <p>Bronze – <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/reds/players/caleb-timu/">Caleb Timu</a>, Montpellier</p>
