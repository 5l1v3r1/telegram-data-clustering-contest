      <p>There has been an update on the reported interest from <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> in D.C. United midfielder <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/who-luciano-acosta-profile-dc-3533464">Luciano Acosta</a> .</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-lucharoo-3530596">interview in Argentina</a> , Acosta claimed his former D.C. United team-mate, Derby-bound <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> , had told him to join him at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Rooney joins the Rams as a player-coach in January after spending nearly two years in the United States with the MLS outfit.</p>
      <p>Acosta has also called time on his D.C. United career, and is looking for a new club.</p>
      <p>Fresh reports in <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/?source=googleuksearchads&amp;ad_id=394570647773&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw-3n-rLs5QIVh7PtCh1MvQ-zEAAYASABEgJf_PD_BwE">The Athletic</a> claim that Acosta is “waiting for the call” from Derby over a potential move, but there has been no sign from the Rams that deal could take place.</p>

      <p>The January transfer window is fast approaching - and Derby County have been linked with a surprise move for highly-rated D.C. United attacking midfielder Luciano Acosta.</p>
      <p>The Argentine has spoken about how soon-to-be Derby player-coach <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-lucharoo-3530596">Wayne Rooney has asked him to move to Pride Park</a> , and how he has considered the offer.</p>
      <p>Rooney will officially join the Rams staff at the start of January and could make his debut against Barnsley on January 2.</p>
      <p>Acosta, meanwhile, does have his sights on a return to Boca Juniors, where he began his professional career - but whether he will turn his attention back to Derby should Boca not pick up the phone remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>So what sort of player would the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> be getting should they pull off the unlikely deal?</p>

      <p>Wayne Rooney apparently urged one of his D.C. United team-mates to join him at Derby County.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-championship-results-predict-3525893">Rooney</a> has left the United States after agreeing a deal to sign for the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> as player-coach in January.</p>
      <p>Before departing at the end of the Major League Soccer campaign, the former England star reportedly encouraged Luciano Acosta to follow him to Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Acosta has also called time on his D.C. United career, and is looking for a new club.</p>
      <p>Rooney and Acosta formed a partnership known as LuchoRoo during their time in the US capital.</p>
