      <p>Another week, another failed pass interference call that should’ve been called by refs.</p>
      <p>Facing a 4th down in the first quarter, QB Deshaun Watson let the ball fly to DeAndre Hopkins who was clearly grabbed by Ravens CB Marlon Humphrey, but yet no flag was thrown.</p>
      <p>A challenge flag was thrown and just like every other time, the ruling stood anyway despite the evidence.</p>
