      <p>A shop assistant watched beggars for days and warned shoppers after he and his colleagues noticed some strange movements in a town centre.</p>
      <p>Jake Morris, 26, monitored the street through the windows of Carphone Warehouse in Cheltenham.</p>
      <p>He says he believes there is a gang operating in the town behind the beggars, <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/shop-assistant-watched-beggars-cheltenham-3526891">Gloucestershire Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>"Somebody appeared with a sleeping bag and a sign saying “I am very hungry, God Bless You," Jake said.</p>
      <p>“Then I saw about four other people with exactly the same sign in exactly the same handwriting around town so I became suspicious.</p>
      <p>"I decided to watch through the window of the shop and and keep an eye out.</p>

      <p>“The person I saw couldn’t have been very hungry because people were giving them sandwiches and sausage rolls and they were putting them in a bag rather than eating them.</p>
      <p>"They might have been saving them for later but you would expect somebody who is homeless and starving to eat them straight away.</p>
      <p>“There was another chap coming around to collect money from the begging pot and put it in a bag. They had nice jackets and iPhones and several times people gave them £10 notes.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure they were part of a group. An average person would look at them and think they were genuine, but if you watch them for long enough you see all the holes."</p>
      <p>He said he wants to warn the public because he does not like to see his customers "scammed".</p>
      <p>Jake added officers from Cheltenham Borough Council cleared the town centre one day but the beggars came back the following day.</p>

      <p>"We were really irritated because we had time to see what they were doing," he added.</p>
      <p>"I hate the idea of our customers or anyone coming into town being scammed by people."</p>
      <p>Yvonne Hope, head of public protection at Cheltenham Borough Council, said: “We are aware of this situation and are working with our partners such as the police to monitor and investigate all alleged street begging.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information about these people setting up camps around the town should report it to us via our SOLACE team.</p>
      <p>“We also work closely with <a href="http://www.streetlink.org.uk/">StreetLink</a>  to assist individuals and rough sleepers. If anyone has concerns about a rough sleeper they should contact StreetLink in the first instance with as much information as possible.”</p>
      <p>StreetLink enables members of the public to connect people sleeping rough with the local services that can support them.</p>
