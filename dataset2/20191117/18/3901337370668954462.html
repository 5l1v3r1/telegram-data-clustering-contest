        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/bafana/2021-africa-cup-of-nations-qualifier-report-south-africa-v-sudan-17-november-2019/667614">Wasteful Bafana Sink Group C Leaders In AFCON Qualifier</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>After losing to Ghana on Thursday, Bafana bounced back with a 1-0 win over Group C leader Sudan on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Phiri got the goal for Molefi Nteski's charges and feels it was vital that three points were secured on the day.</p>
      <p>"I think today we came out and proved that we want to win this game, it's an important one, of course we went down in the first game, we needed to rectify our mistakes and I think we played as a collective, that resulted in us winning today," Phiri told SABC.<br/>"For us as players it proved that at the end of the first half we got a goal, so we don't look down on everything that was happening, we kept pushing. We knew that if we keep on working hard we'll get the goal eventually.</p>
      <p>"It's a morale-booster, it's very important for us to bounce back after the Ghana game, going into the next game it's important that we get the win, we could've got more goals but going forward it's a very good booster for us,"Â </p>
