      <h1>'Quality' - Could Derby County have set this guy on the road to greatness?</h1>
      <h2>Frank Lampard is only in his second season of football management but the former Derby boss is being tipped for great things</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:54:09+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Wales</a></address>
      <p>We all know what a great player <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a> was for Chelsea and England, but what about Lampard the best manager in the world?</p>
      <p>The attacking midfielder cut his managerial teeth at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> after finally hanging up his boots, guiding the Rams to the Championship play-off final last May at the end of his first season in the dugout.</p>
      <p>Derby had taken a chance on Lampard after Gary Rowett walked out on them to join Stoke City, and such was his impact at Pride Park that former club Chelsea also <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">backed the managerial novice to succeed</a> when appointing him to replace Maurizio Sarri in the summer.</p>
      <p>Lampard has since guided his team of impressive youngsters to third in the Premier League table, prompting a Blues legend to predict big things for his former Stamford Bridge team-mate.</p>

      <p>Eden Hazard took time out to comment on Lampard’s impact at Chelsea after Belgium's win over Russia on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said: "I know Frank as a player not a manager, but he is a great guy.</p>
      <p>"He has shown already in four months that he can be one of the best managers in the world.</p>
      <p>"The good thing is they are playing with young English players. They are lucky to have young players with quality. Maybe with two or three more they would be first in the Premier League.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea have lost just one of their last 11 fixtures in all competitions, form that has impressed former Liverpool defender Jason McAteer.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/sport/">Racing Post</a>: "What Brendan Rodgers is doing at (second placed) Leicester is outstanding, but the job Frank Lampard is doing at Chelsea is probably even more impressive.</p>
      <p>"I remember speaking to Frank when Chelsea and Liverpool played the Super Cup in Istanbul and you could hear his concerns.</p>
      <p>"Where were the goals going to come from? Could Mason Mount do for Chelsea what he had done for Derby? Would he miss Antonio Rudiger?</p>
      <p>"But he and his players have answered all those questions and more."</p>
