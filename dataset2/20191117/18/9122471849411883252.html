      <h1>Photographer Injured At Georgia-Auburn Releases Statement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:21:29+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>There were a lot of shocking moments in Week 12 of college football. But a Georgia photographer who got run over by Georgia RB Brian Herrien and injured was among the scariest moments.</p>
      <p>Chamberlain Smith, an intern for the Georgia Athletic Department, was accidentally knocked unconscious when Herrien was tackled out of bounds.</p>
      <p>Smith was taken to the hospital and later diagnosed with a concussion and bruises.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Smith has since recovered enough from the injury to make a statement. She took to Twitter and announced that she would be resting and recovering for the next few days. But Smith also pledged to be “back on the sidelines soon!”</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m so glad to be walking away with nothing more than a concussion and some bruises,” she wrote on a Twitter post. “I will be home resting and recovering for the next several days, but look forward to being back on the sidelines soon!”</blockquote>
