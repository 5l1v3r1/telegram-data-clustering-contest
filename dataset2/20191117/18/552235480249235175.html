      <h1>Celtic's Odsonne Edouard valuation 'too high' for Serie A clubs</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops striker has been on fire this season but Celtic will demand a huge fee to sell.</h2>

      <p>Odsonne Edouard is interesting top Italian sides <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> , Napoli and Roma but the trio have been put off by Celtic's high valuation - according to a report that has surfaced in Italy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ilnapolionline.com/2019/11/17/sono-tre-le-italiane-su-eduard-tra-cui-il-napoli/">Napoli Online</a> say that the form of the French striker is such that several "top foreign clubs" are looking to prise him away from Glasgow but the Serie A trio can't afford the huge pricetag.</p>
      <p>Lazio got a close look at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Edouard</a> 's many attributes when he lead the line expertly over two legs in the Europa League, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> winning both matches 2-1.</p>

      <p>With only one fit striker, Celtic would be unlikely to do business in January unless they could secure a mammoth fee for the forward.</p>
      <p>The club's previous transfer record, Â£25m secured for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> from Arsenal, would almost certainly have to be smashed before the Hoops would consider selling.</p>
      <p>Edouard has impressed with his all-round play this season, leading the line with aplomb and scoring 12 goals in all competitions.</p>
      <p>He has also made an impact for the French under-21 side, grabbing 10 goals in five appearances for Sylvain Ripoll's team.</p>
