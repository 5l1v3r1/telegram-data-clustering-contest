      <p>As of now, there is over 300,000 tweets calling for the cut to be released and the topic is trending on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Snyder was the original director of the film but had to step down during reshoots due to a family tragedy. Joss Whedon stepped in and the entire tone of the movie ultimately changed by the time the movie was released.</p>
