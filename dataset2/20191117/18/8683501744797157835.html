      <p>The details surrounding DC’s <i>Black Adam</i> feature film have slowly been coming together. We’ve got <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482658/dwayne-johnson-announces-when-black-adam-will-begin-shooting">The Rock in the starring role</a>, and Jaume Collet-Serra as the director. And we just learned that the <i>Black Adam</i> crew has snagged a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2455276/joker"><i>Joker</i></a> alum for a key production role.</p>
      <p>On November 16, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1195764849059356672">retweeted an interview</a> between Steven Weintraub and Lawrence Sher, <i>Joker</i>’s director of photography. And in the process, he shared some exciting news:</p>
      <blockquote>Larry Sher is a brilliant DP and a great dude! We just worked together on <i>Jungle Cruise</i> and he’ll also shoot <i>Black Adam</i>...</blockquote>
      <p>Though DC hasn’t officially confirmed The Rock’s Twitter announcement, it’s safe to say that it’s probably a done deal. As <i>Joker</i> has quickly become one of the most talked about films of the year (and one of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484942/joker-is-officially-crossing-the-1-billion-mark">the most successful movies <i>ever</i></a>), Lawrence Sher has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483154/joker-cinematographer-reveals-fate-of-zazie-beetz-sohie">offered some insights</a> into the collaborative environment on the set. And that, in turn, has given fans some idea of how he works. <i>Black Adam</i> won’t just mark his second time working with The Rock -- he will also be re-teaming with <i>Jungle Cruise</i>’s director, Jaume Collet-Serra, who thus far is best known for horror fare like <i>Orphan</i> and <i>The Shallows</i>.</p>
      <p>The news marks an ongoing shift in Lawrence Sher’s career. Prior to taking on <i>Joker</i>, the director of photography built a career working on well-known comedies -- like <i>The Hangover</i> series, with his frequent collaborator, Todd Phillips. He also worked with Zach Braff, on films like <i>Garden State</i> and <i>Wish I Was Here</i>. But he’s begun to branch out over the past couple of years with bigger budget fare like <i>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</i>.</p>
      <p>Lawrence Sher has plenty of time to get ready for production on <i>Black Adam</i>. The film’s producer, Hiram Garcia, recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478008/black-adam-producer-confirms-planned-filming-date">it won’t begin shooting</a> until the end of 2020. However, he won’t have waited nearly as long as The Rock, who’s been on board <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482658/dwayne-johnson-announces-when-black-adam-will-begin-shooting">to play the titular hero</a> for over a decade. In the meantime, he has another project besides <i>Jungle Cruise</i> in post-production -- another comedy-drama, <i>The Starling.</i></p>
      <p>Though the tone of <i>Black Adam</i> will likely be quite a bit different than <i>Joker,</i> Lawrence Sher has already proven that he’s capable of successfully bringing a comic book icon to the screen. We’re excited to see how he adapts his visual style to yet another unique universe.</p>
      <p>There’s no official release date yet, but <i>Black Adam</i> will probably be hitting theaters in late 2021. Don't forget: Zachary Levi said he thinks Shazam and Black Adam <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476558/zachary-levi-thinks-hell-face-off-against-the-rocks-black-adam-in-shazam-3">will face-off in <i>Shazam! 3</i></a>, which would obviously come out after <i>Shazam! 2</i>, which we're still waiting to see<i>.</i> Until then, we’ll be watching for more updates from the production team.
