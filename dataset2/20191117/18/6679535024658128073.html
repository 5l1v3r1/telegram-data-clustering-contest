      <h2>Protesters demand return of money they lost by investing in the firm</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:54:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:54</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>High drama ensued outside the office of I Monetary Advisory (IMA) Group, the firm facing charges of cheating thousands of investors and being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), at Shivajinagar on Sunday evening, as over 50 investors who have lost their money staged a protest.</p>
      <p>The impromptu protest came on the eve of the deadline for filing nominations for the bypoll in Shivajinagar Assembly segment, a seat vacated by R. Roshan Baig who is allegedly involved in the IMA scam. The BJP has blocked his entry into the party for the same reason. He is now said to be contesting as an Independent.</p>
      <p>There was tension at the spot for some time as the police tried to disperse the protesters. A senior police official claimed that one of the protesters threw a stone at the police. Though no one was injured, the police then resorted to caning.</p>
      <p>Fathima, one of the protesters, alleged they were protesting seeking justice and that they were hurt by the police action.</p>
      <p>“We requested the investors to disperse as they had not taken permission for the protest, and moreover the model code of conduct for the bypoll is in force. But they did not listen. The situation was brought under control soon. The protest was organised over WhatsApp and we were caught by surprise,” said a senior police official from the East division.</p>
      <p>The investors had one demand — they wanted back the money they had lost by investing in IMA. However, the CBI probe is going on and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has till date seized assets worth over ₹300 crore from IMA and its directors. “It will be through the ED that we, the investors, will get back some money. A chargesheet hasn’t even been filed in the case. The pain of the victims who have lost money is now being misused for political gains,” said Ateeq Ahmed, one of the investors, from Fraser Town.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Rafiq, a social worker from Shivajinagar, said the IMA scandal would dominate the bypoll campaign and alleged that the Sunday’s protest was “politically motivated”.</p>
