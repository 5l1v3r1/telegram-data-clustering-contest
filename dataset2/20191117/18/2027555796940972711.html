      <p>Sudha Murthy launched a children’s book, ‘The Daughter from a Wishing Tree: Unusual Tales about Women in Mythology’, on November 14, marking the occasion of Children’s Day, at an event held at Crosswords, Malleshwaram.</p>
      <p>This is the fourth installment to her mythology series, preceded by ‘The Serpent’s Revenge: Unusual Tales from the Mahabharata’, ‘The Man from the Egg: Unusual Tales about the Trinity’, and ‘The Upside-Down King: Unusual Tales about Rama and Krishna’.</p>
      <p>The book contains 24 stories that focuses on the women in mythology.</p>
      <p>Metrolife spoke to the author and entreprenuer, about her latest work.</p>
      <p>What inspired you to write this book?</p>
      <p>I felt that women are not represented properly. The sacrifices women make often go unnoticed. Mythology places the spotlight on men. Very few women, such as Sita and Draupadi, get attention. I thought that it was time to tell the stories of other women. These women have played a vital role in deciding the future of their families and lineage, and I wanted them to be recognised.</p>
      <p>Why did you write this book for children?</p>
      <p>This book is part of a series that I began writing because I thought it would be a great way for parents to initiate their children to the epics. The fifth and the last book will come out next year.</p>
      <p>Do you prefer writing for adults or children?</p>
      <p>I don’t know. I write whenever a story starts to brew in my mind. I don’t really think about who I am writing it for. I want to be able to share my knowledge, and that’s what I try to do with my books.</p>
      <p>You are an avid reader. Who is your favourite author?</p>
      <p>It keeps changing depending on the stage of life I am at.</p>
      <p>You left Telco in 1982 to help your husband start Infosys. You have since gone on to do different things, but do you miss engineering?</p>
      <p>Not really. I am very invested in and very happy with the work I am doing now.</p>
      <p>Does it bother you that despite all your work, many still refer to you as Narayana Murthy’s wife?</p>
      <p>Along with every successful woman, there has to be an understanding husband. He has been that for me. I am not bothered by what others have to say. Is it not true that I am Narayana Murthy’s wife? My work is important, and I focus on that. I know what I am, the rest is unimportant.</p>
