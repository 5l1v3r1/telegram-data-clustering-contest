      </p>
      <p>The vast majority of immigration applicants would need a job offer under the policy and would need to wait five years to be eligible to claim benefits.</p>
      <p>Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott labelled the plans as a “Tory race to the bottom” and that “Trump would be proud” of the proposals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC there would be a “great deal” of EU immigration if he becomes Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>However, he stopped short of saying freedom of movement with the EU would continue.</p>
      <p>“A lot of EU nationals have made their homes in this country and made a massive contribution to our society,” he said. “So they absolutely must have the right to remain and bring their families here.”</p>
      <p>Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said Corbyn “refuses to be straight with people on immigration” and that a Labour government would lead to a surge in new arrivals.</p>

      <p>Raab also revealed further details of the Tories’ immigration plans, which include banning serious criminals from moving to the UK, increasing the health surcharge for international workers and spending £20m on border protection.</p>
      <p>“We want to be able to plug gaps in specific sectors, whether it is the NHS or elsewhere but what you don’t want to do is encourage a reliance on cheap labour from abroad which has a depressing effect on wages,” he said.</p>
