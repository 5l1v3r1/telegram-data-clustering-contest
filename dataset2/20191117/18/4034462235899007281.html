      <h1>These Luxury Cars Are Receiving Massive Discounts This Week</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to Black Friday shopping.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:20:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>It's that time of the year when the American economy goes into overtime. The holiday season is officially underway and people are preparing to go shopping, seeking the hottest deals in town, or online. Automakers, understandably so, want to get in on the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/strap-in-black-friday-deals-are-already-starting">buying action</a>. Even luxury brands, such as BMW, Jaguar, and Acura, are taking advantage of the holiday shopping spirit. <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/black-friday-luxury-car-deals">Cars Direct</a> has done some digging and, lo and behold, there are luxury car incentives out there for the taking. You just have to know where to look and, fortunately, you're in the right place.</p>
      <p>Starting with BMW, the German automaker is offering discounts and cheaper leases not just on 2019 models but all-new 2020s as well. Nearly every new 2020 crossover, such as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/x1">X1</a>, has $2,000 to $2,500 in savings plus 3.25 percent financing. There's a $1,000 signing bonus on most models when coming from a competing brand. Mercedes-Benz, meanwhile, is authorizing dealers to slash anywhere from $7,500 to $15,000 in dealer cash to discount even the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/s-class">S-Class</a>. You can even get the popular <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/glc">2020 GLC</a> with 1.99 percent APR for 72 months plus a waiver on your first monthly payment up to $600.</p>

      <p>For its part, Jaguar is slashing as much as $14,550 off the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jaguar/xf">2019 XF sedan</a>. Even the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jaguar/f-type">F-Type V6</a> can now be leased for $499 a month, a $30 per month price reduction.</p>
      <p>Moving over to Japan, Acura has a lease incentive of up to $9,200 for the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/acura/tlx">2020 TLX</a>. Be sure to inquire about the so far unadvertised $5,000 in dealer cash on models such as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/acura/mdx">2020 MDX</a>.</p>
      <p>Want a new Lexus? How about 0 percent APR for 60 months on every 2019 Lexus? Yep, it's happening. There are also attractive discounts on the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lexus/nx">2020 NX</a> with as much as $2,000 off or a 0.9 percent APR.</p>

      <p>Hopping back to America, Buick refuses to not take advantage of the festivities by offering over $11,000 in savings on nicely equipped <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/buick/enclave">2019 Enclaves</a>. Fancy something smaller? There's 0 percent APR for 72 months on <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/buick/encore">2019 Encores</a> or as much as 22 percent off MSRP, which translates to about $7,000 off the Premier trim. If you've been holding out on buying a new luxury vehicle, chances are your patience is about to pay off, but you need to make sure to ask about any unadvertised offers as well.</p>
