      <p>BETHLEHEM, Palestinian Territory — Relatives say a Palestinian freelance photographer has lost vision in one eye after apparently being struck by Israeli fire while covering a demonstration in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>Palestinian colleagues say Muath Amarneh, 35, was targeted by Israeli forces during a demonstration last week near the volatile West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
      <p>Palestinian journalists held a protest Sunday in Bethlehem. In several Arab countries, journalists also posted photos on social media wearing eye patches in solidarity.</p>
      <p>Israel’s paramilitary border police says it didn’t target Amarneh and only used “nonlethal” crowd-dispersal weapons at the protest where he was hit. It released a video of what it says was Amarneh standing behind a group of stone throwers.</p>
      <p>Amarneh was transferred to Israel’s Hadassah Medical Center, which described his eye injury as “serious.”</p>
