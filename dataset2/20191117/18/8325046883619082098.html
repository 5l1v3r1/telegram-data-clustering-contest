Considering that the average US driver pays $935 for coverage, auto insurance in Tennessee is fairly affordable.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for car insurance in this state, it’s worth understanding a bit about how car insurance works. Insurance companies look at lots of different <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/car-insurance-rates-men-vs-women-2019-4">factors</a>, including your age, gender, where you live in the state, and even your credit score to determine your rates. Each insurance company looks at these factors differently. That means they’ll price your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-insurance-premium-definition-cost">premium</a>, or the amount you’ll pay for coverage, differently too.</p>
      <p>It’s important to shop around and make sure that you’re getting the best coverage for your money. Here are a few ideas on where to start shopping.</p>
      <h3>Who has the best cheap car insurance in Tennessee?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/car-insurance/credit-scores-affect-auto-insurance-rates/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a> compiled data from each car insurance in every state on pricing formulas.

Here are the best car insurance companies at each credit level in Tennessee, along with their average premium for a single adult driver.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-good-credit-score">good credit</a> (670 to 739, according to FICO), drivers can get some affordable rates from these three companies, on average.</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Tennessee Farmers car insurance: $906 per year</li>
        <li>State Farm car insurance: $1,260 per year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drivers with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-excellent-credit-score">excellent credit scores,</a> (or FICO scores of 800 and above) will get some of the best rates in Tennessee, on average.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $754 per year</li>
        <li>Tennessee Farmers car insurance: $860 per year</li>
        <li>State Farm car insurance: $1,029 per year</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Tennessee Farmers car insurance: $1,064 per year</li>
        <li>USAA car insurance: $1,874 per year</li>

      <p>It might be worth doing a little bit of work to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-increase-your-credit-score-improve-credit">raise your credit score</a> before shopping around – it could make a big difference in the amount you’ll pay for coverage.</p>
      <p>Shopping around is essential to getting the best rate for you. Car insurance rates can vary widely, so it’s worth doing some research to get the best price. To do this, get several quotes from different insurance companies and compare them.
