      <p>Commuters in the city continue to suffer under scorching sun, and rain as most of the bus stops do not have shelters, forcing them to stand in the open.</p>
      <p>Thousands of commuters travel on city and mofussil buses every day whereas the basic amenity of shelter with seating facility is absent in many bus stops.</p>
      <p>Stops on Perundurai Road, Brough Road, Karur Road and Poondurai Road do not have shelter.</p>
      <p>Commuters board buses in large numbers at Panneerselvam Park, Kalaimadu Statue, Railway Station, Surampatti Four Road Junction and Manikoondu where the available shelters are inadequate.</p>
      <p>S. Uma, who travels frequently from GH Roundabout on Perundurai Road, said that around 50 to 80 commuters boarded buses at the stop at a time during morning hours and they were forced to stand on the road risking their life.</p>
      <p>The bus stop outside the government hospital was moved 50 m away after the flyover was constructed. “But, patients and visitors have to stand on the road under the sun or get drenched during rains,” said Mahendran from Vellode.</p>
      <p>Many shelters were removed during road widening works, but were not restored or no alternative space was allotted. “The commuters need shelters as we cannot stand under the shades of trees or in front of shops,” he added.</p>
      <p>Many commuters said that visitors to the city would feel let down as there was no bus shelter or information about the bus routes.</p>
      <p>It was a growing city and priority should be to establish basic amenities for the commuters, said S. Pradeepan, a college student. The Corporation officials said that discussions were on for establishing bus shelters.</p>
