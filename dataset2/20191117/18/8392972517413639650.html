      <h1>5 hilarious I'm A Celebrity Bushtucker trials we love watching again and again</h1>
      <h2>Which ridiculous challenge do you find the most memorable?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:48:13+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Dimery</a></address>
      <p>The 2019 series of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> starts tonight... and if you're anything like us, you'll be champing at the bit for the action to start.</p>
      <p>Speaking of 'champing at the bit', we've seen some pretty bonkers Bushtucker trials over the years, with our celebrity heroes chowing down on everything from turkey's testicles to pig's brains.</p>
      <p>They've also shared tanks, baths and tunnels with some of the scariest creatures on the planet.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the start of the new run, look back at some of the funniest - and most horrifying - trials in I'm A Celebrity history...</p>

        <b>1. John Barrowman eats a bull's penis (2018)</b>
      </p>
      <p>John, now 52, looked horrified as he was presented with a plate containing a long, grey, spindly appendage, whimpering: "I knew you were going to give me a penis!"</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite his protestations, the TV and stage star managed to polish off some of the snack – and later admitted that he'd eaten worse during his time in the jungle.</p>
      <p>"Taste-wise, the fermented egg," he explained. "The hardest to eat was the spider because it exploded."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Speaking of spiders, Emmerdale star Adam Thomas took bravery to a whole new level when he inserted a gigantic arachnid into his mouth – despite being terrified of the things.</p>
      <p>We were on the edge of our seats as the courageous actor, now 31, sat there pale-faced, the beast's hairy legs protruding from his lips.</p>
      <p>The things these celebs will put themselves through!</p>

        <b>3. Joe Swash eats a crocodile's penis and testicles (2008)</b>
      </p>
      <p>John Barrowman isn't the only one who's had to munch on an animal's sexual organs – Joe Swash, now 37, was tasked with digesting a crocodile's member on his way to winning the 2008 series.</p>
      <p>As the former EastEnders actor gagged and wretched over the chewy meal, Ant and Dec egged him on, with Ant laughing: "Keep it in, because you don't want any dropping out."</p>

        <b>4. Emily Atack and Malique Thompson-Dwyer sing while covered in ants (2018)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Inbetweeners actress Emily, now 29, and Hollyoaks star Malique, now 21, were thrust into an imaginative trial last year, where they had to sing famous chart songs with their mouths clamped open.</p>
      <p>What made the task funny for us viewers at home was that the two celebs were confined to X-shaped tanks, and had green ants crawling all over them, meaning that their renditions were permeated by random screams.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, their campmates managed to guess what they were singing!</p>

        <b>5. Vicky Pattison, Ferne McCann and Spencer Matthews are swarmed by creepy crawlies (2015)</b>
      </p>
      <p>We really felt for Geordie Shore actress Vicky, 32, TOWIE star Ferne, 29, and Made In Chelsea's Spencer, 31, as they were made to get up close and personal with hundreds of little critters as they stood with their heads and arms in plastic tanks.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, though, Ant and Dec found the episode funny.</p>
      <p>The Geordie presenters smirked and stifled their giggles as the three celebrities were used as human walkways by the slimy creatures. Charming!</p>
