      <h1>Corporation to privatise operations at MCCs</h1>
      <h2>The civic body plans to hand over them to SHGs, waste management firms or contractors after tender process</h2>

      <p>Coimbatore Corporation may soon privatise operations at the micro compost centres (MCCs) it is constructing to locally process wet, organic waste.</p>
      <p>The Corporation is constructing MCCs at 69 places in the city at ₹ 43.98 crore under the Smart Cities Mission and of the 69, it has thus far completed around 25 MCCs. Its objective in constructing the MCCs is to take to the waste generated in a locality to the nearest MCC to prevent its transportation all the way to its dump yard in Vellalore.</p>
      <p>To aid the collection of wet, organic waste, the Corporation has placed orders for 102 small goods carrier vehicles and is in the process of placing order for another 57. Of the 102 vehicles, the Corporation has received and deployed on field around 70 vehicles.</p>
      <p>Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath said that the civic body was looking at privatising the operations at the MCCs by handing them over to self-help groups, waste management companies or contractors by selecting them after a tender process.</p>
      <p>The Corporation would not only handover the MCCs but also the small goods carriers to the successful bidders so that they operate both the MCC and the vehicles attached to those in their area of operations.</p>
      <p>This, Mr. Jatavath said, would help the Corporation fix responsibility on those operating the MCCs for poor collection of waste in areas given to them and processing at MCCs.</p>
      <p>The Corporation officials familiar with the developments said the civic body was working on a few models of privatisation – whether to pay the MCC operators based on the weight of waste collected or number of houses from where they collected the waste.</p>
      <p>It was also thinking of geo-tagging the vehicles to be given to the MCC operators to prevent misuse of vehicles or use outside their designated area.</p>
      <p>The Corporation wanted to privatise the operations at MCCs and track the vehicles because it wanted prevent misuse of the facility and diversion of its resources by field officials to help commercial establishments, the officials said and pointed out a recent incident where Mr. Jatavath found non-medical waste from a hospital getting dumped at the Peelamedu transit station, in violation of rules.</p>
      <p>With MCCs and vehicles out of the control of the field officials, the Corporation could end misuse and hold responsible the private operators in case of misdeeds. The field officials job would remain confined to just supervising the waste management in wards.</p>
