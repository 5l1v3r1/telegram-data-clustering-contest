        <i>A Tory PM is suppressing evidence by the intelligence agencies about the activities of hostile forces, says <b>Richard Norton-Taylor</b>, and <b>Adrian Cosker </b>says there will be a permanent question mark over the validity of recent elections</i>

      <p>Chris Bryant rightly reminds us of Russian cyber-attacks on targets here and how Conservative governments have allowed Russian “dirty money” to enter the country as he called on Boris Johnson to come clean and publish the cross-party intelligence and security committee’s report on Kremlin meddling in Britain (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/tories-have-ignored-russian-meddling-for-years-says-chris-bryant">Tories ‘have deliberate amnesia’ over Russia’s UK meddling</a>, 14 November).</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> had blocked a parliamentary report on attempts by Putin’s Russia to interfere in British politics, we could be sure that opposition MPs, egged on by large sections of the media, would seize on it as evidence that we cannot trust the Labour leader to protect Britain’s national security. A Conservative prime minister is now suppressing evidence given to the committee by the intelligence agencies about the activities of hostile forces. Perhaps we should ask whether a Johnson government can be trusted with protecting our security.<br/><b>Richard Norton-Taylor</b><br/><i>London</i></p>
      <p>• Can I urge the Guardian to support Marina Litvinenko’s legal action for the urgent and full publication of the report on Russian interference in our elections (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/russian-meddling-report-dissidents-widow-goes-to-law">Litvinenko’s widow to sue over release of Russia report</a>, 16 November)? We also need to know now if there are any lawful means by which Mr Johnson could possibly suppress publication of the report if he gains a majority in parliament. If so, it is all the more vital that the report is released before the election, otherwise there will be a permanent question mark over the validity not only of 2016 and 2107 votes, but also over this election. And the nation will become perhaps even more bitterly divided than at present, with the legitimacy of the referendum – and of any mandate Mr Johnson might get – put in doubt.<br/><b>Adrian Cosker</b><br/><i>Hitchin, </i><i>Hertfordshire</i></p>
