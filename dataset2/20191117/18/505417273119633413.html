      <h1>Match-Winner Gives Memorable Interview As Kilcoo Progress In Ulster</h1>

        <b><a href="https://twitter.com/KilcooGAC">Kilcoo</a> will go in search of their first-ever Ulster club football title after squeezing past Fermanagh’s Derrygonnelly by 1-8 to 0-9.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Down champions were pushed all the way by the five-in-a-row Fermanagh champions but in the end, it was Aaron Branagan’s goal that separated the two sides.</p>
      <p>The centre-back finished with a haul of 1-1 in a man of the match performance and gave a memorable interview to RTÉ afterwards.</p>
      <blockquote>“Me scoring goals, that’s a small miracle,” Branagan joked.</blockquote>

      <p>“We tend to leave it late to push on in games. We know how to get over the line and we know how to dog out games. It was well refereed.</p>
      <p>“That’s the way we like it, nice and tough.”</p>
      <p>Champions of Down for the sixth time in seven years and back in an <a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/kennedymarisa760/st-mullins-march-on-while-commercials-edge-out-miltown-in-munster/">Ulster final</a>, Gaelic football is clearly number one in the small village outside Newry.</p>
      <p>According to Branagan, there isn’t much else to the place other than Gaelic football.</p>

      <blockquote>“I was actually talking to a boy this morning. He said, ‘There’s nothing else to do in Kilcoo but play football, go to mass and have a few sheep’. That’s really it.”</blockquote>
      <p>One of five brothers on the team, he continued to joke saying they talk more about sheep than they do about football before heaping some well deserved praise onto legendary manager Mickey Moran who is still producing the goods.</p>
      <blockquote>“To best honest, they talk more about sheep,” Branagan said.</blockquote>

      <p>“Football gets a wee bit of talk as well. It’s nice to play with your brothers.</p>
      <p>“Mickey is something else. I always say he’s like the grandad I never had. He’s the best. Everything he says, everybody is totally attentive.</p>
      <p>“He knows what to do, how to get us over the line. He calms us down. There’s no shouting.”</p>
      <p>Can’t beat the club championships.</p>
