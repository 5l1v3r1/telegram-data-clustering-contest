        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> have moved to get ahead of the competition in the race for Brazilian teenager Reinier Jesus, who is wanted by a host of Europe’s top clubs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old is fast becoming one of the most sought-after talents in the word games due to his performances for Brazil at youth level and for his club side Flamengo.</p>
      <p>The midfielder only made his Flamengo debut at the end of July, but already has four goals in 11 Serie A games as he appears to be living up to the hype surrounding him.</p>
      <p>The likes of Liverpool, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> and Atletico Madrid are all thought to be interested in the teenager, while Everton were also thought to be keen over the summer.</p>
      <p>However, Arsenal appear to have made a move to bring him to the Emirates as representative have spoken to the youngster’s father over a possible transfer.</p>

      <p>Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo reports that the Gunners have made their interest clear to Reinier’s dad and hope to persuade him that north London is the best destination for his son.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian has not spoken of his link with Arsenal, but he has previously expressed his delight that Atletico Madrid have shown an interest in him.</p>
      <p>‘It’s an honour that Atletico are interested in me because they are a huge club,’ said the young midfielder.</p>
      <p>‘It’s another honour to know that one of the biggest clubs in the world is watching me.</p>
      <p>‘But I’m a Flamengo player and my objective is to keep doing a good job here to win many titles in Brazil.’</p>
      <p>Reinier is under contract at Flamengo until 2020 and has a release clause of around £60m in his deal, a fee which his club would expect to be met by any potential suitor.</p>
