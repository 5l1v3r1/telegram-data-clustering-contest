      <p>FORT MYERS BEACH, Fla. — Today we saw some of the coolest temperatures since last spring.</p>
      <p>There have been concerns that the cold weather and higher red tide levels could be bad for businesses.</p>
      <p>Fox 4 spoke to tourists and local business owners who say that this may not have been the case out on Fort Myers beach.</p>
      <p>Head chef at Mojoes Coffee Cafe says he excited about the season and hasn’t seen a decline in tourism over the last couple weeks.</p>
      <p>“It seems to not be affecting anybody tourism wise. Colder temps aren’t keeping people away. Of course, its a lot colder up north, so this is nothing,” said Keith Schambelan.</p>
      <p>We spoke to a group of visitors who came into town on a girl’s trip, expecting to escape the cold in sunny Southwest Florida, but with today’s low of fifty-five degrees, their plans have changed.</p>
      <p>Mary Pritchard says today they will, “wonder and go to the stores, and have a drink outside... go to the restaurants and shops.”</p>
      <p>The manager of Yucatan Beachstand Bar &amp; Grill says that surprisingly, the red tide levels and low temps have prompted people to come into the restaurant.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing else to do, so come out and eat and drink. Everybody comes in carries on and has a good time,” says Jill Eby.</p>
      <p>Local businesses say even changed their menus and offered specials to ensure people are still supporting the beach economy.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had soup and sandwich specials like grill cheese and Maryland crab soup,” said Dyana Imhof</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, that will make up for some of the things that we can control around here like red tide and the cooler temperatures,” said Eby.</p>
      <p>Fox 4 saw tons of people bundled up in their jackets on the beach today, but the weather and high red tide levels didn’t seem to stop any of the fun.</p>
      <p>We will continue to follow how weather changes might affect the snowbird season and the economy in the long run.</p>
