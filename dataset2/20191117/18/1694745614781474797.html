      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kristen-Bell">Kristen Bell</a> and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Jimmy-Fallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> are about to take you to a whole new world. The <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Frozen-2"><b>Frozen 2</b></a> actress stopped by <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Tonight-Show-Starring-Jimmy-Fallon"><b>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</b></a> on Tuesday to drop some info about <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Frozen-2-Trailer-45792983">her upcoming film</a> <i>and</i> to belt out a History of Disney Songs medley. Bell, who voices Princess Anna and has a Broadway background, sounded right at home singing a selection of magical tunes that are full of nostalgia.</p>
      <p>Fallon kicked things off with "When You Wish Upon a Star" before he and Bell jumped into "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious," and everything was a dream from then on out. They covered classics like "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" and "Part of Your World," along with newer hits like "Remember Me" from <b>Coco</b> and "Into the Unknown" from the <b>Frozen 2</b> soundtrack. Of course, Bell couldn't escape a friendly "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?" serenade from Fallon, and she appropriately closed things out with a gorgeous few seconds of "Let It Go." Whew, that is not easy work, but these two pros make it look effortless. Watch the full video above to see the magic ensue.</p>
