      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:55:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>A man has been arrested after ­Wycombe Wanderers goalkeeper Ryan Allsop alleged homophobic abuse was aimed at him during ­yesterday’s League One game at Tranmere Rovers.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside club confirmed an incident did occur during the match at Prenton Park – which ­Wycombe won 2-0 to move to the top of the division – and was being dealt with by police.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Allsop, 27, reported the abuse to the referee during the interval after he had kept goal at the Kop end in the first half.</p>
      <p>A statement from the home club read: “Tranmere Rovers Football Club are very disappointed to learn of a homophobic comment made during today’s match against ­Wycombe Wanderers.</p>
      <p>“The club takes matters like this very seriously with a zero-tolerance policy.</p>
      <p>“As a consequence of today’s ­actions, one supporter has been ­arrested and the matter is being dealt with by the police.”</p>
      <p>The Football Association is also understood to be aware of the ­incident and will await the referee’s report and seek further ­information from all parties involved before ­deciding how to proceed.</p>
      <p>On the pitch, a Adebayo Akinfenwa header and a Joe Jacobson penalty secured the win for Gareth Ainsworth’s side.</p>
