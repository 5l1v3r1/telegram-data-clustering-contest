        <b>Daniele Bonera described how there is “never much time” at AC Milan, where Marco Giampaolo was given just seven games as coach</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marco Giampaolo needed more time to have a genuine chance of implementing his plans for AC Milan, according to assistant coach Daniele Bonera.</p>
      <p>Milan sacked Giampaolo following a 2-1 win over Genoa in October, his seventh match in charge.</p>
      <p>The former Sampdoria boss presided over three victories and four defeats before the Rossoneri rushed to appoint Stefano Pioli – a move that, so far, has failed to lead to an upturn in the team’s fortunes.</p>
      <p>Pioli has led the team to four points from five games since his arrival, with their solitary triumph coming at home to lowly SPAL.</p>

      <p>“In a few months, two coaches arrived with different working methods, two ways of thinking on a defensive level,” Bonera, an assistant under both coaches, told La Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
      <p>“With Giampaolo, we thought more about the ball. With Pioli, we are more practical and we work on the positioning of players.</p>
      <p>“Giampaolo did not have the time he needed, but at a club like Milan there is never much time.”</p>
      <p>Asked about the players, Bonera said: “I see guys who are very committed. Many are really young, in their twenties. It takes time.</p>
      <p>“We need patience, which is a rare commodity in football. We are trying to do better every day. I’ve never seen any of the players holding back because of fatigue.”</p>
      <p>Milan’s problems could grow further if Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain launch a January bid to sign goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, as has been rumoured in recent days.</p>
      <p>Bonera, who made over 150 Serie A appearances for Milan during his nine-year spell with the club as a player, recommends the 20-year-old Donnarumma remains with his boyhood club.</p>
      <p>“As a fan and someone in love with Milan, I would recommend he stay with us,” Bonera said.</p>
      <p>“But he has staff and family who advise him.”</p>
