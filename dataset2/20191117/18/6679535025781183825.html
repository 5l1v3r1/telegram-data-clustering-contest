      <p>After a long gap, construction works for Mulluvadi gate flyover resumed recently. Officials are planning to complete the works by mid 2020.</p>
      <p>The Mulluvadi railway level crossing is one of the major points for traffic congestion in Salem as the gates are closed multiple times a day. Following continuous demand, a flyover was proposed in the area and works began in 2016. The railway portion of the bridge has been completed.</p>
      <p>The Projects Wing of Highways Department started the construction works in September 2018. The pace of the project was affected due to delay in transferring cables of utility services like telephone and electricity, a senior official of the department said. Once completed, the flyover would ease traffic movement between Hasthampatti and old bus stand, the official added.</p>
      <p>According to officials, the flyover would facilitate two-way traffic between Ambedkar statue and old bus stand area near Sukavaneswar Temple.</p>
      <p>The project is being implemented at â‚¹83 crore. The total length of the flyover is 510.4 m and the pathway about 11 m wide.</p>
