      <p><b>Ranchi: </b>Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday exuded confidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will win more than 62 out of 81 Assembly seats in Jharkhand.</p>
      <p>"We will win more than 62 seats this time," Javadekar told reporters here after inaugurating the BJP's media centre for elections.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said that the party is confident of retaining power in the state.</p>
      <p>The Union Minister said that the fight is not between the BJP and any other party but it will be for a government dedicated to the development of the state.</p>
      <p>"The fight is between a government dedicated to the people's development and the people who want to develop themselves," said he.</p>
      <p>Javadekar said the fight in elections will be to elect a government, which could work for the people's welfare.</p>
      <p>"The fight is between a government dedicated to working for the state's progress and the people who want to loot the state," he said.</p>
      <p>The BJP leader said that Chief Minister Raghuvar Das brought in positive changes in the lives of the people during his rule in the last five years.</p>
      <p>"The state has seen a government with a clean image and dedicated to the development," said he.</p>
      <p>Jharkhand will go to five-phased elections starting November 30. The counting of votes will be done on December 23.</p>
      <p>In 2014, the BJP won 35 seats and formed the government with the support of All Jharkhand Students' Union (AJSU), which has now snapped its ties with the party.</p>
      <p>Jharkhand Mukri Morcha (JMM) finished second in the tally with 17 seats while Congress was decimated to just six Assembly seats.</p>
