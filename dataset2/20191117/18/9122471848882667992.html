      <h1>Former LSU QB Rohan Davey Posts Message For Joe Burrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:47:18+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Former LSU quarterback Rohan Davey showed nothing but love to current Tiger signal caller Joe Burrow after Burrow broke Davey’s single-season passing yardage record.</p>
      <p>Davey threw for 3,347 yards in 2001, a mark which Burrow topped in the first half of last night’s win over Ole Miss. Burrow has thrown for 3,687 yards in only 10 games so far this season.</p>
      <p>Davey congratulated Burrow with a lengthy Facebook post earlier today, which you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2624141057632064&amp;set=a.914782858567901&amp;type=3&amp;theater">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Below is the message Davey wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Huge congratulations to my guy Joe on breaking the single season passing record. I’ve had the honor and privilege of holding this record for 18yrs.<br/><br/>Few things makes me prouder than being the quarterback and leader of the 2001 record setting team! That season and team many believe laid the foundation for the Rebirth of this great program and the greatness we are witnessing today! Congrats to Coach O,the staff and entire team! Joe it has been a pleasure watching you lead and play the quarterback position! Nothing but love and continued success my dude!! See you in New Orleans!!! Geauxxxxxxx Tigers!!</blockquote>
      <p>Burrow will have plenty of opportunities to add to his record-setting season. LSU has regular season games left against Arkansas and Texas A&amp;M, plus the SEC Championship Game.</p>
      <p>After that, the Tigers will play in the College Football Playoff, assuming they get through the next three games unscathed.</p>
