      <h1>Odell Beckham Jr. Rips NFL For Drug Testing Him Way Too Much</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:33:59+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>There are some players who believe that the NFL’s random drug testing isn’t so random, given the sheer numbers of players around the league.</p>
      <p>Browns receiver Odell Beckham is one of those players who doesn’t think that it is random.</p>
      <p>Beckham complained about that fact to the Cleveland media after Thursday Night Football when he griped about the NFL singling him out for random drug tests.</p>
      <blockquote>“(The NFL) made me come in Monday when we had an off day. Had a drug test,” Beckham said, via <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/odell-beckham-jr-tells-clevelandcom-hes-upset-over-volume-of-random-drug-tests-nobody-is-getting-tested-like-me.html">Hayden Grove of cleveland.com</a>. “Made me come in Thursday after the game. Had another drug test. Every week, twice a week.<br/><br/>“Nobody is getting tested like me. I know people who didn’t get tested for five months in the offseason and I’m getting tested every time.”</blockquote>
      <p>Aside from drug tests, Beckham has also complained he is being targeted by the league when it comes to flags and on-field confrontations, as well as his fashion that he displays.</p>
      <p>The all-pro WR just doesn’t want to feel like the league him under a microscope.</p>
