      <p>"Everyday I thank God for you. Thank you for all that you have done, for all that you continue to do and for what's to come. You are magical, Ru and I couldn't possibly love you more. X"</p>
      <p>RuPaul and Michelle have pioneered the LGBTQIA+ community over the past 20 years and brought drag to the mainstream thanks to RuPaul’s Drag Race which began in the US and started in the UK this year.</p>
      <p>Both Michelle and RuPaul are on the judging panel of the hit show.</p>

      <p>It comes after <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> fans are worried for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/michelle-visage">Michelle</a> as she has landed a place at the bottom of the leaderboard on Saturday's edition of the dancing show.</p>
      <p>She performed to the popular 1990 Madonna hit Vogue with professional partner Giovanni Pernice, but her time left in the competition could now be at risk due to receiving the lowest score.</p>

      <p>The dancing duo scored 32 points for their couples' choice routine but it put them below all the other couples in tonight's show.</p>
      <p>One fan took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to share: "See if Emma makes it through to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrictlyComeDancing?src=hashtag_click">#StrictlyComeDancing</a> final over Michelle Visage I will be absolutely FUMING."</p>
      <p>Another viewer penned: "How is Michelle behind Chris and Saffron? She did fantastic tonight".</p>
      <p>A third begged: "Everybody vote now for Michelle &amp; Giovanni please!! We can’t let them go now".</p>
