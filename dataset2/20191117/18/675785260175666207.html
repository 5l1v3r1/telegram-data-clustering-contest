      <h2>In the wake of Prince Andrew's interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis on Saturday night, questions have been raised about the Duke of York's place in the royal family when the Prince of Wales becomes king</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T18:23:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Tony Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew could find himself out of the core royal family in the wake of his car crash interview, an expert has suggested.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York sat down with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis for a lengthy interview about his relationship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein that was aired last night.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the lengthy conversation, in which the Prince failed to express sympathy for any of Epstein's victims, questions have been raised about Andrew's future in the royal family.</p>
      <p>Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the Duke could find himself out of the core royal family, if reports are correct that the monarchy will be slimmed down when Prince Charles becomes king.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was a very probing interview he's not used to being questioned in that way and I think he seemed unable to really answer her questions with any conviction.</p>

      <p>"I think myself and most other people think that the interview was a mistake.</p>
      <p>"I think the Duke of York is very anxious to carry on with the work that he's doing, but of course he's totally smeared by this Epstein business and until that is dealt with I think he's going to find it very hard to carry on as normal.</p>
      <p>"He will of course, because that's what people do, but I think it's always going to be in the background."</p>
      <p>She went on to say: "I think if there's a slimmed down monarchy I very much feel Andrew won't be a huge part in it."</p>
      <p>Andrew's attempt to set the record straight about his relationship with convicted sex offender Epstein - and counter allegations he slept with one of Epstein's groomed teenagers - has been widely condemned for its unsympathetic tone and lack of remorse for the friendship.</p>

      <p>Green Party co-leader Sian Berry told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that Andrew did not appear "very empathetic" with the teenage girls preyed on by the disgraced financier.</p>
      <p>The politician said: "The Me Too movement, it's thrown up so many incidents of women being exploited and abused by men in positions of power and when there are allegations like this they do need answering no matter who someone is."</p>
      <p>She added: "It wasn't a very empathetic interview, if that's an okay thing to say, with the victims, and I think he should have been more apologetic..."</p>
      <p>While many others expressed similar, critical thoughts, the Prince reportedly stood behind the decision to take part in the interview.</p>

      <p>People close to the Duke <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50450207">told the BBC</a> that he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with "honesty and humility".</p>
      <p>During the interview, Andrew twice stated his relationship with Epstein had some "seriously beneficial outcomes", giving him the opportunity to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>The Duke denied he slept with Virginia Giuffre on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage, as she alleged while under oath.</p>
      <p>Andrew said one encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>The same alleged sexual liaison, which the American said began with the royal sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp, was factually wrong as the duke said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.</p>
      <p>Anna Rothwell, from criminal law firm Corker Binning, questioned how sensible it was for Andrew to give the interview from a legal perspective. </p>
      <p>She said: "Prince Andrew is not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal family</a> .</p>
      <p>"His friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is under investigation by the FBI and he is vulnerable to extradition.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"It is therefore very unwise for the prince to give any account to the media, especially one which so starkly exposes the closeness of his relationship with Epstein, and again betrays yet another appalling lack of judgment."</p>
      <p>During his conversation with Ms Maitlis the royal also cast doubt on the authenticity of a picture that appears to show him with his arm around the waist of then teenage Mrs Giuffre.</p>
      <p>The royal said: "... from the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph.</p>
      <p>"So it's very difficult to be able to prove it but I don't remember that photograph ever being taken."</p>

      <p>The duke said the whole episode had not been damaging to the Queen, only to himself, and that the wider royal family "couldn't be more supportive".</p>
      <p>He expressed regret at making contact with Epstein in 2010 - flying to New York to say in person the friendship was over - after the 66-year-old had been released from an 18-month prison term for prostituting minors.</p>
      <p>But Maitlis highlighted how he spent a number of days with him at his home, and how he was guest of honour at a dinner party she said celebrated Epstein's release.</p>
