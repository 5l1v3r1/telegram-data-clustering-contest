        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/christine-mcguinness/">Christine McGuinness</a> and Danielle Armstrong had everyone stopping in their tracks as they arrived at the Float Like A Butterfly charity ball.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Celebrities flocked to the charity boxing event to show off their best looks as they raised money for Caudwell Children, an organisation which supports children with autism who need help in accessing their full potential.</p>
      <p>Christine left jaws hitting the floor as she posed in a semi-sheer metallic gown with a nude bodysuit underneath which kept everything PG.</p>
      <p>The star, who recently said she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/christine-mcguinness-not-proud-blue-badge-criticised-parking-disabled-spot-11039819/">‘not proud’ of having a blue badge</a> to park in a disabled spot, watched the amateur boxing match with husband Paddy at home with their children.</p>
      <p>The event also had the likes of Danielle, 31, gracing the red carpet as she showed off her growing baby bump in a simple green silk dress and curled hair.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She showed off her new man Tom, who wore a black suit and white shirt, after sharing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/towies-danielle-armstrong-announces-pregnant-first-baby-11055804/">news of her pregnancy</a> with her 1.2 million fans.</p>
      <p>Held at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, the star-studded event raised over £403,000 for the cause.</p>
      <p>The event also had Geordie Shore’s Holly Hagan, Melinda Messenger, Victoria Brown and Love Island’s Tyne-Lexy Clarson as guests.</p>

      <p>Holly, 27, put Jessica Rabbit to shame as she slayed in a red silk body con dress that flowed onto the floor.</p>
      <p>She accessorised with a simple sequin bag and necklace because who needs coats in two degree weather?</p>
      <p>According to the Charity’s website, the event includes ‘a champagne reception, the finest cuisines, white collar boxing, live entertainment and money can’t buy auction prizes.’</p>

      <p>Considering the amount of money earned, there must have been some top notch stuff up for auction.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, John Caudwell – chairman of the organisation – took to his Instagram story to thank people who donated huge sums of money.</p>
      <p>The businessman wrote: ‘Thanks to the generosity of those who pledged individual sums of £100,000, £25,000 and £5,000 tonight for Caudwell children.’</p>
