      <p>Multiple explosions were seen at bridges, with some protesters claiming that they were defensive moves to block police. The fires were later extinguished by firefighters.</p>

      <p>“The Police have repeatedly appealed to members of the public to leave immediately and to avoid travelling to the area. Officers will carry on with the dispersal operation and warn citizens not to enter or stay in the campus, or they will risk committing the offence of ‘Taking Part in a Riot,'” the force said in a statement.</p>

      <p>At around midnight, police warned that live rounds may be used as “minimum necessary force,” because officers have been attacked with petrol bombs, arrows and vehicles.</p>

      <p>PolyU issued an emergency statement calling on students and staff to evacuate its campus. University management appealed to students to stop violence and exercise restraint, adding that the school’s facilities had been seriously damaged.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The call was echoed in a joint statement from the heads of five universities – The University of Hong Kong, the University of Science and Technology, Baptist University, Polytechnic University and City University. They urged calm on all sides, and asked students, alumni and other individuals to leave the scene immediately.</p>

      <p>A post on the popular forum LIHKG claimed that many of the frontline protesters were on campus, and they would be arrested en masse if police forced their way in.</p>

      <p>On Sunday evening, protesters gathered in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Jordan and elsewhere in Kowloon as part of a “Blossom Everywhere” campaign – a bid to draw police attention away from PolyU.</p>

        <b>University encircled</b>
      </p>
      <p>At around 9:30pm, police announced that they would take further action against PolyU, and called on people on campus to “leave immediately via Block Y of Lee Shau Kee Building in Northern direction and listen to Police’s instructions.”</p>

      <p>As the night wore on, the former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind urged leader Carrie Lam to exercise restraint: “Hong Kong’s Chief Executive has the responsibility to do everything possible to prevent a massacre. She must order the police to exercise restraint and not to use live ammunition or other forms of lethal force. A bloodbath on a Hong Kong campus would be devastating for Hong Kong as a whole. I also urge those students who have engaged in violence to stop. I condemn violence on all sides and I call on both sides to show restraint and pull back from the brink.”</p>
