        <b>EURO 2020 Qualifier</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Luxembourg 0-2 Portugal</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 17 November 2019<br/><br/><b>Venue: </b>Stade Jose Barthel</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo moved onto 99 internationals as European champions Portugal defeated Luxembourg 2-0 to qualify for the 2020 European Championship on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The task was quite straightforward for the European champions, as three points would book their spot at next year's tournament regardless of other results.</p>
      <p>Portugal struggled to deal with the pitch in the early stages, which led to a lack of clear-cut chances as Ronaldo tried his luck from distance on a few occasions in the opening 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The deadlock was eventually broken in the 37th minute as Bernado Silva's ball over the top found Bruno Fernandes, who smashed the ball into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Silva nearly grabbed a goal of his own shortly before the halftime break, but the Manchester City star was unable to capitalise from close range after some good work by the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>The home side came out firing in the second half, with Fernandes going closest with a curling effort from the edge of the box in the opening 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to make the result safe, Portugal coach Fernando Santos threw on a double change as Joao Moutinho and Diogo Jota replaced Pizzi and Andre Silva.</p>
      <p>However, the win was sealed with three minutes remaining in the second half when Ronaldo poked the ball into an empty net after some good work by Jota the far post.</p>
