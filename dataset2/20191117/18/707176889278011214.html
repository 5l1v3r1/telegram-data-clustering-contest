      <p>The former boss of Eddie Stobart Andrew Tinkler is drawing up plans for a £75m rescue package for the UK logistics group, which is at risk of collapse without new cash to support its operations.</p>
      <p>Mr Tinkler, who ran the business as part of the Stobart Group until 2014, is planning an alternative offer to one <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1439e3cc-05ed-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">made</a> for Stobart last week from Dbay, a private equity group.</p>
      <p>The Dbay offer would invest £55m in cash through a high interest rate loan that would give essential funds to allow the debt-laden company to continue operating through the busy Christmas delivery period.</p>
      <p>It would also leave the Isle of Man-based investor in control of a subsidiary that would own the business, with existing shareholders holding a 49 per cent stake. That plan has upset some investors, according to one person close to the company.</p>
      <p>Mr Tinkler’s alternative would see a group of new and existing shareholders back a discounted rights issue to secure the necessary cash. Mr Tinkler has pledged up to £10m of his own money, according to one person briefed on the matter, who added that the former CEO had up to £40m of equity promised from new institutional investors.</p>
      <p>The person said Mr Tinkler had also spoken to existing shareholders in Eddie Stobart, who had indicated they would be willing to invest up to £25m in a rights issue to raise money to keep the company trading. Mr Tinkler has approached the Stobart Group, which still owns more than 10 per cent of the stock in Eddie Stobart, according to the person.</p>
      <p>The promise of a refinancing deal for Eddie Stobart would increase the options for the company’s board, which has also said the group’s net debt of about £200m is unsustainable.</p>
      <p>The Dbay offer has the advantage of being a quick process, given its structure as a loan. Logistics rival Wincanton has also been given <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5dd4660e-f172-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">more time</a> to table an offer.</p>
      <p>One person close to Eddie Stobart said the only concrete proposal so far was from Dbay, but that it would consider any other “fully formed” proposal.</p>
      <p>Any rights issue would need the company’s shares to resume trading. They have been suspended since the summer, when its chief executive stepped down and it delayed its interim results.</p>
      <p>Eddie Stobart’s auditor, PwC, has still not signed off the accounts, which would need to happen before shares started trading again. Any alternative deal would also need support from its lenders.</p>
      <p>In September, Eddie Stobart said it had received a “preliminary expression of interest” from Mr Tinkler, through his company TVFB, although no offer materialised.</p>
      <p>Eddie Stobart, Stobart Group and a representative for Mr Tinkler declined to comment.</p>
