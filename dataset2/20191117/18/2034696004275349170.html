      <p>The group – made up of Peter Morén, Björn Yttling and John Eriksson – recently announced they will be releasing their ninth studio album, ‘Endless Dream’ next year to coincide with their 20th anniversary. Due out March 13th via INGRID, news of the new album was accompanied by lead single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye6BA_IZEK8">‘Rusty Nail’</a>.</p>
      <p>Now delivering their second single, according to Morén, he was aiming for “a classic power-pop song with an updated PB&amp;J twist.”</p>
      <p>“It’s about when you’ve been in a relationship for a really long time, and you feel like it’s worth fighting for through the ups and downs,” he said in a press release. “That can be applied to the band, too — a really long thing that keeps on giving.”</p>
