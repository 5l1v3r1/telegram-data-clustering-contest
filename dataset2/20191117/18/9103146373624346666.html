        <b>UVF National Volleyball League</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nkumba <b>3</b> KCCA <b>0</b> (Nkumba won series 2-0)</p>
      <p>KCB-Nkumba University won the clubs second double in three years after they comprehensively beat KCCA at the Lugogo Arena on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>That title makes it seven championships by the university and the third they have won since 2017.</p>
      <p>Coach Tony Lakony was beyond impressed with his team as they cut their opponents to pieces in three well-earned sets.</p>
      <p>“It was a very good performance in the finals in game two. We started the playoffs in a very shaky way. We stepped up kept getting better today it was all systems go for us because blocks were super, serve was super reception was good and our attack was a little to match for them,” an excited Lakony said.</p>
      <p>With this result, Nkumba will be Uganda’s only female representatives at the Africa Club Championships early next year. They have won both the club championships and the league.</p>
      <p>KCCA although disappointed by the nature of the win are taking positives from this playoff run.</p>
      <p>“We did not win but at least we have achieved our targets after the semi-finals we made it to the finals. Next season we have to work on our reception both the frontcourt and the backcourt defence,” KCCA captain Joan Nabuto said.</p>
