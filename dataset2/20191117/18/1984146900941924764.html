      <p>The current <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-winner-odds-17262670">I'm A Celebrity odds</a> have football legend Ian Wright as favourite to win, but they're changing all the time.</p>
      <p>If you love the show, make sure you don't miss any of the jungle action.</p>
