      <p>DEFENDING CHAMPIONS ST Martin’s are heading for a replay after their Leinster final clash with Dublin’s St Vincent’s ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>The Wexford side, who contested the All-Ireland final earlier this year, played out a gripping contest against the Dublin side with the holders leading by just two points at half-time.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Amy Cardiff pushed their advantage out to three points shortly after the restart but Vincent’s soon found themselves back on level terms with Alison Maguire finding her range.</p>
      <p>The Dublin challengers went into a 0-10 to 0-9 lead inside the closing 10 minutes but Sarah O’Connor produced the equaliser to ensure the sides will have to meet again.</p>
      <p>The replay has been scheduled for next Sunday with a time and venue to be decided at a later date.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kate Kenny starred as Offaly’s St Rynagh’s emerged as comfortable winners in the intermediate final.</p>
      <p>St Rynagh’s dominated the final throughout, and were leading their Laois opponents Camross 2-15 to 0-2 at the break.</p>
      <p>Kenny finished with an impressive haul of 3-5 as her side emerged as 4-23 to 0-4 winners.</p>
