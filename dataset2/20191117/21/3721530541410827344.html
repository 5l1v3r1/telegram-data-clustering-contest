      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/rainbow-six/707"><i>Rainbow Six</i></a><i> Siege</i>’s Year 4, Season 4 debut is coming soon. “Shifting Tides” as it is called, is already on public test servers for PC (having been in place since Monday) which portends a launch across all platforms. And it brings out a big-ass gun, the likes of which we haven’t seen since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufH4eZ7sF_I">Danny Vermin’s .88 magnum</a>.</p>
      <p>The CSRX 300 is the first bolt-action rifle in <i>Siege</i>, carried by Kali, a new operator who also comes aboard with the update. A round from the CSRX 300 can penetrate seven layers of standard walls. Its under-barrel gadget can go through reinforced walls. Here’s a video demonstration of her capabilities, along with Wamai, a defender who also joins the game.</p>

      <p>But, getting back to the original point, <i>Siege</i>’s firearms will across-the-board be able to, erm, penetrate limbs and bodies more than ever, hence the Danny Vermin (“goes through, armor, the victim … a tree outside,”) reference. That means skilled operators can take down more than one target with one shot. To show how serious Ubisoft Montreal is about this, they <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-358510-16/dev-blog-limb-penetration-system">put out a development blog last week</a> detailing the difference between “no penetration,” “simple penetration” and “full penetration,” and now I feel like I’m perusing the periodicals at Castle Video &amp; News in Raleigh.</p>

      <p>What it means is that most guns will be able to shoot through a limb and hit another point on the target, potentially causing greater damage. DMRs and sniper rifles can go through a target and hit the guy behind them.</p>
      <p>Joining Wamai, Kali, and the new bullet physics for Shifting Tides will be a reworked Theme Park map, <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/shiftingtides/index.aspx">says Ubisoft</a>, plus the usual rebalances and bug fixes. Seven Operators are also getting a price drop (in the in-game currencies). As for operator changes, Jackal is the only one getting a makeover, though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/duv5d3/year_4_season_4_operation_shifting_tides_patch/f78nid7/">a Ubisoft community rep says</a> there are “a few more surprises coming.”</p>
