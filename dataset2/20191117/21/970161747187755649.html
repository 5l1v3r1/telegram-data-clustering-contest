      <p>Lyra (Dafne Keen) has been dealt a hell of a lot of problems ever since leaving Jordan College in Oxford and heading with Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson) to London in His Dark Materials.</p>
      <p>But today might have been the hardest one yet, as it becomes clear that danger is going to follow Lyra wherever she goes, no matter how hard she tries to escape.</p>
      <p>Not only that, the people who have meant to be looking after her this whole time have well and truly dropped the ball – and might even be in the running to be worst parents ever.</p>
      <p>(Honestly…apart from the Gyptians, adults in this world are the actual worst.)</p>
      <p>But with another week down, there’s still a hell of a lot to uncover, and now we know how the alethiometer works, and the story heads North, we know it’s going to get interesting.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Here’s everything we need to know the answers to next episode…</p>

      <h3>What exactly are the Gobblers doing with the kids?</h3>
      <p>We know that Coulter has come up with a plan of constantly moving them around to avoid detection…but we can’t help but feel the actual purpose of stealing them in the first place is a little lost in translation.</p>
      <p>It may have been mentioned last episode, but if it was it was fleetingly, and now we’re scratching our heads wondering exactly why the kids were stolen and what they’re doing while they’re in captivity.</p>
      <p>We’re going to need this answered soon, seeing as we’re going to want to get Roger back and he’s been missing since the first episode.</p>
      <h3>Who is Colonel John Parry?</h3>
      <p>Presumed dead about 13 years ago, supporting ‘an environmental thing in Alaska’, it doesn’t take a genius to know that Colonel John Parry is a man to take note of.</p>
      <p>For starters, he’s being played by Andrew Scott – and you don’t just check him in as a photo cameo, especially considering that we already knew he was becoming a full-time cast member.</p>
      <p>When he disappeared, the commando left behind a wife and a child. A wife whose medical records reveal a long history of mental health problems.</p>
      <p>So what was he up to that was so important he needed to leave? Or is he just a guy that had had enough and done a runner?</p>

      <h3>Why is Lyra so important?</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>We know she’s part of a prophecy, and we know that after years of thinking her parents were dead, she discovered the much sadder fact that they were just liars.</p>
      <p>It was also forewarned she was going to have to betray Lord Asriel (James McAvoy).</p>
      <p>But everyone seems to know something about her that they shouldn’t know, and she’s (very rightly) struggling to trust anyone at this point.</p>
      <p>So why is she so important, and why has it decided to trigger now?</p>
      <h3>Where the hell is Asriel?</h3>
      <p>Seriously, he has been the worst.</p>
      <p>Going off to investigate Dust, he caused so much trouble just by his appearance in Oxford and then buggered off again for everyone else to deal with.</p>
      <p>We know he’s meant to be discovering things or whatever, but he’s basically coming across as a responsibility dodging, cold hearted menace at this point.</p>
      <p>Every time he’s appeared in Lyra’s life it’s ended in disaster, but surely even he’s not aware how much he’s messed up this time.</p>
      <p>Don’t be waiting for a phone call from Father of the Year, will you mate?</p>

      <h3>What does Coulter want with Lyra?</h3>
      <p>Coulter’s not exactly the nicest person in the world and now it turns out to add insult to injury she’s Lyra’s mother as well.</p>
      <p>Honestly, how this girl has not just rage quit the entire area is beyond us, considering the amount of secrets about her people are hiding.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>But the problem with it all is, while she apparently turned cold <i>after</i> having the affair that resulted in Lyra, she’s downright evil now.</p>
      <p>She seems to be hellbent on killing Lyra, or at least stopping her doing something in someway, and is taking down anyone who suggests otherwise.</p>
      <p>Seriously, what’s your damage Coulter? And why is Lyra so important to whatever scheme you’re cooking up?</p>
