      <p>BALTIMORE -- <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> delivered another MVP performance while etching his name in the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>' record book once again.</p>
      <p>In Sunday's <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game/_/gameId/401128047">41-7 rout</a> of the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a>, Jackson became the first player in Ravens history to produce multiple games with four touchdown passes. On his scores, Jackson connected with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17402/seth-roberts">Seth Roberts</a> (15 yards), <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews">Mark Andrews</a> (18 yards) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13981/mark-ingram-ii">Mark Ingram</a> (25 and 12 yards).</p>
      <p>Jackson threw five touchdown passes in the season opener at Miami.</p>
      <p>The Ravens (8-2) extended their winning streak to six games, the longest current one in the NFL. Baltimore is now within a half-game of New England for the top seed in the AFC.</p>
      <p>Overcoming a shaky first quarter (1-for-6 for 12 yards), Jackson got in a groove, completing 13 straight passes. That's the fourth-longest streak in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Jackson also hurt the Texans with his legs, rushing for 86 yards. His best run was a 39-yarder in which he made five Texans defenders miss.</p>
      <p>Jackson, who was 17-of-24 for 222 yards (139.2 rating), outplayed <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a> after doing the same against <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a>, another MVP candidate, on Oct. 20.</p>
