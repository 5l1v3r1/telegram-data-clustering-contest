      <h1>1998 Toyota Supra Asking Price Is Beyond Ridiculous</h1>
      <h2>But it may not be as high as you think. Read on.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:40:53+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The fourth-generation <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/toyota/supra">Toyota Supra</a>, particular the Supra Turbo, has been highly sought after for years. And ever since the Supra made its triumphant return almost a year ago, some Mark IV Supra values have further increased. Of course, those examples with sometimes six-figure price tags are in perfect, stock condition with very few miles. It's easy to see why collectors want one in their garages. But how high can those Supra prices get?</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/another-1994-toyota-supra-sells-for-insane-money">someone paid over $173,000</a> for one, at the time a potential new high. But all records are made to be broken. This 1998 Toyota Supra Turbo is being advertised for â€“ wait for it - $499,999. Yes, seriously.</p>

      <p>The Supra Turbo in question has only 37,257 miles on its clock and is being offered for sale, via <a href="https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/60090373">Carsforsale.com</a>, by San Diego, California dealership Iconic Coach. Powered by the desirable twin-turbocharged 2ZJ engined paired to a six-speed manual transmission, this Supra feature '98 model year-only Quicksilver exterior paint and a black leather interior.</p>
      <p>It's had the same owner for the past 15 years and it retains the original VIN tags on all body panels. But half a million dollars? Seriously? Turns out that price tag may not be the reality. With such a high advertised price, an advertisement like this is sure to get some intention. Hey, it caught ours.</p>

      <p>And when the dealership gets attention, it typically gets business. Nothing wrong with that. Also, dealerships typically insure their vehicles, especially those that are rare. This Supra counts. But the dealership insurance is only active if the vehicle in question is for sale, so advertising it for a ton of money to keep it insured is probably what's going on here. And if they're extremely lucky, some sucker will pay close to asking price. Anybody who's in the market for a Mark IV Supra Turbo will have advanced knowledge as to what one is truly worth.</p>
