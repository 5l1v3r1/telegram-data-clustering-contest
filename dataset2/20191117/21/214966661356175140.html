      <p>Firefighters across Queensland are bracing for another tough day, despite weather conditions easing.</p>
      <p>More than 70 bushfires continue to burn across the state, although cooler conditions today may be able to give crews the chance to get the upper hand on a number of blazes.</p>
      <p>The main fire of concern continues to be at Pechey, north of Toowoomba, with residents being told to prepare to leave.</p>
      <p>A large blaze at Tarome in the Scenic Rim is also threatening the area, with locals being told to leave now.</p>
      <p>“An unpredictable fire is continuing to travel in an easterly direction towards Tarome,”QFES warned on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>“Follow your bushfire survival plan now. If you do not have a plan, your safest option is to leave now if it is clear to do so. If you are not in the area, do not return, as conditions are too dangerous.”</p>
      <p>Crews are continuing to monitor two blazes burning in the Gold Coast hinterland.</p>
      <p>The fires at Lower Beechmont and Binna Burra are still burning within containment lines and not threatening any properties at this stage.</p>
      <p>The fire danger rating for the Gold Coast remains at ‘high’ today, however will ramp up to ‘very high’ tomorrow through to Thursday.</p>
