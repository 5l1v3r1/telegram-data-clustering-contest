      <h1>Donald Trump hails 'cash' payout to farmers, US aid in China trade war</h1>

      <p>US President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>on Sunday welcomed a "cash" payout to American farmers before the Thanksgiving Day holiday that he attributed to China tariffs, but that money actually is part of a US government aid package.</p>
      <p>"Our great Farmers will recieve (sic) another major round of 'cash,' compliments of China Tariffs, prior to Thanksgiving," he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"The smaller farms and farmers will be big beneficiaries. In the meantime, and as you may have noticed, China is starting to buy big again. Japan deal DONE. Enjoy!"</p>
      <p>The US Department of Agriculture said on Friday it will begin making a second round of 2019 trade aid payments to US farmers next week.</p>
      <p>The payments are the second part of a three-tranche $16 billion aid package announced in May to compensate farmers for the US-China trade war. China imposed tariffs on key US agriculture exports including soybeans and pork last year after Trump's administration levied duties on Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>The United States and China are trying to negotiate a phase one trade pact to end the tensions, but it is unclear when it might be finalised.</p>
