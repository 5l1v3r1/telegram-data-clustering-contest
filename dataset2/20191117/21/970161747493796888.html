      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here! kicked off with some cheeky opening banter from hosts Ant and Dec, as they made digs about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s rumoured fee for appearing on the show.</p>
      <p>Reports from earlier this month claimed that Caitlyn, 70, is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/caitlyn-jenner-confirmed-im-celebrity-2019-shock-signing-11028866/">set to pocket a reported £500,000</a> for going into the jungle, said to be one of the largest fees the show has ever handed out.</p>
      <p>The presenters joked that while most celebs go into the jungle to lose pounds, Caitlyn will in fact be gaining ‘500,000 of them’.</p>
      <p>Introducing this year’s line-up, Dec said: ‘We’ve got reality TV royalty Caitlyn Jenner. Most people come into the jungle to lose a few pounds…’</p>
      <p>Ant added: ‘But she’s going to be gaining 500,000 of them according to the papers.’</p>
      <p>Dec told him: ‘Don’t believe everything you read in the papers, Ant. You know that.’</p>

      <p>Just before the camp mates were introduced, Ant told viewers: ‘I’m A Celebrity 2019 can only have one winner.’</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn Jenner’s agent by the sound of it,’ Dec joked.</p>
      <p>‘Okay, two winners,’ Ant said.</p>

      <p>A source told The Sun about Caitlyn’s signing: ‘It’s a real bolt from the blue. They’ve asked her every year for a long time, but she finally felt the time was right.’</p>
