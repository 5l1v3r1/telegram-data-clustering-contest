      <h1>APC praises security agencies for Kogi, Bayelsa elections marred by violence, vote-buying, others</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:46:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/363840-apc-praises-security-agencies-for-kogi-bayelsa-elections-marred-by-violence-vote-buying-others.html" target="_blank">Ayodeji Adegboyega</a></address>
      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the violence-ridden governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>Both states held their governorship elections on Saturday. A senatorial election was also held in the Kogi West senatorial district.</p>
      <p>Based on the official results announced so far for the elections, the APC is set to coast to victory in the elections.</p>
      <p>Most major local and international observers who monitored the elections have condemned the level of violence by both state and non-state actors during the elections.</p>
      <p>At least two local observer groups, YIAGA and Situation Room, have even called for the outright cancellation of the Kogi election.</p>
      <p>The APC, in its reaction to the elections, however, hailed “security agencies for the security arrangements put in place for Saturday’s Governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States.”</p>

      <p>Bayelsa, Kogi Election Results: APC Urges Members to Remain Calm, Peaceful</p>
      <p>Hails Security Agencies on Election Security</p>
      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) hails our security agencies for the security arrangements put in place for Saturday’s Governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States.</p>
      <p>We are aware of several hoodlums brought into Kogi State from Osun and Oyo States few days before the elections, just as we monitored the grand preparation to unleash violence in Bayelsa State. We are delighted that the forces of darkness have failed. The subterfuge deployed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to rig the election in both states, including the Kogi West senatorial rerun election was thwarted.</p>
      <p>In Kogi and Bayelsa states, we were certain of securing the majority votes for the two governorship seats and the Kogi West senatorial seat. For this, we knew we must ensure a peaceful atmosphere for voters to freely turn out and exercise their franchise. As expected, not being in the tradition of PDP to thrive under orderly and credible electoral process, they did their best to discredit the process. We are glad that the voting processes came to a successful end in Kogi and Bayelsa states.</p>
      <p>The Party thanks security agencies and other officials who did their best to minimize the impact of the PDP thugs whose sole agenda was to create chaos and scare voters from coming out to vote. Of course, the PDP did not achieve their objective of winning through violence.</p>
      <p>We note the effort by the PDP to employ their usual manipulation through ballot box snatching, massive thumb printing of ballot papers and vote buying. We also note for instance the video now in circulation of self-help ballot paper thumb printing at the polling unit of the PDP governorshop candidate, Musa Wada and vote buying by the PDP’s Senatorial candidate, Dino Melaye.</p>
      <p>We thank all our supporters for standing their ground to protect the ballot and ensure credibility of the electoral process. While we wait for the collation process to complete and for the final results to be announced, we urge our members in both states to remain calm and peaceful.</p>
