        <b>Judd Trump turned in another cracking display to beat Ronnie O’Sullivan 9-7 in the final of the Northern Ireland, in a repeat of last year’s tournament.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The world number one dominated the contest against the five-time world champion, leading for the entire contest after winning the first frame.</p>
      <p>The world champ made four centuries (123, 106, 113 and 124) and six more half-centuries over an engaging contest, while the Rocket made two tons of his own, including a 135 in the 15th frame.</p>
      <p>‘It’s amazing, it’s always hard to defend any title, but to do it against Ronnie, amazing,’ said Trump after clinching the title for a second time.</p>
      <p>‘The game was free-flowing, he was scoring heavy, I was scoring heavy so I think it was good to watch as well.’</p>
      <p>The final was a ridiculously high standard throughout as Trump seemed in control throughout but O’Sullivan produced moments of absolute brilliance as he tried to keep up with the world champion.</p>

      <p>Trump took a 2-0 lead in quick time, with a half-century in each, but it was the Rocket who made the first ton of the contest, with a 126 in the third.</p>
      <p>The world champion hit back immediately to that effort, though, and produced a very difficult 123 in the fourth to re-open a two-frame lead.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan made a classy 89 to win the fifth but the world number one was calm and remained in command, winning the sixth with two half-centuries and then getting 11 reds into a maximum break before breaking down on 88.</p>
      <p>The Rocket pinched the last frame of the first session to stay in touching distance at 5-3, but was still just hanging on in there.</p>
      <p>A scrappy first frame of the evening was taken by Ronnie to go back within one, but Trump was doing brilliantly to keep him at bay, knocking in breaks of 106 and 113 to win the next two and go 7-4 ahead. The 113 was another maximum chance, but Judd missed the final black of the possible 147.</p>
      <p>Things looked desperate for the Rocket at this point but his class never diminishes and he went 72 points into a 147 attempt of his own, before breaking down, but still taking the 12th frame, before a 76 clearance in the next to again go within one.</p>
      <p>The immense quality of the pair was shown in the next two frames as Trump made 124 to go one frame from victory before O’Sullivan made a mammoth 135 to keep his hopes alive.</p>
      <p>However, the Juddernaut put his foot down again, making 84 to win the match 9-7.</p>
