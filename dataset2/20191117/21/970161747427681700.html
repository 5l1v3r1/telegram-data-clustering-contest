      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-and-dec/">Ant and Dec</a> kicked off <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!</a> by making a dig at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> and fans are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/didnt-ant-im-celebrity-last-year-holly-willoughby-11171456/">thrilled to have the pair back</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Ten celebrities, all of them very nervous, all of them sweating,’ Ant said.</p>
      <p>‘Presuming they can sweat, not everyone can,’ Dec added with a cheeky smirk on his face.</p>
      <p>The joke comes in reference to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">Saturday night’s interview</a> with Prince Andrew on Newsnight, in which the royal family member and close friend of Jeffrey Epstein claimed that he couldn’t have been the man to sleep with Virginia Giuffre, an underage girl, because the man she described was sweaty <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">whereas he ‘couldn’t sweat.</a>’</p>
      <p>He claimed: ‘I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat.’</p>

      <p>Um, sure.</p>
      <p>But despite the dark subject matter of the interview, I’m A Celebrity viewers were overjoyed to see Ant and Dec take the mick out of the ridiculous royal, saying that it showed a true return to form for the duo after Ant’s year off from the show.</p>

      <p>‘Massive lol at Ant &amp; Dec making a Prince Andrew sweating joke within the first 10 seconds of #ImACeleb,’ one fan tweeted, adding the hashtag: ‘#sweatgate.’</p>
      <p>‘Two prince andrew puns and it’s barely been ten minutes, ant &amp; dec are the royal commentators we always needed,’ another joked.</p>

      <p>Never ones to turn down a chance to milk a joke, the pair returned to the sweating puns, with Dec asking about the second team of celebs to arrive in the jungle.</p>
      <p>‘Will those celebrities be A) confident, B) excited, or C) absolutely sweating?’ Dec asked, with his pal jumping in: ‘Presuming they can sweat.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Presuming they can,’ Dec repeated, ‘Not everybody can.’</p>
      <p>We sense a theme coming…</p>
