        <b>SIR Rod Stewart has revealed the romp that inspired No1 hit Maggie May lasted just four seconds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The legendary former ladies’ man, 74, admitted he was 16 when he lost his virginity in a tent to an older woman — and it was a flop.</p>

      <p>He later penned the 1971 smash about his deflating experience at the Beaulieu jazz festival in Hampshire.</p>
      <p>Rod said: “I don’t know what her name was, I just called her Maggie May so she’ll never know.</p>

      <p>“It all happened in a tent in about four seconds. That was my first encounter with a female, sexually-wise — four seconds.”</p>
      <p>Maggie May became Rod’s first big solo hit on both sides of the Atlantic, topping the UK charts for five weeks.</p>
      <p>But Rod revealed record label bosses didn’t rate it because of its lack of chorus.</p>
      <p>He told Radio Scotland: “I played it to them and they said ‘where’s the sing-along bit in the middle?’</p>
      <h3>Flop of the Pops</h3>
      <p>Life in the Fast Lay - Eagles</p>
      <p>All You Speed is Love - Beatles</p>
      <p>Jumpin' Jack Dash - Rolling Stones</p>
      <p>Pumped Up Quicks - Foster the People</p>
      <p>...or anything by Blur</p>
      <p>“I said ‘there’s no chorus, it just rambles on’. But they put it on the album.”</p>
      <p>Despite the tent disaster, the singer is famed for his popularity with the ladies.</p>
      <p>He has eight kids with five women but is happily wed to third wife Penny, 48.</p>
      <p>The Celtic fan also said <a href="http://bit.ly/2qlrojf">twice-weekly footie matches tamed his party lifestyle</a>.</p>
      <p>He added: “I couldn’t do drugs and drink too much, because it would have ruined my game.</p>
      <p>“Football saved me. It’s helped me so much and I miss not playing.”</p>
