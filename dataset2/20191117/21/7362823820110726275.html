      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">stolen ring</a> once belonging to the famed Irish writer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/oscar-wildes-silver-cigarette-case-surfaces-up-for-auction">Oscar Wilde</a> has been recovered nearly 20 years after it was stolen from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">Britain’s Oxford University</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Arthur Brand, a Dutchman nicknamed the “Indiana Jones of the Art World” for successfully recovering high-profile stolen artworks, used his connections in the underworld to track down Wilde’s ring, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/oscar-wildes-stolen-ring-found-dutch-art-detective-091403182.html">AFP reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The ring, which Wilde gave to a fellow student in 1876, was stolen during a burglary in 2002 at Oxford’s Magdalen College. At the time, the ring was worth about $45,000.</p>

      <p>The burglary remained unsolved for years, with fears that the ring – made from 18-carat gold – may have been melted down.</p>

      <p>“We had given up hope of seeing it again,” Mark Blandford-Baker, Magdalen College’s home bursar, told AFP.</p>
      <p>He said the university was “very pleased to have back a stolen item that forms part of a collection relating to one of our more famous alumni.”</p>

      <p>The ring is set to make its return to Magdalen College in a formal ceremony on Dec. 4.</p>
