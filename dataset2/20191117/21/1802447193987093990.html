      <p>Only one quarterback has three 400-yard passing games this season. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/3118/aaron-rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> hasn’t done it. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12142/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> hasn’t done it. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12151/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a> hasn’t done it. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/7460/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> hasn’t done it. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13059/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> hasn’t done it.</p>
      <p>Maybe it’s time to put <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11318/dak-prescott">Dak Prescott</a>‘s name in the MVP watch list.</p>
      <p>Prescott threw for 444 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-27 victory over the Lions that was closer than it should have been.</p>
      <p>In the past two games, Prescott has 841 passing yards to set a team record to go with six touchdowns and an interception.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys, who entered as the top offense in the league, had 505 total yards. <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13149/michael-gallup">Michael Gallup</a> caught nine passes for 148 yards, and <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/6497/randall-cobb">Randall Cobb</a> had four receptions for 115 yards.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11265/ezekiel-elliott">Ezekiel Elliott</a> lost a fumble on his first carry but finished with 45 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries and caught two passes for 28 yards and a score. His backup, rookie <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/14245/tony-pollard">Tony Pollard</a>, had six touches for 56 yards and a score.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys couldn’t put the Lions away until late, though, allowing Detroit to gain 312 yards as <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/11340/jeff-driskel">Jeff Driskel</a> passed for 209 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>The Lions reached the Dallas 32 with 3:01 remaining and down only eight points. But Detroit was penalized for an ineligible player downfield, threw an incompletion and Michael Bennett sacked Driskel, forcing the Lions to punt on fourth-and-26. (The Lions then had a delay of game, making it fourth-and-31.)</p>
      <p>Detroit never got the ball back, unable to stop Prescott and the Cowboys, who moved to 6-4 on the season. The Cowboys are a half game ahead of the Eagles, who are taking on the Patriots now. Dallas travels to New England next week.</p>
      <p>Dallas did lose right tackle <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/10371/lael-collins">La'el Collins</a> to a left knee injury late in the game. He was replaced by <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/9615/cameron-fleming">Cameron Fleming</a>.</p>
      <p>Lions fullback <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13333/nick-bawden">Nick Bawden</a> left with a knee injury and cornerback <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12376/jamal-agnew">Jamal Agnew</a> with an ankle injury.</p>
