      <p>World champion Marc Marquez has taken the Valencia GP with a superb performance for his 12th victory of the season to ensure Repsol Honda win the teams’ world title.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, who began the day behind Petronas Yamaha’s pole-sitter Fabio Quartararo, overtook the French rookie with a skillful move in the eighth lap and never looked back to finish the race in 41 minutes, 21.469 seconds.</p>
      <p>Quartararo finished second, 1.026 seconds behind Spaniard Marquez, while Australia’s Jack Miller was third for the non-works Pramac Ducati team.</p>

      <p>Marquez, who won his sixth world title last month, recovered from an early fall to top the warm-up session earlier in the day but looked unstoppable in the race despite a slow start. Victory meant the Repsol Honda team captured the teams' championship ahead of Ducati, in addition to the constructors’ title, for a memorable triple crown.</p>
