      <h1>Child abuse victims should have right to sue paedophiles caught with images of them, children charities say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:30:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/mike-wright/" target="_blank">Mike Wright</a></address>
      <p>Child abuse victims should be given new rights to sue paedophiles caught viewing or sharing indecent images of them, children charities have said.</p>
      <p>The Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety (CCCIS) called for the initiative arguing it would act as a deterrent for offenders, who now know they are unlikely to go do jail, as it could mean potentially losing their homes and pensions if caught with abuse material.</p>
      <p>The CCCIS, which represents charities such as the NSPCC and Barnardo’s, said those convicted of indecent images should also face a new automatic surcharge to fund the treatment and therapy costs of victims of abuse.</p>
      <p>The call comes as police have previously said they are struggling to cope with the now more than 5,000 arrests being made for indecent images every year.</p>
      <p>Police chiefs have argued that<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/02/low-level-paedophiles-could-avoid-jail-terms-new-guidance/"> some paedophiles caught with indecent images could be dealt with by conditional cautions </a>to lighten the caseload.</p>
      <p> John Carr OBE, Secretary of the CCCIS, said : "If you assume these offenders are rational, they must know that the chances of them being caught, convicted and sent to jail are very close to zero.</p>
      <p>"But if they knew that if they were caught their house, their car, their pension, their assets could be at risk as they are obliged to pay compensation to the victims, that would act as a major deterrent.</p>
      <p>"Why should the taxpayer pick up the entire bill (for victim treatment) if the guys who are responsible can fund it? We’ve got the phrase ‘the polluter pays’ - here we want the abuser to pay."</p>
      <p>Victims of child abuse can currently sue their abusers through the civil courts, however their rights regarding people caught with images or recordings of their abuse are far less clear.</p>
      <p>The CCCIS, said that explosion in abuse images being shared on the internet was causing long-lasting trauma to victims whose abuse had been recorded.</p>
      <p>Last year the US-based watchdog, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said it received reports of 18 million images worldwide being shared across major tech platforms, including 16 million just from Facebook.</p>
      <p>The CCCIS also argued an automatic surcharge should be levied on the growing numbers of people caught with images, on top of the current victim surcharge, which would fund care for victims.</p>
      <p>Currently all people convicted in UK courts pay a victim surcharge of up to £181, the proceeds of which are dispersed among various victims' charities.</p>
      <p>Mr Carr added: "The victims of sexual abuse are completely clear and know that those images are circulating on the internet and being downloaded. Some of these young people will have that pain and burden the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>"That is a huge source of stress and anxiety for them, and so the who business of downloading needs to be discouraged and stopped."</p>
