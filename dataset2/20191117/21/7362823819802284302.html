      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-culpo-flaunts-physique-in-beach-photos">Olivia Culpo</a> isn't ready to let go of the sun.</p>
      <p>The model, who <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-culpo-bali-bikini-pics">just wrapped up a vacation in Bali</a>, is yearning for warmer weather. She posted a picture of herself lounging in a bathing suit in St. Barth.</p>
      <p>"Gimme that back please!" Culpo captioned the series of pics.</p>

      <p>It was recently announced that the model will return for her third year in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, set to hit stands in 2020.</p>
      <p>Back in February, Culpo <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-culpo-2019-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-photo-shoot">opened up to Fox News about how she prepares</a> for the big photoshoots, including her "really strict diet."</p>
      <p>"No sugar. No carbs. No alcohol," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-culpo-2019-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-photo-shoot">she said</a>. "Basically, all protein and fiber, and the only kinds of carbs I'll have is sweet potato or greens or fruit."</p>

      <p>Despite watching what she eats ahead of photoshoots, Culpo said diets aren't something she strictly follows in her normal day-to-day life.</p>
      <p>"I really don't believe in dieting," she said. "I notice that when I have a shoot coming up or when I'm being really diligent about my diet, I can pretty much do it up until the day or two before and then I start to go crazy, and basically self-sabotage myself. As soon as I tell myself I can't have sweets, then I really want sweets."</p>

      <p>Culpo -- who loves indulging in ice cream, pizza "and/or" alcohol -- also credits her fitness routine to allowing her to splurge whenever she wants.</p>
      <p>"I love working out," she said. "I feel like if I didn't work out as much as I did, I probably wouldn't be able to get away with eating the way that I eat, so for me, it works out well."</p>
