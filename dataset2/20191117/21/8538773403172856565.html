      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a> quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/11237/matt-ryan">Matt Ryan</a> moved past Warren Moon for 10th place on the all-time passing list with his performance in Sunday's <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/game?gameId=401128049">29-3 win</a> at the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>.</p>
      <p>Ryan entered the game with 49,072 passing yards, behind Moon's 49,325. He finished the game with 311 yards and a touchdown on 21-of-31 passing.</p>
      <p>Ryan, 34, is expected to become the 10th player to reach 50,000 yards at some point this season. John Elway is above Ryan on the all-time list at ninth with 51,475 yards.</p>
      <p>The other players to surpass 50,000 yards are: <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a>, Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Dan Marino, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5529/philip-rivers">Philip Rivers</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5536/ben-roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5526/eli-manning">Eli Manning</a>. Only Brees, Brady, Peyton Manning and Favre have surpassed 70,000 passing yards.</p>
      <p>Ryan's strong performance Sunday helped the Falcons race out to a 20-0 halftime lead. He completed 14-of-20 passes for 215 yards and a passer rating of 105.2 in the first half.</p>
      <p>The 2016 MVP was particularly strong throwing the deep ball, completing 4-of-5 passes for 127 yards on passes thrown 15-plus yards down the field in the first half. He connected with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones">Julio Jones</a> for a 48-yard pickup and connected with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925357/calvin-ridley">Calvin Ridley</a> for 34 yards.</p>
      <p>Ryan's strong play on offense, and an incredibly strong effort by the defense, sparked the Falcons. Atlanta intercepted Panthers quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115293/kyle-allen">Kyle Allen</a> four times and sacked him four times going into the final minutes of the game.</p>
