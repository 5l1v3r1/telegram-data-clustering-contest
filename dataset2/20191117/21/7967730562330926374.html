      <p>Max Verstappen won a thrilling Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix for Red Bull on Sunday after the Ferraris collided and Mercedes' six-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was demoted from third to seventh.</p>
      <p>Verstappen controlled nearly all the race at Interlagos, which saw a dramatic late collision between Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc when fighting for fourth position. Both failed to finish.</p>
      <p>Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly got his first F1 podium after finishing second ahead of Hamilton.</p>

      <p>However, Hamilton was relegated to seventh position after receiving a five- second penalty for an incident that caused Red Bull's Alexander Albon to spin, with McLaren's Carlos Sainz replacing the Mercedes driver in the top three.</p>
      <p>Australia's Daniel Ricciardo subsequently moved up to sixth, with Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi being upgraded to fourth and fifth respectively.</p>
      <p>"I massively apologise to Albon," said Hamilton. "Completely my fault."</p>

      <p>Dutch driver Verstappen said: "Lewis was very quick so I had to keep pushing ... we had two good moves with him, and from there onward I could control the race."</p>
      <p>The Brazilian GP on Sunday was the penultimate race of the season, with only Abu Dhabi left on December 1.</p>
      <p>Hamilton had already secured the season title in the previous race in the United States. His Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who did not finish in Brazil, had also secured the runner-up spot.</p>
