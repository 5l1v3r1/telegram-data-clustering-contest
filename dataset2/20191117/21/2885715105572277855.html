      <h1>Delhi Confidential: Visit To Veterans</h1>
      <h2>A day ahead of the winter session of Parliament, Birla decided to meet veteran Parliamentarians who have not been keeping well.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:20:58+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>HAVING GOT cooperation from members of the Lok Sabha to sit long hours in the previous session, Speaker Om Birla appears to have decided to walk that extra mile to signal that he cares for the members. A day ahead of the winter session of Parliament, Birla decided to meet veteran Parliamentarians who have not been keeping well. Keeping aside the protocol of Speaker, Birla on Sunday drove down to the residence of veteran MP <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mulayam-singh-yadav">Mulayam Singh Yadav</a> to enquire about his health. He also drove to the residence of Union minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ram-vilas-paswan">Ram Vilas Paswan</a>, who has been recuperating from a fractured leg, to enquire about his health. Incidentally, both Yadav and Paswan started their legislative careers — from respective state assemblies — five decades ago, and it was an opportunity for the Speaker to exchange views with the veterans.</p>

        <b>Art On Display</b>
      </p>
      <p>PRESIDENT RAM Nath Kovind on Sunday witnessed an exhibition of paintings set up by the Artists-in-Residence at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The President also felicitated the artists after visiting the exhibition. The paintings, on display at the exhibition, were made by the Artists-in-Residence during their week-long stay at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Under the In-Residence programme, the artists stayed within the Rashtrapati Bhavan premises from November 10 to 17 this year. The distinguished artists included Krishen Khanna, Ganesh Haloi, Anjolie Ela Menon, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Sanat Kar, Arpita Singh, Paramjit Singh, Suhas Bahulkar, Chandra Bhattacharjee, Anwar Khan, Sanjay Bhattacharya, and Chinmay Roy — and young artists Siddarth Shingade, Parnita Parveen Bora and Vimmi Indra.</p>

        <b>Thorough Check</b>
      </p>
      <p>IT HAS been over two weeks since the search-cum-selection committee interviewed shortlisted candidates for the post of director at IIT-Kharagpur. Earlier, the norm was to send the name of the one candidate selected by the committee to the President for formal appointment the same day itself. However, after HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal took charge, the search-cum-selection committee doesn’t select one candidate but sends a panel of three to five names. After this, the minister selects one and forwards it to the ministry. The buzz is that the minister’s office does its own background check of the shortlisted candidates before selecting one. This is why the ministry hasn’t sent the name of the selected candidate to the President’s office yet although the interview took place more than two weeks ago.</p>
