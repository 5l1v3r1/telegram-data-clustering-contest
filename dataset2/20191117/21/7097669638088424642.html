      <h1>American Submarines Are in the Crosshairs of China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Lyle J. Goldstein</a></address>
      <p>China has been steadily improving its anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities to cope with a perceived, major asymmetry in undersea warfare capabilities. Additionally, when Beijing began filling out its navy with major surface combatants, including aircraft carriers, cruisers and now large amphibious attack ships, there has been a rather visible and understandable uptick in Chinese attempts to protect these new investments from submarine attack.</p>
      <p>Some of these developments in Chinese ASW over the last decade have included building a formidable force of light frigates that are equipped with towed sonar arrays,<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/its-missile-its-torpedo-its-chinas-new-anti-submarine-weapon-17374"> fielding</a> a vertically launched “rocket torpedo” as a standard weapon in its fleet,<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-girds-undersea-battle-south-china-sea-38452"> deploying</a> a new maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) that is optimized for ASW and<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/china-building-undersea-great-wall-take-america-war-90601"> developing</a> ocean bottom sensor networks in and around its key naval bases. Some coming attractions in this area will include a new<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/sinking-feeling-china-erodes-americas-submarine-advantage-27252"> generation</a> of Chinese ASW helicopters (both Z-18 and Z-20), as well as a system of unmanned undersea<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/america-may-soon-fight-itself-underwater-war-china-21650"> vehicles</a> (UUVs) that will perform various missions, including especially surveillance and laying sea-mines, at least at the outset.</p>
      <p>Now, a new threat to the dominance of the U.S. submarine force in the Western Pacific lies over the horizon. A series of recent articles published in China implies that the PLA Navy is hard at work on developing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that will take up the ASW mission. That could eventually pose a major problem for the undersea forces of the United States and also for the forces of its allies.</p>
