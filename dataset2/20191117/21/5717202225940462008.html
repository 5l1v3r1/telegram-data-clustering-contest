      <h1>Fans react to Leeds man Stuart Dallas’s Northern Ireland display</h1>

        <b>Leeds United fans will probably not be surprised to know that Stuart Dallas’s latest international performance has seen the wide-man receive a number of plaudits on social media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dallas has looked a different player for the Whites this season. He was outstanding during his run at right-back in Marcelo Bielsa’s side earlier in the campaign. And it is difficult to pick out any occasion where the 28-year-old has not impressed.</p>

      <p>And it appears that he has taken that form with him on international duty as he proved to be one of Northern Ireland’s standout performers as they drew 0-0 with the Netherlands at Windsor Park.</p>
      <p>The result was not good enough for Michael O’Neill’s side to keep their hopes of automatic-qualification for Euro 2020 alive. But they certainly showed why Ronald Koeman’s men as well as Germany have struggled to shake them off in this campaign.</p>

      <p>And Dallas’s display was one that was lauded by plenty of fans on Twitter after the game. For most players, it would be a remarkable achievement to play in four different positions in one game against a star-studded side like the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>However, it does not appear that many Leeds fans were taken aback to see Dallas play all over the pitch on Saturday. Bielsa has regularly called on the former Brentford man’s versatility during his time in Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Whites fans were amongst those to heap praise upon Dallas. But there were many others who suggested that the winger was excellent against the Dutch.</p>
      <p>Here is what some of the supporters were saying about Dallas’s display…</p>
