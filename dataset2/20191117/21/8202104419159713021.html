      <h3>The Saskatoon Farmers’ Market co-operative has voted in favour of relocating to a building in the city’s Airport Business Area.</h3>
      <p>The vote was held on Saturday, with more than two-thirds of the membership wanting to negotiate a 10-year lease on the Cavendish Building at 2612 Koyl Avenue, president of the co-operative’s board of directors, Adi Ramachandran, confirmed on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The co-operative has a bit more than 100 members and approximately 70 per cent of the membership voted, Ramachandran said.</p>
      <p>He said the board of directors will make the final decision to sign the lease on Thursday. If that vote passes, the co-operative will leave its current location at River Landing on Dec. 22.</p>
      <p>The farmers’ market co-operative has been in the city-owned building since 2007 and operates three days a week. However, city council wants a tenant that will operate six days a week.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Ramachandran clarified that the vote was not about moving, as that decision had already been made. He said the vote was about whether the new location would be an open-air street market or inside a building.</p>
      <p>“Because either way we were out of River Landing. Right from the beginning, we had maintained that our preferred option was to stay at River Landing, but the city took that option away.”</p>
      <p>The Koyl Avenue location <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-farmers-market-co-op-to-vote-in-a-week-on-building-near-airport">was chosen for its ample parking, proximity to Circle Drive and 15-minute commute</a> for most residents, Ramachandran said.</p>

      <p>The city <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-city-hall-seeks-tenant-for-farmers-market-building">has issued a formal request for proposals</a> for an entity to negotiate a five-year lease at the River Landing site.</p>
      <p>“The city seeks development of the site as a vibrant centre for the community and a destination location that provides dedicated farmers’ market days with verifiable Saskatchewan produce and content,” according to a 21-page document.</p>
      <p>Ramachandran previously told the StarPhoenix the co-operative has not completely closed the door on its current location, and could even operate a satellite market at the River Landing space. On Sunday, he expressed a desire to collaborate with the city at the co-operative’s new location “in ways that benefit” the community.</p>
      <p>“We want the citizens of Saskatoon to be happy,” he said.</p>
