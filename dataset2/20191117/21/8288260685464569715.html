      <h1>Dec's brutal swipe at Prince Andrew over BBC Newsnight interview on I'm A Celebrity</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:55:45+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly appeared to poke fun at the Duke of York's Newsnight interview as I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! 2019 kicked off.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Andrew attempted to defend his reputation following the Jeffrey Epstein sex scandal, and denied claims he had underage sex with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers.</p>
      <p>Giuffre has said she recalled the royal sweating as they danced at a club, but he said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.</p>
      <p>As I'm A Celebrity got under way on ITV on Sunday, McPartlin said this year's contestants were likely to be "sweating".</p>
      <p>But Donnelly quipped: "Presuming they can sweat, not everybody can apparently..."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Duke of York last night answered questions for the first time about his links to paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>He stuttered, stumbled and licked his lips as Newsnight host Emily Maitlis grilled him about allegations he'd had sex with Roberts, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein to be a sex slave</p>
      <p>He said he didn't meet her at the club because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking at the time.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity kicks off tonight with a host of famous faces heading to the jungle for three weeks of gruelling challenges.</p>
      <p>On the line-up is Olympian and reality star and transgender icon Caitlyn Jenner, former Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle, former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa, Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway, Radio presenter Roman Kemp, former  Big Brother  star Adele Roberts, comedian Andrew Maxwell, Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson, former rugby player James Haskell, and former footballer Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>There are also a few rumoured late additions.</p>
