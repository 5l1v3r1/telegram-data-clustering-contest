      <h1>Kanye West’s Next Project Is A Nebuchadnezzar Opera About The King Who Was Punished For His Arrogance</h1>

      <p>Now that Kanye West’s<i> Jesus Is King</i> album is a success, the rapper is working on his next project– an opera based on Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar was a Babylonian King who is also mentioned many times in the Old Testament and punished for his arrogance.</p>
      <p>West teased the opera on Twitter on Sunday with a gold engraving of the king. <i>Nebuchadnezzar </i>will be directed by Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft and will include music from West’s Sunday Service performers.</p>

      <p>West is known for his boasting, even telling Joel Osteen while visiting his Houston megachurch this weekend he had long had an “arrogance and cockiness” about his fame, but now believes that “God is now using it for Him.”</p>

      <p>Although his humility was short-lived when West stated, “Jesus has won the victory because now the greatest artist that God has ever created is working for Him.”</p>
      <p>The key lesson in Nebuchadnezzar’s part in the Bible is that he gets punished for his pride and vanity after the disciple Daniel warns him not to build his palace.</p>
      <p>“Look at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendour,” Nebuchadnezzar reportedly said according to Daniel.</p>
      <p>And like that God humbled him. “Even as the words were on his lips, a voice came from heaven, ‘This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you,'” the passage reads.  </p>
      <p>“[God] is saying, Let me take this Nebuchadnezzar-type character—Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon, and he looked at his entire kingdom and said, I did this,” West said to Zane Lowe during a recent Beats 1 interview.</p>
      <p>Then contradicting the entire lesson the story of Nebuchadnezzar teaches, said, “I stood on the top of the mountain talking about <i>Yeezus</i>, saying, ‘I’m a God’—I had a guy dressed as Jesus.”</p>
      <p>Perhaps West should read over the passage again before the opera debuts on Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the Hollywood Bowl show go on sale on Monday at noon.</p>
