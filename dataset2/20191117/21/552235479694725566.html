      <p>Noel Gallagher has revealed every tweet from his brother <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liam-gallagher">Liam</a> is a “nail in the coffin” of Oasis reunion hopes.</p>
      <p>The guitarist and songwriter said his younger sibling would put his life on hold to reunite the band.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/noel-gallagher">Noel</a> , 52, said he would not get back on stage with his “moron” brother.</p>
      <p>Liam, 47, became embroiled in a feud with his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> -born sister-in-law Sara MacDonald, 48, and was alleged to have sent threatening messages.</p>

      <p>Noel told The Big Issue: “It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it.</p>
      <p>He’d put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together. But every tweet he sends out its another nail in the coffin of that idea.”</p>
      <p>Addressing his brother directly, he added: “If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are f****** more of a moron than you look.”</p>
      <p>Noel conceded that his sibling was selling more records and more tickets than him and advised him to “ride it until the wheels come off”.</p>
