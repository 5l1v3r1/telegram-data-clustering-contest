      <h1>Female runners need better protection from disrespectful men during races, claims British athlete</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:00:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>Female marathon runners should be given better protection to stop men disrespecting them during races, a British athlete has claimed.</p>
      <p>Long-distance competitor<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/04/25/doesnt-matter-wobbles-britains-leading-female-runners-body/"> Lily Partridge</a>, from Surrey, revealed that she and other women were "violently pushed around" during a half marathon last month, causing some to suffer "heavy falls".</p>
      <p>Ms Partridge also said she was forced to confront a male runner who followed her "intimately close" while she was recently out on a trail path.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old shared her unpleasant experiences with her Instagram followers, calling for competitors to be more "respectful" and women to be given their own designated space on the start line.</p>
      <p>In a caption of a picture of her training, she wrote that she was "happily bumbling" along when she overtook the male runner 30-40 yards ahead of her.</p>
      <p>She said he then began following her at an unnerving distance.</p>
      <p>"I realised he was running really close and I mean close - intimately close. Not creepy, I wasn't scared or intimidated, happy to share the path, but a bit 'you ok mate?'," wrote Ms Partridge.</p>
      <p>"It seemed off and I felt I was being tracked so I moved across the path and he followed, so I did it again and again he followed me. This continued for a few minutes."</p>
      <p>She said she "tried to make it obvious" that she wasn't comfortable with his behaviour, but ended up confronting him.</p>
      <p>"I turned round and asked what the hell he was playing at," wrote Ms Partridge.</p>
      <p>Seemingly unaware of the stress he had caused her, the runner responded "good pace, good pace" as if she was his own "unofficial 5ft 3in windbreak".</p>
      <p>Reflecting on her other bad experience at aÂ half marathon, where she said she was jostled on the start line, she wrote: "All I ask is that male runners be an ally to women and let this sport be a safe and happy space for everyone.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy to spar with you in races/training, push each other to great performances and shake your hand at the finish, but this isn't ok. Please be respectful."</p>
      <p>She added: "I hope it is sorted next time and the elite women are given a designated space on the start line."</p>
      <p>Ms Partridge's observations chimed with her fellow runners, who rushed to show their support.</p>
      <p>One of her followers commented: "I was in the elite start of Leeds Abbey last month and the treatment by the males trying to get by for a start space was the worst I'd ever experienced. It really shocked and worried me."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Really weird people out there."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/app-says-can-get-couch-potato-run-half-marathon-eight-weeks/">Half marathons</a> are road-based races covering a distance of around 13 miles, which usually take a few hours to complete.</p>
