      <h1>Prince Andrew advisor 'facing questions over position' after car crash interview</h1>
      <h2>The private secretary to Prince Andrew, Amanda Thirsk, is under pressure after she reportedly pushed for the Duke of York to answer questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:46:54+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:46</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew's private secretary's job is said to be under threat after she reportedly pushed for him to take part in what proved to be a car crash interview.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night the Duke of York's interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis about his involvement with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was aired.</p>
      <p>The hour-long programme was filled with revelations and surprising explanations, including Prince Andrew's claim that he was in Pizza Express with his daughter on the day he was alleged to have slept with a teenager.</p>
      <p>As the interview served to do little else but reignite scrutiny on the Prince's involvement with the now-dead financier, it is unclear why Buckingham Palace gave it the greenlight.</p>
      <p>It is understood the Queen gave the go-ahead for the filming at the Palace, but did not see any clips prior to it being broadcast.</p>

        <figcaption>The PR strategy surrounding the Prince's decision to be interviewed is not clear</figcaption>

      <p>One person who is said to have played a key part in persuading the Duke to take part is his private secretary Amanda Thirsk.</p>
      <p>According to sources speaking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/17/meetings-rehearsals-and-approval-from-mum-newsnights-prince-andrew-coup?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">The Guardian</a>, the former banker has never wavered in her belief that the rumours of sexual impropriety swirling around Andrew were false.</p>
      <p>“The Duke has done nothing wrong … all he did was go and see his friend,” she reportedly said.</p>

      <p>Ms Thirsk believed the public would come onto the Prince's side if they saw him explain himself.</p>
      <p>With the public reaction to last night's broadcast suggesting this has not proved the case, questions are now being asked about Ms Thirsk.</p>
      <p>It is said that Prince Andrew initially refused to take part in the interview before his private secretary persuaded him, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/17/aides-clashed-fears-newsnight-interview-would-leave-prince-andrew/">The Telegraph reported.</a></p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Prior to the Prince sitting down with Ms Maitlis there was tension in his camp.</p>
      <p>Ms Thirsk clashed with Jason Stein, who was hired by Prince Andrew to mastermind his PR strategy and who objected to him doing the interview.</p>
      <p>The former special advisor to Conservative MP Amber Rudd left two weeks before the interview - having spent just four weeks in the job.</p>
      <p>Unless there is a huge change in public sentiment, it seems Mr Stein's PR instincts were closer to the mark on this occasion.</p>

      <p>The Duke's TV appearance yesterday has been branded a "car-crash", "disastrous" and "like watching a man in quicksand".</p>
      <p>Despite the clanging reviews the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50450207">BBC reports</a> that sources close to the royal claimed he wanted to address the issues head-on and had done so with "honesty and humility."</p>
      <p>He reportedly stands by his decision to do the interview.</p>
