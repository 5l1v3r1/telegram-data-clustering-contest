      <h1>Roy Keane slaughters 'sloppy' Man Utd target Declan Rice and questions his tactical discipline</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder played the full 90 minutes for England in their 4-0 win over Kosovo.</h2>

      <p>It's pretty clear <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Roy Keane</a> wasn't impressed with in-demand Declan Rice during Ireland training sessions.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend was assistant to Martin O'Neil and watched the 20-year-old at close quarters as he won three caps in friendly games.</p>
      <p>Rice later changed his allegiances and is now a big part of Gareth Southgate's England plans for the future.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has been linked with a Â£70m move to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ole-gunnar-solskjaer">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> 's side but Keane reckons he has major improvements to make before he can be labelled a top player.</p>
      <p>Speaking to ITV ahead of the game against Kosovo, Keane said: "Where he needs to improve, there are plenty of aspects when you think about it.</p>

      <p>"Over the last few months he has had a lot of praise, I worked with him when he was with the Ireland squad.</p>
      <p>"Where does he need to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play, I don't think is consistent enough, he doesn't stay with runners, he's sloppy in possession.</p>
      <p>"I can go on. He's one of those players, a couple of months ago everyone was enjoying him and loved him. He's one of those players that's now played his way out of the team because he's not been consistent for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> ."</p>
      <p>Rice went on to be outshone by his fellow central midfielder Harry Winks against Kosovo, with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> man scoring the side's opening goal and winning the Man of the Match award.</p>
