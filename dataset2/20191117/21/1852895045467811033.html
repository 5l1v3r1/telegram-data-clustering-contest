      <p>NeNe’s return to <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>, which she has been on for 11 of the 12 seasons it’s been on the air, is definitely sure to be entertaining. One of the most anticipated episodes of the new season is the one that will show the “explosive” fight between NeNe and co-star <b>Kenya Moore</b>, 48, during a trip to Greece. “I will say the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/11/wendy-williams-kenya-moore-feud-nene-leakes-diss-bully-rhoa/">drama in the relationship</a> between NeNe and Kenya is…goes a little deeper than what seems to be on the surface. Their confrontation, hands down, has got to be the most explosive of the season for sure,” co-star <b>Cynthia Bailey</b>, 52, EXCLUSIVELY told <b>HollywoodLife</b> in Oct. The <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/10/21/kenya-moore-fight-nene-leakes-friendship-marc-daly-feud-rhoa/">fight</a> started after Kenya found out that her estranged husband<b> Marc Daly</b>, had been in close contact with NeNe and her husband <b>Gregg</b>, during their marriage.</p>
