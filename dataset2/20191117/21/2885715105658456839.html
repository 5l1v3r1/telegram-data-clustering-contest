      <p>AAP legislators have been directed by the party to hold booth-level meetings over the next month to propagate the party’s narrative of “good governance”, as against the “mismanagement” during the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> and Congress years, in the run-up to next year’s Assembly polls.</p>
      <p>Senior leader and Delhi unit convenor Gopal Rai said the action will shift to the booth level in the fourth phase of the party’s poll campaign. The first three phases saw AAP leaders, including CM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a>, address gatherings of party workers at the district and constituency levels.</p>
      <p>Rai said the campaign will cover around 14,000 booths in the city. The MLAs will hold ‘jan samvads’ or public dialogues at every booth in their respective constituencies. “The jan samvad events will be led by the MLAs. In constituencies not represented by us or those which have fallen vacant, leaders who’ve been made in-charges of those seats will lead the charge. Every MLA or in-charge will hold at least four-five events on a daily basis,” Rai said.</p>
      <p>Rai said the dialogues will include comparative discussions on the AAP’s record of governing Delhi since 2015, as against the performance of the Congress and the BJP. The campaign, set to begin on November 17, will continue till December 24.</p>
