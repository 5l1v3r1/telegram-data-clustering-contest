      <h1>Barça B 3-3 Cornella: Carles Perez scores in thrilling draw</h1>
      <h2>Barcelona threw away a two-goal lead and needed a late penalty to salvage a point</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:38:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:38</time> by <a rel="author">German Bona</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona B needed a late penalty from Monchu to rescue a point against Cornella having earlier thrown away a 2-2 draw. Monchu's spot-kick earned Garcia Pimienta's side a 3-3 draw at the Johan Cruyff Stadium.</p>
      <p>Barça B were boosted by the presence of Carles Perez, who was making his first appearance of the season after spending the campaign with the first team until now. He had scored in the first team's friendly win at Cartagena in midweek and opened the scoring against Cornella after good work from Riqui Puig.</p>
      <p>Perez scored after 10 minutes and it was soon 2-0, with Perez again involved. His shot was saved by Ramón but Japanese international Hiroki Abe was on the spot to turn home the rebound and score his first goal for the club.</p>
      <p>But Cornella reacted well. Leo Ramirez scored a cracker to get them back into the game and Eloy Gila levelled things up before the break.</p>
      <p>The game looked set to end in a draw when Riqui Puig fired wide late on but the game opened up in the final minutes. Becerra headed Cornella into the lead from a corner with just three minutes remaining but Barça went up the other end to earn a draw in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Ramón brought down makeshift striker Araujo and Monchu showed nerves of steel to send the keeper the wrong way.</p>
