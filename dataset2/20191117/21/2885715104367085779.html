      <p>The Money spent by Opposition parties in buying aircraft for “personal use” of their leaders is more than adequate to fund the free rides scheme for women in buses in Delhi, Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> said Sunday.</p>
      <p>“The Opposition raised a hue and cry when we implemented the scheme. They ask for the money source… A few days ago, the CM of a state bought an aircraft worth Rs 190 crore for his personal use. Instead of a plane for myself, I’m spending the money to make travel free for my sisters,” said Kejriwal, at an event in Rohini.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Gujarat government bought a business jet worth Rs 191 crore for use by CM Rupani and other VIPs. A senior state government official had told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, “The government currently owns a Beechcraft Super King aircraft, which is about 20 years old… It had several breakdowns and was unsafe to fly; so it was decided to buy a new one.”</p>
      <p>Implementing the free rides scheme between October 29 and March 31 next year, will cost the Delhi government Rs 140 crore.</p>
      <p>Kejriwal also announced that resurfacing roads will be done after breaking up the existing layer of asphalt, to ensure cost cutting of up to 30%. In a tweet, he also slammed a BIS report — which termed Delhi’s water the worst among all metros and state capitals — as “politically motivated”.</p>
