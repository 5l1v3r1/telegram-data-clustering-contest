        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz Jr.</a> has retained his first-ever podium in Formula 1, the FIA have decided, as they opted not to take any further action after investigating the Spaniard using DRS under a yellow flag.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz was one of six cars under investigation for the matter, as all cars were using the boost down the back straight despite there being a yellow flag for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>' parked car by the side of the track.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, who started the race in last place because of an engine issue during qualifying, crossed the line in fourth place but was bumped up to third following Lewis Hamilton's five-second penalty.</p>

      <p>It's not the way Sainz would have wanted to score his first-ever podium, but they all count, and he'll be glad to be off the mark after 101 Grands Prix without a top three finish in what was McLaren's first podium since Australia 2014. Could we see more <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLarens</a> on the podium in the coming years?</p>
