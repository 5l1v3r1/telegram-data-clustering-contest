      <p>The Jets have played all four NFC East teams this season and the results of those games may have them wishing that they were playing in the other conference.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13058/sam-darnold">Sam Darnold</a> threw four touchdowns for the first time in his NFL career in a 34-17 win that comes a week after they beat the Giants 34-27 at MetLife Stadium. They’ve also beaten the Cowboys this season, so all three of their wins have come in interconference play.</p>
      <p>This win was never really in doubt as the Jets scored on their first possession of the day and then extended their lead to 13-0 before Washington kicked a field goal. They would run that lead all the way to 34-3 before Washington scored its first touchdown in 17 quarters with 10 minutes left to play in the game.</p>
      <p>That touchdown was the first that <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/13979/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a> has thrown in the NFL and they drove for another score after the two-minute warning. He threw an interception, was sacked six times — Jets safety <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/12210/jamal-adams">Jamal Adams</a> had three of them to give him five in the last two weeks — and 86 of his 214 passing yards came on two plays, but at least there was something to grow on at the end.</p>
      <p>Darnold threw a bad interception in the first half, but otherwise turned in as sharp a performance as we’ve seen over his first two seasons. He was 19-of-30 for 293 yards and consistently found tight end Ryan Griffin and wide receiver <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/10373/jamison-crowder">Jamison Crowder</a> to keep drives moving. Griffin had two touchdowns and a career-high 109 receiving yards while Crowder caught his third touchdown of the year.</p>
      <p>There are no NFC East teams left for the Jets to play, so they’ll move on to host the Raiders next Sunday. Washington will host the Lions in a bid for Haskins’s first win as a starter and the team’s second win of the year.</p>
