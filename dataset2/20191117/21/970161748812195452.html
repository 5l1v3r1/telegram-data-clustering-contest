      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> passionately defended her voguing routine after she was eliminated from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p>
      <p>Michelle and her partner Giovanni Pernice performed to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/madonna/">Madonna</a> classic Vogue in the special episode from Blackpool tower ballroom.</p>
      <p>After landing in the dance off, the reality TV star was sent home by the judges.</p>
      <p>In a message shared to Instagram after Sunday’s results show, she said that she was ‘proud’ to leave the show on their couple’s choice routine.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old explained: ‘We are SO proud of the dance we did, but for me, it wasn’t about judges scores. It was about shedding light on a group of people who deserve recognition and would otherwise not get it.</p>
      <p>‘I owe my life to the LGBTQIA+ community so as an ally, I try to bring attention to them, their love, their struggles, in any way that I am able to. In this instance it happened to be through dance and hear this: Voguing IS dancing.’</p>

      <p>The judges voted unanimously to save Saffron, with Craig Revel Horwood admitting that it was ‘really difficult’ to choose who send home.</p>
      <h3>Michelle Visage's statement in full</h3>
      <p>I’ve learned in this life you must take big risks in order to affect change. Gio and I chose our couple’s choice to Vogue to bring a part of the underground gay ballroom scene to a massive show like Strictly.</p>
      <p>We are SO proud of the dance we did, but for me, it wasn’t about judges scores. It was about shedding light on a group of people who deserve recognition and would otherwise not get it.</p>
      <p>I owe my life to the LGBTQIA+ community so as an ally, I try to bring attention to them, their love, their struggles, in any way that I am able to. In this instance it happened to be through dance and hear this: Voguing IS dancing.</p>
      <p>‘THANK YOU SO MUCH to EVERYONE for all the love you have shown me on this Strictly journey. Welcoming this 51-year-old mum into their lives through their telly weekly, voting for us, letting this American know she’s welcomed into the British Public has meant SO much to me.</p>
      <p>I am BEYOND grateful. Through this experience I have made great new friends and a partner in Giovanni who will be in my life forever. This experience has been one I’ll cherish FOREVER.</p>
      <p>I’ll end it with this: sometimes in life things matter more than winning and in this case, being an ally and bringing a part of queer culture to 14 million viewers on the BBC is just as good as lifting that glitterball.</p>
      <p>I am honoured and proud to go out on that dance. For the kids who disowned by their parents, for those who feel like they aren’t worthy or good enough, for those being bullied and harassed for who they are, for my daughters, I will fight for your rights FOREVER.</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to his celebrity partner, Giovanni <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancings-giovanni-pernice-admits-he-argued-with-michelle-visage-as-pair-crash-out-11172295/">admitted that they had clashed in the past</a> but he saw her as an ‘inspiration’.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘We laugh, we cry, we fight and we argue and we’ve done everything but I’ve loved every single second. I think you are inspirational.’</p>
      <p>Michelle added: ‘This whole experience has been amazing. At 51 years old and never danced in my life, I never thought I’d be able to do what I have done and to have such an incredible partner.<br/>‘To be here for my husband and my kids and the entire community, that’s why I did what I did. I am so honoured to be welcomed by my new friends here.’</p>
