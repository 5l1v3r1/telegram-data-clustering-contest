      <p>TOOREEN secured the Connaught intermediate hurling championship title for a second time following a magnificent and well deserved victory over Galway champions Kinvara in the final at  Athleague today.</p>
      <p>After Tooreen won their first ever Connaught title in 2017, many at the time felt the Mayo champions caught their then Galway champions, Ballinderreen, on the hop and that their win was a fluke.</p>
      <p>While coming up short in the final last year, Tooreen were determined to show their 2017 was no fluke by beating Kinvara.</p>
      <p>This they did duly and in some style too.</p>
      <p>Right from the off Tooreen took command where they raced into a five-point lead with just seven minutes.</p>
      <p>Although they were stunned by a Kinvara goal from Galway star Conor Whelan a minute later, they hit back and outpointed their opponents by seven points to three for the remainder of the half, which left them leading by 0-12 to 1-3 at the interval.</p>
      <p>On the resumption Kinvara came out with all guns blazing and by the 41<sup>st</sup> minute had drawn level after scoring an unanswered 1-3.</p>
      <p>However, Tooreen regrouped and upped the ante.</p>
      <p>A magnificent point from play by man of the match Shane Boland put them back in front by the 42<sup>nd</sup> minute. As things transpired it was a lead they were never to lose.</p>
      <p>For the remainder of the half Tooreen dominated in most areas of the field and went on to add eight more points to their tally before coming out the brilliant winners of a high class encounter.</p>
