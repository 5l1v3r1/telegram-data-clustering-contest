      <p>Following a public hearing scheduled Monday evening in the City of White Rock council chambers, councillors will hear annual reports from a number of its committees.</p>
      <p>Starting at 7 p.m., the city will host a public hearing on amendments to Bylaw 2000, also known as the short-term rental bylaw.</p>
      <p>The public is invited to present their comments on the bylaw amendments, which are designed to update the accessory vacation rental regulations in the city’s zoning bylaw.</p>
      <p>A new term ‘short-term rental’ or ‘accessory vacation rental’ would replace the current definition for ‘vacation rental.’</p>
      <p>According to the public hearing agenda, the proposed regulations will require that the owner of a short term rental name a responsible person whose contact information must be displayed at the rental and who must be available to respond to inquiries from the city or guests within a two-hour window. The new amendments would also require rental owners to display their business license number in advertisements.</p>
