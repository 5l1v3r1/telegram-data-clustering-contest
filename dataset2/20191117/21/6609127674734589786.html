      <p>The tongue-in-cheek promo also features tuxedo-clad Neil Lennon conducting a choir, Scott Brown as a director and the team performing iconic carol We Three Kings.</p>
      <p>Manager Lenny also calls action with a clapperboard while right-back Moritz Bauer dresses as an elf.</p>

      <p>An insider said: “Neil really got into the spirit of it all and was waving his arms around like the great conductor Andre Previn.</p>
      <p>“He looked like he was enjoying himself. There was a lot of laughter during the filming because all the players got into the swing of things too.”</p>
      <p>Bosses hope the vid will raise a huge sum for charity.</p>
      <p>The source added: “The club is known for its festive video and everyone appeared happy to be donning anything from elves’ outfits to Christmas jumpers and reindeer ears to play their parts.</p>

      <p>“A couple of players are in angel wings and one is a big golden star.</p>
      <p>"The feeling is this song and film have the potential to go viral.”</p>
      <p>Hoops-daft songwriter John McLaughlin penned the new version of the Christmas classic.</p>
      <p>Rejigged lyrics focus on players and hails the Lisbon Lions.</p>
      <p>European Cup winner Bertie Auld, 81, was drafted in for a cameo.</p>
      <p>The recording took place in secret over a day at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow city centre last week.</p>
      <p>It will be launched at the end of the month.</p>
