      <h1>The Sisters/Garvoc bushfire Supreme Court case to start Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:23:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Thomson</a></address>
      <p>Electricity company Powercor knew about a rotten power pole in 2005, 13 years before it snapped and caused St Patricks Day fire bushfire in south west Victoria, according to lawyers acting for its victims.</p>
      <p>That claim that the company should have known and didn't act will be key in a Supreme Court civil trial starting on Monday in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>It's part of the official written outline of opening submitted to the court by Hall &amp; Wilcox, lawyers for bushfire victims and their insurers, which has been obtained by <i>ACM, </i>the owner of this newspaper.</p>
      <p>The opening contains the evidence victims of 2018 bushfire will rely on in their more than $19 million case against the electricity giant and an inspection contractor.</p>
      <p>Experts will tell the court that Powercor was on notice from 2005 that the pole had a substantial internal cavity caused by rot, but failed to take any additional precautions in the subsequent 13 years leading up to its failure.</p>
      <p>A drill test in 2005 returned a reading of just 70mm of sound wood.</p>
      <p>A Powercor spokeswoman said the company would not be commenting while the matter was before the court.</p>
      <p>The case is expected to be extremely topical as Victoria approaches a bumper fire danger period, and bushfires continue to devastate much of New South Wales and Queensland.</p>
      <p>On St Patrick's Day last year, pole No. 4 on the Sparrow Spur line near Terang snapped in high wind causing a bushfire. It was one of four main bushfires caused that day in the south-west by electrical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>According to the claim, the collapse was due to wood rot and termites producing a conical or vase-shaped void about two metres high inside the pole.</p>
      <p>At the time of the fire, the mountain grey gum pole had been in service for 53 years in the high bushfire danger area.</p>
      <p>It was double staked in 1994, shifting the load point from ground level to above the stakes.</p>
      <p>But, expert evidence suggests these works reduced the strength of the pole by 25 to 30 per cent and allowed increased moisture to enter the pole through large bolt holes - producing a more conducive environment for timber rot and decay.</p>
      <blockquote>In other words, a measure designed to strengthen the pole and prolong its service life ultimately had the opposite effect.<cite>Hall &amp; Wilcox claim.</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Expert evidence will be heard that data collected on inspections was not actioned, leaving enormous gaps in Powercor's knowledge of its ageing fleet of 580,000 power poles.</p>
      <p>Subsequent inspectors were kept in the dark about the fact that the pole had been impacted by rot for over a decade, the court will be told. Inspections were also undertaken when inspectors were under pressure to meet targets during an impending tender/contract renewal process and some checks were completed in under four minutes, it will also be claimed.</p>
      <p>Experts will say even visual inspections should have set off alarm bells in 2005 about pole No. 4 and defects would have been visible at all four subsequent inspections. The last inspection was carried out on November 30, 2017 - just four months before the bushfire.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs will claim the inspection in 2005, and every one since, were performed incompetently.</p>
      <p>They say the drilling tests identified "well established decay" and had the inspections been properly performed, the pole would have been identified and removed from service years before the fire.</p>
      <p>A series of fires in the Terang district on St Patrick's Day led to the loss of 18 homes, 45 sheds and thousands of stock.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs in The Sisters/Garvoc fire, many dairy farmers, sustained damaged of about $19.1 million and have had ongoing business losses in addition to the massive psychological toll on the victims and their community.</p>
      <p>A class action run by Warrnambool's Maddens Lawyers in relation to the same fire was recently settled.</p>
      <p>Other legal actions in relation to fires at Terang/Cobden, Camperdown/Gnotuk and Gazette bushfires in the south-west are also in the process of or have been settled.</p>
