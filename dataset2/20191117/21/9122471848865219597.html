      <h1>Photos: Lamar Jackson, Deshaun Watson Share Heartfelt Moment After Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:58:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson are two of the NFL’s brightest young stars at the quarterback position, and both have been mentioned in the MVP conversation this season.</p>
      <p>Jackson and Watson faced off this afternoon when the Texans traveled to Baltimore to play the Ravens. Jackson and his teammates dominated the matchup, winning 41-7.</p>
      <p>The second-year Baltimore quarterback threw for four touchdowns and compiled over 300 yards of total offense. Meanwhile, Watson struggled, turning the ball over twice and throwing for only 169 yards.</p>
      <p>After the game, the two longtime competitors–they faced off multiple times in college–had a heartfelt moment at midfield.</p>
      <p>The pair exchanged jerseys and posed for a couple of photos.</p>

      <p>Watson is in his third season, with Jackson in his second. The two look like they will headline the NFL’s next generation of star quarterbacks, along with Patrick Mahomes.</p>
      <p>If they played against each other again in the playoffs, we wouldn’t complain.</p>
