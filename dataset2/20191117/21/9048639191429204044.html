      <p><b>MONROE, La. (KNOE) - </b>Monroe Medical Center took emergency precautions diverting people from entering the emergency room Sunday.</p>
      <p>Officials say the hospital initiated its Ebola protocol after receiving a patient with flu-like symptoms. The patient reported a history of traveling to Africa.</p>
      <p>The hospital notified the Louisiana Office of Public Health. After investigating further, they determined the patient visited areas not affected by the virus and ruled out the risk.</p>
      <p>Tina Martinez, Regional Director of Communications for Ochsner Health System, said, "We commend our team for swiftly initiating our Ebola protocol, which includes screening and isolation of any patient suspected of having the disease."</p>
      <p>Martinez said she wants to be clear Monroe Medical Center does not have any suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola.</p>
