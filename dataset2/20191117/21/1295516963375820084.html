      <h1>AEW's Jon Moxley Blasts WWE For Creative Incompetence</h1>

      <p>Professional wrestler Jon Moxley (real name Jonathan Good) -- who is currently signed to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/aew/">All Elite Wrestling</a> -- has certainly not been shy about explaining why exactly he decided to part ways with <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/wwe/">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Moxley -- who wrestled for WWE from 2011 to 2019 under the name Dean Ambrose -- has detailed the creative frustrations that led to his departure from the Connecticut-based promotion on multiple occasions, lambasting directions in which his character was taken in. Moxley has now offered yet another rant, explaining that while he was more than happy to leave the promotion behind, it was hard not to get hung up on the amount of money he was leaving on the table as well.</p>

      <p>"The whole time from when I came back to about the beginning of the year, I knew I was leaving," Moxley said while speaking on a panel at Starrcast IV. "But I was pissed about it. I wasn't excited to leave, I was bitter about it. I can't believe that they're going to make me leave. I can't believe they're going to make me walk away from all this money.</p>
      <p>"Can [WWE] not write just one good storyline?" he continued. "Can they just give me one good promo? Does everything have to be fucking stupid? Does everything have to make me look like an idiot? For fuck's sake, you're going to make me walk away from all this fucking money because it's not like I wanted that money. Yeah, I want it, but I'm not doing that shit. So I was pissed. I can't believe they were so incompetent that they're going to make me walk away from all this money. Jesus Christ, now I have to go back to the indies, fuck it, let's go."</p>

      <p>Moxley made his pro wrestling debut in 2004, wrestling for various independent promotions before signing a developmental deal with WWE in 2011. In 2012, Moxley -- then Dean Ambrose -- made his main roster debut as a member of The Shield alongside Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns. He wrestled for WWE for several years, racking up multiple championships and accolades along the way. However, fans often criticized WWE creative's handling of the Dean Ambrose character -- with the man himself evidently sharing the sentiment.</p>
      <p>Not long after his WWE contract expired this past April, Moxley made his AEW debut in the form of a surprise appearance at the <i>Double or Nothing</i> pay-per-view event in May, before wrestling his first match for the promotion at June's<i> Fyter Fest</i>. Moxley has gone on to appear on <i>Dynamite</i> -- AEW's weekly show -- and recently came out on top during a <a href="https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/video-moxley-and-omega-pull-out-everything-in-lights-out-match/">controversial match</a> against Kenny Omega at the Full Gear PPV. In addition to AEW, Moxley has wrestled elsewhere since leaving WWE, most notably New Japan Pro Wrestling -- where he held the IWGP United States Championship for a time. He has also made appearances for various indie promotions.</p>
