      <p>Three men have been arrested after a woman was raped in a park in Greater Manchester in what police have described as a 'despicable attack'.</p>
      <p>The woman, believed to be in her 30s, was subjected to the horrifying attack in a park in Wigan on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>She told police one man attacked her, while another two men stood by and watched.</p>
      <p>She had been walking alone at around 9.20pm when she began talking to three men, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/three-men-arrested-after-woman-17271223">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>The four of them walked to nearby Mesnes Park, where the woman was raped.</p>
      <p>A passer-by called police and officers attended a short time later, and arrested three men aged 33, 25, and 24 on suspicion of rape.<br/> </p>
