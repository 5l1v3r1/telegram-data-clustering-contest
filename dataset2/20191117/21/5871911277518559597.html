      <p>Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott may never live down the bizarre pregame warmup routine that he went through before Sunday’s game against the Vikings.</p>
      <p>The hip thrusts were mocked all over social media, with memes sprouting up all over the place.</p>
      <p>Prescott’s teammate Ezekiel Elliott must have seen them as well, judging by what the Cowboys running back did during Sunday’s game.</p>
      <p>Elliott rumbled into the end zone in the fourth quarter of the game, giving his team a two-score lead, and he celebrated by doing his version of Prescott’s hip thrust.</p>
