      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:52:00+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dhns" target="_blank">DHNS</a></address>
      <p>Wild elephants have been destroying crops in Kodlipete hobli, Kattepura, Agali, Niluvagilu and surrounding areas in Shanivarasanthe for the last one week. </p>
      <p>Fear has gripped the residents with the presence of elephants in the village.</p>
      <p>A herd of 16 elephants and a tusker have been moving around coffee estates and villages freely. The elephants have arrived from Umbuli Betta in Hemavathi backwaters to Kattepura forest, said RFO K Kotresh. </p>
      <p>The Forest Department officials and villagers have been trying to chase the elephants for the last one week, but all their efforts have been in vain. </p>
      <p>The elephants have destroyed even the solar fence. </p>
      <p>RFO Kotresh said, “The elephants are camping at Kattepura forest and are on the rampage. Efforts will be made to chase the elephants from Kattepura forest.” </p>
