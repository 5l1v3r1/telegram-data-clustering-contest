      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:52:47+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat on Sunday presided over a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) event in Gandhinagar on the occasion of the 100th birth anniversary of Dattopant Thengadi, founder of many sister organisations of the RSS.</p>
      <p>Terming Thengadi as a mahapurush (great person) Devvrat said, “I got to work with Thengadi many times as I was the president of BKS in Haryana for 10 years when he used to guide us farmers. Thengadi was not an ordinary man but a great human being (mahapurush). Ordinary people will follow the path, which is already laid out for them by their ancestors, whereas great persons carve out a new path with their virtues and make others follow it as well. Using the same virtues, Thengadi not only founded four organisations but also ensured that he kept nurturing and guiding them all his life. He had an incredible personality, was an excellent writer and a superb organisation manager.”</p>
      <p>Dattopant Thengadi, born in Wardha, Maharashtra, was a Hindu thinker and trade unionist who founded Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), Mazdoor Kisan Sangh (MKS), Swadeshi Jagran Manch and co-founded the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad — all sister organisations of the RSS. The event was organised by BKS, MKS, SJM and ABVP and Gujarat Governor was invited to “preside” over the event.</p>
      <p>Drawing an analogy to Thengadi’s life, the Governor said, “Once Sun was in despair because it was about to set, after illuminating the whole day, showing light to the people on earth. It was then that the Moon stepped forward, told the Sun that it is his job now to take Sun’s place and show light to the people during night time. Similarly, the soul of Thengadi must be content like the sun, after seeing the work carried out by the BKS, MKS, ABVP and SJM in his absence.”</p>
      <p>Jayanti Bhadesia, sanghchalak, western Zone of RSS, said, “Out of the 75 years he lived, Thengadi dedicated 60 years working for the RSS. Through his leadership skills and magnetic persona, he turned the Hindutva ideology as the base of the four organisations to make their mark globally. It was often said that Thengadi worked 13 months a year and 25 hours a day.”</p>
