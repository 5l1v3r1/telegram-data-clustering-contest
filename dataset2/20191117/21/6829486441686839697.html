      <h1>“Medieval Fool”: Israel Folau Slammed For Linking Bushfires To Marriage Equality</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:29:05+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Former rugby player Israel Folau has again incited the ire of the nation by suggesting that the devastating bushfires sweeping across NSW and Queensland are a result of the passing of the gay marriage bill.</p>
      <p>Folau, best known for his repeated slurs on the LGBTIQ community, was sacked this year from Rugby Australia for homophobic posts on his Instagram page. He has since attempted to fight the decision in court and is <a href="https://junkee.com/israel-folau-gofundme/210581">begging his supporters for their financial scraps.</a></p>

      <p>But that doesn’t appear to have humbled the rugby star — humility: a Christian virtue — who has this week posted a video to the Truth of Jesus Christ Church Sydney outlining his most discriminatory views.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been looking around at the events that’s been happening in Australia, this past couple of weeks, with all the natural disasters, the bushfires and the droughts,” he says in the video, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/fiery-reaction-after-israel-folau-links-australian-bushfires-to-same-sex-marriage/news-story/35d07139e6ba4b69fae67a3388071a97">as per <i>News.com.au</i>.</a></p>
      <p>“The events that have happened here in Australia, in the last couple of years — God’s word says for a man and a woman to be together. They’ve come and changed this law. Abortion, it’s OK now to murder, kill infants, unborn children.</p>
      <p>“Look how rapid these bushfires these droughts, all these things have come in a short period of time. Do you think it’s a coincidence or not?”</p>
      <p>Since the video reached the public eye, Folau has been slammed from all corners, with the story even reaching the attention of international outlets.</p>

      <p>Even Folau’s staunch defender, controversial broadcaster Alan Jones, thinks the rugby star has gone too far.</p>
      <p>“Israel is a lovely human being, I know him well. Israel, button up. Button up,” Jones said on his show this week. “These comments don’t help.”</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that Folau’s comments are not only widely offensive to the LGBTIQ community, but also to all those who have been affected by the bushfires. With one brief bit of hate-filled invective, Folau has managed to further besmirch his name in the light of both the nation and the world.</p>
      <p>Let’s see him start a GoFundMe to get out of this one.</p>
