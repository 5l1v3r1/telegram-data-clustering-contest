      <p>Ant McPartlin made a joke about his break from I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! as he returned for the new series of the show.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter took a step back from his work commitments following his arrest for drink-driving in March 2018, and This Morning host Willoughby stepped in to join Declan Donnelly in the jungle for I’m A Celebrity in 2018.</p>
      <p>McPartlin is back for this year’s series of the ITV show, and as it got under way on Sunday night, Donnelly shouted: “He’s back! I’m back! We are all back!”</p>

      <p>The duo then started to discuss this year’s hopefuls and as Donnelly got confused about which contestant they were talking about, McPartlin quipped: “I’ve had a year off, what’s your excuse?”</p>
      <p>Ten new contestants including US reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, Match Of The Day presenter and former Arsenal favourite Ian Wright, Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson, former Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts from Big Brother are starring in the new series of the show.</p>
