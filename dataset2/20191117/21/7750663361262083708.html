      <p>The 20-year-old, who could make his international debut in his team's final <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a> qualification match, has scored nine times and registered 10 assists in 23 appearances for AZ this season.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Mundo Deportivo</i>, Stengs's form this term has attracted the attention of the Spanish champions, who will have officials in attendance on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The fact that Holland have already qualified for next summer's tournament could see <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ronald-koeman/"><b>Ronald Koeman</b></a> rotate his side, although it remains to be seen whether Stengs is given his first taste of international football.</p>
      <p>The versatile attacker came through the youth system at AZ, making his debut during the 2016-17 campaign and since becoming a regular for the Dutch club.</p>
      <p>The youngster has managed two goals and two assists in four Europa League group appearances this term, although he could not find a route past Manchester United goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-de-gea/"><b>David de Gea</b></a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/europa-league/result/result-az-man-united-play-out-uneventful-goalless-draw_373842.html">last month</a>.</p>
