      <h3>Gautam Gambhir misses pollution meet </h3>
      <p>The Parliamentary Standing Committee of Urban Development was postponed in Delhi on Saturday as the MCD, Vice-Chairman of DDA, Secretary/Joint Secretary of Environment also did not attend it. Reportedly, 25 out of 29 members did not attend the meeting even as air quality deteriorated in the national capital of Delhi. BJP MP Gautam Gambhir especially drew a lot of flak for escaping the pollution meet and attending Test match in Indore. This has resulted in a lot of memes surfacing on social media and on Sunday missing posters have also propped up around the ITO area in Delhi. The poster reads, "Have you seen him (Gambhir)? He was last seen eating jalebi in Indore. All of Delhi is searching for him”.  </p>
