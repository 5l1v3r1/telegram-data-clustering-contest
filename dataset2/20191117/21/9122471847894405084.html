      <h1>ESPN’s Updated Prediction For Ohio State-Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:52:16+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>There are now less than two weeks until the 2019 edition of “The Game” between Ohio State and Michigan. The Buckeyes and the Wolverines will meet in Ann Arbor on Saturday, Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>Ryan Day’s team has been the better squad all season long – they’re 10-0 and ranked No. 2 in the nation, after all – but Jim Harbaugh has the Wolverines rolling as of late.</p>
      <p>Michigan blew out Michigan State on Saturday and is finally humming on offense. Will the Wolverines be able to pull off an upset and give Harbaugh his first victory over Ohio State?</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has updated its prediction.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index still likes the Buckeyes, though the percentages are starting to get a little closer. It gives Ohio State a 77.8 percent chance to win, giving Michigan a 22.2 percent chance.</h3>
      <p>Michigan QB Shea Patterson is ready for the matchup.</p>
