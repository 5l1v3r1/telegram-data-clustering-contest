      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas crowned an incredible year as he battled back to beat Austrian Dominic Thiem 6-7(6) 6-2 7-6(4) to win the ATP Finals title at the O2 Arena on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old debutant, the youngest of the eight qualifiers for the elite season-ender, displayed resilience and flair in equal measure to claim his biggest title to date, and become the youngest winner of the tournament since Lleyton Hewitt, aged 20, won it in 2001.</p>
      <p>Thiem edged an intense first set full of powerful baseline rallies but Tsitsipas, the first Greek player to play in the event, was undaunted and responded in style.</p>

      <p>He surged into a 4-0 lead in the second set and Thiem appeared to be flagging when he then trailed 3-1 in the deciding set before rediscovering his early spark.</p>
      <p>Thiem broke back to take the showpiece into a deciding tiebreak but it was Tsitsipas, the crowd favourite, who stayed strong, moving 6-4 ahead and clinching victory when Thiem fired a tired forehand wide.</p>
      <p>‘‘I was playing with nerves, it’s such a big event,’’ Tsitsipas said.</p>
      <p>‘‘I was a break up in the third set but couldn’t hold it, but I’m so relieved with this outstanding performance I gave on the court.’’</p>

      <p>Tsitsipas, who was congratulated by his country’s prime minister after his semi- final win over Roger Federer, praised the legions of Greek fans who made the 02 in London feel like a home away from home for the new champion.</p>

      <p>‘‘It’s phenomenal, unbelievable to have such an army behind me, they give me energy, and belief, and I just love that,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘‘I would like to thank everyone who supported me with a Greek flags and made me feel at home.’’</p>
      <p>World No.5 Thiem beat both six-time champion Roger Federer and five-time winner Novak Djokovic in the group stage but lost another big final after twice finishing runner-up to Rafael Nadal at the French Open.</p>
      <p>It is the fourth year in a row that there is a first-time champion at the season-ending event, after wins by Andy Murray in 2016, Gregor Dimitrov in 2017 and Alexander Zverev last year.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, French duo Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert won the doubles title by beating Raven Klaasen of South Africa and Michael Venus of New Zealand 6-3 6-4.</p>
