      <p>Ant McPartlin made a joke about his break from I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! as he returned for the new series of the show.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter took a step back from his work commitments following his arrest for drink-driving in March 2018, and This Morning host Willoughby stepped in to join Declan Donnelly in the jungle for I'm A Celebrity in 2018.</p>
      <p>McPartlin is back for this year's series of the ITV show, and as it got under way on Sunday night, Donnelly shouted: "He's back! I'm back! We are all back!"</p>
      <p>The duo then started to discuss this year's hopefuls and as Donnelly got confused about which contestant they were talking about, McPartlin quipped: "I've had a year off, what's your excuse?"</p>
      <p>Ten new contestants including US reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, Match Of The Day presenter and former Arsenal favourite Ian Wright, Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson, former Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts from Big Brother are starring in the new series of the show.</p>
      <p>Comedian Andrew Maxwell, actress Jacqueline Jossa, DJ Roman Kemp, rugby star James Haskell and Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway will also spend up to three weeks taking on the harsh surroundings of the Australian bush.</p>
