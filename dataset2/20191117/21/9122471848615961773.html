      <p>The Michigan football sideline was a fun place to be on Saturday afternoon. The Wolverines were shellacking their rival, Michigan State, after all.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t fun for <i>everyone</i>, though.</p>
      <p>One Michigan student manager appears to be terrified of head coach Jim Harbaugh.</p>
      <p>Video of this manager’s reaction to seeing Harbaugh strutting down the sideline is going viral:</p>

      <p>Hey, I’d be terrified of Jim Harbaugh if I was a student manager, too. He’s one of the most-intense figures in all of sports.</p>
      <p>There were likely smiles all around in the locker room following the game, at least.</p>
      <p>Michigan topped Michigan State, 44-10, to improve to 8-2 on the season.</p>
