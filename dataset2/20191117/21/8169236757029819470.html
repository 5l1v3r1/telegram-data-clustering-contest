        <b>Paul Pogba has given Man United a bit of hope regarding his fitness levels, after the Red Devils midfielder posted a video of himself working in the gym as he works his way back from injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pogba has been out for some time after picking up an injury against Leicester back in September, with the Frenchman playing just once for the club since then.</p>

      <p>Although now, it seems like the French international is nearing a return from injury after he posted a video of himself working in the gym in the US.</p>
