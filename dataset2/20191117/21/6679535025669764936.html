      <p>The gates of ‘chardham’, a set of four pilgrimage sites in Garhwal Himalayas, including Badrinath are closed every year in October-November for devotees due to extreme cold conditions.</p>
      <p>They are thrown open to devotees in April-May with the onset of summer.</p>
      <p>With the portals of the other three Himalayan temples — Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri already closed, the closure of Badrinath marks the end of the annual ‘chardham’ yatra or pilgrimage season.</p>
