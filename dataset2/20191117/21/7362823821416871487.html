      <h1>Democrats' smear campaign against Trump sparked White House involvement in Ukraine, Devin Nunes says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T21:40:40+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Givas</a></address>
      <p>The Trump <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">White House</a> became involved in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukrainian</a> affairs to investigate a smear campaign from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats">Democrats</a> against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">president</a>, but the fact-finding mission was twisted and used as an excuse for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a>, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a>, R-Calif., said in an interview airing Sunday.</p>
      <p>Nunes appeared on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/life-liberty-levin">Life, Liberty &amp; Levin</a>" to discuss the House's impeachment inquiry into Trump, and said Democrats paid <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/fusion-gps">Fusion GPS</a> to dig up dirt on the president through Ukrainian sources, helping spawn the probe from former Special Counsel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation">Robert Mueller</a>.</p>
      <p>The California Republican also said it was perfectly reasonable for the president and his surrogates to go looking for answers after they faced attacked from all sides.</p>
      <p>"What's just amazing is, the Democrats continue to say, 'oh, this is some kind of conspiracy theory'... The fact that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/robert-de-niro-rudy-giuliani-criminal-family-lost-his-mind">Rudy Giuliani</a> would be in Ukraine or talking to Ukrainians about, 'hey, where's this dirt that's being dug up on my client?' It would be a dereliction of Rudy Giuliani's responsibilities as the personal attorney to the president [not to do so]," Nunes said.</p>

      <p>Nunes also accused Democrats of targeting high-ranking Ukrainian officials to provide damaging information about the president so they could use it to force him out of office.</p>

      <p>"You had so many problems in Ukraine," Nunes said earlier in the segment. "The Democrats, they hate to admit this, but their sources for the Fusion GPS [dossier] -- a company that they were paying to dig up the dirt on Trump that ultimately made its way into the FBI -- there were Ukrainian sources there, so they were paying people to go into Ukraine and dig up dirt."</p>
      <p>"Some of this dirt came from high-ranking Ukrainian officials, allegedly," he added. "Remember, we spent three years with this Mueller nonsense. [Giuliani] had every right and responsibility to be over there."</p>
