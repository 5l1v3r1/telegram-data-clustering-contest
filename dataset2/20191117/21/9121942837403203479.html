      <p>BEIJING (AP) — China says a 55-year-old man has been diagnosed with bubonic plague after killing and eating a wild rabbit, adding to two plague cases already discovered in the capital Beijing.</p>
      <p>A statement from the health authority in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region north of Beijing said as of Saturday the man was being treated at a hospital in the city of Huade.</p>
      <p>It said investigators found the patient from rural Xilingol League consumed the rabbit on Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>The statement said 28 people who had close contact with the man were quarantined but none has run a fever or shown other plague symptoms.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 12, two patients also from Xilingol League were diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing. No epidemiological association has been found between the two cases.</p>
