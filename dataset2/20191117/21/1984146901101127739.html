      <p>Ant &amp; Dec made a vicious dig at Prince Andrew's expense within seconds of I'm A Celebrity returning on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>On the same day that the hit ITV show returned, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/prince-andrew-denies-having-sex-17269827">Prince Andrew made headlines with his much talked about Newsnight interview.</a></p>
      <p>In the televised chat with Emily Maitliss, the Duke of York denied having sex with Virginia Roberts, the teenager at the centre of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal – saying he is in the clear because he 'can’t sweat'.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberts claims the Prince was “sweating profusely” as he danced in a nightclub – and that they had sex that night and on two further occasions.</p>
      <p>But during a 50-minute BBC interview Prince Andrew said he can not even remember meeting her and, with regards to the sweating claim, he added "There’s a slight problem with the sweating because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t at the time."</p>
      <p>Using this as ammunition for their gag on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> , <i><b>which you can watch in the video from ITV above</b> </i>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> "Ten celebrities all of them nervous...all of them sweaty...presuming they can sweat!"</p>
      <p>The Geordie duo went onto crack a similar joke just minutes later.</p>
