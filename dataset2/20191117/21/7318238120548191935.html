      <p>Czechs celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution on Sunday (November 17), flocking to central Prague for concerts and speeches to mark the end of communist rule.</p>
      <p>The festivities took place one day after a quarter of a million Czechs rallied against Prime Minister Andrej Babis and President Milos Zeman over concerns that the pair are chipping away at democracy in the nation 10.7 million people.</p>
      <p>The two political leaders kept a low profile during the events, though Babis paid an early-morning visit to a memorial where police beat up student protesters in 1989 - a crackdown that sparked the wider rallies against the totalitarian regime.</p>
      <p>The events on Sunday offered Czechs more of a party, with the unseasonably warm weather bringing out families and offering others a chance to sip beers while listening to the concerts and speeches.</p>
