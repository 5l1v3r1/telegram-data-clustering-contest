      <p>Turns out Mariah Carey’s son Moroccan (or “Rocky,” as she affectionately calls him) is a big Deadpool fan. Luckily for him, his mom is Mariah Carey and she has connections. Carey posted a photo to Instagram showing her two children, including Moroccan in a Deadpool mask, alongside Blake Lively and Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds.</p>

      <p>“Rocky snuck up on an unsuspecting couple wearing a Deadpool mask,” she wrote on Instagram. “Will they ever recover?”</p>
      <p>Carey recently opened up <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28137694/mariah-carey-profile-cover-cosmo-interview-sex-shade-memes/">to </a><i><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28137694/mariah-carey-profile-cover-cosmo-interview-sex-shade-memes/">Cosmopolitan</a></i> about raising her children, saying that she wants them to have the childhood she didn’t, specifically when it comes to Christmas.</p>
      <p>“As a kid, I always hoped for great Christmases, and we didn’t have them. My brother and sister would come back to wherever I was with my mom, and they’d be fighting and ruining the holiday. I would still be like, You know what? I just want to have the best time,” she said. “We do everything that I always wanted to do as a kid.”</p>
      <p>She also recently shut down the idea that she would reunite with her ex-husband and the father of her two children, Nick Cannon, after he said he would go back and marry Carey all over again.</p>
      <p>“Remarry? This is him making this up. He’s being silly,” <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29448810/nick-cannon-mariah-carey-response-remarriage/">she told</a> a TMZ cameraman, who then asked her if she liked the liked the single life. “What is he, my last hope?”</p>
      <p>Queen of Christmas. Queen of comebacks. Queen of motherhood.</p>
