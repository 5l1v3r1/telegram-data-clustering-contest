      <p>A new paid membership service is coming to Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp.</p>
      <p>The paid membership service will arrive on the nearly two-year-old game on Novermber 21, it was revealed in an in-game news update spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-is-introducing-a-paid-membership-service.153558/#post-26540038">ResetEra</a> user ZeoVGM.</p>
      <p>The membership service comes in two different plans. One will let you appoint an animal as your camp caretaker to get extra help around camp. The other lets you receive fortune cookies and store your furniture and clothes in warehouses.</p>
      <p>Full details on the new Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp membership service is slated to arrive later this month.</p>
      <p>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is available on the app stores for both Android and Apple’s iOS. The game is free-to-play, but you can spend money on Leaf Tickets to speed up some of the wait times on building and crafting.</p>
