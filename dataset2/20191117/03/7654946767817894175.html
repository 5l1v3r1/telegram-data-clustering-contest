      <h1>Familiar flaw does in Rangers despite improved effort</h1>

      <p>SUNRISE, Fla. — Better, but hardly complete.</p>
      <p>The Rangers had quite an improvement from one of their worst games in recent memory, but were undercut by their struggling penalty kill and lost, 4-3, to the Panthers at BB&amp;T Center on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The Rangers (8-8-2) were coming off a historically bad loss, a 9-3 defeat at Tampa Bay on Thursday night. It was hard to be equally bad, so they were certainly better in this one. But it did look a lot like the most recent time these two teams met, just this past Sunday at the Garden, when the Panthers (10-5-5) ended up taking a 6-5 win in the shootout — a game that Rangers coach David Quinn said resembled “a shootout at the O.K. Corral.”</p>
      <p>While that was the case for most of this game yet again, Quinn and his team went into the third period down, 4-3. Goalie Henrik Lundqvist, tying Grant Fuhr for 10th on the all-time list of appearances with 868, kept his team in it late in the third. He made a big stop on Jonathan Huberdeau with just under five minutes remaining in regulation.</p>
      <p>The Blueshirts then got a golden chance to tie it when the Panthers were called for too many men on the ice with 4:30 remaining. But they weren’t able to beat goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, not then, and not into the frantic final moments when Lundqvist was on the bench for the extra attacker.</p>
      <p>So it ended, with nothing to show for this two-game swing through Florida.</p>
      <p>Early on, it was the Rangers penalty kill that continued to, well, kill them. After allowing five goals on the man-advantage to the Lightning, they allowed the Panthers to score on each of their first two chances. The first came from Mike Hoffman at 2:05 of the first period — matched just 34 seconds later when Ryan Strome finished a backdoor tap-in on a great pass from Jesper Fast at full strength — and the second came at 6:50, when Evgenii Dadonov, open in the slot, scored to make it 2-1.</p>
      <p>The Rangers didn’t wait long to answer that one, either, as Artemi Panarin had a bouncer get passed Bobrovsky, his old buddy from Columbus, at 8:47 to tie it at 2-2, going into the second period.</p>
      <p>Early in the second, Panarin, who was on the puck all night, found Tony DeAngelo open at the right post — but Bobrovsky made a highlight-reel glove save. Minutes later, Panarin again found DeAngelo is a very similar spot and this time he finished, giving the Rangers a 3-2 lead. Yet the shootout continued as Brett Connolly was able to beat Lundqvist a quick shot from the right dot at 7:51, tying it at 3-3.</p>
      <p>Before the second period could end, the Panthers were pressuring and former Ranger Keith Yandle made a great slap-pass to Dadonov, who one-timed a beauty into the top corner from the right dot, giving Florida a 4-3 lead going into the third.</p>
