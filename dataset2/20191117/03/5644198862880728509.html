      <p>BAKU: A goal and assist from Harry Wilson ensured Wales kept alive their hopes of automatic Euro 2020 qualification with a straightforward 2-0 win over Azerbaijan in Group E on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The on-loan Liverpool forward set up Kieffer Moore's headed opener in Baku with a 10th-minute corner to the far post and then headed home himself from close range on 34 minutes after Daniel James's spectacular shot rebounded off the crossbar and upright.</p>

      <p>Wales also had a second-half effort from Tom Lockyer disallowed as they secured their first away win in more than a year. The victory moved Ryan Giggs' side, who are already guaranteed a playoff place, up to third in the group, one point ahead of Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Wales will qualify automatically if they beat second-placed Hungary in Cardiff in their final game and Slovakia drop points against Croatia later on Saturday or against Azerbaijan on Tuesday.</p>
