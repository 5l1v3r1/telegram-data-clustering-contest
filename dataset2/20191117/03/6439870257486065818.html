      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Devonte’ Graham made his ninth 3-pointer of the game with 2.8 seconds remaining, finishing with 29 points to lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 103-102 victory over the New York Knicks on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>P.J. Washington scored 19 points, Terry Rozier had 16 and Marvin Williams added 13 off the bench for the Hornets, who won on a late 3-pointer for the second straight night.</p>
      <p>RJ Barrett scored 22 points and Mitchell Robinson had 17 points and 12 rebounds for the Knicks.</p>
      <p>Charlotte was down by 15 in the third quarter before taking the lead to start the final period on Graham’s 3 for a 78-76 advantage. The Knicks recovered to take an 88-80 lead midway through the quarter before the Hornets charged back.</p>
      <p>Julius Randle drove to the basket a missed a shot with the Knicks leading 102-100. As the Hornets advanced the ball down the court, coach James Borrego raced down to midcourt to call a timeout.</p>
      <p>Washington found Graham near center court before he dashed to the left side of the arc and fired off a 28-foot attempt over New York’s Frank Ntilikina for the game-winner.</p>

      <p>Hornets: Charlotte won at Detroit on Friday on Malik Monk’s winning 3-pointer.</p>
      <p>Knicks: Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis scored 14 points apiece.</p>
      <p>COULD’VE BEEN A KNICK</p>
      <p>Many figured Rozier to New York was a safe bet after the team missed out on signing Kyrie Irving. Instead, Charlotte signed Rozier to a three-year, $58 million deal and the Knicks settled for Elfrid Payton, who signed a two-year deal for $15 million and has not played since the fourth game of the season due to a strained right hamstring.</p>
      <p>“For a second, I thought this was the place. I thought I was going to be a Knick,” Rozier said.</p>
      <p>Rozier, who spent the first four years of his career in Boston and was vocal about seeking a higher role last season, is averaging career highs of 17 points, 4.9 assists and 42 percent shooting from the field.</p>
      <p>“Other things happened and I ended up going to Charlotte,” he said. “It was the interest they showed in me. That was big. The organization believed in me. Why not?”</p>
      <p>FRIENDS FOREVER</p>
      <p>Former Knick Willy Hernangómez wasn’t too happy with the treatment the Madison Square Garden fans gave Kristaps Porzingis in his first game back in New York on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The former first-round pick, who was traded to Dallas last January, was booed during the lineup introductions and jeered even louder each time he missed touched the ball and missed a shot.</p>
      <p>Hernangómez, a former Knick himself who played his first NBA two seasons in New York before moving on to Charlotte, believes his close friend was deserving of a better welcoming.</p>
      <p>“KP knows what happened and everything. The people just see what is public,” Hernangómez said. “But people can do whatever they want, support, boo, whatever. I just feel sad because KP is my brother and he did a lot for this city, the community, the team.”</p>
