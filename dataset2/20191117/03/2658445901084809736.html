      <p>Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State and the All Progressives Congress (APC), traded blame yesterday  on account of  the pockets of violence in some areas during the governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>The election kicked off at 8am with late arrival of materials in some polling units across the eight local government areas especially in Yenagoa, the state capital</p>
      <p>There was an impressive turnout of voters in most polling units as people came out en masse even before the arrival of electoral officers and materials to cast their votes.</p>
      <p>Though the exercise was generally peaceful, there were skirmishes in some local government areas such as Yenagoa, where gunshots disrupted voting in some of the wards and Southern Ijaw, where materials meant for Ward 17 in Koluama 2  were scattered by thugs.</p>
      <p>Thugs invaded some polling units in Opolo, Agudama and Famgbe axis of Yenagoa, shooting sporadically and disrupting voting. But security agencies especially the army and the police repelled them.</p>
      <p>In Sagbama, the Local Government Area of Dickson, there were complaints that the electoral materials were diverted and led to disenfranchising of voters in some wards.</p>
      <p>A former Acting Governor, Chief Nestor Binabo, alleged that all materials meant for Agoro, Ward 11, in Sagbama were hijacked and diverted to Toru-Orua, the community of the governor.</p>
      <p>He said: “I didn’t vote. The reason is that the materials meant for the elections  for my ward Agoro Sagbama were hijacked by PDP thugs and nobody voted in that ward 11 in Sagbama local government.</p>
      <p>“We have protested and we are asking to either go back or cancel whatever results that anybody may summit. The materials were moved from Sagbama, to a place called Bolu-orua and they were loaded into  the  Naval gun boats.</p>
      <p>“The ward headquarters from Bolu-orua is just about ten minutes drive on the water.”</p>
      <p>There was a report that four officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)  were abducted in Bumodi-Gbene in Yenagoa and Ologi in Ogbia Local Government areas, but were later released.</p>
      <p>At Ologi (Ward 03) of Ogbia Local Government Area, a senior electoral official cancelled voting following violence.</p>
      <p>The official, Ukuachukwu Orji, who is the INEC supervisory Resident Electoral Commissioner for Ogbia LGA, said members of the Ologi community stopped the election in the area.</p>
