      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/suzy-cortez/">Suzy Cortez</a> flaunted her flawless figure in some in tiny shorts and a very skimpy top this weekend at an UFC event, and she posted the photos to prove it to her Instagram account on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>The “Miss BumBum” pageant winner looked like a total smokeshow as she posed on the red carpet with the revealing ensemble. Suzy’s ultra-short Daisy Dukes put her muscular legs and curvy hips on full display.</p>
      <p>She paired the denim shorts with an even skimpier white crop top with the letters UFC written across it. The barely-there shirt left little to the imagination as it could hardly contain the model’s ample cleavage while showcasing her rock-hard abs and toned arms in the process.</p>
      <p>Suzy accessorized the outfit with a large watch on her wrist and some calf-high black suede boots. She had her long, dark hair parted to the side and styled in sleek, straight strands that fell over her shoulders and down her back.</p>
      <p>She also donned a full face of makeup for the night out, which included defined eyebrows, bright eyes, a shimmering glow on her face, and pink blush on her cheeks. She finished off the application with a light pink lipstick on her plump pout.</p>
      <p>In the caption, Suzy thanked the UFC for inviting her to the event, and confirmed to fans that she would be at the next event in Las Vegas as well.</p>
      <p>Of course, Suzy’s over 2 million followers couldn’t get enough of the photo, flocking to the share their love for the snap by hitting the like button nearly 3,000 times and leaving over 40 comments in just the first few minutes after the post was uploaded to the network.</p>

      <p>“Wow. You look so beautiful,” one of Suzy’s Instagram followers wrote in the comments section, adding a heart-eyed emoji.</p>

      <p>“She has got to be the hottest woman on Instagram and her body is the absolute best! Thank you Suzy for always going above and beyond for your followers. We love you!” another social media user stated.</p>
      <p>“Wow,” a third person gushed over the Brazilian beauty.</p>
      <p>As previously reported by <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5744785/suzy-cortez-cowgirl/">The Inquisitr</a></i>, Suzy wowed fans just hours before her UFC Daisy Dukes photo when she rocked some very revealing red lingerie with a matching cowboy hat and a bombshell makeup look on social media.</p>
      <p>Suzy Cortez’s fans also loved that photo, which has attracted over 28,000 likes and more than 260 comments in the day since it’s been posted.</p>
