        <figcaption>By late afternoon, the PLA soldiers had left the streets outside Baptist University beside their barracks in Kowloon Tong. It was not clear how many were involved. The PLA garrison in Hong Kong said that when some residents began cleaning, some troops "helped clear the road in front of the garrison gate". A city spokesman said the Hong Kong government did not request assistance from the PLA but the military initiated the operation as a "voluntary community activity".
