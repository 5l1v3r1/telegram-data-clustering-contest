      <p>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A Chinese aircraft carrier fleet has passed near Taiwan, prompting the self-governing island to scramble ships and jets to monitor the situation.</p>
      <p>Taiwan’s defense ministry says the southbound Chinese fleet passed into the Taiwan Strait on Sunday but stayed on China’s side of the waterway that separates the island from China.</p>
      <p>The ministry says Taiwan scrambled ships and jets to monitor the fleet.</p>
      <p>It says Japanese ships were also following the Chinese fleet. The ministry did not give details.</p>
      <p>China has passed aircraft carriers into the strait since Taiwan President Tsai lng-wen took office in 2016. China resents Tsai for declining to see Taiwan and China as parts of the same country and resents her improved relations with Washington.</p>
