      <p>MARINATE your meat, don’t be afraid of making vegies the “hero”, and for the love of summer, clean your barbecue plate.</p>
      <p>Those are the new laws of the barbie according to one of the greatest modern chefs David Chang.</p>
      <p>He fronts Netflix’s <i>Ugly Delicious</i>, is the chef behind the famous Momofuku restaurant and revolutionised fine dining by fusing it with street food.</p>
      <p>But it’s not just his culinary skills that made him the star attraction at this weekend’s Gourmet Escape in Margaret River. He’s a foodie icon who has also been lauded as <i>GQ</i>’s Man of the Year and made <i>Esquire</i>’s “most influential people of the 21st century” list.</p>

      <p>In between dishing up fried chicken on the beach, Chang also got his palate around his favourite Aussie delicacy.</p>
      <p>“Marron is my all time favourite crustacean in the world. We serve it in our Sydney restaurant and it’s got to be from WA,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This is one of the most beautiful places I’ve even visited. I was here in 2012 but I was a bachelor, now I’m a dad but I can’t wait to bring my family out soon.”</p>
      <p>Tourism Minister Paul Papalia was front and centre at Chang’s grill and sampled close to everything from the 150 local producers and wineries inside the Gourmet Village yesterday at Leeuwin Estate. He was thrilled with the turnout despite the heat and compared WA’s visitor numbers to Chang’s popularity.</p>
      <p>“People from all over are interested and talking about WA, the numbers and the amount they are spending is only going up,” Mr Papalia said.</p>
