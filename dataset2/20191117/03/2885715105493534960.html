      <p>Warner Bros and DC’s Joker has surpassed the one billion dollar mark globally, according to Forbes. It has become the first R-Rated film to achieve this feat. The comic-book film stars Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role of the popular Batman villain.</p>
      <p>Joker is also bigger than Christopher Nolan’s 2008 superhero film The Dark Knight, which ended its box office journey with 1.004 billion dollars.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Joker became the most profitable comic-book movie ever. It was reportedly made on a budget of 62 million dollars. It is also the highest-grossing film that did not release in China — an important market for Hollywood movies.</p>

      <p>Todd Phillips has directed the film using a script penned by him and Scott Silver. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, and Marc Maron play supporting roles.</p>
      <p>Joker has scored a rating of 69 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. The critical consensus reads, “Joker gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star — and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>’ film critic Shalini Langer gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars. She wrote in her review, “Phoenix is the embodiment of nervous, anorexic energy in his role. He just doesn’t act with his face — with or without the joker paint. He acts with his entire body, his ribs sticking out, his back abnormally arched, his legs leaning away from him, his feet gliding from under him, his arms flailing about. There is nothing linear about him, unlike the film which, as much as it tries to mould itself to his uniqueness, ends up being completely so.”</p>
