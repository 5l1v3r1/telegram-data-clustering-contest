      <p>The court gives visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the cells where accused people are held when they attend court.</p>
      <p>The public will also see the state’s first purpose-built, high security courtroom and judicial staff will be there to answer questions about the court, which next year celebrates its 50th anniversary.</p>
      <p>District Court Judge Christopher Stevenson organises the open day and said visitors gain insights and valuable information about how the court works.</p>
      <p>“It is very important that the community feel that they can have access to their courthouses<br/>and this is a particularly significant courthouse because it’s purpose-built and it’s where all<br/>jury trials, except a few in the Supreme Court, are conducted,” he said.</p>
      <p>Last year, 477 trials were listed at the District Court and about 15,000 members of<br/>the public were required to attend for jury service.</p>
      <p>Open House Perth happens every November and allows the public to go inside some of Perth's most iconic buildings.</p>
      <p>Office blocks, stunning houses to modern civic spaces are all on the list. This year the Barrack Street Arch is also open for a stickybeak.</p>
      <p>Now in its eighth consecutive year, 400,000 people have taken part in Open House Perth events since it began in 2012.</p>
      <p>The District Court will be open until 4pm Sunday.</p>
