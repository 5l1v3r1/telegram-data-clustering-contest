      <h1>Rapid-fire gun attachments to be outlawed in Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:25:22+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:25</time> by <a rel="author">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Gun attachments that increase the firing speed of rifles, such as those used in the Las Vegas massacre, are set to be banned in every Australian state and territory.</p>
      <p>The federal government is reportedly outlawing the devices and introducing tougher rules for serial numbers on weapons shipped into Australia for better tracking.</p>

      <p>Assistant Customs Minister Jason Wood will put an import ban in place while also demanding states and territories ban the attachments.</p>
      <p>"John Howard made sure Australia had the toughest gun laws, and I have given the green light to make sure Australia continues to be vigilant and have strong regulations," he said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Bump stocks increase the firing speed of semi-automatic rifles and were used by Stephen Paddock when he killed 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017.</p>
      <p>They are banned in Queensland and South Australia but haven't been made illegal in other states and territories, including NSW.</p>
      <p>Mr Wood wants the new rules in place by Christmas, with penalties of up to 10 years in jail for anyone caught importing the devices.</p>
      <p>"Until now, border officers haven't been searching for these devices because they weren't on anyone's radar," he said.</p>
      <p>Under the changes, serial numbers will be standardised on imported weapons and put in the same place on every gun.</p>
