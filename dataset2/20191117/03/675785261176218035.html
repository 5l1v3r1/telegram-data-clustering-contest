      <h1>Scott Brown explains how Virgil van Dijk has made Liverpool a great team</h1>
      <h2>The Celtic star captained the Reds' defender during his two years playing in Scotland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:47:15+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:47</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Hopkinson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-hopkinson/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have become a great team because Virgil van Dijk, the best defender in the world, gives everyone around him the belief that they are great players too.</p>
      <p>That’s the view of Celtic star Scott Brown, who was the Dutchman’s captain during Van Dijk’s two years north of the border.</p>
      <p>Brown said: “Virgil van Dijk is a Rolls-Royce. He cruised it in the SPL and he’s cruising it in the Premier League – he has now shown that he is the best defender in the world.</p>
      <p>“What we’re seeing from him these days is no surprise to me. The only surprise was that, when he left Celtic, only <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> came in for him.</p>
      <p>“Virgil has that willingness to win, a willingness to get better – he improves week in, week out.</p>

      <p>“He played with great players at Celtic and now he’s gone to Southampton and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and played with great players.</p>
      <p>“He makes good players ­believe they can be great players as well, and what he has done at Liverpool too is steady the ship.</p>
      <p>“He has made that team a hard team to beat and that is due to his work-rate. It’s the drive in him, more than anything – you look at him and feel confident.</p>
      <p>“One person in the Premier League has beaten him in a one-on-one in 75-odd games. So it’s that confidence and belief that he puts in you that oozes through the team.”</p>

      <p>Brown got a close-up view of Van Dijk’s immense talent every working day between 2013 and 2015, and reckons the 28-year-old was a class act whatever position he ended up playing in training.</p>
      <p>Brown added: “He could have been a No.10, a No.6… But as a centre-half he is so good.</p>
      <p>“He was one of those you put that trust in, that belief.</p>
      <p>“He comes forward with the ball and you know he’s not going to lose it, he’s so strong he’s going to cruise through.</p>

      <p>“Then he’d hit free-kicks and score for us. So he has everything – he’s great in the air, he’s strong, ­physical and he’s quick.</p>
      <p>“It’s everything everyone wants as a defender and Liverpool are lucky enough to have him.”</p>
      <p>Shaky defence had long been Liverpool’s key problem before the arrival of Van Dijk.</p>
      <p>But Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren are now looking like ­different ­players for having the experience of ­playing alongside the Dutch star.</p>

      <p>Brown said: “Virgil reads the game so well, and he understands it. His first thought is, ‘If he makes a mistake, I can get there’, and he has the pace to do it.</p>
      <p>“He is a step ahead of the game and that’s what makes him a top-quality defender.</p>
      <p>“He knows when to squeeze, he knows when he should sit off, and when to go and win a battle.</p>
      <p>“You can’t win them all... but most of the time Virgil does.”</p>
