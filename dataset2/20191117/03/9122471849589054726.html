      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa Issues Statement About His Season-Ending Injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:20:44+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has taken to Twitter to address his season-ending hip injury, suffered late in the first half of today’s blowout win over Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, whose college career is likely over, wanted to thank everyone for the well wishes.</p>
      <p>“Thank you all for the prayers and well wishes! God always has a plan,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Alabama announced earlier this evening that the Heisman Trophy contender would miss the rest of the season with his injury, though he is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

      <p>Tagovailoa suffered an apparent hip injury late in the first half against Mississippi State. He was airlifted to a Birmingham hospital.</p>
      <p>Alabama issued an update on his status hours ago:</p>

      <p>The Crimson Tide will now turn to quarterback Mac Jones, who finished the game against Mississippi State and played earlier this season when Tagovailoa had his ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Alabama will take on Western Carolina next weekend before playing Auburn in the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has yet to announce his future plans, though he’s expected to declare for the NFL Draft.</p>
