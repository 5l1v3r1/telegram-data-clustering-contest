      <h1>Dabo Swinney Comments On Injury To Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:19:38+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Alabama’s star <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/breaking-tua-tagovailoa-is-reportedly-out-for-the-season">quarterback suffered a season-ending injury</a>.</p>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa, who entered the game with a questionable designation, was carted off the field after dislocating his hip. He was flown to a hospital in Birmingham where he was diagnosed with a dislocated hip and partial hip fracture.</p>
      <p>It’s a devastating blow for Tua, his family and the Alabama football program.</p>
      <p>But one college football coach knows it’s much more than that. It’s a blow to football as a whole.</p>
      <p>Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney raved about Tua when asked about the quarterback’s season-ending injury.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://www.thestate.com/sports/college/acc/clemson-university/article237451304.html">The State</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Obviously that’s a big loss for them. It’s a big loss for college football, because Tua, he’s a special player. You hate to play against him, but you have great respect for guys that you know do things the right way. He’s just the epitome of a winner. Just a great winner. I hate that for him, but I’m sure they’ve got great doctors and he’ll bounce back. It won’t be the last time you see Tua,” Swinney said.</blockquote>
      <p>Tua’s college career could be over, but he’s expected to fully recover from the devastating injury, which is great news for his pro prospects.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest on Tua.</p>
