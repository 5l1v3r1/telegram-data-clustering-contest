      <p>Dvorak and Brahms</p>
      <p>Four and a half stars.</p>
      <p>Australian Chamber Orchestra</p>
      <p>City Recital Hall November 16</p>
      <p>The Australian Chamber Orchestra augmented its forces for its final concert of the year.</p>
      <p>It roughly doubled the size of the strings and added wind, brass and percussion, and crowded the chamber-music sized stage of the City Recital Hall with 52 players, about three times its normal capacity, for Dvorak’s Symphony No. 8 in G major, Opus 88.</p>
      <p>The effect was thrilling but the bulking up was not primarily aimed at emulating a full symphony orchestra, which would have used 70 to 80 players and, in any case, has a different sound ideal which strives towards collective vigour and symphonic blend.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the ACO aspires towards a leaner tone built from the energised engagement of each individual instrumentalist and this aesthetic ideal is present even when playing as a larger group.</p>

      <p>Led by the soloists, violinist Richard Tognetti, cellist Timo-Veikko Valve and first violinist Helena Rathbone, the ACO began Brahms’ Double Concerto for Violin and Cello in A minor, Opus 102 with a tempo of weighty seriousness, and avoided indulgent tempo changes.</p>
      <p>The expressive element instead focused on tone, shape and fidelity to idea. The second movement, Andante, had a welcome forward-moving quality, finding variety in tonal variation and melodic shape and the last movement was spurred by sinewy vitality.</p>
      <p>Valve’s playing was warmly coloured, while Tognetti’s had astringent sweetness and clarity.</p>
      <p>A highlight of Dvorak’s symphony after interval, conducted by Tognetti, was the distinctive colour of the woodwind playing, particularly in the second and last movement, with comely, rounded-edged flute tone (on wooden flute) from Sally Walker.</p>
      <p>Dvorak’s finale begins with trumpet fanfare, a moment anticipated at the start of the concert with Andrew Ford’s <i>Fanfare for Neverland</i> for solo trumpet played with brilliant control by Visa Haarala.</p>
      <p>Starting with short, initially tentative, rhythmic and pitch motives, the work opens out progressively into the instrument's higher regions as though learning to fly.</p>
      <p><i>Gran Turismo</i> by American composer Andrew Norman, which followed without a break, was a frenetic tour de force of ensemble playing led by Satu Vanska, driven by video-game hyperactivity and frantic, motoric bowing constantly threatened by swerving textures and new meters that appeared from nowhere.</p>
