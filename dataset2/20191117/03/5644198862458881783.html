      <p>Slovenia kept alive the faintest of hopes of qualifying for Euro 2020, at least for another couple of hours, when an own goal by Igors Tarasovs gave them a 1-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Latvia in Group G on Saturday.</p>
      <p>LJUBLJANA: Slovenia kept alive the faintest of hopes of qualifying for Euro 2020, at least for another couple of hours, when an own goal by Igors Tarasovs gave them a 1-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Latvia in Group G on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate Tarasovs turned the ball into the net at the far post in the 53rd minute after Josip Ilicic beat his marker and fired in a low cross from the right.</p>

      <p>Third-placed Slovenia moved on to 14 points from nine games, two behind Austria who were at home to North Macedonia later on Saturday needing a point to join Poland as the group's two qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Even if Austria lose, they would still need another defeat in Latvia on Tuesday to miss out on qualification - unlikely as Latvia have lost all nine games so far - while Slovenia themselves would also have to beat leaders Poland away.</p>
      <p>Slovenia, whose only appearance at the finals was in 2000, created enough chances to have won more comfortably with Jasmin Kurtic curling a dipping shot onto the crossbar in the first half.</p>
      <p>They nearly paid late in the game when their goalkeeper Jan Oblak was forced to make a difficult one-handed save from Vladislavs Fjodorovs and deny Latvia their first point in the group.</p>
