      <h1>Idina Menzel Releases Yule Log Video For Her Christmas Duet With Ariana Grande A Hand For Mrs. Claus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:35:23+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:35</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>Idina Menzel teamed up with Ariana Grande for the song “A Hand For Mrs. Claus” on what is Idina’s second Christmas album. The album’s name is <i>Christmas: A Season Of Love</i> and it features several special songs and duets. Idina sings a solo version of “Seasons Of Love” that she performed as part of the <i>Rent</i> cast. She also wrote the song “At This Table” which is an incredibly beautiful ballad about inclusiveness during the holidays. As for Idina’s and Ariana’s duet “A Hand For Mrs. Clause,” Oscar-winning team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and her husband Robert Lopez wrote “A Hand For Mrs. Clause.” They also wrote the song “Let It Go” from <i>Frozen.</i></p>
      <p>While songs like “At This Table” are very serious that certainly isn’t the felling for the whole album. <i>Christmas: A Season Of Love </i>begins with many upbeat songs that have a jazz or even swing feel to them.</p>
      <p>“A Hand For Mrs. Clause” is a fun song with an uplifting beat. The song speaks of how Mrs. Clause is in the background doing all the work while Santa Claus gets all of the praise and attention.</p>
      <p>The chorus says the following.</p>
      <blockquote>“She just gets no respect. She works so hard. Now I’ll sing a fa-la-la. And I’ll shout a ho-ho-ho. But I’m bouncin’ out this ballad for the gal who runs the show. Join me in this very worthy cause. How ’bout a hand for? (ohh yeah). Let’s make it grand for (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh). Everybody stand for Mrs. Claus.”</blockquote>
