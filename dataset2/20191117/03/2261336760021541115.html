      <p>The UFC Sao Paulo co-main event just closed out with UFC Hall of Famer, Shogun Rua, fighting to a split draw with Paul Craig. Shogun rallied after a rough opening round, and is currently the promotion’s #14 ranked light heavyweight. As for Craig, this is the best he’s ever looked on his feet.</p>
      <p>Craig started hot, throwing an assortment of kicks and backing up the veteran. They spent a lot of time in the clinch, but there was a moment where Craig broke apart and just started throwing all the punches. Shogun weathered the storm and landed a few solo strikes here and there, but the opening act was all Craig.</p>
      <p>The second round was completely different than the opening act. Shogun came out and scored a takedown and landed some quality ground strikes. He would stand up above Craig and dive in with a big punch. He did this several times. Craig did not return to his feet that round.</p>
      <p>Craig ended up on his back again in the final round after flopping to his back from botching a takedown. He struggled to sweep and lock up a submission attempt. Shogun went back to standing up and diving in with a punch. Craig finally stood to his feet but ate a hard two-piece from Shogun. Craig blasted a takedown to end the round on top.</p>
