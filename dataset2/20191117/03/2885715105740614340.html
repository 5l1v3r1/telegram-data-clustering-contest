      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:23:51+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>On Friday evening and Saturday morning, Delhi emerged as the most polluted city in the world, as per two separate private AQI monitoring resources.</p>
      <p>Air Visual AQI monitors and Skymet both said Delhi was the most polluted city in the world Friday with an AQI of 527. On Saturday morning, the AQI was also close to 500.</p>
      <p>AQI is based on the concentration of pollutants in the air. In Delhi, the primary pollutant is usually Particulate Matter and for the past week, it has been PM 2.5. India’s national anti-pollution agency, CPCB, also has an AQI monitor of its own. This however, calculates AQI only till 500.</p>
      <p>While Saturday started out as a severely polluted day, high wind speed helped improve the situation by the afternoon, with other cities such as Tashkent, Lahore, Hangzhou (China) and Chongqing (China) overtaking Delhi on the world’s polluted city index.</p>
      <p>During late evening, as temperatures dipped, the AQI increased and Delhi (198) reached the third spot, behind Lahore (208) and Tashkent (262).</p>
