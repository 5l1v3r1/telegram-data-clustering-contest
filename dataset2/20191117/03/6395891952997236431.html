          <figcaption>Louisiana's Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone greets supporters and talks to media on a campaign stop at New Orleans International Airport in Kenner, La., Monday, Nov. 4, 2019. Rispone says a radio ad linking him and President Donald Trump to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is "disgusting." Rispone is blaming Democratic incumbent John Bel Edwards for the advertising by the New Orleans-based Black Organization for Leadership Development. There's no evidence Edwards is connected to the effort. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)<cite>Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
