      <p>Australia fast bowler James Pattinson was suspended on Sunday for player abuse, ruling him out of the first Test against Pakistan this week.</p>
      <p>The paceman was found guilty of breaching Cricket Australia's code of conduct during Victoria's Sheffield Shield game against Queensland last week.</p>
      <p>It was not clear what he said, but the governing body characterised it as "personal abuse of a player while fielding".</p>
      <p>Given it was his third breach in the past 18 months, the incident triggered a one-match suspension.</p>
      <p>"We have a duty to uphold the highest standards of behaviour and the action taken in this matter demonstrates that," CA's head of integrity and security Sean Carroll said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Pattinson's ban opens the door to Mitchell Starc to play in the Test at Brisbane starting Thursday.</p>
      <p>The two were seen to be competing for one bowling slot to partner Josh Hazelwood, Pat Cummins, and Nathan Lyon.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake in the heat of the moment," said Pattinson, who admitted the offence.</p>
      <p>"Straight away I realised I was in the wrong, and I apologised immediately, both to the opponent and to the umpires.</p>
      <p>"I have done the wrong thing and accept the penalty. I'm gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine." CA said no replacement will be called up for the Test squad.</p>
