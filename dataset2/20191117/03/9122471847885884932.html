      <h1>College GameDay Announces It’s Headed To Columbus For Ohio State vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-17T03:22:56+00:00">17 Nov 2019, 03:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matt-admin" target="_blank">Matt Lombardi</a></address>
      <p>Next Saturday, Penn State and Ohio State will meet in one of the biggest games of the 2019 college football season. ESPN College GameDay will be in town for the affair.</p>
      <p>ESPN announced the news Saturday night. The show was in Waco, Texas for this week’s showdown between Baylor and Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Ohio State boasts a 10-0 record and is currently the No. 2 team in the College Football Playoff rankings. Penn State, after a close win over Indiana, is 9-1 and No. 9 in the rankings.</p>
      <p>An Ohio State win would secure the Big Ten East title for the Buckeyes. A Penn State victory would give the Nittany Lions the tiebreaker – assuming they can also take care of business against Rutgers.</p>

      <p>Both teams still likely control their own destiny when it comes to the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Ohio State, at this point, likely needs to finish the season undefeated to be part of the mix. Penn State lost to Minnesota last week, but a 12-1 record with a Big Ten title and a win over Ohio State would be hard to ignore.</p>
      <p>Next week’s game is scheduled to start at Noon ET.</p>
