      <p>HONG KONG — Police have fired tear gas at protesters holding out at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as overnight clashes resumed in the morning.</p>
      <p>A large group of people arrived Sunday to try to clean up a debris-strewn roadway. Riot police appeared after the cleaners were warned away by the protesters.</p>
      <p>The police shot volleys of tear gas toward the protesters, who sheltered behind a wall of umbrellas across an entire street.</p>
      <p>The skirmish came hours after intense overnight clashes in which the two sides exchanged tear gas and gasoline bombs. Many protesters retreated inside the Polytechnic campus.</p>
      <p>Protesters have largely retreated from other major universities that were occupied for much of last week, but a contingent remains at Polytechnic.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s anti-government protests have been raging for more than five months.</p>
