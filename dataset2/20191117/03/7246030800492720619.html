      <h1>Cozy Up</h1>

      <p>The cold weather can be hard to adjust to but I know I’m not the only one excited for sweater weather! I’m all about being comfortable and cozy; there’s nothing worse than constantly adjusting an uncomfortably fitted garment all day long – so bring on all the cozy sweaters please!</p>
      <p>My go-to these days is a thick and chunky oversized sweater paired with a cute pair of ankle boots and I’ll be sharing a list of some of my favorite places to shop.</p>
      <p>First, though, I want to talk about values and how they relate to fashion. I know it might sound funny to think about values when reading a fashion column, but let me explain.</p>
      <p>I was recently told that a chunky sweater I was wearing on my blog was “unflattering” so I just want to remind us all that our life mission should not be about looking our thinnest. Let’s be real; the term “flattering” is just code for “slimming;” I like to shop for things that bring a smile to my face and whether it makes me look smaller is not my priority. It doesn’t have to be yours either.</p>
      <p>I know a lot of us spend our entire lives trying to shrink our bodies and be smaller. Children as young as three are terrified of being fat. How sad is that? I think we can do better and it starts with our values and priorities which can be SO hard to challenge with a $70 billion diet industry invested in making us believe that our mission in life should be to shrink our bodies.</p>
      <p>Life is short; too short to spend at war with ourselves. Too short to worry about what’s flattering and makes us look skinniest.</p>

      <p>With all that being said, let’s talk about where to find some fun sweaters for fall and winter, flattering or not!</p>
      <p>•Madewell – they have amazing sweaters from XS-3X in great colors, textures and prints.</p>
      <p>•Anthropologie – they recently expanded their size selection to include up to size 28 and their sweaters this year are incredible! Vibrant colors and some amazing sequin options to choose from.</p>
      <p>•Zara – Their pieces hit every trend so if you’re looking for something fun to add to your wardrobe, they’re a great option to consider. Most pieces can be found in XS-XL.</p>
      <p>•Lou and Grey – You can find them in some of the Loft stores, their standalone stores, or online and they have some really cute options in sizes XS-XXL.</p>
      <p>Other honorable mentions include 525 America, Eloquii, Free People, and H&amp;M for budget friendly options.</p>
