      <h1>Rolling Islanders turn wild rally into shootout win</h1>

      <p>Anthony Beauvillier scored twice during a three-goal, third-period rally, and the Islanders beat the Flyers 4-3 in a shootout Saturday night in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Beauvillier and Mathew Barzal combined to erase a 3-0 deficit in the final 13 minutes of regulation, and Jordan Eberle and Barzal scored in the shootout.</p>
      <p>The Islanders are on a 13-0-1 roll that has vaulted them into second place in the Metropolitan Division behind Washington. It’s their longest stretch without a regulation loss since a 15-game run in 1982.</p>
      <p>After getting stymied by goaltender Brian Elliott for most of the evening, the Islanders broke through when Beauvillier took advantage of the Flyers’ sloppy line change before beating Elliott.</p>
      <p>Barzal slammed one past Elliott on a power play with 6:22 left, and Beauvillier got his fourth goal in two games with 2:04 left.</p>
      <p>Thomas Greiss stopped 28 shots and turned away Sean Couturier and Claude Giroux in the shootout.</p>
      <p>Couturier got the game’s first goal on a wrist shot that deflected off defenseman Nick Leddy’s stick in the first period.</p>
      <p>Ivan Provorov scored on a power play with 24 seconds left in the first. He one-timed Couturier’s feed for his fourth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Oskar Lindblom added his ninth of the season midway through the second period.</p>
