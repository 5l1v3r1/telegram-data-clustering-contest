      <h1>Jody Morris, Jose Mourinho, and all the others who made this Chelsea</h1>

      <h3>Some on Twitter tried to make a big deal out of Jody Morris’ response to Jose Mourinho’s comments. Truth is these are the men who made this Chelsea.</h3>
      <p>Twitter during international breaks is when the real silly stuff happens. All Jody Morris had to <a href="https://twitter.com/morriskid/status/1193829028299452416"><b>tweet was a few lines poking fun</b></a> at Jose Mourinho’s recent comments on Chelsea versus big teams. That kicked off some heated debates that ultimately ended littler further from where they started.</p>
      <p>The easiest answer is that this was a moment between two men who probably disagree on more than a few things but who are also kind of right. Chelsea has not been out played by big teams, but they have not been running rampant against them either. Mourinho’s worries are relevant. And Morris’ fun with them is harder to place but Mourinho’s already criticized this Chelsea team this season. It could be that it is funny that Mourinho is now “worried” about a team he was quick to jump on or it could be something that goes all the way back to Mourinho, academy days, and few breakthroughs into the first team.</p>
      <p>But even that much analysis misses the point. This was a brief nothing moment that should have yielded a chuckle and little more. But the uproar over it shows that these two men have played a great role in the shaping of Chelsea over time to get to this point. They are the men that built this Chelsea side. And there are many more.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theprideoflondon.com/2019/10/24/frank-lampard-allowed-chelsea-chelsea/"><b>The Chelsea culture in its current form</b></a> began under Jose Mourinho over a decade ago. The grit, tenacity, and by any means necessary attitude began then and has carried on to now. It has gone through many iterations, but all the roads lead back to The Special One.</p>
      <p>Of course, that is only one side of it. Another side is the excellent work Morris, Joe Edwards, Neil Bath, and countless others have put into the academy. The style of play and type of player that Chelsea is now benefiting from is all their doing.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard will sit somewhere in the middle. He will remember the culture Mourinho began but he will also be well versed in what this club means to the kids through Morris and company. Then there will be the multitudes of managers that he took a lesson from into his own career as a manager. Not just the tactical side of things, but also the social side of leading.</p>

      <p>And that only begins to scratch the surface. There is of course Roman Abramovich and his ownership. Marina Granovskaia and Michael Emenalo, heavily criticized but also often brilliant. Petr Cech to pick up where those two left off. The countless former players who frequent the training ground and the stadium offering advice and congratulations. Even John Terry, away coaching in Birmingham, has chimed in with his own enjoyment as to what is happening at the club this season.</p>
      <p>Rather than look at the Morris and Mourinho incident as a call to battle, it feels more like a recognition that these two men helped to get Chelsea to this point. From Mourinho first saying he was The Special One to now, people have pushed the club towards this point either on purpose or otherwise.</p>
      <p>Mourinho does still care about Chelsea, in his own cold and calculating “they are little horses” kind of way. Morris too in his uncompromising belief in these players under any circumstances. They are just two of the men who made Chelsea as it is today.</p>

      <p>There is much of the season yet to go, but the Chelsea family, from player to manager, from fan to owner, from Stamford Bridge to around the world is in a good place. Let Morris laugh at Mourinho and let Mourinho try to impart his years of wisdom. Be carefree and keep the blue flag flying high.</p>
