      <h2>Italian businessman Flavio Briatore is widely known for his long stint in F1 where he helped Renault become a championship-winning team</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:54:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Former Formula One chief Flavio Briatore has gone public with his new new girlfriend, law student Bernadetta Bosi - who is 49 years younger than him.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old Italian businessman, who is believed to be worth over Â£300million, was seen kissing his new partner during a recent holiday in Kenya.</p>
      <p>Briatore's romance with Bernadetta, who is studying at the State University of Milan, comes after his divorce from Elisabetta Gregoraci in January 2018 following a nine-year marriage.</p>
      <p>Briatore, who owned English Championship club Queens Park Rangers for three years, is widely known for his long stint in F1 where he helped Renault become a championship-winning team over a decade ago.</p>

      <p>Away from his sporting exploits, Briatore boasts a long list of women he has dated over the years - including model Heidi Klum.</p>
      <p>The Italian and Klum have a child together, Leni, 15 while he also shares a son with Elisabetta Gregoraci called Falco, nine.</p>
      <p>The Italian also dated Naomi Campbell for three years between 1999 and 2002.</p>

      <p>After they split, she told Marie Claire Magazine: "I'm not going to be a trophy. If you expect me to be in the kitchen cooking breakfast in high heels, looking as though I just stepped out of a fashion magazine, it's not going to happen."</p>
      <p>Despite their tumultuous time together, Campbell and Briatore are now on good terms and even enjoyed a holiday together in Kenya five years ago.</p>
      <p>He has made no secret of his dating history and, in 2005, he told Vogue: "I never count, it's not right. I believe every time you go out with somebody you go out because you are looking for something.</p>
      <p>"Always the intention is good. If it's not successful, maybe it's destiny."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10322679/flavio-briatore-dating-student-49-years-younger-than-him/">The Sun</a> , his new flame isn't known in celebrity circles - unlike his previous partners - but was the Pietrasantino Miss Carnival back in 2017.</p>
      <p>Having enjoyed a brief break in Rome, Briatore whisked his new girlfriend away to his private resort Kenya - where he previously enjoyed a holiday with Campbell.</p>
      <p>They were spotted looking cosy on the beach and locking lips by the pool, while the former F1 mogul showed his other half how to play bowls as they relaxed in the sunshine.</p>
