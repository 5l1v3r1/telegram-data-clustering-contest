      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 12 — With its release later this month, Lionsgate has shared another new clip from Rian Johnson’s upcoming murder mystery <i>Knives Out</i> that stars Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>
      <p>The film is an Agatha Christie-style mystery that sees Craig’s Detective Benoit Blanc investigate the death of renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer).</p>

      <p>The synopsis of the film reads: “Acclaimed writer and director Johnson pays tribute to mystery mastermind Agatha Christie in Knives Out, a fun, modern-day murder mystery where everyone is a suspect. When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan’s dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan’s untimely death.”</p>
