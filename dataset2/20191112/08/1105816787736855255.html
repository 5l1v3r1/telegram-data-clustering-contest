      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Federal cabinet’s sub-committee meeting is under way in Islamabad to deliberate over an application filed by PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif seeking the removal of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL) on humanitarian grounds.</p>

      <p>Federal Law Minister Dr Farogh Naseem is presiding over the meeting.</p>
      <p>Special Assistant to the PM Imran on Accountability Shahzad Akbar, Nawaz Sharif’s personal medic Dr Adnan and a representative of Shehbaz Sharif, Atta Tarrar are attending the meeting.</p>
      <p>Secretary health and head of the medical board, treating the former prime minister, is briefing the cabinet’s sub-committee over Nawaz’s health condition.</p>
      <p>The recommendations of the sub-committee meeting will be later presented at the federal cabinet meeting today.</p>
      <p>For the last couple of days, a section of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is pressuring Prime Minister Imran Khan not to allow former premier Nawaz Sharif to go abroad for medical treatment, saying it would be a complete defeat of the government’s accountability narrative.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, another section of the PTI believed that Nawaz’s departure would be beneficial politically as the same was done in Musharraf’s case by sending him abroad and easily ruling the country for the next five years.</p>

      <p>A PML-N senior lawyer was hopeful that the cabinet committee would recommend removal of Nawaz’s name from ECL today (Tuesday), saying that the PML-N chief was genuinely ill and the government could not afford to take any risk.</p>
