      <p>While opinion polling showed that a majority of Israelis are not interested in settling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted on Monday that the continuation of this conflict is an obstacle to establishing relations or developing existing relations with the Arab world.<br/><br/>Netanyahu’s remarks came during a speech he gave at a conference marking 25 years since the peace agreement with Jordan was signed.<br/><br/>He also noted that his government maintains relations with six Arab countries, and has a strong desire to establish relations with more, but it often clashes with the barrier of the Palestinian cause.<br/><br/>Arab states, even Egypt and Jordan, demand a settlement of the Palestinian issue first.<br/><br/>The conference was put together by Israeli lawmaker Merav Michaeli and included members of Knesset and Netanyahu. <br/><br/>The Israeli prime minister claimed that his country is providing aid to Jordan both publicly and covertly.<br/><br/>Israel had sought to stage a joint event to commemorate the current 25th anniversary of its peace agreement with Jordan, but Amman refused, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Monday.<br/><br/>This conference coincided with the publication of the results of a poll on Israeli attitudes towards foreign relations, which indicated that the majority of Israelis are not interested in the peace process with the Palestinians.<br/><br/>The 2019 Israeli Foreign Policy Index by the Mitvim Institute showed that if Blue and White leader Benny Gantz were to become prime minister, 25% of the respondents said that Israel’s foreign relations would improve, 30% that they would deteriorate and 27% that there would be no change.<br/><br/>However, 71% of the respondents stated that the peace with Amman was and still is a strategic asset for Israel. Moreover, 68% of the respondents answered that cooperation with other Middle Eastern countries was possible.<br/><br/>When asked which country in the world is the most important for Israel after the US, almost half of the respondents (48%) said Russia, representing a six point increase since 2018.</p>
