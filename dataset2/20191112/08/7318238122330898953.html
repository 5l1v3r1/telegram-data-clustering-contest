      <p>President Ashraf Ghani said on national television Tuesday that the prisoner exchange would free two American University professors — U.S. citizen Kevin King and Australian citizen Timothy Weeks. The two were kidnapped at gunpoint from the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul in August 2016.</p>
      <p>Taliban commanders Anas Haqqani, Haji Maali Khan and Abdul Rasheed Haqani are also set to be released, the president said. Ghani said the three are members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network and are being released "conditionally in exchange" for the two professors, the Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>Ghani said in a statement live on state television Tuesday that the release of the prominent insurgents was a very hard decision that he made in the interest of the Afghan people, according to the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>The release of the Taliban officials is intended to show Afghanistan's government's willingness toward peace talks, the president said.</p>
      <p>Ghani said that the decision by Afghanistan's government to release the Taliban prisoners was made after consultation with the international community and the United States.</p>
      <p>Taliban fighters have been battling U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces since they were toppled in 2001 after their government sheltered 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.</p>
      <p>Anas Haqqani is the son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, who founded the Haqqani terror network under his name in the 1970s. Anas Haqqani has been in Afghan custody <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/bowe-bergdahl-released/afghanistan-arrests-two-key-haqqani-network-commanders-n227216">since October 2014</a> when U.S. security forces nabbed him while en route to Qatar from Bahrain.</p>
      <p>Last year, his name topped the list of those <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/afghan-taliban-seek-prisoner-swap-u-s-attempts-broker-peace-n909556">the Taliban said must be released</a>, according to Taliban officials at the time.</p>
