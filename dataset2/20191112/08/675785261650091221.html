      <h1>I'm A Celebrity romances 2019: Single campmates most likely to couple up this year</h1>
      <h2>One of this year's bunch has already boasted they're 'planning to embrace the single life'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:58:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Needham, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>There might be Bushtucker Trials, hunger pangs and creepy critters aplenty, but the I'm A Celebrity jungle has proved the unlikely setting for more than a few romances over the years.</p>
      <p>Who could forget the early flirtations of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> and Peter Andre who got hitched, had two children and transformed their careers after falling for each other on the ITV reality show.</p>
      <p>So what are the chances of this year's bunch getting jiggy in the jungle?</p>
      <p>While some are happily married (Kate Garraway, Jacqueline Jossa, James Haskell, Andrew Maxwell and Ian Wright) and others in living long-term relationships (Caitlyn Jenner and Roman Kemp ) ITV producers have thrown some stars into the mix who might be up for finding love down under.</p>

      <p>Heading up the single bunch in camp this year is Myles Stephenson, 28.</p>
      <p>The Rak-Su singer's last relationship was with Love Island 2017 star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , but the pair parted ways in mysterious circumstances back in August.</p>
      <p>After confirming things were over between them, Gabby begged fans to pass on any information they had about Myles' unfaithful behaviour.</p>
      <p>"The news paper articles are true. I am no longer in a relationship. I hope youse have all had a better week than me! [sic]</p>
      <p>"If anyone else has anything they need to tell me, please do x" Gabby urged on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>While Myles has been very open about his relationship status.</p>

      <p>After touching down in Australia this week, the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner said he was planning to 'embrace single life' - whatever that means.</p>
      <p>"I am single. I have just got out of a relationship but I think I want to be single for a bit and embrace single life!" he said.</p>
      <p>Joining Myles on the singles bench is Girls Aloud legend Nadine Coyle.</p>
