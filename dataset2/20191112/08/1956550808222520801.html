      <p>It's a smashing restaurant (sorry) picking up our <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397997-dubais-best-new-fine-dining-restaurants-2019">Best Fine Dining Newcomer 2019</a>, but instead of breaking plates, OPA! has a cool new dessert.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/opa">OPA Dubai</a> has revealed two Greek-inspired sweet dishes to its Mediterranean menu – one for the chocolate fans of the city, and the other for those looking for a traditional taste of Greece.<br/><br/>Fancy a pud? Try the Chocolate Piato for Dhs65, made with a blend of honeycomb ice cream with a layer of chocolate mousse, topped with chocolate chip cookies crumbs and sour cherries.<br/><br/>The best part? Served at the table, the dessert will be smashed to pieces in true OPA style and is made to be shared.</p>

      <p>As for the other dessert, if an orange filo pie with crushed pistachios and caramel sauce sounds right up your alley, then the portokalpopita is for you.<br/><br/>Priced at Dhs60, the new addition is served alongside white chocolate ice cream.<br/><br/>Looking to try out the rest of OPA’s Mediterranean menu before dipping into its sweet new additions?
