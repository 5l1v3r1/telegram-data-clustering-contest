      <h3>Expletive-Packed Song</h3>
      <p>Rap star YG, whose real name is Keenon Daequan Ray Jackson, drew <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909281076910111-stormy-daniels-to-receive-450000-settlement-over-her-arrest-in-strip-club-all-charges-dropped/">adult film star Stormy Daniels</a> on stage in the middle of his performance at the Camp Gnaw Flog Carnival at Dodger Stadium.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old rapper said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I want you to say your name and say F**k Donald Trump.”</blockquote>
      <p>Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, took the microphone and addressed the crowd:</p>
      <blockquote>“My name is Stormy f***ing Daniels and I am the reason Donald Trump is f***ed.”</blockquote>
      <p>The rapper asked the porn star <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909041076725001-i-have-no-fear-stormy-daniels-willing-to-testify-before-congress-on-trump-hush-money-/">if she really slept with Donald Trump</a>, in a reference to her alleged affair with the US President, to which she replied:</p>
      <blockquote>“No, I just laid there.”</blockquote>
      <p>Stormy Daniels, 40, then sang and danced with YG as the song “FDT” played.</p>
      <p>Fans on social media responded immediately, with many disapproving of the rapper’s provocative move.</p>

      <p>​The expletive packed song “FDT” initially prompted a Secret Service investigation following its release, with YG telling TMZ at the time:</p>
      <blockquote>“Secret Service hollering at the label. They asked to see the lyrics on my album to see if I’m talking about Trump on my album, because if I’m talking about him on my album they’re going to try and take it off the shelves.”</blockquote>
      <p>The rapper had said his song was a means of reaching out to young people and getting them to vote.</p>
      <p>Adult film actress Stormy Daniels made headlines in 2018 by claiming she had a sexual encounter with Donald Trump back in 2006 when he was already married to Melania and later receiving hush money.</p>
      <p>Trump's representing lawyer, Michael Cohen, plead guilty to wiring $130,000 to Daniels during the 2016 elections in violation of campaign finance laws, to silence her from speaking about her alleged intimate encounter with Trump, and was sentenced to three years in jail later that year.</p>
