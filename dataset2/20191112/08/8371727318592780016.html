      <h1>Facebook App Will Let You Customize the Navigation Toolbar and Hide Notification Dots</h1>

      <p>The Facebook app is getting a new update that will soon let you customize the navigation toolbar and remove those annoying red notification dots. Facebook has begun rolling out a new option to bring sense to your navigation bar called <b>Shortcut Bar Settings</b>.</p>
      <p>This update will let users customize the navigation bar so that you can add or remove tabs like <a href="https://techweez.com/?s=Facebook+Marketplace">Marketplace</a>, <a href="https://techweez.com/?s=Facebook+Watch">Watch</a>, Groups, Events, Profile, Friend Requests, News, Today In, Gaming and <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/09/05/facebook-dating-now-official-everything-you-need-to-know/">Dating</a>. You can also silence the notification dots.</p>

      <p>These new features are the social media giant’s efforts to make the app experience less distracting. Last year, Facebook had begun personalizing the navigation bar according to features a user interacted the most with but Facebook was just promoting new Facebook features such as Marketplace and Facebook Watch.</p>

      <h4>How Shortcut Bar Settings work</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Tap and hold on any of the shortcuts on your navigation bar</li>
        <li>A menu will pop-up that will let you either remove that tab entirely or leave it but disable the red notification count overlays.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Another way to access the Shortcut Bar Settings is by clicking the hamburger menu(three lines), scrolling to Settings &amp; Privacy, then Settings, Shortcuts menu and then toggle off any of the Marketplace, Groups, Events and Pages tabs</p>

      <p>Facebook will also let you toggle off Notification dots of the specific tab.[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/magazine/red-dots-badge-phones-notification.html">Read how tiny red dots took over your life</a>]</p>
      <p>“We are rolling out navigation bar controls to make it easier for people to connect with the things they like and control the notifications they get within the Facebook app,” a Facebook spokesperson told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/facebook-shortcut-bar-settings/">Techcrunch</a>.</p>
