      <p>(Reuters) - Mauritian Kate Foo Kune has been stripped of her silver medal from this year’s All African Badminton Championship after she was found to have breached anti-doping regulations, the sport’s governing body said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Badminton World Federation (BWF) doping hearing panel ruled Foo Kone committed an anti-doping violation, resulting in the disqualification of her singles results at the tournament held in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The panel, however, chose not to impose any period of ineligibility on the 26-year-old after it was found that she “bore no fault or negligence”.</p>
      <p>The BWF said in a statement it would appeal the panel’s decision, with Foo Kune cleared to participate in international and national competitions until the final decision on the case.</p>
      <p>“The BWF has decided to appeal the decision before the Court of Arbitration for Sport as it touches upon the interpretation of fundamental principles of the World Anti-Doping Code and the Anti-Doping Regulations,” it said.</p>
