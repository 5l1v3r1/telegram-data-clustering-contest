      <p>Landsec swung to a pre-tax loss in the first half of the year after the value of its retail and leisure assets suffered in an increasingly challenging market for tenants. </p>
      <h3>The figures </h3>
      <p>The company reported a<b> pre-tax loss</b> of<b> £147m</b>, compared to a profit of £42m the previous year, resulting in a <b>loss per share of 19.6p.</b></p>

      <p><b>Revenue profit</b>, the firm’s measure of underlying pre-tax profit, increased from <b>£224m to £225m</b> in the six months to the end of September as net rental income in Landsec’s like-for-like portfolio was offset by a decline at proposed developments. </p>
      <p>The <b>value of the company’s portfolio </b>declined <b>2.8 per cent</b>, driven by a 11.1 per cent fall in retail park value. </p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting </h3>
      <p>As a commercial property developer and investment trust, Landsec has been hit by the challenges facing the UK retail industry. </p>
      <p>During the reporting period a number of shopping centre staples have closed stores, such as Arcadia’s Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. </p>
      <p>Landsec said it is “not immune from these trends” but “where we have been hit by CVAs, our assets remain popular with occupiers and customers”. </p>
      <p>In a statement today the company said: “The retail market continues to be challenging with retailers facing structural change, economic pressures and a rising cost base.</p>
      <p>“This is reflected in asset pricing, with rental values and market yield movements driving significant valuation declines, particularly in regional retail and retail parks. </p>
      <p>“We have seen further high-profile CVAs and administrations in the period, notably Debenhams and Arcadia.”</p>

      <h3>What Landsec said </h3>
      <blockquote>Chief executive Robert Noel said: “Landsec had a good first half, delivering resilient results in unsettled market conditions.<br/><br/>“We have made excellent progress on our £3bn pipeline of development opportunities, with 1m sq ft now on site. Our new products, Myo and Fitted, have landed well with customers.<br/><br/>“We have been proactive in the tough retail market, maintaining high occupancy and protecting income. We have extended our leadership in sustainability by setting further stretching targets.<br/><br/>“And we’ve upped our pace in innovation, introducing better ways to design, construct and manage space.<br/><br/>“With a general election next month and the UK’s proposed exit from the EU further delayed, we remain alert to market risks. However, Landsec enters the next six months with confidence; we’re in a strong financial position, have an exciting development pipeline and are agile enough to seize value-creating opportunities as we see them.”</blockquote>
