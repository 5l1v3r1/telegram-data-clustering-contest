      <p>US-based search engine giant <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>has announced its plan to identify and label websites that typically load slowly by way of clear badging.</p>
      <p>"Badging is intended to identify when sites are authored in a way that makes them slow generally, looking at historical load latencies. Further along, we may expand this to include identifying when a page is likely to be slow for a user based on their device and network conditions," Google's Chrome team said in a blog post on Monday.</p>
      <p>The labelling of sites would take into account historical load latencies and would use badges to highlight when a site is authoured to be slow.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Chrome team is also exploring how to identify sites that will load slowly based on device hardware or network connectivity.</p>
      <p>The company is also considering "context menu," which would involve <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>offering a link showing the typical speeds for the site before a user choose to visit it.</p>
      <p>"Our early explorations will look at a number of Chrome surfaces, including the loading screen (splash screen), loading progress bar and context-menu for links. The latter could enable insight into typical site speeds so you're aware before you navigate," the company added.</p>
      <p>The plan to identify sites that are fast or slow will take place in gradual steps, based on increasingly stringent criteria. The long-term goal of the company is to define badging for high-quality experiences, which may include signals beyond just speed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>also highlighted a couple of tools - PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse - as starting points to evaluate the performance of a website and encourages owners not to wait to optimize their sites.</p>
