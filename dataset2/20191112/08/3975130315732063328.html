      <h1>UCLA Now Has the First Zero-Emission, All-Electric Mobile Surgical Instrument Lab</h1>

      <p>UCLA's new mobile surgical lab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/ucla-now-has-the-first-zero-emission-all-electric-mobile-surgical-instrument-lab/">is a zero-emission, all-electric vehicle</a> that will move back and forth between two UCLA campuses, collecting, sterilizing and repairing surgical instruments for the medical staff there. TechCrunch reports: <i>Why is that even needed? The usual process is sending out surgical instruments for this kind of service by a third-party, and it's handled in a dedicated facility at a significant annual cost. UCLA Health Center estimates that it can save as much as $750,000 per year using the EV lab from Winnebago instead. The traveling lab can operate for around eight hours, including round-trips between the two hospital campuses, or for a total distance traveled of between 85 and 125 miles on a single charge of its battery, depending on usage. It also offers "the same level of performance, productivity and compliance" as a lab in a fixed-location building, according to Winnebago.</i></p>
