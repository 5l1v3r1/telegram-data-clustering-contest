      <p>ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday he would tell US counterpart Donald Trump that Washington must do more to implement a cease-fire deal they agreed in order to halt Turkey’s offensive in Syria.</p>
      <p>As he prepared to leave for Washington, Erdogan told reporters: “I will tell him, with the use of documents, that the agreement we reached on the operation has not been fully implemented.”</p>
      <p>Turkey struck a deal with the United States on October 17 to suspend its military offensive in northern Syria, in return for Washington ensuring a pullout of Syrian Kurdish forces from a proposed “safe zone.”</p>
      <p>Ankara concluded a separate deal with Russia a few days later under which Moscow agreed to ensure the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from adjacent areas.</p>
      <p>Turkey launched the offensive last month to push Kurdish militants back from its border and create room to repatriate Syrian refugees.</p>
      <p>But Erdogan said Kurdish “terror groups” had still not left key towns, including Manbij, Tal Abyad, Qamishli and Tal Rifaat.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, as of now it is not possible to say terror groups have withdrawn from the region,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Neither Russia nor the United States could remove terror groups within the given hour and the given day.”</p>
      <p>The Turkish leader said he would raise the issue with Trump, and after his return, with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone.</p>
      <p>Erdogan’s visit to Washington comes at a tense time in bilateral ties because of disputes over the Syrian conflict and the US House of Representatives recognizing the mass killing of Armenians a century ago as genocide.</p>
      <p>But Erdogan said: “Despite the fog in our relations, we are in agreement ... with Mr. Trump to improve our relations.”</p>
