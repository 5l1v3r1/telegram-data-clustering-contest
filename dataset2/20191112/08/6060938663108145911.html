      <p>HONG KONG: Indian shuttler Sourabh Verma on Tuesday qualified for the main draw of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> after winning both his qualification round matches.</p>
      <p>Sourabh defeated Thailand's Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk 21-15, 21-19 and Lucas Claerbout of France 21-19, 21-19 to make it to the main draw of the $ 400,000 tournament.</p>
      <p>The first qualification match, which lasted for 45 minutes, started on an even footing, with Tanongsak replying every time Sourabh took the lead.</p>
      <p>However, Sourabh managed to get to the break one point ahead. At 8-8, Tanongsak took the lead but Sourabh rallied to get back on level terms and then went on to win the game with a six-point margin.</p>
      <p>The second game turned out to be a more closely fought contest. However, the Indian held his nerves and went on to win the game 21-19.</p>
      <p>The second match against Lucas, which lasted for 47 minutes, was a tighter one that the first as the Indian had to be at his absolute best to emerge victorious.</p>
      <p>Sourabh will be playing his first round men's singles match on Wednesday. World number 10 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kidambi-Srikanth">Kidambi Srikanth</a>, B Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma, H S Prannoy and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Parupalli-Kashyap">Parupalli Kashyap</a> will also be in action in the men's singles event.</p>
