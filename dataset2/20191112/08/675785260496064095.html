      <h1>Jurgen Klopp asks UEFA for change as Liverpool boss speaks out at managers' summit</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool chief met up with the likes of Pep Guardiola, Thomas Tuchel and Erik ten Hag at the UEFA coaches' conference in Nyon on Monday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:17:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:17</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> has called on UEFA to make further changes to the VAR system.</p>
      <p>The Reds boss met with a host of Europe's best coaches, including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> rival Pep Guardiola and Paris Saint-Germain chief Thomas Tuchel at the UEFA coaches' conference in Nyon on Monday.</p>
      <p>And the German at the home of European football's governing body to insist that the use of VAR had to be improved.</p>
      <p>"VAR can be improved, it can. It will never be 100 per cent accurate, everybody knows that," Klopp is quoted as saying.</p>
      <p>"But there are a couple of things that are not right.</p>

      <p>"With VAR, handball, offside, it is clear we have to keep on improving.</p>
      <p>"There were good ideas from UEFA (about) how we can sort things from the referees, so everybody is in on it.</p>
      <p>"There is still space for mistakes. These things are done by human beings and none of us is perfect.</p>
      <p>"Nobody is asking for perfection, you just want to have the right decisions."</p>

      <p>Klopp voiced his concerns little more than 24 hours after Liverpool's 3-1 win over Man City sent them eight points clear in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Merseysiders' were the beneficiary of a couple of VAR calls, with City having two penalty appeals rejected - one at the start of the build-up to Fabinho's opening goal.</p>
      <p>Klopp and Guardiola spoke post-game on the subject and agreed that the system still needs improving, with the Spaniard having also been aggrieved after the dismissal of Claudio Bravo in the Champions League draw with Atalanta.</p>

      <p>UEFA assistant general secretary Giorgio Marchetti said uniformity was needed but called for time for the promising new system to bed in.</p>
      <p>"Now we have VAR, it's quite useful that coaches and representatives of referees can speak together," Marchetti said. "Let's not forget VAR is very young and it's a revolution in the game. "What we all need is uniformity.</p>
      <p>"There are points which need to be fine-tuned, but you have to look at the positive points that VAR brings."</p>
      <p>Klopp also again questioned world football's increasingly-crowded fixture schedule.</p>
      <p>"The discussions on that are really important and we have to start them."</p>
      <p>Klopp has recently criticised what he perceives as a lack of communication between separate governing bodies when planning competitions, amid his side's Club World Cup/Carabao Cup fiasco.</p>
      <p>"I do not want to cancel English cup competitions - but the problems are obvious," he stated recently. "We respect the competitions.</p>
      <p>"The situation is clear. There would be a few solutions possible, but there was not one day where FIFA, UEFA, the Premier League, the Football League, that they have to sit at a table and think about the players and not about their wallet."</p>
