      <h1>How important will Marvel’s Disney+ shows be in understanding the Cinematic Universe?</h1>
      <h2>Don’t think of it as extra homework, yet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:01:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Marvel Studios Kevin Feige kicked off a chorus of complaints last week after declaring that in order to understand everything happening in future Marvel movies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-07/inside-disney-bob-iger-on-star-wars-pixar-and-more">people would have to subscribe to Disney+.</a></p>
      <p>Disney executives Ricky Strauss and Agnes Chu, both directly involved in overseeing Disney+ content, further explained Feige and Marvel’s approach to connecting with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <i>WandaVision</i>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18307030/marvel-studios-winter-soldier-falcon-scarlet-witch-vision-disney-plus-streaming-service">a series that stars Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany as Vision</a>, is the go-to example. Both that series and <i>Loki, </i>the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17878526/loki-scarlet-witch-disney-streaming-tv-show-marvel-cinematic-universe">Disney+ Marvel series that focuses on Tom Hiddleston’s popular character</a>, will play into the second Doctor Strange movie, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20702328/marvel-disney-plus-thor-eternals-doctor-strange-wandavision-hawkeye-black-widow-san-diego-comic-con"><i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>“Specifically with a series like<i> WandaVision</i>, you will get to understand more about the Scarlet Witch in a way that informs her character, which we will see from her in future Marvel movies,” Chu told <i>The Verge</i>.</p>
      <p>Neither executives specifically addressed just how much Scarlet Witch’s arc in <i>WandaVision </i>would relate to <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </i>plot-wise. Instead, both reiterated that having Feige heading development on both the film and TV side would help keep it consistent.</p>
      <aside>“When those stories are over in those seasons, they can migrate back to the big screen, and then back to Disney+”</aside>
      <p>“Kevin’s a genius, and he has so many different stories that he wants to tell with such a large variety of Marvel characters,” Chu added. “Some of them are better told in an episodic format. There’s just more hours where you can really get in-depth with those characters.”</p>
      <p>Spacing out theatrical releases and new Marvel shows on Disney+ should help fans from burning out on the MCU, according to Disney executives. It’s not just Marvel movies that will receive this treatment; there are several Star Wars projects in development and some could intersect with new movies in the future. Disney+ gives the company a chance to explore how movies and shows can work together.</p>
      <p>“One of the advantages that we’ve had with Marvel is the ability to take these stories and migrate them from the big screen on to Disney+ in a way that we’ve never been able to do before with episodic content,” Strauss told <i>The Verge</i>. “When those stories are over in those seasons, they can migrate back to the big screen, and then back to Disney+, so the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not just a theatrical play. It’s also for the streaming service.”</p>
      <p>If anyone can figure out how to execute it properly, it’s Feige, but that hasn’t convinced everyone it’s a feat Disney can pull off. Marvel has tried more gimmicky tie-ins, both on- and off-screen. In fact, a portion of Marvel Comics’ run in the ’90s was defined by complex and exhaustive crossover events that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/90s-comic-book-resurgence/">led to ridicule and headaches years later from the comics community.</a> That was pre-MCU, but the idea somewhat continued. Marvel’s <i>Agents of SHIELD </i>aired an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR1W5ZYGVF8">episode directly leading up to <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron </i>in 2015</a>. The move was as much a marketing strategy as it was a content play; intertwining the two helped boost <i>Agents of SHIELD</i>’s ratings and increased attention on <i>Age of Ultron</i>.</p>
      <p>Using <i>WandaVision, Loki, </i>and <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </i>puts Disney in the same boat. Disney wants to grow its streaming service as fast as it possibly can, a difficult feat for any company. Leveraging the popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to boost subscriptions is an exclusive advantage for Disney — one that Chu says is “only something this company can do.”</p>
