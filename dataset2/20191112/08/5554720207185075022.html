      <h1>After Maharashtra, BJP suffers jolt from allies in poll-bound Jharkhand</h1>

      <p>Days after the BJP suffered heartbreak from its ally, the Shiv Sena, in Maharashtra, the saffron party has now faced another round of jolt in poll-bound Jharkhand. This was after Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party decided to contest the assembly polls alone.</p>

      <p>Chirag Paswan, National President of the LJP, was quoted by ANI as saying, “Lok Janshakti Party’s state unit has decided that we will contest alone, on 50 seats of Jharkhand, first list to be released later today.”</p>
      <p>The number of seats that the LJP has said it will contest in Jharkhand is significantly higher than what it had originally asked for originally. Earlier, the party had asked for six seats namely Jarmundi, Nala, Hussainabad, Barkagaon, Latehar and Panki as part of seat-sharing arrangement within the NDA.</p>

      <p>The BJP is facing a bigger headache from another ally, All Jharkhand Students Union, which has fielded a candidate from Chakradharpur assembly seat. The BJP has already announced its candidate, Laxman Gilua, who’s the state unit chief of the saffron party, from here.</p>
      <p>The AJSU and the BJP had contested the 2014 assembly elections together. The BJP knows that it simply can’t upset the Jharkhand-based regional partner since it enjoys a considerable support base in the state. In 2014, the AJSU had won five out of eight seats.</p>
      <p>The Election Commission recently announced the dates for assembly polls in Jharkhand. This year’s assembly polls will be held in five phases with the counting of votes for all 81 seats scheduled for 23 December.</p>
