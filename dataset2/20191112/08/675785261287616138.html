      <h2>WARNING, DISTRESSING DETAILS: British backpacker Grace Millane, from Wickford, Essex, was allegedly murdered by a Tinder date at a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:05:13+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:05</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Grace Millane was pinned down and strangled for at least four to five minutes when she was killed in an Auckland hotel room, a court heard.</p>
      <p>A forensic pathologist said the British backpacker, who was found dead in New Zealand last December during a round-the-world trip, had bruising consistent with her being pinned down with force.</p>
      <p>Describing the cause of death as “pressure to the neck”, Dr Simon Stables said it would need to have been sustained for four or five minutes.</p>
      <p>He told the jury: “It’s not going to happen with a gentle touch. It’s got to be with some force. It takes quite a bit of effort.”</p>

      <p>A 27-year-old man is accused of murdering Ms Millane inside the room during a Tinder date on December 1 or December 2 - her 22nd birthday - last year.</p>
      <p>The Crown has alleged that the man, who cannot be named due to a suppression order, strangled the young woman from Wickford, Essex, during rough sex and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The defence claims Ms Millane died accidentally during consensual sex at the CityLife hotel after she asked him to choke her.</p>
      <p>Ms Millane's mum burst into tears as she heard evidence about her daughter's injuries At Auckland's High Court on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The court was also shown video of the defendant's interview with police after Ms Millane was reported missing., the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12284554">New Zealand Herald</a> reported.</p>
      <p>He was not under arrest at the time and lied to officers, claiming he last saw the Brit at 10pm on December 1 and they parted ways after a "pretty good" date, the court heard.</p>
      <p>CCTV already shown to the jury shows the pair entering the CityLife hotel at 9.40pm.</p>
      <p>The defendant was living at the hotel at the time but told officers he was staying somewhere else, the court heard.</p>
      <p>As he gave evidence, Dr Stables showed a series of photographs from a post-mortem he carried out after Ms Millane's body was  discovered days after her disappearance.</p>

      <p>Using his hands, he also demonstrated how the British woman was allegedly strangled to death.</p>
      <p>He said he was sure the backpacker died from strangulation after he found a deep internal bruise in her neck.</p>
      <p>He added that Ms Millane's death was the first case he had seen in New Zealand of manual strangulation during sex.</p>
      <p>“From my point of view it is incredibly rare. I have never heard of another case... in New Zealand,” he told jurors.</p>
      <p>He told the court that a pattern of bruises on Ms Millane's chest and arms indicated she had been held down.</p>

      <p>A bruise was deep inside the neck, he said, and invisible on the surface, suggesting it happened at the time of death.</p>
      <p>Other, blue bruises on her torso, he said, were “consistent with some level of restraint.”</p>
      <p>Dr Stables rejected a suggestion from defence barrister Ian Brookie that one or more of the bruises could have been a “love bite”.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t resemble one I’ve seen in my experience,” he said.</p>
      <p>But he did agree that some of the bruising on Ms Millane’s arms could be the result of “consensual but physical sex”.</p>

      <p>Despite the effects of a week of decomposition before her body was found by tracking the accused’s cellphone, Dr Stables he had no doubt about the bruise, about 6cm by 3cm below the left side of Ms Millane’s jaw, being caused before death.</p>
      <p>“I think it is not a post-mortem change, it is a real injury,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Stables said that obstructing the blood flow or the airways in the neck to cause death by cutting oxygen to the brain would require between two and five kilograms of pressure.</p>
      <p>And he added: “A 22-year-old woman with no medical history, I wouldn't expect to bruise easily.”</p>
      <p>Mr Brookie told Dr Stables the defence would not challenge the finding of death by manual strangulation but would suggest alcohol had played a part after Grace and the accused had spent the evening drinking cocktails and tequila shots in a number of bars.</p>
      <p>Dr Stables had told prosecutor Brian Dickey that alcohol can “sensitise the heart”, but he said results of a toxicology test showing levels in Grace’s blood of twice the legal driving limit were meaningless because of the effects of decomposition.</p>
      <p>The defendant denies murder.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
