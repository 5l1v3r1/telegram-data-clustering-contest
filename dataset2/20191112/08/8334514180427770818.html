      <p>JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Two people have died amid downpours in an eastern province of South Africa brought down their house, a few months after many were killed in another torrential rain.</p>
      <p>“A man and a woman died when their house collapsed,” Robert Mckenzie, media liaison officer for KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services told Reuters by phone.</p>
      <p>KwaZulu-Natal, a province that sits on South Africa’s eastern coast, was already one of the worst hit by the heavy rains that killed over 70 people in April.</p>
      <p>South Africa’s Weather Service warned further downpours were expected. Local media showed images of flooded and damaged roads.</p>
      <p>KwaZulu-Natal, where many live in flimsy houses without proper foundations or drainage systems, often gets heavy rain, but April’s death toll was rare.</p>
      <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa said during a visit to affected communities at the time that such events were partly down to climate change.</p>
