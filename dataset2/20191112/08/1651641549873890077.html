      <p>Remote Desktop is a technology that helps a local computer connect to a remote computer over a network or the internet. In other words, it allows users to gain access to other PCs remotely.</p>
      <p>If you’re on Windows 10, you can gain access to other PCs and there are multiple ways that you can follow. The easiest way to remotely access a computer is by downloading Microsoft’s Remote Desktop app, and the good news is the app is now available for Windows ARM64 devices too.</p>
      <p>You can now <b><a href="https://t.co/Q5wIxoBV2l?amp=1">download the Remote Desktop app for your Windows ARM64 device from this link</a></b>. Note, this app can only be installed on ARM64 devices, so if you’re using an Intel or AMD-based PC, you won’t be able to install the app from the above link.</p>
      <p>The app currently available in Preview and that means the app might not be as good as its x86 counterpart. Otherwise, if you’re using an Intel or AMD-based PC, you can download the Remote Desktop app from the below link, or hit the Microsoft Store.</p>
