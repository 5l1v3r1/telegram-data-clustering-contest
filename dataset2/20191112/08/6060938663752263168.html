      <h1>Beware! These habits can ruin even the happiest marriage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>No matter how happy married couples may appear, it is not uncommon for even the most ‘perfect’ couple to head for divorce. It is not easy for two people, who were head-over-heels in love with each other, to end a relationship. But somewhere along the way, they realise it is better to head separate ways than to stay together. Sometimes there are irreconcilable reasons behind their decision and at times there are things which the couple could have easily mended to save a marriage. Here are some seemingly harmless habits that can become the bone of contention between partners and avoiding these can make a marriage stronger.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not addressing important issues</b>
      </p>
      <p>When there are problems in a relationship, it’s always best to address the issues as soon as possible. But many prefer to choose the easy way out by not addressing the elephant in the room. Reason? The classic fight or flight syndrome and they keep staying away from the problem till it grows out of proportion. By the time the fight starts, it’s too late.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pulling up old guns in new arguments</b>
      </p>
      <p>We all do that, don’t we? Bringing up old issues, which adds fuel to a fight. This is a habit that should be avoided at all costs. When a partner keeps harping on old issues, it’s not only irritating but can be very infuriating—if you cannot handle your past, how do you plan to manage the present and the future?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Talking behind your partner’s back</b>
      </p>
      <p>What is the first thing a person does after a bitter fight with his or her partner? Call up a friend or family and cry one’s heart out. Sometimes a person may speak in a mean-spirited way about a partner when the person is not around without even realising it. Trust us, sometimes words can be the sharpest weapon that can bleed a relationship to death.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Comparing your spouse with your ex-partner</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes you don’t need to say things out loud—for instance, although no one will admit it, but it is not uncommon to compare a current partner with a former and make little mental notes about it. This habit, which not only hampers a person from appreciating the present, can kill a marriage over time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not respecting personal space of a partner</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is a thin line separating a caring partner from an obsessive lover. After marriage, a lot of people start behaving like a ‘guardian’, especially men. They try to keep a tab on their partners’ activities and some don’t even think twice before checking each other’s phones and emails. Everyone needs a little privacy and such behaviour of a partner can be very frustrating.</p>
