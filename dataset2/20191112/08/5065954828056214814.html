      <p>Former Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin ultimately found his memories of being an avid stamps collector and a hobbyist when he entered the iconic building of the Manila Central Post Office as guest of honor and speaker during the celebration of the 252nd Anniversary of the Philippine Postal Service and the kick-off ceremony of the National Stamp Collecting Month (NSCM) last November 08.</p>
      <p>CJ Bersamin’s fascination with stamps dates back to his childhood when he cut out and soke letter corners to get the stamps and drying them between pages of old newspapers.</p>
      <p>His interest in history pushes him to love collecting stamps. He said stamps are undeniably artifacts or records that also marked and relate history for they depict with vividness epochs or eras of the nation’s life and times.</p>
      <p>He could only wish that more of the younger generation would rediscover and reacquaint themselves with stamps, which are actually miniature artworks. Stamps are still worthy treasures and he hopes that a revival or renaissance that the postal service created will still happen even in this age of technology.</p>
      <p>He congratulated PHLPost during the month of Philately by gathering together loyal philatelists and young artists responsible for creating the artwork that found its way in stamps. </p>
      <p>A ribbon-cutting ceremony led by former Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin, PHLPost Chairman Norman Fulgencio, OIC-APMG for Marketing and Management Support Services Maxie Sta. Maria III and Paranaque City Vice Mayor Rico Golez, son of former Postmaster General Roilo Golez formally opened the “Art of History” Exhibit featuring Artworks of Philatelic Artists in celebration of the 252nd Postal Service Anniversary and Kick-off Ceremony of National Stamp Collecting Month.</p>

      <p>The National Stamp Collecting Month is an annual event observed every month of November under the Presidential Proclamation Number 494 signed by former President Fidel V. Ramos, to celebrate Philately in the country. It aims to create, maintain, and increase postal awareness and interest through various activities that would inspire and encourage Filipinos across all ages to venture into the hobby of stamp collecting. A postage stamp has helped preserved histories and culture of the country.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the month-long celebration of 2019 NSCM, is the launching of the Pinoy Music Icon commemorative stamps to proudly honor three iconic OPM Artists, Hotdog’s Rene Garcia, Rico J. Puno aka “The Total Entertainer” and Pepe Smith (considered as The Father of Pinoy Rock).</p>
      <p>A special exhibition of the Icons’ memorabilia will be opened at the lobby of the historic Manila Central Post Office building in a night filled with music and fun activities on November 15, 2019.</p>
      <p>Other activities include Green and Wild Expo stamp exhibit featuring the beautiful flora and fauna of the Philippines at the SMX Convention Center Aura on November 20-21, LIHAM Fashion Show featuring Filipino traditional courting and national costumes on November 23, Bridging Generations: Philatelic Forum which aims to raise awareness about Philately to young students in partnership with the Royal Thai Embassy on November 27.</p>
      <p>The Pinoy Music Icon stamps are available starting November 11 to be sold at 45 pesos each in a strip of three (3) souvenir sheets at P135. For inquiries, please call 8-527-01-08 or 8-527-01-32.</p>
