      <p>Over the last week, we saw some interesting videos discussing Blender's role in the CG Industry. On the one hand, we saw Flipped Normals reason that big industry studios are entrenched in existing software, making it hard to switch to other tools.

      <p>To close off, I also noticed <a href="https://blenderartists.org/t/why-blender-may-eventually-defeat-maya-an-objective-view/1190272">this topic on Blender Artists by Chipp Walters</a>, who looks at disruption of industries by comparing traditional CG software to Kodak. It's worth a read.</p>
