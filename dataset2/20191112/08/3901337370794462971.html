      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate has sensationally dropped key man Raheem Sterling from England's squad to face Montenegro after the Manchester City star was involved in a bust-up with one of his teammates. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Sterling was dropped from the England squad after reportedly trading words with defender Joe Gomez in training. This follows on from a row between the two stars that occurred during this past weekend's Premier League clash between Liverpool and Manchester City. </p>
      <p>The pair were involved in a minor altercation during the Reds' 3-1 win over City on Sunday, which Sterling took offence to, and according to the <i>Daily Mail,</i> the 24-year-old reignited the feud in the England camp. </p>
      <p>It has been claimed that witnesses heard Sterling ask Gomez if he was "still the big man", which reportedly prompted Southgate to drop his star man. </p>

      <p>The England boss has since explained his decision and stressed that club rivalries could not get in the way of the national team's ambitions. </p>
      <p>"We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday," Southgate said. </p>
      <p>"One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we've been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately, the emotions of yesterday's (Sunday's) game were still raw.</p>
      <p>"My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken. Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it's important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night."</p>

      <p>It is believed that Sterling will remain part of the squad and may feature in England's final international match of the year against Kosovo on Sunday. </p>
