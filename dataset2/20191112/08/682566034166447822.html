      <h1>Middendorp's perfect week sees Chiefs open 10-point PSL lead</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:01:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author">Tashreeq Vardien - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> have opened a yawning <b>10-point</b> lead atop the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/Logs">Absa Premiership standings</a> after match-day 11 of the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Amakhosi were <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/chiefs-beat-pirates-in-soweto-derby-thriller-20191109">3-2 winners in a gruelling Soweto derby clash</a> against arch-rivals Orlando Pirates at a jam-packed FNB Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>That victory was Chiefs' first in four years over their rivals in the Absa Premiership - a relief for the black and yellow side of Soweto.</p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp's charges continue to grind out important victories and the Buccaneers' scalp could not be any sweeter with it being the second win over their neighbours in seven days.</p>
      <p>Chiefs had beaten Pirates in the Telkom Knockout in their quarter-final clash the previous weekend to advance to the semi-finals which will be played after the international break.</p>
      <p>But the cherry on top?</p>
      <p>Current league champions Mamelodi Sundowns suffered a shock <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/sundowns-suffer-shock-defeat-against-golden-arrows-20191110">3-2 defeat against Steve Komphela's Golden Arrows</a> on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians, placed <b>second</b> in the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/Logs">log standings</a>, are now 10-points behind Amakhosi, albeit with a match in hand.</p>
      <p>Sundowns, along with Bidvest Wits, remain Amakhosi's only real threat for league honours.</p>
      <p>Wits are currently <b>fifth</b> on the log with four games in hand.</p>
      <p>However, even if they were to win all those matches, Wits would remain a point behind Amakhosi.</p>
      <p>Sundowns and Wits have been focusing on their respective CAF campaigns with match-day 1 of the group stages set to commence after the international break.</p>
      <p>Pitso Mosimane's charges have their eyes on a second star from the CAF Champions League while Wits continue their CAF Confederations Cup quest.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Amakhosi are now determined to end their major silverware drought with a Telkom Knockout semi-final against Maritzburg United.</p>
      <p>With that 10-point lead, Chiefs are now firm favourites to go all the way in lifting the Absa Premiership title despite 19 matches remaining for the season.</p>
      <p>But anything can still happen.</p>
      <p>When the league resumes, Chiefs have four games before the festive season break - Maritzburg United (Telkom Knockout semi-final, November 23),  Stellenbosch FC (November 27), Bloemfontein Celtic (December 7) and cap off 2019 with an encounter against Maritzburg United (December 22).</p>
      <p>Middendorp will be hoping to end the year off with a trophy and continue - and stretch - their lead at the top of the standings.</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, match-day 11 was certainly the German's best week as Amakhosi coach to date.</p>
