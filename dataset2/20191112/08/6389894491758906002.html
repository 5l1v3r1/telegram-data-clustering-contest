      <p>The information services group narrowed their guidance for the year to seven to eight per cent, the upper range of previous estimates.</p>
      <p>The company said that good momentum in North America, double-digit revenue growth in Latin America and an acceleration in global business to business platforms such as Ascend had helped was responsible for the growth.</p>
      <p>Chief executive officer Brian Cassin commented: “This reflects successful execution on big new addressable market opportunities, the global roll out of our innovative platforms and considerable momentum in Consumer Services as we invest in Experian Boost.”</p>
      <p>The company also saw users of its website for checking credit scores for free rise 56 per cent, from 45m in 2018 to 70m in 2019.</p>
      <p>Experian Ascend, a platform that integrates client data, industry-specific data feeds and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, has reached a value of $270m across the USA, UK, Brazil and Italy.</p>

      <p>The blue-chip announced a number of acquisitions for the period, including South Africa’s Compuscan credit information company, as well as the remaining 45 per cent of subsidiary body Experian MicroAnalytics.</p>
      <p>Experian competes with smaller players Equifax and TransUnion. Both have reported estimate-beating results for the last quarter.</p>
      <p>The company announced a first interim dividend of 14.5 cents per share, up four per cent. In early trading shares in the company were up 2.1 per cent to 2431p. </p>
