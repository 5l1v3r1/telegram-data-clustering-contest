      <h1>Disney doesn’t have plans to bring live-action Spider-Man movies to Disney+</h1>
      <h2>Tom Holland-led Marvel movies are still a Sony product</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:01:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Disney is working to bring the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe collection — 23 titles to date — to its Disney+ streaming service, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892494/spider-man-homecoming-review-tom-holland-michael-keaton-robert-downey-jr"><i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761022/spider-man-far-from-home-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-mcu"><i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i></a><i> </i>are unlikely to be included.</p>
      <p>Ricky Strauss, Disney’s head of content and marketing for Disney+, told <i>The Verge </i>at a recent media day in New York there aren’t any plans to bring the two movies over to Disney+. Although both Tom Holland-led Spider-Man movies, <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming </i>and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home, </i>were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887093/spider-man-marvel-cinematic-universe-sony-disney-tom-holland-kevin-feige">co-produced by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, the rights belong to Sony.</a> That makes it infinitely more difficult for Disney to bring the movies over to its own streaming service.</p>
      <p>“We love our friends at Sony, but we don’t have any plans to have the live-action Spider-Man movies on Disney+ ” Strauss said. “We will have all the Spider-Man animated shows that we did so they’ll be on there under the Marvel banner. But who knows what can happen in the future?”</p>
      <p>Disney has worked out multiple deals to get much of the MCU back. That includes making last-minute deals just days before Disney+’s launch, according to a Disney executive. It explains why there are now several more Marvel titles available on Disney+ than what Disney announced less than one month ago. It also explains this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959998/disney-plus-launch-marvel-titles-iron-man-captain-america-winter-soldier">lengthy thread from the official Disney+ account published earlier today.</a></p>
      <aside>“We love our friends at Sony, but we don’t have any plans to have the live-action Spider-Man movies on Disney+”</aside>
      <p>Then, last week, Disney announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951682/avengers-endgame-disney-plus-launch-title-marvel-movies-star-wars"><i>Avengers: Endgame </i>would be available on Disney+ one month earlier than expected</a>, moving up from December 11th to November 12th. Kevin Mayer, Disney’s head of direct-to-consumer services, told press that it was a one-time occurrence where a movie still within its home release window (the three-month period after a movie leaves theaters) would be cut short. Exceptions were made for <i>Endgame </i>because of Disney+’s launch and there only being a few weeks left in the home release window.</p>
      <p>Netflix will remain a major roadblock for Disney+ at launch. The only films that aren’t on the service are those that will remain on Netflix until the end of 2019 (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977756/black-panther-movie-review-ryan-coogler-marvel-cinematic-universe-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan"><i>Black Panther</i></a><i>, Ant-Man and the Wasp, </i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17276030/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel-iron-man"><i>Avengers: Infinity War</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16501108/thor-ragnarok-movie-review-marvel-chris-hemsworth-taika-waititi"><i>Thor: Ragnarok</i></a>). These four movies will become available on Disney+ beginning in 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/11/16131564/netflix-disney-marvel-star-wars-streaming-2019">once the contract with Netflix expires. </a>It’s also why seven installments in the Skywalker saga will be available to stream on Disney+, but not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/22/16787554/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rey-snoke-parents-questions-mysteries-rian-johnson-jj-abrams"><i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Eventually all Disney IP will end up on Disney+, according to executives. It’s just going to take some time — and patience — for rights to revert back to themselves.</p>
