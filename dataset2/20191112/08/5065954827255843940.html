      <p>Women are generally health-conscious during pregnancy. But no matter how cautious a woman can be, adverse situations may still arise and one of these is the development of pre-eclampsia.       </p>
      <p>Pre-eclampsia is a complication of pregnancy marked by high blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria). The cause of pre-eclampsia remains unknown but studies have shown that it affects blood flow in the placenta, which can lead to pregnancy-induced hypertension and fetal complications such as intrauterine growth restriction and prematurity. Left untreated, it may progress into more severe conditions like eclampsia, wherein the mother develops seizures, and on one extreme, may, unfortunately, lead to death. Various reports show that 5-8 percent of pregnancies are affected by pre-eclampsia worldwide, with 76,000 maternal and 500,000 fetal deaths yearly. In the Philippines, eclampsia was the leading cause of maternal death (19.6 percent) based on local statistics (PSA, 2015).     </p>
      <p>Although the blood pressure of pregnant women tends to decrease in the first trimester, early screening to predict pre-eclampsia can be performed at this time. By the second trimester, symptoms of pre-eclampsia may begin to appear. Undiagnosed and untreated, pre-eclampsia may lead to early delivery during the third trimester.</p>
      <p>Thus, when it comes to pre-eclampsia, timing is of the essence. The earlier women at high risk for pre-eclampsia are identified, the better the outcome for both Mommy and baby.       </p>
      <p>To date, the most sensitive first-trimester test for pre-eclampsia is PLGF 1-2-3. It is the 2nd generation PLGF assay, and when it is used in combination with a comprehensive first-trimester screening program that includes maternal medical history and mean arterial blood pressure, women at high risk for pre-eclampsia can be identified long before symptoms appear. The PLGF 1-2-3 assay can also be used in the second and third trimester of pregnancy for effective reassessment, monitoring,      or diagnosis.    </p>
      <p>Hi-Precision Diagnostics, the country’s leading medical diagnostics laboratory, offers PLGF 1-2-3 in conjunction with the following pre-eclampsia screening tests:   </p>
      <p>•          Pre-eclampsia screening for 1<sup>st</sup> trimester – screening test for pre-eclampsia for patients  in their 1<sup>st</sup> trimester of pregnancy</p>
      <p>o PLGF 1-2-3 (placental growth factor)  </p>
      <p>o PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A)        </p>
      <p>o Risk assessment for pre-eclampsia     </p>
      <p>•          Pre-eclampsia screening for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester – screening for risk of pre-eclampsia for patients in their 2<sup>nd</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup> trimester of pregnancy  </p>
      <p>o PLGF 1-2-3    </p>
      <p>o Risk assessment for pre-eclampsia</p>
