      <p>As you may have heard, <b>Drake</b> was <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/drake-booed-off-stage-during-surprise-camp-flog-gnaw-set/">booed off stage</a> during his surprise set at Tyler, the Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, because there were rumors that Frank Ocean would be the surprise headliner and Drake is not Frank Ocean. Tyler <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tyler-the-creator-responds-to-fans-booing-drake-at-camp-flog-gnaw/">responded</a> with a series of tweets, and now Drake himself has also responded on Instagram. It seems like he’s taking it well: “Plot twist…just signed a 10 year residency at Camp Flog Gnaw sorry kids see you EVERY SINGLE YEAR till you are 30,” Drake joked.</p>
