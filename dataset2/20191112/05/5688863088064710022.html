        <b>England batsman Jonny Bairstow has been reprimanded by the ICC for breaching the ICC code of conduct by reacting to his dismissal during the 5th T20I between New Zealand and England. Bairstow admitted to using audible indecency as he was given out for 47 during their game at the Eden Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>England clinched the T20I series win against New Zealand dramatically as the game was tied and England won the super over. But it all came at a price as <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/jonny_bairstow">Jonny Bairstow</a> later admitted to having breached the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a> Code of Conduct by reacting to the way he got out during the England innings.</p>
      <p>Bairstow has been sanctioned by the ICC and given one demerit point for using an audible obscenity as he edged the ball to the keeper on the bowling of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/jimmy_neesham">Jimmy Neesham</a> in the series decider for 47 runs. He admitted to having breached 2.3 of ICC Code of Conduct as he left Eden Park having reacted the way he did.</p>
      <p>There were scenes of Deja Vu at Eden Park as yet again like the World Cup Final a super over was needed to decide the fate of the game and the series. The match was reduced to 11 overs and New Zealand managed to put a mammoth 146 on the board but England too ended up getting the same amount of runs and taking the game to a super over, thanks to Bairstow's whirlwind innings and some late hitting from <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/chris_jordan">Chris Jordan</a>. But this time, England won the super over comfortably by 7 runs and clinched the series 3-2 and left the New Zealand crowd in disbelief for the second time in six months.</p>
