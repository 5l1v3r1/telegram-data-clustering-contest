      <h1>Apple TV+'s head of scripted and unscripted shows has left the company</h1>
      <h2>Just a couple of weeks after Apple TV+ launched.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:32:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/mariellamoon" target="_blank">Mariella Moon</a></address>
      <p>Apple has lost one its streaming service's top personnel, just a couple of weeks after TV+ <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-launches-today/">went live</a>. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/kim-rozenfeld-steps-down-apple-head-of-current-programming-unscripted-segues-first-look-deal-matt-cherniss-molly-thompson-1202782974/"><i>Deadline</i></a>, Kim Rozenfeld, the head of current scripted programming and unscripted content for Apple TV+, has stepped down from his position. <i>Deadline's</i> report didn't expound on the circumstances behind Rozenfeld's departure, but it did say that he signed a first-look deal with Apple for his production company, Half Full Studios. His <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-rozenfeld-40377a5">LinkedIn</a> page also says he left Apple this month, and that he has a "development, producing and consultant deal with Apple TV+ for scripted and documentary series" under his company.</p>
      <p>Rozenfeld was one of the first people from Sony TV that Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht (former Sony TV heads) hired when they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/16/apple-erlicht-van-amburg-sony-original-video/">went to Apple</a>. There was clearly a shift of some sort in the division after launch, though it's still unclear what that means for TV+. Now that he's exited, the service will combine its development and current programming teams under a single group of executives. Matt Cherniss, who was Rozenfeld's counterpart as head of scripted development, will now also head up the service's current scripted series team.</p>
