      <p>CHENNAI: After almost eight years, the I, J and K stands of the MA Chidambaram Stadium here are likely to be re-opened for the spectators. It means that the galleries will be thrown open for the fans when Chepauk hosts the first ODI between India and the West Indies on December 15.</p>
      <p>The last time Chepauk witnessed a full house was back in December, 2012 during the India-Pakistan ODI.</p>
      <p>It was learnt that the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tamil-Nadu-Cricket-Association">Tamil Nadu Cricket Association</a> (TNCA) and the Chennai Municipal Corporation, which had closed these three stands with a capacity of more than 12,000 due to a few discrepancies, have sorted out the issues and the TNCA subsequently submitted their documents for renewal of the lease of the stadium for 20 years last month. The TNCA is now waiting for the corporation to accept the lease documents and give them the nod.</p>
      <p>"Earlier, the state revenue department was taking time in revising the amount for the lease rent and the time period. But after much deliberations, the lease period was decided to be 20 years rather than the erstwhile 99 years. The state department has asked for receipts from TNCA and several other sports bodies like the MCC and Madras Race Club. After seeing the receipts, they are to decide on the lease rent. According to a Comptroller and Auditor General of India report, there were also issues about the pending rent of Rs 2,081 crore for the period between 2000-2016 from TNCA and Madras Cricket Club (MCC). But it seems that they have reached a settlement on that amount too as the dues were miscalculated because the property tax for a sports body is much less," a source close to the developments told TOI on Monday.</p>
      <p>One of the major issues in contention was the gym at the MCC. The Madras High Court had ordered that 12 metres of the gym needed to be demolished to create eight metres of space between the MCC and the 'K' stand. But TNCA found it difficult to create the space as parts of the MCC have been declared heritage structures by Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). The source said that TNCA has settled this dispute amicably too as the MCC has agreed to pull down the gym.</p>
      <p>"Once the corporation clears the documents, we will approach the High Court to get the order to demolish the gym. It shouldn't be an issue and the gym can be brought down in a day," said the source.</p>
      <p>Due to the closure of the three stands, Chepauk was robbed of several high-profile matches, including those of men's World T20 in 2016 and the IPL final in 2019.</p>
