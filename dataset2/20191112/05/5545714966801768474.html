      <p>Paramount Pictures has released a new trailer for its upcoming movie starring one of the most iconic video game characters of all time,<i> Sonic the Hedgehog</i>. The new three-minute preview features our first official look at the blue blur's redesign, which was implemented following the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../sonic-the-hedgehog-s-director-vows-to-redesign-the-character-after-fan-backlash-552262.phtml">less-than-stellar fan feedback</a> to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer-is-out-and-those-legs-551926.phtml">movie's original trailer.</a><br/><br/>Not only does the preview feature a new (and in my humble opinion improved) Sonic, but it also showcases a glut of fresh clips from the movie, which stars James Marsden and Jim Carrey, and is directed by Jeff Fowler. Also gone is Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise, replaced with a remix of The Ramones' Blitzkrieg Bop. We also see the luscious Green Hill Zone, complete with its famous loop-the-loop. The comedy still isn't working for me, but I'm old and jaded, so don't sweat that, folks.</p>
