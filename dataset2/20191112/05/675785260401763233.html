      <h2>Marcus Miller, 48, from Lanarkshire in Scotland, decided to get a tattoo after losing all his hair during chemotherapy treatments for testicular cancer</h2>

      <p>A cancer survivor has revealed how he was left with a blue scalp after claiming a tattooist botched a fake hair cover up.</p>
      <p>Marcus Miller was left with permanent hair loss after undergoing gruelling chemotherapy treatment for testicular cancer.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-two, from Harthill in Lanarkshire, was left battling depression and low self-esteem and turned to a tattooist for help.</p>
      <p>But having hoped the treatment would improve his look it instead left him in an even worse state, reports the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cancer-survivor-dad-left-blue-20862812">Daily Record</a> .</p>

      <p>He says he was charged £250 to create a black stubble effect all over his head in a series of excruciatingly painful sittings.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, he says the tattooist botched the job and he was left with a dark blue, full-head tattoo that he says left him unable to leave the house.</p>
      <p>He said “It’s been a total nightmare from start to finish. First, I had to deal with the cancer, then I had to get used to my hair loss and to top it off, the terrible tattoo.</p>
      <p>“It has left me really low and depressed. I can’t go anywhere now without a hat and I am conscious of my blue head everywhere I go.</p>

      <p>“I even had to wear a tammy to some of my friends’ funerals. It’s been terrible.”</p>
      <p>And he added: “When someone pointed out her initial on the tattoo I was even more angry. It was like she has branded me.”</p>
      <p>In the past two years, desperate Marcus has spent £1,500 on two specialist wigs to hide the tattoo.</p>
      <p>But earlier this year his luck changed when he met Stevie Barry, boss of Laser Tattoo Removal Scotland, who promised to help.</p>
      <p>Stevie has offered his services for free to try to remove or alter the tattoo and improve Marcus’s quality of life.</p>
      <p>Stevie told us: “When I heard Marcus’ story I knew I had to do something to help. He has been through so much – this is the last thing he needed. The tattoo is one of the worst we’ve ever seen.</p>

      <p>“Laser removal treatments can be pretty painful on the scalp, so we’re trying to treat his tattoo in stages.</p>
      <p>“We’re making a difference to it but it’s going to take a few more sessions.”</p>
      <p>Stevie has put Marcus in touch with award-winning company Skulltec in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Experts there use micro needles to layer pigment dots on a scalp in a process that resembles getting a tattoo.</p>
      <p>The treatment creates the illusion of a full head of shaved hair, similar to multiple tiny tattoos.</p>
      <p>Jen Watkins, who ran Jezebelle Ink, in Armadale, West Lothian, refused to discuss the tattoo when approached by the Daily Record.</p>
      <p>But her husband sent a series of text messages to the paper about the inking.</p>
      <p>He claimed Marcus has not contacted her to complain about his head tattoo and that she has now retired from her job due to ill health.</p>
      <p>He said: “If a client is unhappy with a tattoo they are able to make a claim via the insurance of the shop.</p>
      <p>“Also, when you consent to a tattoo, you give your written acknowledgment that ink can change and discolour and react.</p>
      <p>“And that being the case, all studios are required to have insurance to cover any such eventualities.</p>
      <p>“Jen’s studio had impeccable records from environmental health and from regular inspections. She retired from tattooing due to chronic illness.”</p>
