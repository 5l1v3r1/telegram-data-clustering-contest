      <p>LAUSANNE: The day after Liverpool beat Manchester City in a crunch match where VAR decisions were hotly disputed, the Premier League leader's coach Jurgen Klopp and other top football figures have suggested improvement is needed to the fledgling system.</p>
      <p>Klopp, his City opposite number Pep Guardiola, Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, and Thomas Tuchel of Paris Saint-Germain all attended the UEFA coaches forum in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday (Nov 11), where the VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system was a hot topic.</p>

      <p>"It is clear it's a process where they have to keep on improving," Klopp said.</p>
      <p>"It can be improved, a lot of things have to be done by human beings and we are not 100 per cent (either).</p>
      <p>"There is space for some mistakes, nobody asks for perfection, just to have the right decision, that's all."</p>
      <p>His comments were made a day after the marquee game of the Premier League season so far saw a controversial VAR call after six minutes when City could easily have had a penalty when the ball ricocheted around the Liverpool area and hit the Reds' defender Trent Alexander-Arnold on the arm.</p>
      <p>Not only did VAR fail to overturn the referee's decision not to award City a penalty, but they were doubly punished 22 seconds later when Liverpool midfielder Fabinho fired home a brilliant strike to give the Reds a 1-0 lead.</p>
      <p>UEFA assistant general secretary Giorgio Marchetti said uniformity was needed but called for time for the promising new system to bed in.</p>
      <p>"Now we have VAR, it's quite useful that coaches and representatives of referees can speak together," Marchetti said.</p>
      <p>"Let's not forget VAR is very young and it's a revolution in the game. "What we all need is uniformity.</p>
      <p>"There are points which need to be fine-tuned, but you have to look at the positive points that VAR brings," he said.</p>
