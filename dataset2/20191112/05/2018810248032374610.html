      <p>When YouTuber “Double A” watched Desmond “Etika” Amofah’s final YouTube video, one sentence stuck out to him: “I know this world’s gonna forget me.”</p>
      <p>“That’s just not true,” said Double A, who lives in New York City. “We all miss him. We all love him.” Amofah, a popular 29-year-old YouTuber who created videos about Nintendo games, died by suicide in June of this year. In his final video, he apologised for leaving behind what he called “such a stained legacy.”</p>
      <p>Double A and New York web designer Abe Hunter spearheaded a project meant to give Amofah the legacy they felt he deserved: a stunning mural at 1280 Myrtle Ave. in Bushwick, Brooklyn spanning 40 feet, finished two days ago. Amofah’s smiling face is backgrounded by symbols of his online persona and fandom: Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers for his fans, known collectively as the “Joycon Boyz.” <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> symbols, for one of his favourite games. One of his catchphrases: “Take care of yourself. Have yourself a damn good one!”</p>
      <p>Hunter and Double A both met Amofah at the New York Nintendo store’s Switch launch event in 2017. When Amofah passed, they raised over $US11,000 ($16,048) together for the National Alliance for Mental Illness by selling enamel pins and merchandise on Amofah’s website. Then, Double A suggested establishing a mural to remember Amofah, tapping local mural artist “BKFoxx” and local graffiti artist “kestaadm” to paint it.</p>
      <p>“People are still mourning and not over it,” Hunter told <i>Kotaku</i>. “It’s not a mural to glamorise his death or the negativity. It’s more his life and getting the message out there that we can talk about mental illness. It’s not a taboo subject.”</p>
      <p>The mural was revealed this week, just in time for both Anime NYC and the new <i>Pokemon</i> game, which Hunter says will bring people together to the Nintendo Store in Manhattan. It’s accessible easily from there via the M train, which goes between Manhattan and Bushwick. Since the mural went up, fans have been paying homage to Amofah and posting pictures of themselves alongside the mural on Twitter:</p>

      <p>Yesterday on Twitter, Double A described his first experience alone in front of the mural: “It was raining and I just [burst] out in tears. A car pulls over and people start honking yelling ‘Etika!’ ‘joyconboyz!’ I immediately smiled. This mural brought me some closure, I hope it does the same for you.”</p>
