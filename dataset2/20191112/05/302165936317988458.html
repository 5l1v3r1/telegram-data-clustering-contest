      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 — The higher share prices of plantation counters, namely IOI and KLK, helped push Bursa Malaysia to end mid-day trading higher, although some regional peers experienced a slowdown amid the uncertainty on global markets.</p>
      <p>The local bourse opened slightly higher before turning red due to profit-taking.</p>
      <p>Leading plantation companies IOI Corporation and KLK saw share prices rise by four sen to RM4.44 and 16 sen to RM22.36 respectively.</p>
      <p>At 12.31pm, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KCLI (FBM KLCI) gained 2.83 points to 1,610.98 against Monday’s close of 1,608.15, while moving between 1,605.71 to 1,612.75.</p>
      <p>It opened 4.03 points higher at 1,61218.</p>
      <p>On the broader market, gainers beat losers slightly at 345 to 333, with 388 counters unchanged, 927 untraded and 19 others suspended.</p>
      <p>Turnover amounted to 1.34 billion shares worth RM729.96 million.</p>
      <p>“ The palm oil inventory for October unexpectedly shrank 4.1 per cent month-on-month to 2.3 million metric tonnes, as production started seeing a decline after peaking in September, while exports saw a strong recovery,” Public Investment Bank said in its note today.</p>
      <p>This clearly benefited the shares of plantation companies on Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Public Investment Bank was also optimistic over the outlook for CPO prices and also foresaw exciting fourth quarter 2019 results for plantation companies.</p>
      <p>“We think the 4Q19 results could be one of the strongest quarterly results seen since 2017. Small-mid cap plantation stocks remain our favourite, especially Sarawak Plantation and Ta Ann, as valuations remain attractive at current levels,” it said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on a broader perspective, market players are likely to focus on local key economic data to be released this week, including Bank Negara Malaysia’s third quarter results.</p>
      <p>On the external front, sentiment is still cautious amid uncertainty over the US-China trade talks and the domestic political situation in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>As for heavyweights, Maybank eased seven sen to RM8.78, CIMB slipped four sen to RM5.32, Hong Leong declined 14 sen to RM17.06, while Malaysia Airports was 16 sen lower at RM8.19.</p>
      <p>Of the actives, Sapura Energy and DGB Asia rose half-a-sen yo 29.5 sen and 17.5 sen respectively, Bumi Armada added 1.5 sen to 49.5 sen and AirAsia X was one sen better at 17.5 sen.</p>
      <p>The FBM Emas Index gained 15.90 points to 11,405.89, the FBMT 100 Index advanced 15.66 points to 11,220.67 and the FBM Emas Shariah Index increased 53.18 points to 11,938.45.</p>
      <p>The FBM Ace inched up 1.39 points to 4,886.05 and the FBM 70 was three points better at 14,140.03.</p>
      <p>Sector-wise, the Financial Services Index fell 53.21 points to 15,724.18, but the Industrial Products &amp; Services Index edged up 0.06 of-a-point to 155.51 and the Plantation Index rose 45.32 points to 6,913.52. — Bernama</p>
