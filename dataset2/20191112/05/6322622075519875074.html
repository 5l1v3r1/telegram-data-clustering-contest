      <p>(Nov 12): Hong Kong stocks fluctuated as unrest extended into Tuesday, with protesters gathering in the financial district.</p>
      <p>The Hang Seng Index was up 0.3% as of 1:31 p.m. local time after falling as much as 0.5% earlier in the session. The equity benchmark tumbled 2.6% on Monday, with the city’s shares losing $118 billion in value. Local developers and landlords slipped after starting the session higher. Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. retreated 1.4%, poised for the lowest in nearly a month. The Hong Kong dollar was little changed.</p>
      <p>Monday’s tumble came after a rally in the city’s shares that had added $530 billion amid a liquidity-fueled surge in global equities. The buying momentum was so strong it had sent the Hang Seng gauge into overbought territory for the first time since April.</p>
      <p>Protests have escalated in violence after one student died last week falling from a garage during a police dispersal operation and another was shot by a policeman. Protesters also set a man alight. Monday’s clashes led to about 260 arrests and left nearly 100 people injured.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators filled the city’s financial district at lunch time on Tuesday after disrupting the morning commute for a second straight day, blocking subway lines and clashing with police. - Bloomberg</p>
