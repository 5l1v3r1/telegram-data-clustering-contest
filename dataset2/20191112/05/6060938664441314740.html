      <h1>Viswanathan Anand rues missed chances after third-place finish</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:07:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Prasad-RS-479236858.cms" target="_blank">Prasad RS</a></address>
      <p>CHENNAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/viswanathan-anand">Viswanathan Anand</a> brought all his experience into play on the final day of the Superbet Rapid &amp; Blitz event in Bucharest to finish third on 19.5 points, just 0.5 away from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sergey-Karjakin">Sergey Karjakin</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Levon-Aronian">Levon Aronian</a>. Aronian eventually won the competition beating Karjakin in a playoff.</p>
      <p>While Anand was satisfied with the end-result, the former world champion felt he could have had a shot at the title had he been more consistent in first few days of the tournament. "I had pretty good streaks in the tournament but I was erratic as well. In the rapid section, the game against Mamedyarov Shakhriyar (in round 3) should have been won but I couldn't. It was followed by a loss to (Anton) Korobov and a win against Aronian. Those three games had everything that you can say about an unstable tournament (for me). This continued into the first day of the blitz section as well," Anand told TOI on Monday.</p>
      <p>All Anand hoped for was a strong finish. "I missed many chances to win the title but somehow found myself just half a point behind joint-leaders Karjakin and Aronian (on the final day). Having said that, I squandered a lot of points in the earlier days and that proved to be my undoing," added Anand.</p>
      <p>He may have missed a ticket for next year's Candidates, but Anand doesn't want to sulk over it. "You are disappointed, but you move on. Grand Swiss is a bit of a lottery like all qualification events because you have so many people competing for one or two spots. Not only do you have to play well but things must fall in place as well," Anand said. The event saw Anand cross the 2800 ELO rating in the blitz category.</p>
      <p>Anand will next be seen in action at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Grand-Chess-Tour">Grand Chess Tour</a> in Kolkata later this month. The tournament will see Anand taking on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/magnus-carlsen">Magnus Carlsen</a> for the first time in India since their World championship game here back in 2013. Anand doesn't see the tournament as a match-up between him and Carlsen. "All are tough opponents so I will be thinking of everyone," he said, before adding, "The competition will see the top players in action. It's great to be back in Kolkata as I had done well there last year and I hope to do well (again)."</p>
