      <h1>Ex-Kazakhstan leader proposes Russia-Ukraine presidents meet in bid to ease conflict</h1>

      <p>NUR-SULTAN, Kazakhstan (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's former president Nursultan Nazarbayev is trying to arrange a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose countries are at odds over the war between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"Zelenskiy has already agreed to a tete-a-tete, and (I have) informed the president of Russia about that. We shall see now (if Putin agrees)," Nazarbayev told a conference on international politics in the Kazakh capital Nur-Sultan on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Russia, however, gave a guarded response. Any such meeting must be well prepared and "meeting for the sake of meeting would serve little purpose," the Kremlin said.</p>
      <p>Nazarbayev, who said he was ready to host such a meeting in Kazakhstan, spoke to Putin by telephone on Monday, his office said.</p>
      <p>If the meeting took place, it would represent a breakthrough in ties strained for years by the conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday: "Putin wants the reanimation of relations. But it is impossible to do that without reciprocity from Kiev."</p>
      <p>"Clearly, Putin ...never refuses such meetings, but he believes that meeting for the sake of meeting serves little purpose, it must be well prepared."</p>
      <p>The Kremlin said its current focus was on a potential first summit in three years on the eastern Ukraine conflict between the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>No date for that meeting has been confirmed.</p>
