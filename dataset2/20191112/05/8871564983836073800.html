      <p>Two parties in a long-running dispute were set to hear a ruling this morning at the Chanthaburi Provincial Court this morning when one of them, a retired police officer, opened fire, killing two attorneys in the courtroom.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old gunman, identified as former police officer Tanin Jantarahip, was taken into custody while investigators collect evidence and interview witnesses to the shooting, which happened just after 9am. Tanin reportedly used an automatic pistol to shoot the other party to the case, court workers and lawyers.</p>

      <p>Apart from those killed, attorneys Wijai Sookrom and Bancha Parameesanaporn, three others were shot and injured.</p>
      <p>They included Bancha’s wife, Supaporn Parameesanaporn, another lawyer Wichai Udomthanaphat as well as the gunman himself. All three are reportedly in critical condition. It was unclear whether Tanin was shot in the incident or shot himself.</p>
      <p>The ruling due this morning related to a land-rights dispute the parties had been fighting about for over a decade, according to multiple local media reports.</p>
      <p>Before the incident, both parties had gotten into a verbal argument upon their arrival to the courtroom. That was when Tanin suddenly pulled out a gun and <a href="https://www.posttoday.com/social/local/606095">shot his opponents</a>, according to reports. </p>
