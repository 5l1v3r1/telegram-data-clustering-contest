      <p>“We are very sad to share that today we learned that our baby passed away at 4 months,” Hilaria, who has four children with husband Alec Baldwin, announced on Instagram Monday night.</p>

      <p>Hilaria, 35, said she learned of the miscarriage during a scan on Monday — and the results left her “devastated.”</p>
      <p>Despite the heartache, Hilaria wrote that, “even though we are not ok right now, we will be.”</p>
      <p>A tearful Hilaria posted a video with the announcement alongside the couple’s eldest daughter, 6-year-old Carmen.</p>
