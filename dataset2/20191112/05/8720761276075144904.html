      <p>Microsoft today started <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/12/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-windows-10-november-2019-update/">rolling out the free Windows 10 November 2019 Update</a>. For those keeping track, this update is Windows 10 build 18363 and will bring Windows 10 to version 1909. From a report:<i> The Windows 10 November 2019 Update (version 1909) is odd because it shares the same Cumulative Update packages as the Windows 10 May 2019 Update (version 1903). That means version 1909 will be delivered more quickly to version 1903 users -- it will install like a monthly security update. The build number will barely change: from build 18362 to build 18363. If two computers have the same servicing content, the build revision number should match: 18362.xxx and 18363.xxx. For developers, this means a new Windows SDK will not be issued in conjunction with this version of Windows (there aren't any new APIs).<br/><br/>Again, the Windows 10 November 2019 Update is not a typical release. It's a much smaller update, though it is still worth getting. Windows 10 version 1909 brings improvements to Windows containers, inking latency, and password recovery. User-facing features include letting third-party digital assistants to voice activate above the Lock screen, being able to create events straight from the Calendar flyout on the Taskbar, and displaying OneDrive content in the File Explorer search box. You may also notice some changes to notification management, better performance and reliability on certain CPUs, and battery life and power efficiency improvements.</i></p>
