      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> playback legend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lata-Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a> remains hospitalised here on Tuesday due to 'viral chest congestion', and was fighting the illness like a 'fighter', according to her family.</p>
      <p>The iconic singer was rushed to the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Breach-Candy-Hospital">Breach Candy Hospital</a> in the early hours of Monday due to viral chest congestion as a 'precautionary measure'. Her condition is stable now.</p>
      <p>"Lata ji is stable. Her parameters are good. Honestly speaking, she has fought so well that she is coming out of this setback. Being a singer, her lung capacity has pulled her through. Truly a fighter. We will update everyone when Lataji gets discharged and comes home," her family said.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Lata Mangeshkar's health scare caused a frenzy in the world of social media, where some reports claimed that her condition was critical and some said that she was discharged. Her team had to release a statement to put the record straight.</p>
      <p>"Lata Mangeshkar ji had a viral chest congestion. Keeping her age in mind, as a precautionary measure, she has checked in to Breach Candy Hospital in order to ensure antibiotics on time to prevent any more infection. She is stable and recovering," read the statement.</p>
      <p>The iconic singer, who turned 90 on September 28, became a recipient of India's highest civilian honour Bharat Ratna in 2001. She has recorded songs in over 36 Indian languages.</p>
      <p>Born on September 28, 1929, she has also been honoured with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dadasaheb-Phalke-Award">Dadasaheb Phalke Award</a> and France's highest civilian award, Officer of the Legion of Honour, besides numerous national and international awards.</p>
      <p>In 1974, the Guinness Book of Records ranked her as the most recorded artiste in the history. She had reportedly sung over 25,000 songs between 1948 and 1974.</p>
      <p>She has given many musical gems like 'Pyar kiya to darna kya' and 'Ajeeb dastaan hai yeh', but doesn't consider herself to be special.</p>
      <p>"I never thought of myself as special even when those who have heard and appreciated my singing said I was. For me, the constant effort in life has been to better myself as a person and an artiste," she had said.</p>
