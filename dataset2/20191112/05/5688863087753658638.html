        <b>Australian fast bowler James Pattinson is hopeful of playing consecutive Tests for Australia in their two-match Test series against Pakistan. He had undergone a spinal surgery in 2017 and was back playing for Australia after three years, making two Test appearances in the recently concluded Ashes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Australian speedster James Pattinson played only two Tests in the Ashes series as a part of the workload management for him decided by the team management. But now fit and fresh, he is hopeful of playing back-to-back Tests against Pakistan as the Aussies host them for a two-match Test series. After recovering from a spinal surgery that had taken place due to a back injury that almost threatened to end his career, Pattinson is now back in complete rhythm and high on pace and accuracy and hopes to maintain his fitness and bolster the Australian pace attack with his presence.</p>
      <p>"The next process for me now, if I do get the chance in the Test arena, is to play more back-to-back cricket," Pattinson told Sportstar.</p>
      <p>"I've been injury-free for the best part of a year now. The body is feeling good. Hopefully, that's the next progression, if I do get a chance in the Test team," he further added.</p>
      <p>Pattinson also spoke about the difficulties bowlers face when injuries lead to halting their progress as a bowler. He feels that playing consistent cricket will get him back in full rhythm and will also help the Australian team as the 29-year-old can prove to be a vital weapon for the Test side.</p>
      <p>"You see the batters around and they're playing all the time and they get into a rhythm. As a bowler, it's hard sometimes when you're stopping and going and stopping and going," he asserted.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the next step of the process is playing some consistent cricket," he added.</p>
      <p>Australia have a string of Test assignments coming up with two Tests against Pakistan and three against New Zealand in the next two months. These Test series will test the fitness of Pattinson but will also provide him with the consistency that he needs to get back in rhythm as a bowler. Australian selectors have a good headache as far as the bowling depth is concerned with the likes of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mitchell_starc">Mitchell Starc</a>, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and young sensation Jhye Richardson all in fine shape and form. Although Pattinson seems to be down the pecking order, he is hopeful of creating an impact if an opportunity comes his way and cement his place in the Australian Test team.</p>
      <p>"We've got a lot of fast bowlers up at the moment, which is great for Australian cricket," Pattinson said.</p>
      <p>All anyone can do is go out there and do their best for the team they're playing in," he concluded.</p>
