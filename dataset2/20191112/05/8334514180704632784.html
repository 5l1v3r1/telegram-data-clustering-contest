      <p>public, a senior central bank official said on Tuesday, adding that the goal was to balance privacy concerns and the</p>
      <p>authorities’ need for information.</p>
      <p>China is preparing to be the first country to roll out a digitized domestic currency, a development that is being closely</p>
      <p>watched by the world’s financial services industries, though few details are currently available.</p>
      <p>Akin to Facebook’s proposed Libra digital currency and other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the officially-named Digital Currency Electronic Payment will be powered partially by blockchain technology and dispersed through digital wallets.</p>
      <p>What sets it somewhat apart, however, is that the digital currency’s design seemingly provides Beijing with unprecedented</p>
      <p>oversight over money flows, giving Chinese authorities a degree of control over their economy that most central banks do not have.</p>
      <p>“We know the demand from the general public is to keep anonymity by using paper money and coins ... we will give those</p>
      <p>people who demand it anonymity in their transactions,” Mu Changchun, head of the People’s Bank of China’s digital currency research institute, told a conference in Singapore.</p>
      <p>“But at the same time we will keep the balance between the ‘controllable anonymity’ and anti-money laundering, CTF (counter terrorist financing), and also tax issues, online gambling and any electronic criminal activities,” he added.</p>
      <p>“That is a balance we have to keep, and that is our goal. We are not seeking full control of the information of the general public.”</p>
      <p>It is not clear when the new digital currency will be launched.</p>
      <p>Mu told a public forum in August that it was “almost ready”. However, in September, Chinese central bank chief Yi</p>
      <p>Gang said there was no timetable for its roll out and that it still needed to meet requirements, and again referenced</p>
      <p>anti-money laundering.</p>
      <p>Mu said on Tuesday that the goal of the project was to create a new system in case of problems with China’s existing</p>
      <p>financial infrastructure, where electronic payments are currently dominated by just two players, and to boost financial</p>
      <p>inclusion in rural areas.</p>
