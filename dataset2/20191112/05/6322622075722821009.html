      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): The Institute for Capital Market Research Malaysia (ICMR) has appointed Tan Sri Dr Mohd Munir Abdul Majid as chairman of its board of directors.</p>
      <p>Currently, its board memberscomprise Foo Lee Mei, Professor Mohamed Ariff Syed Mohamed, Datuk Dr Nik Ramlah Mahmood and Dr Nungsari Ahmad Radhi.</p>
      <p>“His (Munir's) deep knowledge of both local and regional economic affairs, wide-ranging experience in leading research institutions, and strong Asean-level networks would further strengthen our institute’s capabilities at a crucial time, given the need for Malaysia’s capital market to improve its competitiveness and functioning to navigate the complexities of the evolving global landscape,” ICMR director Datin Azleen Osman Rani said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>Munir started his career in 1978 as a leader writer for The New Straits TimesPress, and progressed to become its group editor. He left NST in 1986 to become CEO of<br/>Pertanian Baring Sanwa (PBS), whose name he changed to Commerce International Merchant Bankers (CIMB). He was invited by the government to establish and become the first and founding executive chairman of the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) in 1993, where he served for two terms until 1999.</p>
      <p>He also served as chairman on the board of companies including Celcom Malaysia, Malaysian Airline System Bhd, Bank Muamalat Malaysia, CIMB Asean Research Institute, Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia and the Malaysian Chapter of the Asean Business Advisory Council.</p>
      <p>The ICMR also named Professor Datuk Dr Rajah Rasiah, a renowned economist and Distinguished Professor of Economics at the Asia-Europe Institute of University of Malaysia, as the first Distinguished Fellow for the institute’s Distinguished and Visiting Fellows Programme.</p>
      <p>"The programme was established for experts to lend their expertise in areas of research which can benefit the overall capital market development for Malaysia," said ICMR.</p>
      <p>The ICMR is an initiative by the SC, to act as an independent think-tank to promote sustainable development of the Malaysian capital market through providing focused and pragmatic research that can be tapped by industry, policy makers and regulators.</p>
