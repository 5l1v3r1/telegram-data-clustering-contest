      <p><b>Cash-strapped Zimbabweans began using new banknotes and coins Tuesday, as the nation's central bank seeks to ease chronic shortages.</b><br/><br/>The Zimbabwean dollar is being gradually reintroduced, after being rendered worthless by decades of economic mismanagement under former president Robert Mugabe.<br/><br/>That forced the country to rely on US dollars for a decade.<br/><br/>New two- and five-dollar notes were disbursed by the central bank on Monday. <br/><br/>One Zimbabwean dollar is currently worth around six US cents.<br/><br/>"Bond" notes -- a legal tender pegged to the US dollar -- were introduced in 2016 to alleviate chronic cash shortages and ease a transition back to Zimbabwean dollars.<br/><br/>These were then supplemented with electronic RTGS dollars in June 2019.<br/><br/>But cash remains hard to come by, and most people use mobile money and now-banned foreign currencies to pay for goods.<br/><br/>Withdrawals remain capped at a maximum of 300 new Zimbabwean dollars ($18) per week per customer - which buys less than three kilogrammes of beef.<br/><br/>Account holders wait long hours to draw cash.<br/><br/>In Zimbabwe's capital Harare, bank customers remained sceptical.<br/><br/>"There is no difference," Milton Mushangwe, 37, told AFP. "The withdrawal limits remain the same."<br/><br/>"We are still getting the same small amount of 100 dollars or less," added another customer, Richard Govha.<br/><br/>Zimbabwe's reserve bank said that only 31 million new Zimbabwean dollars (less than $2 million) had been disbursed so far, of a planned total of one billion that is to be drip-fed into the system over the next six months.</p>
