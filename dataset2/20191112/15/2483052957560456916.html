      <h1>UCP government admits some critical comments deleted on Kenney Facebook livestream</h1>

      <p>EDMONTON -- The UCP government says it is taking "corrective action" after some Albertans who lobbed criticisms at Premier Jason Kenney on a Facebook livestream had their comments deleted and were blocked from viewing the event.</p>
      <p>At the Manning Centre conference in Red Deer on Saturday, Kenney released details on a new Fair Deal panel that he said will help Alberta become more autonomous from Ottawa.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The speech was livestreamed to Facebook, where some people say dialogue was being restricted to pro-UCP comments only.</p>
      <p>"I was just muted from Jason Kenney's Facebook with my comment deleted for voicing respectfully that I do not wish for him to control our CPP and police force," tweeted Allison Dakin.</p>

      <p>Her tweet generated dozens of replies, many from others who claimed they had similarly been blocked by Kenney and other UCP politicians on Twitter.</p>

      <p>The Premier's Office eventually released a statement singling out Dakin's comments specifically, saying they should not have been moderated and that "corrective action has been taken."</p>
      <p>"Albertans have every right to voice their views to their elected officials, including when they disagree with the Government," the statement said.</p>
      <p>"A review of the thousands of comments on the Premier's Facebook page show a wide swath of opinion, including from those who strongly disagree with the Government."</p>
      <p>The Premier's office said comments with offensive or abusive language may be blocked, but not every comment would be moderated "given the high volume of comments in general."</p>
      <p>Dakin later tweeted that she had been unblocked by Kenney and her comments were restored after she spoke with media.</p>
