      <p>Disney+ is finally here, the brand new streaming service from Disney that showcases all the classic animated films and superhero blockbusters, as well as brand new anticipated content like The Mandalorian. </p>
      <p>The pricing brackets for the streaming service in the US, Canada, The Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand undercut other streaming rivals like Netflix and Amazon Prime by quite a lot.

      <h3>Get free Disney+ with Verizon</h3>
      <p>The best Disney+ offer we've seen so far is for a full free year of the service with one of Verizon's unlimited data plans in the US.</p>
      <p>All new and existing customers on one of <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-discount-3701386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fplans%2Funlimited%2F">Verizon's unlimited 4G or 5G data plans</a> can grab 12 months of Disney+ totally for free, as can any new customers on its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-discount-3701386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fhome%2Ffios%2F">Fios</a> or <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-discount-3701386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2F5g%2Fhome%2F">5G home internet</a> plans - though existing customers on those two services aren't so lucky.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-discount-3701386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsolutions-and-services%2Fdisneyplus%2F">lowest unlimited plans</a> start from $45 per month, but get more expensive depending on the type of plan that you use. The Fios option offers internet for as low as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-discount-3701386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Finhome%2Fbuildproducts">$39.99 with Disney Plus included</a>. The 5G home internet plan is only available in certain areas: see the website for the full list. </p>
      <p>To make things better, Verizon has confirmed that anyone that's pre-purchased Disney+ can still claim the offer - the pre-order subscription will essentially pause for 12 months and kick in once the Verizon offer ends.</p>
      <h3>The Disney Plus bundle</h3>
      <p>If the discount above isn’t feasible for you, then there is another option. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3701386-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-discount-3701386%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney</a> are actually offering a very reasonable bundle that not only gives you access to Disney+, but Hulu and ESPN+ as well for just $12.99 (around £10.70) per month.</p>
      <p>To give you an idea of how much that saves you, we can take a look at how much each service costs alone. Disney+ is $6.99, ESPN+ is $4.99, and Hulu is $5.99 on its cheapest plan. That means at minimum this bundle would make a saving of $5 each month in comparison to having individual subscriptions.</p>
      <p>In terms of content, Hulu streams shows like The Handmaid’s Tale and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/castle-rock-3685201/">Castle Rock</a>, whilst ESPN+ will get you on-demand service for lots of American sports, including MLB, NHL, NBA and MLS games, as well as college sports, PGA golf, Top Rank Boxing, and Grand Slam Tennis matches.</p>
      <p>Please note that both of these deals are <b>only applicable on the US version of Disney+</b> at the moment. However, if you use a VPN, like <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3701386-11-0000000">NordVPN</a>, you may still be able to access these offers and sign up for a US subscription - providing you have access to a US bank account or credit card. VPNs bypass site’s geo-blockers, so you can browse a webpage as if you’re from another country. You can find out more in our article about <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">streaming Disney+ from the UK</a>. </p>
      <p>All you need to do is download you preferred VPN of choice, choose a US server, open a new browser and access the American site that you want. Once you've successfully created an account, you should be able to watch content on the site through a VPN.
