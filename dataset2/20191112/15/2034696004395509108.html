        <b>The musician tackles an existential dilemma on the loungey new number</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/klaxons">Klaxons</a> keyboardist and founding member James Righton has announced his new album ‘The Performer’ and released its title track. Stream the song and find more details below.</p>
      <p>The musician, who’s previously worked on music under his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/klaxons-2-1199660">Shock Machine</a> alias, will release the record on March 20 via Soulwax-run label, DEEWEE. It serves as the first studio effort under his own name.</p>
      <p>Opening with a loungy piano line, the ’70s-inspired first cut from ‘The Performer’ sees Righton question his identity and his role of both an artist and father.</p>

      <p>“Am I this showman up on stage? Or am I the dad changing nappies?” Righton says of the inspiration behind the song. “Am I living in the moment and doing something enjoyable? Or am I fucking miserable? I find that really interesting: this idea of putting on a suit and becoming this other thing.”</p>
      <p>In the accompanying video, the artist dons a classic white suit and performs the song amongst vintage instruments and recording equipment. According to a press release, this aesthetic will form the basis of Righton’s upcoming live shows – due to be announced soon.</p>
      <p>‘The Performer’ was produced by Righton himself and features contributions from James Ford (Arctic Monkeys/The Last Shadow Puppets), who played drums on the LP.</p>
