      <p>Turkish officials are performing a post-mortem examination and other procedures as they try to establish how a former British Army officer who helped found the White Helmets volunteer aid group in Syria died.</p>
      <p>James Le Mesurier’s body was found near his home in Istanbul early on Monday by worshippers on their way to morning prayers.</p>
      <p>Turkish police believe he fell to his death from his home and are investigating the circumstances. Last week a leading Russian official had claimed he was a spy, something Britain strongly denies.</p>

      <p>The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said a post-mortem and other procedures were under way at the Forensic Medicine Institute to determine “the exact cause” of his death.</p>
      <p>It said police were still in the process of gathering security camera recordings near the scene and assessing them.</p>
      <p>Istanbul governor Ali Yerlikaya told reporters: “Our chief prosecutor’s office, our police are engaged in multifaceted efforts to shed light on the incident.”</p>

      <p>Mr Le Mesurier was the founder and chief executive of May Day Rescue, which established and trained the White Helmets, also known as the Syria Civil Defence, a group of local humanitarian volunteers.</p>
      <p>The group, which has had more than 3,000 volunteers in opposition-held areas, says it has saved thousands of lives since 2013 and documented Syrian government attacks on civilians and other infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The group has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

      <p>Last week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Mr Le Mesurier of being a former British agent working in the Balkans and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>She alleged he had “been spotted all around the world, including in the Balkans and the Middle East”.</p>
      <p>Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to the UN, denied those allegations, saying: “The Russian charges against him, that came out of Foreign Ministry that he was a spy, are categorically untrue.”</p>
      <p>She also said Britain would be “looking very closely” at the Turkish authorities’ investigation.</p>
      <p>Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported that he was 48 and had moved to Turkey with his wife four years ago.</p>
