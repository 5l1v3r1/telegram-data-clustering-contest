      <p>Best Buy is currently selling the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">PowerBeats Pro</a> for just $149, that's good for their lowest price ever. However, these are for certified refurbished PowerBeats Pro.</p>
      <p>The PowerBeats Pro is the company's first pair of truly wireless headphones, and they are actually pretty good. Coming in at a regular price of $249 though, they are $100 off today. Actually making them a bit more affordable than they previously were.</p>
      <p>With the PowerBeats Pro you're going to be able to listen to music on the go, and at the gym. These are sweatproof, as all headphones should be. So you can wear these while you're at the gym, getting your workout in. And not worry about sweating through them and damaging them.</p>

      <p>You're also going to get some of the best battery life out of the PowerBeats Pro. We're looking at around nine hours on a single charge. That is pretty good, for a pair of truly wireless headphones. Considering most are sitting at around four or five hours of continuous playback. Now with the carrying case, that will get you about 24 hours of playback. So it can charge them about three times.</p>
      <p>The PowerBeats Pro are a really great pair of headphones, though they are pretty large, unfortunately. So they might not be for everyone. But the music quality here is pretty amazing. We're looking at some deep bass, though not overpowering like some older Beats products used to be. The mids and highs are also pretty crisp and clear, which is great.</p>
      <p>These are some great truly wireless headphones, and even though these are certified refurbished, they still come with a geek squad warranty, so you'll be covered if something did go wrong.</p>
