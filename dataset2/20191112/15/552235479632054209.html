      <h1>Threave Rovers Youth Development £11,000 better off thanks to Cash for Kids</h1>
      <h2>A month of fund raising in the West Sound Radio competition has provided a fantastic boost for club funds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:46:07+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>Threave Rovers Youth Development is in the money by more than £11,000 after a month of fundraising.</p>
      <p>The club was one of six from across Dumfries and Galloway to take part in a West Sound Cash for Kids competition to raise as much money as possible.</p>
      <p>The youngsters raised nearly £9,000 – and as that was the most of any of the clubs they were awarded an extra £2,500.</p>
      <p>It was the second year running the competition had been held, with Threave also winning last year.</p>
      <p>Chairman Mark Geddes said: “We laughed that we’d try to beat last year’s target and we did! It was an intensive four weeks but it was worth it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We had a pop-up shop in Castle Douglas as well as various fundraising nights. The kids were given £1 to grow into business ideas. A few of the players are at Hardgate Primary so they worked together and some held bake sales.</p>
      <p>“One lad used his pound to write to all of the Scottish Premiership Clubs. Livingston donated the match ball from their win over Celtic which was raffled for more than £600.</p>
      <p>“He also got a matchday experience from Aberdeen which was raffled for £120. We got lots of other things donated which we raffled.”</p>
      <p>That helped raise a final total of £8,998, which the youth system – run separately from the adult team – keeps along with the extra £2,500 from West Sound.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And the plan is for the money to go towards an ambitious project for an indoor football facility in Castle Douglas.</p>
      <p>Mark said: “The football facilities in Castle Douglas are fairly limited. We have Birkland in the town but there is extremely poor drainage in the winter so my idea has been to build an indoor facility which could be used during the winter.</p>
      <p>“We pay a lot for facility hire and the first team trains away from Castle Douglas which doesn’t make any sense.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">“Dalbeattie and Kirkcudbright have a 3G pitch but we don’t have that here, meaning the team I coach trains at Dalbeattie.”</a>
