      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:51:33+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Rudd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-rudd/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City star Raheem Sterling warned Liverpool player Joe Gomez 'don't f**k with me' during their heated exchange in Sunday's Premier League game, Mirror.co.uk can reveal.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed towards the end of City's 3-1 Anfield loss to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Professional lipreader Tina Lannin of 121 Captions has reviewed the footage and told Mirror.co.uk what the players said to each other.</p>
      <p>As Raheem is pushed by Gomez he walks straight back into Gomez and says: "Don’t f**k with me, Joe. Don’t f**k with me.”</p>
      <p>Gomez responds by saying "come on!" before he's pulled away by fellow Liverpool players.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed again 24 hours later, in the canteen at England’s St George’s Park training base which led to Gareth Southgate axing Sterling.</p>

      <p>Liverpool defender Gomez was later seen sporting a scratch below his right eye while training.</p>
      <p>Southgate said today at a press conference that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Sterling</a> lost control of his emotions and as a result will not be included in the Three Lions squad to face Montenegro in the Euro 2020 qualifier on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't normally speak at this stage but it is important to speak publicly about this," said Southgate at his press conference. "I am dealing with a very young squad and we are in a sport where emotions run high.</p>
      <p>"We are a team. I understand our profile and the insatiable interest in our camp which we have to be aware of. That's the reality of why things become public which would not happen at a club.</p>

      <p>"Raheem explained last night that for a brief moment his emotions ran over. It would be correct to say that's not the same for Joe [Gomez].</p>
      <p>"These things happen in football. We have some excellent senior players who have played a part in bringing everybody together.”</p>
      <p>On the decision entering the public domain, Southgate added: “When you’ve made a decision like that it’s going to be public on Wednesday or Thursday anyway and I’d rather deal with it now than on the day of the game.”</p>
      <p>However, the Three Lions chief was remaining tight-lipped over exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>“I’m not prepared to go into detail," he continued. "There is enough conjecture and opinion and talk out there, [and] we don’t need to add to that.</p>

      <p>“I’ve said what I think needs to be said but we have to keep as much as we can between ourselves.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether he would have treated all players in a similar manner and asked to expand on his decision-making process Southgate continued: “It’s important to be as fair as possible on any decision I make, whether that’s a senior player or a junior player.</p>
      <p>“The decision has been made not to consider Raheem for the game on Thursday and that’s the end of the matter for me.</p>
      <p>"The priority for me is to keep the group together if possible and as emotions calmed yesterday, that was clearly a possibility. I’m very impressed with the players, the way they worked it through collectively.</p>
      <p>"In the end I’m the manager and I’ve made a decision that I think was appropriate for how we want to move forward.</p>

      <p>"I consult very closely with all of the players and in particular my senior players and they have a very good understanding of the way we’ve worked over the last couple of years, that has brought us a lot of togetherness, which is still there.</p>
      <p>"Now we have to turn our attention to the football. We’ve got a hugely important qualifier to qualify for a European Championships.</p>
      <p>"I love all of my players, we’re like a family and all families have disagreements. The most important thing is you communicate through those disagreements.</p>
      <p>"I don’t expect, as a manager, to never have to deal with things that are difficult or unexpected. That’s part and parcel of the job.</p>
      <p>“In my view, the group are moving forward. There seems to be all sorts of information being passed form all different areas.</p>
      <p>“Team getting out, information getting out, there seems to be so much information in the background.</p>
      <p>“Every player has had an opportunity to speak to me if they want to, and my view is that the group is ready to move forwards.”</p>
