      <p>KABUL: Afghanistan will release two senior Taliban commanders and a leader of the Haqqani militant group in exchange for an American and an Australian professor who were kidnapped in 2016, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Tuesday (Nov 12).</p>
      <p>The government's decision to free Anas Haqqani and two other Taliban commanders in a prisoner swap was taken in the hope of securing direct talks with the Taliban, which has hitherto refused to engage with what it calls an illegitimate "puppet" regime in Kabul.</p>

      <p>"In order to pave the way for a face-to-face negotiations with the Taliban, the government has decided to free Taliban prisoners in exchange for two university professors," Ghani said in a televised speech.</p>
      <p>Ghani said Anas Haqqani and Taliban commanders Haji Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid were being released. All three were captured in 2014.</p>
      <p>The prisoner exchange comes at a time when efforts were being made to revamp peace talks between the United States and the Taliban.</p>
      <p>The Haqqani network has in recent years carried large-scale militant attack on civilians. It is believed to be based in Pakistan and is part of the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Anas Haqqani is the younger brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is second-in-command in the Afghan Taliban hierarchy and leads the Haqqani network, considered to the deadliest faction of the Afghan Taliban.</p>
      <p>A Taliban spokesman earlier this year said that the movement was determined to obtain Anas Haqqani's release and named him as a member of a negotiating team that would hold talks with US officials.</p>
      <p>The Taliban had kidnapped US citizen Kevin King and an Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors, in August 2016 from the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul.</p>
      <p>Ghani said authorities had been unable to discover where the Taliban were holding the two captive.</p>
      <p>"Information suggests that their health while being held by the terrorists has deteriorated," he said.</p>
      <p>Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan during a three-day visit to Washington in July that he would do his best to help release the American University professors.</p>
      <p>A Pakistani delegation, including the chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency was in Kabul to meet Afghan authorities on Monday. A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the exchange of prisoners was discussed by the delegation.</p>
      <p>According to Afghan officials, the next round of talks between the Taliban and Afghan representatives is slated for this month in Beijing.</p>
