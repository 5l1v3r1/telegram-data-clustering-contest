      <p>Cain and Aaron Dingle are facing trouble at the hands of gangster Sean in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>.</p>
      <p>But eagle-eyed fans may recognise the actor who plays Sean from his short, but important, stint in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street.</a></p>

      <p>Gavin Rodwell was the son of Les Dennis's character, Michael Rodwell, whose identity was stolen by Andy Carver.</p>
      <p>Andy pretended to be Gavin, but when the real Gavin showed up, Andy was in too deep so tried to pay him to leave.</p>
      <p>Gavin was then killed in a car accident after he suffered a heart attack while driving.</p>

      <p>Sean, part of the gang whose cars they stole, has already made threats against Cain, and it looks like he's not afraid to act on them when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-moses-kidnapped-charity-panic/">he kidnaps Moses</a>!</p>
      <p>As Aaron and Cain face the choice of returning the cars in exchange for Moses or the child getting hurt, can they get him back?</p>
