      <h1>Texas Family Told It’s Too Early to Have Christmas Decorations Up</h1>

      <p>I actually agree, but it looks like this family may have to take them down.</p>
      <p>This is actually why you don't live in a community that has a homeowners association. They control everything that you do on your property. No way I would ever live in one, but it looks like over in San Antonio one family is going to fight this uphill battle.</p>

      <p>Looks like Nick and Claudia Simonis love to decorate for Christmas, in fact they put up their decorations on November 1st. A little early in my opinion, but it's not my house so do what you want. Looks like on November 4th, they received a letter from their homeowners association. “Maintenance – Holiday Decorations Need To Be Removed,” <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/too-soon-festive-family-told-to-take-down-christmas-decorations">the notice read. </a>Under a section labeled "inspector notes," DAMC asked the family to "please remove the snowman until closer to the holiday season."</p>
      <p>So the family is asking, what is closer to the holiday season? The letter didn't have a date for when decorations would be allowed. Nick and Claudia Simonis say they will not be taking them down and some of their neighbors have actually joined in and started decorating early.</p>
      <p>Their homeowners association does have a policy of taking down decorations within ten days after a holiday, but nothing on early decorating. We will see if this family wins, or if they get fined for keeping them up. Just another reason to never live in a homeowners association neighborhood.</p>
