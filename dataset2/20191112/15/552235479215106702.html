      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-warns-nigel-farage-20862227">First Minister Nicola Sturgeon</a> supports having two referendums next year on independence and Brexit.</p>
      <p>The SNP leader confirmed her support for another vote on the UK’s relationship with the EU, even though it could come months before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-insists-snp-cast-20840856">indyref2</a> .</p>
      <p>Her party at Westminster has voted for a confirmatory vote on Brexit as a way of giving people the final say on any deal.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-vow-keep-trumps-hands-20834773">SNP’s</a> general election campaign has primarily focused on giving Scots the chance to escape Brexit via a second independence referendum in 2020.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he wants a second Brexit referendum within six months of him entering Downing street - leading to a potential clash of dates.</p>
      <p>Asked at an event in Edinburgh today if it was possible there could be two referenda in 2020 - on Brexit and independence - Sturgeon replied: <b><br/></b>“The one on Brexit, that’s not my decision alone, we would support it. Obviously I am focused on securing an independence referendum next year. The UK is in a mess, it’s got to [get] its way out of that mess, and Scotland has the right to choose its own future.”</p>
      <p>Pressed on whether she supports a second Brexit referendum next year, she said: “Yes.”</p>
