      <p>LONDON, Nov 12 — Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has been withdrawn from the Scotland squad ahead of their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan due to an ankle problem.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old initially suffered the injury in United’s 3-0 Europa League victory over Partizan Belgrade last Thursday and aggravated the problem in the 3-1 Premier League win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on Sunday.</p>
      <p>United did not say when McTominay, who has featured in all 12 league games this season, would return but confirmed https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/scott-mctominay-withdraws-from-scotland-squad he would miss Scotland’s trip to Cyprus on Thursday and their home clash against Kazakhstan next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Liverpool defender Andy Robertson, who played the full 90 minutes of Sunday’s 3-1 victory over Premier League champions Manchester City, was also withdrawn along with Bournemouth’s Ryan Fraser and Leeds United’s Liam Cooper due to injury.</p>
      <p>Scotland did not provide any details of their injuries, with manager Steve Clarke calling up midfielders Lewis Morgan and Graeme Shinnie to the squad as replacements.</p>
      <p>Scotland are fourth in Group I with nine points from eight matches and cannot finish in the first or second qualifying places for the European Championships.</p>
      <p>However, they can progress to their first major tournament since 1998 via the Nations League playoffs, which take place in March next year. — Reuters</p>
