      <p>LONDON, Nov 12 — Roger Federer kept alive his hopes of a seventh ATP Finals crown on today, beating Italian debutant Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 at London’s O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>The Swiss third seed put himself under enormous pressure by losing his first match on Sunday in straight sets in Group Bjorn Borg to Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>The six-time champion was not at his fluent best today but ultimately had too much for Berrettini, who won just three games against Novak Djokovic in his opener.</p>
      <p>Both players were solid on serve in the first set, with Federer struggling to make inroads against the eighth seed.</p>
      <p>The Swiss eventually earned himself the sniff of a chance in the 12th game, winning the first break point of the match but Berrettini snuffed out the danger and held to take it into a tie-break.</p>
      <p>Federer upped the level of his game in the shootout, helped by some wayward shots from his opponent plus a Berrettini double-fault and won it comfortably 7-2.</p>
      <p>The Swiss, clad in black, broke immediately at the start of the second to leave the Italian with a mountain to climb.</p>
      <p>Berrettini earned a clutch of break points in the eighth game but Federer eventually served himself out of trouble, sealing the game with an ace.</p>
      <p>Djokovic and Thiem hope to take a major step towards qualifying for the semi-finals when they meet in the evening match at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>Djokovic is hunting a sixth ATP Finals title to pull level with Federer’s record and is also seeking to pip Rafael Nadal to the year-end number one ranking.</p>
      <p>Yesterday top seed Nadal lost his opener in Group Andre Agassi to defending champion Alexander Zverev while Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Daniil Medvedev.</p>
