      <p>Nintendo has revealed that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate"><b>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</b></a> will soon be updated to Version 6.1.0, just days after <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/super_smash_bros_ultimate_version_6_0_is_now_live_here_are_the_full_patch_notes">the big Version 6.0 update</a> that was implemented last week.</p>
      <p>The news comes from an in-game announcement warning players of the upcoming update - you'll see it next time you turn on the game. There's no news just yet on what changes will be made, but we wouldn't be surprised to see tweaks to new character <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/terry_bogard_is_available_in_super_smash_bros_ultimate_right_now">Terry Bogard</a> as the development team begin to understand his strengths and weaknesses in the hands of players.</p>
      <p>As is usually the case, the warning comes with the following message, urging players to convert any saved replays before the update:</p>
      <blockquote>"Software update Ver. 6.1.0 will be available within the next few days. Please be aware that after this update, you will not be able to view replays saved prior to this version, unless you convert the replays to video via Vault → Replays → Replay Data → Convert to Video. More details on update content will be provided on release."</blockquote>
