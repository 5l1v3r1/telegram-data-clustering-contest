      <p>'Tis the season for all things Christmas and the season for the big supermarket chains to release their eagerly-awaited, festive-themed adverts.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's is the latest to launch its Christmas ad, and the supermarket has gone for a decidedly Dickensian feel.</p>
      <p>But it hasn't impressed viewers, with some calling it 'scary' and 'dreary'.</p>

      <p>The supermarket is celebrating its 150th birthday this year and has made its Christmas advert into a festive fable set in 1869.</p>
      <p>It tells the story of a young orphan chimney sweep - Nicholas - who is caught picking up an orange from outside the very first Sainsbury's store.</p>

      <p>Wrongly accused of stealing the orange, he's banished into the snowy wilderness.</p>
      <p>But wait! He's soon rescued by Mary Ann Sainsbury, who gives him a big bag of oranges and tells the mite: "If you can’t do something special for someone at Christmas, then when can you?"</p>

      <p>Nicholas then goes back into the town and leaves an orange in each of his fellow orphans' stockings.</p>
      <aside>If you can’t do something special for someone at Christmas, then when can you?</aside>
      <p>We then see him pull over a red cloak and red hat, implying that Nicholas and Father Christmas are one and the same.</p>
      <p>Although the advert has fantastic production values and tells a wholesome story, not everyone was touched by it.</p>
      <p>Many took to Twitter to voice their displeasure.</p>

      <p>One viewer wrote: "What a dreary @sainsburys advert this is."</p>
      <p>"That's actually quite scary for children," another said.</p>
      <p>"I'm actually quite taken aback."</p>
