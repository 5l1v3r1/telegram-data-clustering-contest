      <h2>A cyclist who was asked to move after lying across four priority train seats on a busy service told staff to 'f*** off' before going back to sleep</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:12:41+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A cyclist who lay down across four priority seats on a train refused to move after telling the train manager to 'get f***ed'.</p>
      <p>Fellow passenger Stuart Dawson boarded a 7.18am train into central Auckland last week when he found a cyclist lying down to have a sleep on the 'packed' service.</p>
      <p>At the next station a mum with her baby and a pram got on to find they had nowhere to sit and Stuart managed to get the attention of the train manager to point out the ridiculous situation.</p>
      <p>When the member of staff asked the cyclist to move, he became aggressive and hurled abuse.</p>

      <p>Stuart said: "He went up and asked the cyclist to move and the guy just said 'get f****d'. He said that a couple of times," as reported by the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12283150">New Zealand Herald</a> .</p>
      <p>"The manager then said, 'if you continue doing that I'll let you off at the next stop'.</p>
      <p>"The cyclist repeated what he said, saying 'f*** off' and went back to sleep. The manager then walked off and did absolutely nothing."</p>
      <p>Dawson said there was no other space for the mum and her baby to get a seat without their pram blocking other passengers and the train manager approached her to make sure she was okay.</p>
      <p>He added he usually sees the mum on the same morning train as him but hasn't seen her since the incident, believing she may have been put off catching that particular service.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Transdev, which manages the train, said this type of behaviour was uncommon and they take 'every precaution to ensure the safety of its passengers'.</p>
      <p>They added on-board staff have been trained to call the police when necessary and were pleased the member of staff had checked on the woman.</p>
      <p>Last month, a mum-of-three slammed an elderly couple who she claims <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mum-slams-elderly-couple-who-20703478">refused to give up the train seats</a> she had reserved for her family.</p>
      <p>Amanda Mancino-Williams says the pair told her it 'didn't matter' when she pointed out to the pair the seats had been pre-booked.</p>
      <p>The mum and her children had the last laugh however as all four were upgraded to an empty table in first class.</p>
