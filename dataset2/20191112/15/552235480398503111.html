      <p>Part of the A77 will close again for major roadworks.</p>
      <p>The refurbishment work at Stumpy Corner will conclude with a 0.5km resurfacing of the A77 through Girvan.</p>
      <p>Scotland TranServ will deliver two resurfacing projects under a single weekend closure and two additional overnight closures of the carriageway.</p>
      <p>The works will begin on Friday, November 22 with completion scheduled for Wednesday, November 27 and resurfacing is between Henrietta Street and Old Street Garage.</p>
      <p>Alan Murray, Scotland TranServ’s Principal Road Design Engineer, said: “It is necessary to close the trunk road through the town for the duration of the weekend, and we would like to thank drivers in advance for their patience. Shops and other businesses will remain open for pedestrian access, with parking maintained either end of the closure.”</p>
      <p>Over the last few weeks, Scotland TranServ’s Strategic Road Safety team has been delivering improvements in the area. The team has installed new traffic signals and footways, with the resurfacing programme the conclusion of this work.</p>
      <p>In order to complete this programme the road will be closed at 8pm Friday, November 22 till 6am on the Monday. It will then close again at 8pm on Monday till 6am Tuesday before concluding between 8pm Tuesday and 6am Wednesday, November 27.</p>
      <p>Drivers are advised to allow additional time for their journeys and local diversions will be in place.</p>
