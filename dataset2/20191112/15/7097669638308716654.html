In the first significant snow of the season, a wintry mix swept into northern New England, with hundreds of schools closed or delayed in Vermont due to snow, and slick conditions in New Hampshire and Maine.

      <p>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) â€” The Latest on winter weather (all times local):</p>
      <p>10:25 a.m.</p>
      <p>Snow and icy conditions are snarling traffic and closing or delaying schools in parts of the Northeast and South.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service says the snow total had surpassed 10 inches (25 centimeters) at the Buffalo airport on Tuesday morning. Rochester will eventually be digging out from a similar amount. Northern New England was expected to get between 7 inches and 14 inches (18 centimeters to 36 centimeters) of snow.</p>
      <p>Numerous vehicle accidents were reported, as well as school closings and delays in western New York.</p>
      <p>The South also felt the chill with light snow blanketing cars in Memphis, Tennessee. Warming centers opened in the city, where temperatures fell into the low 20s.</p>
      <p>Some West Tennessee schools were closed, and about 20 school systems delayed opening across north Alabama.</p>

      <p>Much of the snow that was supposed to fall in the Midwest has come down and now it's time for the main event: Record-breaking cold.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service says Tuesday and Wednesday may see record cold from the southern Plains to the Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes and beyond, thanks to what it calls an "arctic airmass." Meteorologist Kevin Birk says the high temperature in Chicago is expected to reach 21 degrees (-6 Celsius), seven degrees lower than the previous record for Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>Monday's weather made driving difficult in much of the Midwest. Authorities said the icy road conditions were to blame for the deaths of three adults in Michigan and an 8-year-old girl in Kansas.</p>
      <p>In Chicago, a plane landing at O'Hare International Airport on Monday slid across the runway. No one was injured.</p>
