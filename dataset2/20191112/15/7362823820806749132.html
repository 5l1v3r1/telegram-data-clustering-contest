      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> authorities located a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons">missing woman</a> and her two children after a "frantic" phone call made near a Walmart late Monday night that sent cops scrambling and ultimately resulted in the arrest of her father-in-law, according to officials.</p>
      <p>Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">State Police</a> said Tuesday in a news release that 31-year-old Alicia Brumbaugh and her two children -- Maverick Lee Brumbaugh, 1, and Aleah Nicole Rose Brumbaugh, 2 -- were last seen around 4 a.m. in their hometown of Imler, located about 27 miles south of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast">Altoona</a>.</p>
      <p>Officials said they believed the trio had been traveling with Alicia Brumbaugh's father-in-law, 56-year-old Edgar Lee Decker, Jr. of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">Roaring Spring, Pa.</a>, who had an active felony warrant and was recently released from rehab.</p>
      <p>State police said Brumbaugh “made a frantic phone call” just after 11:20 p.m. from or near the parking lot of the Walmart in Indiana, Pa., roughly a 60-mile drive from her hometown.</p>
