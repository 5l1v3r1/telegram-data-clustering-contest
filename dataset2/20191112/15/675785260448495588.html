      <h1>Instagram copies TikTok with new 'Reels' feature - here's how it works</h1>
      <h2>Instagram's new feature, called Reels, lets you create 15-second video clips set to audio or music, and share them with your followers via your Story</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:43:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>They’re two of the biggest rivals in the social media industry, and now it seems that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> has taken a leaf out of TikTok’s book with the launch of its latest feature.</p>
      <p>The feature, called Reels, lets users create 15-second video clips set to music, and share them on their Stories.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/instagram-reels/">TechCrunch</a> , who first reported the new feature, users can access a huge catalogue of music to soundtrack their Reels, or borrow audio from another video.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Instagram has been fairly open about the fact that it copied the feature from TikTok.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/instagram-reels/">TechCrunch</a> , Robby Stein, Instagram’s director of product management, said: “I think Musically before TikTok, and TikTok deserve a ton of credit for popularising this format.</p>

      <p>“No two products are exactly the same, and at the end of the day sharing video with music is a pretty universal idea we think everyone might be interested in using. The focus has been on how to make this a unique format for us.”</p>
      <p>Reels can be found in the Instagram Stories shutter modes tray, alongside the Boomerang and Super-Zoom options.</p>
      <p>Users can choose whether to record a video with no audio, to borrow audio from another audio, or to add a popular song to their recording.</p>

      <p>And unlike standard videos on Stories, users can record or upload multiple video clips to fill out their Reel.</p>
      <p>Initially, the feature is only available for Instagram users in Brazil, where it’s called Cenas.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear when, or if, it will launch for users around the world. Mirror Online has contacted Instagram for comment.</p>
