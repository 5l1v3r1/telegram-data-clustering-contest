      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers attacked Britain’s opposition Labour Party for a second time in two days on Tuesday and attempted to force its web services offline, according to a person with knowledge of the matter and documents seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>The attack began at around 1320 GMT and peaked about an hour later, the source said, just hours after the Labour Party announced it had repelled a similar attack on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>A Labour Party spokesman had no immediate comment.</p>
      <p>The source said both attacks were “very unsophisticated” distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks which try to take down target websites by flooding them with malicious traffic.</p>
