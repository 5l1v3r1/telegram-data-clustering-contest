      <h2>Loveholidays has apologised after Mark Mould and his family, of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, paid £3,465 for the break at Crystal Beach Aqua Park and Hotel in Hurghada, Egypt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:27:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Charlotte Penketh-King, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A family who spent more than £3,400 for their dream <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/">holiday</a> arrived to find the hotel was in fact a pile of rubble.</p>
      <p>Mark Mould, 33, booked the trip through travel company loveholidays - a two-week break to Crystal Beach Aqua Park and Hotel in Hurghada, Egypt with family and friends.</p>
      <p>But when the group of five landed in Egypt, they were shocked to discover the all inclusive paradise they had been promised never existed.</p>
      <p>They were taken instead to the next-door hotel, which they discovered was in the process of being demolished.</p>
      <p>They were transferred by loveholidays to a second hotel, which took an £8,000 "holding deposit" from the upset group from Gainsborough, Lincolnshire.</p>
      <p>"It was a rollercoaster of disaster, tears and sickness.</p>

      <p>"I think we all felt wholeheartedly that we had been sold an expensive dream and been served a crumbling nightmare," Mark, an industrial electrician, said.</p>
      <p>"It was fraud on a grand scale from a large company, who clearly has no morals.</p>
      <p>"As you can appreciate, it was a frustrating time and potentially they could have left us stranded on three occasions due the lack of care and diligence shown to their customers."</p>
      <p>Mark and his wife Sarah, 50, were joined by Sarah's best friend Natalie Barnes, 40, and her kids Kyziah, 15 and 13-year-old Ty.</p>
      <p>They landed in the country on August 7 in the hope to reach Crystal Beach Aqua Park and Hotel, supposedly a five-star resort in Hurghada, Egypt.</p>

      <p>They later found the hotel never existed - an old hotel, Al Mas Palace Hotel &amp; Beach Resort, had been closed since 2017 and the building had been bought with the plan of turning it into the Crystal Beach Aqua Park and Hotel.</p>
      <p>But the new hotel had never been finished and was still listed on loveholidays' website.</p>
      <p>The standard of the alternative accommodation was shoddy, Mark claimed.</p>
      <p>Photos show broken furniture and dirty floors.</p>

      <p>The electrician continued: "We were shown to our rooms which had ripped sheets and poo stained floors and bathrooms that flooded if you tried to shower.</p>
      <p>"It was now late so we sacked the rooms off after making our first complaint regarding the sleeping arrangements and lack of a beds - one adult and two kids of different genders were given two small doubles to share, not ideal.</p>
      <p>"We went for a warm beer in a non air conditioned bar to pass the time until we could examine the beautiful outside that we had been promised.</p>
      <p>"The bar was abysmal with ceiling tiles falling down, the sofas ripped and tattered curtains torn and falling from the walls.</p>
      <p>"The food was sub-standard, they constantly ran out of alcohol or just didn't have it, and the lifeguards couldn't swim or had left because they hadn't been paid and were replaced by gardeners.</p>

      <p>"There was no air con, the internal areas were in a derelict state and many of the services were not available due to the hotel being 'closed down'."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for lovelolidays said: "We apologise to Mr Mould and his group for the issues that they experienced on their holiday to Egypt in August.</p>
      <p>"We have undertaken a thorough investigation internally and with the hotel supplier concerned.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, we were let down in this instance by the hotel supplier which insisted that the original hotel would be ready to accept guests which was clearly not the case.</p>

        <figcaption>The state of the alternative accommodation has also been criticised (Image: Mark Mould / SWNS)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"We recognise that alternative accommodation was not resolved as quickly as it should have been for these guests and acknowledge that a number of errors occurred which resulted in further issues for Mr Mould and his party.</p>
      <p>"loveholidays has reached a final settlement with Mr Mould for the costs and inconvenience caused to him and his party. We set ourselves high standards for customers experience.</p>
      <p>"We acknowledge that Mr Mould’s experience fell short of these high standards and we will learn from this experience to seek to avoid any repeat of this scenario for our customers in the future.”</p>
      <p>The hotel has since been taken down from loveholidays' website but can still be booked through various other holiday providers online.</p>
