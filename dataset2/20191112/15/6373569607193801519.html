      <p>A Question Of Sport Live is the hit show's first live stage tour in nine years and stars host Sue Barker and resident team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell, along with big-name guests from across the sporting world.</p>
      <p>The unmissable stage show is the perfect way for fans to see the show up close in a thrilling live environment as it follows the small-screen format featuring many of the rounds and challenges fans of the hit show know and love.</p>
      <p>Audience members will be able to participate by directly posing questions to the teams and getting involved in some rounds.</p>

      <p>Sue Barker said: “2020 is a landmark year for A Question of Sport. It's the show's 50th anniversary and I can’t think of a better way to celebrate this Golden Anniversary than to take the show around the country. We had such a brilliant time on the last tour so I can’t wait to do it again.”</p>
      <p>Phil Tufnell added: “The live shows are something really special. It’s a thrill to be able to take  A Question of Sport  from people’s living rooms into arenas and theatres across the UK. The interaction with the crowd is brilliant and it’s always a really exciting, hilarious and fun night out.”</p>
      <p>And Matt Dawson said: “I was a fan of A Question of Sport long before I joined the show so it’s an honour for me to be part of these 50th anniversary celebrations.</p>
      <p>"I’m really looking forward to going out on the road again – it’s been too long.</p>
      <p>"The live shows are different each night and everyone involved, whether they are on stage or in audience, has an absolute ball. We all love it and can’t wait to get started.”</p>
