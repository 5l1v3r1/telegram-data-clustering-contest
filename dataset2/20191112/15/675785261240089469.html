      <p>The Labour Party has been hit by the second cyber attack in the space of 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Hackers attempted to force the party's web services offline at around 1.20pm today, a source told Reuters.</p>
      <p>It happened just hours after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> revealed a first attack had happened yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Party sources have confirmed the latest incident.</p>
      <p>The source said both attacks were "very unsophisticated" distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks which try to take down target websites by flooding them with malicious traffic.</p>
