      <p>Speaking to <i><a href="https://www.etonline.com/mark-ruffalo-reveals-his-dream-she-hulk-casting-exclusive-136062">Entertainment Tonight</a></i>, the <i>Hulk</i> actor put his money behind Thompson to bag the lead role in the forthcoming <i>She-Hulk</i>.</p>
      <p>“I mean, Tessa Thompson’s already Valkyrie but she’d be a great She-Hulk,” Ruffalo said of the actress who he’s worked with on both 2017’s <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> and this year’s <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>

      <p>Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson, is Marvel’s first LGBTQ character</p>
      <p>Thompson made history in 2017 when her character in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/thor-ragnarok-film-review"><i>Thor: Ragnarok</i></a> became Marvel’s first LGBTQ character.</p>
      <p>She’s since stated that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/marvel-going-make-female-ensemble-movie-2243538">she’d love to be part of a prospective all-female Marvel movie</a>, saying: “There’s an interest in having women at the forefront of this phase. I feel like it’s hopeful.”</p>
      <p>The conversation has come up again recently, with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/brie-larson-marvel-actresses-all-female-movie-2555744">Brie Larson saying that “a lot” of Marvel actresses have expressed interest in the idea</a>.</p>
      <p>Thompson recently stated that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/tessa-thompson-creed-iii-will-happen-eventually-2557676">she believes a third <i>Creed</i> movie will happen eventually</a>.</p>
      <p>“I feel so lucky that doing the <i>Creed</i> movies, I get to write that music and perform that music,” Thompson said on a panel at a recent Comic Con.</p>
      <p>“And I think we’re going to make a <i>Creed 3</i> eventually so I’ll make more music then.”</p>
