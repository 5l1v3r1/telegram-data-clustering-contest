      <h1>Peaky Blinders series six begins filming as Cillian Murphy returns to set in Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Pictures from the set have revealed a major spoiler about the next season — as Cillian Murphy is officially coming back</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:49:49+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Peaky Blinders series six is officially underway as filming began in Liverpool this week.</p>
      <p>And pictures from the set have revealed a major spoiler about the next season — as Cillian Murphy is officially coming back.</p>
      <p>The actor, who plays main character Tommy Shelby, was reunited with his co-star Paul Anderson as they shot scenes in the city's Stanley Dock.</p>
      <p>Series five ended on a huge cliffhanger as Tommy put a gun to his head after being haunted by the spirit of his dead wife.</p>
      <p>But he appears to be alive and well if pictures of Cillian in the gangster's famous flat cap are anything to go by.</p>

      <p>Paul, who plays Tommy's brother Arthur Shelby, was seen heading to the set in full costume.</p>
      <p>Fans had suspected that Tommy may return as the show is rumoured to be carrying on until its seventh season.</p>
      <p>Series five ended on a disastrous note for Tommy as his plan to assassinate his fascist political rival Sir Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) ended in close allies being killed, while his cousin Michael Gray (Finn Cole) revealed his ambitions to take over from Tommy before leaving for America.</p>

      <p>So, with threats still out there, including from the Scottish gang the Billy Boys who remain at large, what kind of problems will plague the Shelby family in the sixth season?</p>
      <p>Season 5 director  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/anthony-byrne">Anthony Byrne</a>  revealed what to expect from the next season while speaking on the BBC podcast  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nxm2t">Obsessed With Peaky Blinders</a> .</p>
      <p>"Gina, and whoever her family are, will make themselves known," revealed Byrne, who will return to direct the sixth run of the show.</p>

      <p>Fans were very distrustful of Michael's wife Gina Gray (Anya Taylor-Joy) when watching the fifth run, as she proved to be very ambitious for her husband's - and her own - interests.</p>
      <p>The finale also revealed that Gina's family are heavily involved in drug trafficking in America, meaning they are surely some dangerous enemies for Tommy to deal with.</p>
      <p>Byrne also revealed on the podcast that we can expect further focus on "Oswald Mosley and some people around him and his world."</p>

      <p>The show will likely cover the period when Mosley married his wife Diana Guinness at the home of leading Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels</p>
      <p>Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was also a guest at the wedding, so don't be surprised if we see some other notorious historical figures appearing.</p>
      <p>The show is expected to return late next year.</p>
