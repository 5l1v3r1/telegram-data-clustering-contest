      <p>WAUPACA, Wis. - A third man has been sentenced to probation for his role in the death of a man killed when a homemade cannon exploded in Waupaca County.</p>
      <p>Thirty-eight-year-old Robert Mattes pleaded no contest Monday to endangering safety by using a dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct. A felony charge of negligent homicide was dismissed.</p>
      <p>WLUK-TV reports Mattes was placed on probation for a year and won't spend any time behind bars in the May death of Paul Casperson at a Town of DuPont home. A complaint says Casperson died after he was struck by a steel fragment from the cannon device.</p>
      <p>Previously, Kenneth Niemer and Scott Mattes received the same sentence on the same charges.</p>
