      <ul>
        <li>Democrat, 95, is oldest living president, in office 1977-81</li>
        <li>Carter Center: no complications from hematoma operation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The former US president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter">Jimmy Carter</a> was admitted to a hospital on Monday evening for surgery to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding due to recent falls, his spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1194270636857790464">statement</a> on Tuesday morning, the Carter Center, the Atlanta-based nonprofit he founded after leaving the White House, said Carter was “recovering at Emory University hospital following surgery this morning to relieve pressure on his brain from a subdural hematoma”.</p>
      <p>“There are no complications from the surgery,” the statement added, saying the former president would remain in hospital “as long as advisable for observation”.</p>
      <p>Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, expressed thanks for all well wishes and support.</p>
      <p>Carter, 95, has fallen at least three times this year, and the first incident in the spring required hip replacement surgery.</p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/07/jimmy-carter-receives-stitches-after-fall-at-home-in-georgia">a fall on 6 October</a> which resulted in 14 stitches, he traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, and helped build a Habitat for Humanity home. Carter was briefly hospitalized after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/jimmy-carter-president-hospital-pelvis-fall">fracturing his pelvis on 21 October</a>.</p>
      <p>He received a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 but survived and has since said he is cancer-free.</p>
      <p>Nearly four decades after he left office, the oldest-ever former US president still teaches Sunday school around twice a month at Maranatha Baptist church in his tiny hometown of Plains, in south-west <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia">Georgia</a>.</p>
      <p>The Rev Tony Lowden, Carter’s pastor, said the ex-president was hospitalized on Monday on what he called “a rough day”.</p>
      <p>“We just need the whole country to be in prayer for him,” Lowden said.</p>
