      <h1>Cocaine found wrapped in blocks of frozen meat in lorry at UK port</h1>

      <p>A lorry driver has been charged with trying to import class A drugs into the UK, after officers found an estimated £20 million of cocaine wrapped in blocks of frozen meat in the back of a lorry.</p>
      <p>The National Crime Agency said more than 200kg of the drug was seized from the Dutch-registered refrigerated HGV when it arrived at Harwich, Essex from the Hook of Holland on Monday.</p>
      <p>The drugs were discovered by Border Force officers conducting checks.</p>
      <p>Robert Tromp, from Hillegom in the Netherlands, was charged and appeared before Colchester Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, the National Crime Agency said.</p>

      <p>Tromp, 48, was remanded in custody to appear at Chelmsford Crown Court on December 12.</p>
      <p>National Crime Agency branch commander Jacque Beer said: “While forensic checks are still being carried out on this seizure, it is likely that the total haul would have had a street value in excess of £20 million once cut and sold at a street purity level.</p>
      <p>“Our investigation into those responsible is continuing, but we can say that this will have put a big dent in the profits of the criminal network likely to be behind it and caused them substantial disruption.”</p>
