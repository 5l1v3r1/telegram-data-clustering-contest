      <p><i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> have been one of the more controversial Pokémon titles in recent times. It <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/11/internet-reacts-to-game-freak-laying-off-478-pokemon">was revealed</a> not the entire back catalogue of 'mons would make the final game. For the first time in the series' history, a very limited dex would be available. Instead, there would be only 400 to catch with the remaining 478 not being available at all in the game, including favourites like Bulbasaur and Squirtle.</p>
      <p>Whether that will be enough to deter longtime fans from the game, however, remains to be seen.</p>
