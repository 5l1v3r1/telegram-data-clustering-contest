      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/5/15/17345246/the-past-present-and-future-of-the-binding-of-isaac">Edmund McMillen</a>, the man behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-binding-of-isaac/2768"><i>The Binding of Isaac</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/super-meat-boy/2125"><i>Super Meat Boy</i></a>, is back with a new game. It’s called <i>The Legend of Bum-Bo</i> and it’s unlike any of his previous games. The “deckbuilding roguelike” is turn-based, and looks like it’s made out of paper. We’ve embedded the trailer above, but you can also watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/-sNhPqfJmDs">on YouTube</a>.</p>
      <p>Developed by McMillen and James Interactive, <i>Bum-Bo</i> allows players to take on the role of different variants of Bum-Bo, each with different powers. The item system uses cards, which can be collected, upgraded, and used to create combos to battle the game’s 30 different enemies. The payoff comes in battles against 10 “ugly, yet cute bosses.”</p>
      <p>The description on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/steam">Steam</a> is fairly spartan, as is the price of $14.99.</p>
      <p>McMillen has had a busy year. His <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/12/17564244/binding-of-isaac-board-game-kickstarter-successful">physical card game, <i>The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls</i></a>, earned <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/isaacfoursouls/the-binding-of-isaac-four-souls/description">more than $2.6 million on Kickstarter</a> last year, and it shipped to backers on time. Extras are even in stock, and <a href="https://studio71games.com/products/the-binding-of-isaac-four-souls-game">selling for $40</a>. A new expansion for The Binding of Isaac video game, <a href="https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_Repentance_(Pre-Release)"><i>Repentence</i></a>, is also on the way.</p>
