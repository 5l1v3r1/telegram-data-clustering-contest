      <p>This latest chapter, curated by <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/10632/the-style-codes-of-wong-kar-wais-most-romantic-films">Kar Wai</a> and directed by Hong Kong-based filmmaker, photographer and artist <a href="http://www.wingshya.com/">Wing Shya</a> – known for intimate portraiture taken amid saturated Hong Kong landscapes – is titled <i>A Night in Shanghai</i>, set in the city where Kar Wai was born. The film, which will premiere at the Yuz Museum in Shanghai’s art district later this month, promises to be “a story about the introspective search for ourself,” according to the house. “Ju Xiaowen is walking on the wire, trying to find the balance in real life by comparing the past and the present... looking for who she is and moved by the desire to express herself.”</p>
      <p>Of the project, which will be open to the public at the museum from November 22 to 24, Kar Wai says: “Saint Laurent is unique, distinctive among high fashion. Anthony loves art and his designs worn gorgeously, and stays independent. Saint Laurent is always about ‘breaking the balance’ in this era, like no one else, the brand is brave in expressing itself.”</p>
      <p>“Wong Kar Wai envisions individual feelings; his art is like a vivid dream projected into real life, which emphasises the contrast between the fragile aspect of humanity and reality,” adds Vaccarello. “It was a very instinctive process based on mutual respect and admiration, in the movie you can find and feel the Saint Laurent fantasy taking shape as natural consequence.”</p>
