      <p>Google could soon call out websites that load slowly by displaying a badge of shame within its Chrome web browser.</p>
      <p>The tech giant said it believes the web “can do better” and is considering a badge system to encourage developers to up their game when building websites.</p>
      <p>Poorly built websites or those using old practices can have an impact on website loading speeds irrespective of the user’s broadband connection.</p>
      <p>The company will do this by looking at how long it takes websites to load historically.</p>

      <p>“Further along, we may expand this to include identifying when a page is likely to be slow for a user based on their device and network conditions,” the firm said.</p>
      <p>“We are being very mindful with our approach to setting the bar for what is considered a good user experience and hope to land on something that is practically achievable by all developers.”</p>
      <p>Google is looking into various ways of achieving this, such as a splash screen which appears when the page is loading, warning people that the page “usually loads slow”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fast websites would feature a green progress indicator.</p>
      <p>The company is urging web developers not to “wait to optimise your site”, offering a number of resources to help improve their loading speeds.</p>
