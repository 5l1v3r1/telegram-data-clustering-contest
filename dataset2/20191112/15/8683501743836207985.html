      <p>The <i>Star Wars</i> franchise has been enthralling moviegoers for decades, and is showing no real signs of slowing down. When Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the property was kickstarted back up with J.J. Abrams' <i>The Force Awakens</i>, and the introduction of standalone films. Abrams introduced a new set of characters to the franchise, alongside franchise favorites like Leia, Han, And Luke. Rian Johnson took over for <i>The Last Jedi</i>, and Abrams recently revealed <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2394971/why-subverting-expectations-was-incredibly-important-to-star-wars-the-jedi-according-to-mark-hamill">how the subversive</a> and surprising choices from that movie helped inspire him to take more risks for the highly anticipated <i>Rise of Skywalker</i>.</p>
      <p>There is a ton of pressure on J.J. Abrams to deliver with <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>, especially following the disappointing performance of <i>Solo: A Star Wars Story</i>. Additionally, <i>Episode IX</i> will wrap up the nine-film Skywalker Saga. Abrams recently spoke to the affect Rian Johnson's <i>The Last Jedi</i>, and his experience on <i>The Force Awakens,</i> had on his upcoming blockbuster, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>On this one, I let myself be, at least in the way I was approaching the thing, freer. In <i>Episode VII</i>, I was adhering to a kind of approach that felt right for <i>Star Wars</i> in my head. It was about finding a visual language, like shooting on locations and doing practical things as much as possible. And we continue that in <i>Episode IX</i>, but I also found myself doing things that I’m not sure I would have been as daring to do on <i>Episode VII</i>.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that's certainly interesting. It looks like J.J. Abrams might have been in his head too much when working on <i>The Force Awakens</i>. But now that he's back for his sophomore run in the galaxy far, far away, he's more confident and eager to take risks.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470278/why-star-wars-episode-ix-is-called-the-rise-of-skywalker-according-to-jj-abrams">Related: Why Star Wars: Episode IX Is Called The Rise Of Skywalker, According To JJ Abrams</a>
      </p>
      <p>This makes a great deal of sense, as <i>The Force Awakens</i> was the first new <i>Star Wars</i> movie to hit theaters since the prequels. <i>Episode VII</i> made a ton of money at the box office, and was the biggest pop culture event of 2015. But the movie did get some criticism for too closely resembling <i>A New Hope</i>, with the young Jedi on a desert planet and a planet-destroying weapon that needed to be destroyed.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the coin, Rian Johnson's <i>The Last Jedi</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483715/how-star-wars-the-last-jedi-backlash-helped-rian-johnson-make-knives-out">received some backlash</a> for being too subversive. He purposefully went against fan expectations, unceremoniously <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2463543/andy-serkis-wishes-snoke-survived-star-wars-the-last-jedi">killing off Snoke</a> and seemingly answering the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476103/the-question-of-reys-parents-is-answered-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-daisy-ridley-confirms">question of Rey's parentage</a>. And while some fans took umbrage with his choices, Lucasfilm was happy enough with his efforts to give Johnson the opportunity to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483704/are-rian-johnsons-star-wars-movies-still-happening-hes-waiting-for-an-update-too">direct a future installmen</a>t of the franchise. In his same conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-jj-abrams-interview-force-awakens/">Games Radar</a>, J.J. Abrams explained how that influenced him, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>Rian helped remind me that that’s why we’re on these movies – not to just do something that you’ve seen before. I won’t say that I felt constrained or limited on <i>VII</i>, but I found myself wanting to do something that felt more consistent with the original trilogy than not. And on <i>IX</i>, I found myself feeling like I’m just gonna go for it a bit more.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, this is exciting. It shows that J.J. Abrams could seemingly go anywhere with <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>, especially as he attempts to provide an adequate ending to the beloved space opera. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483430/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-supercut-adds-final-trailer-footage">The trailers</a> already show that he's pulling no punches, with the group of heroes assembled on a mission across the galaxy. What's more, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482898/5-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-moments-that-point-to-palpatines-potential-survival">the inclusion of Emperor Palpatine</a> shows that there will be plenty of major plot twists.</p>
      <p>All will be revealed when <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> hits theaters on December 20th.
