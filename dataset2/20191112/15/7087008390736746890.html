      <h1>CoinDeal enters the USA with 13 cryptocurrency markets and it’s own CDL Token market</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:42:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Press Release</a></address>
      <p>[PRESS RELEASE]</p>
      <p>A few months ago, CoinDeal like other lead exchanges, has created its own<a href="http://token.coindeal.com/"> CoinDeal Token </a>(CDL). The CDL is based on the ETH blockchain, which will enable a fast trading process and will allow users to gain many advantages while using the platform. The CoinDeal Token market has been launched!</p>
      <h3>The first token in the world which was given for free</h3>
      <p><a href="https://frontend.coindeal.com/market/CDL-BTC/#utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fcryptopotato.com%2F&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=CDL_Token_USA&amp;utm_term=12.11.2019">CoinDeal</a> distributed 90% of its tokens to users, 87549 people received – 514 tokens each. The current price is about $12.90 for 514 tokens (data from November 12th, 2019, 2:08 p.m.) GMT. This means that the exchange users received a total of $1,129,382. The exchange did not buy any tokens from the market, so the price was set by the market itself.</p>

      <p>A week before the launch of <a href="https://frontend.coindeal.com/market/CDL-BTC/">the market</a>, the CDL was in possession of over 80K users, which is not a common situation in the industry. For example, based on the data (etherscan.io, 31st October 2019) Tether has 507.537 addresses (one person can own several addresses), while Binance Coin has 314,024. What’s more interesting, the popular TrueUSD is a resource of only about 25,561 addresses.</p>
