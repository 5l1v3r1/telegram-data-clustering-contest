      <h2>Here's when season 2 of Titans arrives, along with all the trailers, and how to watch it outside the US - or without a DC Universe subscription</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:02:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>The second season of the popular DC Comics TV show Titans is here - if you're in the US. Titans is based on the Teen Titans group, which includes Robin and a group of other young superheroes and sidekicks (in this instance Raven, Starfire and Beast Boy) teaming up to fight crime. </p>
      <p>Titans is a grim 'n' gritty take on the material (arguably better known for its light-hearted cartoons), and was the debut original show for DC Universe - the company's dedicated streaming platform. The show airs on DC Universe, which unfortunately is currently only available in the US at the moment. </p>
      <p>But there is a way to watch Titans in the UK and the rest of the world, and it's even possible to watch Titans without a DC Universe subscription in the US. Here's how, along with all the news, casting info, and trailers for the show so far.</p>
      <h3>When does Titans season 2 come to the UK?</h3>
      <p>Titans season 2 will has already aired in the US on the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3684739-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Ftitans-3684739%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dcuniverse.com">DC Universe streaming platform</a>, which costs $7.99 per month, and also includes a selection of classic DC TV shows and films along with digital comics and bonuses like store discounts and special giveaways.</p>
      <p>You can't get DC Universe outside of the US, but don't worry: <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3684739-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Ftitans-3684739%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F80218200">Netflix has the global rights to Titans</a> outside the US (and China) so as long as you have a Netflix subscription you can still watch it if you're not American. The only thing we don't know is when the show will air. However, season 1 of Titans first dropped on Netflix UK in December, so we'll likely see season 2 come out around a similar time, or maybe even early 2020.</p>
      <p>If you're worried about waiting and want to be sure to watch the show immediately, but you're not in the US, check out our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-dc-universe-outside-us-3683996/">guide to accessing DC Universe from outside the US</a>.</p>
      <h3>How to watch Titans without DC Universe</h3>
      <p>If you're in the US you might want to watch Titans season 2 but balk at the $7.99 monthly fee - which you'll have to pay for three full months if you want to watch the full show as it airs. The good news is that you can watch Titans without a DC Universe subscription - you'll just need a VPN and a Netflix account.</p>
      <p>Since Netflix is distributing the show outside the US, anyone with a Netflix account can watch it - though you'll have to wait a bit, as it hasn't reached Netflix just yet. You just need to use a VPN and set the server to a country that has the show on Netflix - you might as well use the UK - and then you can access UK Netflix and watch Titans without paying extra for DC Universe.</p>
      <p>Check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/internet/best-streaming-vpn-3674177/">best VPNs for streaming video</a> if you want a VPN recommendation - or just go straight to <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3684739-11-0000000">NordVPN</a>, currently our top choice.</p>
      <p>Note that while this isn't illegal, it is against Netflix's terms and conditions, and so the company technically could revoke your account - but it's very unlikely to. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
      <h3>How many episodes are there?</h3>
      <p>Each season of Titans includes 11 episodes, each of which release weekly on DC Universe, rather than the whole season arriving at once.</p>
      <h3>What is Titans season 2 about?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Spoilers for Titans season 1</b>
      </p>
      <p>The season 1 finale of Titans left us on a cliffhanger when Dick Grayson/Robin was shown to be completely under Trigon's control after putting him through a series of hallucinations. No doubt that the second season will pick up here, and we'll probably learn more about the backstory of Trigon. </p>
      <p>According to the latest trailers for Titans season 2, it looks like we'll be seeing a big expansion to the current team - see below for full details. We'll also be getting a brand new villain in the form of Deathstroke - a DC fan favourite. </p>
      <h3>Will there be a season 3?</h3>
      <p>Yup! DC Universe has already confirmed that a third season of the show is on the way, and due some time in fall 2020:</p>
