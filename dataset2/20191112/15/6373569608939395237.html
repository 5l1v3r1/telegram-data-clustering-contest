      <h2>Drug addict Thomas Fagan started to doze off in the dock during his hearing</h2>

      <p>A drug addict thief has been jailed after he started to doze off in the dock during a court hearing.</p>
      <p>Prolific thief Thomas Fagan, aged 32, appeared to be falling asleep as he sat before a judge.</p>
      <p>He was facing jail in any case for failing to tackle his heroin addiction despite help from counsellors and probation officers.</p>
      <p>The probation service dragged him to Plymouth Crown Court because he has failed to comply with a community order for a string of offences – including threatening to stab a security guard.</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Darlow remanded Fagan into custody until Monday so he is wide awake during sentencing.</p>
      <p>He told him: “I won’t have you falling asleep through proceedings.”</p>

      <p>Fagan, who started using heroin at the age of 14, sat in the dock with his head drooping.</p>
      <p>A male supporter, thought to be his father, called out his name from the public gallery in an apparent attempt to revive him.</p>
      <p>Fagan, of no fixed address, denied he had been asleep as he was taken away in handcuffs.</p>
      <p>Judge Darlow had warned Fagan that he would adjourn the hearing if he could not pay attention.</p>

      <p>Ali Rafati, Fagan’s barrister, had told the court that his client had been “passing in and out of consciousness” before the hearing.</p>
      <p>Holly Rust, for the probation service, told the hearing that Fagan had shown a “complete disregard” of his community order.</p>
      <p>She added: “He has no desire to address his substance misuse. It is probation’s recommendation that the order be revoked and he be resentenced.”</p>
      <p>Fagan threatened to stab a security guard with scissors as he stole a Surprise Doll from Smyths<a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/valium-fuelled-thief-armed-scissors-2855786"> in September last year</a>. He was under the influence of Valium at the time of the offence in Friary Mill.</p>
