      <p>United were beaten 2-0 by the Catalan giants in Rome a decade ago, courtesy of goals from striker Samuel Eto'o and superstar Messi.</p>
      <p>According to <i>GiveMeSport</i>, it was due to that game that then-president Joan Laporta set up a scheme that would see all of Barca's former and present players paid lifetime salaries, with more than 290 players believed to be on the payroll.</p>
      <p>One of them is Juan Carlos Heredia, who spent five years with the Blaugrana between 1974 and 1979 and won the 1979 Cup Winners' Cup with the club, and he has since opened up about the agreement, one that he credits Messi for.</p>

      <p>"When Barcelona won the Champions League final in Rome against Manchester United with a goal from Messi, the club president declared that all those who were European champions with Barcelona were going to receive a salary for life," he told <i>The Tactical Room</i>.</p>
      <p>"And he fulfilled it."</p>
