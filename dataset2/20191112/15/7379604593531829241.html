The PM was sent another letter by incoming commission president Ursula von der Leyen by the end of the week – after he missed the last EU deadline. Von der Leyen is now expecting a reply by the end of the week, a spokeswoman said. The body, which normally comprises of one representative from each member state, holds powers including negotiating international trade deals, policing members states' finances and proposing EU-wide laws on a range of topics including the environment and migration. Under EU laws, Britain is obliged to propose a name. The other 27 EU states also made clear London needs to do that when they granted Johnson the latest Brexit delay last month. A spokesman for the British mission to the EU confirmed on Tuesday Britain had received and was considering a letter from von der Leyen. A spokesman for Johnson said on Monday when asked about naming a new commissioner said Britain would meet its legal obligations and officials were in contact with Von der Leyen's team.</li>

The “McStrike” is part of a global day of action for fast food employees called by the International Union of Food Workers, which will see events in countries including France, Belgium, Brazil, Chile and New Zealand. The Shadow Chancellor said: “Low pay and insecure work is endemic in the fast food industry. “A Labour government will take on the big corporations such as McDonald's to stop them from paying out poverty wages. “Labour's commitment to a £10-an-hour real living wage and an end to in-work poverty will help millions of low-paid workers across the country.”</li>
