        <b>F1 legend Emerson Fittipaldi thinks the rivalry between <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> drivers <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> can <i>"only be good" </i>for the Italian team, as the Brazilian explains the competition between the duo raises the overall level within the team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leclerc and Vettel have been very well-matched so far this season, although Leclerc has edged Vettel in terms of points as well as in qualifying. </p>

      <p>However, especially after the summer break, tensions have been within the Ferrari garage, with multiple arguments between the two drivers surfacing during Grands Prix. Vettel undercutting pole-sitter Leclerc in Singapore and Vettel not letting the Monegasque past a race later in Russia are examples of the two stars budding heads.</p>
      <p>Fittipaldi, a two-time Formula 1 champion in the 70's with Lotus and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a>, sees positives in this rivalry.</p>

      <p><i>"Seb is still fast and Charles is talented,"</i> the 72-year-old started explaining to <i>Gazzetta dello Sport.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Their coexistence can only do Ferrari good, because they raise the level of the team, pushing each other and suggesting changes to the car, as they observe what the other does. </i>
        <i>I think that Ferrari have improved during the season because of this.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"And I see it</i> [Ferrari]<i> as very strong in 2020. If they keep the same engine advantage, I think it will be difficult for Mercedes to beat it."</i></p>
      <p>When asked to compare the way Ferrari handle their drivers compared to Mercedes, Fittipaldi preferred the way the Silver Arrows go about their business, as he compares it to his driving days.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I really like the approach of Toto Wolff, who leaves his drivers free to fight, except when you get to a certain point in the championship and you have to help the driver who is ahead in the standings.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"The same thing happened at Lotus: Colin Chapman</i> [Lotus' founder and boss]<i> let us</i> [fight]<i>."</i></p>
