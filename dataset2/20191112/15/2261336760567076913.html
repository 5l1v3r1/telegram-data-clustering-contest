      <p>Cris Cyborg is still aching to get back at Amanda Nunes. In a recent run-in with TMZ Sports, the former long-time women’s featherweight champion wants the rematch with “The Lioness” in a possible cross-promotion between Bellator and the UFC.</p>
      <p>“Before I signed with Bellator, the first thing I asked Scott for (is) maybe to have the possibility to fight (against UFC fighters) – the same he’s doing for Rizin (with) his champions fighting with champions in Japan. … I said maybe if he’ll be able to do that,” Cyborg said (via <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/cris-cyborg-wants-amanda-nunes-rematch-bellator-vs-ufc-cross-promotion-dana-white">MMA Junkie</a>).</p>
      <p>“Cris Cyborg (vs.) Amanda Nunes – she’s the UFC champion, and I hope in the future (UFC) vs. Bellator champion, maybe the fight will happen. Scott said yes, we can do that,” Cyborg added. “Dana White (just has) to call him and make this happen, and I think everybody would like to watch.”</p>
      <p>“One-fight deal – just call Scott.”</p>
      <p>Bellator CEO Scott Coker already said he’s <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/6/14/18678400/bellator-ufc-scott-coker-open-cross-promotion-killers-league-mma-news">open to a cross-promotion</a> with the UFC. For now, he is set to work with Japanese promotion Rizin in an <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/8/20954814/photo-the-bellator-x-rizin-poster-for-nye-is-pretty-amazing">event scheduled for New Year’s Eve </a>at the Saitama Super Arena.</p>
      <p>Cyborg, meanwhile, will challenge women’s featherweight champion Julia Budd for her Bellator debut in January.</p>
