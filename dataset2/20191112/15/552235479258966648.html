      <p>A giant of the sporting and business world has died, leaving an indelible mark on Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>Bill Barr OBE, who was 80, passed away on Friday.</p>
      <p>The former Ayr United chairman, who bankrolled the club’s only national cup final, was hailed for leading his beloved Honest Men on a “rollercoaster ride”.</p>
      <p>His Ayr Scottish Eagles completed an ice hockey Grand Slam in only their second season in 1997-98.</p>
      <p>Bill transformed his family’s small building firm into one of the UK’s largest privately-owned construction companies.</p>
      <p>During his 34 years at the helm, the Barr organisation built everything from motorways to whisky distilleries, and schools to water treatment works.</p>
      <p>He oversaw the construction of more than 100 retail supermarkets and 35 rugby and football stadiums throughout Britain, including Southampton’s 36,000-seater St Mary’s.</p>
      <p>Current Ayr United director, Lewis Grant, said: “He took the town of Ayr – and the whole county for that matter – on the greatest rollercoaster ride.”</p>
