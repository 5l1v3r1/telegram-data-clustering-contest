      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:58:37+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>When you're booked into an early morning flight, sometimes it's easier to just get up and go, and sort out breakfast at the airport.</p>
      <p>A hearty breakfast can also be just the thing to fill you up before the long journey, not to mention it stops you from buying the often overpriced snacks sold on flights.</p>
      <p>However, at some UK airports, it can feel like breakfast alone makes quite the dent in your holiday budget.</p>
      <p>Flight comparison site <a href="https://www.jetcost.co.uk/">JetCost</a> surveyed 20 of the UK's busiest airports to unearth the culprits, and find out just where British holidaymakers can find the cheapest airport breakfasts across both full English and vegetarian options. (You can check out the full lists below).</p>
      <p>When it came to a hearty full English offering, Aberdeen proved to offer the cheapest breakfast with its lowest prices at £8.95 at The Granite City restaurant.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, London City had the most expensive prices - its cheapest breakfast offering came in at £17.95 at the Pilots Bar &amp; Kitchen restaurant.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, vegetarians may want to consider flights from Glasgow, Edinburgh or London Heathrow, all three of which tied with the cheapest breakfast price of £7.45.</p>
      <p>Once again it was London City which proved the most expensive, with its cheapest vegetarian breakfast priced at £14.95.</p>
      <p>Of course it's worth noting that these were the prices found specifically for a full breakfast - this doesn't count alternatives such as fruit, yoghurts, sandwiches, bagels and porridge.</p>
