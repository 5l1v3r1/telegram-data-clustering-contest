      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> want Robert Preston, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-gary-windass/">Gary Windass</a> and Geoff Metcalfe to be killed off in the soap.</p>
      <p>At the moment, all three characters aren't popular for different reasons.</p>
      <p>Robert is <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-fed-up-with-stupid-vicky-and-robert-storyline/">currently living a double life, engaged to two women with one of them expecting his baby</a>.</p>

      <p>In last night's episode (November 11 2019) the three men continued with their lies and manipulation.</p>
      <p>As Robert was on the way back from visiting his second fiancée Vicky, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-robert-rushed-to-hospital-after-horror-car-crash/">he got into a car accident on the phone to Michelle</a>, his other fiancé.</p>
      <p>As Michelle waited by Robert's bedside, she noticed he had a necklace which said 'Big Daddy' - which he got due to the fact Vicky is expecting his baby.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Geoff was still furious with Yasmeen for not trusting him.</p>
      <p>Although he didn't want to go with her to Las Vegas, he eventually changed his mind and decided to go on the trip with her.</p>

      <p>But not before he told her off for not listening to him and accusing her of being controlling for packing his suitcase.</p>

      <p>As all of this was going on, Gary treated his new girlfriend Maria to a designer handbag, but wasn't happy to hear she put in a good word about her ex Dr Ali Neeson.</p>
      <p>Ali, who misdiagnosed Emma's burst appendix as food poisoning went to a meeting to hear his fate, and Maria told his colleague Dr Gaddas that he was a good person who just made a mistake.</p>
      <p>Gary was fuming when he found this out, having threatened Ali to keep away from Maria the previous week.</p>
