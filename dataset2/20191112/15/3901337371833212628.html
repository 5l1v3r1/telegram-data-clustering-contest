      <p>The Glamour Boys are flying high at present on the back of a Soweto Derby win over Orlando Pirates that took them 10 points clear at the top of the Absa Premiership table, and they have several of their key players who have jetted out of the country over the last couple of days to team up with their respective national teams.</p>
      <p>Khama Billiat headed to Zimbabwe, Lazarous Kambole is part of the Zambian national team, Daniel Akpeyi landed a Nigerian recall, while Erick Mathoho and Lebogang Manyama just arrived in Ghana to face the Black Stars on Thursday evening in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</p>
      <p>Along with their players, Chiefs also lost their reserve team head coach, Arthur Zwane, and analyst, Vaughan Coetzee, who Ntseki decided to add to his technical team as he goes in search of his first competitive win since taking over from Stuart Baxter.</p>
      <p>“Five Kaizer Chiefs players and two technical officials have been called up to represent South Africa in the 2021 AFCON Qualifiers during this FIFA International break.</p>

      <p>A statement on Chiefs’ official website read, “In this FIFA break, coach Molefi Ntseki called up centre back Erick Mathoho and midfielder Lebogang Manyama in his Bafana Bafana squad. Ntseki also roped into his technical staff, the services of Chiefs’ video analyst Vaughan Coetzee and to assist him, Ntseki called for the services of the Reserves team coach Arthur Zwane.”</p>
