      <p>Back in September, it was announced that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/looking-back-at-the-albums-of-the-national-lampoon.html">National Lampoon</a> — now <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/05/national-lampoon-evan-shapiro-new-president-resuscitate-comedy-brand-palmstar-animal-house-1202606020/">undergoing a revival thanks to former Seeso head Evan Shapiro</a> — will bring back the classic radio show <i>The National Lampoon Radio Hour </i>in podcast form, and the cast of comedians attached to the project is very exciting. <i>Difficult People </i>alum <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/cole-escola-best-impressions.html">Cole Escola</a> serves as head writer and producer, stand-up Jo Firestone serves as senior writer and producer, and both double as performers alongside. The ensemble includes rising comedians <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/follow-friday-twitter-interview-rachel-pegram.html">Rachel Pegram</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/special-without-brett-davis-best-moments.html">Brett Davis</a>, <a href="http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/09/maeve-higgins-grub-street-diet.html">Maeve Higgins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex3nglish">Alex English</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/chris-fleming-carmen-christopher-lorelei-ramirez-comedy-videos.html">Lorelei Ramirez</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/megstalter">Megan Stalter</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/why-well-miss-the-oppositions-josh-sharp-and-aaron-jackson.html">Aaron Jackson</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/martinurbano">Martin Urbano</a>. In addition to the main cast, the podcast will feature special guest appearances by Rachel Dratch, Chris Gethard, and Amy Sedaris, and it will be released in both audio and video form. The 11-episode, half-hour show <a href="https://foreverdogpodcasts.com/podcasts/national-lampoon-radio-hour">will launch on the Forever Dog podcast network</a> on Thursday, December 19, ahead of National Lampoon’s 50th anniversary next year — and we have the very first promo right here. As Firestone says in the clip, “What else would you want? What else would you want?” No, seriously: <i>What else would you want? </i>Let Jo and Cole know, maybe they can help you out with that.</p>
