      <h1>Joe Biden says there's 'zero rationale' for GOP to call on son Hunter to testify in impeachment hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T02:43:04+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 02:43</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> declared Monday there was "zero rationale" for Republican lawmakers to have his son Hunter testify before Congress as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Hunter Biden's financial involvement in the Ukraine gas company Burisma -- while his father was in office -- has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks since the House of Representatives formally launched the impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> over his conversation with the Ukrainian president about investigating the Bidens. With public impeachment hearings scheduled for this week, Republicans recently included Hunter Biden on a list of witnesses they wanted to hear under oath.</p>
      <p>Appearing on a televised town hall Monday, the 2020 frontrunner doubled down on his claim that no wrongdoing took place while he was vice president.</p>
      <p>"Every single, solitary, serious investigator... looked at this and said there's absolutely zero basis to the accusation that I acted inappropriately or that my son did," Biden told the Iowa audience. "This is all about Trump trying to create a diversion... There's not a scintilla of evidence pointing out that anything is wrong."</p>
      <p>After calling Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani a "chump," Biden dismissed Republicans' inclusion of his son on their testimony wish list.</p>

      <p>"There is zero rationale for that to happen," Biden told CNN anchor Erin Burnett. "Nobody has suggested that anything was done that was inappropriate. This is all a diversion. This is classic Trump, classic Trump. Focus on the problems. We have a president who is one of the most corrupt people to serve in that office."</p>
      <p>The former vice president continued, "I released 21 years of my tax returns in detail. Mr. President, you're worried about corruption? Release some of yours!"</p>
