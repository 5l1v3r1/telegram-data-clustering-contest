      <h1>Scott McTominay injury leaves Man Utd star set to miss Man City and Tottenham clashes</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United midfielder expected to be out for four weeks following initial scans on ankle injury suffered in win over Brighton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T02:36:19+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 02:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay looks set to miss matches against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> following initial scans on his ankle injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> fear McTominay could be out for four weeks, which would rule him out of games against the Red Devils' 'big six' rivals as well as Sheffield United, Astana and Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>However, due to the significant swelling on McTominay's ankle, a second scan is required which will take place in the next 72 hours.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old midfielder was taken off in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-utd-3-1-brighton-20853932">United's 3-1 win</a> over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday, having been a doubt for the game in the first place after taking a knock to his foot in the Europa League win over Partizan Belgrade three days earlier.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">McTominay</a> has been one of United's most consistent performers this season, with only centre-half Harry Maguire having played more minutes than the Scotland international.</p>

      <p>After the game against Brighton, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer voiced fears McTominay could be out for two months as the United boss recalled a similar injury he had suffered himself in his playing days.</p>
      <p>However, following the initial scan the club feel it will be closer to four weeks, according to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/manchester-united-fear-scott-mctominay-four-weeks-suspected-ankle-ligament-damage-11078880/">Metro</a> .</p>
      <p>Solskjaer said after the game: "He went over on his ankle. It's a painful one.</p>
      <p>"I've had one and I was out for eight weeks. But then again sometimes you're back in two weeks, so I don't know.</p>

      <p>"It looked painful and he's not one for rolling around."</p>
      <p>McTominay was able to leave Old Trafford without assistance after the game but staff have since ordered him to wear a protective boot and to limit weight-bearing for the remainder of the week.</p>
      <p>United are away to Sheffield United on November 24 following the international break, before a Europa League game against Astana in Kazakhstan on November 28.</p>
      <p>They then host Aston Villa on December 1 and Tottenham three days later before visiting the Etihad for a clash against derby rivals City on December 7.</p>
      <p>McTominay looks certain to miss Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifiers away to Cyprus on Saturday and at home to Kazakhstan a week on Tuesday.</p>
