      <p>Sometimes the kanji says it all. Though in most cases it is largely impossible to foretell a character’s meaning from its shape — 田 (window?), 今 (bus stop?), 無 (cockroach in motion?) — the semantics of this one cuts right through you: 中.</p>
      <p>Read <i>naka</i>, <i>chū</i> or <i>jū</i>, 中 captures the complex meaning of being within, between or in the middle of something. In its most straightforward sense, it translates simply as “in”: 家の中 (<i>ie no naka</i>, in the house), カバンの中 (<i>kaban no naka</i>¸ in the bag) or, more metaphysically, 心の中 (<i>kokoro no naka</i>, in the heart). Even when outside, you can still be “in” something, for instance, 雨の中 (<i>ame no naka</i>, in the rain).</p>
      <p>The “middle” meaning of 中 becomes apparent in terms like 中指 (<i>nakayubi</i>, the middle finger or toe) and 中庭 (<i>nakaniwa</i>, a courtyard between buildings). One of my favorite “middle” expressions is 中古 (<i>chūko</i>), which means “second-hand” and literally translates as “middle-old.”</p>
      <p>Speaking of which, when you are neither young nor feel really ancient yet, you probably qualify as 中年 (<i>chūnen</i>, middle age), not to be confused with 中世 (<i>chūsei</i>, the Middle Ages). Another term to express in-between states is 中途半端 (<i>chūtohanpa</i>), referring to something in a neither-fish-nor-fowl kind of situation.</p>
      <p>Since being in the middle of something is also a salient geographic property, 中 is a frequent component in place names. For instance, there’s 中東 (<i>chūtō</i>, the Middle East) and, of course, 中国 (<i>chūgoku</i>, China). This latter is not to be mistaken with 中国地方 (<i>chūgoku chihō</i>), the Chugoku region in the western part of Japan.</p>
      <p>Related and yet somewhat different in meaning are a number of 中 expressions referring to the concept of “intermediateness.” Here the term is to be interpreted as a member of the triad 小 (<i>shō</i>, small), 中 (<i>chū</i>, medium) and 大 (<i>dai</i>, big). These are used to classify things in terms of size, in a similar way to S, M and L in English.</p>
      <p>In addition, 中 can also denote an intermediate stage between strong and weak, as in the cooking expressions 強火 (<i>tsuyobi</i>, high flame), 中火 (<i>chūbi</i>, medium flame), and 弱火 (<i>yowabi</i>, low flame). The term 中火nicely illustrates that the “medium” meaning is only contained in the <i>chū</i> reading: Even though <i>nakabi</i> would be a more “logical” pronunciation, given that <i>naka</i> belongs to the same lexical stratum as –<i>bi</i>, it is blocked here because <i>naka</i> just can’t convey the idea of intermediateness.</p>
      <p>Reading also matters when 中 takes on yet another meaning. When something is all over the place, this can be expressed by using 中 as a suffix. The point is that in such cases, it is not read <i>chū</i> but <i>jū</i>. An example is 部屋中 (<i>heya-jū</i>), which is not just about being “in” the room, but being all over it, as in the case of toys, books or — god forbid — cockroaches in motion. Of course, the same trick can be done with larger entities, such as 町中 (<i>machi-jū</i>, throughout town), 日本中 (<i>nihon-jū</i>, all over Japan) and世界中 (<i>sekai-jū</i>, in the whole wide world).</p>
      <p>Apart from its spatial qualities, 中 is also customarily used to anchor things in time. 今週中に (<i>konshū-chū ni</i>), for instance, refers to something to be done within this week, and 今日中に (<i>kyō-jū ni</i>) means it should be finished by the end of today. Note that the <i>chū</i>/<i>jū</i> distinction gets somewhat arbitrary here.</p>
      <p>If we drop the particle <i>ni</i>, we get back to the idea of being right in the middle of, which for time works just as well. A greater number of this type of 中 constructions are used in the busy world of business: 営業中 (<i>eigyō-chū</i>, open), 準備中 (<i>junbi-chū</i>, opening soon), 会員募集中 (<i>kaiin boshū-chū</i>, looking for new members), or キャンペーン実施中 (<i>kyanpēn jisshi-chū</i>, campaign now underway).</p>
      <p>But thinking about it, ordinary life is also a quite busy affair. Most of the time we’re仕事中 (<i>shigoto-chū</i>, working), and when we’re not, we’re 休憩中 (<i>kyūkei-chū</i>, taking a break). We need to eat and sleep, and when we’re “at” these, we are 食事中 (<i>shokuji-chū</i>, eating) and 爆睡中 (<i>bakusui-chū</i>, sleeping like a log). Be careful not to become アル中 (<i>aru-chū</i>), because this term, an abbreviation of アルコール中毒 (<i>arukōru chūdoku</i>), doesn’t mean that you’re just boozing, but that you are an alcoholic.</p>
      <p>Other states we may find ourselves “in” include 検討中 (<i>kentō-chū</i>, considering) and 確認中 (<i>kakunin-chū</i>, confirming), 瞑想中 (<i>meisō-chū</i>, meditating) and 分析中 (<i>bunseki-chū</i>, analyzing), 考え中 (<i>kangae-chū</i>, thinking) and 悩み中 (<i>nayami-chū</i>, brooding).</p>
      <p>Truly, it’s some busy 世の中 (<i>yononaka, </i>world) — and we are right ど真ん中 (<i>domannaka</i>, in the middle) of it.</p>
