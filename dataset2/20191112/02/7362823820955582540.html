      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/caitlyn-jenner-slams-trump-for-relentless-attack-on-transgender-community">Caitlyn Jenner</a> is taking another stab at "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/reality">I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here</a>."</p>
      <p>The former Olympic athlete has joined the cast of the British version of the show, having starred in the U.S. version in 2003.</p>
      <p>Jenner, 70, will join broadcaster Ian Wright and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">singer Nadine Coyle</a> and more, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/itvpresscentre/status/1194020048719011841">a tweet from ITV</a>.</p>

      <p>“Dealing with other people is by far the hardest thing,” <a href="https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-packs/im-celebrityget-me-out-here-2019">Jenner said in a press release</a>. “It’s much more difficult than dealing with the most poisonous snakes in the world. That’s easy — just stay away from them!”</p>
      <p>The celebrities compete in various challenges in order to win money to go to a charity of their choosing.</p>

      <p>“Last time, I did it with a bunch of people from the States who I knew of," Jenner said of returning to the franchise. "This time, it’s a bunch of people from the U.K. who I potentially won’t know. But I love going over to the U.K., I love the British people and I am looking forward to making some new friends, new allies and getting through it all.”</p>
      <p>Jenner feels that she already has a place in the show, saying, “I am definitely a peacemaker and I do think I bring people together."</p>
      <p>While Jenner revealed that her daughters and former step-children have questioned her why she'd participate, she wishes she could bring one family member along: <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>.</p>
