      <p>HUDSON YARDS, Manhattan (WABC) -- Four construction workers were injured in Manhattan when a scaffold collapsed.</p>
      <p>The accident happened Monday morning on the 18th floor of a 58-story building under construction at the Hudson Yards site located at 415 10th Avenue.</p>
      <p>The Department of Buildings said that the cross-bracing on the scaffold was inadequate.</p>
      <p>The scaffold collapsed from the 18th to the 17th floor after a load of material was placed on it.</p>
      <p>None of the workers were seriously injured, and all four were taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>DOB inspectors ordered the contractor to repair the scaffolding and issued a violation for failure to safeguard workers.</p>
      <p>A partial stop work order was also issued.</p>
