      <h1>Thousands of fans illegally streamed KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 through a guy’s glasses</h1>

      <p>I guess you can say a lot of fans watched KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 through the eyes of someone else.</p>
      <p>Last Saturday’s main event between the two YouTube celebrities was behind the DAZN paywall in North America and Sky Box Office pay-per-view in the United Kingdom. Not everyone is necessarily willing to pony up the money to watch this fight, hence the murky but oft-explored world that is illegal streaming.</p>
      <p>Of all the creative ways to pirate content, this is one hell of an idea. A man who (presumably) legally streamed the fight through DAZN was able to, ahem, “share” the broadcast with at least 11,000 followers through the reflection of his glasses. I’m not making that up, there is actual evidence that this happened.</p>

      <p>“Don’t move bro” pretty much sums up the absurdity of it all.</p>
      <p>KSI won a split decision over Logan Paul in their highly anticipated rematch. If they were to have a trilogy, who knows what lengths people will go through to illegally stream a fight?</p>
