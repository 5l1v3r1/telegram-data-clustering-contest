      <h1>PSA: How To Help Animals During Bushfire Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T02:46:32+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 02:46</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Conaghan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/nsw-bushfires-scott-morrison/228886">Bushfire season</a> is well and truly upon us, and this year looks worse than most.</p>
      <p>There are no shortage of tragedies to come out of the recent bushfires, but news of an estimated 350 koalas being incinerated near Port Macquarie was particularly hard to stomach.</p>
      <p>During extreme weather events wildlife are also struggling — but there are easy things you can do to help.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology expects rainfall to be below average for the rest of the year, while daytime temperatures are likely to be warmer than average across most of Australia.</p>
      <p>These are just a few things you can do at home to help local wildlife through the extreme heat.</p>

      <p><b>Leave water out</b><br/>Fill up a shallow bowl and leave it in the shade, ideally near shrubs or trees. Make sure it is shallow so small birds do not become trapped and drown.</p>
      <p><b>Keep dogs and cats inside</b><br/>This will keep them out of the heat while allowing wildlife to access water safely.</p>
      <p><b>Cover your pool</b><br/>Animals trying to access water can drown in pools.</p>
      <p><b>Plant trees and shrubs</b><br/>This will create shade and shelter.</p>
      <p><b>Learn to identify heat-stressed animals</b><br/>Some signs include seeing nocturnal animals during the day, seeing tree-dwelling animals on the ground and seeing birds or animals displaying any loss of balance, collapse, confusion or panting.</p>
      <p><b>Prepare an emergency kit in case you spot heat-stressed wildlife</b><br/>Any emergency kit should include water, a blanket or towel, and a box.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If you find injured or distressed wildlife:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wrap them loosely in a towel, put them in a cardboard box and place it in a cool, quiet place. While you should definitely offer them water it’s best not to give them any food. Do not wrap heat-stressed animals in wet towels or submerse them in water.</p>
