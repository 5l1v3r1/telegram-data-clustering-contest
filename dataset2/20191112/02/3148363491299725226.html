      <h1>Judd Apatow Clashes with Joy Behar Over Who's 'Too Old' to Run for President</h1>
      <h2>Left-wing Hollywood director Judd Apatow clashed with host Joy Behar on ABC’s The View on Monday over whether a candidate can be “too old” to run for president.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T02:06:54+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 02:06</time> by <a rel="author">David Ng</a></address>
      <p>While Apatow is worried that candidates who are baby boomers or older might not have the mental stamina to serve as an effect commander-in-chief, Behar argued that age shouldn’t be an issue in the election.</p>
      <p>Their on-air spat comes as politicians in their 70s are dominating the Democratic field of presidential hopefuls.</p>
      <p>The party’s two frontrunners, Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA,) are 76 and 70, respectively. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is 78.</p>
      <p>Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is 77, though he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/08/michael-bloomberg-2020-campaign-would-skip-iowa-and-new-hampshire/">hasn’t officially announced his candidacy</a>.</p>

      <p>“I do worry about a very old president,” Apatow said on Tuesday’s show. “Because I don’t want a president that doesn’t have the energy. I’m 51. I still can’t find the fork in the drawer half the time. You know, I’m already goofy. I don’t know what I’m going to be like at 80.”</p>
      <p>Behar, 76, took objection to Apatow’s comments, noting that she’s the same age as Sen. Biden.</p>
      <p>“I total disagree with that. It’s ridiculous,” she said. “I’m the sage age as Joe Biden. Do I look like I don’t know what I’m doing?”</p>
      <p>She added: “I don’t see it as an issue. I really don’t.”</p>
      <p>Apatow replied: “You’re like a genetic mutation.”</p>
      <p><i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i> director has been a vehement critic of President Donald Trump, calling him a “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/10/28/judd-apatow-sniveling-lunatic-trump-turned-killing-al-baghdadi-into-a-reality-tv-show/">sniveling lunatic</a>” and a “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/06/25/judd-apatow-trump-is-a-nazi-the-debate-is-over/">Nazi supported by the Russians</a>.”</p>
      <p>Behar recently came under fire after she <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/11/07/joy-behar-to-audience-this-isnt-a-maga-rally/">lost her cool</a> when Donald Trump, Jr. appeared on <i>The View</i> last week and noted that Behar once dressed in blackface.</p>
      <p>The host denied on air that she has ever donned blackface, despite previously admitting that she once dressed as a “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/07/fact-check-joy-behar-denies-wearing-blackface-dressing-beautiful-african-woman/">beautiful African woman</a>” for Halloween.</p>
