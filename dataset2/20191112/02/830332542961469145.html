      <h2>Host had emergency surgery for blocked intestine</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - Pat Sajak tweeted for the first time since his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/entertainment/wheel-of-fortune-temporary-host-trnd/index.html">emergency surgery last week</a>.</p>
      <p>The "Wheel of Fortune" host underwent surgery Thursday for a blocked intestine, canceling a taping session for the show. Vanna White stepped in as host for Friday's taping.</p>
      <p>"I'm so grateful for all the good wishes during my recent illness," Sajak's tweet read. "Happy to say that the worst has passed, and I'll be out of the hospital in a day of two, then back to work (unless @TheVannaWhite has completely taken over!)"</p>
      <p>White said in a tweet the show without Sajak was like "a word without vowels."</p>
      <p>"I'll fill in the blanks until you return," White's tweet read. "Rest up and we'll be solving puzzles in no time. (Don't worry, your job is safe! Well, pretty safe.)"</p>
