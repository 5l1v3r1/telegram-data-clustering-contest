      <p>BERLIN (AP) — Authorities in Germany say they have detained three alleged supporters of the Islamic State group suspected of preparing an attack to kill “as many (…) unbelievers as possible.”</p>
      <p>Frankfurt prosecutors said some 170 police officers searched three apartments Tuesday in the nearby city of Offenbach and detained the men.</p>
      <p>Chief prosecutor Nadja Niesen said the main suspect, a 24-year-old German citizen with Macedonian roots, had already acquired materials needed to make explosives and searched for firearms online. Police seized various substances and devices at the man’s apartment.</p>
      <p>The other two suspects are Turkish citizens aged 21 and 22.</p>
      <p>All three suspects are alleged to have told witnesses in the past that they supported the Islamic State group.</p>
