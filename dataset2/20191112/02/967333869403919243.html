        <b>BRASILIA (Sputnik) - The parliament of Bolivia, where the situation in the country was discussed earlier on Monday, has been evacuated due to a new wave of unrest in La Paz, local newspaper Pagina 7 reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the newspaper, hundreds of armed supporters of President Evo Morales, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911101077274405-evo-morales-resigns-from-bolivian-presidency-amid-calls-from-military-police/">who resigned on Sunday</a>, took to the streets in protest, marching toward the national capital.</p>

      <p>The protesters actually completely destroyed the police station in the city of El Alto, adjacent to La Paz, it said. Some local shops have been closed.</p>
      <p>The video posted on social media shows how a crowd of armed people runs from El Alto to La Paz.</p>
      <p>Opposition politician Carlos Mesa asked the police for protection, believing that his house could be attacked.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the day, Bolivian Armed Forces Commander Williams Kaliman said that army units would participate in police operations against 'groups of vandals'.</p>
      <blockquote>"The military command ordered the start of joint operations with the Bolivian police to avoid bloodshed", Kaliman told reporters.</blockquote>
      <p>Kaliman stressed that the army would never open fire on civilians, and again called on the country's people to return to peace.</p>
      <p>Protests in the country sparked after Morales secured a new term in a hotly-contested presidential election. Peaceful rallies quickly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910221077112905-video-clashes-as-evo-morales-set-to-win-bolivian-presidential-election-without-second-round/">morphed into unrest</a> following a heavy-handed police response and incidents of arson and looting.</p>
