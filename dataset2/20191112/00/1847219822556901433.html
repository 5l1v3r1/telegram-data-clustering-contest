        <b>Latvia’s Procurement Monitoring Bureau (IUB) has prohibited Road Transport Directorate from continuing the procurement procedure without amendments and signing the contract for regional public transport services for 2021-2030, according to the decision made by IUB Submissions Review Committee.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The decision states that the Road Transport Directorate is to cancel the section of the tender On Fees for Entering Bus Stations, as well as the section On Technical Specifications that covers a requirement for contenders to provide disabled people the option to order a bus adapted for disabled people 24 hours prior to the trip. Additionally, Road Transport Directorate is asked to provide as detailed information as possible about the actual flow of passengers for each bus trip.</p>
      <p>IUB Submissions Committee has reviewed two applications from <i>SIA Sabiedriskais autobuss</i>, as well as applications from <i>SIA Tukuma auto</i>, <i>SIA Dobeles autobusu parks</i>, <i>AS CATA</i>, <i>SIA VTU Valmiera</i>, <i>SIA Jelgavas autobusu parks</i>, <i>SIA Jēkabpils autobusu parks</i>, <i>SIA Daugavpils autobusu parks</i>, <i>AS Nordeka</i> and <i>AS Talsu autotransports</i> about requirements of the tender.</p>
      <p>Complaints over more than 40 sections of the tender have been received.</p>
      <h3>The Submissions Review Committee declared most complaints as unjustified and some of them – partially justified.</h3>
      <p>The decision explains that the technical specifications section for Compulsory Requirements For Provision of Public Services, stating that contenders have to ensure all trips leave the starting point and move from stop to stop within a specific period of time, except for cases when the time spent on the road is affected by quality of the road, traffic congestion or other conditions independent of the contender’s power. This particular section states that contenders should state in their financial offer the fee for entering bus stations or other starting or end destinations. Additionally, costs should be stated for every year between 2021 and 2030.</p>
      <p>IUB explains that there is an ongoing dispute over the contenders’ inability to calculate and offer an accurately calculated service’s costs about provision of public transport services if costs are required to include fees for entering bus stations. Complaints from contenders mention it is not possible for them to acquire information about bus stations’ planned costs for services in the relevant time period. Respective, IUB has concluded that this section should be abolished from the tender.</p>
      <p>Additionally, one of the complaints is about Road Transport Directorate not providing information about the actual number of passengers for each trip each week day. Complaints mention that the requirements of the tender include information about expected passenger numbers without dividing information per day, adding that this information is not enough to objectively calculate how many passengers are needed for completion of bus trips. Submissions Review Committee found this complaint justified, adding that the Road Transport Directorate needs to include as detailed information as possible about actual number of passengers for each trip.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the committee believes the requirement from the Road Transport Directorate on contenders’ duty to ensure disabled persons are able to order a bus adapted for disabled people within 24 hours prior to the trip is unjustified, because in accordance with requirements of the Cabinet of Ministers, if the service provider does not have an adapted bus, the passenger has to put an order 72 hours prior to their trip.</p>
      <p>As it is known, the Road Transport Directorate announced a tender in summer On Provision of Rights for Bus Services on Regional Network of Routes. Multiple carriers have submitted complaints to IUB over requirements of this tender.</p>
