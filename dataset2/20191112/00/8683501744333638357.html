      <p>Since it’s part of the Disney empire… er, family, naturally there’ll be a lot of Marvel content that will be available on <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484336/last-minute-disney-questions-we-really-need-answered">the Disney+ streaming service</a>, including plenty of original series that’ll arrive in the coming years. That said, when it comes to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480886/wait-will-disney--include-mcu-deleted-scenes">Marvel Cinematic Universe movies</a>, it looked like Disney+ would be lacking in its offerings, but now official word’s come in that there will be a bigger selection of MCU cinematic tales available when Disney+ launches tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Per Disney’s announcement last month of literally all the Disney+ content that’ll be available on Day One, we already knew that <i>Iron Man</i>, <i>Iron Man 3</i>, <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>, <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, <i>Ant-Man</i>, <i>Captain Marvel</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> could be watched right off the bat (<i>Endgame</i> was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471495/avengers-endgame-already-has-a-disney-release-date">previously being saved for a December 11 drop</a>). Now thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1193985534927892480">a new Twitter thread</a>, eight more MCU movies have been added to the availability list:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Iron Man 2</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Thor</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i>
        <br/>
        <i>The Avengers</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Doctor Strange</i>
        <br/>
        <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So when combined with the previously announced movies, that adds up to 16 MCU movies you can stream to your heart’s content once Disney+ is up and running. That’s a much better lineup to choose from, but what about the remaining seven MCU movies that haven’t been accounted for?</p>
      <p>Well, when it comes to <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Black Panther</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>, those movies are still tied up by Disney’s previous deal with Netflix. So once that expires, then they’ll join the Disney+ lineup.</p>
      <p>Then there are <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>, <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i> and <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, with that first movie being distributed by Universal and the following two hailing from Sony. Those rights issues will make it difficult to ever include those movies on Disney+, although since <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483528/yes-disney-and-sonys-spider-man-compromise-was-due-to-the-fans">Disney and Sony were able to reach a new deal</a> that extends Tom Holland’s Spider-Man’s future in the MCU, maybe the two sides could reach an arrangement for the streaming service.</p>
      <p>In addition to the 16 MCU movies, Disney+ also announced a one-off special called <i>Expanding the Universe</i>. It’s described as “a new look at the original series coming to the service,” which include <i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i>, <i>WandaVision</i>, <i>Loki</i>, <i>Hawkeye</i>, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484382/kevin-feige-confirms-3-marvel-heroes-wholl-appear-in-mcu-movies-after-disney-shows"><i>Ms. Marvel</i>, <i>Moon Knight</i> and <i>She-Hulk</i>,</a> as well as <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476933/disneys-what-if-series-is-incredibly-liberating-for-marvel-studios-kevin-feige-says">the animated <i>What If… ?</i></a> The live action shows will be considered just as important to the MCU as the movies, so if you want enjoy this franchise to the fullest, you’ll want to keep up-to-date on what Disney+ is providing.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476948/Which-Marvel-Reveal-Is-The-Most-Exciting-Ahead-Of-Phase-4-CinemaBlend-Weighs-In">the MCU beginning Phase 4</a> next year with <i>Black Widow</i>, count on every MCU movie going forward to eventually be dropped on Disney+. Even if the service is never able to provide the full catalog of MCU stories, it’s definitely a destination worth visiting, whether you’re a diehard fan of the franchise or wanting to take your first steps with exploring it.</p>
