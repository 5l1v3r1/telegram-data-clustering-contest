        <b>«It is very hard to vote against popular things. In politics there will always be a situation when initiatives exceed abilities,» said chairman of Saeima’s Budget and Finance Committee Mārtiņš Bondars in an interview to <i>Latvijas Radio</i>, commenting on the approval of the country’s budget for 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>«Saeima deputies want more than what the state budget can accommodate. This is normal,» said the politician, stressing that the budget approval process is going normally and not everyone is happy with all budget approval steps.</p>
      <p>He also mentioned that he is experienced in politics and knows his way around. However, he is not educated in medicine and does not wish to teach doctors how to treat patients.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the phrase «it is silly to adopt laws impossible to follow!», which Bondars said himself on Monday, 12 November, at a meeting of the Saeima Budget and Finance Committee, the politician said that by approving laws, such as the one of increase of healthcare budget, politicians have put themselves in an uncomfortable situation. Currently they make decisions about expenditures, not revenue.</p>

      <p>Bondars is confident the decision-making process is not correct. He also mentions – were there no such order, it is possible increase of funding for healthcare would not be as big as it is now.</p>
      <p>According to Bondars, Saeima always promises more money, which is normal for politics.</p>
      <p>The politician denied approval of the 2020 budget should be postponed, because otherwise it will be necessary to work with a lower economic growth outlook, which means budget cuts would be even larger.</p>
