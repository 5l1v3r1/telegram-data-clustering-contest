      <p>Never before in the Premier League era have Liverpool found themselves in such a strong position. The eight-point lead they hold at the top of the table is their biggest since the 1989/90 season, the last time the Reds lifted the league title. It is also the joint-largest (with Ligue 1) gap between first and second in any of Europe’s top five divisions and yet a title race is still being spoken of in England.Sunday’s clash with Manchester City presented Jurgen Klopp and his players with a crossroads in their campaign, and maybe in their history as potential Liverpool legends. Defeat would have closed the gap at the top of the Premier League to just three points and raked up familiar insecurities over the Reds’ historic struggles to get over the line.</p>
      <p>Victory, though, saw them confirm their superiority over the defending champions. Were Liverpool any other team, any other club, they would have been tagged runaway leaders and champions-elect by now. It’s only because they have failed to make this sort of advantage count in the past that many are holding off on tying the red ribbons on the Premier League trophy.</p>

      <p>There is no reasonable evidence to suggest this Liverpool team will allow the ghosts of the past to haunt them, though. As demonstrated countless times over the past two years in particular, there is a mental strength to Klopp’s side as well as a consistent trend of incremental progress and development over a prolonged period of time.</p>
      <p>Look at how close Liverpool got to winning the Champions League in 2018, losing to Real Madrid in the final, only to make a similar run 12 months later, this time lifting the trophy with a win over Tottenham in Madrid. Having come so close to winning the Premier League title last season, finishing second with an astonishing 97 points, the precedent is there for Liverpool to take the final step this season. </p>
      <p>Under Klopp, Liverpool have become European football’s model club. Their improvement over the past four years has been total with pretty much every area of the club in better shape than it was at the time of the German’s arrival. From recruitment to youth development, results to fan relations, the Reds have arguably never been stronger, at least not in recent memory.</p>
      <p>Of course, Klopp can only be credited with so much of that improvement. Without the backing of Fenway Sports Group (FSG) and the staff at executive and boardroom level, he would have faced many of the same problems his predecessors experienced. Things have come together at the right time for the Anfield club. </p>

      <p>It would take an almighty collapse from this point for Liverpool to finish the season without the Premier League trophy in their hands. Chelsea and Leicester City are both building momentum, but it will surely be too much for either of them to close the eight-point gap on the Reds. Given Man City’s recent struggles, it doesn’t seem likely that they will be able to make up nine points on Klopp and his men.</p>
      <p>If Paris Saint-Germain are seen as nailed on title winners in France, holding an eight-point lead at the top of Ligue 1, then Liverpool should be regarded in the same way in the Premier League. Of course, England’s top flight is a lot stronger all the way through than Ligue 1 is, but Liverpool’s supremacy over the rest is proven, winning 11 of the 12 fixtures they have played this season. Nobody can touch them.</p>
      <p>The ‘It’s Our Year’ proclamation made by Liverpool fans more than once over the past three decades has become meme-worthy. Indeed, Reds supporters are now much more wary in making such statements, but there’s no real reason for them to be. If Liverpool’s Premier League title challenge falls apart, it will do so against logic.</p>
