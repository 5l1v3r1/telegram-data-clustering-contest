      <p>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) - Jury selection is underway in Great Falls in the case against Brandon Lee Craft, who is charged with killing a disabled veteran in February 2016 and burying his body on property outside of the city.</p>
      <p>Craft is charged with deliberate homicide in the February 2016 death of Adam Petzack. Petzack was reported missing in June 2016. His body was found two months later on property Craft had rented. Petzack had been shot.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors alleged Craft and his now ex-wife took $1,400 in disability payments deposited into Petzack’s bank account before he was reported missing. Katelyn Craft has pleaded guilty to felony deceptive practices and has agreed to disclose information about Petzack’s killing.</p>
