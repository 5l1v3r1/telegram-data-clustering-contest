      <h1>The Future Of Food Goes Far Beyond What We Like And How It Tastes - Podcast With Vegan Pioneer Miyoko Schinner</h1>

      <p>Compassion, centric food choices may well be the future for the food industry. In a world where we are increasingly aware of the environment for food production and associated habitat loss, we are forced to increasingly become compassionate about the consequences of food for our planet. What is on our plate has consequences. Yes, we might like it, yes, it might be good for us. But now we have to think beyond our personal health to the planet. For example, six times as much eat is being eaten in China in 2019 than in 1990. This is unsustainable for us in the USA and across the world.</p>

      <p>Younger generations (Millennial and Alpha) are increasingly voting with their wallets so much so that vegan-based kinds of milk are likely to be 50% of what is available at stores in less than five years. Miyoko believes dairy itself may not exist in two decades or so as these new consumers change what we have in our stores. Major food companies are recognizing this (Tysons is now a protein company). Still, the ecosystems behind them (farmers) are severely disadvantaged in this process, and we need to help them transform themselves to be ready for the future of food.</p>

      <p>Experimentation with few forms of vegan products made from mushrooms and Garbonzo teams still lay ahead of an exciting transformation of what we produce and eat. While we will clearly get to and past the traditional tipping point for when something becomes mainstream (10%) way before 2029, there are great lessons to be learned from Miyoko's, about putting big mission statements and leadership actions into place during periods of dramatic change and that is something we can all learn from.</p>
