      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Uber subsidiary Jump is fighting the suspension of its permit to rent electric scooters and bikes in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The city suspended Jump’s operating permit in October for not complying with a rule requiring such companies to transmit data on the start and end point of each trip in real time and share the route taken within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The data-sharing rule is included in LA’s pilot permit program for electric scooter and bike rentals.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles Times reports Tuesday that Jump has filed a request for a hearing that will determine whether it will have to remove its scooters and bikes from the city.</p>
