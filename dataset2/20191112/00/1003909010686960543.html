      <h1>Calgarians gather to remember sacrifices on Remembrance Day</h1>

      <p>Thousands of Calgarians attended Remembrance Day ceremonies across the city Monday morning to pay their respects to Canadian veterans.</p>
      <p>The annual Remembrance Day ceremony at Central Memorial Park featured a parade with the Calgary Highlanders, Calgary’s infantry army reserve unit made up of “citizen soldiers,” followed by a wreath-laying ceremony.</p>
      <p>The Calgary Highlanders have a record of service in both world wars, in NATO operations and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>It was one of <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/lest-we-forget-calgary-remembrance-day-ceremonies-listings">more than a dozen official ceremonies</a> across Calgary, including those at the Field of Crosses, the Hangar Flight Museum, the Military Museums, CP’s Memorial Square in Ogden and Fort Calgary.</p>

      <p>“It’s nice to see large crowds,” said Keith Purdy, who served as a medic in the Canadian Forces during the 1980s.</p>
      <p>“This is probably the most important day of the year for most of us in Canada to show respect for all the people that fought in wars and were killed and wounded.”</p>
      <p>Now more than a century since the end of the First World War, many veterans in attendance said it’s refreshing to see the importance of teaching about, and commemorating, the sacrifices made by Canada’s veterans has not been lost.</p>
      <p>“It means there is a recognition of the fact that people have gone out and paid the ultimate price to support a cause that we all benefit from,” said Master Cpl. (Ret.) Rick Bethune, who served for 22 years beginning in 1973.</p>
      <p>But “until you’ve been there and done that you won’t really have a really firm grasp of the concept,” he added.</p>

      <p>Purdy, who comes from a long-standing military family going back to the First World War — he also has uncles who served in the Second World War — said he was proud to follow in his family’s footsteps.</p>
      <p>“I feel it’s my duty and my honour,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said each Remembrance Day is more meaningful than the last.</p>

      <p>“Hopefully we don’t have to go through this again in the future. I know the world is in a state now that is very different than it was even 10 years ago and, with everything going on, I think it’s important that we stand strong,” said Purdy.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little more poignant now that we’re getting older. We’re not going to be here forever and it’s nice to see all the young people out.”</p>
