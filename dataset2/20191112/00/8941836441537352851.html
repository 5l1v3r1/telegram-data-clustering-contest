      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - Eddie Stansberry matched his career high with 26 points and Drew Buggs added 13 with the clinching free throws with six seconds left and Hawaii defeated Pacific 72-67 on Monday night to close the round-robin Rainbow Classic.</p>
      <p>After Jeremiah Bailey hit a 3-pointer to pull the Tigers within one, a foul and a technical foul sent Stansberry to the line for a pair of free throws for a 70-67 lead. Then it was Buggs with the clinchers.</p>
      <p>Neither team led by more than eight points. Pacific was up that many with under four minutes to go when Stansberry and Samuta Avea drained 3-pointers and then Stansberry’s four-point play with 1:37 to go put the Rainbows up 64-62. Justin Moore tied it with two free throws but Zigmars Raimo made a layup and then Stansberry made two free throws with 20 seconds to play.</p>
      <p>Stansberry, who was 7-of-10 shooting with four 3-pointers, had 17 points in the second half. The Rainbow Warriors (2-1) went 10 of 23 from distance.</p>
      <p>Amari McCray led Pacific (2-2) with 16 points and Moore had 14. The Tigers were outscored by 10 at the foul line.</p>
