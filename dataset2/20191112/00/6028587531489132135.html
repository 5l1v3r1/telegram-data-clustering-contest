      <p>During last night's People's Choice Awards, E! announced that it will bring back talk show <i>The Soup</i> following a four-year break in early 2020. Actress and comedian Jade Catta-Preta will be the host."We're excited to bring this beloved franchise back to the network, with a new take on an old favorite," said EVP, Production and Development, Oxygen &amp; Production, E! Rod Aissa. "Jade's quick wit and keen observations will provide a much-needed voice in today's pop culture landscape delivered in a way that only <i>The Soup</i> can."</p>
      <p>Here is the promo for the revival:</p>
      <p>The first iteration of the show, which aired on the network from 1991 through 2002, was called <i>Talk Soup </i>and helped launch the career of Greg Kinnear, the host through 1995. Each episode featured footage from the previous day’s talk shows alongside fun, comedic commentary by the host. John Henson took over after Kinnear through 1999, followed by Hal Sparks (through 2000) and Aisha Tyler (through 2002).</p>
      <p><i>The Soup</i>, a revamped version of the original, aired between 2004 and 2015 on E!. Joel McHale was the host. Following the cancellation, McHale brought <i>The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale</i>—essentially, a revived <i>The Soup</i>—to Netflix. The show was cancelled after a single season, which begs the question: is there still an audience for <i>The Soup</i>?</p>
