      <h1>The Elizabeth Warren Shorts: For-Profit Education And For-Profit Prisons</h1>

      <p>Stock prices are already being affected by the movement of Senator Warren’s presidential candidacy in the betting markets and national polls. While the S&amp;P 500 has been making new all-time highs recently, as President Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1191371996459884549">likes</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192071660494565377">remind</a> us on Twitter, investors are exiting the two sectors that would be very negatively affected by a President Warren: for-profit education and for-profit prisons. We can see this very clearly in the relative returns of for-profit education and for-profit prison stocks against the S&amp;P 500 since mid-late August, when Senator Warren took the lead in the betting markets.Senator Warren broke out of the pack on betting site <a href="https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3633/Who-will-win-the-2020-Democratic-presidential-nomination">PredictIt</a> in mid-August. </p>

      <p>Recent Iowa polling puts her at number one in that state, and a solid number two, behind former vice-president Joe Biden, across national polls, according to agglomerated poll data on <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/democratic_nomination_polls/">RealClear Politics</a>. </p>
      <p>Using <a href="https://sentieo.com/">Sentieo’s</a> Alexa web traffic data integration, we see Senator Warren’s campaign site being consistently the top site in terms of page views versus the other two top candidates’ sites (based on the betting leaders). We are using a 30-day moving average for smoothing. </p>

      <p>We see a similar dynamic in Twitter mentions. Mentions of @ewarren, the Senator’s Twitter handle, have been leading for most of the last six months. Again, we are using a 30-day moving average for smoothing. </p>

      <p><a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans">Senator Warren’s platform</a> is very comprehensive, with about 60 issues discussed in great detail. </p>
      <p>We reviewed two of these, “<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/end-private-prisons">End Private Prisons</a>” (originally published on June 21, 2019) and “<a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/affordable-higher-education">Affordable Higher Education for All</a>” (originally published on April 22, 2019)</p>
      <p>Senator Warren’s plan for private prisons is clear across the board, from federal agencies down to the states.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“</i>
        <b>
          <i>Ban private prisons and detention facilities. </i>
        </b>
        <i>There should be no place in America for profiting off putting more people behind bars or in detention. That’s why I will shut down the use of federal private detention facilities by ending all contracts that the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service have with private detention providers. And I will extend these bans to states and localities by conditioning their receipt of federal public safety funding on their use of public facilities.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>In the Higher Education plan, Senator Warren’s team minces no words about the for-profit higher ed actors:</p>

      <p>The Warren plan for the for-profit colleges is also fairly clear:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“After an appropriate transition period,</i>
        <b>
          <i> ban for-profit colleges from receiving any federal dollars</i>
        </b>
        <i> (including military benefits and federal student loans), so they can no longer use taxpayer dollars to enrich themselves while targeting lower-income students, service members, and students of color and leaving them saddled with debt.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>We are seeing the uncertainty picking up steam in corporate filings with the SEC. For example, Corecivic noted the gathering clouds in its latest 10-Q filing, with this insert regarding banks pulling back on financing private prison operators. </p>

      <p>With the possibility of federal funding being pulled in both cases, investors are taking notice. </p>
      <p>We built a basket of for-profit prisons (CXW, CoreCivic fka Corrections Corporation of America, and GEO, The Geo Group) and several for-profit education stocks (ATGE Adtalem, formerly DeVry, CECO Career Education Corp., LAUR Laureate Education, LOPE Grand Canyon Education, and STRA, Strategic Education, formerly Strayer Education.)</p>
      <p>We then plotted the total returns (stock prices and dividends) of that equal-weighted basket of equities against the broader market’s total return.</p>

      <p>We can clearly see the “break” in August of the relative returns of our equal-weighted basket of “Warren shorts” against the broad market (using the SPY S&amp;P500 ETF here). We expect that this group of stocks will continue to trade more of the polls and headlines (vs the fundamentals), creating opportunities for investors over the next several months. </p>
