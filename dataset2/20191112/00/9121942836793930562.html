      <p>MOSCOW (AP) — The former leader of Kazakhstan says he has offered to host a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The fighting between Russia-backed separatist rebels and Ukrainian troops in Ukraine’s industrial east has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.</p>
      <p>Nursultan Nazarbayev, said Tuesday he suggested that the leaders of Russia and Ukraine meet in his country. He said he had spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who reacted positively.</p>
      <p>Nazarbayev added that he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Zelenskiy is ready for a meeting, but he didn’t say how Putin reacted.</p>
      <p>Although Nazarbayev stepped down as president last year, he still wields considerable influence in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany also have discussed a possible four-way meeting on settling the conflict. No date has been set yet.</p>
