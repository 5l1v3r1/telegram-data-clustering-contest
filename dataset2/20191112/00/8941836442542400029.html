      <p>AMES, Iowa (AP) - Authorities have released the name of a man who was injured in a fall from the upper level of Iowa State’s Jack Trice Stadium onto fans below.</p>
      <p>A university police report says 31-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-ely/">Eric Ely</a> hit three women on the lower level during the Oct. 26 game against Oklahoma State. None of them suffered serious injuries, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-ely/">Ely</a> reported that he briefly lost consciousness and suffered a concussion. He was taken to an Ames hospital before being flown to a Des Moines hospital.</p>
      <p>The report says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-ely/">Ely</a> “jumped up during a big play and just went over the rail in one movement; like the momentum carried him over.” Witnesses told investigators that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-ely/">Ely</a> didn’t appear to be intoxicated.</p>
