      <p>What might happen if you opened your heart to homeless strangers? In 2009, high school teacher Kristi Blakeway decided to do just that with her students. The name of the idea was called “Project Hello,” and the positive impact has been overflowing ever since.</p>
      <p>The idea was simple: find a way in which to help the homeless not by giving out more handouts, clothing, money or gifts, but by providing them with the chance to tell their story. Give the homeless a voice.</p>
      <p>And it wasn’t just any homeless; Blakeway and the students chose Canada’s most impoverished neighborhood, Vancouver’s infamous Downtown Eastside. Of Vancouver’s <a href="https://www.vancourier.com/news/vancouver-s-record-breaking-homeless-population-at-2-223-people-1.23853962">2,223 people</a> classified as homeless, the vast majority live in the Downtown Eastside.</p>
      <p>It’s described by the city’s official website as “one of Vancouver's oldest neighborhoods, and the historic heart of the city.” Within six blocks, it’s also home to a plethora of complex challenges, including drug use, crime, housing issues, sexual abuse, unemployment, and a growing loss of businesses. To travel through the streets is to be whisked through the very antithesis of Douglas Coupland’s glamorous book that depicts Vancouver as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Glass_(Coupland_book)"><i>City of Glass</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the Downtown Eastside (known as DTES) possesses a disproportionate level of extreme marginalization and poverty compared to the rest of Vancouver. Long a home to those with addictions and mental health issues, it is also a place known for its flagrant, almost incalculable stigma. It needs a break. The homeless who reside there could use a hug.</p>
      <p>Enter Kristi Blakeway and her students.</p>
      <p>When the first iteration of the project started ten years ago, I recall chatting with Kristi about it. Her level of exuberance and pure passion for the initiative was palpable. Five years later, the project morphed from helping the homeless reach out to loved ones to genuinely listening to their stories, finding ways to share them.</p>
      <p>Ten years later and after hundreds of hours of conversations, Blakeway has just published a book. It’s a fantastic, heartfelt read that will remind you of the critical importance of dialogue, communication and compassion.</p>
      <p>Titled <i>Beyond Hello: Rekindling the Human Spirit One Conversation at a Time</i>, Blakeway’s book provides not only incredible insights into the Project Hello and Beyond Hello ideas, she lovingly details many of the stories and people she met over the ten years. At times there is a raw reality with what she has witnessed.</p>
      <p>Take, for example, an encounter Kristi and her students witnessed with a shirtless, barefoot man who was in the middle of a drug-induced rage of excited delirium.</p>
      <h3>“He grabbed hold of my arm and mocked me, ‘You don’t feel comfortable? How do you think I feel?’ He held my arm with a firm grip, and I froze for a second, not sure what to do next. Without hesitation, I heard the woman from the doorway yell, ‘Here—take my drugs. Take it all!’ She opened her pockets and gave him everything she had. He released my arm, happy to victimize someone else, and ran up the street. The woman sitting in the doorway smiled at me and apologized, ‘Sorry about that. What a jerk. I don’t even know him.’ She may not have known him, but she knew how to survive on the streets and how to keep me safe.”</h3>
      <p>Blakeway goes on to write that this was only one of a couple of instances across the hundreds of times she has spent time in the DTES chatting with the homeless where she felt unsafe. The book is not about the horrors; it is one that details with sublime care the importance of love and empathy.</p>
      <p>Among the dozens of personal stories and heartfelt anecdotes lies one that introduces us to Leonard, a 51-year old homeless man who “no longer jaywalks since being hit by a car, no longer steals since his grandmother gave him words to live by, and no longer wants to be judged because of his past.”</p>
      <p>Blakeway and her students walked with Leonard in search of milkshakes. Throughout the walk, she asked questions about his background, how he ended up in the DTES, and if he’d ever leave. We discover that he’s been in prison, his girlfriend, murdered, and he considers himself the “black sheep” of the family. Leonard even got denied an invitation to the funeral of his brother.</p>
      <p>Unfamiliar with Facebook, Kristi effortlessly finds the pages of Leonard’s two sisters and shows him pictures of the two women and their families. He tears up, asking her to send them messages on his behalf. She obliges.</p>
      <p>They never found the milkshakes, but Kristi did find a place for lunch. After paying, she asks one final question. What does he wish the world knew about him? The answer is compelling.</p>
      <h3>“What I wish? Wishing is witchcraft. I don’t believe in wishes. But I do believe in blessings, and my grandmother reminded me I am blessed, and I will see that in my 40’s or 50’s. I am 51 now, and I am not who I used to be. I don’t fight, I don’t steal, and I collect cans. I am blessed.”</h3>
      <p>Stories like that of Leonard drape the pages of <i>Beyond Hello</i>.
