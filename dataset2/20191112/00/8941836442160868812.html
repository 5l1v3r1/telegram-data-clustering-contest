      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mazie-hirono/">Sen. Mazie Hirono</a> of Hawaii, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/">Senate</a>’s first Asian American woman and only current immigrant, is working on a memoir.</p>
      <p>Viking announced Tuesday that the book, currently untitled, will come out in 2021.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mazie-hirono/">Hirono</a>, 72, will write about emigrating at age 8 to the United States after her mother fled an abusive marriage in Japan. In a statement issued through Viking, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mazie-hirono/">Hirono</a> said the book was a tribute to her mother’s spirit.</p>
      <p>“My deep emotional connection to my mother, a remarkable woman who made a hard choice to save her children, and who valiantly struggled to care for us as a single parent, is the current that has driven my entire life,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mazie-hirono/">Hirono</a> said in a statement. “Now, because she can no longer bear witness for herself, I am choosing to bear witness on her behalf by telling the story of the daughter she inspired to live boldly and to fight for the promises of this country.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mazie-hirono/">Hirono</a>, a Democrat, is currently serving her second term in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/">Senate</a>. She made news last year as a leading critic of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual harassment and attempted assault. Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed, denied the allegations.</p>
