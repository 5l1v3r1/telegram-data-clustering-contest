      <p>The San Francisco 49ers found themselves in a dog fight against the Seattle Seahawks on Monday night. In need of a win to move to 9-0 on the season, San Francisco opened up an early 10-0 lead before Seattle scored a defensive touchdown to pull the game within 10-7. That’s when 49ers safety Jaquiski Tartt made one of the best defensive plays of the season, forcing a Seahawks fumble at the goal line late in the second quarter. And so started one of the best games of the NFL season.</p>
      <p>In the end, San Francisco could not overcome its own mistakes and play calling. The team dropped its first game of the season in an epic 27-24 Seahawks win in overtime. These are among the biggest takeaways from the game.</p>
      <h3>Play Calling Doomed 49ers In Overtime</h3>
      <p>San Francisco took over with about 90 seconds left in the extra stanza. Seattle did not have a single timeout remaining. Head coach Kyle Shanahan could have called one running play to make sure that the game either ended in a tie or a 49ers win. Instead, he had a shaky Jimmy Garoppolo throw three times. That included a drop by Dante Pettis and a long incomplete pass down the field.</p>
      <p>San Francisco ultimately gave the ball back to the Seahawks after less than 30 seconds of game time. The rest was history, as MVP front runner Russell Wilson led Seattle down for the game-winning field goal.</p>
      <p>We understand that Shanahan wanted the win. However, a tie here would have benefited the 49ers a lot more than Seattle. They would have still been two games up on their division counterparts in the loss column. Shanahan needed to know the situation at hand.</p>
      <h3>Receivers Need To Catch The Ball</h3>
      <p>Once Emmanuel Sanders went down with an injury in the first half, it became apparent that Garoppolo didn’t trust his receivers. For good reason. Kendrick Bourne had an absurd drop in the third quarter that led directly to a Seahawks touchdown. Bourne dropped at least one more pass. Fellow youngster Dante Pettis had multiple drops, including on second down in overtime before the 49ers went three-and-out.</p>
      <p>While he had a pretty good overall game, rookie receiver Deebo Samuel also caught a case of the dropsies. It was pretty much all the 49ers caught Monday evening at Levi’s Stadium. And in reality, this likely cost them the game.</p>
      <p>The hope here is that Sanders’ injury is not too serious. Simply put, the San Francisco 49ers’ offense looks like a completely different monster with their newly-acquired receiver in the mix.</p>
      <h3>Defense Came To Play</h3>
      <p>Look at it this way. Seattle scored a total of six points on long fields against the 49ers Monday night. The three of the touchdowns Russell Wilson and Co. scored all came after turnovers, two Garoppolo fumbles and an interception.</p>
      <p>Seattle did not have to drive any more than 24 yards on the two touchdowns its offense scored. The third touchdown came on a strip sack of Garoppolo.</p>
      <p>The two field goals that Seattle scored came on drives of less than 50 yards.</p>
      <p>That’s been the issue for these 49ers at times this season. If their offense forces opposing teams to go the length of the field, it’s proven to be futile. When opposing offenses get short fields, that’s the only time they’ve had success against the NFL’s best defense.</p>
      <h3>Couldn’t Overcome Injuries</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s really that simple. Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle missed Monday night’s game with an injury to both his ankle and knee. Despite getting three offensive starters back into the mix, Emmanuel Sanders exited in the first half with a rib injury and didn’t return.</p>
      <p>On the defensive side of the ball, defensive tackle D.J. Jones exited in the first half to injury. This came after he put up an impressive sack of Russell Wilson earlier in the game.</p>
      <p>And in what could have been a deciding factor, Pro Bowl kicker Robbie Gould had to sit this out. In his stead, un-drafted kicker Chase McLaughlin nailed his first three field goals before missing horribly on what would have been a game winner in overtime.</p>
      <p>A team that has dealt with myriad injuries this season simply couldn’t overcome the injury bug on Monday night. It’s not to make excuses. It’s just the reality of the situation.</p>
      <h3>Offensive Tackles Struggle</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>We fully understand that Mike McGlinchey and Joe Staley were making their first appearances after extensive absences. However, neither one came to play in a game against one of the weakest pass rushes in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Garoppolo was sacked five time and hit a total of 10 times in the game. Jadeveon Clowney absolutely dominated at every turn. It led to Garoppolo getting happy feet in the backfield. That coupled with struggles from 49ers receivers pretty much doomed the team.</p>
      <p>Both of these top-end tackles are going to have to play better moving forward. They simply did not have it on Monday night. That has to be concerning.</p>
      <h3>Injury Updates</h3>
      <p>Multiple 49ers players will be getting MRIs conducted on Tuesday to confirm the extent of their injuries. Emmanuel Sanders will get an MRI on his rib injury. D.J. Jones is dealing with a groin injury. Meanwhile, Ronald Blair suffered a knee injury in the second half. He was seen with a brace on after the game and was getting hugs from teammates in the locker room.</p>
      <p>On a short week, it will be interesting to see what comes from these test results. That’s the biggest takeaway from a game that saw the 49ers lose for the first time all season.</p>
      <h3>Preview Of Things To Come</h3>

      <p>Monday night’s game started a difficult stretch over the next month plus that includes outings against the Packers, Ravens and Saints. It was the first real opportunity for San Francisco to prove itself as the absolute powerhouse in the NFC.</p>
      <p>While the team did end up falling short, there’s a lot of good to take away from this game. It took three 49ers turnovers on their own end of the field and a missed field goal in overtime for Seattle to depart Santa Clara with the win.</p>
      <p>More than anything, this epic rivalry game sets up a Week 17 outing between the 49ers and Seahawks in Seattle that could decide the NFC West and potential home-field advantage in the playoffs. The football world needs that to happen after what we saw from both teams at Levi’s Stadium.</p>
