      <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cyprus/">Cyprus</a>‘ Orthodox Christian Church says it’s ready to give back a fugitive Malaysian financier’s 310,000-euro ($342,000) donation if a probe into wealthy individuals who were granted a Cypriot passport under a lucrative investment program finds that he broke eligibility rules and is stripped of citizenship.</p>
      <p>The church said Tuesday it accepted the donation because it was deemed above-board since vetting procedures at the time found no wrongdoing that would deny Low Taek Jho citizenship.</p>
      <p>European Union member <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cyprus/">Cyprus</a> has said it’s moving to strip 26 individuals of citizenship following media reports suggesting that some investors had questionable backgrounds and should not have received passports. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cyprus/">Cyprus</a> has since toughened eligibility rules.</p>
