      <p>OCRACOKE, N.C. (AP) - County commissioners on the North Carolina coast have moved to reopen an island ravaged by Hurricane Dorian.</p>
      <p>Acting on a recommendation from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ocracoke-control-group/">Ocracoke Control Group</a>, the Hyde County Commissioners on Monday adopted the proposal to open the island to visitors on Nov. 22, or when N.C. Highway 12 is reopened to traffic.</p>
      <p>An evacuation order has been in effect since Sept. 4, when Dorian approached the North Carolina coast.</p>
      <p>According to a news release, once the evacuation order is lifted, visitors will have immediate access to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ocracoke-control-group/">Ocracoke</a>. Ferry operations will return to the paid reservation system.</p>
