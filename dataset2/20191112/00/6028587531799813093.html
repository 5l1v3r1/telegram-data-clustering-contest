      <p>In 2018, female founders generated $26.3 billion when they exited their companies either through acquisitions or IPOs, according to the new PitchBook and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/video/5982221479001/#79cf2c1f601c">All Raise</a> report,<i> </i><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/2019-pitchbook-all-raise-all-in-women-in-the-vc-ecosystem"><i>Women in the VC Ecosystem</i></a>. Female-founded companies are gaining market share and accounted for 14% of last year’s exits. Although the percentage is slim, companies with at least one female founder are getting there faster. The report found that on average, these companies exit in 6.4 years while entirely male founded startups exit in 7.4. It is a promising sign for investors because it means they are getting a return on investment. This is yet another case study for why investing in female-founded companies often <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/05/20/venture-capital-gender-gap/">boosts the bottom line</a>. A 2018 Boston Consulting Group <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet.aspx">study</a> looked at 350 startups in the Boston area and found that even though women raised less than half as much money as their male counterparts, they earned 78 cents per dollar invested compared to 31 cents for the men. A 2018 McKinsey &amp; Company <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/organization/our%20insights/delivering%20through%20diversity/delivering-through-diversity_full-report.ashx">report</a> found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams were 21% more likely to experience above-average profits.</p>
      <p>The PitchBook and All Raise report had more findings about the state of venture capital funding in 2018. The number of investments in startups led by women has increased every year, and last year there was an all-time high of 3,477 investments. To put it into perspective, there were just 583 deals in 2009 and 823 in 2010. The amount of money invested in female-founded startups has also consistently increased — female founders raised a record $46.3 billion in 2018. That’s a more than 15-fold increase from the $3 billion raised in 2010. Yet it’s just a fraction of the $130.9 billion that all U.S. based startups raised last year, according to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/media/press-releases/us-venture-capital-investment-reached-1309-billion-in-2018-surpassing-dot-com-era">PitchBook</a>.</p>
      <p>The report attributes the trajectory to a variety of factors, including awareness of gender imbalance, stronger mentorship networks for female founders and an increase in the number of female venture capitalists. Still, 88% of the decision-makers are men. “Given studies that emphasize how female VC partners are twice as likely to invest in startups with at least one female founder and more than three times as likely to back startups with female CEOS, the discrepancy at the funder level is critical in this equation,” Pam Kostka, the CEO of All Raise, said in the <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_All_Raise_2019_All_In_Women_in_the_VC_Ecosystem.pdf">report</a>. There is also correlation between the number of female decision-makers and fund performance. Of all of the U.S. top-quartile venture capital firms from 2009 to 2018, 69.2% had women decision-makers. </p>
      <p>This is good news for the growing number of female-founded funds that invest in female founders, such as Halogen Ventures, Forerunner Ventures, SoGal Ventures, Female Founders Fund and BBG Ventures. Just like it is harder for female founders to raise funding, it is also harder for these female venture capitalists to raise capital. This new report is promising because it indicates a strong correlation between female founded companies and strong returns. Most of the capital in the venture ecosystem is managed by limited partners and they are more likely to fund venture capital firms that have a solid track record</p>
      <p>Although the venture capital gender gap is closing, there is still a long way to go. In 2018, just 20.3% of all deals and 17.9% of funding went to companies with at least one female founder. So far this year, 88.8% of all venture capital deals have gone to companies with a male CEO.</p>
