      <h1>Investors Beware, Special Incentives For Aramco IPO Could Cause A Bubble</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ellen R. Wald</a></address>
      <p>As Saudi Aramco and the Saudi Arabian government proceed with the Aramco IPO after almost four years of talk, there are increasing signs that their policies will likely produce a bubble. Unlike some famous bubbles in the past, such as the Dutch tulip bulb mania in the seventeenth century, this bubble will be largely the result of company and government decisions. Surely, citizens of Saudi Arabia and some investment institutions are excited to get their hands on Aramco shares — it is the most profitable company in the world — but the government’s eagerness to sell the stock will likely lead to an artificially high price which cannot last.</p>

      <p>There have been several reports that the Saudi government is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9fe2862-dada-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">pushing</a> wealthy Saudis to invest large amounts. It is important for foreigners to understand that in an absolute monarchy like Saudi Arabia, when the king’s government pushes a citizen to do something, that citizen will almost definitely comply. As these wealthy Saudis buy Aramco stocks, the value will rise. But will they hold Aramco stocks or will they be allowed and able to sell at some point? If they sell, that could precipitate a bubble burst.</p>
      <p>It has been decided that, “Certain Saudi retail investors who continuously and uninterruptedly hold their shares for 180 days will receive one bonus share for every ten shares they purchase in the offering, up to a maximum of 100 bonus shares.” (Note: This information, which is now available in the Aramco IPO <a href="https://www.saudiaramco.com/-/media/images/investors/saudi-aramco-prospectus-cma-en.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=8887077F5ACCE26916E6DA8A953B44771D0C46F1">prospectus</a>, was first provided on the <a href="https://www.saudiaramco.com/en/ipo/contacts-and-faq">Aramco website</a> but was expressly not intended for people accessing the site from certain locations outside of Saudi Arabia, including the United States—but it is available in English).</p>
      <p>Essentially, there is an effort to incentivize “certain Saudi retail investors” to hold their shares after they buy. Oftentimes, retail investors buy shares early at an IPO and try to flip them as the price rises. The Saudi government and Aramco want to avoid that, hence the creation of a way to pay investors to hold shares for six months. But what happens after six months? Will many people sell their shares as soon as the incentive period over? If so, the likely scenario is that the price will begin to drop — perhaps by a lot.</p>

      <p>It is essential for foreign investors considering investing in Aramco to keep an eye on this and other incentives from Saudi Arabia designed to prop up Aramco’s share price. There are still rumors and hints that at some point Aramco will be listed on a non-Saudi exchange, perhaps <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-ipo-japan-exchange/tokyo-bourse-owner-feels-saudi-aramco-ipo-plans-intact-jiji-idUSL3N26H18B">Tokyo</a>. Moreover, Aramco and Saudi Arabia are trying to sell the IPO to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-investment-exclusive/exclusive-saudi-aramco-lures-sovereign-funds-to-hit-2-trillion-ipo-valuation-sources-idUSKBN1WB1G2">international funds</a>, including American funds. Further, Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is included in a couple of international index funds, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/saudi-arabia-tadawul-completes-full-inclusion-on-msci-index.html">MSCI</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/18/saudi-arabias-tadawul-joins-global-emerging-markets-indexes.html">FTSE</a>. All of this means that foreign investors can and possibly will be exposed to Aramco shares, and they must be wary of an impending bubble burst if and when the government’s efforts to prop-up the stock price no longer succeed.</p>
