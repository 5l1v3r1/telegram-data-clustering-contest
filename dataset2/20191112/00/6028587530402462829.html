      <h1>Buy Calls to Bet on a Short-Term PayPal Pop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Schaeffer's Investment Research</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/analysis/2019/10/17/paypal-flashes-reliable-buy-signal-before-earnings"><b>Payments specialist</b></a> Paypal (PYPL) gapped higher late last month in the wake of an upbeat quarterly report. The shares have since taken a breather, and are fresh off back-to-back weekly losses. The good news is that this pullback has taken PYPL to a historically bullish trendline, if past is precedent. Paypal’s recent struggles have the shares testing their 320-day moving average this month, which has proven to act as support over the past three years. According to Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, in the four other times PYPL has pulled back to this trendline during this time frame, the shares were up 6.6%, on average, one month out, with all four of the returns positive.</p>
      <p>What's more, the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) stands at 23%, near its two-year average of 28.3%. If the SVI holds steady around its two-year average over the next month, White’s modeling shows that an in-the-money PYPL call option could potentially return 108% over the next 21 days on another expected bounce off the 320-day trendline. In other words, prospective call buyers could more than double their money on a 6.6% gain in the underlying stock.</p>
      <p>From its current perch at $102.24, a similar 6.6% bump higher a month from now would have Paypal stock toppling the $109 level for the first time in nearly two months by mid-December. And while PYPL is up 21% year-to-date, it has a lot of work to do to reclaim its July 16 all-time high of $121.48.</p>

      <p>As far as options are concerned, put open interest outweighs call open interest among options expiring within three months, based on the Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.04. This reading ranks in the 94th annual percentile, so such a put-skew is rare for PYPL, and an unwinding of these bearish bets could fuel additional upside. </p>
