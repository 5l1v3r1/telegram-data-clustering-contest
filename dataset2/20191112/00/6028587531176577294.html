      <p>Isaac Newton said it best: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When it comes to “just” companies, this means that for every example of a good corporate action, there is an example of a business behaving badly. In the first six months of 2019, there were more than 3,800 publicly disclosed data breaches that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/08/20/data-breaches-expose-41-billion-records-in-first-six-months-of-2019/#9af8d1ebd549">compromised 4.1 billion records</a>. Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/10/23/i-understand-were-not-the-ideal-messenger-right-now-read-mark-zuckerbergs-remarks-to-congress/#111d1e613ccf">admitted to Congress</a> that “we have a lot to do to live up to people’s expectations on issues like privacy and security.” And outside of the data security realm, several big Silicon Valley names have seen their employees protest corporate policies on pay or contracts with government agencies responsible for carrying out controversial border or immigration policies.</p>
      <p>The Just 100, however, is not compiled based on headlines and protests. It <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2019/11/12/inside-the-2020-just-100-how-we-rank-americas-best-corporate-actors/#51d0ea655bc4">measures how companies perform on metrics that mean the most to regular Americans</a>–like worker treatment and customer treatment, among other issues. And then, as we’ve detailed in this methodology explainer, we analyze the Russell 1000 according to how each component (minus REITs and pending mergers) performs on each of those issues.</p>
      <p>This means that every one of the 922 companies analyzed gets a rank, and falls into a quintile. And a closer examination of these quintiles–the top <i>and</i> the bottom–continues to tell a story about why it can literally pay off to be a good corporate citizen. The research team at <a href="http://justcapital.com/rankings/">Just Capital</a> (our data partners for the Just 100) looked at each quintile’s market return, and the 2020 results are just as heartening <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2018/12/10/just-100-2019-the-bad-apples/#5b4ad8a328e6">as the 2019 results</a>, because they continue to prove that the companies that score the best on issues that matter most to the American public outperform the companies that have the worst scores.</p>
      <p>Here’s what the stock chart looks for the three years ending on September 30, 2019:</p>

      <p>The companies that fall into the bottom quintile and, particularly, bottom 10% of the Just universe are the firms that had the lowest scores in areas like worker treatment and environmental impact. In some cases, a low ranking is also a matter of transparency; without proper data, disclosures and standards around corporate behavior, it’s impossible to know where a company truly stands.</p>
      <p>What all of this means is that much of the bottom 10%’s under-performance on “Just” criteria can be seen as an indictment of persistent industry trends—for instance, as has been the case for the last <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2017/12/12/bottom-of-the-barrel-88-of-americas-worst-corporate-citizens/#5e00c2754411">two years</a>, many of the names on the list come from the retail or restaurant/hotel industry, because these businesses have continued to depend on hourly employees that are paid minimum wage and don’t have access to the posh benefits we see among the Just 100.</p>
      <p>That said, Americans’ priorities have remained consistent every year we’ve done this list; <a href="https://justcapital.com/polling/">Just Capital’s polling</a> consistently tells us that what Americans want from all business is a fair wage that is also a living wage, a workplace that provides equal opportunities, and acts ethically at the leadership level. If the 2019 “bottom of the barrel” hasn’t yet awoken to this reality, it’s time that they listened to their alarm clocks.</p>
