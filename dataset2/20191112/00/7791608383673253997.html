      <p><b>Reebok has</b> unified its brand under a modernized version of its famous Vector logo, forgoing its red Delta logo. <br/><b>While the latest</b> version may resemble the 1992 Vector logo closely, there have been subtle tweaks to make it slimmer and more contemporary, per <a href="https://www.marketing-interactive.com/reebok-rolls-out-subtle-modern-evolution-of-its-logo-unifies-branding/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Marketing Interactive</i></a> <br/><b>Karen Reuther,</b> the vice president of creative direction, explained to the publication that the “unified banner” could help to facilitate consistency in all Reebok’s “products and experiences.” <br/><b>She added that</b> the Vector logo was inspired by the Reebok “cross-check design” that dates back to half a century ago. <br/><b>Back in 2014,</b> the company <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/364122/Renowned-Sports-Brand-Reebok-Unveils-Its-New-Logo/">unveiled</a> its red Delta logo during the “Pain Is Temporary, Reebok Is Forever” campaign. <br/><b>However, as the</b> Vector logo was better known, it continued to be used on the Reebok Classics line and lifestyle products. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The modernized</b> Vector logo will be used across all Reebok sport and lifestyle products, including the upcoming sports styles to be launched in late November. <br/><b>Meanwhile, the red</b> Delta symbol would be limited to select products, such as CrossFit and UFC-branded Reebok outfits, as stated in <i>Marketing Interactive</i>. <br/><b>The latest logo</b> has already been displayed outside its Drydock Avenue headquarters in Boston last Thursday. Reebok president Matt O’Tool said that the new logo would represent the brand’s bridging of “fitness and fashion.” <br/><b>Check out the</b> before-and-after images and see if you can spot the rather subtle changes.</p>
