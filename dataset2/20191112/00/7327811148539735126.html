      <p>Police said two Toms River men, 22-year-old Braden DeMartin and 23-year-old Daniel Foley, were deceased when emergency responders arrived at the scene.</p>
      <p>"I took the day off, so I just came and brought some flowers, and just trying to be there for my friend," said Jacob Palecki, who said he went to middle school with Foley.</p>
      <p>Police said the structure, which was unoccupied at the time, had been deemed unsafe by a building inspector. Sgt. Vincent Padalino said the building, which is across from Hooper Avenue Elementary School, houses four businesses, including a counseling service and a real estate company.</p>
      <p>"We lost a really good guy, and my heart goes out to his family," said Palecki. "He loved cars. He called it a "CarB-Q," and he had a bunch of cars, he had all his family and friends there, and they were all showing off the different kinds of cars they had. That's what really brought him joy.</p>
      <p>Police have been taking measurements to see how fast the car was going, and are looking into alcohol as a possible factor. It's still not clear who the car belonged to.</p>
