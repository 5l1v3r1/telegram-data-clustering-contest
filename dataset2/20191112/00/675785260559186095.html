      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The former Geordie Shore star recently relocated to Bolton to move in with beau Josh Ritchie - and she tells us it's going amazingly so far</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:01:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/charlotte-crosby">Charlotte Crosby</a> says she feels closer than ever to boyfriend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joshua-ritchie">Josh Ritchie</a> .</p>
      <p>The former Geordie Shore star waved goodbye to the Toon to move in with Josh in Bolton, and things are going better than ever.</p>
      <p>The couple's two-year romance has been through some rocky patches, with them arguing over when to have kids and about how often he goes on lads' nights out.</p>
      <p>But Charlotte, 29, says moving in together has been bliss.</p>
      <p>Charlotte opened up about how her relationship has changed during an exclusive chat with Mirror Online ahead of the new series of her MTV show Just Tattoo Of Us.</p>

      <p>She said: "I've not spent much time [at the house], I was there for a week so I could get all the deliveries and furniture in but then after that I was back in Australia, came back yesterday and I'm away again so had one day there.</p>
      <p>"I'm hardly at the house but I do see Josh all the time, we've just spent three weeks in Australia together, but I've never been in one place more than one week at a time, that's why I decided to rent my house out because it was a complete and utter waste of money, it was just sitting there empty."</p>
      <p>She added: "We have learnt a lot more [since moving in together] and it's been really, really good. We're getting on so well, I think it's brought us closer together.</p>
      <p>"We've had no arguments about cleaning and stuff, he's so tidy, always doing the washing, it's really been perfect."</p>

      <p>Just Tattoo Of Us is returning for a fifth season.</p>
      <p>And it's set to be wilder than ever thanks to a brand new twist.</p>
      <p>Charlotte explained: "I'm very proud that it's got that far, a lot of shows will only have one series then not get recomissioned. I couldn't be prouder, I love its craziness and its completely unfiltered nature and this series is just taking it to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>"Now we've got this stick or twist which is where people have got the option to stick with the tattoo their friend's given them or twist and get a completely random tattoo designed by one of the artists, and that element to it is a complete gamble and this tattoo could be worse or better.</p>

      <p>"People get so p****d off when they choose to twist. It just opens up a brand new can of worms, there's all these new elements you could be angry about because your friend could have got you a nice one and you end up with a horrible one and they'll be p****d off because you didn't trust them.</p>
      <p>"It makes the show even crazier and I didn't think it could get any crazier."</p>
      <p>Again this series, Charlotte will be joined by guest hosts, including her boyfriend, Geordie Shore co-star Chloe Ferry and Love Island's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/olivia-attwood">Olivia Attwood</a> .</p>
      <p>But Charlotte admits she's ready for a regular co-host again.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm ready to have a regular co-host again, it's all over the place when there's guests. For me, it's quite hard because I'm getting a different person every couple of days and most of the time they don't know what they're doing and the producers rely on me to bring it back.</p>

      <p>"If we get a guest host who isn't very good or doesn't know what they're doing I have to do their job for them too so I'm doing a lot more work, so I think it's time we had a regular."</p>
      <p>Charlotte also confirmed the fourth series of The Charlotte Show will begin filming next year.</p>
      <p>*Charlotte Crosby is back with Just Tattoo Of Us series five, which premieres Monday, November 18 at 10pm on MTV</p>
