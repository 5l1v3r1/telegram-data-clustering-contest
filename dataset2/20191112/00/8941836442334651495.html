      <h1>Gobert goes for 25 and 14 as Jazz beat frustrated Warriors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">JOE STIGLICH</a></address>
      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donovan-mitchell/">Donovan Mitchell</a> and the Utah Jazz showed they can be a dangerous team from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donovan-mitchell/">Mitchell</a> and Mike Conley each hit five 3-pointers as the Jazz shot 56 percent (15 for 27) from deep over the first three quarters to take command in a 122-108 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Golden State Warriors</a> on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Utah entered averaging 29.3 attempts per game from 3-point range, fifth-fewest in the NBA.</p>
      <p>“We’re a team that we want to be able to shoot 3s and make 3s at a high clip,” Conley said. “We’ve got a lot of guys who can do it.”</p>
      <p>Rudy Gobert had 25 points and 14 rebounds to power the Jazz inside, but it was their perimeter shooting that made the difference every time the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Warriors</a> threatened a comeback.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donovan-mitchell/">Mitchell</a> added 23 points and Conley scored 22 for Utah, which improved to 7-3.</p>
      <p>The injury-ravaged <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Warriors</a> fell to an NBA-worst 2-9, and their frustrations boiled over in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Draymond Green, back after missing five games with a torn finger ligament, earned back-to-back technicals and an ejection for arguing a blocking call with 8:28 left.</p>
      <p>“I disagreed with that call, and I’m never going to be OK with another grown man telling me don’t talk,” Green said.</p>

        <p>“If you feel like you got the call wrong, or right, you don’t tell me not to talk. I’m a grown man.”</p>
        <p>Less than a minute later, coach Steve Kerr was given a technical after arguing a kicked-ball call against Jordan Poole.</p>
        <p>It’s been that kind of season so far for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Warriors</a>, who had their biggest star back in the building Monday.</p>
        <p>Stephen Curry, sidelined for at least the next three months because of a broken left hand, held a pregame media briefing to discuss his injury and try to lend his teammates some moral support.</p>
        <p>Point guard D’Angelo Russell continues to be a bright spot for Golden State. He scored 33 points, his fourth consecutive game of 30 or more.</p>
        <p>Green pointed out it’s a different offense the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Warriors</a> are running than before he was injured. With Curry out, Kerr is putting the ball in Russell’s hands, which means more pick-and-rolls and less rapid-fire passing.</p>
        <p>“I don’t really have the ball in my hands. I’ve always been a playmaker. I don’t really have the ball much,” Green said. “It’s just (something) to figure out. It’s not the first time in my career I’ve had to figure something out.”</p>
        <p>Kerr agreed it’s an adjustment for Green, whose slick passing always has been a staple of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Warriors</a>‘ offense.</p>
        <p>“It’s kind of a strange case where the guy who’s been here the longest is the newest with what we’re doing,” Kerr said.</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p>Jazz: Entered the night with the NBA’s 28th-ranked offense at 101 points per game. … Finished 16 for 35 (46 percent) from 3-point range and went 26 of 32 at the foul line. … Utah, which is 5-0 at home, improved to 2-3 on the road.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/golden-state-warriors/">Warriors</a>: Green’s return to the lineup was a welcome sign, but his presence was felt even before the opening tip. “We already felt it this morning in shootaround, just his voice,” Kerr said. … Golden State also welcomed back rookie forward Eric Paschall, who missed Saturday’s game at Oklahoma City with a bruised hip. Paschall, who averaged 22.5 points in the four games leading up to his injury, finished with eight.</p>
        <p>JERSEY EXCHANGE</p>
        <p>Paschall and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donovan-mitchell/">Mitchell</a>, AAU teammates in Harlem, New York, during their younger days, exchanged jerseys after the game.</p>
        <p>“I’ll probably hang it up,” Paschall said. “Just to be able to switch jerseys with him is so special. I know our families are very happy and very blessed that we’re in a position to do this.”</p>
        <p>KERR REFLECTS</p>
        <p>Kerr began his pregame media briefing by sending condolences to the family of Bernard Tyson, the CEO and chairman of Kaiser Permanente who died Sunday at age 60. “He was a wonderful man, someone who made a huge impact here in the Bay Area, the community and with our team,” Kerr said.</p>
