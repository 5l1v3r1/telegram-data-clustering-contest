      <p><b>Topline: </b>The House Intelligence Committee begins its public impeachment hearings Wednesday into President Trump’s alleged pressuring of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, which will be broadcast live on most TV (NBC, CBS, PBS, ABC) and cable news networks (MSNBC, Fox News, C-SPAN, CNN) and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/778215350/impeachment-hearing-faq-who-will-testify-and-how-the-questioning-will-work">on most</a> public radio stations, with testimony to continue intermittently for weeks—though Democrats have signaled they want the hearings to wrap by the end of the year. </p>

        <li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/trump-impeachment-probe-public-hearings-start-this-week.html"><b>When</b></a><b> are the hearings?</b> Two are scheduled for Wednesday, with the first beginning at 10 a.m. EST, with an expected end time between 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.; a  third is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Friday. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/public-impeachment-hearings-what-to-know-about-bill-taylor-george-kent-and-marie-yovanovitch-the-witnesses/"><b>Who</b></a><b> is expected to testify? </b>Diplomats Bill Taylor and George Kent will testify at Wednesday’s hearings, while ousted Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch will testify Friday (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/public-impeachment-hearings-what-to-know-about-bill-taylor-george-kent-and-marie-yovanovitch-the-witnesses/">all three</a> have previously testified in closed-door hearings that Trump did indeed withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of his political rivals). And next week, even <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJNq5p4XUAAXI1T.jpg">more </a>career diplomats will testify, including Kurt Volker, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/05/why-impeachment-observers-are-calling-sondlands-reversal-a-game-changer/#a0fa4f404945">Gordon Sondland</a> and Fiona Hill.</li>
        <li><b>Which TV anchors are </b><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/cbs-news-impeachment-hearing-1202781213/"><b>covering</b></a><b> it? </b>For ABC News: George Stephanopoulos and <i>World News Tonight</i> anchor David Muir; for NBC News: <i>Nightly News</i> host Lester Holt, <i>Today</i> anchor Savannah Guthrie and Chuck Todd; for Fox News: Bret Baier and Chris Wallace; for CBS: <i>Evening News </i>anchor Norah O’Donnell. </li>
        <li><b>How will the hearings </b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-impeachment-news.html"><b>work</b></a><b>? </b>Committee chairman Adam Schiff and ranking member Devin Nunes will have up to 45 minutes each for questioning and can designate trained staff to take the lead; after that, individual committee members can be recognized to question witnesses for an additional five minutes. </li>
        <li><b>What could derail the hearings? </b>Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/impeachment-strategy-republicans.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">trying to focus</a> on Joe and Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine, but Schiff has said the hearings <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/sham-investigation-of-bidens-will-not-dominate-impeachment-hearings-house-democrat-idUSKBN1XM1E2">won’t be allowed</a> to turn into a spotlight on “sham investigations” of the Bidens. </li>
        <li><b>What are the odds Hunter Biden will testify? </b>Republicans have submitted a list of witnesses they’d like to testify, including Hunter Biden, but Democrats have the authority to decide whether any of the Republicans’ requested witnesses will appear; Schiff has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/democrats-push-back-gop-efforts-have-whistleblower-hunter-biden-testify-n1079476b">indicated</a> Biden will not be asked to appear. </li>
        <li><b>Will the anonymous whistleblower show up? </b>The whistleblower⁠—whose report on Trump’s infamous July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelensky set off the impeachment inquiry⁠—is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/dangerous-reckless-whistleblower-s-lawyer-sends-cease-desist-letter-white-n1078836">only willing</a> to answer written questions, citing concerns for personal safety, according to his attorney, Andrew Bakaj.</li>
        <li><b>When will the House vote on impeachment? </b>After the intelligence committee finishes its public hearings, it will submit a report⁠ (which will also be made public⁠) to the House Judiciary Committee, which will review the report and possibly draft articles of impeachment.</li>
        <li><b>What else does the Judiciary Committee do? </b>Before it decides to draft any articles of impeachment, the committee will <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/press-releases/chairman-nadler-statement-judiciary-committee-impeachment-procedures">have to determine</a> whether any wrongdoing was committed by Trump, meaning it will call witnesses and examine evidence before it makes a decision.</li>
        <li><b>Will the Senate hold a trial if the House impeaches Trump? </b>Majority leader Mitch McConnell has<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcconnell-tells-senate-republicans-to-be-ready-for-impeachment-trial-of-trump/2019/10/16/52c0a62e-f050-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html"> indicated</a> that the Senate will have to hold a trial if the House votes to impeach, which would probably take place <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/778215350/impeachment-hearing-faq-who-will-testify-and-how-the-questioning-will-work">over the course</a> of a few weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Chief critic:</b> Trump. Among his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/11/12/229f5484-04de-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">complaints</a>: That the entire inquiry is a “witch hunt,” that he’s not being given due process and that Democrats are relying on “2nd and 3rd hand witnesses,” even though he’s ordered Trump administration officials, like former national security advisor John Bolton and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney not to testify. (Bolton, however, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/private-speech-bolton-suggests-some-trump-s-foreign-policy-decisions-n1080651">reportedly said</a> during a private speech last week that Trump’s foreign policy choices are guided by personal or financial interests.) During a Tuesday <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/12/nobodys-cheated-better-trump-slams-china-in-latest-speech-on-the-economy/#3b0dbfa65c00">speech</a>, Trump said the inquiry was “going nowhere.” Earlier the same day, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194279077546483714">retweeted</a> a video created by House Republicans that claims Schiff has treated him unfairly. “A total Impeachment Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats!” </p>
      <p><b>What to watch for: </b>Whether Trump releases records of another phone call between himself and Zelensky. It took place in April, before the July 25 call. Trump has called the April call <a href="https://apnews.com/99ac0ebc2545433f8dec1315d67ea404">“more important”</a> than the July call. He said Tuesday that he would release the April phone call records sometime this week. </p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>House Democrats <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/09/24/pelosi-reportedly-plans-formal-impeachment-inquiry/#103827c02397">launched</a> the impeachment inquiry September 24. It stemmed from the whistleblower’s report that alleged Trump sought help from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/09/26/trump-whistleblower-complaint-expected-to-be-released-thursday/">report</a>, along with released <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/09/25/trump-urged-ukraine-to-investigate-joe-biden-in-phone-call-transcript/">records</a> of a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, became the basis of the Democrats’ inquiry. The House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/house-impeachment-vote.html">voted</a> October 31 in favor of a resolution (including procedural rules) to move the impeachment inquiry forward. And Schiff <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/11/06/public-impeachment-hearings-start-next-week-says-adam-schiff/#39b8e4c61da1">announced</a> last Wednesday that public hearings were set to begin this week. </p>
