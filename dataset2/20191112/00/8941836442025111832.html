      <p>NYON, Switzerland (AP) - UEFA has announced a new food sector sponsor for the European Championship, replacing McDonald’s which owned the slot since 1992.</p>
      <p>UEFA says food delivery platform <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/takeawaycom/">Takeaway.com</a> has signed for the Euro 2020 tournament. The value was not disclosed.</p>
      <p>Until cutting short its longstanding IOC sponsorship in 2017, McDonald’s was a presence at the major global sports events as a partner of the Olympic Games plus FIFA’s World Cup and UEFA’s Euro. McDonald’s FIFA deal extends to the 2022 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Netherlands-based <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/takeawaycom/">Takeaway.com</a> was launched 19 years ago and operates in 10 European countries, including three of the 12 Euro 2020 host cities spread across the continent.</p>
      <p>UEFA says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/takeawaycom/">Takeaway.com</a> will take over the tournament player escort program which lets children accompany teams on the field before games.</p>
