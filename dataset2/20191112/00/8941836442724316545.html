      <p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - The National Marine Fisheries Service proposed creating critical habitat sites to protect humpback whales that will extend to waters off Alaska, officials said.</p>
      <p>The habitats are focused on the feeding areas of groups of humpback whales and include the area off Juneau, The Juneau Empire reported Sunday.</p>
      <p>A critical habitat does not establish a sanctuary or preserve, said Lisa Manning, an official with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the fisheries service. Manning conducted a public presentation about critical habitats at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau last week.</p>
      <p>“It does not affect recreational activities. It does not affect private lands,” Manning said. “It only affects federal activities.”</p>
      <p>The proposed habitats cover 175,182 square nautical miles (600,857 square kilometers) of the traditional feeding areas of three of the 14 major humpback whale distinct population segments, Manning said.</p>

      <p>The whale groups feed on euphausiids and small fish in Alaska and California waters in the summer and spend the other months near Mexico, Central America and Taiwan, she said.</p>
      <p>Critical habitat designation limits the effects of climate change, direct harvest of prey in commercial fisheries, ocean noise, and pollution created by federal agencies or federal actions, Manning said.</p>
      <p>The three groups in Alaska waters are threatened, with some numbering 2,000 whales or less. Protecting their feeding areas may help them regain their footing, Manning said.</p>
      <p>Doug Vincent-Lang, Alaska Department of Fish and Game commissioner, expressed doubts that the designated critical habitats would have much of a positive effect. Alaska policies have already helped reinvigorate humpback populations in the region, he said.</p>

        <p>“Portions of these areas are not even known humpback feeding grounds,” Vincent-Lang said.</p>
