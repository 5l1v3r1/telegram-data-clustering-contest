      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>Two words, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/vegandubai">vegan</a> tacos. What more could you want from a restaurant? Salads, pizza, frittatas, French toast, moussaka? Visit Brambles and you’ll have it all.<br/><br/>This newly opened restaurant in Barsha Heights is the perfect place to visit for a lazy long breakfast (available all day) or a chilled-out relaxed lunch. It’s located in a hotel lobby but it’s tucked away just enough you won’t feel the hustle and bustle of tourists on holiday lugging their suitcases across the floor.<br/><br/>Pastel pink walls and Insta-worthy cushions give this <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">restaurant</a> a laid-back feel. It’s quiet when we arrive so we take a seat right by ‘The Market’, the fresh salad bar.<br/><br/>Vegans and vegetarians are spoilt for choice. We decide on the nomad tacos and sweet potato and kale frittata. The former is outstanding – packed full of roasted sweet potato and crunchy red cabbage. The tahini dressing and shakshuka sauce provide the perfect mix of spiciness and creaminess, too.<br/><br/>The frittata is another hit, the large slice comes with sriracha yoghurt and a small rocket salad, it’s the perfect balance of heavy and light and will leave you satisfied yet not overly full.<br/><br/>For those wanting a lighter bite, go for the açai bowls, which are vegan and all are delicious. The cacao version is our favourite, with the aloha bowl coming a close second.<br/><br/>With such a vast selection of <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/vegandubai">plant-based food</a>, that’s all vibrant and tasty, this could well be our new go-to lunch spot.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Vegan-friendly spot in Barsha Heights<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>For the tacos. And the bowls. And everything in between<br/><br/><b>VEGETARIAN-FRIENDLY</b><br/>4/5<br/><br/><b>VEGAN-FRIENDLY</b><br/>5/5</p>

      <p><b>AFTERNOON TEA SPECIAL</b><br/><br/>Brambles is well known for catering to <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/vegandubai">vegans</a> so when afternoon tea was launched we couldn’t wait to check it out. The set menu is available daily from 3pm to 6pm and you’ll have to book 48 hours in advance.<br/><br/>On the menu are staples such as the classic cucumber and cream cheese sandwich and, of course, scones with clotted cream and jam. First glance and we know we’re in for a treat.<br/><br/>When we’re seated we’re given a choice of teas, we opt for a jasmine and a camomile. Both arrive in pink floral teapots.<br/><br/>Our <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">food</a> arrives looking as pretty as anything, there’s no square cut sandwiches in sight. The beet hummus and green apple are heart shaped, there are sweet potato hummus and caramelised crostinis and even sundried tomato, vegan cheese, fried capers, cuccumber cups. It’s all very pleasing on the eye, and even more so on the taste buds.<br/><br/>The desserts are just as pretty, but are a bit hit and miss. The bites are small protein-style balls, which feel a bit out of place on the tea stand and the PB and berry compote look pretty, but don’t stand out.<br/><br/>Of course no <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397985-dubais-best-places-for-afternoon-tea-2019">afternoon tea</a> is complete without scones and happily Brambles does this very well. There’s a classic scone and an oat and coconut version, the latter of which when combined with coconut cream and blueberry jam is a real winner.<br/><br/>Everything on the tea stand is refillable once so pick your favourites and get reordering.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Delightful vegan afternoon tea<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>Didn’t we just say it was delightful?<br/><br/><b>VEGETARIAN-FRIENDLY</b><br/>5/5<br/><br/><b>VEGAN-FRIENDLY</b><br/>5/5</p>
