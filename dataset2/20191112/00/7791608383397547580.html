      <p><b>A pack of hounds</b> took around three minutes to decapitate a fox, in a hunt allegedly organized by the East Sussex and Romney Marsh Hunt, per <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/pack-hounds-filmed-decapitating-fox-legal-hunt-11078926/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Metro UK</i></a>. <br/><b>In disturbing</b> images taken by the drone operated by a hunt saboteur, the fox’s body was spread all over the field near the village of East Guldeford, East Sussex. <br/><b>Harry Blackhurst</b> from Kent Hunt Saboteurs and his team were informed by South Coast Hunt Saboteurs about the incident. The Saboteurs were already chasing after the hounds last Saturday. He then released the drone when the pack of dogs ran on the field, with huntsmen on horseback behind them. <br/><b>The Hunt</b> Saboteurs arrived earlier. Blackhurst’s team then heard the hounds cry out when they caught the scent of the fox. They attempted to “distract” the hounds by using a horn, but when the dogs caught on to another scent, they moved in for the kill. <br/><b>Blackhurst described the</b> scene as “awful” as he watched the pack mutilate the fox on his drone camera, a close distance from where he was. He explained that the path was laden with ditches, and the fox could not be saved “on time.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>He also claimed</b> he saw a crowd of about 30 people watching the hunt, and laughing when the poor fox was decapitated. He expressed sympathy for the fox’s slow and painful death. <br/><b>The Sussex Police</b> was called in, labeling the incident as “illegal fox hunting” and promising to “investigate” with the grisly footage at hand.</p>
