        <b>In Australia’s south-east, communities have been warned of «catastrophic» conditions as the state of New South Wales is fighting more than 50 bushfires.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50375407">The British public broadcaster BBC reports</a> that state authorities warn that fires will spread quickly to endanger lives amid hot temperatures and strong winds.</p>
      <p>About six million people live in the region.</p>
      <p>People in vulnerable areas have been urged to stay away from bushland, and to flee their homes before the fires escalate. More than 600 schools are closed across the state.</p>
      <p>New South Wales State Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who has declared a seven-day state of emergency, stated Tuesday would be «about protecting life, protecting property and ensuring everybody is safe as possible», BBC reports.</p>
