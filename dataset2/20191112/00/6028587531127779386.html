      <h1>Is College Worth It? Um, Yes!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Whitmire</a></address>
      <p>Whenever I hear someone raise the “Is college worth it?” question, I suggest a simple survey anyone can do. Next time you rent a car at the airport, ask the clipboard-bearing employee — that friendly person checking for dents and scratches — where they went to college.Doesn’t seem like learning Shakespeare, calculus or organic chemistry is really needed for that job, right? But the odds greatly favor your rental agent having a bachelor’s degree.</p>
      <p>Surprising? Not really. Like it not — and a lot of conservatives really hate this reality — college is the new high school. A college degree guarantees the social skills that make customers feel comfortable with that agent. And the added advantage for the rental company: Those are employees with entrepreneurial skills to climb the corporate ladder and grow the company. </p>
      <p>Knowing this is why a recent poll showing that many younger Americans no longer consider college the pathway to economic success is dismaying — but not surprising. For several years now, some pundits have kept up a steady drumbeat: welders trump English majors. Who needs college?</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/d95f28b579a64c888c74b016ebedd002">pol</a>l, from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, shows that while half of Americans 13 through 29 see college as the preferred pathway for economic success, a full 40 percent believe a bachelor’s degree prepares people only somewhat well, or even poorly, for that success.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the survey results split along income lines, with students from wealthier families far more likely to favor four-year degrees, while students from low-income families more skeptical of the need.</p>
      <p>And that’s a problem. With the growing economic divides threatening our important self-image of America as a long of opportunity, the message needs to get through to low-income students that college degrees matter. I’ve been researching and writing on this issue for the past two years, trying to point out our national failure to make a dent in income gaps through education.</p>
      <p>The more students and their parents read that college just isn’t worth it, the more they believe it. And the more they believe it, the more likely those students will become part of the massive “summer melt” — students whose counselors convinced them of the importance of going to college, but who changed their minds over the summer — often influenced by parents who lack degrees raising the “worth” question and worrying about debt.</p>
      <p>But could their skepticism about college be right? Not based on earnings. The national arbiter of the data on the <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/valueofcollegemajors/">value of college degrees</a> is Anthony Carnevale, director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University. His bottom line: On average, college graduates earn $1 million more than high school graduates. </p>
      <p>And that’s just the beginning. College graduates with the highest-paying majors earn $3.4 million more than the lowest-paying majors.</p>
      <p>But what about those high paying, blue collar fields of employment, especially those lucrative welding jobs we hear about?</p>
      <p>My favorite response comes in Paul Tough’s new book, <i>The Years That Matters Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us</i>. Tough quotes the 2014 <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/josh-mandel-welders-make-150-000-bring-back-shop-class-1398122381">column</a> by Josh Mandel, the former Ohio state treasurer who ran for the U.S. Senate. The title of the column: “Welders Make $150,000? Bring Back Shop Class.” That sentiment, regularly quoted by school reform skeptics who question the push to get more first-generation students into and through college, was enticingly framed by Mandel:</p>
      <p>“Too many young people have four-year liberal-arts degrees, are thousands of dollars in debt and find themselves serving coffee at Starbucks or working part-time at the mall.”</p>
      <p>The appeal is clear: Why work so hard to push up college success numbers for low-income, minority students when there’s a world of higher paying jobs awaiting in the trades?</p>
      <p>After that column was published, Tough points to others quick to follow. Another <i>Journal</i> article claimed that welders in Texas and Appalachia were making as much as $350,000 a year. In the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, said: “For the life of me, I don’t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.”</p>
      <p>Who can argue with that? Tough does.</p>
      <p>To gain a welding certification, you first have to go to college (yes, college!)  to earn an associate’s degree, he said, which requires passing basic classes in math and English and, at the Ohio community college he cited, 13 separate welding courses. The would-be welder Tough profiles in the book struggled with college, fell short of completing and yet faced $19,000 in school debts. </p>
      <p>That’s when the aspiring welder realized that welding jobs in Ohio actually paid between $12 and $15 an hour, less than he was making working in a door factory. Yes, there are higher paying welding jobs in places such as Alaska, but the average welder makes $36,000 a year (in 2014), according to federal employment statistics.</p>
      <p>So yes, it’s a problem that so many young people think skipping college is a smart move. What can you do about it? The next time you hear someone espouse the “College Isn’t Worth It” argument, please suggest the rental car test.</p>
