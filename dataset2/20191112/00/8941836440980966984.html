      <p>PARIS (AP) - French President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Emmanuel Macron</a> says he will meet with U.S. President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> ahead of the Dec. 3-4 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-atlantic-treaty-organization-nato/">NATO</a> summit in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/london/">London</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> tweeted that he had an “excellent discussion” with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> on Monday evening about Syria, Iran and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-atlantic-treaty-organization-nato/">NATO</a> military alliance. They evoked “lots of convergences,” he said, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>The phone call comes after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emmanuel-macron/">Macron</a> claimed last week that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the “brain death” of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/north-atlantic-treaty-organization-nato/">NATO</a> and said the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.</p>
