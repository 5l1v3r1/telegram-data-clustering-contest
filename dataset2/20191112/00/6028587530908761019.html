      <p><b>Mark Zuckerberg took </b>a verbal beating over Libra (among other things), Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency and payments system, when he recently testified before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. Well aware of the low repute in which Facebook and other high-tech giants are held these days, most of the committee’s politicians couldn’t resist the temptation to scold and harangue Zuckerberg. Actually, issues such as privacy and money laundering are addressable. Facebook is already working with regulators on such concerns.Nonetheless, regulatory pressures have forced a number of companies that were partnering with Facebook on this project to drop out.</p>
      <p>And this gets to the real reason the idea of Libra is so troubling to so many politicians, government bureaucrats, banks and economists the world over: Libra could do to central banks what Uber and Lyft did to the taxi cartels—bust up their monopolies, or, to coin a phrase, give them a run for their money.</p>
      <p>Libra would be backed by a basket of currencies and gilt-edged financial instruments, thereby overcoming the biggest flaw of other cryptocurrencies today—their instability. Four thousand years of experience demonstrates that gold would be the best tie, but Libra’s basket would still be vastly superior to anything else out there.</p>
      <p>When Libra is up and running, a Facebook user could obtain a digital wallet called Calibra and could then send units of Libra to another Calibra wallet-holder anywhere in the world. The results would be instantly revolutionary. Under our current system, it’s expensive to wire money across borders, not to mention the hours or days it takes for funds to clear. Banks would be cut out of the process entirely!</p>
      <p>What a combination Libra offers: convenience and currency stability.</p>
      <p>Another enormous plus is that such a digital and mobile system would easily open up accessible banking services to the nearly 1 billion people worldwide and the 14 million in the U.S. who don’t have bank accounts. Amazingly—and unknown to most of the world—such digital banking has blossomed in Kenya, where millions of people, in response to the country’s lack of traditional bank branches and services, do their banking, in effect, via their mobile devices. China is also light-years ahead of the U.S. when it comes to digital transactions.</p>
      <p>In the face of so much hostility, will Libra get off the ground? Zuckerberg has made it clear that Facebook itself won’t move forward on Libra without U.S. regulatory approval. Since the Libra undertaking is now in the hands of the new Libra Association—a group of companies (including Facebook) and nonprofits—and is formally independent of Facebook, Libra could still launch. But in reality, without Facebook, Libra will go nowhere.</p>
      <p>It will take considerable diplomatic finesse and political skill for Libra to formally clear all the obstacles it faces, which is a shame, because something like Libra is eventually going to happen, and it would be nice if the creator were an American company. As Zuckerberg said in his prepared testimony, “While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn’t waiting. China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. Libra . . . will extend America’s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.”</p>
