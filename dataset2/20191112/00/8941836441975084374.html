      <p>Donald Trump Jr. trolled ABC’s “The View” on Tuesday after his heated episode with girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle last week fetched the show’s highest ratings in months.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Mr. Trump linked to a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-view-with-don-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-most-viewed-episode-in-more-than-six-months">story</a> by the Washington Examiner highlighting Nielsen Media Research’s latest figures, which showed that “The View” had an audience of slightly over 3 million people for its Nov. 7 episode, up from an average of 2.5 million viewers the week prior.</p>
      <p>“Confirmed, America has been looking for a different View,” the first son tweeted. “You’re welcome.”</p>

        <p>Mr. Trump’s episode repeatedly devolved into a shouting match among the guests, the co-hosts and even the audience members on-air and during commercial breaks. At one point during the show, co-host Joy Behar <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/7/joy-behar-snaps-at-trump-supporters-in-the-view-au/">scolded</a> audience members on-air for clapping for Mr. Trump, reminding them that “this is not a MAGA rally.”</p>
