      <p>Israeli startup <a href="https://www.uveye.com/">UVeye </a>has developed technology that can detect threats and other dangerous or illegal materials carried in a vehicle, without the need to make it stop for a physical inspection.The innovation, a feature called UV Inspect, has the potential to loosen logjams at international border crossings and other checkpoints by keeping traffic moving, while providing thorough threat detection. Indeed, the threat inspection can be accomplished while a vehicle is traveling at up to 25 miles per hour. </p>

      <p>“Our newest generation of deep-learning technology can detect within seconds a wide variety of threats, including explosives, firearms, illegal drugs, or other contraband,” said UVeye CEO Amir Hever, in a statement. “Compared to traditional vehicle-security methods, UVeye’s drive-through mobile and stationary inspection systems also ensure security without disrupting traffic.”</p>
      <p>First introduced in 2016 and offered to a tight group of clients, UVeye is now making UV Inspect technology available to security-industry companies globally. </p>
      <p>“The wider release of UV Inspect provides our customers with the first pass ability they need to identify threats on vehicles that have never been scanned or entered into a security-system database,” said Hever. </p>
      <p>This latest development comes as UVeye expands the use of its undercarriage inspection technology—a technology first developed for the security industry to detect weapons and explosives. </p>

      <p>Versions of the system are now in use at vehicle assembly plants to detect a wide array of flaws and damage without having to stop the line. The company, based in Tel Aviv and Stamford, Conn., has raised more than $35 million to work with Volvo Cars, Daimler AG, Skoda Auto and Toyota Group’s trading unit Toyota Tsusho Co. in developing and deploying quality control inspection systems. Those company’s have expressed interest in installing UVeye undercarriage inspection systems at new and used car dealerships and rental car lots in addition to assembly plants. </p>
      <p>Commercial real estate holding company W.R. Berkley Corp. was an early investor in UVeye, first buying into the startup three years ago and boosting its stake earlier this year when Volvo and Toyota Tsusho made their initial investments.</p>
      <p>UVeye has broadened its detection offerings to UV Compare, a deep-learning system that monitors repeat traffic trends to identify changes that might indicate a threat or issues of concern and license-plate recognition (LPR) to monitor check-point traffic or to support entrance-management at hotels, banks and other high-security locations. </p>
      <p>Amir said in a July interview all sorts of industries that include aviation and shipping have expressed interest in UVeye’s detection technology, but the focus remains in the auto sector. Making the UV Inspect vehicle threat detection system globally available strengthens the company’s position where it started—in vehicle security technology. </p>
