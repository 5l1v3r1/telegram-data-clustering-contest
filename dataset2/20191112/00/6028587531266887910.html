      <h1>Boris Johnson’s Refusal To Publish Russian Interference Report Is ‘Shameful', Says Hillary Clinton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Woollacott</a></address>
      <p>Hillary Clinton has spoken out about the British government's failure to release a report on Russian election interference, calling it 'inexplicable and shameful'. The report by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee was completed in March and passed over to the Prime Minister on 17 October.</p>
      <p>And while it's usual for reports such as this to be published more or less immediately, the government is claiming that this one needs several weeks' vetting - despite the fact that it's already been approved by the security services.</p>
      <p>The excuse has been described as 'plainly bogus' by committee chair Dominic Grieve.</p>
      <p>But if the government continues to get its way, the report won't appear until after the next election, scheduled for 12 December.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the BBC's Today program this morning, Clinton pointed to evidence of Russian interference in elections in the US and beyond.</p>
      <p>"There is no doubt - we know it in our country, we have seen it in Europe, we have seen it here - that Russia in particular is determined to try to shape the politics of western democracies," she said.</p>
      <p>"There's no doubt of the role that Russia played in our 2016 election and is continuing to play."</p>
      <p>The report is believed to contain evidence compiled by the GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 intelligence services and showing Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election.</p>
      <p>Individuals connected to the Russian government are believed to have massive sums to the Conservative Party. According to the Sunday Times, these include former arms tycoon Alexander Temerko, who has given more than £1.2 million to the party over the last seven years and describes Boris Johnson as a 'friend'.</p>
      <p>Another is Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Russian deputy finance minister, who has handed over more than £450,000 to the Conservatives in the last year. In all, the party is believed to have received more than £3.5 million from Russian funders since 2010.</p>
      <p>The British Parliament rises today, in preparation for the general election, meaning that unless the report is published today it will be under wraps until the next parliament is formed.</p>
      <p>"Every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens," Clinton told the BBC.</p>
      <p>"People who are about to vote in a month or so deserve to know what is in a report that - one has to speculate - must have something of concern: otherwise, why wouldn't it be publicly disclosed?"</p>
