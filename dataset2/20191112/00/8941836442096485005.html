      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Rocco Baldelli of the Minnesota Twins has narrowly beaten out Aaron Boone of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-yankees/">New York Yankees</a> to win AL Manager of the Year.</p>
      <p>Both received 13 first-place votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America revealed Tuesday night, but Baldelli got more second-place votes in his first year on the job. The 38-year-old is the youngest to win the award.</p>
      <p>Baldelli took over a team that won 78 games in 2018 and pushed them to 101 victories and an AL Central title. He worked tightly with Minnesota’s analytics-focused front office - a shift from predecessor Paul Molitor, who won this award in 2017 - and oversaw a turnaround propelled by the team’s major league record 307 home runs.</p>
      <p>The NL winner was set to be announced later Tuesday. The finalists are the Braves’ Brian Snitker, Brewers’ Craig Counsell and Cardinals’ Mike Shildt.</p>
