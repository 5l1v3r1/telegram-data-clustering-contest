      <p>Samsung is confirmed to launch a new foldable smartphone called the W20 on November 19 in China. A week before its official unveiling, specifications of the Galaxy W20 foldable smartphone have leaked online. The leak also gives us the first look at Samsung’s second foldable smartphone.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy W20 is reportedly a 5G version of the Galaxy Fold and also takes design cues from it, according to <a href="http://www.tenaa.com.cn/WSFW/ShowAllPic.aspx?code=O3IbwP3d8FgS1vu3PT03ehMDBzaIr8EX7/motAXazCTQwPRFzi8N1qweyWS/GXnc">images</a> listed on the certification website TENAA.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy W20 will have a hinge on the right edge, whereas the volume rocker, power button, and fingerprint scanner will be mounted on the left edge.</p>

      <p>When it comes to the displays, the Galaxy W20 would feature a 4.6-inch screen on the cover, which is the same as the Galaxy Fold. When unfolded, it is likely to have the same 7.3 dynamic AMOLED display. </p>
      <p>The listing also <a href="https://wap.tenaa.com.cn/WSFW/ParamImportant.aspx?code=px1dx6YhBAjSRRXYoANaSlpA/kJplYj8">reveals</a> that Galaxy W20 will have a smaller 4,135 mAh battery, compared to the 4,380 mAh cell on the Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>The rest of the specifications are currently unknown. The Galaxy W20 will run on Android 9 Pie-based One UI out of the box. Since the design is similar to the Galaxy Fold, we can expect a notch for housing the dual selfie cameras. Under the hood, the Galaxy W20 is expected to get powered by Snapdragon 855 or 855+ with 12GB RAM and 512GB internal storage.</p>
      <p>The cameras are also expected to feature the same sensors as the Galaxy Fold. This means that the Samsung Galaxy W20 could feature triple sensors on the back with a 16MP f/2.2 ultra-wide lens, a 12MP f/1.5-f/2.4 lens, and a 12MP f/2.4 lens with 2x optical zoom sensor setup.</p>
      <p>Above the cover screen, there could be a 10MP f/2.2 lens front-facing camera. When unfolded, the Galaxy W20 could house dual cameras with a 10MP f/2.2 lens and an 8MP f/1.9 RGB depth sensor.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
