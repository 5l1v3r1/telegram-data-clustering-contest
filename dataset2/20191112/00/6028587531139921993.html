      <h1>This Season’s Auctions? The “Old Normal” Says Head of Citi Art Advisory</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Barden Prisant</a></address>
      <p>Before I reveal Suzanne Gyorgy’s opinions about the current round of auctions, it is worth establishing her bona fides.</p>

      <p>A rarity in the world of big banks, her group, Citi Private Bank Art Advisory &amp; Finance, operates practically autonomously within the company’s hallowed halls. In her offices are art history PhD’s and MA’s, and even BFA’s; (she herself trained to be a painter at Pratt). Who’s not there?- MBA’s. Freed from the burden of number crunching, she and her staff can make decisions based purely on their art historical expertise. Seemingly, that has helped her group thrive for decades, as it now celebrates its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>
      <p>Started in 1979 by no less an art world colossus than Jeffrey Deitch, Gyorgy recounts that they were the first financial powerhouse “to give art advice around the world, help build collections, and accept art as collateral”. </p>

      <p>It has turned out that her division has often been the lure, bringing in new business to the other Citi divisions, as opposed to the reverse. As their clients have a net worth of $25 million or more, it is understandable why the finance wizards at the top handle her group with kid gloves. Not only are her charges wealthy, but they also evidently end up dedicated to Citi. “We have worked for generations of families, starting in the 80’s. We are now educating their children”, she explains.</p>
      <p>One aspect of that education is instilling a respect in the youngest generation for the works of the Old Masters. Certainly, from a collecting standpoint, it is far easier today to break into that market than the one for Contemporary art. At a given “price point” you can get “amazing quality”, she says. “There is life in the Old Master market”, she declares. “The price discrepancy between Contemporary and Old Master (art) makes you pause”. </p>
      <p>It is, though, the Impressionist &amp; Modern and Post-War &amp; Contemporary sales which always stuff the headlines. With the season upon us, I ask her her thoughts on the crop on offer. “I look at a lot of art, and I am enthused”, she responds. </p>
      <p>Her view runs rather counter to the bellyaching I have been reading in the art rags. They complain that “only” $1 billion worth of art is up for sale, which is approximately half of what the 2018 autumn sales grossed. “Everyone compares 2019 to 2018”, she bemoans, “It is not apples to apples”. She understands that auctioneers cannot force top quality items into their sales. It often depends upon what has been termed “the three D’s”- death, divorce, and debt- not exactly the types of events under the control of even Sotheby’s and Christie’s.</p>
      <p>“I am refreshed by these sales”, she continues, “They are much more piece by piece”. Almost a third of a billion dollars was attributable last autumn to the sale of just one man’s collection/vision: Barney Ebsworth. </p>

      <p>This time, the works had to be sourced painstakingly one-at-a-time. “This is the normal; it feels like it used to be. Just look at the art; this round is great”, she declares.</p>
      <p>Part of her enthusiasm is attributable to her wish to usher in a new generation of collectors. “It is the benefit of working with whole families”, she explains. For the Millenials, she can scope out works “down” in the five-figure range which she sees as overlooked gems. When asked to cite such a piece, she points to <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2019/contemporary-art-day-n10150/lot.412.html">Elizabeth Peyton’s <i>Kurt Writing (Newsweek)</i></a>. Carrying an estimate of $40,000-60,000, your correspondent agrees that it is likely underestimated. </p>

      <p>If enough new collectors fill in and bid at the “bottom” of the market, they might possibly make up for the lack of blockbuster paintings in the $20-50 million range. On the other hand, there may be increasing pressure from other comers. When asked if she goes to walk the endless aisles at the international art dealer fairs, she laughingly responds-</p>
      <p>“YES. I am lucky that sneakers are now so fashionable. There were 15 years when the auction houses dealt directly to collectors, but now the private sector has gotten much stronger, owing to mega-dealers like Gagosian, Hauser &amp; Wirth, and Zwirner. The fairs drive the international Contemporary scene; that is why it is the biggest sector”.  </p>

      <p>Ultimately, though, she feels that neither the auction houses nor the dealers command the heights. “From where I sit, “she observes, “individual collectors drive the market, using their own eyes. The collector has to be at the heart of it”. </p>
      <p>Consider yourself empowered.</p>
