      <h2>EastEnders spoilers have revealed fresh drama for Martin Fowler and wife Stacey, following his shock lie to her just weeks ago</h2>

      <p>EastEnders' Martin Fowler will make a shocking discovery next week on the BBC soap, ahead of dramatic Christmas scenes involving the character.</p>
      <p>It seems Martin is headed for turmoil and may be headed off the rails, as pictures from filming on location show him waving a gun around and appearing to kidnap Linda Carter.</p>
      <p>Keanu Taylor is also involved somehow, amid death fears ahead of his exit from the show in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Next week, amid dodgy dealings and a devastating blackmail storyline, Martin seems a little more in high spirits.</p>
      <p>He's been blackmailed by Ben Mitchell for weeks over wife Stacey Fowler's involvement in the attack on Phil Mitchell.</p>

      <p>Recent scenes saw a heartbroken Martin lie to wife Stacey that he'd slept with his ex Sonia, in a bid to keep her and the kids away from Walford after Ben threatened their lives.</p>
      <p>In scenes to air next week, Ben will begin to grow guilty about his treatment of Martin.</p>
      <p>Seeing how much he hates being part of his dodgy deals and working for him, he's left unsure - especially when he sees Martin happy with stepson Arthur.</p>

      <p>Is Ben having second thoughts, and will he stop his dealings?</p>
      <p>He's been left in a panic himself after boyfriend Callum Highway confirmed his plans to join the police, spelling trouble for criminal Ben.</p>
      <p>Back to Martin, and he's feeling a lot happier later on in the week - but his pal Kush Kazemi, Arthur's dad, seems to be hiding something.</p>

      <p>Martin tries to get back into contact with Stacey after their last showdown, and heads to the Slaters' house.</p>
      <p>But when he gets there, he's left shocked by what he finds.</p>
      <p>Stacey's mum Jean and Mo are packing up her things - does this mean a permanent exit is on the cards for the character?</p>
