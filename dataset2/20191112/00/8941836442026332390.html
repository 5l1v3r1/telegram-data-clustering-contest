      <p>CINCINNATI (AP) - John Brannen’s first win at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> was no big deal.</p>
      <p>The Bearcats had a low-key celebration in the locker room after their 81-59 victory over Drake on Monday night that displayed their new up-tempo offense under their first-year head coach.</p>
      <p>“We clapped it up, that’s about it,” center <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-vogt/">Chris Vogt</a> said. “Nothing too crazy.”</p>
      <p>It’s how Brannen wanted it after his first win in the Bearcats’ arena.</p>
      <p>“I was really appreciative of the players,” Brannen said. “Head coaches get too much credit, probably too much blame at the same time.”</p>

      <p>Jarron Cumberland scored all of his 11 points in the first half as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> (1-1) took control quickly, looking much better the second time around. The Bearcats struggled offensively during an opening nine-point loss at Ohio State, going 4 of 21 from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p>Against Drake, they made the most of a wide-open style installed by Brannen, who came from Northern Kentucky. Brannen replaced Mick Cronin , a defense-oriented coach who went to UCLA after a first-round loss in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
      <p>“I think our offense finally looked like it had a little more pace tonight,” Brannen said. “I thought we took a step forward.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> opened a 26-point lead in the first half, when it went 8 of 16 from beyond the arc. Cumberland led the way with 11 points, making three of his four shots from beyond the arc. Cumberland played only 4 minutes in the second half as Brannen turned to his bench.</p>

        <p>Cumberland’s cousin, Jaevin , added 17 points as they combined to go 8 of 14 from beyond the arc.</p>
        <p>“We go at each other sometimes, who can shoot the best,” Jaevin said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-vogt/">Vogt</a> had 12 points and three rebounds. The 7-foot-1 center played for Brannen at Northern Kentucky and got an NCAA waiver to play at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> this season. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-vogt/">Vogt</a> knows Brannen’s system the best and has quickly become the player that teammates turn to for advice.</p>
        <p>“It kind of surprised me how consistent he’s been from last year to this year,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-vogt/">Vogt</a> said. “I thought he might change something up or try new stuff.”</p>
        <p>Drake (1-1) relies on 3s but couldn’t find many open ones. The Bulldogs matched their school record with 17 3s during an 86-55 win over Kennesaw State, but went only 4 of 19 against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a>. Liam Robbins led the Bulldogs with 12 points and seven rebounds.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Drake has been one of the nation’s most prolific 3-point shooting teams the last few seasons, which was the focus of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a>’s man-to-man defense. D.J. Wilkins hit an open 3 from the corner to start the game, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> clamped down and the Bulldogs missed eight of their next nine shots from beyond the arc while falling behind by 20 points.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> is 26-2 in home openers at its current arena, with one of the losses coming last season when Ohio State won the first game in the refurbished arena.</p>
        <p>OLD FOES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> and Drake played regularly as members of the Missouri Valley Conference until 1970. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> leads the series 23-8. They hadn’t played since Jan. 23, 1974, when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> won at Drake 73-67.</p>
        <p>NOT ENOUGH POINTS</p>
        <p>Drake led the MVC in scoring last season at 75.4 points per game. The Bulldogs return three starters from the team that shared the regular-season title, but had trouble getting good shots against the much taller Bearcats. Drake shot 35.5 percent overall.</p>
        <p>BETTER VANTAGE POINT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-vogt/">Vogt</a> was part of the Northern Kentucky team that made the short trip across the Ohio River and got drubbed at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> last season.</p>
        <p>“The energy in the arena was crazy the whole night,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chris-vogt/">Vogt</a> said. “It’s great to be on this side for once rather than the opposing side.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Drake hosts Kansas City on Wednesday.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cincinnati/">Cincinnati</a> hosts Alabama A&amp;M; on Thursday.</p>
