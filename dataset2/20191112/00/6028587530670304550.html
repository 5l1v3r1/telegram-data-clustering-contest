      <h1>You Should Be Drinking Sherry This Holiday Season</h1>

      <p>When the weather starts to turn colder and you’re not in the mood for red wine, Fino sherry might be just the thing. Completely dry, it has a briny nutty complexity that encourages sipping, and a nice weight with a lingering finish.</p>

      <p>For some reason, in this country sherry is still thought of as a drink for little old ladies, perhaps because most people are only familiar with cream or Pedro Jimenez styles, which are sweet.</p>
      <p>But sherry actually comes in a wide variety, from bone dry to syrupy and unctuous. Unfortunately, the styles have long and complicated names (Amontillado, I’m looking at you) – and sometimes even within a specific style, products vary widely. The wine is also a flexible companion in a wide variety of cocktails, and plays well with the current low ABV trend.</p>
      <p>For the most part, sherry is made from two grapes, Palomino (for dry styles) and Pedro Ximénez (for sweet styles), grown in southwestern Spain. After vinification, the wine ages in casks, where it is subject to varying degrees of oxidation, depending upon the winemaker’s intent.</p>
      <p> These days, sherry is gaining appeal thanks to other oddities like orange wine – a similarly oxidized product—and the number of small producers all with unique stories and processes. It helps that, as an oxidized product, sherry stays tasty after it’s been opened much longer than regular wine – up to two weeks or so for the fino style and up to two months for a sweet variety.</p>

      <p>I asked Claire Henderson, senior brand manager and sherry educator, Gonzalez Byass USA, to share some thoughts about sherry, and ways to enjoy it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are a few things people should know about sherry that they don’t?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Henderson: </b>Sherry is probably one of the most versatile wines around, ranging from bone dry to extremely sweet. It is great by the glass, as an aperitif, with food and also in cocktails. Also, sherry is a wine-a fortified wine-and should be treated like a wine ie. served in a wine glass (not a traditional sherry schooner). Most styles should be served chilled.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How is sherry shaking off the stereotype of being for older people?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Henderson: </b>Through mixology and through food pairings at restaurants. Food-friendly and drier styles that are perfect as aperitifs or with savory foods, such as Fino and Amontillado, are appealing to wine drinkers new to the sherry category, and are being promoted by younger bartenders and chefs. Also, the oxidative and complex characters of sherry appeals to wine consumers who like orange wines and natural wines. The En Rama style of unfiltered Fino also works with natural wine fans. </p>
      <p>
        <b>How can sherry be combined with the new trend toward low-proof cocktails?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Henderson: </b>Sherry is perfect for low proof cocktails and has been embraced by the bartending community. It can be used to substitute spirits in a cocktail offering a wide palate of flavors while contributing less than half the alcohol, with most sherries being around 18 percent ABV. The sweeter styles can also be used in very small quantities to sweeten a cocktail, ie. where you would maybe use a spoon of simple syrup you can use some PX. This gives the natural sweetness of the wine and also adds depth and flavor. In addition, with exception of the fino styles, the majority of sherry wines are fully oxidized and therefore will last for weeks once opened.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some ways sherry fits into holiday entertaining?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Henderson: </b>Sherry has always been especially enjoyed over the holidays, although it is perfect all year round and for all occasions. For the holidays, specifically the sweeter cream styles [pair] with desserts ranging from pumpkin pie to cheesecake to trifle. In addition, sherry is a popular ingredient in egg nog, either with sweeter Cream styles or dry Amontillados and we have also found that the oxidative styles of Palo Cortado and Oloroso are the perfect match for turkey at Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Here are a few classic Sherry recipes that also happen to be low ABV. <b> </b></p>
