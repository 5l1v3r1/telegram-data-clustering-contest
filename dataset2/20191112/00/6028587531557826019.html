      <p>I find myself catching Shark Tank whenever I have time to watch TV. I enjoy watching entrepreneurs squabble, going back and forth, begging with a panel of million/billionaires about funding their businesses.Recently, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/11/mark-cuban-biggest-mistake-people-make-when-starting-a-business.html">Mark Cuban stated</a> in a radio interview that the biggest mistake most entrepreneurs make when launching a new business is "they think they have to raise money." </p>
      <p>But here’s what I find interesting. Every week, along with his cohorts, you’ll find Cuban negotiating, manipulating, berating, and investing in startups on Shark Tank every week.</p>
      <p>If you don’t have the money to start or fund your business, you have to have passion. Otherwise, you shouldn’t be considering getting into business anytime soon.</p>
      <p>You can always rely on the three F’s, right? Friends, family, and fools. Anyone who falls under that category can give you money, but it’s rarely ever enough to truly find a new venture properly. </p>
      <p>For most entrepreneurs, the banks won’t loan anything to you either.</p>
      <p>If you are confident your business is a sure thing, and you’ve done a business plan, you might want to turn to an investor. But you need to be smart in what you’re getting yourself involved with. </p>
      <p>Let’s play a game of Shark Tank: Say you’re an owner and your product is “flying widgets. You’re standing in front of an investor – say, Mark Cuban – asking for $200,000 in exchange for 20 percent equity.</p>
      <p>If Cuban takes you up on that offer, which he won’t, there has to be a way for you to buy back that 20 percent in the near future.</p>
      <p>No matter what happens, you want to have the ability to regain full ownership of your company.</p>
      <p>It’s just like purchasing a house or a car. You should be able to pay the principal right away to save on the interest.</p>
      <p>Having the ability, as 80 percent owner, to buy back your 20 percent at a multiple or an agreed formula to regain 100 percent control is essential when negotiating a deal. </p>
      <p>If anyone is not willing to give you that, you shouldn’t take their money; you should run!</p>
      <p>Though Cuban advises not to raise money, he has complete disregard for his own words on Shark Tank. Not only are his actions hypocritical, but they’re also completely wrong! </p>
      <p>If you’re afraid of getting into bed with an investor, another way you could build your business is through credit cards. Sounds risky, for sure, but you either have faith or you don’t.</p>
      <p>Put yourself “all in.” You control your future and your risk.  </p>
      <p>I knew someone who funded their operations for $200,000, all on a multitude of credit cards. This person put her life on the brink of financial ruin. Her plan, if the business fell apart, would be to pay back every cent – $300 a month for the rest of her life.</p>
      <p>It’s irrelevant whether or not she failed or succeeded; it comes down how much do you trust yourself, and how confident are you in your product or service? </p>
      <p>One thing I agree with Cuban is that you have to have an absolute passion for your business. If you’re in love with what you’re doing, you should wake up every morning ready to work thousand-hour days.</p>
