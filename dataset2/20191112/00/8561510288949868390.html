      <h1>Paralyzed US Veteran Uses Exoskeleton to Complete a Marathon</h1>

      <p>Retired Army Sergeant Terry Hannigan Vereline <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paralyzed-us-veteran-finishes-new-york-city-marathon-using-rewalk-robotic-exoskeleton/">just made history</a> at the 2019 New York City Marathon.</p>
      <p>When she crossed the finish line on November 3, the 65-year-old became the first paralyzed American to successfully complete a marathon — and she did so with the help of a robotic exoskeleton.</p>
      <p>“Words cannot express the feelings I had crossing the finish line,” Vereline said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-paralyzed-american-completes-a-marathon-using-a-rewalk-exoskeleton-300952379.html">press release</a>. “This has been a dream of mine, and I hope I can serve as an inspiration to others that you too can achieve what seems like the impossible — especially all of the disabled children I meet across the country.”</p>
      <p>Vereline served in Vietnam, and when she was in her late-20s, doctors diagnosed her with <a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/sarcoidosis/learn-about-sarcoidosis.html">sarcoidosis</a>, a rare inflammatory disease linked to the chemicals she was exposed to while in the military, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/meet-the-nyc-marathons-amazing-bionic-woman/">according to the <i>NY Post</i></a>.</p>
      <p>By 2011, the disease had paralyzed her from the chest down. The following year, Vereline began using the <a href="https://futurism.com/paralyzed-man-uses-exoskeleton-to-run-race-for-policy-change">ReWalk Robotics</a> exoskeleton, the device she used to complete the marathon over the course of three days.</p>
      <p>“Ever since the day I stood up in the ReWalk for the first time, opportunities I never thought I’d have again were laid out before me,” Vereline said in the press release. “I trained hard, and was able to achieve something amazing. And I am grateful for the chance to be able to stand and walk again every day.”</p>
