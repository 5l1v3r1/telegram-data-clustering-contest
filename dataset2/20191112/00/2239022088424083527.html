      <p>On Saturday, November 9, a new, monumental public artwork by Hank Willis Thomas, titled <i>Unity</i>, was permanently installed near the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. According to the artist, the twenty-two-foot bronze arm and hand whose index finger points up toward the sky is “intended to convey to a wide audience a myriad of ideas about individual and collective identity, ambition, and perseverance.”</p>
      <p>The $284,000 project is also meant to pay homage to the borough’s unique character and is part of a revitalization project that aims to overhaul the Tillary Street corridor in downtown Brooklyn, where a two-way bike lane was recently created. Located at the intersection of Tillary and Adams Street, <i>Unity</i> was commissioned through New York City’s Percent for Art program, which uses one percent of the budget of city-funded construction projects to commission public artworks. </p>
      <p>Managed by the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs, the Percent for Art program has commissioned hundreds of site-specific projects in a variety of media, including painting, mosaic, glass, textiles, and sculpture since its inception in 1982. Currently, more than 125 new projects are in various stages of completion. </p>
