        <b>Valeria Gontareva, whose family has been targeted in car and arson attacks, has linked the unclear events to an Ukrainian oligarch and the nationalisation of Ukraine’s largest bank PrivatBank.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/revenge-ukraine-ex-central-banker-oligarch-attacks">British news portal The Guardian reports</a> that it is possible that when a car drove into Valeria Gontareva at a pedestrian crossing in London, in late August it was merely an accident.</p>
      <p>But soon after, while Gontareva was recovering in hospital, her son’s car was set on fire back home in Kyiv. A few days after that, her family home in the Ukrainian capital was also burned down. For Gontareva there is no doubt that the attacks are part of a disturbing pattern.</p>
      <p>Gontareva made a number of powerful enemies during her reform-minded stint as the head of Ukraine’s central bank. However, she blames the attacks on one person: Ihor Kolomoiskiy, a controversial oligarch from whose control Gontareva wrested the country’s largest bank, PrivatBank.</p>
      <p>He denies responsibility and his supporters have said she is using the London incident as part of a PR campaign.</p>
      <p>Gontareva said she had been threatened, in a jokey fashion, by Kolomoiskiy throughout her tenure at the central bank, a job to which she was appointed in 2014 by the previous president, Petro Poroshenko.</p>
      <h3>«The first thing he said to me was: «Valeria Alexeyevna, you are without any bodyguards. Do you know it only costs $10,000 to have someone killed in this country?»</h3>
      <p>I told him I had bodyguards, which was a lie. And he said: «Ah, with guards it will cost $100k,»» Gontareva said in an interview with the Guardian in London.</p>
      <p>The Guardian reports that the attacks on Gontareva have come as a campaign against her reforms is under way, and as Kolomoiskiy has returned to the country, seeking compensation over the nationalisation of PrivatBank in 2016. Kolomoiskiy previusly owned 49% of the bank.</p>
