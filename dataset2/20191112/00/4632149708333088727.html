      <p><i>He tried to sneak in to watch his favourite hero Prabhas on screen but found a real hero in the police station</i> <br/><br/>Suresh Tarapawar, a 23-year-old orphan was caught sneaking into a cinema hall without a ticket, to watch his favourite hero Prabhas’s movie Saaho. But while he was mooning over a cinema hero, a real-life hero was waiting to give him a new life and a second chance. And how the orphan’s story evolves is much like the story of Saaho, where the audience is kept guessing who the real hero is. <br/><br/>Police inspector, Deelip Kumar of Adugodi police station found Suresh at the station, frightened and expecting the worst. <br/><br/>On questioning Tarapawar, Kumar learnt that the boy was caught by the cinema hall management at Forum Mall and handed over to the police. <br/><br/>Inspector Kumar said, “The first thing I noticed in Tarapawar was his innocence and when I learnt about his past and his struggles, I felt like giving him a chance at a better life. Everyone has a turning point in their life and if he had managed to get inside without a ticket, that would have become a habit. <br/><br/>And each time he would have been emboldened to do a bigger crime He was genuinely regretful of his attempt to enter the cinema hall without a ticket and he did it only because he could not afford to buy one. He told me how difficult his life had been since he came to the city. I gave him food and asked him to work at the police station as housekeeping staff to which he immediately agreed.” <br/><br/>Tarapawar is from Gulbarga and was living in a government hostel until he turned 10. He discontinued his schooling and then started working in a restaurant there to earn a living. Despite working in the restaurant, Tarapawar said he was happy because the job assured him three meals a day and a salary, even if it was very low. He came to the city about six months ago with big dreams of getting a job and living a new life. Suresh said, “From the past six months, I have worked at eight to 10 places in the city but none of them paid me for the work I did. <br/><br/><br/>Whenever I asked them for the money, they would threaten me and make me work some more before kicking me out without pay. I mostly worked at small restaurants and roadside food stalls so that I would get three meals a day. Once in a while I would get tips from customers. I used to sleep on footpaths and in empty grounds. On the day Prabhas’s movie, Saaho, was released, I went to the theatre to simply look around. When I saw the crowds that had gathered to watch the show, I couldn’t stop myself. I really wanted to watch his movie and tried to sneak in saying that I was accompanying someone who was inside. They caught me and handed me over to the manager who threatened to send me to jail and handed me over to the police. I was really scared when I came to the police station but the inspector was kind and gave me a second chance. He even got me a movie ticket to watch the movie that same evening and gave me temporary shelter.” <br/><br/>Tarapawar added that the Inspector gave him a new set of clothes, some food and even a room near the police station to stay. “I feel very safe working here at the police station. Everyone is very helpful and I learn new things every day. I got my first salary of Rs 7,000 recently,” he said. Inspector Dileep Kumar said that he was helping him find another job and would help him open a bank account too. <br/><br/><br/>The incident came to light recently when the Deputy Commissioner of Police (South - East), Isha Pant came to the station for a visit.</p>
