      <p><b>Update</b> <b>7 am MST: </b>Server issues are making it impossible for many subscribers to login and watch content–not all users, but enough that “unable to connect” is a popular search term at the moment. I’m unable to connect on PS4, PC or mobile at this time. Guess I should have stayed up late to watch <i>The Mandalorian . . . </i>but I’ll keep trying.<b>Original Story:</b></p>
      <p>Disney Plus is live, hours before it was slated to launch.</p>
      <p>According to countdown timers, the new Disney subscription service <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/11/heres-the-exact-time-you-can-start-streaming-disney-plus/">wasn’t set to go live until several hours from now</a>. However, I was able to download the app on the Google Play Store, login and start streaming <i>The Mandalorian.</i></p>
      <p>To do this, simply go to the Play Store on your smart device, download the app, and sign in with the email you used to sign up for Disney Plus. I didn’t have a password yet, so I chose the “forgot password” option. A code was sent to my email which I entered, creating a new password and logging in without issue (though I did have to use every possible character in the password form for it to work).</p>
      <p>Once logged in, you can browse content and get straight to watching <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/10/everything-coming-to-disney-plus-at-launch/">the myriad shows, movies and Disney Plus Originals available at launch.</a></p>
      <p>I’m not sure if the app is available yet on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/11/what-devices-are-compatible-with-disney/">all the compatible devices</a>, having only been able to try this on my phone. It’s midnight where I’m at, so maybe the service is simply rolling out at midnight local time. I plan on going to bed at this point and watching <i>The Mandalorian </i>(and exploring the app) first thing in the morning, by which time it should be live across all devices.</p>
      <p>Still, a few hours early is exciting–especially for you night owls. Happy viewing, young padawans!</p>
