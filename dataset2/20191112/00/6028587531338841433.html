      <p>Earlier this year, Google unveiled <a href="https://calljoy.com/">CallJoy</a>, a virtual customer service agent for small businesses which complements its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2019/05/28/25-of-google-duplex-calls-are-placed-by-humans-but-likely-not-for-long/#4d33d788627c">Duplex</a> calling system. The functions were somewhat limited at the time, but now, CallJoy, which emerged through the company's Area 120 incubator, could prove itself a lot more useful.The <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/area-120/calljoy-small-business-virtual-phone-system">latest version of CallJoy</a> includes more automation and customization. Small business owners can decide what it sounds like and exactly what to tell customers when they call. They can provide CallJoy with answers to simple, common questions callers might have after it asks them "How can I help you?" The system can also route calls to the person or department best placed to help a customer, or send callers a text with a link to, for instance, make a reservation or get a quote.</p>
      <p>At the outset, CallJoy was able to answer calls with a custom message and provide basic information, such as business hours. The service also filtered out unwanted spam calls, provided insights and recorded and transcribed calls from the jump. Still, the latest updates should make it somewhat more useful, freeing up entrepreneurs and their employees to spend less time on the phone and more on the business’ operations.</p>
      <p>“Since we launched CallJoy in May, we’ve talked to thousands of small business owners about their needs, specifically, how CallJoy could be more helpful to them,” Bob Summers, general manager of CallJoy, said in a statement. “We took their feedback and put it into our product. Now, CallJoy gives them even more time savings, business insights and control.”</p>
      <p>CallJoy is currently available to businesses in the US for <a href="https://calljoy.com/pricing">$39/month</a> per location, though the service is scalable. It can handle calls from multiple customers simultaneously.</p>
