      <p>Looking to diversify and present Madison Avenue advertisers with a broad live-event platform with which to market their products, New York-based Screenvision Media is launching Screenvision Sports, or SV Sports, a new division that leverages its cinema advertisement model to several sports properties including the New York Mets, Minor League Baseball, ISM Connect (which manages digital fan experiences for NASCAR) and the American Hockey League. The move is projected by Screenvision to provide an audience of more than 40 million for the 2020 season.The deal will see SV Sports in approximately 100 minor league ballparks, 22 NASCAR racetracks and the Mets’ Citi Field as of 2020. The company uses existing video infrastructure – be that large videoboards or smaller video displays that are often seen on concourses – to show rich content throughout the live sporting event experience.</p>

      <p>For Screenvision, the new division is a logical extension as changes to linear television have seen traditional programming wane in the ratings. Live sporting events still retain a solid audience and are therefore favored by advertisers.</p>
      <p>“SV Sports is a natural extension of our core business model, broadening Screenvision’s reach beyond in-cinema to in-venue, while continuing to deliver engaging content to a highly passionate fanbase,” said John Partilla, CEO, Screenvision Media. “Our premium video platform delivers a much-needed solution for Madison Avenue, enabling them to reach a broader audience. In addition, we have a unique model that enables leagues, teams and properties to monetize existing inventory and capture a new and significant source of additional revenue.”</p>
      <p>Partilla said that the move to sports in relationship to their cinema offering was a “strength to strength” move.</p>
      <p>As the growth of streaming has continued, Screenvision continues to sees solid metrics for advertisers around not only cinema, but sports. In creating SV Sports, and Screenvision’s 150-person strong sales staff, they see a way to help blue chip and regional companies that work with Madison Ave. reach a broader audience. SV Sports is creating tailored ad packages for each of the sports properties they are working with leading to a blend of national and regional opportunities for exposure. Examples of ad partners include GEICO, Chevrolet, Verizon, Apple, and State Farm, to name a few.</p>
      <p>Clubs are built on a sponsorship model, but few are built with the staffing required to build out the video sponsorship model. That’s a key function that SV Sports looks to provide.</p>
      <p>“Launching SV Sports gives us tremendous credibility with our advertising partners,” said Eric Krasnoo, SVP Business Development at Screenvision, who is leading the launch of SV Sports. “One of the main reasons we see leagues, clubs, and other sports properties interested in the launch of SV Sports is it creates compelling content which allows for them to grow incremental revenue. We provide a turnkey solution for them.”</p>
      <p>Owned by private equity firm Abry, in 2015 Screenvision’s revenue had just surpassed the $160 million threshold and has since increased by nearly 50%, nearing $250 million. During that time, profit has more than doubled to the $50 million range.</p>
