      <p>Early in my career I was a journalist covering business and politics. It was quickly obvious to me that people who could talk well had a clear advantage. Good thinking was of course important, but it wasn’t enough. They also needed to express their views in cogent, compelling language. And they needed to come across as genuine (today it’s call “authentic”), not playing a role.I later wrote speeches for presidential cabinet officers and U.S Senators. Again, facility with language was of paramount importance. And just being able to read a speech was not enough. Some of their most critical communication was unscripted. </p>
      <p>Then I ran global communication for one of America’s iconic brands, Campbell Soup Company. Again, the theme was consistent. The most effective leaders were the ones who paid the price to be good talkers. I don’t mean they were orators. Some of the best of them were not particularly eloquent. They were simply “real.” They punctuated their messages with relevant stories and believable data. They knew how to connect with people.</p>
      <p>That invaluable prowess is the subject of Jack Modzelewski’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/2CrpJLe"><i>Talk Is Chief: Leadership, Communication &amp; Credibility in a High-Stakes World</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>Jack has more than 35 years of experience with corporate and brand communications for clients in a wide spectrum of companies. After filling senior positions at public relations giant FleishmanHillard, he founded his own firm, JackKnifePR.</p>
      <p>Jack’s views on communication should be studied by anyone who seeks to improve personal and organizational performance.</p>
      <p><b>Rodger Dean Duncan: </b>There’s no doubt that communication skills can help a leader produce good results. But some people seem to think that simply means being glib and fast with words. What do you regard as the critical ingredients in such skills?</p>
      <p><b>Jack Modzelewski: </b>Leaders who consistently lead their organizations to high levels of performance often share best communication practices and traits. They speak authentically and conversationally, even when scripted. They don’t try to earn style points sounding like someone they are not. They repeat important points to make sure they are understood by the widest possible audience. They project confidence and humility. They tell inspiring stories and give real workplace examples to connect with people at all levels of the organization. </p>

      <p>Walmart founder Sam Walton lived by these communication practices. Howard Schultz at Starbucks and Doug Parker at American Airlines do it today.</p>
      <p>Leaders must be prepared to explain why both good and bad things happen to their organizations. Some call that transparency. But it’s sharing lessons from both winning and sometimes losing. Telling people why one strategy worked well while another didn’t.  More importantly, what comes next. Alan Mulally was very good in that regard while leading Ford.    </p>
      <p>Leaders need to compel the organization to both remember and visualize what its highest goals are. For organizations with huge ambitions (so common these days), the leader needs to create a picture of what the end goal is—a visualization that people can relate to in their daily service. The picture can be of happy customers, industry or societal acclaim, or some other worthy goal.</p>
      <p><b>Duncan: </b>What role do a leader’s communication behaviors play in the development of the organization’s culture? </p>
      <p><b>Modzelewski: </b>Culture drives behavior and performance. Leaders define and reinforce cultural imperatives with both their words and actions.  </p>
      <p>At FleishmanHillard we had a clear cultural philosophy. Everyone in the firm—leaders in particular—were expected to live the philosophy. Those values included respecting every person in the organization; putting current customers first; maintaining an entrepreneurial, never-complacent attitude; and working as teams in common cause across all our regions. If we as leaders were not <i>living </i>those values and serving as daily examples of what we expected, the organization would be confused and diminished. We also made our cultural values a big part of employee surveys and feedback on leadership performance. </p>
      <p>A big challenge for leaders today is making their cultural values relevant to thousands of employees, whether in one country or internationally.  A good example of best practice is Laurence Fink, chairman and CEO of the multinational investment firm BlackRock. He expects the same cultural values in every place where his firm does business. To do that well, good leaders know they should be highly visible. They visit offices, operations, and customers. They talk to people working in their stores, factories, labs, and call centers. By circulating through the organization, leaders gain valuable insights and stories to use later in their daily communications.   </p>

      <p><b>Duncan: </b>You say the leader must be the “chief credibility officer.” What does that “look like” from the perspective of others in the organization?</p>
      <p><b>Modzelewski: </b>Credibility starts at the top. A leader’s narrative needs to be consistent inside and outside the organization. You can’t tell shareholders everything is rosy when employees may know otherwise. You are expected to be a corporate cheerleader at company townhall meetings, but facts and straight talk trump hyperbole in maintaining credibility with external stakeholders. Credibility comes down to trusting what leaders say and the roadmaps they present to reach organizational goals or resolve major challenges.  </p>
      <p>Boeing is an example where the CEO has put the company’s reputation on the line by putting out an incomplete narrative about what caused its Boeing 737 Max issues. U.S. senators, during a recent hearing, accused him of everything from underreacting to early warning signs to misleading them. (Credibility gets trashed a lot in Washington.)</p>
      <p><b>Duncan: </b>In a situation like an employee strike (GM comes to mind), how can both the strikers and the company best tell their stories without appearing biased and self-serving?</p>
      <p><b>Modzelewski: </b>The short answer is: on television.  Because that’s where strong spokespeople can use both facts and emotion to persuade the public why their positions are in the <i>public’s</i> best interest. </p>
      <p>Take the recent 15-day strike by teachers in the Chicago Public Schools system. The soundbites led one to conclude that the teachers were underpaid and under resourced, and that the City of Chicago clearly could not afford the union’s demands. Both sides were very persuasive, especially in TV news coverage. Chicago’s mayor and her surrogates were convincing with taxpayers. The Chicago Teachers Union gained the sympathy of school parents and community leaders. But as a strike drags on, both sides’ arguments suffer when the public tunes out. </p>
      <p>Strikes often devolve into finger pointing, each side blaming the other for unfairness, bargaining in bad faith, or breaking past promises. Leaders on both sides of labor disputes must keep calm and communicate clearly about keys to reaching a deal.  </p>
      <p>But the onus is generally on the employer to explain why it can’t afford all of a union’s demands. That’s a more complex story to tell when the employer is a General Motors earning billions of dollars a year while facing expensive challenges of competing in a fiercely competitive, low-margin industry. </p>
