      <h1>Software’s Accelerating Data Needs May Benefit From Intel’s High-Optane Push</h1>

      <p>For all of computing’s advances the past few decades, one aspect that’s remained fairly constant is the fundamental relationship among processors, memory chips, and storage, coupled with software designed to route data where it’s most urgently needed. New memory technology that reached the market this year in response to big computing trends could upend this longstanding choreography among the components that shuttle information around the world’s data centers.</p>

      <p>Many of today’s business applications thrive on supersize datasets that need to be processed in near real time, which means even today’s solid-state drives (SSD) require processors to <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-technology/faster-access-to-more-data-article-brief.html">wait too long for data</a> in storage. At the same time, memory <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-18/intel-s-big-push-behind-its-optane-chip-isn-t-inspiring-analysts">performance gains</a> haven’t kept up with those of either CPUs or storage. Simply packing servers with more memory can be expensive.</p>
      <p>A new kind of server memory from Intel, called <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html">Optane DC Persistent Memory</a>, can transmit information to a CPU nearly as fast as DRAM memory, and is available at lower prices. Optane persistent memory can simultaneously act as storage, retaining information when a computer’s power is off—something DRAM can’t do.</p>
      <p>The result could be systems that feed data-hungry processors with information more quickly for rendering split-second decisions to <a href="https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSMA-Security-Threat-Landscape-31.1.19.pdf">detect threats in telecom networks</a>, execute computerized stock trading, personalize ecommerce sites based on up-to-the-second trends, and crunch expansive datasets for artificial intelligence, says Ashish Ray, vice president of product management for Exadata at Oracle. When servers in modern data centers periodically need rebooting, they could load databases from Optane persistent memory more quickly after restarting than they could from disk, so websites and enterprise systems don’t miss a beat.</p>
      <p>“For the past 50 years the architecture of computing hasn’t changed that much,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghavanananth/">Ananth Raghavan</a>, vice president for <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/related/timesten.html?source=:ex:nc:::RC_WWMK180119P00044:TimesTendatabase&amp;SC=:ex:nc:::RC_WWMK180119P00044:TimesTendatabase&amp;pcode=WWMK180119P00044">Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database</a>. “There is the promise of supporting much larger databases than we can today at a much lower price. Much more memory is available for you to do computing.”</p>
      <p>Software makers are updating their products to take advantage of the speed and availability gains Optane offers, spanning areas from <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/exadata/persistent-memory-accelerator">data processing for business</a> to making <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/memory-storage/optane-persistent-memory/cern-algorithm-efficiency-video.html">supercomputing algorithms</a> more efficient.</p>

      <p>Oracle in September made available a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oow19-oracle-unleashes-worlds-fastest-database-machine-091619.html">new version</a> of its <a href="https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/exadata/database-machine/?source=:ex:nc:::RC_WWMK180119P00044:OptaneExadata&amp;SC=:ex:nc:::RC_WWMK180119P00044:OptaneExadata&amp;pcode=WWMK180119P00044">Exadata Database Machine, called X8M</a>, that includes Optane persistent memory. The integrated system consisting of servers, storage devices, networking, and the Oracle Database can read data directly from Optane chips in its storage servers as if it were memory over a superfast connection, leading to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oow19-oracle-intel-partner-optane-exadata-091619.html">10 times less latency</a> than in the prior version of Exadata. Optane memory fits into servers’ standard dual in-line memory module (DIMM) connections and works in conjunction with Intel’s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/cascade-lake/2nd-gen-intel-xeon-scalable-processors.html?wapkw=xeon+cascade+lake">latest Xeon Scalable processors</a>, which had been code-named “Cascade Lake.”</p>
      <p>The next version of the Oracle Database, called 20c and due next year, will also support Optane, executive vice president Andy Mendelsohn said in a keynote address at Oracle OpenWorld. Since Optane-capable systems can store several terabytes of data in memory, 20c will include new algorithms for handling in-memory databases, with less need to periodically shift data to slower magnetic disks.</p>
      <p>Oracle has also demonstrated its <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/related/timesten.html">TimesTen In-Memory Database</a> running on Optane and loading a 2.7 terabyte database from memory in <a href="https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/oracle-open-world-2018/#gs.9l3i73">less than half a second</a>, versus 13 minutes for a database half that size using a combination of DRAM and flash storage. The Optane system also saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfBb2zISi1o&amp;feature=youtu.be">a 6.5 times improvement</a> in the number of transactions per second it was able to perform. The TimesTen group is running performance benchmark tests on a database of more than 5 terabytes held in persistent memory, and next year plans to ship the ability for an in-memory database to instantly restart after a shutdown.</p>
      <p>“The best thing is, it works without the business needing to rewrite software,” says <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/holger-mueller">Holger Mueller</a>, an analyst at Constellation Research. “Optane lets your existing system run faster. That will be the biggest initial use case.” Software makers and businesses will be able to rewrite their applications for even greater speedups, but Optane persistent memory also works on software without any special tuning.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Best of DRAM and Flash</b>
      </p>
      <p>Memory comes in two essential types, each with different strengths. Dynamic random access memory can read and write data quickly, but doesn’t store it when a computer’s power is cut. Flash memory, based on technology called NAND (which stands for “not and,” a type of logic gate) is slower but retains data when off. That’s made these solid-state NAND devices a substitute in some cases for slower magnetic disks.</p>
      <p>Optane memory can store data like flash and read and write it <a href="https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/intel-optane-dc-persistent-memory-operating-modes/#gs.8io1a0">nearly as fast as DRAM</a>: The technology provides latency of 10 millionths of a second, compared with 80 microseconds for SSD.</p>
      <p>That’s important as more enterprise applications and data analysis software store increasingly large datasets, and more so-called “hot” data needs to be accessed quickly by memory. The longer a computer’s CPU spends waiting for data, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-technology/balancing-bandwidth-and-latency-article-brief.html">fewer cycles that are available</a> to execute users’ requests. “As CPU performance has increased over time, storage latency has not kept pace, becoming a drag on overall system performance gains,” Intel said in a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-technology/balancing-bandwidth-and-latency-article-brief.html">technical paper</a>.</p>
      <p>For instance, financial firms need to continually <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-technology/faster-access-to-more-data-article-brief.html">correlate trading data</a> with historical data, storing databases in computer memory for real-time insights. According to Intel, these institutions can use Optane to establish a non-volatile “hot tier” of data that’s quickly available, instead of moving it between DRAM and SSDs.</p>
      <p>To be sure, data can <a href="https://itpeernetwork.intel.com/intel-optane-dc-persistent-memory-operating-modes/#gs.a08cki">still be erased</a> absent power when Optane is running in memory mode. Data persistence is enabled by what Intel calls “App Direct mode,” which either requires software developers to rewrite their applications, or an operating system that supports the technology.</p>
      <p>Some Oracle competitors in cloud computing infrastructure and applications have also been offering Optane to their customers. But it’s still unclear whether the technology will find its place as a new tier of computer architecture, versus just being a faster storage option, says analyst Mueller.</p>
      <p>Optane technology could nonetheless simplify software over time, which observers say is another benefit. Programmers generally gain performance by loading data into memory. But other algorithms in a system need to periodically write it back to disk. That back-and-forth of data costs computing cycles and leads to more complex software. Since data on disk needs to be stored in a different format, a program can’t quickly point to a specific byte address to retrieve it.</p>
      <p>Optane solves those problems since <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-technology/faster-access-to-more-data-article-brief.html">it’s byte-addressable,</a> and can immediately boost the amount of memory available from 1.5 terabytes to 6 terabytes or more on a two-socket server with Xeon Scalable chips. “We’re in a new world in which more and more will be stored in memory, which lets the TimesTen In-Memory Database store far more information,” says Oracle’s Raghavan. “Software can actually be made less complex.”</p>
