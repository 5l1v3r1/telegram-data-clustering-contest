      <h1>Bithumb Global Launches Native Token for Exchange Ecosystem</h1>

      <p>Bithumb Global has launched a native coin for Bithumb Chain, the exchange’s custom blockchain.</p>
      <p>Launched under the “BT” ticker, Bithumb Coin will work as a medium of exchange for the ecosystem, the company told CoinDesk in a statement Tuesday. The Bithumb Chain itself is expected to launch <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bithumb-wants-user-created-dexs-with-its-new-blockchain-ecosystem">sometime in the first quarter</a> of 2020.</p>
      <p>From a mechanics side, the exchange will mint a hard cap of 300 million Bithumb Coins. Half of the exchange’s revenue will be used to burn 50 percent of BT’s token supply over time – similar to Binance Chain’s Binance Coin (BNB) – resulting in a final 150 million token supply. Initial token distribution will be split between on-exchange incentives and chain development, moreover.</p>
      <p>Bithumb says the exchange will utilize the coin for handling fees, rights to use Bithumb Chain and future payment mechanisms. Earlier this month, the exchange announced its “Exchange-as-a-Service” feature to develop decentralized finance applications or decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols using Bithumb Chain as a backbone.</p>
      <p>Bithumb says its tokens can be used to vote in chain governance, such as investment decisions, for Bithumb Chain.</p>
      <p>A part of Bithumb Korea, one of South Korea’s largest exchanges, Bithumb Global operates out of Singapore with an average daily trade volume of nearly $700 million, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bithumb-global/">Coinmarketcap</a>.</p>
