      <p>GameStop might be on the ropes as a retailer, but it’s still alive and kicking for the time being. And that means its going to be doing its best on Black Friday, when the video game-specific retailer typically wants to make itself one of the better places to grab video game deals even before Thanksgiving typically happens. We haven’t seen the ad yet, but we have an idea of what to expect having looked at other stores and historical precedent. Here’s what I imagine we’ll see with regards to PS4, Switch and Xbox One. <b>Blanket bonus</b>: Last year, GameStop offered a $50 GameStop gift card to anyone that bought a new current-gen console. That was particularly valuable for the Nintendo Switch, which didn’t have any actual deals that dropped below its MSRP of $299.99. A gift card still doesn’t do that, but it did mean that GameStop was one of the better places to buy a Switch, next to a similar idea from Kohl’s.</p>
      <p>I’d expect to see something similar this year, making GameStop an ideal place to pick up Nintendo’s rarely-discounted hardware. I don’t know if it will be the same $50 or what, but I would expect some sort of GameStop credit with console purchases.</p>

      <p><b>Nintendo Switch:</b> We already know what Nintendo’s major bundle is this year: it’s a <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> bundle for $299.99, same as last year. It’s even the same, lower-battery life SKU as last year, so beware of that. Where the Switch Lite is concerned, I wouldn’t expect to see any discounts at all.</p>
      <p>GameStop could always throw in an accessory, but expect any additional discount to come from some sort of store credit deal and not contained within the actual package.</p>
      <p><b>PS4:</b> The flagship bundle for PS4 this year is a $200 1 tb PS4 Slim with <i>God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn </i>and <i>The Last of Us Remastered</i>. We’ve seen this elsewhere, and I expect to see it at GameStop too. This is really, really good, at least if you like single-player games. It would be worth the price of admission if you never played another game. But you could play another game! Even better.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, we’ll likely see some discounts on other bundles that GameStop has extras of for whatever reasons, as well as whatever blanket discount we see for everything. I wouldn’t be surprised to see something from the world of sports, something with a shooter, something with VR, and likely the special <i>Fortnite</i> bundle too.</p>
      <p><b>Xbox One:</b> I’d expect Microsoft to get a little more aggressive than Sony, which it’s been doing for a few years. At this point, this is mostly because Microsoft wants people involved with the ecosystem and signed up for Game Pass before the launch of both Scarlett and Xcloud, both of which are expected to use the company’s extant subscription services.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen an impressive $200 <i>Jedi Fallen Order</i> bundle elsewhere, which I’d expect to see show up at GameStop as well. I’d expect something with an all-digital console bundle with a Game Pass subscription at a similar price point as well: there’s no real need to do bundles with first-party games, because they’re all on Game Pass anyways.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, we’ll likely see other bundles: something with Madden, most likely, and likely something with Call of Duty, which we’ve already seen in an early bundle from Walmart.</p>
      <p><b>Game Deals:</b> And then, of course, the game deals. These are typically too numerous and various to predict ahead of time, but expect a slight discount on new blockbusters like <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i>, but nothing major. Last year’s titles will all be on clearance, however, hitting the shelves for something like $30 or less. And from before that? Things will get basically free. You can get a ton of older games for like $15 or less on Black Friday, which is a great way to remind yourself that playing at launch is usually a tough argument to make, especially for single-player games.</p>
