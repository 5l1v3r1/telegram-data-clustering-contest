      <p>I just learned there is a bell-shaped curve on the age of adoption of stuffed animals. The young have always loved them and now people on the older end of the age spectrum are adopting them as well.  Many older adults continue to have cherished <i>live </i>pets–in single family home and in retirement communities. In fact, in recent years, most retirement communities, including assisted independent living, have dramatically loosened the restrictions on pets. Where restrictions used to limit pet residents to a single pet and less than 30 pounds, I now see larger dogs and multiple dogs and cats in one unit.</p>
      <p>I think that’s all good. There is little remaining doubt that a companion animal is terrific for so many aspects of retirement. They require regular exercise (or at least a trip outside to do their business), feeding, and health care, all of which add structure, meaning, and purpose to an older adult’s life. However, circumstances sometimes change in the life of a senior and they may reach a point where a live animal is just too much to manage, physically and/or mentally. </p>
      <p>I watched this happen to my mother. While residing in an independent living community in Palm Desert, California, she had a small dog as her live-in companion.  She adored that dog and took good care of him for six years. Then she started showing signs of dementia. For a while, her ability to care for “Pinkie” seemed to hold up, but when a housekeeper found signs that she was neglecting to take her outside, my siblings and I decided it was time to re-home the dog.  Pinkie went to live with my brother. Occasionally my mother would ask about her, but no sooner had she asked than the memory was gone again. </p>
      <p>At the time, I had nothing to replace Pinkie. Today, I would immediately get her a <a href="https://joyforall.com/">Joy For All</a> “Companion Pup.” Joy For All is part of Ageless Innovation, the company that produces stuffed animals for older adults. Originally, it was a division of Hasbro and was created as an initiative to leverage the company’s assets in new markets. Focusing on the health and wellness arena, their market research led them to the conclusion that there was a need for products that bring fun and play to older adults. With that market insight and feedback from aging adults in their families, they brought forth a line of animated companion pets. Two years later, the JoyForAll team left Hasbro and founded Ageless Innovation, the company that now produces the companion pet line.</p>
      <p>The Companion Pup is a perfect size for an older person to cuddle, with a realistic soft coat (synthetic fur, of course).  Its robotic enhancements include a simulated heartbeat and authentic pet noises.  It can turn its head and respond to sound just like a real dog. <a href="https://joyforall.com/">Ageless Innovation</a> also produces the “Companion Cat,” a beautiful, soft life-like toy that responds to petting, and hugging with a purring sound. </p>
      <p>I encountered my first toy companion animal in the expo hall at the <a href="https://www.leadingage.org/">LeadingAge</a> conference in San Diego last month.  I’m a dog person, so of course I was most interested in the Companion Pup. I must say, it is pretty compelling.  Missing cuddling with my own dog while I was away that week at the conference, I was drawn to the booth with the stuffed animals, as were many others in the exhibit hall that afternoon. They had a handful of demo toys in the booth, so several of us got to cuddle with the animated pets at the same time.  </p>
      <p>The cats come in several different colors, all meant to replicate real cats: orange tabby, silver with white, and black and white tuxedo. They have sensors at several different places on their bodies, which is how they respond to petting and cuddling with a purring sensation that Ageless Innovations calls “Vibrapurr.” The more the cat is touched, the more they respond, eventually rolling over on their back to get a belly rub(!). They also have a light sensor embedded near their head so they can close their eyes and “go to sleep” when they are not being stimulated.</p>
      <p>The pup will actually nuzzle the hand that is doing the petting and emit puppy-like noises when it hears someone talk to it. Like the cat, the pup will close its eyes to simulate sleeping when it hasn’t been touched for a few minutes. All Companion Pups are a golden color at this time, like a yellow lab or a golden retriever. </p>
      <p>JoyForAll is not the only company in this market. I also found <a href="https://www.mypetsies.com/">Petsies</a>, a company that creates a custom stuffed animal that resembles a cherished live (or previously living) pet. These copies are soft, life-like, and loveable and they are able to create them from a photograph of the living pet. Another site, <a href="https://memorablepets.com/">Memorable Pets</a>, displays a variety of gifts for people with dementia and has several options for ordering stuffed animals, They feature the JoyForAll companion pets as well as items from other manufacturers.  </p>
      <p>JoyForAll appears to be the leader in the market, especially for stuffed animals with robotic enhancements. I’m going to take one to a dear friend who has been living with dementia for 15 years.  She no longer recognizes me, but I bet she will know and love her new CompanionPup for the rest of her life. </p>
