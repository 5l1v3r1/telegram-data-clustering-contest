      <h1>“Towards Abstraction” at Bailly Gallery, Paris</h1>

      <p>Bailly Gallery in Paris is currently hosting “Towards Abstraction,” an exhibition that traces the development of abstract forms through various artistic movements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It features works by such Modernist masters as <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/georges-braque-1279556">Georges Braque</a>, <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/5263-fernand-leger">Fernand Leger</a>, <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/serge-poliakoff-146208">Serge Poliakoff</a>, Hans Hartung, <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/sam-francis-75">Sam Francis</a>, and Maria Elena Vieira Da Silva, and runs through November 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the gallery, “Towards Abstraction” playfully combines and juxtaposes works of early Cubists, such as <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/georges-braque-1279556">Georges Braque</a>, <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/5263-fernand-leger">Fernand Leger</a>, or <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/henri-laurens-105365">Henri Laurens</a>, who broke the bonds with artistic mimesis, with the expressive lyrism of Hans Hurtung and the audacious combinations of colors and shapes of <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/serge-poliakoff-146208">Serge Poliakoff</a>, <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/sam-francis-75">Sam Francis</a> and <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/58406-maurice-esteve">Maurice Esteve</a>.”</p>
      <p>One of the earliest works on show is <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/henri-laurens-105365">Henri Laurens</a>’ bronze, “Femme à L'éventail” (cast 1919). Recognized for his depictions of the female figure, Laurens’ study of the angularity of the reclining nude condenses the body into its essential shapes. The work on display is an austere Cubist treatment of the human form.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/5263-fernand-leger">Fernand Leger</a>’s “Composition au Compass” (1932) is one of the show’s highlights. According to the release, it is a testament to Leger’s contrary nature that he pursued oil painting whilst many of his contemporaries were beginning to branch into photography or the Ready-made. His subject matter, however, was less conservative – here he abstracts the technical processes of his time through highly expressive shapes and colors.</p>
      <p>Also on view is <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/georges-braque-1279556">Georges Braque</a>’s “Uranie” (1942), a painting that stands apart from the artist’s regular Cubist still lives, depicting instead enigmatic symbols. Most prominent amongst these is a wide-eyed feminine profile, a recurrent motif in Braque’s oeuvre which pertains to Urania, the muse of Astrology and Astronomy in Greek mythology. The star in the corner above is taken to refer to The Star of David, in the context of its appropriation for oppressive tactics by then-contemporary Nazi rulers in Germany.</p>
      <p>The exhibition takes us through the decades to <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/serge-poliakoff-146208">Serge Poliakoff</a>’s “Composition Abstraite” (1963), an abstract work of balance and harmony. Poliakoff’s subtle interplay of tensions between blocks of vibrant colors creates a delicate rhythm that speaks to his friendship with, and influence from, Kandinsky.</p>
      <p>Produced in the same decade, <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/sam-francis-75">Sam Francis</a>’ “SF64-045” (1964) is an abstraction of the artist’s impressions after traveling around Japan, Mexico, the United States, and Paris. His visit to Japan coincided with the motif of open white space appearing frequently in his work. It is thought that this was sparked by appropriated notions of “empty” and “full” derived from Asian ink painting, as well as Francis’ interest in Zen Buddhism.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/58406-maurice-esteve">Maurice Esteve</a>'s “Hottie” (1978), also on view, is unique in the artist’s oeuvre for its round shape. In the words of the gallery, “The overall composition of the mostly jagged monochrome image fields is heavily structured and intensely colored. In spite of its strongly abstracted shape, the only two semi-circular fields appear to hint at a woman's body.” The combination of the palette of warm, harmonious colors “make the hotness of the woman tangible on a metaphysical level.”</p>
