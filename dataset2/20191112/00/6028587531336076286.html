      <h1>How Luxury French Brand, Dice Kayek, Defines Modern Couture.</h1>

      <p>It was an idea of a white shirt that launched the collection of Dice Kayek 27 years ago in Paris. But not just any white shirt; a white shirt, made from strong Egyptian cotton, adorned with hand crafted roses and white leaves embroidered with metal insects and sewn spiders to create a lifelike “balance of beauty and ugliness.” Inspired by their childhood garden in Bursa, Turkey, and the city’s rich heritage of textiles and embroidery, the first collection was a celebration of the high quality materials of cotton and of its durability and luster. For Ece Ege, one of the sisters of the award-winning duo that forms Dice Kayek, creating sculptural pieces highlighted the resiliency of the pure raw materials.</p>

      <p>“ I wanted these shirts to have presence, form, and structure. These shirts have always been the corner stone of my inspiration. Like a canvas or a block of clay, it is a starting point to layer and build my vocabulary.”</p>
      <p>The inaugural shirt collection was met with critical acclaim and as the sisters began adding more garments and silhouettes, their ready to wear collection began to take on more depth and intricacy, requiring additional experimentation with cutting and folding, elevating the elaborate pieces to a couture-like status from all the hand worked details involved.</p>
      <p>As Ece described the design experience, “ The fabrics began to dictate and the dresses spoke for themselves.”</p>

      <p>Receiving accolades and recognitions from global press, the sisters would continue with their modern couture collection culminating in their Istanbul Contract Exhibition, a seminal collection focused on the symbols of Istanbul’s diverse cultural history as part of a celebratory exhibition of Turkey at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.</p>
      <p>“The Istanbul Contrast Exhibitions were a pivotal moment for me as it was Haute Couture in the purest sense. And it encapsulated my core loves of art and fashion,” says Ece.</p>
      <p>The gallant reception of the Istanbul Contract Haute Couture Collection launched an international traveling exhibition where the collection was on display in Istanbul’s Modern Art Museum, the Amsterdam Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p>
      <p>Dice Kayek continued to show couture in Paris for several seasons, then decided to shift focus and return to ready to wear.</p>

      <p>While their return to ready to wear signals a more attainable experience, for sisters Ayce and Ece, it was an opportunity to continue to play with their instinctive theories of design showcased in their ornate sculptural garments. The themes of strength, discipline, the contrasts between love and tension, the noble ideal of the fight against gravity, and the celebration of textiles and embroidery, inherent to their DNA, are palpable in their elaborate pieces. The sisters refer to their aesthetic as “post romantic.”</p>
      <p>Dice Kayek’s ready to wear collection continues to bear their signature embellished details and artisan craftsmanship of an Haute Couture collection, without the structure of multiple fittings and long wait times.</p>
      <p>“People won’t wait for three months for a garment, anymore. They want to come in to a store, do individual appointments with something they see in the boutique, make minor adjustments and go home. It’s part of the new luxury and modern couture experience.”</p>

      <p>This past September, Dice Kayek opened their flagship boutique in Paris, Saint Germain, the neighborhood where the sisters have taken residence for the past 20 years, as they traveled between Istanbul and Paris. Designed by Belgian architect, Bernard Dubois, the boutique represents the opportunity to immerse clients into the Dice Kayek world. The interior, a minimal canvas of green and pink marble, contrasts well with the lavishness of the collections.</p>
      <p>A private boudoir welcomes VIP clients where Turkish teas and delights are served, an offering of cultural hospitality as part of the shared experience between their native country and their adopted home.</p>
