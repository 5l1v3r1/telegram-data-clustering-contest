      <h1>Scientists: SpaceX Satellites Threaten “Astronomy Itself”</h1>
      <h2>"If there are lots and lots of bright moving objects in the sky, it tremendously complicates our job."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/victor" target="_blank">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>Elon Musk-led spacetech company SpaceX wants to bring broadband internet to everybody on the planet by launching tens of thousands of small “Starlink” satellites to low Earth orbit.</p>
      <p>The Federal Communications Commission already gave SpaceX permission to operate a maximum of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/spacex-files-paperwork-to-launch-up-to-30000-more-starlink-global-internet-satellites/">30,000 of them</a> — eight times as many satellites as are currently in orbit, <a href="http://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers">according to the European Space Agency</a>. The company is rapidly rolling the network out: yesterday, it <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/watch-spacex-launch-60-starlink-satellites">launched 60 more Starlink satellites</a> into orbit, bringing up the total to just 120 so far. 24 deployments are still planned to roll out global internet service by 2021.</p>
      <p>And that has many astronomers worried, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/science/spacex-starlink-satellites.html"><i>The New York Times</i> reports</a>. Not only could the satellites interfere with radio wavelengths of sensitive equipment used by astronomers, but they’re already proving to be brighter than expected.</p>
      <p>Thousands of extremely bright satellites could make it look “as if the whole sky is crawling with stars,” Smith College astronomer James Lowenthal told the <i>Times.</i> Worse, they could end up interfering with dark sky surveys and large telescopes.</p>
      <p>“If there are lots and lots of bright moving objects in the sky, it tremendously complicates our job,” Lowenthal told the <i>Times</i>. “It potentially threatens the science of astronomy itself.”</p>
      <p>Chief scientist Anthony Tyson from the University of California, Davis, also argued that photobombing satellites could cause survey telescopes to pick up bright streaks of light.</p>
      <p>“It’s really a mess,” Tyson said.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time SpaceX’s controversial project has received criticism from scientists. Earlier this year, <i>Scientific American</i> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacexs-starlink-could-cause-cascades-of-space-junk/">reported</a> that Starlink could end up causing “cascades of space junk.”</p>
      <p>In June, the International Astronomical Union, made up of more than 12,000 astronomy professionals, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/astronomers-regulation-spacex-starlink-satellites">called</a> for the regulation of SpaceX’s Starlink initiative, arguing that it could interfere with space exploration efforts.</p>
