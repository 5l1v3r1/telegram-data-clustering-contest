      <p>HILO, Hawaii (AP) - The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources is expected to seek funding from the state Legislature to establish ocean access at a boat ramp cut off by the Kilauea eruption, officials said.</p>
      <p>The Pohoiki boat ramp facility on the Big Island closed shortly after Kilauea began erupting in May 2018, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported .</p>
      <p>The only ramp between Hilo and Milolii became landlocked by a black sand and cobblestone beach and affected the ability of fishermen to access the ocean, officials said.</p>
      <p>A short-term proposal involves driving sheet-pile walls into the ground on either side of the ramp entrance and dredging the channel to provide temporary ocean access, said Dan Dennison, a Department of Land and Natural Resources spokesman.</p>
      <p>The department has requested the release of $500,000 from the state’s fiscal year 2020-21 budget, Dennison said.</p>

      <p>The state likely would have to prepare an environmental assessment and obtain the necessary permits for the work, according to the Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation.</p>
      <p>The department estimated a cost of $8 million to $9 million.</p>
      <p>A long-term solution under consideration involves a new boat ramp on the north side of Pohoiki Bay. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is reviewing that proposal, which is estimated to cost $28 million, Dennison said.</p>
      <p>“Implementation of either the short-term or long-term projects will of course depend on whether funding becomes available,” Dennison said.</p>
