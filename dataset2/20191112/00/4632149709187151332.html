      <p><b>LA PAZ</b>Bolivian President <b>Evo Morales</b>(pictured) has resigned after three weeks of sometimes violent protests over his disputed re-election, as his allies denounced an alleged coup. <br/><br/>“I resign my post as president,” the leftist Morales said Sunday in a televised address. The streets of La Paz immediately exploded in celebration, but violence and vandalism later erupted overnight. <br/><br/><br/>In the confusion, a group of 20 lawmakers and government officials took refuge at the Mexican ambassador's residence, and Mexico announced it was offering asylum to Morales as well. <br/><br/>Armed Forces chief Williams Kaliman told reporters he was asking Morales “to resign his presidential mandate to allow for pacification and the maintaining of stability.” <br/><br/><br/>Opposition senator, Jeanine Anez, said on Sunday she would assume the interim presidency of Bolivia.</p>
