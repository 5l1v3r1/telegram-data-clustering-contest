      <h1>Let them eat cake: Your heels or mine?</h1>

      <p><i>By Namrata Zakaria</i> <br/><br/>KARAN Johar may have raised a few eyebrows when he showed up in a gorgeous pair of high-heeled boots at a women’s awards show a couple of weeks ago. But this columnist barely batted her bat-winged eyelid. Not that one expects him to be gimmicky; Johar has long crossed over the line from ‘dressing to tease’ to ‘dressing for his own pleasure’, with his penchant for being unarguably the most-fashion forward male in the movie business. <br/><br/>At the other end of the globe, American fashion designer Marc Jacobs has been making news for the past few months for wearing women’s heels in public. He first wore red Prada heels at the VMA in August this year, and followed it up by the same Rick Owens hiking boots that Johar had worn in September and October. <br/><br/>But both Jacobs and Johar are men who live by their own rules, as far as the laws of their lands will allow them to. Jacobs is famously political: he launched a line of menswear called Stinky Rat inspired by George W Bush, and he recently married his lover Char Defrancesco. Johar has famously had children as a single man. Gender and sexuality are mere traditional constructs to these men. <br/><br/>But men wearing heels is hardly a new thing. Fashion historians show that the first to wear heels were actually men, not women. The first pair of heels was military footwear in West Asia. Men on horseback wore heels to hook to their stirrups and give them balance, as they raised their bodies to shoot arrows. The Shah of Persia had sent some emissaries to Europe, which is when the continent discovered the heel. In the 1600s, men wore heels to appear manly, formidable and, well, taller. French king Louis XIV famously wore red heels in court to appear taller, and since all of French and European fashion arose from his court, heels were everywhere. <br/><br/>Women started emulating men’s shoes because it gave them a little swing in their walk. Women’s feet were barely visible, so the men almost never knew their footwear was being copied. By the time the men had cottoned on to women wearing heels, it was the 1700s. Philosophers were studying rationalism and had ordained that men were thinkers, while women were emotional and sentimental. Thus rational men needed rational footwear, and the women got to keep the heel. High heels became so high for women that some of the Italian ladies needed maids to support them even as they teetered around in their stilettos. By the 1860s, photography was invented. Women began to be photographed in their shoes and soon enough the heel became a sexualised thing. <br/><br/>High heels are now a political conversation. Several women have abandoned them, deeming them as torturously painful and catering to the male gaze. Celebrity women have criticised why female actors have to spend hours wearing uncomfortable heels on the red carpet and at events, while the men are far cosier in their shiny flat shoes. <br/><br/>The glamorisation of streetwear by American musicians has brought sneakers into high fashion. It’s been a few years now that women have been wearing stylish trainers everywhere – from work to lunch to afterhours – especially with runners getting an upgrade with jewels and embroidery on them. These have given a lot of fashionable women the option of upchucking the heel for an equally chic and far more comfortable option. Deepika Padukone famously slipped into her trainers at her Mumbai wedding reception to dance all night long, as did Justin Bieber’s model bride Hailey Baldwin. And Indian designers like Monisha Jaising have started making sparkly bejewelled sneakers to wear under lehengas. <br/><br/>Last week, several cities in the USA organised a ‘Walk a Mile in her Shoes’ event where men were encouraged to walk in women’s shoes to raise awareness and funds for domestic violence victims. The walk is a part of the International Men’s March to stop rape, sexual assault and gender violence. <br/><br/><br/>According to a local newspaper in Georgia, USA, the walkers take a pledge that they will honour women in their relationships and avoid controlling behaviour and any form of violence against them. <br/><br/>In antipodal Japan, women are protesting for being forced to wear heels to work. Earlier this year, Japanese women began voicing their discontent with arcane workplace restrictions on their looks through the #KuToo movement. This came about as many companies still require their women employees to wear high heels to work. The term #KuToo plays on kutsu (shoes), kutsuu (pain), and the #MeToo movement. Last week, some Japanese companies banned women from wearing glasses. Airlines cited safety reasons, beauty companies said they wanted to show off their makeup, while others said glasses made women look cold and less appealing. The day for women to wear sneakers to work is still a long way. <br/><br/><br/>But are women and men exchanging shoes now, after switching clothes, to announce reinforced gender fluidity? Perhaps. The idea of unisex fashion is here to stay, blurring lines for what is ‘normal’ in either gender.</p>
