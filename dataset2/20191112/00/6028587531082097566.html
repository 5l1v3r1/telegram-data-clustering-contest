      <p>The only thing some boxing purists hated more than the KSI vs. Logan Paul rematch was the amount of attention the battle of the YouTubers received. If they haven’t heard what the two internet celebrities earned from main-eventing the DAZN card in Los Angeles on Saturday, their stomachs are about to turn.KSI and Logan Paul each earned $900,000 for their part in the six-round cruiserweight bout that ended with a split-decision win for the former. We haven’t seen the numbers on DAZN subscriptions or the viewership that was generated, but if the social media engagement was any indication, and we know that it is, there were a number of interested fans across the world.</p>
      <p>The results tweet from DAZN USA’s Twitter account generated more than 126K user interactions:</p>
      <p>KSI and Paul <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/boxing/10314467/ksi-logan-paul-money-youtube/">reportedly also earned a portion of the ticket sales and the DAZN subscriptions</a> they helped to generate. Even without that, the headliners dwarfed the purses of almost every other fighter on the card, and that includes 168-pound champion Billy Joe Saunders.</p>
      <p>Devin Haney earned $1 million for his title defense against Alfredo Santiago, but it’s unlikely he got any share of ticket sales or DAZN subscriptions</p>
      <p>Depending on what those shares turn out to be, it’s very possible KSI and Paul will rake in more than fighters like David Benavidez, Anthony Dirrell and others who have held enviable spots on recent boxing cards.</p>
      <p>Love it or hate it, there is no denying the interest KSI and Paul generated. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/11/10/ksi-vs-logan-paul-results-winner-highlights-and-twitter-reaction/#2482c95c4806">The article</a> I wrote that recapped the fight had been viewed more than 63,000 times at the time of this article, while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/11/07/ksi-vs-logan-paul-date-time-tv-and-live-stream-info/#6092f0a51075">the preview</a> was read 44,000 times. That was three times as much as Canelo Alvarez vs. Sergey Kovalev and even more than the same articles written about UFC 244 which featured the popular “BMF” title fight.</p>
      <p>Based on the interest generated and the money earned, I’d expect to see a few more celebrity boxing matches sometime soon.</p>
