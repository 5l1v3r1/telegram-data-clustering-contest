      <h1>Provocative Atlantic asks how civil war can be avoided</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DAVID BAUDER</a></address>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic/">Atlantic</a> magazine was founded in the years leading up to the Civil War, so it’s worth noting when it produces a special new issue on the theme, “How to stop a Civil War.”</p>
      <p>The issue went to newsstands and its articles were posted online Tuesday, the day before the House begins public impeachment hearings on President Donald Trump, timing both fortuitous and coincidental.</p>
      <p>“It seemed fairly obvious that a magazine of the American idea should look hard at the question of whether the country is coming apart,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-goldberg/">Jeffrey Goldberg</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic/">Atlantic</a>’s editor.</p>
      <p>He’s not comparing the current era to November 1857, when the first Atlantic issue was published, “but it does feel that something has come off the rails a little bit,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-goldberg/">Goldberg</a> said.</p>
      <p>Among the pieces in the new issue are Yoni Appelbaum’s look at the impact of demographic changes, where nonwhites will soon become a majority; Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose-Stockwell’s report on the destabilizing effect of social media; and Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja’s examination of a political system that increasingly punishes moderate viewpoints.</p>

      <p>“We have political and media and technological systems that reward extremism,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-goldberg/">Goldberg</a> said.</p>
      <p>Trump is a symptom of what has been happening to the country, not the cause, the editor said.</p>
      <p>Lest the issue seem unrelentingly negative, it also contains a wistful piece by author Tom Junod on how Mister Rogers might react to the current times, and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda explores the impact of art in a troubled era.</p>
      <p>While Atlantic writers offer some suggestions on how to get beyond current problems, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-goldberg/">Goldberg</a> cautioned that “it’s not the job of journalists to make you feel better. It’s the job of journalists to tell you what’s going on.”</p>

        <p>It may seem quaint to think a magazine with a paid circulation of 450,000 could have an impact on the national conversation. But that measurement is a reflection of another time, too. The Atlantic’s website has 30 million unique visitors a month, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-goldberg/">Goldberg</a> said.</p>
        <p>The magazine has been growing, adding 80 new positions since announcing an expansion in February 2018. It launched a new digital subscription plan with three tiers of service in September. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlantic/">Atlantic</a> said its digital revenue growth has thus far exceeded expectations.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-goldberg/">Goldberg</a> said the response indicates a desire for carefully reported and edited long-form journalism.</p>
        <p>“Our desire is to inform and contextualize and argue and provoke all at the same time,” he said.</p>
        <p>The new issue also coincides with a redesign of both the magazine and website. The December issue’s cover image is a red and blue handprint.</p>
