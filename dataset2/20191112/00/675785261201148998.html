      <h1>Sainsbury's Christmas advert 2019 sees Dickensian fairy tale come to life</h1>
      <h2>The atmospheric and heartwarming Christmas ad tells the tale of the origins of St Nick (or Santa Claus) and is set in Victorian England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ruki Sayid, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ruki-sayid/</a></address>
      <p>A heartwarming Christmas ad from supermarket chain Sainsbury’s is set to fill the nation with a much needed feelgood factor.</p>
      <p>The two and a half minute “epic” brings together the store’s 150 years as a grocer and one of the oldest tales of them all - the origins of St Nick or Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>Set in Victorian England, the atmospheric mini-film centres on the first Sainsbury’s grocery store that was opened in Drury Lane, London in 1869 by James and Mary Ann Sainsbury.</p>
      <p>And it stars dirty faced chimney sweep Nicholas, played by nine-year-old London schoolboy Chris Dunkley, who is framed by his cruel boss - a Fagin style character.</p>
      <p>The workmaster steals a hatful of clementines from the store’s outdoor fruit stand and when orphan Nick picks up a fallen one from the ground to put it back, an over zealous police officer spots him and wrongfully has him carted off in a prison wagon.</p>

      <p>The Dickensian setting sees the hateful mob calling for Nick to be banished for stealing but Mrs Sainsbury has spotted the real culprit - his scheming master who is tucking into the fruit and declaring “some people are just rotten to the core”.</p>
      <p>As the boy is sent into snowy exile with no coat or blanket to shield him from the blizzard, Mrs Sainsbury - played by actress Bethan Cullinane - comes to his rescue.</p>
      <p>Nick pleads his innocence and she reassures him that she knows he wasn’t the thief and in a Christmas gesture of goodwill hands him a bag of clementines.</p>

      <p>She tells him: “If you can’t do something special for someone at Christmas, then when can you?”</p>
      <p>Unsure how to pay her back for her kindness, Nick has an idea - and in the dead of night heads to the children’s home where all his chimney sweep pals are asleep and pops a clementine into each of their empty Christmas stockings.</p>
      <p>And removing the naughty list from the wall, he crosses out all the kids names including his own and uses it to wrap a lump of coal for his callous boss adding the words “Naughty List YOU” - to the fury of the workmaster.</p>
      <p>As the excited kids race around with their gifts of the now traditional stocking filler fruit, the camera pans to Nick standing gazing at the town’s skyline from afar.</p>

      <p>Wrapped in the red blanket Mrs Sainsbury gave him, he unfolds his hat, puts it on and with a backward glance to the camera walks towards grazing reindeer, looking every inch like a young Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>The blockbuster ad ends with the narrator’s words: “And that is a totally true story” as Mrs Sainsbury winks at the camera.</p>
      <p>Filmed just outside Bucharest, Romania over five days, the atmospheric soundtrack was specially composed by Chris White of rock band The Zombies.</p>
      <p>The “Helping make Christmas, Christmas since 1869” ad will air during the Emmerdale break tonight (Tues) with the full version on YouTube from this morning.</p>

      <p>Laura Boothby, head of broadcast marketing at Sainsbury’s admitted the ad uses “artistic license” to re-imagine how a Christmas fairytale might have played out in 1869.</p>
      <p>She added: “This is the only year we can talk about being 150 years old and tell of the Christmas traditions we have today that came from Victorian England.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to tell a heartwarming story full of joy. There is an expectation on us every Christmas and we don’t want to disappoint.”</p>
      <p>And she revealed: “The more times you see the ad, the more little details you will spot.”</p>
      <p>10 things to look out for in the ad:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A poster for “plug boy” from last year’s ad on a lamp post.</li>
        <li>The jail master says “ho, ho, ho”.</li>
        <li>Nicholas falls asleep under a Christmas tree when he’s banished.</li>
        <li>The red blanket Mary Ann Sainsbury gives him becomes his red coat and snow on the collar looks like the white trim.</li>
        <li>Nick’s hat turns from brown to red at the end.</li>
        <li>One of the reindeer in the closing scenes has a red nose.</li>
        <li>The horse and cart that rescues Nick is marked “zero emissions”.</li>
        <li>The city scape at the end is a nod to the modern London skyline such as outlines of The Shard and London Eye.</li>
        <li>The Banishment Gate takes him to the North Pole.</li>
        <li>Nicholas is a chimney sweep meaning he can get up and down people’s chimneys easily like You Know Who.</li>
      </ol>
