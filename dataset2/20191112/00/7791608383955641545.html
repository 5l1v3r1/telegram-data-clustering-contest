      <h1>Artist Accuses Thinx Underwear Campaign Of Stealing Designs From Memes</h1>

      <p><b>Period underwear brand</b> Thinx posted images for their latest campaign last week, but a musician and artist named Bunny Michael has accused them of stealing their meme art. <br/><b>Bunny Michael</b> identifies as non-binary, uses they/them pronouns, and has compiled side-by-side images to alert Instagram about the alleged ripped-off images. <br/><b>In Thinx’s</b> campaign pictures, “doubles” of comedian Ilana Glazer are featured to advertise the brand’s Crimson line. For instance, there is one image where Glazer rests on the sofa while her body double and triple bring her tea and cakes in the brand’s red underwear. <br/><b>In another image,</b> she is seen hugging herself from behind, giving a feeling of being self-cared, according to <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/bunny-michael-thinx-memes-plagiarism/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>The Daily Dot</i></a>. <br/><b>Bunny Michael</b> has alleged that the images copy the concept of their “higher self” memes where double-exposure portraits are depicted to reflect how one relates to oneself. <br/><b>Since they</b> posted about the allegation, Michael received encouragement from their fans, who talked to Glazer about the situation. Glazer reposted their meme art, and has since apologized to the artist and reflected on the incident. <br/><b>While Michael</b> admitted that they are not the first artist to come up with such images, the rip-off was likely as Thinx approached them for a collaboration back in April. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The artist</b> told <i>The Daily Dot</i> that Thinx was fully aware of Michael’s body-double concept. <br/><b>According to</b> the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/bunnymichael/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">shared Instagram stories</a>, Thinx originally asked Michael to partner with them for a book project, even having a phone meeting where ideas were exchanged. However, they later announced the project was scraped and asked the artist to write a blog instead. <br/><b>Michael criticized</b> Thinx for its purportedly “shady” practice. While Thinx has responded to Michael’s accusations, the brand denied ripping off the artist’s ieas as three and four Glazers were featured instead of just two. In response, Michael said he felt “gaslighted.”</p>
