      <p>In just four days, it is crystal clear that <i>Bala</i> is not just a super hit but also a potential blockbuster in the making. With more than Rs 50 crore already in and an entry into the Rs 100 crore club all set to take place in a jiffy, <i>Bala</i> is yet another content-rich film coming from producer Dinesh Vijan, who has been churning out such cinema at a rapid pace right from the days of <i>Badlapur</i>.</p>
      <p>This can well be seen from the fact that over the years, <i>Badlapur</i> (2015), <i>Hindi Medium</i> (2017), <i>Stree</i> (2018) and now <i>Luka Chuppi</i> and <i>Bala</i> (2019) are rapid successes that have come from the house of Maddock Films. Moreover, each of these films has belonged to a different genre. <i>Badlapur</i> was a revenge drama, <i>Hindi Medium</i> was a slice-of-life comedy drama, <i>Stree</i> was a horror comedy, <i>Luka Chuppi</i> was a romantic comedy and now <i>Bala</i> is a slice-of-love comedy.</p>
      <p>Of course comedy is a running theme across majority of these aforementioned films (barring <i>Badlapur</i>), but the subjects are remarkably different and also truly offbeat. That’s something which Dinesh Vijan is revelling in, something which is ensuring that there is a surprise element in each of his outings.</p>

      <p>No wonder, there is huge anticipation around his 2019 line-up already. First to arrive would be <i>#AajKal</i> that has Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan coming together for Imtiaz Ali’s follow up to <i>Love Aaj Kal</i>. The film is a romantic musical drama. Then there is <i>Angrezi Medium</i>, a sequel to <i>Hindi Medium</i>, and this time around Kareena Kapoor Khan is joining Irrfan Khan in his adventures. It has to be seen what’s the kind of story being told for screen. Then of course there is <i>Roohi Afza</i> and with Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor pairing up for the first time ever, one keenly awaits the arrival of this horror comedy.</p>
      <p>With big power comes big responsibility and Dinesh Vijan is making sure that he is in for a long run. He has already delivered one major Rs 100 crore blockbuster in <i>Stree</i> and there is another coming soon in <i>Bala</i>. In fact, <i>Luka Chuppi</i> just missed the century mark by a whisker. Now all eyes are on <i>#AajKal</i> setting the tone for 2019 and turning out to be his biggest ever.</p>
      <p>However, instead of getting carried away, the production house is keeping the budget of all films under control. Smart economics invariable comes into play where cost of the making is in and around Rs 20 crore and then there is decent moolah reserves for P&amp;A.</p>
      <p>With good money coming from satellite, digital and music, almost all films coming from Maddock Films end up being safe on the table with theatrical business turning out to be an added bonus. This is what helped even <i>Made In China</i> and <i>Arjun Patiala</i> to an extent where despite low business theatrically, sales of others rights saved the day.</p>
      <p>No wonder, <i>Bala</i> is set to be a jackpot for all involved as it is not just about playing safe but huge profits that would be spoken about in weeks to come. While that should conclude 2019 on a more-than-satisfactory note for Dinesh Vijan and Maddock Films, there are already plans being put together to green light a series of films in 2019 which would be set for release in 2020.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
