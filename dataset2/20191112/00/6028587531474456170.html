      <p>Most auction houses are best known for selling the wines of upscale producers. Few have yet to put their personal mark on the world of international wine sales. However, the New York- and London-based <a href="https://www.sothebyswine.com/">Sotheby’s</a> has thrown its private-label collection into the ring.At the end of October, the auction house announced its debut of a primarily European collection of wines which sell from $16.95 for the <a href="https://winefolly.com/review/champagne-vs-prosecco/">Prosecco</a>, to $29.95 for a <a href="https://winefolly.com/tutorial/7-alternatives-to-top-champagne-brands/">Champagne</a>.

      <p>I had a recent chat with <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/about/team/jamie-ritchie">Jamie Ritchie,</a> the chairman of Sotheby’s Wine about the new wines’ rollout.</p>
      <p>All responses have been edited for length and clarity.</p>
      <p><b>Liza B. Zimmerman (LBZ):</b> Why did you decide to launch these wines?</p>
      <p>Jamie Ritchie (JR): Selecting wine can be intimidating for many people and so we have launched a range of Sotheby’s-branded wines that will assure the consumer that they are getting the best value from classic regions at affordable prices. We have both the expertise and relationships to ensure that each wine is of high quality, authentic to the region and good value for the money.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Where did you source them?</b>
      </p>
      <p>JR: The wines were sourced from producers whose wines we like and with whom we have great relationships.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: How did you choose which regions and grapes to feature?</b>
      </p>
      <p>JR: We wanted to launch our initial range with 12 wines, six red, three white, two sparkling and one rosé. Most of the initial 12 are the wines and appellations that have sold best in our New York retail business and we will continue to expand the range over time. </p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Do you plan to create more domestic labels?</b>
      </p>

      <p>JR: Yes, included in this initial collection we have a Sonoma Chardonnay and a Sonoma Pinot Noir and there are plans to add more domestic selections over time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Who is the demographic for them? Current auction customers or the general wine market?</b>
      </p>
      <p>JR: The general wine market – consumers who want to be reassured that they are getting great wines that offer good value for the money</p>
      <p>
        <b>LBZ: Are you planning to do wine club and other promotions with them? </b>
      </p>
      <p>JR: In due course, that is a logical next step </p>

      <p>JR: I think they are different and serve a different purpose. For instance, the producers that we have worked with are prominently disclosed on the front label as we are very proud of our relationships with them. So consumers know they are going to get something great inside the bottle.</p>
