      <p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on November 12 said that states have been requested to reject the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) and adopt electronic National Agriculture Market (eNAM) so that farmers get better price for their produce.</p>
      <p>The e-NAM has been pushed very much by the Union Government, and many states have agreed, also to take it up at their level, she said at an event organised by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) here.</p>
      <p>"Together with this we are also making sure that the states are cajoled to reject the APMC. It has served its purpose at one time there's no doubt. But today there are very many difficulties associated with the agricultural produce market committee, which at every state level has become not so efficient in helping the farmers find better price points for their produce," she said.</p>

      <p>"We are talking with states to sort of dismantle that and move towards e National Marketing for farmers," she added.</p>
      <p>Electronic National Agriculture Market (eNAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.</p>
      <p>So far 21 e-NAM mandis of eight States namely Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra &amp; Madhya Pradesh had joined hands to start inter –State trade on e-NAM.</p>
      <p>136 inter-State transactions  and 14 commodities which include vegetables, pulses, cereals, oilseeds, spices etc. have been traded under inter–state trade through e-NAM platform in a short span of time.</p>
      <p>Initially started with 25 commodities, e-trade facilities have been provided on 124 commodities with tradable parameters on e-NAM portal. Through inter State trade, farmers get better market access, more buyers/ traders &amp; realise better prices for their produce.</p>
      <p>The Finance Minister also said that she had in the Budget announced formation of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) to that farmers have easy access to institutional finance.</p>
      <p>FPOs are largely those cluster or groups of farmers who are being brought together so that credit and other assistance can be extended to them and their marketing issues are also addressed with a clear objective of making the produce earn the money that it should be, she added.</p>
      <p>Sitharaman said that the government is looking at acknowledging a more than proportionate dependence on rural life and agriculture and further emphasized the immediate need for taking up water management and water-related stress points.</p>
      <p>She emphasised that there is a need for the farmers contributing in solar energy generation, participation in wind energy, installing solar panels in his farms, etc and also to become an Urjadaata from Annadata.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the occasion, NABARD chairman said India provides USD 200 billion agriculture credit every year to small and marginal farmers.</p>
      <p>There will be a huge traction when the farmers will anchor the value chain, which in turn, will augment the value chain funding, he said, adding, these inclusive measures aided by technology interventions would bolster financial inclusion and rural financing efforts.</p>
      <p>Bhanwala also announced that NABARD’s largest SHG-Bank Linkage Programme benefiting millions of rural women will soon move to a digital platform, a move which will revolutionise the lending to women SHGs.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
