      <h1>NFL at 100: Eagles upset Patriots, give Philly a special win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">ROB MAADDI</a></address>
      <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Rookie running back Corey Clement took the snap out of shotgun formation, rolled to his left and pitched the ball to third-string tight end Trey Burton, who caught it coming off the end, ran a few steps and floated a pass to backup quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Nick Foles</a> in the end zone for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Facing the mighty <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">New England Patriots</a> on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s biggest stage, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a> coach Doug Pederson made a decision to try a trick play - the “Philly Special ” - on a fourth down late in the first half of Super Bowl 52 that will be remembered as one of the gutsiest calls in sports history.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it helped the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> upset the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> 41-33 on Feb. 4, 2018, to capture the franchise’s first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/super-bowl-title/">Super Bowl title</a> in one of the wildest games ever played.</p>
      <p>Pederson had already earned a reputation in just two seasons as head coach for being aggressive and he had a knack for going for it on fourth down. He knew he had to stay true to form to have a chance against Bill Belichick, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Tom Brady</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a>.</p>
      <p>“Everybody except the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Philadelphia Eagles</a> thought I finally came to my senses and was going to kick a field goal in that spot,” Pederson recalled. “It was the right moment, right time, perfect situation.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> were leading 15-12 and had the ball at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> 1 with 34 seconds remaining in the second quarter when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> walked over to Pederson during a timeout.</p>
      <p>“You want Philly, Philly?” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> asked.</p>
      <p>Pederson looked at his chart, took a second to collect his thoughts and replied: “Yeah, let’s do it.”</p>
      <p>The players executed it perfectly.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> faked calling audible and moved up to act like he was alerting the offensive linemen of a new play. Clement, who had four catches for 100 yards in the game, was in position to take the direct snap from center Jason Kelce. Burton, a quarterback in high school who hadn’t thrown a pass since his college days at Florida, took the pitch from Clement and softly threw it right to a wide-open <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> to give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a> a 22-12 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>One of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a>’s assistant coaches saw the Chicago Bears use the play a year earlier and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> worked on it for weeks. Pederson planned to use it in the playoffs but didn’t get a chance the first two games. It was supposed to be called on second or third down so the offense would get another chance to convert in case the pass fell incomplete. But Pederson couldn’t resist when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> suggested it.</p>
        <p>“Plays like that just don’t happen if you don’t work them in practice, but you’ve got to have belief first that they’re going to work,” Pederson said. “You’ve got to believe it’s going to work before it happens.”</p>
        <p>That signature moment between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> and Pederson standing on the sideline discussing the play was turned into a 9-foot, bronze statue that sits outside the team’s stadium as a reminder of the greatest play in franchise history. Generations of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> fans had waited 58 years to celebrate a championship.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> hadn’t won an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> title since 1960. They lost to Oakland in January 1981 and New England in February 2005 in their only two previous Super Bowl appearances. Meanwhile, Belichick and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> had won five championships since 2001 and were going for consecutive titles.</p>
        <p>Few gave Philly a chance after franchise quarterback Carson Wentz tore two knee ligaments in Week 14. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> stepped in and helped the team finish 13-3. But the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> were the first No. 1 seed to start the playoffs as an underdog. Players used that oddsmakers’ slight as motivation and wore dog masks throughout their playoff run. The defense stood out in a victory over the Falcons and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> was spectacular in a rout over the Vikings in the NFC championship game.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> were 4 1/2-point underdogs against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> in frigid Minnesota where the temperature was 2 degrees at kickoff, but it was beautiful inside the dome.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a> jumped ahead 9-3 when Alshon Jeffery made an excellent grab on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a>‘ 34-yard TD pass. LeGarrette Blount’s 21-yard TD run against his former team made it 15-3 midway through the second quarter. Then came Burton to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a>.</p>
        <p>Down 10 to start the second half, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> rallied. Everyone knew they would. A year earlier, they overcame a 28-3 deficit with 18 minutes left and beat the Falcons 34-38 in overtime to win their fifth Super Bowl.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a>’s 5-yard TD pass to Rob Gronkowski cut it to 22-19. After Clement caught a 22-yard TD pass in the back of the end zone to extend <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a>’s lead to 29-19, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> connected with Chris Hogan on a 26-yard TD pass to get New England within a field goal.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a>’s 4-yard TD pass to Gronkowski with 9:22 left in the game gave the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> their first lead, 33-32.</p>
        <p>But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a> answered after Pederson made another aggressive decision. He went for fourth-and-1 from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> 45 with 5:39 remaining and three timeouts in hand. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> found Zach Ertz for a 2-yard gain to keep the drive going. Then on third-and-7, Ertz made a juggling 11-yard TD catch for a 38-33 lead. The celebration had to wait for a video review, which upheld that Ertz had already established possession of the ball before he bobbled it on the ground.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> had a little over two minutes to force overtime, but Brandon Graham’s strip-sack was the defensive stop <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a> desperately needed. After a field goal increased the lead to 41-33, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> drove New England to midfield before his desperation heave at the end fell incomplete.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> were finally Super Bowl champions.</p>
        <p>Philly fans who flooded Minnesota throughout the week sang “Fly! <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a>! Fly!” as tears of joy streamed down their faces.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> set or tied 29 Super Bowl records in a thrilling contest. The teams combined for 1,151 yards, most in any game. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> didn’t punt. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> threw for 505 yards and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> racked up 631 total yards. The teams combined to miss four point-after conversions. New England’s 33 points were the most by a losing team.</p>
        <p>Here’s a look at how <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a>’s victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> 21 months ago affected each team the following season as the teams prepare for a rematch Sunday:</p>
        <p>NEW ENGLAND</p>
        <p>The dynasty didn’t end with the loss to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a>. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> took a different, tougher road to get there again, but they came out on top after the 2018 season.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> was clutch on the road in Kansas City in the AFC championship game and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> beat the Chiefs and the dynamic Patrick Mahomes 37-31 in overtime.</p>
        <p>The defense held the high-powered Los Angeles Rams to a field goal and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> captured their sixth <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/super-bowl-title/">Super Bowl title</a> with a 13-3 victory.</p>
        <p>And they are still going strong.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-england-patriots/">Patriots</a> (8-1) and their 42-year-old quarterback are heading toward another AFC East title. They have a one-game lead over Baltimore (7-2) for the top spot in the conference, so they can’t afford a letdown against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a>.</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">PHILADELPHIA</a>
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> fell short in their bid to win consecutive Super Bowl titles, losing 20-14 at New Orleans in the divisional round of the playoffs after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> led them to a wild-card win at Chicago helped by Cody Parkey’s “double doink” kick at the end.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> stepped in again after Wentz suffered a season-ending back injury and led the team to a 5-2 record, including playoffs. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> were 5-6 with Wentz, but there was no quarterback controversy.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nick-foles/">Foles</a> signed with Jacksonville in free agency and Wentz got a lucrative contract extension. This season, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> (5-4) have been plagued by injuries and inconsistency but have won two in a row and are battling Dallas (5-4) in the NFC East.</p>
        <p>HISTORY</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-eagles/">Eagles</a> lead the series 8-6, including a Super Bowl win for each team.</p>
        <p>MEMORABLE GAMES</p>
        <p>2005: Super Bowl 39 in Jacksonville, played on Feb. 6, 2005. Terrell Owens dominated the headlines, returning from ankle surgery against the medical staff’s advice. T.O. caught nine passes for 122 yards, but New England’s Deion Branch had 11 receptions for 133 yards, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in a 24-21 win. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tom-brady/">Brady</a> tossed a pair of TD passes. Donovan McNabb had three TD passes and three interceptions for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia/">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
