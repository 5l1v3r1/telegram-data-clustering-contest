      <h1>Judgement reserved in $6,5 million Makandiwa ‘false prophecy’ suit</h1>

      <p>THE Supreme Court has reserved a judgement in a case in which a Harare businessman is challenging a High Court ruling clearing United Family International Church (UFIC) leader Emmanuel Makandiwa and his wife, Ruth in a $6,5 million defamation suit he filed against the couple.</p>
      <p>Upenyu Mashangwa and his wife Blessing, both ex-UFIC members, claimed they lost a fortune after being misled by Makandiwa’s false prophecies.</p>
      <p>The couple raised six claims against the church leaders and alleged that Makandiwa in 2012 misrepresented that they would encounter a “debt cancellation miracle” and encouraged them to continue “seeding”.</p>
      <p>However, the Mashangwas’ house in Marlborough, Harare, according to the claim, was later attached and sold for $500 000 instead of $700 000 by ZB Bank.</p>
      <p>The couple has demanded nearly $7 million from the tycoon preacher.</p>
      <p>They wanted him to pay them $1,7 million for recommending a de-registered lawyer, Tichaona Mawere who was to dupe them, among other claims.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the High Court cleared Makandiwa of any wrongdoing and Mashangwa took the case to the Supreme Court arguing that a ruling by justice David Mangota was frivolous and vexacious.</p>
      <p>The case was heard Monday morning and Mashangwa’s lawyer, Advocate Sylvester Hashiti said Mangota passed a wrong judgement.</p>
      <p>“When I say a wrong judgement, I mean that it’s a judgement not supported by the law. It is wrong in that it attacks the procedure.</p>
      <p>“His judgement only dealt with the issue of vagueness and embarrassment,” said Hashiti.</p>
      <p>However, Makandiwa’s attorney, Advocate Lewis Uriri argued that Mashangwa’s arguments were baseless.</p>
      <p>“The application is groundless that no reasonable court will consider it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Uriri said Mashangwa did not place any evidence proving his case before the court.</p>
      <p>“They said they were sued but there is no evidence to prove this. They did not place before the court a version of their video. They simply refused to do so.</p>
      <p>“The bank (ZB) never sued them. The property they are talking about was sold, never attached for execution.</p>
      <p>“Ownership has not changed. The truth is the property was sold to one Jemina Gumbo and also to Walter Magaya and there are pending cases regarding this case,” he argued.</p>
      <p>Uriri further questioned why Mashangwa was failing to provide the court with writ of execution documents if the property was attached as claimed.</p>
      <p>“The whole case is riddled with falsehoods,” he said before the judgement was reserved.</p>
      <p>Justices Elizabeth Gwaunza, Lavender Makoni and Francis Bere heard the case.</p>
      <p>Before the High Court, Makandiwa successfully argued that the lawsuit was an abuse of the court process and that it should be thrown out.</p>
      <p>Regarding the debt cancellation claim, Makandiwa denied ever misleading the couple, saying no prophecy can command the congregants to stop repaying their debts.</p>
      <p>He said the leaders at UFIC only deliver sermons and teachings based on the word of God and video evidence of all services can confirm that.</p>
      <p>Makandiwa argued that the Mashangwas never owed ZB Bank as alleged and that the Marlborough property was never attached over a $500 000 debt as alleged.</p>
      <p>In February 2012, the property in question, was sold to someone for $800 000 and later on to a third party.</p>
      <p>Makandiwa denied ever prophesying that Mawere was a great lawyer who would never lose a case.</p>
      <p>He attached a digital video disc (DVD) showing the events of the day in question showing that the prophecy was targeting Mawere’s wife who had problems with her husband.</p>
      <p>Makandiwa stated in his papers that the couple never engaged Mawere as alleged.</p>
      <p>On the claim related to payment of tithes and offerings, Makandiwa said they are biblical, and no one is compelled to pay them.</p>
      <p>Makandiwa also denied knowledge of the $1,1 million that the Mashangwa claimed to have contributed to the church.</p>
      <p>It was also dismissed as false that the Mashangwas shut down Oceane Perfumes business after the church leader communicated that the products were cancerous. – Newzimbabwe</p>
