      <p>Sooraj Pancholi's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Satellite-Shankar'">'Satellite Shankar'</a> has hit the theatres on November 08. The film revolves around a young soldier played by Sooraj and his special journey connecting India. The actor left no stones unturned to promote the film on various platforms.</p>
      <p>And during a candid conversation with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes">Etimes</a>, the actor opened about a lot of things. Sooraj talked about his late ex-girlfriend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jiah-Khan">Jiah Khan</a>, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/MeToo">#MeToo</a> movement and more.</p>

        <b><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jiah-Khan">Sooraj Pancholi</a> on industry's support:</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, no, it's not that the industry has not supported me. I would have not got this film if the industry did not support me. Firstly, they would support me only on the merits of my talent, and nothing else. You know, of course, I've been through my personal difficulties where people were hesitant to come up to me for a film or we're not quite sure because of the false media accusations and unprofessional journalism I'd call it because my trial was an entire media trial, because if you go to the court, there's not much happening. And I can't do much about it because I'm the accused and I can only ask for it to start, you know. And I'm the only one who's asked for it to start in the history of anyone being an accused in India. I have got permission to start it but they still don't start it. So when a studio is asking me as to what's happening with my case, I have no answer because I'm stuck in this case and I just wanted to end for everybody you know, come what may the decision be of the court I'll respect that but at least start it because it's a lot of time that has passed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sooraj also opened up about Jiah Khan case:</b>
      </p>
      <p>You know, I've been giving interviews since yesterday. And this question is what the media wants to talk about, because this is what will track and let's be honest, talking about satellite Shanker and talking about a soldier will not be as tracking about me talking about my case. It was not a controversial case. Media made it into a controversial case.</p>
      <p>No one understands that it was her decision to do that (commit suicide), you know, it was her choice. It was her mental state to do that. And I think to blame someone for it is really unfair. Because today what if I do that to myself? Who will get blamed? I would blame the media for it because they have put a lot of pressure on me writing false things about me but you can't really blame things on other people. I think an individual has to be strong and more than a boyfriend support, they need family support and I don't know why the family was not there for her."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sooraj Pancholi on being the scapegoat for Jiah Khan suicide case"</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don't know why people don't see the 27 years of her life, I was 21. She was much older than me she was 27. Why don't people see the 27 years of her life and do some research on that? If they do, they will find so much that will shock them, which I know about. I can't, I don't want to say it. It's not that I can't say I don't want to say it because it's demeaning towards a person who's gone and, and my sympathies go out for her and her family. But what they have done, you know, to me is really unfair. You can't just hold one person responsible for this, you know, relationships have ups and downs, you have arguments you have, you know, fights over the phone, it's a normal thing today. People change partners like they change clothes, in fact, you know, so, I think I was just a scapegoat for this case.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sooraj on Jiah Khan's mother's involvement:</b>
      </p>
      <p>All the allegations made against me are not true. If they were true, the CBI would say that it's true. I've been through CBI and it's not easy. They go through big cases my case may be for them is very small. But I've sat through CBI at the age of 21. Day and night, day and night. They would have not left me if I've done something wrong today. You see, the people who are behind bars, they are huge, big successful people is because they have done wrong. And I don't think the CBI spares anybody. And the investigation is pretty hardcore, you know, and they found nothing against me. And her mother keeps blaming me and my family. But why does she not come to court? Why is that question never asked? Why do people ask me what is happening with the case? Why don't people ask her why she can't come to court? If she thinks that they're running this case on the wrong charge, the court can decide to change the charge, even in the middle of the trial. The court has the authority to do it. So why are you scared to stand in the witness box? Because me being accused, I can't really say anything because the accused is not allowed to speak in court. It's not up to me to prove myself innocent. It's up to them to prove me guilty and they cannot do it because they had no that they have nothing against me. But if you put a charge on somebody, it's your duty to come to court and stand in the witness box and talk. Why has she been avoiding that for seven years? She's wasted seven years of my life. Why don't people question that? It's because she has a British passport and she flies away back to her country whenever it's convenient to her and authorities can't do anything about that is very unfair. You know, if she wants the truth, and if she wants this case to happen, for her benefit, whatever, at least come to court and stand and be have the courage to stand in front of the judge and say what you have said in the media because it is all false.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sooraj on #MeToo movement:</b>
      </p>
      <p>That that is the sad truth. You know, if fingers pointed towards somebody, and something as big as me, two people will, of course, support the woman, you know, and if the woman is right, you should hang that person. Yes, you should do it. But what if the girl is not right, who's going to give back the respect that this person has lost, and there have been cases that person has not been found guilty, but no one says that out that this person is not guilty and this person has not committed the rape or molestation. That person also has a family, has a sister, mother, you know, sometimes relationships don't work out and then someone says that, oh, this person actually had raped me. That is so unfair because, you know, if it's proven, you must hang that person I would say, but if it's not then what happens to the person who accused this person of it, nothing happens to it, they let go free and that is why it's happening so much.</p>
