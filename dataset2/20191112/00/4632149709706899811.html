      <h1>Operation Kamala in Cubbon Park</h1>

      <p><i>Lotus Pond set for makeover in ‘couple of months’</i> <br/><br/>It’s yesterday once more. After several false starts, the horticulture department is once again set to restore the Lotus Pond to its former, pristine glory. <br/>The pond has had a chequered past. In 2010, former high court judge Michael F Saldanha had staged a dharna against the horticulture department’s neglect of the park which had resulted in birds disappearing and marine life vanishing from the lake. Justice Saldanha, along with a bunch of nature lovers, had been maintaining the lake and was devastated when the birds and animals he had been keeping there disappeared. <br/><br/>“This is a clear case of theft. Fourteen rabbits, 18 turkeys and more than 250 birds belonging to different species have been stolen from the pond. I had bought more than three dozen Giriraja poultry and they too have gone missing,” he had told Bangalore Mirror in 2010 after an overnight operation that destroyed the shelter for their shelter near the lake. “All of them probably ended up in Shivajinagara,” he recently told BM, adding that he had written to the horticulture department to revive the bird sanctuary around the pond.</p>

      <p>The last time lotus was seen in the pond was in 2016</p>
      <p>As if on cue, the department has now decided to rejuvenate the lake (for the cynic, yes, the same thing has been said several times – former CM SM Krishna had promised it and so did Umesh Katti when he was horticulture minister). But the deputy director of the horticulture department says things will be different this time around. <br/><br/>“The Lotus Pond will be rejuvenated in a couple of months. The horticulture department will work to develop it. Cubbon Park will also be developed with improved footpaths and planting more medicinal plants,” said G Kusuma.</p>

      <p>This turtle had been removed from the water while it was being desilted in 2010 and workers ‘forgot’ to return it to its habitat</p>
      <p>The pond is situated opposite Bal Bhawan. In April 2015, over 700 fish were found floating in the lake when biological oxygen demand (which goes up due to pollution or overpopulation of marine life) shot up. Clean-up operations were undertaken after that incident but till date the pond lies in a state of neglect. A similar clean-up operation was carried out in April 2010. “A 50-year-old turtle, Drona, was taken out of the pond while cleaning up the water body and the horticulture department forgot to put it back. I took it to a veterinary hospital but it couldn’t survive,” Justice Saldanha said.</p>

      <p>“The Lotus Pond used to be the centre of attraction at Cubbon Park. Now the pond has to be rejuvenated so that the park’s beauty is enhanced and more colour is added. Also, the horticulture department should take care of the pollution levels so that it doesn’t impact nature. I have also written a letter to the deputy director of the horticulture department asking him to build a bird sanctuary at Cubbon Park soon,” Justice Saldhana added. <br/><br/>If the horticulture department stays true to its promise, lotus will definitely bloom in Cubbon Park – although the jury is still out whether it will do so in Karnataka after the bypolls.</p>
