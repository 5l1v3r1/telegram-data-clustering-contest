      <p>Tulsa is seeking digital nomads to put their roots down here.The Oklahoma city is the focal point of <a href="https://tulsaremote.com/">Tulsa Remote</a>, a program offering a $10,000 grant and additional incentives to selected participants to move and work remotely from Tulsa for a year. Following its launch in 2018, Tulsa Remote will go from having chosen 100 people last year to doubling that amount for its 2020 process. The goal is to reach at least 250.</p>
      <p>“Our mission has always been to attract talented and diverse individuals from across the country to Tulsa and get them connected to the existing community,” said Tulsa Remote Executive Director Aaron Bolzle.</p>
      <p>When selected applicants arrive in Tulsa, they get a warm welcome. And they’re encouraged to get to know the people in their neighborhood and become involved within their communities. Tulsa Remote introduces these newcomers to others by partnering with local organizations to host regular events and meetups to help these newcomers get better acquainted.</p>
      <p>“Much of what our program does is remove the barriers that cause difficulties in individuals settling into a new city quickly,” said Bolzle.</p>

      <p>Funded by George Kaiser Family Foundation, Tulsa Remote has basic requirements.</p>
      <p>In order to be eligible, applicants currently must reside outside of Oklahoma, be 18 years of age or older and can work and live in the United States. They also have to relocate to Tulsa within a year of being accepted into the program, plus commit to living in Tulsa for at least that same amount of time. Additionally, they must be working remotely full-time or self-employed.</p>
      <p>Besides receiving much press coverage during its 2018 launch, Bolzle said Tulsa Remote has provided a significant return on investment for Tulsa. The initiative resulted in getting than 10,000 applications from over 150 countries.</p>
      <p>“We are still documenting and gathering data for all the ways the program has helped our community,” said Bolzle. “As long as the program continues to have a positive impact on the community, we will continue it.”</p>

      <p>The application process for the 2020 program is now under way. “There is no deadline at this point, but we might close the application at any time, so people should apply now,” said Bolzle.</p>
      <p>Along with the introduction of Tulsa Remote, 2018 has ushered in other community-related initiatives in Tulsa. That November, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/1883689781881612/mother-road-market/">Mother Road Market</a> opened as the city’s first food hall with over 20 food and retail concepts plus a commercial kitchen space. Last September, <a href="https://www.gatheringplace.org/">A Gathering Place </a>came into fruition as an inclusive riverfront park with a children’s adventure playground, a skate park, restaurants and gathering spots.</p>
