      <h1>Take Control of Your Gut Health With the Most Advanced Microbiome Test Money Can Buy</h1>
      <h2>Viome's Gut Intelligence Test uses the latest technology to map your microbiome.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://futurism.com/authors/futurismcreative" target="_blank">Futurism Creative</a></address>
      <p>These days almost everybody has heard about <a href="https://futurism.com/sponsored-gut-health-crisis">the importance of gut health</a>. But very few people actually know what to do about it. Just about everything you read online or see on television talks about eating specific gut healthy foods. However, the truth of the matter is, if you really want to improve gut health, you have to start by taking a microbiome test <a href="https://www.viome.com/?refcode=Futurism20">like the Gut Intelligence Test by Viome</a>.</p>
      <p>When we talk about the gut, what we’re really talking about is the community of symbiotic bacteria and other microorganisms that live in the human digestive tract. Over the last few decades, scientists have discovered that this ecosystem plays a <i>huge</i> role in our overall health, affecting almost every system in the body, including the digestive system, immune system, and cardiovascular system. Some studies have even linked gut health to a number of specific diseases and conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, and colon cancer. However, because everyone’s gut microbiome is different, there is no single course of action doctors and scientists can prescribe to improve gut health. That’s where microbiome tests come in.</p>
      <p>A microbiome test is kind of like a DNA test. Instead of mapping out your genes and identifying markers for certain diseases and conditions, a microbiome test maps out the microorganisms that live in your gut and identifies how they affect your health.</p>
      <p>Trying to improve gut health without taking a microbiome test is like playing darts while blindfolded. You have a general idea of where the dart board is, so you’ll probably hit the board a couple of times. If you’re really lucky, you might even get a bullseye. However, you’d do a lot better with your eyes open.</p>
      <p>The same can be said for building a healthy gut. Everybody knows there are certains foods that are supposed to improve gut health. But you won’t know for sure what’s best for <i>your</i> gut until you take the blindfold off and take a microbiome test.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.viome.com/?refcode=Futurism20">The Gut Intelligence Test by Viome </a>uses something called “advanced metatranscriptomic sequencing technology,” originally developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for national security purposes, to identify and quantify the strains and species of microorganisms in your gut <i>and</i> determine what nutrients and toxins they are producing. Viome then runs this data through a proprietary AI algorithm called Vie, which uses a massive database of information to come up with personalized nutrition recommendations designed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>increase microorganism species associated with overall wellness</li>
        <li>minimize microorganism species associated with poor health</li>
        <li>create the ideal ratio of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats for your diet</li>
        <li>encourage foods that are most compatible with your metabolism</li>
        <li>help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight</li>
        <li>increase your energy, focus and well-being.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once you order your Gut Intelligence Test, <a href="https://www.viome.com/?refcode=Futurism20">Viome will send you an easy to use, non-invasive at-home kit</a> to collect your sample. Then you simply return your sample using the postage-paid box provided, and Viome will process it and send you the results.</p>
      <p>Some of the latest microbiome research has uncovered links between gut health and some of the health and wellness issues many of us struggle with every single day, such as weight management, sleep, and mental clarity, among other things. <a href="https://www.viome.com/?refcode=Futurism20">Viome’s gut intelligence test</a> could provide the key to managing these issues.</p>
      <h4>Weight Loss</h4>
      <p>If you struggle to lose weight despite exercising and eating well, you probably just assumed your struggles must be genetic. However, it now turns out that your problems could be due to an imbalanced gut. Today, scientists can actually analyze the composition of your gut microbiome and tell with 90 percent accuracy whether or not you are obese. They have also identified specific gut microbes that play a role in keeping obesity at bay. If you have been struggling to lose weight, Viome’s Gut Intelligence test can help you create a diet that feeds these obesity-busting microbes.</p>
      <h4>Sleep</h4>
      <p>There are a lot of factors that keep us from getting good sleep, including stress, anxiety, diet, and lack of exercise. For some people, however, gut imbalance could be the culprit. There are several strains of bacteria in your gut that play key roles in the production of melatonin, which is the hormone that regulates your sleep-wake cycle. Viome can help you provide nourishment for these bacteria, thereby boosting melatonin production and improving your body’s endogenous sleep regulatory system.</p>
      <h4>Mental Clarity</h4>
      <p>Did you know that your diet can cloud your thinking? It turns out the microorganisms in our digestive tract play a major role in producing neurotransmitters, hormones, proteins, and other compounds necessary for sending signals to and from the brain. That means your gut can actually affect how you feel and think. Fortunately, Viome can help you figure out if there are any dietary changes that might improve your brain function.</p>
