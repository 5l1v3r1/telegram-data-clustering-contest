      <p>Athens - China and Greece agreed to push ahead with a <b>600 million euros</b> investment by COSCO Shipping into Greece’s largest port, Piraeus, as part of efforts to boost its role as a hub in rapidly growing trade between Asia and Europe.</p>
      <p>The agreement, part of <b>16 trade deals </b>signed between Greece and China, came during an official visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Athens on Monday. The two countries have drawn closer since 2009 when COSCO won a 35-year concession to upgrade and run container cargo piers in Piraeus (OLPr.AT).</p>
      <p>COSCO Shipping [601919.SS] bought a majority <b>51% stake in Piraeus </b>port in 2016. COSCO plans to turn Piraeus port into the biggest commercial harbor in Europe, spending about 600 million euros ($660 million) to boost operations, including mandatory investments of 300 million euros by 2022 which once concluded will allow it to acquire an additional 16% stake in the port. But opposition from local communities prompted Greece to reject COSCO’s proposals for a new container terminal in Piraeus last month, saying that conditions “were not ripe” yet.</p>
      <p>Xi met Greek Prime Minister <b>Kyriakos Mitsotakis </b>on Monday and the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding, stating their mutual will to overcome any obstacles in the implementation of COSCO’s investment in Piraeus, a Greek government official said.</p>
