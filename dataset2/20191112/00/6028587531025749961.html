      <p>If you were on Yahoo Finance early on Monday morning, you might have caught a certain headline of note. It read that “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-have-canceled-the-2020-recession-111918255.html">Stocks Have Cancelled the 2020 Recession…</a>”Admittedly, that wasn’t the main featured article, at least at the time I saw it. But it was still up there: one of the five possible posts for browsers to pick from underneath a Yahoo Finance LIVE piece. Which, incidentally, was scrolling with news that McDonalds had fired its CEO for an inappropriate personal liaison within the company.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the fast-food chain takes its company policies concerning such things very seriously.</p>
      <p>That’s good to know for any McDonalds’ investors. Yet much more intriguing (at least to me) was that aforementioned article. That and the one that led with the headline: “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-november-4-2019-133059483.html">Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Trade at All-Time Highs</a>.”</p>
      <p>Opening up that particular piece, we find <b>BlackRock</b> (BLK) Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income Rick Rieder saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“We think [the October jobs report], along with other recent reports on consumption, on housing, and on retailing are emblematic of an economy in which the consumer remains strong, with strong levels of income, job opportunity, net worth, and further displays historically low levels of leverage…<br/>“And while some of those positive factors may adjust somewhat lower from here; taken together, they are also in great contrast to those characteristics that previously preceded deep economic slowdowns.”</blockquote>
      <p>There’s clearly a lot to be enthusiastic about with the stock market in general these days. That’s not a premise I’m going to come against any time soon.</p>
      <p>With that said, that doesn’t mean there’s not a negative side to consider. There always is.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paradise Aside…</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was only last month – in fact, last week – that I published “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradthomas/2019/10/31/just-another-day-in-reit-paradise/">Just Another Day in REIT Paradise</a>” here on <i>Forbes</i>.</p>
      <p>That title was based on the greeting I got from my business partner every single workday back when I was a real estate developer. It didn’t matter whether it was sunny or stormy, hot or cold outside. He’d say it was “just another day in paradise” as faithfully as a diehard Jimmy Buffett fan should be.</p>
      <p>I didn’t always get it at the time. But these past 10 months of 2019 have reminded me very much of that life slogan of his. Because the real estate investment trust, or REIT, sector that I follow so closely? Well, it’s been on fire in almost all the best ways possible.</p>
      <p>As I wrote on October 31, “Using VNQ as a benchmark, real estate investment trusts… [have] returned more than 26%” as of late September. Or, put another way, “REITs have hit the ball out of the park this year, even outperforming the S&amp;P 500.”</p>
      <p>We’ve made some great gains in some great companies as a result. As such, I’m not going to lie… I’m exceptionally proud of the portfolios my <i>Forbes Real Estate Investor </i>is actively holding onto. We’ve made gains of 21%, 39%, and even 53% for our subscribers!</p>
      <p>For an overall slow but steady sector like real estate investment trusts, I’m not going to object to upswings like that. I don’t think anyone could. However, as I keep saying, don’t throw yourself headfirst into REITs.</p>
      <p>This isn’t Scrooge McDuck’s money silo we’re talking about. No matter how good an investment or group of investments is doing, there’s always risk involved.</p>
      <p>And woe to the investor who forgets that truth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No Excuses Allowed</b>
      </p>
      <p>Considering how I’ve learned the hard way a time or two in my past… I’m extremely determined to minimize that risk in the future. And not just for me: for you too. I genuinely don’t want any of my readers to lose money any more than I want to lose it myself.</p>
      <p>Quite the opposite.</p>
      <p>That’s why I’m writing today about the worst performing REITs we’ve seen so far in 2019. There are actually whole entire REIT segments that are struggling – though that doesn’t mean there aren’t some gems among them.</p>
      <p>The five below, however, aren’t in that category. Unless their particular situations change drastically, you’ll want to avoid them altogether for the time being.</p>
      <p>Maybe even longer than that.</p>
      <p>Now, as we said, some of the companies below are caught up in some significantly unfortunate situations. So one might want to argue that it’s not their fault and that they’ll be able to recover just as soon as their sectors stabilize.</p>
      <p>To be sure, I don’t expect constant sunshine and rainbows for the REITs I recommend. What I do look for, however, is the ability to withstand any storms that come along.</p>
      <p>The stock price might drop in such situations, but the fundamentals remain strong. And since that just isn’t the case when it comes to our list below…</p>
      <p>Well, that’s why they made the list below in the first place.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3 Beaten Down REITs</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Uniti Group</b> (UNIT) shares declined by 50% year-to-date and we consider this REIT to be highly speculative based upon the high degree of uncertainty surrounding whether or not management will be able to raise sufficiently low-cost capital to grow its revenues and cash flow.</p>
      <p>Like most “cigar butt” picks, Uniti is friggin dirt cheap today, trading at $6.05 with a P/AFFO multiple of 2.82x. The primary risk with this stock has to do with the uncertainty related to its top tenant, Windstream (WIN).</p>
      <p>Investors must measure the risk to understand that probabilities related to the legal issues (Chapter 11 reorg) and monthly rent payments to Uniti.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, Uniti owns sufficient critical mission assets, and there could be aple rewards for the brave investor. This is the chance of a lifetime with a very high probability of doubling your money in just a few weeks and tripling your money in less than five months ending mid-April 2020 (and probably just three months ending mid-February 2020).</p>
      <p><b>Macerich </b>(MAC) shares fell by 54% year-to-date and while we consider the companies high-quality mall portfolio attractive, we aren’t ready to jump in quite yet. The crux of our bearish sentiment has to do with the company’s dangerous payout ratio of nearly 100%.</p>
      <p>In a few days, JC Penney will report earnings and we believe there’s a very good chance that the struggling department store chain could report more store closures.</p>
      <p>J.C. Penney said in early 2019 that it only planned to close 18 department store locations and nine of its home and furniture stores this year. At the time, that guidance seemed weak. The company still has more than 800 stores up and running - more than Macy’s and Nordstrom. More closures are inevitable - it’s more a matter of timing.</p>
      <p>We think more closures could be coming sooner rather than later as J.C. Penney clearly has a turnaround plan in place, based on recent reports. And right-sizing its portfolio could be a good strategy for the longer-term health of the business.</p>
      <p>Also, Macerich is a landlord to another struggling chain, Forever 21. While the apparel company tries to find its footing (recently filed BK), we consider the chances of a Macerich dividend cut elevated. And even though shares remain cheaply valued – yielding 10.81% with a P/FFO of 7.74x - we don’t see a dividend cut priced in at this time.</p>
      <p><b>Tanger Outlets</b> (SKT) shares fell by 37% year-to-date and we maintain a Strong Buy.  While traditional mall landlords continue to navigate department store closures, Tanger doesn’t have to worry about re-leasing bog box space because the company has zero department stores in its portfolio.</p>
      <p>It’s true that outlets aren’t immune to store closures, but this far, Tanger has done an excellent job maintaining occupancy (has been at 95% or higher in over 25 years) and growing its dividend (for 26 years in a row).</p>
      <p>Also, outlets aren’t overbuilt like malls, and we believe that as more department stores close, Tanger is better positioned to sign new leases, given the reduced supply. Tanger also has one of the safest payout ratios in the mall REIT sector, as the company generates around $100 million of free cash flow after its dividend.</p>
      <p>Shares are trading at $15.86 with a dividend yield of 8.95%.</p>
