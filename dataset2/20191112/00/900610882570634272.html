      <p>Emirates has opened its first remote check-in terminal in Dubai for cruise passengers. Set up at Port Rashid, these new check-in counters will allow passengers, disembarking from cruise ships to check-in for their onward Emirates flight at the same facility.</p>
      <p>The service at Port Rashid will have eight counters. The Emirates’ staff will check-in the customer’s luggage and issue boarding pass up to four hours before flight departure.</p>
      <p>This remote check-in option will be open during the sailing period from October to April. In the coming sixth months, 198 cruise ships are expected to dock at Port Rashid where approximately 280,000 passengers will have onward Emirates flights.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Mattar, divisional senior vice president, Emirates Airport Services said, “We are committed to provide a seamless and hassle-free travel journey for our customers. With the increasing popularity of Dubai as a cruise tourism destination, we have ensured that every touch point in our customer journey for this important traveller segment is thoughtfully served.</p>
      <p>“Our first remote check-in facility at Port Rashid will allow cruise passengers with onward flights the freedom to explore Dubai during their short transit having dropped their luggage and completed check-in formalities.”</p>
      <p>This new service adds to <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2018/04/26/emirates-adds-home-check-option/">Emirates’ home check-in solution introduced last year</a> that enables customers departing Dubai to check-in from anywhere in the emirate.</p>
