      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah">Utah</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/death-row-inmate-with-rare-condition">death row</a> inmate who wanted to be executed by firing squad following his conviction for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">murdering</a> his sister-in-law and her young daughter over his strong polygamist beliefs has died of natural causes in prison, corrections officials said Monday.</p>
      <p>Ron Lafferty died at a state prison in Draper, a suburb of Salt Lake City, a Utah Department of Corrections spokeswoman said. The 78-year-old was sentenced to death in 1985 for the killing of his brother's wife and her young child because of her resistance to polygamy.</p>
      <p>The murders were the basis for Jon Krakauer's 2003 book "Under the Banner of Heaven" A Story of Violent Faith."</p>

      <p>Lafferty claimed he killed the two because of a revelation from God. His brother, Dan, 71, received a life sentence for his involvement in the slayings.</p>
      <p>On July 24, 1984, Brenda Lafferty was beaten and strangled with a vacuum cleaner cord in her apartment in Fork. She and her 15-month-old daughter, Erica, had their throats slashed.</p>
      <p>Allen Lafferty discovered his wife in a pool of blood and their daughter near her crib.</p>
      <p>Ron and Dan Lafferty believed their sister-in-law's refusal to join the School of Prophets interfered with a "divine," plan that required the participation of all six Lafferty brothers, <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/11/utah-death-row-inmate-ron/">The Salt Lake Tribune</a> reported.</p>
      <p>A jury found Ron Lafferty guilty and sentenced him to death. He was retried and again sentenced to death in 1996 after a federal appeals court overturned the conviction because a judge used an incorrect standard to determine he was fit to stand trial.</p>

      <p>At the time, Utah's death row inmates were allowed to choose their preferred method of execution. Lafferty chose a firing squad. The state later changed the law to use firing squads only as a backup to lethal injections.</p>
      <p><a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/4244886/ronnie-lee-gardner-executed-by-firing-squad/#sp=show-clips">Ronnie Lee Gardner</a> was the last inmate to die in the U.S. by firing squad, back in 2010. Utah authorities executed him after he was convicted of killing an attorney during a failed courthouse escape.</p>
      <p>The state attorney general predicted Lafferty would have been executed in 2020.</p>
