      <p>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - Katy Perry will perform before and after the Women’s Twenty20 World Cup cricket final on International Women’s Day as organizers bid to set a world record for attendance.</p>
      <p>Perry will perform March 8 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in what is tipped to be the biggest women’s cricket match ever.</p>
      <p>The tournament starts Feb. 21 in Sydney with defending champion Australia against India and will conclude under lights at the historic MCG</p>
      <p>The International Cricket Council says local organizers are aiming to break the world record of 90,185 for a crowd at a women’s sports event, set during the 1999 FIFA World Cup final at Pasadena, Calif.</p>
      <p>“The final … presents a ground breaking opportunity to set a world record for attendance at a women’s sporting fixture on the day when equality and women’s achievements are celebrated globally,” the ICC said in a statement Wednesday.</p>

      <p>Perry, who is India this week, said in a statement: “I’m all about celebrating equality and the achievements of women, which naturally happens on a global scale on International Women’s Day. It’s no coincidence that I said yes to performing live at the women’s final on this day.”</p>
