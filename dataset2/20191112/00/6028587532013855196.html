      <p>Almost a year after the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-s-luckie/facebook-is-failing-its-black-employees-and-its-black-users/1931075116975013/">publishing</a> of a memo from a former Facebook manager about the company’s toxic work culture, Facebook is still being accused of having a “Black people problem.” Last Thursday, a <a href="https://medium.com/@blindfb2020">Medium page</a> by the name of Facebook Blind published an article claiming that leaders at Facebook are doing little to stop the racism that permeates their workplace. The article is comprised of twelve different anonymous accounts of racism and discrimination experienced at the company. What was last year dubbed as a “Black people problem” that impacted Black employees at Facebook is apparently more widespread and is impacting the company’s Latinx and Asian employees, the article claims. What’s disturbing about the incidents accounted in the article is that allegedly they were well-documented and had witnesses to corroborate their accuracy. One important point to note is that many of the incidents shared in the article represent micro-aggressions that may not have been taken seriously because by their nature they seem more benign on the surface, especially to the majority populations. The 2019 <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/inclusion-insights.html">State of Inclusion</a> survey by Deloitte found that the vast majority of bias that is witnessed or experienced in the workplace today is more subtle and covert versus the more blatant discrimination that was seen in the past. It seems the more elusive the discrimination becomes, the more difficult it is to eradicate.  </p>
      <p>Another point that deserves analysis is why with increase in diversity focus, the lack of effective action tends to follow. The article highlighted a critical issue that many companies face where their diversity, equity and inclusion promises do not materialize for their employees. Companies make diversity commitments and pledges and yet so many diversity programs continue to fail, <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail">research</a> finds. The lip service that organizations pay to their employees has led to an overall <a href="https://medium.com/smells-like-team-spirit/the-diversity-fatigue-is-real-atlassians-state-of-diversity-report-2018-2655d7eb5e2c">diversity fatigue</a>. Employees are tired of hearing empty words. It is not enough to have images of diverse employees on your websites and advertisements if the demographic makeup of your company does not reflect what is being projected. In order for lasting changes to be made, companies like Facebook must take an honest assessment of the company culture to figure out how to properly diagnose the problems and start working towards effective solutions. But where do they start? Leadership and human resource departments must first understand <i>what</i> micro-aggressive behaviors are and then a protocol must be set up to address these more subtle and covert forms of discrimination. Diversity trainings should include discussions of this more common type of bias.</p>
      <p>Leadership plays a critical role in preventing discriminatory behaviors from being perpetuated in the workplace. One of the most effective ways to eliminate micro-aggressions may be a management style called <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/management-by-walking-around">Management by Walking Around</a> (MBWA). MBWA builds on the premise of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/broken-windows-theory">Broken Windows theory</a>; if managers and supervisors are more accessible to employees, micro-aggressive behaviors may be more easily detected, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/31568523/Tackling_Micro-Aggressions_in_Organizations_A_Broken_Windows_Approach">researchers</a> posit. Companies that are serious about wanting to create a more inclusive and equitable environment must nip micro-aggressions in the bud before they manifest into larger problems that are more challenging to exterminate. Employees that are victims of micro-aggressions, particularly micro-aggressions that are frequent and habitual, may be prone to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/28/what-microaggressions-small-slights-serious-consequences/362754002/">negative health outcomes</a>, which could impact productivity. Victims of micro-aggressions may decide to work while wounded. In addition, the toxic environment could lead to a revolving door of employees, which also negatively impacts <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25146163?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">employee performance</a> and can then impact a company’s <a href="https://blog.hrps.org/blogpost/Increase-Profits-by-Reducing-Turnover-and-Churnover">bottom line</a>.</p>
      <p>Continuing to overlook and ignore employee complaints and concerns regarding the work culture will only create more complications for an organization. Small problems that don’t get addressed compound and turn into bigger and often more costly issues. Companies that are serious about fostering a culture of inclusion must prioritize communication and should take employee feedback very seriously. Diversity promises should not be made without concrete actions that follow. Inclusion starts at the top and trickles down. Failure to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive company will <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/">stifle innovation, creativity</a> and will hinder a business’s competitive advantage. Organizations must realize it is no longer a matter of doing what’s right—it’s simply a matter of a survival.</p>
