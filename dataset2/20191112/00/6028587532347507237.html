      <h1>Small Cars, Big Dreams: ‘57 Nash Metropolitan Wins Hot Wheels Legends Tour to Become Next Die-cast Collectible</h1>

      <p>If you were ever into cars even a little bit, chances are you had a few Hot Wheels toy cars as a child. Everyone loves them: they're cute, collectible, inexpensive, and fun to drive around on the living room carpet. If you were anything like me as a child, then you had about 200 pristine 1:64 scale cars ready to show off to your parents during the weekly living room car show. I attribute much of my present love for cars to my formative childhood as a Hot Wheels and Matchbox test ‘driver’ and collector. </p>

      <p> You may not believe it, but I played with these model cars so much that I wore out the knees in every<i> </i>pair of pants I owned growing up, as I spent the majority of my free time running around the rug on my knees with my cars. But as I grew up, that time faded away into memory, the cars stayed in the box more often and my pants no longer needed patches.  That’s one of the sad parts about growing up, our imagination isn't as strong as it once was, and we're too busy with meaningless tasks and so forget how to enjoy simple times. </p>

      <p>However, best friends Greg Salzillo and Dave Ford decided not to let the daily grind stop them from being creative and imaginative. They took about $10,000, four months, and a lot of TLC into making an old ’57 Nash Metropolitan a child's dream car. It features custom headers coming out of the fenders, old school stock steel wheels, original bias-ply tires, and a 300hp small-block engine.  </p>

      <p>But for Greg and Dave, building the real-life car is about more than just creating a slick ride for themselves. It is about hard work, passion, and creation, as they hope to show kids and young adults that they-too can work hard and create something. Life doesn't have to be behind a desk, you don't need to live the 40,40,40 life (work 40-hours a week at a job you don't like for 40 years and retire on 40% of what you made).  Their goal is to be an example against being afraid to break the mold and try something different, to follow your passions, work hard, and take a shot at doing what you love. </p>

      <p>Greg and Dave’s build was chosen from among almost 5,000 custom cars entered in the Hot Wheels Legends Tour to be turned into a 1:64 model car to be sold by the Hot Wheels brand.  The tour visited 20 cities throughout Europe and North America. Ted Wu, VP and Global Head of Design for Vehicles for Mattel said “We chose ‘The Nash’ as it represents the true garage spirit by bringing generations together and creating an impressive car that’s built, not bought. You see it and instantly know it’s meant to be Hot Wheels with that color, the shape and the dice.”When asked about it, Greg Salzillo added:“We’re extremely overwhelmed, proud and excited over what Dave and I created with The Nash… I can’t wait to see my kids’ faces when they see their dad’s car turned into a real Hot Wheels toy!” </p>

        <b>Final Thoughts</b>
      </p>
      <p>The '57 Nash Metropolitan will make an incredible Hot Wheels.  It has amazing coloration and embodies the fun and creative spirit that Hot Wheels is all about. What's even more incredible is that Greg and Dave were able to make this amazing car for less than $10,000 in their spare time.  It just goes to show that you can do big things if you dare to dream.</p>
