      <p>(Reuters) - Brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev NV will buy the rest of Craft Brew Alliance that it does not own in a deal valuing the Portland-based brewing company at about $321 million, the two companies said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Shares of Craft Brew Alliance soared 122.6% to $16.32 after the bell, hovering near the offer price of $16.50 in cash.</p>
      <p>The deal is a reversal in stance by the world’s largest brewer, which owns 31.2% stake in Craft Brew and had said in August it would not buy out the company.</p>
      <p>Global brewers are facing several challenges in large developing markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa even as people consume less beer in Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p>Craft Brew’s portfolio of regional breweries and lifestyle brands is an addition to Anheuser-Busch and will help fuel the growth of craft beer category in the competitive beer industry in the United States, Anheuser-Busch said.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to close in 2020, Craft Brew said.</p>
