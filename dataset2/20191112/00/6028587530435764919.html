      <h1>In Bodega Bay, Dungeness Crab Is King And The Season Starts Soon</h1>

      <p>Crab pots are stacked high around the harbor of this scenic town west of San Francisco in anticipation of the start of commercial season on Nov. 22, a slight delay from the original opener. We recently visited and found a few classic dishes that make it a worthy year-round destination for fans of this sweet seasonal crustacean.</p>

      <h3>Navigating some choppy waters</h3>
      <p>Fishing commercially for Dungeness crab hasn’t been easy in recent years, as the department of fish and wildlife shut down the season early last year over concern that whales and turtles may get caught in the gear. That issue is at the heart of the delay in opening this year’s season.</p>
      <p>However, the charter fishing business is going strong, said Captain Rick Powers, who takes groups out regularly through his <a href="http://www.bodegabaysportfishing.com/">Bodega Bay Sport Fishing Center</a>. “Everybody has been catching their limit of 10 crabs, and we’ve also been pulling in some ling cod and rockfish,” he said.</p>
      <p>Year-round, the seafood-centric restaurants around the town Alfred Hitchcock used as a backdrop for “The Birds” feature dishes shining the spotlight on Dungeness crab. Here are a few essential places to try.</p>

      <p>No matter what time of year, crab is the star of the show at the popular spot on Spud Point. The couple who launched this humble cafe in 2004, Tony and Carol Anello, vowed to make the place like the spots on Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco they remember growing up. Tony had been a commercial fisherman for years, and that experience helped him to connect with local fisherman he sources from for the restaurant. Those hard-working folks are featured on the<a href="https://www.spudpointcrabco.com/about-tony-anello/"> restaurant’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to serving an amazing crab sandwich – lightly dressed crab on a warm, soft hoagie roll, perfect in its simplicity – there’s also a crab cocktail on the menu, crab cakes and whole steamed crab. Carol’s clam chowder is a best seller, and rightly so, especially the peppery Manhattan-style.</p>
      <p><b>Insider tip:</b> While the place is packed at lunch, it opens at 9 a.m., so come early and you’ll have your choice of an outdoor picnic table with a harbor view.</p>

      <p>This elegant dining room has been home to guests gushing over its signature crab cake for decades, the ultra-rich presentation brightened by citrus, shaved fennel and tarragon aioli. On the main course side of the menu, executive chef Brendalee Vialpando and her team turn out an exceptional risotto. It’s distinguished by the generous addition of artichoke hearts, mascarpone and Dungeness crab.</p>
      <p>“We are very lucky to be located where we are and to be able to change the menu with the seasons,” the chef said.</p>
      <p><b>Insider tip:</b> Arrive early and have a pre-meal cocktail in the Fireside Lounge, where you can grab a chair inside, or, if the weather’s nice, sit outside by the fire pits.</p>

      <p>Owners Shane and Dana Lucas are deeply committed to sustainability, and have a long history in this area. Shane’s family bought the wharf and opened the neighboring restaurant back in the 1970s. This casual cafe/market is an order-at-the-counter setup, and the lines might well be long when you walk in during the lunch rush. But be patient and you’ll be rewarded by generous portions of well-prepared fare at fair prices.</p>
      <p>Take the crab cakes, for instance. Those golden beauties, fried crispy in a panko crust, are under $20. That might be considered expensive at a fish and chips joint, but the kitchen takes the meal in a slightly fancy direction by serving those crab cakes on a bed of fresh greens. A very nice touch. As is the all-star condiment selection, which includes excellent tartar sauce, chipotle mayo and an Asian-style sweet chili sauce.</p>
      <p><b>Insider tip:</b> There’s a long list of local beer on tap, as well as an extensive selection of wine available in the cooler. It’s also a good spot to load up on high-end chocolate, with Berkeley-based <a href="https://tcho.com/">Tcho</a>’s almond and sea salt standing out on the shelf.</p>
