      <h1>Big tech racing to replace smartphones with smart glasses</h1>

      <p>Big tech companies are racing for their next big business: getting you to set down your iPhone and pick up a pair of smart glasses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/smart-glasses-that-replace-phones-may-be-the-next-hottest-tech-trend.html">CNBC </a>reported that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/amazon">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/google">Google </a>and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/apple">Apple </a>are some of the companies working on computers that we wear on our faces instead of the phone versions we cradle all day long.</p>

      <p>But these things can take time, and the switch won’t happen right away, or even soon.</p>
      <p>Currently, smart glasses are too big and expensive; at some point the price will come down, though, and the size will be small enough for everyday use. As a point of comparison, think of the earliest cellphones, which were the size, shape and heft of your average brick.</p>

      <p>Microsoft, as CNBC reported, is joining the race with its HoloLens 2 headset, which launched last week, and originally was being tested by the Army to make soldiers more effective on the battlefield.</p>
      <p>Apple will put out a version in 2022, the size of the Oculus Quest virtual reality headset. In 2023, Apple will launch a smaller version that can be worn all day instead of just around the house.</p>

      <p>Amazon hasn’t been as up front in the race; for now it has the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/amazon-echo-buds-earbuds-loop-ring-and-frames-glasses-a-first-look.html">Echo Frames that are currently just a set of regular glasses</a>, but with a speaker and the Amazon voice assistant Alexa built in.</p>
      <p>Originally the first one out of the gate was Google, but its <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2015/06/26/google-glass-epic-fail-what-happened.html">much-maligned</a> product was too radical and too early for people's tastes.</p>

      <p>In 2012, Google unveiled the first version of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/dont-look-now-but-google-glass-is-back">Google Glass</a>, garnering widespread attention, but it soon fizzled as a consumer product because of privacy concerns and its unattractive aesthetics.</p>
      <p>People who wore it were termed "gla__holes" because of the creepy nature of using the device. Google went so far as to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/glasscomms/glass-explorers">write</a> a best practices for using it, including listing the "do's" and "don'ts" of using it in public, even mentioning the term "gla__hole" in the post.</p>
