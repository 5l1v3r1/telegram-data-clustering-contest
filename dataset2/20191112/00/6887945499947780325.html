      <h1>Betye Saar Wins the Wolfgang Hahn Prize 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">BLOUIN ARTINFO</a></address>
      <p>American artist <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/betye-saar-3366">Betye Saar</a> (b. 1926) will be awarded the 2020 Wolfgang Hahn Prize from the Gesellschaft fur Moderne Kunst, Germany. The prize grants the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, a maximum of 100,000 € with which to acquire the winning artist’s work for its permanent collection. A prize giving ceremony for Saar will take place on April 21, 2020.</p>
      <p>A Los-Angeles native, Saar is renowned for a political oeuvre that explosively confronts issues of race and gender. As a child, she was a great collector of ephemera, and often repaired objects; during graduate and postgraduate studies at no less than four different Californian universities, she developed this natural inclination into an artistic practice based around assemblage. She began to create work from found materials that reflect her own mixed ancestry; African-American, Irish and Native American. Her practice features drawing, prints, painting, photography, but she is best known for eloquent assemblages of everyday objects.</p>
      <p>Her early important solo exhibitions include “Black Girl’s Window” at the Berkeley Art Center in California (1972) and “<a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/betye-saar-3366">Betye Saar</a>” at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1975). Saar’s latest solo exhibitions in the United States opened in autumn 2019, “<a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/betye-saar-3366">Betye Saar</a>: Call and Response” at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and “<a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/betye-saar-3366">Betye Saar</a>: The Legends of Black Girl’s Window” at MoMA.</p>
      <p>The artist has been awarded six honorary doctorates and has received multiple lifetime achievement awards.</p>
      <p>Chairwoman Mayen Beckmann has commented on what Saar’s win means for the Museum Ludwig, “We are delighted to honor <a href="https://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/betye-saar-3366">Betye Saar</a>, an artist whose great work is rooted in American art. She will add a previously missing, central position to the collection of the Museum Ludwig, in which many American artists are represented. In her wide-ranging oeuvre—which draws from shamanistic, religious, and philosophical sources, is composed of found items, and is politically motivated by ‘black feminism’—she takes us into her own world, which oscillates between dream, memory, and experience.”</p>
      <p>The Wolfgang Hahn Prize from the Gesellschaft fur Moderne Kunst, now in its 26th year, recognizes contemporary artists who have already made a name for themselves in the international art community at large, but are relatively undiscovered in Germany. The prize includes an exhibition to display the pieces of the artist’s work bought by its acquisition fund, as well as the creation of an accompanying publication.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Wolfgang Hahn Prize jury consisted of Yilmaz Dziewior, director of the Museum Ludwig, and Christophe Cherix, Robert Lehman Foundation chief curator of drawings and prints at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, along with the board members of the association.</p>
      <p>An exhibition of works the prize fund has been used to acquire from Saar will run at the Museum Ludwig from April 22, through July 26, 2020. Its accompanying book will be the first German-language publication on the artist.</p>
