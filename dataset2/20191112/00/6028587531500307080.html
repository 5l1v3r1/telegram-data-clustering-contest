      <h1>Director Sammi Cannold Brings A Groundbreaking Evita To City Center</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jeryl Brunner</a></address>
      <p>Director Sammi Cannold first saw the Broadway show <i>Evita</i> when she was in high school. She was immediately deeply captivated by the story and by the woman at its center, Eva Perón. “I couldn't wrap my head around how a young woman, who started out on her journey at my age, could make the extraordinary assent she made,” says Cannold. “I was obsessed with what it meant for her personally to be at the epicenter of the tornado that was her life.”</p>

      <p>She read every biography she could get her hands on. She was so taken with Eva Perón’s story, Cannold ultimately took a grant-funded research trip to Argentina in her junior year of college and then directed the show as her thesis. Cannold has since gone back to Argentina for research twice as Perón’s story continues to hit her hard. “I suppose you can say, in different ways as I've gotten older, I’m now the age Eva was when she became first lady, so that adds a whole new perspective for me.”</p>
      <p>From November 13 to November 24 Cannold brings her unique perspective to a groundbreaking new production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s rock-opera <i>Evita</i> at <a href="https://www.nycitycenter.org/pdps/2019-2020/evita/">New York City Center</a>. The musical dissects the life of Argentina’s first lady from her ascent until her death when she was just 33 years-old. In this production there will be an Eva and a young teenaged Eva.</p>
      <p>Cannold, who was the youngest female director to direct at the esteemed American Repertory Theater (A.R.T), is devoted to telling stories in daring and unique ways that play particular attention to context. At A.R.T. she directed a masterful production of the musical <i>Violet</i> on a moving 37-seat bus. It stoped at various locations in Violet’s world. Cannold also staged a site-specific <i>Ragtime</i> in the Registry Room on Ellis Island where a stage was built in the hall. </p>
      <p>As a storyteller Cannold feels a deep responsibility to investigate what it means to tell the story of Eva Perón in the context of understanding the place and time in which she lived. In fact, in preparation of this production Cannold and the show’s associate director, Rebecca Aparicio, spent three weeks in Argentina this past summer. They interviewed a vast and eclectic range of people, including those whose lives were affected by Perón’s regime and Perón’s private nurse and confidante, María Eugenia Alvarez, who cared for Perón at the end of her life in 1951 and 1952.</p>
      <p>“We, in the very generalized sense of the word, tend to think of Evita as an icon—as a white ballgown, as arms raised in a V, as a blonde bun,” says Cannold. “My hope is that this production shows you more of the human underneath all of that and gives you access to what she's thinking and feeling as she's going through the wild highs and lows of her life.”</p>
      <p>Cannold also hopes this City Center production helps people reflect on their own relationships to power, achievement, and legacy. “To me, this woman was a mastermind in all three realms. And there's a lot we can learn from her choices,” adds Cannold. “Good and bad.”</p>

        <b>Jeryl Brunner: Can you talk more about your concept for this production and how you arrived at it? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sammi Cannold: </b>When I first saw the musical as a teenager, I was really struck by the lyric, “There was nowhere she'd been at the age of fifteen.” Eva has always been played professionally by women much older than 15, so I couldn't help but wonder what it would feel like to have a girl of that age—of my age—portraying what was the very rocky start to this woman's life. This passion deepened when reading Evita biographies. I discovered that Agustín Magaldi, (whom Eva is intimate with in act I of the musical), was 36 at the time, making her 21 years his junior and certainly unable to consent if that interaction indeed happened.</p>
      <p>The biographies I read also cited several other incidents of rape and assault in Eva's young life. And for a figure who has a reputation of being a “slut” and a “whore,” it felt critical to change those words to “victim” and “survivor.”</p>
      <p>All to say in our production of the musical, we have Eva and Young Eva. The latter is a teenage actress who plays the role at 15. So when we see her standing next to Magaldi, and all the other men she stands next to throughout her life, we understand what that means, particularly through the lens of our now modern eyes, which interpret these issues differently than they were interpreted in the 70s. We can put Eva in dialogue with herself in service of the above goal of humanizing her and gaining access to her internal dialogue. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Brunner: Did you have the opportunity to talk to the original creators about your concept? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Cannold:</b> I got to talk with Tim Rice when I was in London this fall, which was so deeply meaningful to me. We met for tea and I asked him all sorts of questions about the work and how to execute this version in a way that properly respects the source material. I haven't yet met Andrew Lloyd Webber, but I'm very actively in communication with the powers-that-be at his company the Really Useful Group. They approve essentially everything we're doing, including the casting of every member of our company and the hiring of all members of our creative team.  </p>
      <p>I met Hal Prince once when I was in high school and I'll never forget the many times I got to see him speak. But I'm so exceptionally sad to say I never got to ask him about Evita. He was initially very interested in having three Evas in his production and I so wish I could know more about what was going on in his head when he thought about the execution of that idea.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brunner: You did so much research in advance of this production. What did your latest trip to Argentina entail? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Cannold:</b> I spent three weeks in Argentina this summer, most with the show's associate director Rebecca Aparicio, doing research in different towns and cities. In Buenos Aires, we did research at Museo Evita (the museum dedicated to Eva's life), at her tomb in Recoleta Cemetery, at the Casa Rosada. In Los Toldos, which is the town where she was born, we did research at Museo Casa Natal Maria Eva Duarte and got to visit the home where she grew up. In Junín, we got to visit the train station where she would have left for Buenos Aires as well as the house where she lived and the city's archives.</p>
      <p>And perhaps of most note, in Longchamps, we got to interview a 92-year-old woman named María Eugenia Álvarez, who was Evita's nurse and confidant throughout her battle with cancer in 1951 and 1952. We conducted about 30 interviews over the course of our time in Argentina and all of them have influenced the creation of the piece in very meaningful ways.</p>
