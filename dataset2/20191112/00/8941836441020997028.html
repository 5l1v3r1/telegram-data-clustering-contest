      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - The Latest on former President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a>’s surgery at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emory-university-hospital/">Emory University Hospital</a> (all times local):</p>
      <p>10:10 a.m.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a>’s spokeswoman says the former president is recovering at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emory-university-hospital/">Emory University Hospital</a> following surgery to relieve pressure from bleeding on his brain.</p>
      <p>Deanna Congileo says there were no complications from the surgery.</p>
      <p>She says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> will remain in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emory-university-hospital/">hospital</a> for observation, and she doesn’t anticipate making more announcements until he’s released.</p>

      <p>Former U.S. President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a> was going into surgery Tuesday morning at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emory-university-hospital/">Emory University Hospital</a> to relieve pressure on his brain, his spokeswoman said.</p>

        <p>The procedure is meant to resolve bleeding due to his recent falls, Deanna Congileo said in a statement.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> has fallen at least three times this year. The first incident, in the spring, required hip replacement surgery. He hit his head falling again on Oct. 6 and received 14 stitches, but still traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to help build a Habitat for Humanity home shortly thereafter. And he was briefly hospitalized after fracturing his pelvis on Oct. 21.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> also received a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015, announcing that melanoma had spread. After partial removal of his liver, treatment for brain lesions, radiation and immunotherapy, he said he was cancer-free.</p>
