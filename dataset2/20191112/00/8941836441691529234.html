      <p>BERLIN (AP) - A Berlin zoo says a giant panda whose twin cubs have captured international attention has undergone a CT scan after veterinarians discovered one of his kidneys was smaller than the other.</p>
      <p>The zoo said Tuesday that 9-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jiao-qing/">Jiao Qing</a> was examined last week by experts at the city’s Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research after the discrepancy was picked up on an ultrasound.</p>
      <p>The 110-kilogram (243-pound) bear underwent the scan while under anesthesia. Doctors confirmed one kidney is smaller.</p>
      <p>The panda’s urine will be tested to determine whether the smaller kidney is functioning properly. Even if not, animals can live healthy lives with only one kidney.</p>
