      <p>On Sunday, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/viacom-and-cbs-shake-up-executive-ranks-ahead-of-combination-11573423662"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a> broke the news that Comedy Central’s longtime president, Kent Alterman, would depart the cable channel as part of part company Viacom’s upcoming merger with CBS in December. In his stead, Chris McCarthy – who currently oversees MTV, VH1, CMT and Logo – would step in to handle all things Comedy Central, TV Land and Paramount Network.<a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/viacomcbs-shuffle-kent-alterman-out-chris-mccarthy-david-nevins-gain-turf-1202782512/"><i>Deadline</i></a> seemingly confirmed the news early Monday and, shortly thereafter, Viacom made it official.</p>
      <p>“ViacomCBS will be one of the largest premium content creators in the world, with the capacity to produce content for both our own platforms and for others,” said Viacom CEO Bob Bakish in a statement that mentioned neither Alterman nor Sarah Levy, the outgoing COO of Viacom’s Media Networks group. “This talented team of content leaders will work together to ensure we realize the full power of our brands, our deep relationships with the creative community and our intellectual property to drive our growth as a combined company.”</p>
      <p>Despite Bakish and company’s evident desire to move on, many Comedy Central showrunners, writers, producers, comics and other talent – past and present – chimed in on social media to wish Alterman their best. Like <i>Broad City</i> co-creator and co-star Abbi Jacobson, who claimed her show was “fought for” by the outgoing network president.</p>
      <p><i>The Daily Show</i> and <i>Inside Amy Schumer</i> alum Daniel Powell, who has since gone on to work on Netflix’s <i>I Think You Should Leave</i>, also contributed to the discussion, noting that Alterman had “greenlit some of the most influential comedies of the last 2 decades.”</p>
      <p>This quickly dovetailed into a brief bit about the executive’s apparent flair for inserting jokes into his press release comments.</p>
      <p>Yet, perhaps one of the greatest tributes to Alterman’s presence at Comedy Central came from <i>Review</i>’s Andy Daly, who shared a lovely story about the executive’s failed attempt to squash the iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uloT8V6Skgk">“15 Pancakes” segment</a> from the critically acclaimed series’s first season.</p>
      <p>Sure, Comedy Central’s recent knack for greenlighting and fostering beautifully funny and inventive scripted shows probably won’t disappear entirely when Alterman leaves. Though the <i>Semi-Pro</i> director turned television executive will be missed when he goes. After all, some of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/23/defining-comedy-sketches-last-years-rick-james-lazy-sunday/?arc404=true">best sketch comedy</a> in recent memory owes its existence to his influence at Comedy Central.</p>
