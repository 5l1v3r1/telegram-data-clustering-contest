      <p>As the world’s most famous stage, the <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/">Royal Albert Hall</a>, having hosted everyone from Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, The Beatles and Beyoncé, was the ideal location for the latest sold-out session of <a href="http://letterslive.com/">Letters Live</a> last month. Who would have thought an event where the audience listens to letters being read out would become a sell-out event everywhere it happens? In fact, Letters Live has become so popular that it has outgrown previous venues like London’s <a href="https://www.unionchapel.org.uk/">Union Chapel</a> because a 900 person capacity simply isn’t large enough. Since 2013 the event has been staged over sixty times, including performances in New York, Brixton Prison, Los Angeles and the Calais Jungle. The Royal Albert Hall show was performed to an eager audience of more than 5,000.</p>

      <p>Letters Live premiered in 2013 at London’s <a href="https://www.tabernaclew11.com/">Tabernacle</a> in Notting Hill and quickly established itself as a powerful and original event format, attracting well-known performers who bring remarkable letters to life. The event was inspired by Shaun Usher’s international best-selling <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/"><i>Letters of Note </i>series</a> and Simon Garfield’s <a href="https://www.simongarfield.com/books/to-the-letter/"><i>To the Letter.</i></a><i> </i>The independent British publishing house <a href="https://canongate.co.uk/">Canongate</a>, is the genius behind Letters Live, along with their partner, the independent film and television production company, <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnymarchltd?lang=en">Sunnymarch</a>, founded by Benedict Cumberbatch and Adam Ackland.</p>

      <p>Each show always features a completely different array of performers, reading engaging letters written over the centuries and from around the world. And each audience for Letters Live doesn’t know who the performers will be as the line up is never announced in advance. However, after six years, audiences know there’s a good chance some of the regulars like Stephen Fry and Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a co-producer of Letters Live, will be there. For a previous event at Union Chapel, in Islington, London hosted by Mariella Frostrup, Kristin Scott Thomas reprised her role as the Queen Elizabeth II writing a letter to President Eisenhower and enclosed a recipe for her drop scones so admired by the President. Helen McCrory as Clemmie Churchill, gently admonished her husband Winston at the beginning of the Second World War for his curmudgeonly behavior towards his fellow politicians. A letter from Florence Nightingale was particularly moving as she detailed her attempts to treat thousands of soldiers in the appalling conditions of the Crimean War.</p>

      <p>Letters Live at the Royal Albert Hall last month was a thrilling combination of drama, pathos and humor. The letters were read by thirteen performers: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi, Louise Brealey, Alan Carr, Asim Chaudrhy, Crystal Clarke, Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Paul Ryan, Rory Stewart, Taika Waititi and Florence Welch</p>

      <p>Act 1 was opened by Stephen Fry with “A deplorable incident,” a hilarious letter of complaint to the manager of the Royal Albert Hall about the naughty activities of a couple in one of the boxes. Later, in one of the most dramatic points of the evening, MP Rory Stewart came on stage, announced his resignation from the Conservative party (he’s now running as an Independent in the 2020 London mayoral election) and then read an excerpt of a letter “A gross failure of responsibility” written in 1982 by Martin Hammond, Master in College at Eton, to Stanley Johnson about a troublesome pupil at the school, Stanley’s son, Boris Johnson. Olivia Colman, just prior to appearing on our TV screens as Queen Elizabeth in the new season of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80025678">The Crown</a>, read “We must win afterall,” a letter to her mother, Queen Mary in The Blitz during the Second World War . Several performers read letters of their own. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi read a letter written to an imaginary fiance, while Stephen Fry wrote a letter to a fan suffering from depression. Benedict Cumberbatch closed the night with a reading of Wallace Stegner’s letter predicting the demise of the natural environment which led to the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the protection of 9.1 million acres of land in the US. The October show also featured two music guests, with Damon Albarn and Sampha providing piano-led performances.</p>

      <p>Letters Live is not only excellent entertainment, it’s for a good cause. The proceeds of each event is donated to a different charity. After the Royal Albert Hall event, co-producer Benedict Cumberbatch said: “it’s been remarkable to be part of the journey that Letters Live has been on these past six years - from such humble beginnings to this sold-out night at the historic Royal Albert Hall. We were so lucky tonight in the depth and breadth of talent who gave of their time and skill and it is wonderful to be raising much needed funds to the National Literacy Trust, a truly important literacy charity that is doing such crucial work to support reading and writing across the UK.”</p>
      <p>The next Letters Live will be at <a href="http://letterslive.com/event/letters-live-manchester/">Manchester’s Palace Theatre</a>, 6 December 2019.</p>
