      <p>Sainsbury’s is to round off its 150th birthday celebrations by unveiling a Christmas advert harking back to its roots in 1869, in the hope of enticing new customers over the vital holiday period.</p>
      <p>The advert tells the story of Nicholas, a young chimney sweep whose work master steals a hat full of clementines from the store.</p>
      <p>The scene opens at the brand new J Sainsbury’s store in Victorian London’s Drury Lane, showing off its wares to the street.</p>
      <p>Nicholas’s boss grabs the fruit, but the poor boy is caught red-handed as he bends down to pick up a clementine that has fallen to the ground.</p>
      <p>Banished from London, young Nick is rescued by Mary Ann Sainsbury who, having seen the whole event, sets off to the snowy mountains to fetch him back.</p>

      <p>As she gives him a bag of clementines, the boy says he cannot pay for them.</p>
      <p>But Mrs Sainsbury retorts: “If you can’t do something special for someone at Christmas, then when can you?”</p>
      <p>Nick then jumps down the chimney of the Manor House Children’s Home, filling the youngsters’ stockings with clementines, before walking off into the sunset wearing a red cape and hat.</p>
      <p>The team behind the advert admitted they took liberties with history.</p>
      <p>For instance, the first ever Sainsbury’s store only sold milk, eggs and butter, with no clementines in sight, according to Sainsbury’s website.</p>
      <p>Perhaps more shocking is that the Shard and London Eye form part of the 1869 London skyline, or that it says “Emissions free” on the side of Mrs Sainsbury’s horse-drawn cart.</p>
      <p>“Some of it’s based on true events; there was a shop in 1869 that was open for Christmas,” said Laura Boothby, the supermarket’s head of broadcast marketing.</p>
      <p>Filmed in Romania, where the team found a ready-made Dickensian London film set, the short piece is designed to cheer people up.</p>
      <p>“The ambition of our Christmas ad every year is just to create festive joy, people don’t want to see miserable ads … hopefully people just want a bit of cheering up, and this will help with that,” Ms Boothby added.</p>
      <p>The advert went live online in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and will get its first broadcast screening on ITV during Emmerdale at 7.15pm.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury’s did not reveal how much it had spent on the ad, but businesses across the UK are expected to fork out a record £6.8 billion on seasonal promotion, according to the Advertising Association.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury’s follows Argos, and rivals Asda and Iceland in rolling out their Christmas TV ads.</p>
