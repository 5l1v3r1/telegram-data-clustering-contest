      <h1>Gus Casely-Hayford Appointed as Director of V&amp;A East, London</h1>

      <p>The V&amp;A Museum has named Gus Casely-Hayford OBE as the inaugural director of V&amp;A East in London. The role will see Casely-Hayford head up possibly the V&amp;A’s most ambitious expansion project to date: the creation of an entirely new museum and an accompanying research center. He will assume the role from spring 2020.</p>
      <p>A celebrated British curator, cultural historian, broadcaster, Casely-Hayford was born in London to a prominent Ghanaian family. Since gaining a PhD in African History from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), he has lectured internationally and advised organizations from the Tate to the Royal Shakespeare Company. His presenter credits include two series of Tate Britain’s “Great British Walks” (2017-2018) for Sky Arts, BBC Two’s “The Culture Show” and two series of “Lost Kingdoms of Africa” (2010-2012) for BBC Four, for which he also wrote a companion book. He has sat on the boards of a number of arts institutions including the National Trust, the Caine Prize for African Writing, and London’s National Portrait Gallery. Casely-Hayford currently serves as the Director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art in Washington DC, but he and his family will relocate back to London for him to assume his new role at the V&amp;A.</p>
      <p>V&amp;A East will be perhaps the most significant project in the museum’s long history. It will see a dedicated new five-story museum built in east London – at Stratford Waterfront, near the site of the Olympic Park, UAL’s London College of Fashion and new BBC studios. The museum’s displays will be drawn from a partnership between the V&amp;A and the Smithsonian, making Casely-Hayford’s links to the US institution extremely useful. Its exhibits will be multidisciplinary, spanning the arts, humanities, science, and nature; uniting two of the world’s largest and most eclectic collections to tell diverse stories.</p>
      <p>Alongside the museum, a new collection and research center will be purpose-built. The facility, Here East, will house more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books, and 1,000 archives, serving as a hub for international scholarship.</p>
      <p>Both the V&amp;A East and Here East are set to open in 2023, as part of a wider scheme to designate the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as a seat of culture. The East Bank initiative is intended to continue the legacy of the London 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>In his role as the new director of V&amp;A East, Casely-Hayford will be responsible for the creative strategy and programming across V&amp;A East’s two new venues. He will report to V&amp;A Director, Tristram Hunt, and the V&amp;A’s Deputy Director, Chief Operating Officer, and V&amp;A East project lead, Tim Reeve.</p>
      <p>Reeve has expressed confidence in Casely-Hayford’s leadership for the project, “I’m delighted that Gus is joining the V&amp;A to lead and launch V&amp;A East. This is a hugely ambitious project – for east London, for the UK, and for international cultural exchange. It offers us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform</p>
      <p>how we engage young, diverse audiences, and to revolutionize how our collections are accessed and experienced. We cast the net wide to find a creative leader of the highest standing, and with his prestigious career and background, Gus is perfectly placed to lead V&amp;A East’s growing team and to develop its new identity, purpose, and program.”</p>
