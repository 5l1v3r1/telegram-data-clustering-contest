      <p>Anheuser-Busch InBev has agreed to purchase the remainder of Craft Brew Alliance, increasing its footprint in the “craft” beer space.InBev already owned 31% of the company and had previously said it did not intend to buy out the entire company.</p>
      <p>Craft Brew Alliance includes Redhook Ale, Widmer Brothers Brewery, Kona Brewing Company, Omission Beer, and Square Mile Cider. The company also has brewing and distribution partnerships with Appalachian Mountain Brewery from Boone, North Carolina; Cisco Brewing, Inc from Nantucket, Massachusetts; and Wynwood Brewing from Miami, Florida.</p>
      <p>The purchase adds to AbInBev’s growing number of “craft” brands. Over the years, the beer giant has purchased a number of breweries individually, once growing them together under an umbrella called “The High End.”</p>
      <p>Other breweries owned by the giant include Goose Island, Wicked Weed, 10 Barrel, Golden Road, Karbach, and Best Damn Brewing Company, amongst others.</p>
