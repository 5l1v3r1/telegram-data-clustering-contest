      <h1>IHG to add two properties in Vietnam</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Nisha Shroff</a></address>
      <p>Further boosting its presence in Vietnam, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) has announced signing of an agreement with Ho Tram Project Company (HTP) to rebrand the latter’s integrated resort – The Grand Ho Tram hotel to Intercontinental Grand Ho Tram. Along with this, IHG is to also open Holiday Inn Resort Ho Tram Beach that is slated to be operational in 2020.</p>
      <p>Located at the Ho Tram Strip, the rebranded property, which is getting refurbished after a year, will feature 533 guestrooms, three dining outlets and a well-equipped convention centre that can accommodate up to 1,300 guests. Other leisure facilities include a fitness centre, a spa, a golf course, and some entertainment options.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the 502-key Holiday Inn Resort Ho Tram Beach will focus on family-family facilities that include swimming pools and a rooftop bar. Additionally, the hotel will offer direct access to other facilities such as a cinema, food court and water park among others.</p>
      <p>Serena Lim, vice president, development for IHG southeast Asia and Korea, said, “This signing marks a new milestone in our growth in Vietnam, as we welcome our first Holiday Inn Resort in the country and continue to expand our Intercontinental brand. As international and domestic travel continues to grow, the expansion of the property and facilities puts us in a great position to provide different experiences for a diverse group of guests.”</p>
      <p>Michael Kelly, chairman and CEO of HTP, said, “We are delighted to continue our long-standing partnership with IHG with the developments on the Ho Tram Strip. IHG has an impressive track record in Vietnam with a large presence and is a strong brand-fit for our properties with both Intercontinental and Holiday Inn. Together, we look forward to hosting guests and delivering memorable experiences here in Ho Tram.”</p>
