      <p><b>Topline: </b>With Alibaba’s Singles’ Day, the world’s biggest shopping festival, bringing in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/11/alibabas-1111-singles-day-by-the-numbers-a-record-38-billion-haul/#51838fce2772">record $38.4 billion haul</a> this year, a handful of brands like Apple, L’Oréal and Nestlé were among the biggest winners, grossing hundreds of millions in sales.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alibaba said on Tuesday that 15 different companies each grossed over $143 million (1 billion yuan) in sales: Chinese brands Huawei and Xiaomi, U.S. brands Bose, Estée Lauder, Gap, Levi’s, Nike, The North Face and Apple, and other international brands Nestlé, H&amp;M, Uniqlo, MUJI, L’Oréal and Philips. </li>
        <li>Almost 300 different brands <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singles-day-alibaba-brands/loreal-nestle-score-big-at-alibabas-singles-day-shopping-fest-idUSKBN1XM0QU">each sold</a> over $14.3 million (100 million yuan) in gross merchandise value during Singles’ Day: Those included LVMH’s Givenchy, sportswear manufacturer Under Armour and home appliance makers Dyson and Philips.</li>
        <li>Food and beverage brands like Starbucks and Mondelez also did “very well,” Alibaba’s chief marketing officer, Chris Tung, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-singles-day-shopping-party-gives-a-boost-to-us-brands-180834305.html">told</a> Yahoo Finance.</li>
        <li>The most popular import products sold on Singles’ Day were food supplements, followed by makeup, diapers and face wash, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singles-day-alibaba-brands/loreal-nestle-score-big-at-alibabas-singles-day-shopping-fest-idUSKBN1XM0QU">reported</a>.</li>
        <li>International orders made up a big portion of sales this year: The most popular products among Chinese consumers came from Japan, the U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany, according to Alibaba.</li>
        <li>Alibaba rival JD.com, which started its sales campaign on November 1, 2019, sold <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singles-day-alibaba-brands/loreal-nestle-score-big-at-alibabas-singles-day-shopping-fest-idUSKBN1XM0QU">more than $29 billion</a> over the 11 days leading up to Singles’ Day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> In the eleventh edition of Singles’ Day, or 11/11, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/11/alibabas-1111-singles-day-by-the-numbers-a-record-38-billion-haul/#51838fce2772">set a new sales record</a> of $38.4 billion in gross merchandise volume over the 24-hour shopping bonanza. The total number of delivery orders on 11/11 also increased 24% to 1.29 billion, compared to 1.04 billion last year.</p>
      <p><b>Surprising fact:</b> 90% of sales on Singles’ Day in China happened via smartphone—“a rate completely unheard of in the U.S.,” Adobe executive Taylor Shreiner wrote in a <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/why-chinas-popular-singles-day-hasnt-taken-off-in-the-us/">blog post</a>. “Singles’ Day payment systems, phone games and mobile live streams are all elements that could effectively be ported to the U.S. and elsewhere.” </p>
