      <p>PARIS (AP) - The next European Commission president says she wants to spend almost a third more on foreign policy goals over the next half decade to better establish the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/european-union/">EU</a> as a global player.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ursula-von-der-leyen/">Ursula von der Leyen</a> said Tuesday that the extra money is needed to develop a stronger strategic culture of the bloc, which is often criticized as high on ideals but low on effective impact.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ursula-von-der-leyen/">Von der Leyen</a> said at the Paris Peace Forum that “there is need for stable and responsible leadership. We all have to contribute.”</p>
