      <p>Ohio State currently owns the top ranking in this week’s college football playoff rankings and, according to one bookmaker, Saturday’s Big Ten matchup against Rutgers sees them own the largest spread in conference history.The 51.5-point line clearly stands out on this weeks <a href="https://www.sportsbetting.ag/sportsbook/football/ncaa">college football odds grid</a>, but SportsBetting.ag head oddsmaker Adam Burns feels confident in the decision to set such a high bar.</p>
      <p>"The way the Buckeyes are absolutely dominating on both sides of the ball, coupled with the dreadful Rutgers offense, this was always going to be a spread of epic proportions," said Burns. "But Ohio State is probably going to have to pitch a shutout to cover the number."</p>
      <p>Burns’ reference to a shutout is in direct relation to the game’s betting total which, at 55.5 points, leaves little wiggle room for the Buckeyes should the Scarlet Knights get on the board.</p>
      <p>A single Rutgers touchdown would see Ohio State needing a total of 59 points or more to narrowly secure the cover.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rutgers Embracing The Role Of The Dog?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aside from their season opener where they were favored by 17-points over UMass, Rutgers have found themselves pegged as underdogs by at least seven points in all matchups since.</p>
      <p>As for the topic of history, this marks the largest spread the Scarlet Knights have ever faced, with the previous high being a 41 points, a line they faced against Notre Dame in 1996 as well as Syracuse in 1998.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes’ previous spread record was seen in their 2013 matchup against Florida A&amp;M, where Ohio State was a hefty 48-point favorite.</p>
      <p>SportsBettings’ Adam Burns dug through the college football database to verify if this was the largest spread in recorded college football betting history. With their records going all the way back to the 1985 season, Burns shared that a 1989 Southwest Conference matchup between SMU and Houston featured a spread of 59, while a Big 8 mismatch between Oklahoma and Kansas State saw oddsmakers set the line at 57-points.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ohio State Eying Ninth National Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>With eight titles to their name, the Buckeyes look to return to the biggest stage in college football, and oddsmakers are liking their their chances to claim the title they last held in 2014.</p>
      <p>The LSU Tigers are coming off of a massive win over rival and title contender, Alabama, and many would argue that their impressive resume makes them the team to beat.</p>
      <p>Tigers’ QB Joe Burrow is the Heisman favorite, and his composure under pressure leaves little to question when stakes are at their highest.</p>
