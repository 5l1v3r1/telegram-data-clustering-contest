      <p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Nov 12 — The private SpaceX company yesterday launched a second set of mini-satellites as it builds a huge constellation of the small orbiting devices aimed at greatly expanding internet access around the globe.</p>
      <p>A Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, placed 60 mini-satellites in orbit, joining 60 others launched in May.</p>
      <p>The American company's Starlink network could one day total 42,000 satellites — resulting in far more crowded skies and raising concerns among some scientists.</p>
      <p>Scenes of the launch were broadcast live by SpaceX, a company created by the entrepreneurial Elon Musk, who is also chief executive of Tesla Inc.</p>
      <p>SpaceX's goal is to control a huge share of the future internet market from space.</p>
      <p>But several rivals have the same ambition, including London-based startup OneWeb and giant US retailer Amazon, whose Project Kuiper is far less advanced.</p>
      <p>Musk hopes eventually to control 3 to 5 per cent of the global internet market — a share valued at US$30 billion (RM123.8 billion) a year, or 10 times what SpaceX is earning from its space launches.</p>
      <p>Musk's ultimate goal is to finance the development of his rockets and space vessels. SpaceX's boss entertains a long-time dream of colonizing Mars.</p>
      <p>His California-based company has so far received authorisation from US authorities to launch 12,000 satellites in several different orbits, and it has applied to launch as many as 30,000 more.</p>
      <p>Starlink is designed to provide high-speed internet connections on Earth.</p>
      <p>Its mini-satellites will orbit at relatively low altitude (550 kilometres for the first ones), allowing quick transmission times.</p>
      <p>SpaceX says its satellite constellation will be operational for Canada and the northern US by next year.</p>
      <p>It says 24 more launches will be needed to extend coverage to the entire globe.</p>
      <p>At present, there are slightly more than 2,100 active satellites in orbit around the Earth.</p>
      <p>The idea of adding 42,000 has some scientists worried.</p>
      <p>Astronomers say the proliferation of the bright metallic satellites could seriously degrade the night view, interfering with telescopes trained on space.</p>
      <p>Others fear that the far more crowded skies will result in expensive collisions between satellites. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
