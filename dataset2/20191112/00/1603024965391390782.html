      <p>Sawant, Shiv Sena’s lone member in the Union Cabinet had resigned on November 10 amid the political crisis in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Sawant’s resignation is being seen as a precursor to the Shiv Sena securing support of Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress.</p>
      <p>In a couple of tweets in Marathi, Sawant had said: “Before the (2019) Lok Sabha election, a seat and power sharing formula had been decided. Denying this now is an attempt at portraying Shiv Sena as a liar. It is not only shocking, but also an attempt to malign Maharashtra’s pride.”</p>
      <p>“Shiv Sena is with the truth. Why should I stay in the central government amid this atmosphere of falsehood? Hence, I am resigning as a Union Minister,” Sawant added.</p>
