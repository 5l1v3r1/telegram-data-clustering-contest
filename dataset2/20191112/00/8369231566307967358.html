      <h1>Incredibly Rare 'Mouse Deer' Spotted in Vietnam After Vanishing For Almost 30 Years</h1>

      <p>A very rare species of small, deer-like animal thought to be on the verge of extinction has been spotted in the northwestern jungle of Vietnam for the first time in nearly 30 years.</p>
      <p>Known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_mouse-deer">silver-backed chevrotain</a> or mouse deer, a specimen was last recorded in 1990, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1027-7">according to a study</a> published Monday in the journal <i>Nature Ecology and Evolution</i>.</p>
      <p>The species, <i>Tragulus versicolor</i>, was first described in 1910 based on several animals found near Nha Trang, about 450 kilometres (280 miles) northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
      <p>With no confirmed sightings since 1990, experts assumed the species must have been pushed to the brink of extinction by hunting.</p>

      <p>However Vietnamese biologist An Nguyen, who works with Global Wildlife Conservation and is a PhD student at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, had been wondering for years whether the silver-backed chevrotain might still be holding on somewhere.</p>
      <p>Working with colleagues Barney Long and Andrew Tilker, the experts got together with local villagers to sift through reported sightings.</p>
      <p>Some were consistent enough with the silver-backed chevrotain to justify putting up more than 30 motion-activated cameras in nearby forested habitats.</p>
      <p>"The results were amazing. I was overjoyed when we checked the camera traps and saw photographs of a chevrotain with silver flanks," said Nguyen.</p>
      <p>Tilker cautioned in a blog post however that "just because we found this species relatively easily doesn't mean it is not threatened".</p>
      <p>Forests in southeast Asia are under tremendous pressure from growing populations and development "so we need to get ahead of the curve" on conservation, Tilker added.</p>
      <p>In May, a United Nations body of biodiversity experts, known as IPBES, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/un-warns-of-biological-annihilation-up-to-a-million-animal-could-soon-be-extinct">issued a landmark report</a> warning that up to one million species face the risk of extinction due to humanity's impact on the planet.</p>
