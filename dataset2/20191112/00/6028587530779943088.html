      <p>Most hardcore Star Wars fan Disney Plus subscribers probably raced to watch <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/12/heres-what-disney-plus-was-hiding-about-the-mandalorian/#77037bef21ef">The Mandalorian</a> first thing today as soon as they got the service to start working. But right after they did after that? They probably went straight to the original trilogy. And pretty soon into <i>A New Hope</i>, they found themselves quite a surprise.There have been many different versions of the original <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy over the years, the originals, the Lucas remasters and additions, and one of the most infamous changes was to the cantina showdown between Han and Greedo.</p>
      <p>In the original trilogy, Han shoots first, roasting Greedo before he has a chance to fire. In the later Lucas edit, it’s Greedo who shoots first, and Han only fires back in retaliation. It’s a small moment and small change, yet has royally upset fans for years, given that it kind of changes the core of who Han’s character is supposed to be in that moment. Later, the scene was edited a tiny bit yet again, giving Han a weird little head dodge and moving the shots closer together.</p>
      <p>Now, we have <i>another</i> edit. This is not a joke.</p>
      <p>In the current version of <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i> on Disney Plus, we now have what could be the weirdest version yet. In it, Han says “I bet you have,” and then after that, when previously nothing else was spoken, Greedo suddenly screams something in Rodian that does not have a translation, but it sounds like “Mankunkey!” or something equally weird. Then the two fire in almost the exact same frame, Han does his little dodge, and Greedo goes down.</p>
      <p>The fact that this new edit exists is weird enough. How it got there is even weirder. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit">According to Disney</a>, this edit was actually made by George Lucas himself seven years ago before <i>Star Wars</i> was taken over by Disney. Allegedly it happened during a conversion for a 4K 3D re-release that never came to pass, but Lucas couldn’t resist one alteration to a scene that had already been edited to death, each version increasingly worse than the last.</p>
      <p>This time, the implication of the scene is that with Greedo screaming like an idiot out of nowhere, Han takes that as a threat, so he’s justified shooting before, or really, at the same time as Greedo, thanks to the advance warning. It takes a straightforward scene and makes it even more needlessly complicated, for the third or fourth time, mind you, and this is the version we’re now stuck with.</p>
      <p>I don’t quite understand what the deal is between Disney and Lucas and whether or not they’re allowed to access the older, less screwed-up versions of the original trilogy, but it does not seem like it, hence why we’re getting this sort of thing today. It’s yet another chapter in <i>Star Wars</i>’ dumbest saga, and one final bit of trolling from George Lucas. Well, hopefully final, we’ll see if any other changes are made as fans make their way through all the old films today.</p>
