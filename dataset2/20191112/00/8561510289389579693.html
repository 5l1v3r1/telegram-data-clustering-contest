      <h1>New Research: Vaping Is Incredibly Bad for Your Heart</h1>

      <p>The consensus that vaping is a <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/vape-lung-illness-death-switch-cigarettes">healthier alternative</a> to smoking cigarettes is crumbling away.</p>
      <p>That’s because new research shows that vaping can raise LDL cholesterol — that’s the bad kind — and decrease blood flow just like cigarettes do, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/vaping/e-cigarettes-hurt-heart-health-possibly-more-regular-cigarettes-n1079076">according to <i>NBC News</i></a>. In some ways, in fact, vapes appear to be even worse.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot we still don’t know about electronic cigarettes,” Boston University School of Medicine biologist Sana Majid told <i>NBC</i>. “It’s going to take time for us to understand how e-cigarettes affect your heart health.”</p>
      <p>Majid worked on one of the two new studies, both of which will be presented at an upcoming American Heart Association meeting.</p>
      <p>In one study, which examined 476 healthy participants, the smokers had higher LDL cholesterol and lower HLD cholesterol — that’s the good kind — than non-smokers, and it didn’t matter whether they had used cigarettes or vapes.</p>
      <p>The other study demonstrated that vapes dampened the heart’s ability to pump blood during exercise, a long-known health impact of smoking cigarettes. But even after the participants stopped exercising, vape smokers’ blood flow remained lessened whereas cigarette smokers’ returned to normal.</p>
      <p>“It’s evidence that there’s something wrong with the blood flow regulation in smokers and maybe even more so in e-cigarette smokers,” Florian Rader, a study author and the director of human physiology at LA’s Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told <i>NBC</i>.</p>
      <p>“These products are marketed as healthy alternatives, and yet we see more and more evidence that they’re definitely not healthy,” he said.</p>
