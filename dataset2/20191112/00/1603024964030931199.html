      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.</p>
      <p>The company last raised capital in February 2016 and was valued at around $6.5 billion. After its potential acquisition by Flipkart in 2017 <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/all-talk-no-shop-flipkart-snapdeal-and-other-startup-deals-that-never-saw-the-light-of-day-2564879.html">fell through</a>, co-founders Bahl and Bansal bought back 10 percent shares at a valuation below $100 million.</p>
      <p>The development follows ShopClues' acquisition by Singapore’s Qoo100 for below $100 million in October after a ShopClues and Snapdeal <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/snapdeal-unlikely-to-acquire-shopclues-sources-4113721.html">merger fell through in early 2019</a>. ShopClues was once valued at $1.1 billion.</p>
      <p>The new fundraiser is being looked at as a test for the co-founders’ ability to inspire confidence in investors <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/softbank-shows-interest-in-snapdeal-might-lead-100-million-round-4347531.html">after the value erosion</a>, the publication quoted a source saying.</p>
