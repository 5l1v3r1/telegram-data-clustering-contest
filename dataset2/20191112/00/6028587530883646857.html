      <p>Jedd Gyorko is not atop anyone’s free agent list. He’s not in anyone’s top ten. He might not be in anyone’s top fifty. That’s why he represents a nice potential value play for a team that could use infield depth and some help against left-handed pitching. After a miserable 2019, Gyorko won’t cost much and might even accept a minor league deal. Despite that, he might be worth a win or two of value, and could be a savvy pickup for any number of teams. In the middle of 2019, the Los Angeles Dodgers picked up Gyorko in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, Gyorko’s team from 2016 to that point. At the time, it seemed like a typical Dodgers move. Gyorko can play several positions and has a history of being platooned, playing mostly against lefty pitchers (though importantly, he’s not a disaster against righties). He also has shown real power in past seasons, launching thirty homers in 2016.</p>
      <p>This past season was a lost one for Gyorko. He spent much of the year on the injured list with back and wrist ailments. When he was on the field, the results resembled that of a player playing through pain. After three consecutive seasons with a wRC+ between 111 and 113 (meaning he was about 12% better as a hitter than league average), he put a paltry 36 wRC+ (64% worse than league average) with a pitcher-like .174/.248/.250 slash line.</p>
      <p>Gyorko is 31, and sometimes players of that age don’t have much left, but if he is recovered from his various injuries, there is no need to think that Gyorko’s 2019 represents anything close to a new level. That’s not to say that a bounceback is inevitable, but the uncertainty of what he’ll bring in 2020 will make him very affordable. A team spending a million or two dollars for his services risks getting nothing for that, but the upside is a two-win player who can slot in at first, second or third base. On a minor league deal, Gyorko makes sense for virtually any team, whether that’s a contender looking for depth or a rebuilding team looking to build his value and flip him at the deadline.</p>
      <p>As for Gyorko, this is a case where he might be able to prove his value to teams before they ink him to a deal. His walk rate stayed steady in 2019, and his strikeout rate and groundball rate ticked up a bit, but what really sunk him were pop-ups and a complete loss of power. Gyorko’s infield flyball rate more than doubled in 2019, and his isolated power was cut in half from his 2018 figure. There is no way to prove that one can hit Major League pitching other than doing it, but Gyorko may be able to show teams he has his strength back in the hopes of securing a guaranteed paycheck and roster spot.</p>
      <p>That’s all assuming that he’s got something left in the tank. Unless he’s broken beyond repair by his 2019 issues, that shouldn’t be too much of an issue. The composition of his offensive profile morphed from 2016 to 2018, but the overall output was quite consistent. With health, Jedd Gyorko ought to represent a great potential value for any team that isn’t overflowing with infield depth.</p>
