      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - The Hawaii Department of Transportation plans to use a new type of asphalt that could extend road life by years, officials said.</p>
      <p>Stone matrix asphalt may reduce the need for filling potholes, fixing cracks and performing other types of regular road maintenance, KHON-TV reported .</p>
      <p>The stronger and more flexible compound could last up to 25 years, officials said.</p>
      <p>“Overall way better product that we’ve gotten for the public at a cost of about 1.6 to two times the cost of materials,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-sniffen/">Ed Sniffen</a>, the state Deputy Director of Highways.</p>
      <p>A repaving project on Oahu’s Pali Highway added a layer of stone matrix asphalt on top of standard asphalt to make the road smoother and more durable, officials said.</p>

      <p>Transportation officials plan to expand use of the asphalt hybrid to various major road arteries.</p>
      <p>“We’re already looking toward the next corridors we can do it on,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-sniffen/">Sniffen</a> said, noting that the Nimitz Highway, part of Route 92 on Oahu, is scheduled for reconstruction and resurfacing.</p>
      <p>The department first experimented with the pavement on a 5-mile (8-kilometer) stretch of the Moanalua Freeway in 2004. It has held up very well, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-sniffen/">Sniffen</a> said.</p>
      <p>“That area is super smooth, doesn’t have any cracks in it, and we’ve not touched it or done anything on it for the last 15 years,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-sniffen/">Sniffen</a> said. “So we know it works, something that can give us life.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-sniffen/">Sniffen</a> cautioned drivers that a smooth ride can lead to a false sense of security. “If things are smoother, you don’t notice the speeds that you’re driving,” he said.</p>
