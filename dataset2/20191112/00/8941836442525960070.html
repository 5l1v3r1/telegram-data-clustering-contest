      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - Georgia officials have made appointments to the state medical marijuana commission, a key step toward implementing a law designed to increase patient access.</p>
      <p>Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and House Speaker David Ralston announced seven appointments Tuesday. They include several doctors, a professor, a police chief and a small business owner.</p>
      <p>The commission was authorized by legislation passed in April that allows for in-state production and sale of low-THC marijuana oil. It seeks to end a contradiction in Georgia’s original 2015 medical marijuana law that allowed some patients to possess the drug but made it impossible to legally obtain it.</p>

        <p>State law allows people with specific conditions like cancer and Parkinson’s disease to possess oil with less than 5% THC, the chemical that gets users high.</p>
