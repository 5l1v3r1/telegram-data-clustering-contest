      <p>London - The IMO should give <b>clear direction </b>on the preferred short-term measures to cut emissions putting climate change, and how to tackle it, at the top of its agenda. The message comes from the UK Chamber of Shipping that represents more than 140 shipping companies, among them many of the principle members of the International Chamber of Shipping.</p>
      <p>The UK body pushes the argument that “slow shipping is not the answer to cutting emissions,” because if ships are forced to slow down, “<b>we may need more vessels to transport the goods</b> we need. This would increase carbon emissions which we all want to avoid.”</p>
      <p>Shipping, recalls the UK Chamber of Shipping, in a press release, is <b>six times more efficient than trucks </b>and over 40 times more efficient than a freight aircraft as a mode of transport, but we know there is more to do to cut emissions and that is why we have called for a green industrial revolution to make the UK a world leader in developing the green technologies of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“But we know we can’t do this all by ourselves,” writes the IMO. Shipping is a global industry which requires global collaboration and global initiatives. Last year, IMO countries met in London and reached a milestone agreement to limit carbon emissions from shipping through the adoption of the initial Green House Gas (GHG) Strategy. The IMO is meeting this week to <b>discuss short-term measures </b>that will start delivering on its climate commitment deal by 2023. The meeting is going to see proposals from countries and organisations, many of which are built on previous submissions ranging from speed restrictions to goal-based approaches, including things like propeller upgrades and innovative paints, that support setting goals that allow shipowners to make their own choices tailored to their business.</p>
