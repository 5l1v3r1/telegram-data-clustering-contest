      <p><a href="https://www.nanushka.com/">Nanushka</a> has seemingly cooked up a recipe for instant success. In three years, the Budapest-based sustainable fashion label, founded by Sandra Sandor, has garnered the fervor of fashion editors; is stocked at major retailers like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue; increased its revenue by nearly 25 times; and recently opened a 3,300-square-foot store at the posh SoHo neighborhood in New York. But what may appear to be a 30-minute meal—a speedy trajectory to the top—was actually a slow roast. The brand was founded in 2006, nearly a decade before it became a burgeoning force in the industry. So, what was the missing ingredient that added the necessary kick? Evidently, it was basic business acumen. Before 2016, Nanushka was effectively hemorrhaging money, operating on a scale that isn’t conducive to running a successful global company. </p>
      <p>Indeed, Nanushka wasn’t lacking in its creative output. Throughout her career, Sandor has designed forward-thinking collections for men and women that imbue a timeless quality. From sharply tailored vegan leather coats to draped dresses in eye-catching hues, she consistently offers styles that are easy to wear, but also have clear elements of panache. It’s no wonder why the brand in so beloved on Instagram. Still, this didn’t mean that it was turning a profit.  </p>
      <p>On the surface, fashion is a creative industry based on pushing forward an ideal, often glamorous image. But scratch away the first coat, and it is essentially a business based on low margins, high spending, and competition in a marketplace that has become so overly saturated that even the best labels have closed up shop. Understanding these basic principles is Peter Baldaszti, a Hungarian entrepreneur who saw the potential in making Nanushka a global fashion brand. </p>

      <p>He was dating Sandor three years prior to taking on the role of CEO and co-owner in 2016, the year that changed the course of the company. What he did to overhaul Nansushka and astoundingly increase revenue, to be sure, isn’t groundbreaking in the least. He simply had the foresight to see that it could really impact the global market. And after instituting a solid operating system—and with a little bit of luck—the brand is now a palatable enterprise.   </p>
      <p>Ahead of Nansushka’s New York store opening,  Baldaszti served up his recipe for making Nanushka relatively successful. </p>

        <b>Barry Samaha: The brand was founded in 2006, but why didn’t it take off until 2016?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Peter Baldaszti: </b>Sandra has been developing this brand for almost a decade without any business acumen. She is creative. Until 2016, it was very much under the radar. When I joined at the end of 2016 as co-owner and CEO, it was still a small company. I brought in an institutional investor.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Who was funding the business before then?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>It was all friends and family. She also had a smaller investor, but it wasn’t really impactful. Sandra and I have been a couple for six years now. When I joined, we had been together for three years. We already had experience with each other, and I knew what I was taking on. I thought that I could bring a more entrepreneurial mindset to the table, which was really missing in the company setup. Before the investor, JB Partners, and I joined, the company took a very different approach.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: What was the approach?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>It wasn’t global. If you live in the United States, it might be hard to understand how entrepreneurs in Central Europe think. Usually, one of their biggest mistakes is that they forget that they could build a global business. Today, you can build one from anywhere in the world. This was one of the main reasons why Nanushka wasn’t able to really make an impact. Sandra is absolutely a talented designer. She’s amazing. But thinking about a business takes a different approach. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: So, what are you are bringing to the table that is helping the business grow?     </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>We completely changed the business. Previously, Nanushka had very few global stockists, and had an exclusive agreement with a global distributor. When I came in, the first thing I did was part with the distributor and build our own internal sales team to push wholesale. We started working with selected, locally-specialized agencies and showrooms that represent the brand in certain territories and markets. We began to rebuild the wholesale business because this is the most obvious channel for growth in terms of volume, brand awareness, and revenue. </p>
      <p>Then, we started building a proper branding and communications department with a global network of PR agencies in markets where we saw the biggest opportunities to grow the brand. Before 2016, we had very limited data that we could use to make decisions on the online presence of Nanushka and social media. But what we did see is that we had lots of opportunities in the United States. We are looking at this market more strategically, finding the right showroom and PR partnerships; building out the right network.</p>

      <p><b>Samaha: Was Nanushka</b> <b>sold in the U.S. prior to you joining?</b></p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>Yes, in three to four small doors; mainly specialty boutiques.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Did you see continued growth at these doors?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>Not in terms of volume, but in terms of brand awareness. We did have a following in the U.S., and looking at Nanushka and what the product is, we saw that it was the right fit for the New York market, for the Los Angeles market, for big cities. This is why we first wanted to build out the wholesale business, and our own e-commerce department. Then we opened our first store in Budapest. It was sort of a laboratory for us to work on potentially expanding internationally. And the Budapest store, luckily, has been profitable since day one. It has proven to be a good decision. From there, we started to focus on [selling] direct to consumer so as to have three revenue channels. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: What was the overall revenue?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>In 2016, the revenue was about $1 million. It’s not bad for a small brand, but the company had lost a significant amount. That is the gross income. There were no profits. The company was losing $600,000 that year. It was definitely a hard situation to turn around. By 2017, we managed to grow the business to $2.5 million, but it was still losing money. Then, by 2018, the company has made more than $9 million. So, from November 2016 to the end of 2018, we grew the business tenfold. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: And this was just by expanding your wholesale accounts?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>Yes, and also our direct-to-consumer business. </p>
      <p><b>Samaha: Does Nanushka</b> <b>have an international presence online?</b></p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>Yes, we are fully global. In fact, 35% of our online revenue is from the U.S. And 20% of our entire revenue in 2019 is from e-commerce. 5% is from the Budapest store. 75% is from wholesale. This year we calculate that the revenue will be about $25 million. In less than three years, the business has grown 25 times. It’s been a ride. We managed to break even in the middle of 2018, which was very important. I really don’t believe in financing a loss-making operation for the sake of growth. Especially in this current start-up climate, most times profitability is not part of the equation. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: How many years did you give yourself to turn a profit?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>It wasn’t much—basically a year and a half. It would have been impossible to focus on long-term strategies and goals when you’re focusing on fundraising all the time. Fundraising takes away all the attention on building a business. Actually, we could grow more if we are willing to raise more capital. But we instead focused on being profitable. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Samaha: So, why did you decide to open a store in New York? You’re a European brand. Wouldn’t it make sense to open your second store in London or Paris and build from there?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>It’s going to happen. We’re opening in New York now, and then in London at the end of March; LA at the end of June, and Paris at the end of September. That’s the plan for next year. We are starting in New York because, based on the data we possess, it is our strongest market. It is also the strongest city in the world. If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere. That’s part of the equation. It is the hardest to crack. From a strategic and positioning perspective, it felt like the right decision. </p>
      <p>In the fast-changing retail landscape, if you can make an impact with the current market conditions, you can have good deals. I found that we could make better deals here, and find the right property than, say, in Paris. That’s why it is our last destination. The Paris real estate landscape is much more challenging. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Where is the location of your New York store, and why did you think it was the most ideal choice?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>We chose Wooster Street. I’ve been scouting locations for six months, and I found that the traditional parts of SoHo, like Mercer and Greene Street, were too obvious. I liked Wooster—especially between Prince and Houston Street, with its cobblestones—because it felt, in a way, European. And that fits the brand well. It is laidback. It’s a bit residential and not too commercial. We just fell in love with it. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Did you consider the foot traffic?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>It’s important, but it’s not everything. It’s not about more people entering the store, but the right people entering the store. This is why we felt strongly about the Wooster Street location. We’re right next to the Mansur Gavriel flagship, and I think both stores will strengthen each other. I feel that there is a good synergy on Wooster Street. We’ll also have a cafe on the corner of the store, so I think that will help integrate Nanushka into the neighborhood. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Is this experiential component important for the brand? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>We are designing the store to reflect Sandra’s and my apartment. This is why there’ll be a corner where you can sit down and read a book or newspaper with a cup of coffee. We want people to spend time in the store without the pressure to buy something. It will also serve as a gallery for our own content. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Samaha: What kind of content?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>We are launching a biannual print magazine that is travel-themed. But not in the way that other magazines deal with travel. We select a location, and go there for a week or two with a photographer. For our first, we went to Croatia with Jeremy Everett, who is super talented, and dedicated the entire issue to his work. Through a singular lens, we explore a location. And we will use the magazine imagery, which is about the destination, and put it in the store as an exhibition. So, for a couple of months, you are able to buy a photographer’s work. And we plan on donating all the revenue to a social or environmental cause. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Why not keep the profits?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>Sustainability and social responsibility is strongly rooted in the brand. Fashion impacts the environment greatly, and we need to give back when we can. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: With so many stores closing up locations—Barney’s being the prime example—do you think it is wise to open a series of boutique throughout the globe?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>I don’t think brick-and-mortar is dead. Bad brick-and-mortar is dead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: So how are you good? Why do you think you’ll succeed where others have faltered? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>First, we are awake. I think many brands in the last decade failed to realize that retail is always changing. We are a customer-driven business. I think when you offer an amazing customer experience; you don’t have to reinvent yourself. Having a great experience in a store goes a long way. I feel like with the right service, and the right products, it could be profitable. And if you add certain exciting elements, and differentiate your store with these experiential components, it will be even more successful. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Samaha: Don’t you think others have followed that equation and still have closed down? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Baldaszti: </b>Maybe they were not lucky. I think you also need a certain amount of luck to build a successful business.  </p>
