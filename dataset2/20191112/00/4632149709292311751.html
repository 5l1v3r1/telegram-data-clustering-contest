      <p><i>Lack of a proper parking space within compound is forcing visitors to park their vehicles in lanes of residential areas </i><br/><br/>Kala Bhavan, a space for cultural activities, was inaugurated on November 8 by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) at NR Colony in Basavanagudi. But the residents are far from pleased to have a cultural centre in their midst. They worry that the lack of parking in the building can create traffic problems in the neighbourhood. Built at a cost of Rs 2.6 crore by the civic authority, the building’s parking for the 170-seater auditorium, is falling woefully short, say the residents. <br/><br/>To get to the building, one needs to enter through the main gate of the compound that also accommodates offices of Bangalore One, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) and a BBMP hospital. Two staircases which go up to the first floor, where the stage is situated, are at the rear of the building. <br/><br/>The ground-plus-one auditorium has been named after renowned Kannada music composer C Ashwath. <br/><br/>According to the Karnataka Municipalities Model Building Bye-laws 2017, parking space means an area enclosed or unenclosed, covered or open, sufficient in size to park vehicles together with a driveway connecting the parking space to a public street or any public area and permitting the ingress and egress of the vehicles. However, the 175-seater auditorium has covered space for 20 two wheelers only. Kala Bhavan shares its parking space with other offices in the premises.</p>
      <p>It is a nuisance for the residents. Both sides of the roads are already occupied due to illegal encroachments. The Rama Mandira in the area already has an auditorium, then why do we need another</p>
      <p>– V T Chandrashekhar, resident<br/><br/><br/>At least one primary entrance to each building shall be usable by individuals in wheelchairs and shall be indicated by a sign. The entrance gate shall fold back against the compound wall of the premises, thus leaving the exterior access way within the plot free for movement of fire service vehicles. <br/><br/>Provisions for parking of vehicles of differently-abled people should be provided as per the National Building Code (NBC) 2016. At Kala Bhavan, there is no adequate space for the fire service vehicles to enter in case there is an emergency and no provisions for differently-abled people to park their vehicles. There is no display of information at the parking area of the auditorium stating that the space is reserved for the parking of wheelchair users. <br/><br/>Also, there are no ramps or access paths to the building for them. <br/><br/>Residents around the area have complained that the lack of adequate parking will only add to the existing parking issues. Anand, a resident of the area is worried about the traffic congestion this would create in the area in future. “There is no space to accommodate so many vehicles. The ground floor has health and ward offices and so, the parking space is mostly occupied by the officials themselves. The auditorium also hosts several school functions and many come to attend them in cars. Owing to lack of space inside the auditorium’s premises, they are forced to park in the lanes of the residential areas,” he said. <br/>There are five hotels, three temples, bus terminals, two choultries and vegetable vendors apart from the BESCOM and Bangalore One office and a BBMP hospital on the same stretch. Out on the main road, tempo travellers have a designated parking spot. <br/><br/>Residents say they have no hope from the elected representatives. V T Chandrashekhar, a resident, says, “It is a great nuisance for the residents here. Both sides of the roads are already occupied due to illegal encroachments and parking of vehicles. The Rama Mandira in the area already has an auditorium, then why do we need another?” <br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, B S Satyanarayana, corporator of Basavanagudi, has denied that there are parking issues. He said, “It’s a beautiful auditorium with an ample parking facility. All the offices on the compound are closed in the evenings. So we can accommodate about 200 vehicles. Our programmes take place only in the evenings. So, there is no issue.”</p>
