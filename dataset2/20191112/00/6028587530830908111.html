      <p>It’s easy for Abigail Disney, a self-described “woke” Disney princess, to climb upon her platform and issue a finger-wagging to fellow boomers. While her lashing may have been well-intentioned, the Disney heiress’ rebuke to boomers only amplifies her personal ageist issues and adds fuel to an angry fire burning across the generations. Disney’s <a href="https://twitter.com/abigaildisney/status/1193659964503547909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext%252Fhtml%26key%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935%26schema%3Dtwitter%26url%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fabigaildisney%2Fstatus%2F1193659964503547909%26image%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage%253Furl%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fpbs.twimg.com%25252Fprofile_images%25252F1193945409737105409%25252FVOvviELE_400x400.jpg%2526key%253D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935">November 10 Tweet</a>, a thread of five statements, has drawn both praise and criticism. No matter which side readers take, her message further divides the generations. By pitting one against the other and blaming an entire generation for the world’s woes, Disney offers nothing to ease the tensions. And, while she begins her discourse with, “What the hell is wrong with you/us boomers?” she immediately drops the “us” and proceeds to lecture her generational peers with an ageist vengeance.</p>
      <p>While one can assume Disney is speaking directly to those boomers who find the “OK, Boomer” vernacular insulting, she still manages to cave in to the false stereotypes that contribute to the generational divide.</p>
      <p>Ten statements from Disney’s thread demonstrating her ageist bias:</p>
      <p>1) “Face up to the fact that the world is changing fast but you are not.”</p>
      <p>How can Disney arrogantly suggest that anyone opposed to the “OK, Boomer” phrase is in a state of arrested development?</p>
      <p>2) “You are not irrelevant yet. But you are less relevant every day.”</p>
      <p>What makes Disney believe that getting older correlates with decreasing relevance?</p>
      <p>3) “And the more often you object to Millennials' understandable resentment toward a generation that has selfishly poisoned their water, blown past every climate warning so they could drive their stupid hummers, and looked away or worse for....Sexual, racial and economic injustice, the more you prove their point that you just don't understand anything of value to them.”</p>
      <p>How can Disney stereotype 76 million Americans as selfish and deliberate destroyers of ecology, and responsible for social, racial and economic injustice?</p>
      <p>4) “Oh, and does anyone remember not trusting anyone over 30??? Good lord I bet half of the nudniks complaining about youth disrespecting them were all over that freight train of prejudice and bad judgment.”</p>
      <p>Does anyone else see the hypocrisy of disrespect and judgment?</p>
      <p>5) “How about you guys sit the f@*k down and let the kids drive.”</p>
      <p>Does Disney plan to sit down and let the kids drive?</p>
      <p>6) “It's not like you've done such a great job with the time you have had.”</p>
      <p>Where is the statistical evidence to support this biased claim?</p>
      <p>7) “Get over the idea that all things pass, you are old and you need to let history do what history does: move on.”</p>
      <p>Does Disney realize that she’s just labeled herself and directed herself to step aside?</p>
      <h3>The Language of Bias Hurts Everyone</h3>
      <p>There is no argument that the phrase, “OK, Boomer,” is intended to be rude and dismissive. It’s also a way for younger people to show frustration at anyone older than themselves. But the phrase is an addition to age-biased language that perpetuates an already ageist society.</p>
      <p>And it goes both ways. Boomers have long referenced Millennials as lazy and entitled, just as the Matures generation labeled their boomer offspring. Name-calling never solves any problems, so why does it prevail?</p>
      <p>It could be argued that ageist language is becoming more prominent than ever before, and the impact is taking a toll on organizational innovation and overall team success. In her article, “<a href="https://www.ehstoday.com/safety/ehs_imp_79675">Ageist Language Affects Workplace Productivity, Profits</a>” Laura Walter writes that in an analysis of age-discrimination lawsuits, using even subtle ageist language with older workers negatively impacts employee productivity and company profits.</p>
      <p>The courts are increasingly filled with filings citing agist language that creates an inequitable or hostile environment work environment. Last year, a California woman was <a href="https://apnews.com/2823071eda8e4aa69a3be4b58e421978">awarded $31 million</a>, based on her lawsuit that alleged her boss told her, "you are outdated," "we need younger workers here" and "dumb female.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Answer Is Here</b>
      </p>
      <p>Disney’s pompous tirade overgeneralizes the issues and espouses that boomers have little to contribute to the world. Worse, it offers no solution for the root cause of the problem: inability to effectively communicate (and that goes both ways). Wake up, Princess!</p>
      <p>In his article, “<a href="https://nationswell.com/ageism-problem-america/">I’m Ageist. Here’s Why That’s A Problem</a>,” Millennial Joseph Darius Jaafari writes about a chance encounter with a boomer at the checkout line. He candidly admits his biases about the older generation and then humbly admits why he’s all wrong. Best of all, he shares his understanding of what perpetuates ageism and what we can do to change it.</p>
      <p>Even the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/opinions/ok-boomer-callan-filipovic/index.html">contentious dialogue</a> between the feminist lawyer and author Jill Filipovic and CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Paul Callan ends with agreement that ageist language is destructive. Which goes to show that a conversation about the issues–even when controversial–can also be constructive.</p>
      <p>Callan’s final comment in the debates, “The flippant "OK Boomer" insult eliminates the need to have a respectful and reasoned discussion about the solutions to the problems of contemporary America.”</p>
      <p>Filipvic closes with, “And that the "generational warfare" frame makes us talk past each other and puts us all on the defensive.”</p>
      <p>They are both right.</p>
