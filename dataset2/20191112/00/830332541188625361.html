      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The Wisconsin agriculture secretary fired by the Republican-controlled state Senate has a new job, still within Gov. Tony Evers' administration.</p>
      <p>Brad Pfaff has been hired as the director of business and rural development for the state Department of Administration. The announcement Monday comes less than a week after his confirmation as agriculture secretary was rejected. Republicans were upset with comments he made critical of them not quickly releasing funding for farmer mental health services.</p>
      <p>In his new job, Plaff will be paid $120,910. The position is new and will have expanded responsibilities compared with the previous director of business development, whose salary was $86,736.</p>
      <p>The statement announcing his hiring says his experience supporting and advocating for Wisconsin small businesses and rural communities will be used to help grow the state's economy.</p>
