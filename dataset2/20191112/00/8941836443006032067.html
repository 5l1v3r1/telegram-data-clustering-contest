        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>If we are to resolve and make inroads into the problem of homelessness we are going to have to deal with the root causes of that condition. The price of homes is not the cause of homelessness in this country. Mental illness and drug addiction are the principal root causes of homelessness, and until that is recognized and dealt with the problem will not be resolved.</p>
      <p>Society must deal with this problem in a straightforward, practical way. We must invest in health care and drug addiction facilities, as well as clinics for seriously affected people. We must provide living and hospital quarters.</p>
      <p>Unless society is willing to spend the money to fix the root causes of homelessness, this tragic condition will not be remedied anytime soon.</p>
