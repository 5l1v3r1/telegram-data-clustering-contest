      <p>Award-winning chef David Burke is hosting monthly food and wine events dubbed Chef’s Studio at his eatery, <a href="https://davidburketavern.com/">David Burke Tavern</a>, to showcase an experimental menu while highlighting a featured winemaker.Burke says the menu typically consists of items that aren’t regularly available at the restaurant, such as luxury items and certain cuts of meat. “These dinners are also a great time for our younger chefs to explore and learn techniques that they don’t regularly get the chance to practice,” he adds.</p>
      <p>The dinners take place in his Chef Studio, which is located on the second floor of the restaurant, and the space can accommodate up to 20 guests. Burke says he works with his corporate chef, Carmine DiGiovanni, to curate a menu that will pair well with the wines and uses seasonal ingredients. Burke adds that one of his favorite dishes he made for the monthly event was sea scallops in a shell with fennel, blood orange and jalapeño, which was paired with Oyster Bay’s 2018 Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand. Another notable dish created for the Chef’s Studio event was dry aged duck, duck and foie dumplings with charred and pickled plums paired with a 2017 Mer Soleil Pinot Noir Reserve from Santa Lucia Highlands, Calif.</p>

      <p>“We want these dinners to serve as a new dining experience for New Yorkers where you leave with new friends, memorable conversations and you learn a thing or two from myself, the expert winemakers and sommeliers that are present,” Burke adds. “We also want attendees to enjoy the restaurant’s vibe and hospitality, so that we gain more loyal customers.”</p>
      <p>Burke originally opened David Burke Tavern in Manhattan’s Upper East Side in 1992, and it’s one of his many restaurant ventures. “For Tavern, I wanted to create a restaurant where I could showcase my take on modern American cuisine while still incorporating some of my signature dishes such as the angry lobster dumplings with spicy tomato and ‘clothesline’ candied bacon,” he says. “It is a collection of ideas from the past, present and future that we incorporate to stay within certain guidelines of what we think people want to eat these days, adding in a dose of creativity, whimsy and seasonality that stays in line with the presentations I’m known for.” Guests can also order steaks at the eatery that are made with Burke’s patented dry-aging technique. The food menu is matched with a curated wine list, a specially cocktail program and craft beers.</p>

      <p>The establishment features a whimsical décor that Burke says he was inspired by old world taverns such as 21 Club or PJ Clarke’s. He says he took that inspiration and combined it with the elegant atmosphere of the Upper East Side. On the walls hang several pieces of art from Burke’s personal collection, with many of them being by Marc Chagall. “I wanted to create a cozy ambiance that is a blend between a classic New York townhome and American tavern that patrons enjoy coming back to,” Burke says.</p>
