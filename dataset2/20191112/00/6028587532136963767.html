      <p>Elite watchmaker Vacheron Constantin is partnering with the Louvre Museum in Paris to collaborate on future watchmaking co-creations and restorations. Vacheron teamed up with the Louvre two years ago to restore an exceptional 18<sup>th</sup> century astronomical clock, La Création du Monde, which is now displayed at the Louvre. The vintage clock was originally intended to serve as a diplomatic gift, but instead was presented to King Louis XV, in 1754. It later served as a clock aboard a ship in the French navy for two years, where it sustained substantial damage. The clock was repaired by various watchmakers over the next 10 years, but was never fully functional again. It ended up in the national museum of Versailles and eventually, the Louvre. Vacheron Constantin restored the clock to full working order, a task that began in 2016 and lasted three years, involving rebuilding the lunar cycle mechanism, the hours and equation of time hands and the winding system of the earth's rotation mechanism.</p>

      <p>Apparently, Vacheron is now ready for more. “These three years of restoration work not only brought up various mechanisms and complications required to ensure its smooth operation back to standards, but also made it possible to conduct researchon the history of this clock and the watchmaking of the era,” says Vacheron’s global marketing chief Laurent Perves. Although Vacheron did not release details about upcoming works in partnership with the Louvre, Perves did not rule out the possibility of creating a watch as part of the collaboration. “If you know Vacheron Constantin, and more particularly our Metiers d’Art collection, you can expect exciting news in the upcoming months and years,” he says. “This partnership will allow us to exchange knowledge and techniques and develop creative collaborations in various projects, including the creation of exclusive timepieces.”</p>

      <p>“Vacheron Constantin has long stood out in terms of both artistic commitment and cultural patronage,” says Louis Ferla, CEO of Vacheron Constantin. “With the Louvre, we are beginning a very promising new chapter. Future projects will include collaborations inspired by the collections of the Louvre.”  Vacheron Constantin is the world’s oldest watch company in continuous production.</p>
