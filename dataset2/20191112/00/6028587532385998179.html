      <p>Disney Plus is finally here, and as exciting as all those old vaulted movies may be, I’ve been most looking forward to <i>The Mandalorian.</i>For the first time ever, <i>Star Wars </i>has a live-action TV show, and the Season 1 premiere did not disappoint. It’s a space western with some <i>Firefly </i>vibes and it feels very much in keeping with classic <i>Star Wars.</i></p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian’s </i>season premiere mostly takes place in seedy dives like the cantina from <i>A New Hope </i>or Jabba the Hutt’s palace from <i>Return of the Jedi. </i>This is a show about the darker underbelly of the <i>Star Wars </i>universe–the seedier, grittier<i> Star Wars, </i>with less of the good vs evil and more of shades of grey.</p>
      <p>I’ll write some non-spoilery impressions out first, and then get into the recap/spoilery-review.</p>
      <p>First things first, <i>The Mandalorian’s </i>opening foray is surprisingly short: Just 39 minutes. That’s three minutes shorter than your typical 1 hour TV spot after accounting for commercials. I’m not sure if the rest of the episodes will follow suite, or if they’ll have varied times. I suspect the latter since there’s no reason to have the same length episode on a streaming service like Disney+.</p>
      <p>39 minutes is short, but the premiere moves–for the most part–at a slow pace. Moments of action are largely cocooned between more plodding sections, though I never found any of it boring or overly slow. In fact, one of my biggest complaints with the <i>Star Wars </i>films these days is that they all move along much too quickly. The original trilogy was never shy about taking its time, and each of the first three films divided into roughly three locations.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In <i>A New Hope </i>we tarried for quite some time on Tatooine before another long segment on the Death Star, followed by a finale largely consisting of the assault on said Death Star. Minus a few brief scenes elsewhere, these were the only significant locations in the film.</p>
      <p>In <i>The Empire Strikes Back, </i>the movie was divided between the opening segment on Hoth, Luke’s visit to Degobah and–after a short trip into a space worm’s gullet–Cloud City.</p>
      <p>And in <i>The Return Of The Jedi, </i>Tatooine returns as our long opening location followed by a return to Degobah and then a long segment on Endor. Each film was largely broken up between three primary locations, with some of those locations revisited in the final film.</p>
      <p>In virtually every <i>Star Wars </i>film since, we’ve hopped planets much too quickly. Even the mostly wonderful <i>Rogue One </i>zips between far too many locations.</p>
      <p>And I suppose <i>The Mandalorian </i>has its fair share as well, but at least it allows for some slower moments, some visual world-building that brings us right back into the colorful, quirky and dangerous <i>Star Wars </i>universe. It’s filled with strange aliens and familiar creatures from the original trilogy. It feels very <i>Star Wars </i>from start to finish, and it doesn’t try to be much of anything else, while still offering up an intriguing and surprisingly important story.</p>
      <p>Coupled with a lovely score from <i>Black Panther</i> composer Ludwig Göransson, <i>The Mandalorian </i>feels every bit the vintage <i>Star Wars </i>that we were hoping for, and I’m incredibly excited for Episode 2 which lands this Friday. That’s not very long to wait!</p>

        <i>Okay, now on to the spoilers . . . .</i>
      </p>
      <h3>A bounty hunter walks into a bar.</h3>
      <p>It’s a bar on an ice planet, but it’s not so different from the cantina that Luke and Obi-Wan Kenobi found themselves in, just before meeting Han Solo. And the bounty hunter’s welcome is just about as pleasant.</p>
      <p>Two seedy characters have a blue alien pinned to a table, and when the titular Mandalorian (Pedro Pescal) walks in, one of their drinks spills. This makes the bald-headed man angry, and he approaches our protagonist with blood in his eyes.</p>
      <p>A fight ensues in which it’s firmly established just how much of a badass the titular Mandalorian is. He chops one of the aliens in half with the cantina door. Pretty violent for a TV-PG outing.</p>
      <p>The blue alien (Horatio Sanz) thanks our hero, but his relief is short-lived. The Mandalorian puts a bounty puck down on the table and a holographic image of the alien pops up. He’s the mark, and soon he’s in the Mandalorian’s custody. They take a speeder out to his ship–it looks like it could be Luke’s from Episode IV, though much worse for wear.</p>
      <p>They speed out to the bounty hunter’s ship, and when they get there, the driver tells them to stay off the ice. He drives off and moments later a giant dragon-like creature bursts through the ice and swallows up his speeder.</p>
      <p>The dragon turns his attention to the Mandalorian’s ship and the two barely escape with their lives. The Bounty, as he’s officially described, is essentially the Mandalorian’s polar opposite. He never shuts up. He offers him money. He wanders around the ship, where he finds several other of the Mandalorian’s marks, all frozen in carbonite.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When he turns around, the bounty hunter is standing there. He puts him on ice, and the alien finally shuts up.</p>
      <p>I’ll be honest, this opening segment was probably the weakest of the episode. It was comic relief before we needed comic relief, in a show that’s not really supposed to be funny. That’s exactly the kind of show you need comic relief in, but the <i>relief </i>part suggests it comes after some more serious segments. This came too soon.</p>
      <p>Not to worry. The Mandalorian drops his cargo with this guy:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dcb3a7fea103f00065246b1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Carl Weathers as Greef Carga<cite>Credit: LucasFilm / Disney</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is Greef Carga, who’s in the business of giving out bounties to bounty hunters. He’s also in the business of stiffing them for their hard work, but at least he sets the Mandalorian up with a new–somewhat mysterious–job.</p>
      <p>The Mandalorian heads out to meet his new client. He finds him in a room with four Stormtroopers–an odd set of bodyguards considering the Empire has fallen. Listed as simply The Client (Werner Herzog), he sets our hero off on a cryptic mission. They can’t give him a bounty puck or much information at all, beyond a tracker and the bounty’s age: He’s apparently 50 years old, and while they’d prefer him captured alive, proof of death will suffice.</p>
      <p>So The Mandalorian sets out once again, making his way to the planet where the bounty is apparently hiding out. It’s a desert planet, and he’s almost immediately set upon by giant, hulking two-legged creatures called blurggs.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He’s saved in the nick of time by Kuill (Nick Nolte) a familiar-looking alien who shows up riding one of the beasts, and then later teaches the Mandalorian to ride one. I really like Nolte’s character, though I doubt we’ll see him again. At least not any time soon.</p>
      <p>Familiarity is one bell that keeps ringing throughout the episode, but not quite in the same way as <i>The Force Awakens. </i>That film copied the very large brushstrokes of <i>A New Hope, </i>and while I liked it a great deal it was undoubtedly taking nostalgia and familiarity a little far–especially with Starkiller Base.</p>
      <p>In <i>The Mandalorian, the </i>familiar is more of an aesthetic. The titular character looks just like Boba Fett, thanks to them both hailing from the same “tribe” (a term we hear when The Mandalorian visits The Armorer (Emily Swallow) and planet of Mandalore. The Mandalorian is a foundling, however. I’m not sure whether Boba Fett was.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>(Notice, many of these characters–just like the Mandalorian himself–are only referred to by their role or profession: The Client, The Bounty, The Armorer, etc.)</p>
      <p>Familiarity extends to the world-building, with this very familiar little critter being cooked over a spit while another looks on from his cage:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dcb3ca92c886a0007ebfd84/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>The Dinner<cite>Credit: LucasFilm / Disney</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But that’s the extent of <i>The Mandalorian’s </i>foray into nostalgia. This is a show that, at least after its season premiere, seems intent on doing something new, while tipping its helmet to what’s come before. Not only that, it promises to vastly expand the universe and what we know about <i>Star Wars </i>lore in ways that I think are, so far at least, enormously satisfying.</p>
      <p>The Mandalorian and Kuill head out to where this mysterious bounty is holed up. He’s in some kind of compound in the middle of the desert, protected by a large faction of well-armed aliens. The whole “learn to ride” segment, followed by the two of them galloping out into the desert, sweeping orchestral horns blaring, is all distinctly Western. You can’t watch <i>The Mandalorian </i>any other way. Stylistically, this is a Western space opera.</p>
      <p>The final gunfight is terrific, and feels like something out of <i>The Magnificent Seven </i>or <i>The Sons Of Katie Elder</i>. Just as the Mandalorian is devising his plan, a bounty droid shows up. This is IG-11 (Taika Waititi) and my only complaint is that he dies much too soon. Maybe he’ll be back at some point also. (It’s hard to say–so many of the actors on IMDB are only billed one episode, but that doesn’t mean they’ll only appear in one. It could just be that they’re keeping us on our toes.)</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s not only a great action scene, it’s filled with great moments of comic relief–and this time, they’re well placed. IG-11 keeps threatening to self-destruct every time the odds seem against them. His protocol forbids him from being captured, and whenever things look too grim, he starts the self-destruct protocol.</p>
      <p>The Mandalorian keeps hollering at him to stop from setting off his thermal detonator (which is another small fragment of familiarity–you may recall Leia’s similar threats in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>). It’s the first time we see our titular bounty hunter lose his cool, and it’s at once charming and funny.</p>
      <p>In the end, the bounty hunters prevail, leaving a swath of bodies in their wake. Their target is beyond a heavy set of doors which they blast through. They come to a small, hovering sphere that turns out to be a cradle.</p>
      <p>“Wait,” the Mandalorian says. “They said fifty years old.”</p>
      <p>“Species age differently,” the droid replies. “Perhaps it could live many centuries. Sadly, we’ll never know.”</p>
      <p>And this is when we see who the mysterious bounty is–and finally understand why no screeners were sent out to critics ahead of the November 12th launch of Disney+:</p>
      <p>To avoid spoilers for a genuine <i>“Oh my god!”</i> moment.</p>
      <p>Also: <i>How cute is this???</i></p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>A baby yoda!!!<cite>Credit: LucasFilm / Disney</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>IG-11 raises his blaster and we hear a shot go off, wince, see the droid fall to the floor with a blaster hole in the head. The Mandalorian, far from showing up to take out a mark, shows up just in time to save a baby Yoda.</p>
      <p>Well, not Yoda, but a creature from the same species as the long-lived Jedi Master. We’ve only ever seen one of Yoda’s species, and I think they must be very rare–and very precious.</p>
      <p>This is a pretty huge moment. Frankly, it’s one of the biggest, coolest moments in any of the new <i>Star Wars </i>films/shows. It’s kind of a big deal.</p>
      <p>There’s a price on this baby’s head, and some factions associated with the fallen Empire want to capture it–perhaps, in the case of Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi) to research its inherent Force abilities–perhaps to harness them for the vestiges of the Empire.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, I think we’ve found our McGuffin.</p>
      <p>I do believe that a moment like this is what so many people were waiting for, and never found, in <i>The Last Jedi. </i>Revelation and surprise and a connecting of dots.<i> A</i>nd I can see why so many people were upset when they didn’t get any of those things(even if I don’t agree with many of the complaints surrounding that movie).</p>
      <p>This kind of epic reveal is exactly what has always made <i>Star Wars </i>such great fun. It’s a “Luke, I am your father” kind of moment (though perhaps not quite so earth-shattering) and I love it.</p>
      <h3>Verdict</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>All told, I really enjoyed this episode. It’s a solid season premiere, introducing us to the Mandalorian and to the world(s) he inhabits, and sparking off a much bigger, more epic story than I ever expected from this show. We’re getting a rougher, wilder <i>Star Wars </i>in the bargain, much like <i>Rogue One, </i>and that makes me very happy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it’s every bit as big budget as the movies and, so far at least, boasts a more original plot. Whether that will hold up in the seven remaining episodes in Season 1 remains to be seen, but I have very high hopes.</p>
      <p>I’ve heard some grumblings out there–because this is Star Wars so of course!–but I think <i>The Mandalorian</i> might end up being a mostly well-received TV show by both casual and super-fans and everyone in-between and along the margins, which is a nice change from all the controversy surrounding <i>Star Wars </i>lately. I’m pretty tired of the debate constantly buzzing about the peripheral of these films, which far too often dovetails into shouting matches about Mary Sues and SJWs, and I hope this show will remain focused on great storytelling and world-building, and the conversation around it will be about the content rather than the meta-politics.</p>
      <p>Maybe I’m an optimist. I guess we’ll see. But so far, I’m absolutely loving <i>The Mandalorian. </i>It blends two of my favorite things–Star Wars and Western movies–into one incredible drama, and we’re only one episode deep. If the show continues to pick up steam and raise the stakes, I think we’re in for a real treat.</p>
      <p>It was great. I have spoken.</p>
