      <h1>Realtors Are Trying to Sell a Decommissioned Nuclear Missile Silo</h1>

      <h3>Planning Ahead</h3>
      <p>Not trying to be a downer, but humanity’s future on Earth <a href="https://futurism.com/scientists-human-extinction-likely">isn’t looking so bright</a>.</p>
      <p>Between the threats of <a href="https://futurism.com/tips-climate-change-ipcc">climate change</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/video-horrifying-devastation-us-russia-nuclear-war">nuclear warfare</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/08/world-faces-antibiotic-apocalypse-says-chief-medical-officer">antibiotic resistance</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/biological-weapons-department-of-defense">biological weapons</a>, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-asteroid-hit-earth">incoming asteroids,</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/relatively-easy-killer-robots-2021">killer robots</a>, civilization could <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/doomsday-clock-two-minutes-midnight">seemingly collapse</a> at any moment — and if or when it does, you’re really going to wish you bought this decommissioned nuclear missile silo in Arizona.</p>
      <h3>Fixer Upper</h3>
      <p>From 1963 through the early 1980s, the United States operated <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/tucson-in-objects-missile-silos-brought-cold-war-to-tucson/article_2a5ba77b-446e-593c-a709-afa48a4d17ab.html">18 underground missile silos</a> near Tucson, Arizona, each containing a Titan 2 missile armed with a nine-megaton nuclear warhead.</p>
      <p>After the Cold War, the U.S. decommissioned the silos, selling several to private buyers. In 2002, a man named Rick Ellis bought one of the silos for $200,000, a new <i>Arizona Daily Star</i> <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/not-ready-to-launch-missile-silo-for-sale-is-handyman/article_06a15060-ec0c-52e2-ba70-4e404b1b74e8.html#22">story</a> claims.</p>
      <p>On Friday, he put it <a href="https://www.estately.com/listings/info/24665-s-highway-79--3">back on the market</a> with an asking price of $395,000 — but the silo isn’t exactly move-in-ready. Currently, the only way to enter it is by climbing down a <a href="https://images.estately.net/43_21928852_24_1573405853.jpg">40-foot-long extension ladder,</a> and some of the interior walls are covered in <a href="https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/tucson.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/a6/4a6be1cb-cda0-5b39-846f-85031f788d79/5dc5ecf27162a.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C785">peeling lead paint</a>.</p>
      <h3>Underground Scene</h3>
      <p>Even if you can afford to buy Ellis’s missile silo and make it into your dream doomsday bunker, though, you’ll need to convince him your plans for it are worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Ellis told the <i>Arizona Daily Star </i>he’s already rejected two offers, one from someone who wanted to use the silo as an underground medical marijuana greenhouse and the other from someone who envisioned it as a post-apocalyptic porn studio.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want that,” he told the newspaper.</p>
