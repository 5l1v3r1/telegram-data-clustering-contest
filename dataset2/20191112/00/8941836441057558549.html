      <p>DENVER (AP) - The federal Drug Enforcement Administration is seeking access to Colorado’s prescription information in a lawsuit sparking a dispute over privacy.</p>
      <p>The Colorado Sun reported Monday that the DEA’s lawsuit filed in federal court in Denver requests data from the State Board of Pharmacy’s database tracking opioid prescriptions.</p>
      <p>The data is maintained under the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.</p>
      <p>State officials have refused to provide the information, citing patient privacy concerns.</p>
      <p>The DEA lawsuit says the information is part of an investigation into whether two unnamed pharmacies broke the law in dispensing opioids and other drugs.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The agency previously issued administrative subpoenas to the pharmacy board for the information to link prescribing and dispensing practices.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit seeks a judge’s order enforcing the subpoenas.</p>
