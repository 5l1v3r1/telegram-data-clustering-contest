        <b>Starting next month, the US Air Force will begin a series of live communication experiments that hope to fix known data transfer issues between fleets by tapping tech experts both within and outside of the US Department of Defense.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Air Force Service Acquisition Executive Will Roper recently revealed that the service is just weeks away from branching outside of the Pentagon and embarking on its “connect-a-thon” series to improve communication between different aircraft.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re making it up as we go, right? There’s never been anything like this,” Roper admitted at a Defense Writers Group breakfast, as reported by <a href="https://www.c4isrnet.com/air/2019/11/12/us-air-force-to-link-f-35-with-f-22-in-connect-a-thon-experiment/">C4ISRNET</a>. “We need a way for people to propose connections and get into the pipeline. So I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it ends up being like a pitch day ... having a proposal process where we review the maturity of the tech versus the benefit to the war fighter. We would do the former, our operators would do the latter."</blockquote>
      <p>The communication between data link systems belonging to the F-22 Raptor and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910301077183997-pentagon-inks-contract-for-478-more-f-35s-at-cheapest-prices-yet/">F-35</a> Joint Strike Fighter will be the first hurdle faced during the invite-only, live experiments hosted by the North American Aerospace Defense Command and US Northern Command in December.</p>
      <p>Currently, the F-35’s Multifunction Advanced Data Link can receive information from the F-22 through Link 16, a decades-old system that has been the subject of controversy due to its hackability by enemy intelligence, according to <a href="http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2018/March%202018/The-F-22-and-the-F-35-Are-Struggling-to-Talk-to-Each-Other---And-to-the-Rest-of-USAF.aspx">Air Force Magazine</a>. However, the F-35 cannot share data with the F-22.</p>
      <blockquote>Roper also touched on this topic during the Air Force Association’s 2019 Air, Space &amp; Cyber Conference in September, noting that communication between the two aircraft is crucial for the service’s Multi-Domain Operations.</blockquote>
      <p>“What we are going to use is a Skyborg attritable drone, a cheap attritable aircraft, to link an F-22 and an F-35 that speak two different languages,” he said, reported <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2019/09/exclusive-air-force-to-upgrade-abms-every-4-months-roper/">Breaking Defense</a>. “We want to use the attritable drone to be the universal translator for both.”</p>
      <p>If the live experiments are successful, the proposed “translator,” dubbed GatewayOne, will be attached to a Valkyrie disposable drone - which has been developed within the service’s Skyborg program.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ve already heard thoughts from F-16, F-22, space programs — low Earth orbit programs — who say we can do this, we want to be part of the networked family,” Roper said in September.</blockquote>
      <p>Further efforts to make these connectivity dreams a reality appear to be on the horizon after <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911081077260983-us-air-force-tests-athena-laser-capable-of-neutralizing-multiple-drone-targets/">Air Force</a> Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein announced last week that not only does the service intend to make strides to ensure the F-22 and F-35 can transfer data between each other, but it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911111077283020-f-35-to-space-us-air-force-looks-to-connect-stealth-fighters-to-x-37b-spacecraft/">also hopes to link the fighter jets to the Boeing X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle</a>.</p>
