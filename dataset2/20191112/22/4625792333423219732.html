      <h1>Woman accused of trespassing at CIA to ‘speak with Agent Penis’ visited Obama home, judge says</h1>

      <p>The woman accused of trespassing at CIA headquarters and requesting to “speak with Agent Penis” also visited the home of former President Barack Obama, a federal judge said.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Court Judge John Anderson said he was informed that Jennifer Hernandez, 58, showed up at Obama’s house in Washington, D.C., after she was ordered to stay away from all government-related facilities, <a href="https://wtop.com/local/2019/11/judge-says-woman-arrested-in-cia-trespass-looking-for-agent-penis-later-visited-obama-home/">according to WTOP</a>.</p>
      <p>”I won’t go back there,” the North Carolina woman told the judge. “Tell me what to do, and I will abide by the law.”</p>
      <p>“You shouldn’t be going to places like the CIA and the Obamas’ house. You have to fight the callings, and you just can’t go back there,” Anderson said.</p>
      <p>Hernandez visited CIA headquarters four times between April and May, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/woman-charged-for-trespassing-after-trying-to-sneak-into-cia-by-asking-for-agent-penis">according to an affidavit</a>.</p>
      <p>On April 22, a CIA police officer encountered her at the vehicle entrance to CIA headquarters. She allegedly told the officer she had applied for CIA employment and a recruiter directed her to come to the agency. The officer told her she was trespassing and asked her to leave.</p>
      <p>Hernandez visited headquarters again on May 1, according to the affidavit, and said she was there to meet with her recruiter. A CIA police officer issued a written warning for trespassing and told Hernandez she could be arrested if she returned.</p>
      <p>Hernandez is alleged to have returned the next two days. On May 3, she requested “to speak with Agent Penis” and refused to leave the premises, the affidavit said.</p>
      <p>Whitney Minter, Hernandez’s public defender, said she and prosecutors are trying to resolve the case without a trial, but she is also considering a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to help you, not punish you,” Anderson told Hernandez. “The restraint the government is showing is unusual and appreciated.”</p>
