      <h1>Brexiteer MP Andrew Bridgen's 'bid to cut his wife's divorce settlement'</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE The MP is said to have asked to return to the business as director after legal proceedings with his ex-wife were finalised - to stop her claiming a larger divorce settlement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:16:47+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Sommerlad, Louie Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nick-sommerlad/, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has been accused of stepping aside from his family business in an attempt to stop his ex-wife claiming a larger divorce settlement.</p>
      <p>He allegedly viewed his involvement with the three companies as a “financial liability in his divorce”.</p>
      <p>Bridgen, 55, is said to have asked to return to the business as director after legal proceedings with his ex-wife Jackie were finalised.</p>
      <p>This request was rejected over allegations of his “extremely abusive and aggressive language and conduct”.</p>
      <p>All the claims, which Bridgen denies, are revealed in High Court files relating to a financial case he has brought against his brother Paul, 52, and other shareholders in the business.</p>

      <p>Brexiteer Bridgen, criticised last week for defending <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jacob-rees-mogg">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a> ’s comments on Grenfell, claims the group tried to extract profits from the business by “misappropriating” £1million in the “secret” purchase of Barn Farm in Hilton, Staffs, in 2015.</p>
      <p>He told the Mirror: “By taking two-thirds of my salary from me they dropped me in the deep and wide. I own 45% of the shares in all those companies... but I’ve got no control.”</p>

      <p>The firms, which boasted a £30million turnover, include Leicestershire-based AB Produce, which sells veg. The next hearing is Friday.</p>
      <p>Bridgen stopped taking an active role in the firms in 2010 after becom­­ing MP for North West Leicestershire. He separated from Jackie in 2011.</p>
      <p>Defence case papers filed by Paul and other shareholders claim Bridgen quit his “non-executive chairman” role because the MP was “concerned his wife would... seek increased financial relief [due to his] shareholdings and remaining directorship”.</p>

      <p>Paul and the shareholders, who deny wrongdoing, also allege Bridgen was aware of the farm purchase.</p>
      <p>Documents show Bridgen’s £90,000 company salary ended in August 2014. Bridgen, now married to opera singer Nevena, said his employment was terminated that month – weeks after the divorce hearing.</p>
