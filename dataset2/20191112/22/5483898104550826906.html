      <h3>Adelaide Crow Brad Crouch approached the Gold Coast Suns on the final weekend of the AFL trade period and “lowered his asking price”, according to a report.</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/revealed-crouch-s-late-pitch-to-join-gold-coast-20191112-p539z9.html">theage.com.au</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Initially, Crouch had asked for a six-year deal at just shy of $1 million per season.<br/><br/>The contract proposal went all the way to the Gold Coast board but was declined. The Suns were adamant they could not afford to spent that type of money on a player like Crouch, particularly as they would have to trade for him as well.<br/><br/>With the trade seemingly dead in the water, Crouch and his management made a last-ditch effort to re-ignite the move, lowering his asking price significantly, by hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br/><br/>But the deal didn’t go through.<br/><br/>It was too late in the piece and the Suns were unwilling to reveal Crouch’s trade request publicly, knowing that Adelaide would have demanded pick one or two in exchange.</blockquote>
