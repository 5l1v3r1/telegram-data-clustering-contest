      <p>​Officials have indicated that the fireball was likely the result of the Taurid meteor shower, which was at its peak late Monday. </p>
      <blockquote>"The Taurids are rich in fireballs, so if you see a Taurid it can be very brilliant and it'll knock your eyes out, but their rates absolutely suck," Bill Cooke, a NASA meteor expert, <a href="https://www.space.com/34587-taurid-meteor-shower-guide.html">told</a> Space.com. "It's simply the fact that when a Taurid appears it's usually big and bright."</blockquote>
