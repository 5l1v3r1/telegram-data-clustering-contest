      <p>The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu on Tuesday assured Nigerians that the police would exhibit professionalism during the November 16 governorship election in Kogi.</p>
      <p>Adamu stated this in Lokoja during a stakeholders meeting  in preparation for the election.</p>
      <p>He said that the police and other security agencies were fully prepared to ensure adequate security during the poll.</p>
      <p>The police chief said that the security agencies would ensure that all political parties were treated equally in the course of the exercise.</p>
      <p>He said that collation centres would be heavily fortified to avoid a disruption of the process.</p>
      <p>“On our part, the police and other security agencies are assuring people of the state that we will be professional in providing security during the election.</p>
      <p>“Polling units, materials and election officers will be given adequate security, we shall ensure that nobody is molested,” he said.</p>
      <p>The inspector general, however, cautioned the people against acts capable of derailing the electoral process, saying, “We will not tolerate anti-democracy attitudes”.</p>
      <p>According to him, the security agencies will rise up against politicians who indulge in vote buying during the election.</p>
      <p>“We shall not tolerate a situation where voting is ongoing and some individuals are influencing voters for their party.</p>
      <p>“Vote buying or selling is an electoral offence, anybody found culpable will be prosecuted,” he said.</p>
      <p>He warned politicians against violence and use of undemocratic means to win election.</p>
      <p>He said: “Nobody should attempt to promote violence; our attention should be to have a credible election.”</p>
