      <h1>Expert to women: How to choose your bras</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:23:03+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:23</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>A Gynaecologist at the Specialists’ Hospital, Bauchi, Dr. Habiba Ismail, has cautioned women on their choice of brassieres.</p>
      <p>Ismail said the caution had become imperative in order for the women to allow free flow of blood to the breast region.</p>
      <p>Ismail gave the advice on Tuesday in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria in Bauchi.</p>
      <p>She said the use of brassieres that had iron “push up” now fashionable and trending, could impede blood circulation.</p>
      <p>She said: “Brassieres with iron are trending but could cause harm to women.</p>
      <p>“Women should use brassieres without iron to allow free flow of blood in the breast region.</p>
      <p>“The iron in the brassieres could lead to breast problems due to the inability of blood to get to the region.”</p>
      <p>Ismail said non-flow of blood could cause ailments related to breast region, including cancer.</p>
      <p>She reminded women that cancer of the breast had become a public health issue, hence the need to take preventive  measures could not be over emphasised.</p>
