      <h2>Bergwijn is thought to be wanted by Manchester United's transfer boffins but is only willing to move on if he is to play at the highest level</h2>

      <p>Manchester United are reportedly in with a chance of signing PSV Eindhoven winger Steven Bergwijn- but only if they manage to qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old came through the academy at PSV and scored 14 goals in 33 appearances in the Eredivisie last season, leading to speculation linking him with some of Europe's elite clubs.</p>
      <p>Bergwijn ended up signing a new contract with the Dutch side to keep him at the club until 2023, but that won't stop the likes of United sniffing around the player again in the summer.</p>
      <p>And sources close to the Holland international say he will consider a move, but only to a club who are playing Champions League football.</p>

      <p>United scouts have reportedly been watching Bergwijn with interest, although he is currently out of action with a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>If he does end up leaving PSV are likely to demand a fee of at least Â£40m, and they are in a strong negotiating position with the player having over three years of his current contract left to run.</p>
      <p>Bergwijn, who has won seven caps for the Dutch national side, has scored three goals so far this season and created seven assists, but hasn't played since October 24 after picking up his injury in a Europa League game against LASK Linz.</p>

      <p>The signing of Bergwijn would be a fascinating prospect for United, and he could provide the perfect foil for fellow winger and summer signing Dan James.</p>
      <p>United are being linked with a number of players in the January transfer window as they look to improve their offensive options, with the likes of Bournemouth's Callum Wilson, Mario Mandzukic of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and Lyon's Moussa Dembele all being touted as possible options.</p>
