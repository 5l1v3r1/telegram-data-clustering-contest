      <p>The movie still looks a touch nuts, but Sonic's design is definitely a huge improvement.</p>
      <p>The latest trailer, Trailer D, dropped late Tuesday evening and showed off everything you need to see from the new <i>Sonic</i> design. The blue hedgehog is a little less life-like in its dimensions, and he's a little more palatable now. The teeth aren't so freakish either, and Sonic has much shorter legs now.</p>

      <p>So Sonic looks more like a cartoon character now than someone in a suit, which is nice. How James Marsden and Jim Carrey are going to carry this one through.</p>
