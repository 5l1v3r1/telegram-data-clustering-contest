      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> didn't appear to let the news of X Factor's dropped ratings lower his spirits as he attended ITV's Palooza tonight.</p>
      <p>The veteran music mogul, 60, flashed his perfectly pearly whites as walked the red carpet with his glamorous long-term girlfriend Lauren Silverman at London's Royal Festival Hall in the Southbank Centre.</p>
      <p>The TV judge grinned as he posed up a storm alongside his stunning girlfriend who turned heads in a sexy velvet dress with dramatic hemline detailing.</p>
      <p>Simon opted for his trademark dapper appearance with a white buttoned down shirt flaunting the results of his recent 20lb weight loss and a navy two-piece suit.</p>

      <p>The glamorous couple put on a loved-up display at the annual ITV glitz-fest as they cosied together for sweet snaps.</p>
      <p>The smitten pair joined the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vicky-pattison">Vicky Pattison</a> , Gemma Collins and Ferne McCann at the glamorous London evening.</p>

      <p>The music manager's appearance at the event was a brave one, considering recent reports that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> ratings are the lowest ever.</p>
      <p>Despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon</a> giving the show a face lift with the new Celebrity series, the show hasn't been hitting the right note with audiences.</p>
      <p>As many as 800,000 people turned off from the Celebrity version of the show.</p>
      <p>Figures fell to 2.8million after ratings had peaked with 3.8million viewers tuning in to see the stars battle it out on stage.</p>
      <p>Simon has been battling to save his show as its viewing figures continue to fall.</p>
      <p>It pulled in 19.4 million for the final in its 2010 heyday. But on Saturday the celeb version only had 3.1 million.</p>

      <p>GMB presenter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/piers-morgan">Piers Morgan</a> had a dig at the show after Saturday night's ratings were announced.</p>
      <p>The Celebrity Chase thrashed Simon's show last weekend and Piers insisted on bragging about his appearance on the quiz.</p>
      <p>He told viewers on Monday: "We had the highest rated show on ITV in the entire day.</p>
      <p>We smashed X Factor in the ratings. The GMB magic bringing its way to prime time."</p>
      <p>The controversial telly host continued: "Well if X Factor is getting three million and we're getting three and a half..."</p>

      <p>The Mirror exclusively revealed Simon scrapped the idea at the last minute after struggling to get any big name former stars to take part.</p>
