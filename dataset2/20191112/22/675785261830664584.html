      <h2>Sterling won't play any part in England's game against Montenegro on Thursday after being dropped following an altercation with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi has described Raheem Sterling as a ‘big leader’ in the England squad.</p>
      <p>And the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> star believes Sterling is a role model with both club and country.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi stuck to the party line, insisting the squad had talked about the Sterling-Gomez situation and were happy moving on to the game against Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>But he was keen to emphasise just how important Sterling is to the young players in this England squad.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi said: “Raheem is like an idol to me … what he’s doing for club and country is an amazing thing which I will try to replicate myself.</p>

      <p>“It is an amazing feeling to have someone like him doing what he’s doing and being around you every time. I want to keep learning off what he does.</p>
      <p>“He’s very encouraging, very positive about everything he does. He’s a big leader in the team.</p>
      <p>“When someone like that has a big say on racism, it is a big feeling for all of us. He is sticking up for everyone who is involved in the game. It is a great feeling to know he’s going to do that.”</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi was less forthcoming when asked about Gareth Southgate’s decision to drop Sterling for his altercation with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>“What’s happened, happened,” said Hudson-Odoi. “It is a situation where we have dealt with it as a team. We have moved on.</p>

      <p>“We have had a little talk with each other and made sure everything is OK.</p>
      <p>“We just want to move on as a team and focus on the game.”</p>
      <p>England require only a point from their two games against Montenegro and Kosovo to secure qualification for next summer's Euro 2020.</p>
