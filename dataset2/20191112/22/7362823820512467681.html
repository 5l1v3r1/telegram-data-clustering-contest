      <h1>Germany opens school for intelligence agencies in Berlin, once dubbed ‘capital of spies’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:10:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Frank Miles</a></address>
      <p>Berlin was dubbed the ‘capital of spies’ during the Cold War, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany">Germany</a>'s capital remains a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">hotspot of espionage</a> to this day.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the country’s foreign and domestic intelligence agencies opened the joint Center for Intelligence Service Training in response to German lawmakers’ demands they cut costs by merging their long-separate training facilities.</p>
      <p>Located close to where the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall">Berlin Wall</a> once sliced the city in two, the spy school is located at the new $1.1 billion headquarters of the foreign intelligence agency BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst, otherwise known as Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service), which opened earlier this year and houses 4,000 staff, according to The Associated Press.</p>

      <p>With space for 700 students, more than 110 of whom can live on site, the school offers lessons in covert observation, law, interrogation and information technology.</p>
      <p>Students will learn practical skills such as how to fend off cyberattacks, foil terrorists and shake off hostile agents on their tail. Students include recruits fresh out of high school, as well as those who already have completed first degrees and want to pursue a two-year Masters in Intelligence and Security.</p>
      <p>Known by its German acronym, ZNAF, the facility includes laboratories, workshops and video studies — all strictly off-limits to media.</p>
