      <p>MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis. - The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin has called on the Menomonee Falls School Board to retire the Menomonee Falls High School mascot, citing studies that race-based mascots are damaging to students.</p>
      <p>"Race-based mascots and imagery perpetuate damaging stereotypes and undermine the educational experience of all students," said Chris Ott, ACLU of Wisconsin executive director. "Our schools should be fostering safe and inclusive learning environments for all students â€“ not promoting racist stereotypes and imagery. Human beings are not mascots, and the evidence is clear that race-based mascots create a hostile environment that is harmful to our students and schools."</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.aclu-wi.org/en/news/aclu-wisconsin-calls-menomonee-falls-retire-racist-mascot">news release</a>, the American Psychiatric Association called for American Indian mascots to be immediately retired in 2005 because they teach "misleading, and too often, insulting images of American Indians.</p>
      <p>Eighteen school districts across the state have urged the Wisconsin Association of School Boards to lobby for a law that would ban mascots that could be considered offensive, according to the release. The release said 31 school districts in Wisconsin use Native American or tribal imagery for their school.</p>
