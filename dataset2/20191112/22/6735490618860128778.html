      <p>Dave Grohl has just hit the street — “Sesame Street”, that is, with the Foo Fighters frontman dropping in for a special song with Elmo and Big Bird.</p>
      <p>In a new video shared by the beloved children’s TV show, Elmo introduces his “friend, Mr. Dave Grohl,” for a song titled “Here We Go”.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to come here and be with my friends Big Bird and Elmo,” Grohl tells the duo. “You know, I was just thinking, there’s friends everywhere, even the ones that you don’t know.”</p>

      <p>In the video, the trio is seen travelling throughout the U.S. to meet new friends — through the magic of green screen, of course — while Elmo even gets to show off his guitar skills.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that Grohl has spent time with Muppets; not only did he appear in the 2011 feature film “The Muppets” (playing Animal’s replacement in a Muppets cover band called The Moopets), he also faced off with Animal in an epic drum battle during an appearance on ABC’s short-lived 2015 series “The Muppets”.
