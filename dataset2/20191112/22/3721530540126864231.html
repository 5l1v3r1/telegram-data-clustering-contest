      <p><i>Unity of Command 2</i>, the sequel to the hit 2011 wargame, is out today on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/steam">Steam</a>. Full price is $29.99, with a discount of 10% during its launch window.</p>
      <p>The original <i>Unity of Command</i> was an operational-level wargame set in World War II. Players moved around massive formations of infantry and armor along the Eastern Front, and keeping unit cohesion and lines of supply was integral to winning the war. <i>Unity of Command</i> picks up where that game left off, while adding plenty of additional depth. According to its Steam page, the game now includes dynamic campaigns set on the Western Front.</p>
      <p>“For the first time in <i>Unity of Command</i> you will face Fog of War,” adds publisher 2x2 Games on the storefront page. “Reveal the unknown by capturing enemy soldiers and launching recon to gather intel on enemy troop positions. Enemy panzers will seek to capture your units’ stragglers — regroup and strike back!”</p>
      <p>Developers 2x2 Games has an interesting backstory, including how the studio was formed on the heels of a deep connection with the original Winamp music player, of all things. Catch up with that storyline in our 2013 profile of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/5/14/4319958/unity-of-command-the-unlikely-origin">founder Tomislav Uzelac</a>.</p>
