      <h2>Fabian Delph was carrying an injury when he was called up, but it was hoped he'd be fit in time for England's upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:02:20+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Fabian Delph has pulled out of the England squad with an injury - but he will not be replaced, the FA has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder was carrying an injury when he was called up, but it was hoped he'd be fit in time for the Three Lions' upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Delph will now return to Goodison Park for further rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>A statement from the FA read: "The midfielder arrived with an injury but it was hoped he would be available to play a part in the Three Lions' forthcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>"However, it has now been decided that Delph is unlikely to feature and will return to his club for further rehabilitation."</p>
      <p>England have not named a replacement for the matches against Montenegro and Kosovo, in what is another blow for the in-form Jack Grealish.</p>

      <p>Aston Villa midfielder Grealish was expected to get a call-up the first time round, but will miss out once again, despite boss Gareth Southgate previously singing his praises.</p>
      <p>"He's a very good player. I've watched him closely this season," said Southgate. "The reality of that is that he's up against [Raheem] Sterling, [Marcus] Rashford, [Callum] Hudson-Odoi, [Jadon] Sancho in those wide areas.</p>
      <p>"The competition in that area is a really high level. I think Jack's a very good player. He's very close. He's just got to keep playing the way he is, and if we had issues over the weekend, I wouldn't hesitate to call him into the squad."</p>

      <p>Delph's last appearance for England came in the Nations League third-place play-off win over Switzerland in June.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has made 10 appearances for Everton this season but missed the Toffees' 2-1 win at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
