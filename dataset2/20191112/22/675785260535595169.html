      <h1>Bashful Liam Payne reluctant to open up about rumoured Naomi Campbell romance</h1>
      <h2>Liam insisted Naomi was a mate as Ant Middleton used SAS tactics to make his spill the beans on his love life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:38:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:38</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liam-payne">Liam Payne</a> appeared reluctant to speak about his romance with Naomi Campbell after pal Ant Middleton questioned him about his love life.</p>
      <p>Ant employed SAS tactics to get info out of Liam during the show they made together, Ant Middleton and Liam Payne: Straight Talking.</p>
      <p>Specifically, Ant wanted to know about the singer's rumoured romance with supermodel Naomi.</p>
      <p>The pair reportedly struck up a romance earlier this year, something which Liam denies.</p>
      <p>"No," he laughed, "She was just a friend."</p>
      <p>Ant pushed on, demanding to know if she was a "friend friend."</p>
      <p>Liam shot back: "She was just a buddy, old  buddy, old pal."</p>

      <p>Ant was having none of it, insisting: "Come on Liam, you know she wasn't an old buddy old pal. I think the whole world knows that."</p>
      <p>"You believe what you want," the former One Direction star chuckled, "I'm not saying anything!</p>
      <p>"When I like someone, I like them."</p>
      <p>During a more heartfelt moment, Liam opened up about his ex and mother of his child, Cheryl.</p>

      <p>He's always been candid about his respect for Cheryl, especially as a mother.</p>
      <p>Liam told Ant: "We genuinely get on, for sure. There's just so many parallels from life that we draw from each other.</p>
      <p>"I just hope she's happy more than anything. She deserves it, she works hard, she's a great mum."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The show's generally pretty deep, and has handled some profound emotional topics.</p>
      <p>Liam notably opened up about the pressures of fame, telling his new pal: "For some certain circumstances I'm quite lucky to be here still.</p>
      <p>"There are times when that level of loneliness and people getting into you everyday it's like, 'When will this end?'</p>
      <p>"That's almost nearly killed me a couple of times."</p>
