      <h1>Andy Murray gives adorable name to newborn son - but admits he doesn't like middle name</h1>
      <h2>The two-time Wimbledon champion and his wife Kim celebrated the birth of their third child just days after Murray won the European Open in Antwerp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/, Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Andy Murray and his wife Kim Sears have named their new son Teddy, and have kept true to Murray's Scottish roots by giving him the middle name Barron.</p>
      <p>Teddy was born in London only a few days after Murray won the European Open in Antwerp just nine months after announcing he may have to retire.</p>
      <p>He joins three-year-old Sophia and one-year-old Edie in the Murray family, and the 32-year-old explained the name Barron runs in the family.</p>
      <p>"The middle name got in there," Murray said. "I don't actually love the name. My dad's middle name was Barron, his dad was Barron, my granddad's dad, so I kept that. But Teddy, my wife liked that so she chose it."</p>

      <p>Murray added that his life his become somewhat more hectic since the new arrival, and jokingly ruled out adding a fourth member of the family.</p>
      <p>"It's been good, it's just busy," he continued. "We’ve got three under four now and two dogs so you’ve got to keep an eye out all the time but it’s been good, sleeping fine. Everyone’s healthy. This time the girls have been really good actually.</p>
      <p>"The first time when we went from one to two the first week or so was a bit, I don’t know, a bit of jealousy. But this time they’ve been brilliant. One more for mixed doubles? I hope not.”</p>
      <p>Murray said having his children watching him play tennis was one of his motivations for continuing in the sport, despite looking likely to retire after last year's French Open.</p>

      <p>"I don't know when we'll stop," he said. "Selfishly I'd like for them to watch me play but ultimately it's not that important. Hopefully I can get a few more years out of my body and see what happens after that."</p>
      <p>Murray is next due in action in Madrid for the Davis Cup next week.</p>
