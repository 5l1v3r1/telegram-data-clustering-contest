      <p>REUTERS: McDonald's Corp workers are filing a lawsuit seeking to force the fast-food chain to confront a "systemic problem" of sexual harassment, spokespeople for the workers said in a press statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A copy of the proposed class-action complaint was not immediately available. McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

      <p>McDonald's has long been a target of employees' rights advocates, including Fight for US$15, which pushes for higher minimum wages and better treatment for workers in fast food, retail, child care, home health aid and other businesses.</p>
      <p>According to the spokespeople, McDonald's workers have filed more than 50 complaints in the last three years alleging a variety of illegal conduct in corporate-owned and franchised McDonald's restaurants.</p>
      <p>Workers pursuing the lawsuit are backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, the spokespeople said.</p>
