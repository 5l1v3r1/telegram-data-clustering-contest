      <p>SUNNYSIDE, Queens (WABC) -- Police are investigating after a bicyclist stopped at a red light in a bike lane in Queens was rear-ended by a hit-and-run driver Monday night.</p>
      <p>The incident was reported at Greenpoint and Borden avenues in Sunnyside around 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Police say the driver of a grey 2006 Toyota Sienna did not stay at the scene.</p>
      <p>Another person on a bicycle came upon the injured bicyclist and called for help.</p>
      <p>The bicyclist suffered a back injury, but he is expected to be OK.</p>
      <p>The same driver is also wanted for striking another Toyota two blocks away at Greenpoint and Bradley avenues, at around the same time, and also leaving that scene.</p>
      <p>A 37-year-old female passenger in that car was treated for minor injuries.</p>
      <p>John Farrell was cycling home from work at the time and witnessed the incident.</p>
      <p>"I just saw the van plow through the guy, he was in a lot of pain and his bike was destroyed," Farrell said.</p>
      <p>Farrell said he was hit last week and the incident could have been so much worse.</p>
      <p>"His bike the back of it's gone, which means to me the next thing is him, it's a scary moment, you're not in a car, don't know where you are, think you are OK and you just want to be OK," Farrell said.</p>
      <p>The bike lane is dangerously sandwiched between two driving lanes and it is poorly marked with little lighting.</p>
      <p>Farrell and others want police to issue reckless drivers more violations and for the city to create more protected bike lanes.</p>
      <p>"The West Side Highway is a good example, the bike lane runs the length of Manhattan and Queens Boulevard, if they were better at enforcing the law, that would be a wonderful place to ride," he said.</p>
