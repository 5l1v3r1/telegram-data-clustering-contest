      <p>Edmund McMillen, he of The Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy and The End is Nigh fame, has just released a new game. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148650/The_Legend_of_BumBo/">The Legend of Bum-Bo</a> is a "puzzle based deckbuilding roguelike" which undoubtedly looks like a McMillen game, except it has a gloriously unusual cardboard cut-out aesthetic.</p>
      <p>Co-developed with James Interactive, it's described as a prequel to The Binding of Isaac, and one of its features is "poop".Â </p>
      <p>"...Players collect hordes of items that can be modified, upgraded and comboed with others in many interesting ways," so reads the Steam description. "Play as one of many Bum-bo, each with its own unique abilities, as they smash, bash and splash their way through a variety of cardboard monstrosities, giant bosses and dark personal urges..."</p>
      <p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
