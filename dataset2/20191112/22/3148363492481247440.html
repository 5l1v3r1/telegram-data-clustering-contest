      <p>Police responded to a call in colonia Sánchez Taboada shortly after midnight Tuesday. They found a black plastic bag secured with duct tape which contained a headless human corpse with the head included. The unidentified remains are believed to be of a male approximately 20 to 25 years of age, according to local <a href="https://www.uniradioinforma.com/noticias/policiaca/582456/hallan-cabeza-humana-y-cuerpo-decapitado-en-la-colonia-sanchez-taboada.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Statistics released by the state attorney general’s office show for November-to-date 60 registered homicides.</p>
      <p>In response to the ongoing cartel violence in the city, the federal government announced the <a href="https://zetatijuana.com/2019/11/arriban-a-tijuana-200-elementos-de-la-guardia-nacional/">arrival</a> of 200 National Guardsmen late last week. The deployed personnel are tasked with intelligence and investigative work, according to State Attorney General Guillermo Ruiz Hernández.</p>
      <p>Most of the new investigative personnel will focus on open cases to prevent detained suspects from release in Tijuana and across the border state. Suspects are often freed due to lack of evidence.</p>
      <p>In nearby Playas del Rosarito, police <a href="https://www.uniradioinforma.com/noticias/policiaca/582332/detienen-a-dos-hombres-que-cargaban-un-torso-humano.html">arrested</a> two suspected cartel operatives carrying a black suitcase holding the dismembered body parts of a presumed homicide victim. The two men tossed the luggage and attempted to flee when approached by the police early Sunday morning.</p>
