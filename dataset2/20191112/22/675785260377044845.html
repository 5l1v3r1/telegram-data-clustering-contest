      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Shilton's career will be among those celebrated on the pitch at half-time of England's match against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Peter Shilton will be honoured at Wembley as part of the 1,000 game celebrations after reaching an incredible milestone.</p>
      <p>It is hard to believe that Shilton – <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England’s</a> all time record appearance holder – has played in an eighth of all their internationals.</p>
      <p>England legend Shilton, 70, who won 125 caps during a glittering 20 year career for his country, has been invited as a guest of honour and will be presented on the pitch at half time.</p>
      <p>“It’s quite a milestone for the FA. I had 20 years with England, that’s a long time and obviously there was a period where Ray Clemence was looked upon under Don Revie as No 1 so I had a lot of trips as well as a lot of caps,” said Shilton.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been an honour to me, it was always my main ambition to play for England at whatever level I was at.</p>

      <p>“When I was a schoolboy, it was for England Schoolboys, that was my main aim and I managed to play at Wembley in front of 90,000 when I was 15. I was fortunate enough to have some luck with injuries but also to make my dreams come true and it’s always been a massive honour for me to play for England.”</p>
      <p>Shilton, however, does feel that the Football Association and some clubs lost sight of the importance of former players but praised Gareth Southgate for “raising the bar” and putting the pride back into playing for your country.</p>
      <p>England manager Southgate often gets former greats to make presentations to new caps in the dressing room and Shilton believes those sort of touches make all the difference.</p>
      <p>Shilton said: “That’s one of the good things that Gareth has done, he’s brought that standard back into it with the England squad.</p>

      <p>“It’s just raising the standards and, as a manager, that is what you have to do at international level. It is the ultimate, playing for your country.</p>
      <p>“I think it went out of the game a little bit, even at club level. I heard they wouldn’t give well known former players complimentary tickets and they seemed to turn their back on history.</p>
      <p>“But that’s started to come back and that goes for clubs as well. They seem to have realised that history is not a threat, it’s a vital part of the prestige of the club.”</p>
      <p>Shilton will go down as one of the all-time greats and is arguably the best goalkeeper of them all.</p>

      <p>He picked out the World Cup in Italy in 1990 as a highlight but also the contrast to qualifying for that World Cup compared to missing out for the 1974 tournament after bring held by Poland at Wembley in the famous Jan Tomaszewski game as the visiting goalkeeper saved nearly everything.</p>
      <p>Shilton said: “Favourite memory would be Italia 90 because we did to get to the semis, we were so close in the end. It was the luck of the shoot-out.</p>
      <p>“I was 40, I thought I’d had a good tournament particularly in the quarter-final and semi-final games.</p>
      <p>“I suppose one of the biggest disappointments for me was when we drew 1-1 at Wembley with Poland, the Tomaszewski game and we failed to qualify under Alf Ramsey. It resulted in him getting the sack.</p>
      <p>“It was such a low point for me because I wanted to play in the World Cup so much and I had a part in the goal with Norman Hunter where we both didn’t distinguish ourselves too well.”</p>
