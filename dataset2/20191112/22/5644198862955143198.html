      <p>Juul Labs Inc will cut nearly US$1 billion in costs next year, a company official said on Tuesday, as its new chief executive officer tries to turn around the e-cigarette maker following a regulatory crackdown.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Juul Labs Inc will cut nearly US$1 billion in costs next year, a company official said on Tuesday, as its new chief executive officer tries to turn around the e-cigarette maker following a regulatory crackdown.</p>
      <p>K.C. Crosthwaite, a former executive at major shareholder Altria , is tasked with fixing the company's battered public image and shrinking valuation as the regulatory moves on vaping threaten to upend the fast-growing industry.</p>

      <p>The official also said Juul would cut around 650 jobs, or 16per cent of its 4,051 strong workforce, starting Tuesday. The company had previously said it would cut 10-15per cent of its workforce by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>"As the vapor category undergoes a necessary reset, this reorganization will help JUUL Labs focus on reducing underage use, investing in scientific research, and creating new technologies," Crosthwaite said in a statement emailed to Reuters.</p>
      <p>The cost cuts will impact Juul's marketing budget and are the latest effort by Crosthwaite, who last month reshuffled the San Francisco-based company's top management.</p>
      <p>In October, Marlboro cigarettes maker Altria, which has a 35per cent stake in Juul, wrote down the value of its investment by US$4.5 billion, cutting Juul's valuation by a third to roughly US$24 billion.</p>
