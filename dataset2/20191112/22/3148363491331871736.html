      <p>Ciaramella reportedly was detailed to the Obama White House in 2015 and returned to the CIA during the Trump administration in 2017.</p>
      <p><i>Real Clear Investigations</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/pinnacle-of-irresponsibility-attorneys-decline-to-confirm-cia-officer-eric-ciaramella-is-whistleblower">named</a> Ciaramella as possibly being the whistleblower whose complaint sparked <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">impeachment proceedings against President Trump</a>. As reported by the <i>Examiner</i>, Fox News’ legal analyst Gregg Jarrett indicated that a key takeaway was the “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fox-legal-analyst-signals-alleged-whistleblower-could-be-implicated-in-fisa-report">reported direct relationship</a>” Ciaramella had with former President Barack Obama’s CIA Director John Brennan and national security adviser Susan Rice, as well as the “Democratic National Committee operative who <a href="https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/10/30/whistleblower_exposed_close_to_biden_brennan_dnc_oppo_researcher_120996.html">dug up dirt</a> on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.”</p>

      <p>Our analysis of these Obama White House visitor logs raises obvious additional questions about the Obama administration, Ukraine and the related impeachment scheme targeting President Trump. Both Mr. Ciaramella and Ms. Chalupa should be questioned about the meetings documented in these visitor logs.</p>
