      <h1>'Meaningless statistics mongering': Trump environment enforcers push back at criticism over declining numbers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:57:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:57</time> by <a rel="author">Abby Smith</a></address>
      <p>The Trump administration is just as aggressive in prosecuting polluters as its predecessors, top environmental enforcement officials said Tuesday, even if the number of cases isn’t as high.</p>
      <p>“We absolutely are” dedicated to enforcing environmental laws, Susan Bodine, the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement chief, said at a conference hosted by the American Bar Association. “We are very, very busy, and very much leaning into our cases.”</p>
      <p>Bodine was pushing back on criticism from environmental groups that the EPA’s enforcement numbers have sharply declined during the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>For example, the environmental group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility in a <a href="https://www.peer.org/criminal-enforcement-collapse-at-epa/">report</a> earlier this year said the EPA in fiscal year 2018 generated the fewest new criminal case referrals since 1988, suggesting the drop-off was part of “the Trump plan to cripple the EPA,” according to Kyla Bennett, the group’s science policy director.</p>
      <p>But Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the Justice Department’s top environment attorney, said environmental groups critiques are “just meaningless statistics mongering.”</p>
      <p>“Susan and I are not in the widget-producing business,” Clark added in remarks to the conference. “Each of the cases that come to us are a different thing.”</p>
      <p>Bodine added that she didn’t want to give her staff a quota for case numbers.</p>
      <p>“I could direct the staff to get the numbers up and go after a lot of really small cases, but to what end?” she said. “Are we making a difference in terms of water quality and air quality? We want to have the cases that make a difference.”</p>
      <p>Taking on bigger cases is also the defense the Obama EPA’s enforcement chief, Cynthia Giles, gave lawmakers for their declining enforcement numbers, Bodine added.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if it was OK if she says it, and not OK if I say it,” Bodine said.</p>
