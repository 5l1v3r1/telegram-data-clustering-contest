        <b>Labour has pledged to increase NHS England’s budget by an average 3.9 per cent per year in real terms over the next four years if it forms the next government. </b>
      </p>
      <p>This compares to the current 3.4 per cent average in the five year spending settlement running to 2023-24..</p>
      <p>The party says it would also inject £15bn into the capital budget - spread over a five-year parliament - and increase the non-NHS part of the wider Department of Health and Social Care budget.</p>
      <p>New revenue for the NHS would be used on a raft of measures, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>restoring constitutional waiting time standards;</li>
        <li>a series of improvements to mental health services, particularly in the community;</li>
        <li>restoring the training bursary for nurses;</li>
        <li>an expansion of GP training places;</li>
        <li>better public health services through £1bn extra investment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NHS England’s revenue budget, which pays for the day-to-day running of NHS services, is currently around £120bn, and Labour’s pledge for an average annual increase of 3.9 per cent in real terms <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/finance-and-efficiency/nhs-gets-34pc-a-year-in-major-new-funding-deal/7022674.article">compares directly to Theresa May’s five-year settlement, announced last year, of 3.4 per cent</a>.</p>
      <p>The party has also set out proposals for the overall Department of Health and Social Care budget, which includes money held outside the NHS “ringfence”, as well as NHS England.</p>
      <p>Labour’s plans would increase this total budget by an average of 4.3 per cent each year in real terms.</p>
      <p>The Health Foundation think tank said this would mean health spending rising “at a faster rate than any previous government over the NHS’s history, apart from the Blair/Brown years when health spending grew by 6 per cent a year”.</p>
      <p>Additional capital spending would be used to create a strategic “mental health infrastructure fund” to abolish dormitory wards and “end out of area [bed] placements”, as well as an overhaul of the primary care estate and buying new scanning equipment, Labour said.</p>
      <p>The current annual capital budget is about £6bn, and £15bn of additional money over five years would appear to surpass the recommendations made by Sir Robert Naylor in his review of NHS estates for an additional £10bn which Theresa May promised to match during the 2017 election campaign.</p>
      <p>The plans are due to be announced by the party on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the plans would be funded from Labour’s proposals to reverse corporation tax cuts and by “taxing the richest in society”.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Ashworth, shadow health secretary, is expected to say: “With experts warning this winter is set to be one of the worst the truth is our NHS is crying out for a financial rescue plan to deliver real change for patients.</p>
      <p>“We are announcing today the levels of investment our NHS needs to not only again provide the quality care our sick and elderly deserve but secures the NHS for the future as well. We’ll invest more to prevent people becoming ill in the first place and we’ll give mental health and wellbeing a greater priority than ever before.”</p>
      <p>The King’s Fund, another think tank, said it was important the funding pledges covered the wider DHSC budget and not just NHS England.</p>
      <p>But it said social care would also be a key factor for NHS sustainability, adding: “The current social care system is not fit for purpose and is failing the people who rely on it. A key test for party manifestos will be whether they include plans for fundamental reform of social care funding.”</p>
