      <blockquote>Leftists in Canada succeeded in getting Canadian hockey icon Don Cherry fired after he made comments about the lack of poppies worn for Remembrance Day by recent immigrants in Ontario. The 85-year-old hockey veteran <a href="https://twitter.com/thescore/status/1193978076075642880?s=21">was fired</a> on Remembrance Day by broadcaster Sportsnet after comments made over the weekend.</blockquote>

      <p>An online petition <a href="https://www.rebelnews.com/support-don-cherry-petition">launched</a> by Rebel News has yielded over 65,000 signatures as of this article’s publication.</p>
      <p>Assorted leftists <a href="https://www.blogto.com/sports_play/2019/11/people-canceling-sportsnet-don-cherry/">decried</a> Cherry’s comments as “xenophobic” and “racist.”</p>
      <p>Cherry has steadfastly stood by his comments.</p>
      <p>“I know what I said, and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honor our fallen soldiers,” Cherry <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/11/12/hockey-commentator-don-cherry-unapologetic-after-firing-over-pro-veterans-day-comments/">told</a> the <i>Toronto Star</i> on Monday, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2019/11/11/don-cherry-fired-from-sportsnet-following-toxic-rant.html">adding</a>, “To keep my job, I cannot be turned into a tamed robot.</p>
      <p>“I don’t regret a thing,” Cherry continued. “If you notice, I never said ‘immigrants,’ I never said anything, I said, ‘you people’ and they could have been Scottish, they could have been Irish, they could have been anything, but that’s the way the world is today. They listened to those people.”</p>
      <p>In 2010, Cherry paid a surprise <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/cherry-makes-surprise-afghanistan-visit-1.912667">visit</a> to Canadian armed forces stationed in Afghanistan on Christmas Day.</p>
