      <h1>Coronation Street 'highly likely' to begin airing seven episodes a week, writer says</h1>
      <h2>Corrie writer Ellen Taylor has said that the cast and crew are already struggling with filming six episodes a week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:48:16+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>A writer on Coronation Street has suggested that it is highly likely that the ITV soap will follow in rival Emmerdale's footsteps by airing seven episodes a week.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Corrie is scheduled to air two episodes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, upped from the original five a week.</p>
      <p>And it looks like the number of episodes could increase even more, which the writer has said it is already struggling with.</p>
      <p>Ellen Taylor, who wrote Sinead Tinker's harrowing cancer storyline, has said that the six episodes a week is already putting a strain on the writing team, directors and producers.</p>
      <p>She is also worried that it will get even more difficult for the crew and has become convinced that the soap's episodes will soon be upped to seven a week.</p>

      <p>The writer told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10333478/coronation-street-seven-episodes-week-writer-reveals/">The Sun</a> : "Increased volume isn’t always a good thing. It’s a lot more work for everyone. It’s great for more Corrie, but is it best in the long run? I don’t know.</p>
      <p>"We’re never going to go back down. Emmerdale are already at seven episodes so you know it’s going to happen at some point."</p>
      <p>Pointing out that there are a lot of challenges in terms of production, including needing more cast and a bigger set, she said that it also threw up challenges for her.</p>
      <p>She said: "When you have six episodes, particularly with our transmission pattern, it’s like you have to ramp up the story very quickly.</p>

      <p>"When it’s six episodes a week you have to ramp everything up more for the next Monday and I think it makes the story telling more heightened - you’ve got to have more dramatic moments because you’ve got to keep hooking the viewers in and I’m not sure that’s always a good thing."</p>
      <p>However she conceded that that was the nature of TV today and that everything has become "a bit more high octane".</p>
      <p>She added: "I still think Corrie maintains a balance very well but I think because of those six episodes a week those high octane storylines and hooks to keep the viewers there have become a more dominant feature of the process."</p>
