      <p>Fujifilm shook things up a few years ago with the release of the GFX 50S, their first medium-format mirrorless camera, indicating a desire to completely skip over the craze of the "full-frame mirrorless" market. Instead, they built an entirely new system and format around a larger medium-format sensor, yet managed to create a fairly compact camera system that was also significantly less expensive than traditional medium-format camera systems -- especially so with their second camera, the GFX 50R.</p>
      <p>But Fujifilm had bigger plans beyond these initial 50-megapixel GFX cameras: enter the <a href="https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/fuji-gfx-100/fuji-gfx-100A.HTM">GFX 100</a>. Packing a 102-megapixel BSI medium-format image sensor with phase-detect hybrid AF as well as 5-axis in-body image stabilization and faster performance all in a rugged, DSLR-shaped body, the flagship Fuji GFX 100 is an altogether new camera that's unlike anything else currently on the market. The GFX 100 manages to offer even more impressive image quality than previous GFX cameras, as well as offering significantly better autofocusing speed, faster burst shooting capabilities, pro-oriented video recording features and excellent in-body stabilization. Indeed, the GFX 100 brings a level of versatility not typically found in medium-format camera systems. </p>

      <p>However, despite a lot of impressive specs and many "world's firsts", the Fuji GFX 100 is not without a few small setbacks. It's big and bulky, it's not as fast as most high-end full-frame mirrorless cameras and DSLRs, and it's quite expensive (though compared to other medium-format cameras, it's quite a steal).</p>
