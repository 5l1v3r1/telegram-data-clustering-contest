      </p>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) has been trading sideways for the better part of the day and continues to circle the $8,800 price mark. The world’s largest cryptocurrency bounced off a local low of $8,705 earlier today before moving to its current trading price at around $8,750, showing a small gain of 0.27% on the day.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin continues its struggle to hold on to its current trading levels, but traders, including Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, are starting to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-ranging-continues-as-trader-says-8-400-could-be-next">wonder</a> whether  BTC could drop further to around $8,400.</p>
      <p>Well-known crypto industry figure Bobby Lee, on the other hand, doesn’t fear BTC’s current price struggles, as he recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bobby-lee-500k-bitcoin-price-flippening-of-gold-will-come-by-2028">said</a> that Bitcoin will eventually surpass the market cap of gold and could ultimately be worth a whopping $1 million. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), meanwhile, is currently sitting at $186 per coin. The number one altcoin saw a small dip in sync with BTC to show a slight loss of around 0.1% at publishing time.</p>
      <p>Cointelegraph contributor Rakesh Upadhyay recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-analysis-11-11-btc-eth-xrp-bch-ltc-eos-bnb-bsv-xlm-trx">reported</a> that a breakout of $197.75 could be a positive move that will carry the price to the overhead resistance zone of $223.999 to $235.70. However, if the bears sink the price below the support at $173.841, Ether may decline to the $161.056-$151.829 support zone.</p>

      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, is currently trading at $0.271 per coin, down 1.44% at press time. The recent annual <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swell-the-news-xrp-drops-5-as-ripples-flagship-event-kicks-off">Swell conference</a>, where CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he doesn't think about the price of XRP in the short term, has failed to trigger any positive price action for the coin.</p>

      <h3>Top-20 coins show mixed signals</h3>
      <p>Most of the top 20 coins are trading sideways, with many seeing movement of under 1% in either direction.</p>
      <p>One of the only exceptions is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/neo-price-index">NEO</a>, which is showing an impressive gain of more than 10% in the last 24 hours, followed by Chainlink (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/chainlink-link">Link</a>), which is recording gains of 3.29% on the day.</p>
      <p>Cosmos (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/cosmos-atom">ATOM</a>), the number eighteen coin by market cap, took the biggest fall today with a loss of more than 4%.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap currently sits at $240 billion, with Bitcoin making up 66% of the total.</p>
