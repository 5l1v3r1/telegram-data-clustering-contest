      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:44:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Minister of Information an Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has described Chief Bisi Akande as “a man of principle, integrity and a politician with strict adherence to good governance’’.</p>
      <p>The minister hailed Akande, the pioneer National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress on Tuesday in Abuja at the public presentation and launch of a book, “The Challenges of Good Governance in Nigeria’’.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria reports that the book was written and dedicated in honour of Akande by Oluseyi Adetanmi.</p>
      <p>“What we witnessed today is a celebration of a man of principle, integrity and politician with strict adherence to good governance.</p>
      <p>“His undersdtanding of good governance is how positively government can impact on the people.</p>
      <p>“I am glad that speakers here today have spoken glowingly on how Chief Bisis Akande from his days in the 1960s till date has stand out as a man on integrity.</p>
      <p>“What we are celebrating today is the contrast to a generally accepted wrong notion that integrity does not pay,’’ Mohammed told newsmen at the event.</p>
      <p>The minister said that the essence of being in politics was to render good governance, selfless service to the populace and not about fat bank accounts.</p>
      <p>“For instance, we were told here today that when the military struck in 1983 and Chief Akande was arrested, they found only about N2000 in his bank account.</p>
      <p>“Today, we have many politicians in Nigeria that own so many houses, billions of Naira in their accounts, but they are not being celebrated like this man.</p>
      <p>“The implication of this is that, Integrity pays,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said that when he was the spokesman of APC, he learnt a lot working with Akande.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the book reviewer, Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George said that the 518-page book is a fitting tribute to Akande, “an astute politician whose life is worthy of emulation’’.</p>
      <p>He said Akande in his political career left legacy of good governance and the book was in honour of his contributions to good governance.</p>
      <p>Akinseye-George said the book examined issues of policing amd Police reform, resource control and fiscal federalism and challenges relating to Local Government autonomy.</p>
      <p>The reviewer said that the book also examined issues of economy diversification, Constitutional ammendment, freedom of press, achieving viable federalism and national cohesion.</p>
      <p>Present at the event were, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, ministers, lawmakers, representatives of Governors of Osun, Kano and Lagos.</p>
