      <p>Twenty-two Algerian demonstrators were handed one-year jail sentences on Tuesday for "undermining national unity" by bearing the Berber minority's flag during anti-regime protests, a prisoners' rights group said.</p>
      <p>The CNLD committee said on its Facebook page that a court in the capital's Sidi Mhamed district had sentenced the accused to 12 months in prison - half of it suspended - and fines of 30 000 dinars ($275).</p>
      <p>Said Salhi, vice president of the Algerian human rights groups LADDH, condemned the ruling as "heavy, hard and unexpected", adding that defence lawyers would appeal.</p>
      <p>Protesters had gathered outside the court on Monday ahead of the late night ruling, chanting: "Free the detainees!"</p>
      <p>Algeria has been rocked by months of street protests demanding an overhaul of the entire political system.</p>
      <p>Army chief General Ahmed Gaid Salah, the country's main powerbroker since the April resignation of longtime president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has banned protesters from bearing flags other than the Algerian one.</p>
      <p>He was apparently referring to the Berber - or Amazigh - flag, which demonstrators have been seen holding alongside the national ensign.</p>
      <p>Authorities arrested a group of 42 protesters on June 21 for brandishing the Berber ensign during rallies in Algiers.</p>
      <p>The trial of the 20 remaining defendants, including one currently in hospital, has been postponed to November 18, the CNLD committee said.</p>
      <p>Algeria is home to some 10 million Berbers, most living in Kabylie, a mountainous region to the east of Algiers that has long suffered marginalisation.</p>
      <p>In April 2001, the death of a high school student at a police station there sparked riots and a crackdown in which more than 120 were killed and hundreds wounded.</p>
      <p>Kabylie had been preparing to celebrate the 21st anniversary of its fight to secure recognition of its Berber identity.</p>
      <p>In 2002 the Berber language Tamazight was recognised as an official language alongside Arabic.</p>
      <p>Berbers are descended from the pre-Arab inhabitants of north Africa and still have a presence across the region, particularly in Algeria and Morocco</p>
