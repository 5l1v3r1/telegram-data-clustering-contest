      <p>KwaZulu-Natal police have arrested three men who allegedly murdered 15-year-old Cebisile Luphondwe,  burnt and then buried her body in a shallow grave outside a farm in Glencore.</p>
      <p>The police claimed Luphondwe and her boyfriend might have had an argument on Monday afternoon after which she was allegedly assaulted and stabbed to death.</p>
      <p>Provincial spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said her body was burned and buried in a shallow grave outside the farm in Glencore.</p>
      <p>"Family members opened a missing persons docket after she did not return home," added Mbele.</p>
      <p>The victim's boyfriend, aged 23, was arrested in Ladysmith.</p>

      <p>"The swift response of the integrated team in making sure that the alleged murderers were brought to book is highly commended.</p>
      <p>"We are appealing to residents to allow the police to conduct their investigation freely and not to take the law into their own hands," said KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula.</p>
