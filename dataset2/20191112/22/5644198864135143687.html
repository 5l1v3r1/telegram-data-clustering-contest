      <p>MADRID: Spain's Socialists and far-left Unidas Podemos party agreed on the basis of a coalition government on Tuesday (Nov 12), just two days after a parliamentary election delivered a highly fragmented parliament.</p>
      <p>The election - the country's fourth in four years - left Spain's parliament even more divided than a previous ballot in April, with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) retaining its lead but further away from a majority.</p>

      <p>"It's a deal for four years," Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, who is currently acting prime minister, said after signing the pact alongside Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.</p>
      <p>The unexpectedly fast preliminary agreement would require further steps including bringing in smaller parties and agreeing on who gets what position in the cabinet.</p>
      <p>If confirmed, it would be Spain's first coalition government since the country's return to democracy in the late 1970s.</p>
      <p>"Spain needs a stable government, a solid government," Sanchez said, adding that the deal was open to others.</p>
      <p>The combination of the 120 seats obtained by the Socialists and the 35 of Unidas Podemos falls short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament.</p>
      <p>The Socialists and Podemos had tried and failed to strike a government deal after the April election, which had prompted Sanchez to call the repeat ballot.</p>
      <p>The two men had been at odds for months and exchanged harsh words as acrimonious talks failed after the April election.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday they were all smiles, hugging after they signed the pact.</p>
      <p>"We've reached a preliminary agreement to create a progressive coalition government in Spain, which combines the experience of PSOE with the courage of Unidas Podemos," Iglesias said.</p>
      <p>Local media including La Sexta TV said that Iglesias would be deputy prime minister, something which Sanchez had refused in the post-April election talks. Sanchez had also at the time opposed a coalition government. The two leaders said details would come later and did not comment further.</p>
      <p>El Diario newspaper said they would try to get other parties on board, including the market-friendly Ciudadanos, far-left Mas Pais and the Basque nationalist PNV.</p>
