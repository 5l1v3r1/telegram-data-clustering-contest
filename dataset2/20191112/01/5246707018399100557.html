      <p>Remember the Super Nintendo mouse? It was originally designed for the 1992 release <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a></b> and was eventually made compatible with multiple other games on the system. The system's predecessor – the NES – didn't ever receive an official accessory like this, but now, after 34 years, there's at least a mouse inspired by the classic system.</p>
      <p>Introducing the 8BitDo N30 – a 2.4GHz wireless computer mouse for Windows and Mac that looks like a Nintendo Entertainment System controller and is <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-n30-24g-wireless-mouse">available right now</a> for US$24.99. The rubber pad A and B buttons act as the main mouse buttons, a 3D touch panel in between makes scrolling a breeze, and the D-Pad on the side helps with navigation.</p>

      <p>If this design looks familiar, that's most likely because you've seen the original mock-ups that have been doing the rounds online for a long time now. 8BitDo decided to collaborate with the Swedish industrial designer Daniel Jansson this year, after seeing the "true value" in his original concept to turn it into a real product.</p>
      <p>The mouse requires a single AA battery and can run on this for 100-120 hours, according to the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-n30-24g-wireless-mouse">8BitDo website</a>. <i>Do you think you would be interested in using this mouse? Tell us below.</i></p>
