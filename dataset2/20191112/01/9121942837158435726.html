      <p>PARIS (AP) — The next European Commission president says she wants to spend almost a third more on foreign policy goals over the next half decade to better establish the EU as a global player.</p>
      <p>Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday that the extra money is needed to develop a stronger strategic culture of the bloc, which is often criticized as high on ideals but low on effective impact.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen said at the Paris Peace Forum that “there is need for stable and responsible leadership. We all have to contribute.”</p>
      <p>Her demand for more funds for such foreign policy goals comes at a time when EU member states are seeking to contain their budgetary contributions to the EU, especially with the departure of the UK, expected over the coming months.</p>
