      <p>New York City police detained two women for selling churros without licences at subway stations, sparking backlash from social media users and at least one city official.</p>
      <p>Officers can be seen in video captured Friday detaining a woman who was selling churros at a Brooklyn station. The bystander captures officers telling the woman she can turn over her cart and be fined or have it confiscated and face arrest.</p>
      <p>NYPD says the woman has received 10 summonses over the past six months for "unlicensed vending." She was handcuffed and then released with a ticket.</p>
      <p>Her cart was confiscated as "arrest evidence."</p>
      <p>The New York Daily News reports a second woman was arrested for selling churros Monday at another Brooklyn station. Police say they learned she had warrants for failing to appear in court for selling without a license.</p>
