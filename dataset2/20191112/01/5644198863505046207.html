      <p>LYON: An unusually strong earthquake hit southeastern France on Monday (Nov 11), injuring four people, one of them seriously, authorities said.</p>
      <p>A physicist at a geophysics institute the IPGP said that quakes of this strength are rare in that region, but warned of possible aftershocks and said people should leave fragile buildings.</p>

      <p>The quake, with a magnitude of 5.4, was felt in a vast area between the cities of Lyon and Montelimar which are about 150 kilometres apart, the national seismological office said.</p>
      <p>French utility EDF said it was carrying out regulatory checks at its Tricastin and Cruas nuclear power plants in the area to ensure there was no impact.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for EDF said the company's checks were precautionary and the reactors were functioning normally. He added that an unplanned outage at Tricastin's number 4 reactor earlier on Monday was unrelated to the quake.</p>
      <p>"I was leaning against the oven in my mother's bakery when I felt the tremor," said Victoria Brielle, a resident in Privas, some 25 kilometres from the quake's epicentre.</p>
      <p>"A customer said her sideboard had moved and all her crockery was broken," she said.</p>
      <p>Another resident in the area, Didier Levy, who lives in a 15th century castle, told AFP that "chandeliers were still trembling" several minutes after the quake.</p>
      <p>Levy, who said his dog starting barking even before humans felt the tremors, added: "I have never experienced anything like it, I could feel the trembling even though these wall are one metre thick."</p>
      <p>One person was seriously hurt when some scaffolding collapsed, the regional prefect's office said.</p>
      <p>Three other people in the neighbouring Ardeche region were slightly injured.</p>
      <p>Quakes in this region are rarely higher than Magnitude 5, said Mustapha Meghraoui of the IPGP's office in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>"We can say that this is a rare one," he added. But he said there might be an aftershock of around 4.5.</p>
      <p>"If people are in a fragile house, they would be better leaving it" for something more robust for a while, he said.</p>
      <p>The scale of the damage suggested the quake happened at a depth of between five and 10 kilometres, he added. But they were working on a more accurate reading.</p>
