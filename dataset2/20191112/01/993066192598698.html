      <p>SCHOOLS and youth organisations are being urged to empower young people to tackle bullying.</p>
      <p>Anti-Bullying Week 2019 features activities designed to teach children how to prevent physical, online and verbal abuse.</p>
      <p>Bullying has a significant impact on a child's life which can continue into adulthood.</p>
      <p>The week of events and activities will educate children about making small, simple changes, that can create a safe environment for everyone.</p>
      <p>The theme is Change Starts With Us, which highlights how everyone can take responsibility to achieve a more welcoming, tolerant and inclusive society.</p>
      <p>Activities include an arts competition in which children will create anti-bullying messages.</p>
      <p>Resources have also been created to show young people how to appreciate differences in the classroom and recognise the need to make adjustments to their attitudes about differences.</p>
      <p>They will also be taught how to respond to different bullying situations and understand how to be an "effective bystander".</p>
      <p>Gill Hassard from the National Children's Bureau said the week highlighted the issue of bullying to schools and the wider community.</p>
      <p>"Whether it is verbal, physical, online or in person, bullying has a significant impact on a child's life well into adulthood. By making small, simple changes, we can break this cycle and create a safe environment for everyone, where everyone is heard," she said.</p>
      <p>"This year's theme Change Starts With Us is about showing how we can all make changes to be part of the solution. Whether it is speaking to someone we trust when bullying happens or calling it out if we suspect it's happening to someone else, we can all work together for a solution."</p>
      <p>Orangefield PS in east Belfast has signed up take part in the campaign.</p>
      <p>Principal Sarah McCullagh said bullying is a major problem faced by many children in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>"As a school we have a duty of care to not only protect our pupils from incidences of bullying but to educate them as to the part they play in the prevention of it," she said.</p>
      <p>"All members of the school community must work together to provide our children with a safe, secure, caring and happy environment in which they are able to develop a love of learning and enjoy playing their part in school and society."</p>
      <p>:: Schools can download a free Anti-Bullying Week resource pack via www.endbullying.org.uk.</p>
