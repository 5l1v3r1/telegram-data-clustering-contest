An 'outsider' in his line of work, Jin Kang Ho is known to solve every case he's ever laid hands on, due to the fact that he's willing to use any means necessary - however dirty - to catch the criminal. </p>
      <p>Opposite Cha Tae Hyun, Lee Sun Bin will play the role of a TV program PD,<b> Kang Moo Young</b>. Her program deals with cases which were left unsolved even by the police. <br/><br/>OCN's 'Extra Detective', directed by <b>Kang Hyo Jin</b> of '<b>The Dude In Me</b>', '<b>Miss Wife</b>', and more, is set to air some time in early 2020. </p>
