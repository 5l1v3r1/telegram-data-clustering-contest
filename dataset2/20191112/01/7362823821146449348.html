      <p>The husband and son of Dawna Langford spoke out on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-citizens-killed-kidnapped-in-cartel-shootout-outside-northern-mexican-mormon-community-family">their family's tragedy</a> after members of a Mexican drug cartel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-citizens-killed-kidnapped-in-cartel-shootout-outside-northern-mexican-mormon-community-family">murdered her and other members of their family</a> on a Sonoran highway last week.</p>
      <p>Thirteen-year-old Devin Langford walked 14 miles from the site of the murders to get help, after hiding injured siblings, he and his father David <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">told Martha MacCallum</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>"I was just thinking of my mom and my siblings," he said, telling "<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/the-story">The Story</a>" he carried two siblings a short distance but had to stop.</p>
      <p>"We walked probably a couple yards -- probably 20 yards -- and then we got them behind a tree right there and they were really wounded so I started walking."</p>

      <p>His father told MacCallum he was in Arizona at the time of the massacre, calling the incident an "act of terrorism."</p>
      <p>"To me, this was an act of terrorism against our community," he said.</p>
      <p>"We're a small community but we're a quiet community that's been safe -- we've been there for over 60 years."</p>
      <p>Last week, at least six children and three women living in that faith-based community of U.S. citizens in <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a> were shot to death in the northern part of the country.</p>
      <p>Alfonso Durazo, Mexico's top security official, confirmed the six deaths, adding that six more children were wounded in the attack, with five transferred to hospitals in Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
      <p>On "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/the-story">The Story</a>," David Langford said members of his community have never had run-ins with law enforcement or the cartels.</p>

      <p>He added many members of his community near Bavispe have returned to the United States permanently, out of fear.</p>
      <p>"Most of them left with no intention of returning," he said.</p>
      <p>"There were a lot of heroes that night that risked their lives... to rescue my children," he continued, adding Devin is one of those heroes.</p>
