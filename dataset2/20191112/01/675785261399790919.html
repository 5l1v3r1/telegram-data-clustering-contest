      <p>Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola faced each other again the day after their titanic title-race showdown - this time at the annual UEFA Elite Coaches Forum.</p>
      <p>And Unai Emery was also among the Premier League bosses in attendance in Nyon on the day <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> chiefs gave the under-pressure manager a public show of support.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss Klopp and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> manager Guardiola have developed one of football's most fascinating duels, with the German having gained the upper hand on Sunday as his Reds side dismantled their chief title rivals in a 3-1 victory at Anfield.</p>
      <p>But on Monday they put their rivalry aside to share their views on the current state of football and how the game in Europe can be improved going forward.</p>
      <p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also due to attend the conference in Switzerland, as well as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> chief Zinedine Zidane, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> coach Maurizio Sarri, Ajax manager Erik ten Hag and PSG's Thomas Tuchel.</p>

      <p>Emery took a break from his Arsenal struggles to attend, with the Gunners' 2-0 defeat to top-four rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> at the weekend having intensified the pressure on the manager.</p>
      <p>The loss left Emery's side sixth in the Premier League, eight points behind fourth-placed City and facing an uphill struggle to qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>But Arsenal chiefs yesterday reiterated their support for Emery with a strong message to club staff, which read: “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season.</p>
      <p>"We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect.</p>

      <p>“Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place.</p>
      <p>"We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.”</p>
      <p>First staged in 1999, the UEFA Elite Coaches Forum sees some of the game's most successful coaches share their views with UEFA so that European football's governing body can incorporate their perspectives into UEFA's policy and decision-making.</p>
      <p>Other coaches due to attend were Maxi Allegri, Carlo Ancelotti, Paulo Fonseca, Rudi Garcia and Mircea Lucescu.</p>
