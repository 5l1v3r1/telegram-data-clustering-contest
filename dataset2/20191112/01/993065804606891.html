      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>The Irish News, November 12 2009: Ryan Cup quarter-final: University of Ulster, Jordanstown 2-10 University College, Dublin 1-9</p>
      <p>University of Ulster, Jordanstown turned in a brilliant display to overcome University College, Dublin in last night’s Ryan Cup quarter-final in St Patrick’s Park, Mayobridge. Played in atrocious conditions, with a strong breeze and heavy rain falling throughout, the game finished with water lying on the pitch, and it was a tribute to both teams that an exciting encounter took place.</p>
      <p>UUJ won this game the hard way. For 40 minutes they played with only 14 players after Armagh full-forward Stefan Forker received a straight red card.</p>
      <p>But in a sound UUJ defence, Colm Murney, Gerard McCartan and Monaghan’s Donal Morgan were outstanding. At midfield, the Monaghan duo of Shane Mulligan and Darren Hughes played their hearts out, especially in the second half when they faced the sleeting rain and strong breeze.</p>
      <p>The Jordanstown attack played some delightful football in the conditions, but poor finishing cost them vital scores, especially in the second half.</p>
      <p>The Tyrone trio of Kieran Donnelly, Peter Hughes and Jason McAnulla gave the UCD defence a testing time, and McAnulla’s two goals were the deciding scores in the game.</p>
      <p>UUJ: M McAllister; A Girvan, C Murney, G McCartan; K McGinley, D Morgan (0-1), C Bayne; S Mulligan, D Hughes (0-3); K Donnelly (0-4), M Gottchie, P Hughes (0-1); D McNulty, S Forker, J McAnulla (2-1)</p>
      <p>Red card: S Forker (20)</p>
      <p>UCD: M Savage; P Kelly, R O’Carroll, M Fitzsimons; R Maloney, D Curran, J Fitzpatrick; N Higgins (0-1), K O’Sullivan (0-2); N Corkery (0-1), F Magee (0-2), R Mallon (0-1); N Murray (0-1), J O’Loughlin, P Brady (1-1)</p>
