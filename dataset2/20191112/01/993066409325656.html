      <p>DOES this statue look familiar?</p>
      <p>A clear-out of a house in south Belfast has unearthed the discovery of an unusual Irish News ornament.</p>
      <p>Crossgar woman Margaret McCriskin found the statue of the paper boy clutching a copy of the newspaper in her late mother-in-law's house in the Ormeau Road area.</p>
      <p>The delivery boy, wearing blue trousers, green jacket and cap with copies of The Irish News under both arms, is believed to have been given to May McCriskin during the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Intrigued by the discovery, Mrs McCriskin sent in a photograph of the ornament to the Irish News.</p>
      <p>"We found it in my late mother-in-law's house a few years ago," she said.</p>
      <p>"Apparently someone brought it back for her when they were on holiday in Omeath in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>"She had a ritual of a Belfast bap and a copy of the Irish News every day, so I think that's why the statue was brought back for her."</p>
      <p>Ms McCriskin said it was a "lovely memento" to have and wondered if anyone else also had a similar statue.</p>
      <p>"It's unfortunate that there's some slight marks on the front, but it's still in one piece," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's lovely that she kept it and when she passed away it was the one thing that my husband insisted that he wanted to keep.</p>
      <p>"It's a lovely little memento."</p>
