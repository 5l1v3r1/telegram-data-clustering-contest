      <p>MADRID (AP) — French police have used pepper spray and batons to push back pro-Catalan independence protesters who blocked a major highway border pass between France and Spain.</p>
      <p>The police then began towing away vehicles and debris with the aim of reopening the road to traffic.</p>
      <p>The police action Tuesday led to some scuffles, and some protesters could be seen crying from the effects of the spray.</p>
      <p>Several hundred protesters remain gathered around La Jonquera crossing and Catalan regional police from Spain were standing by.</p>
      <p>The planned three-day protest started Monday. It was organized by a clandestine activist group called Tsunami Democratic, which has staged many protests, some violent, since a dozen Catalan separatist leaders were convicted last month for their role in a push to make Catalonia independent from Spain in 2017.</p>
