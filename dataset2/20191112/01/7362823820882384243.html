      <h1>Brigitte Nielsen claims she once slapped Madonna in 1987: 'She was very rude'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T01:10:49+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Day</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brigitte-nielsen-54-welcomes-her-5th-child">Brigitte Nielsen</a> didn't hold back when <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elton-john-slams-madonna-nasty-lady-gaga">Madonna</a> upset her years ago.</p>
      <p>The "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">Rocky IV</a>" star visited "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/marie-osmond-gwen-stefani-halloween">The Talk</a>" on Monday and dished on an encounter with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">Queen of Pop</a> that left her less than thrilled.</p>
      <p>"In 1987, I was in a club downtown with her and she kept stepping on my feet," Neilsen, 56, said. "She was very rude and I ended up giving her a slap across the face," the actress alleged.</p>

      <p>Neilsen remembered then being escorted out of the club.</p>
      <p>The revenge didn't stop there, however, according to Neilsen.</p>

      <p>"The best part is yet to come," Nielsen said before claiming: "a couple months later in the south of France, I got back at her for being rude, having a one-night stand with Sean Penn."</p>
      <p>Penn, 59, and Madonna, 61, were married for over four years in the '80s, according to <a href="https://people.com/music/madonna-sean-penn-marry-charity-art-basel/">People magazine</a>.</p>

      <p>The audience erupted into cheers as Neilsen held two thumbs up and wore a smile.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Madonna <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/madonna-sued-by-fan-starting-concerts-late">kept concertgoers waiting</a> for two hours beyond her show's scheduled start time, saying "a queen is never late."</p>
      <p>Nielsen slammed the comments, saying Madonna's disrespect for her fans was "ridiculous and uncalled for."</p>

      <p>"She's not the queen," Nielsen said.</p>
      <p>Reps for Madonna and Penn did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.</p>
