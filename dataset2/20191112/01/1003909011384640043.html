      <p>The Alberta government is reviewing how it funds agricultural research, a move some producer groups fear could mean less money for the scientists whose work helps to keep the province’s farms and ranches competitive.</p>
      <p>As part of the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/2019-alberta-budget-will-have-2-8-per-cent-spending-cut-programs-eliminated/wcm/07b84c0b-7753-4321-b175-e6870e6a490d">recently released provincial budget</a>, the UCP government indicated it would cut $34.1 million over four years from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry’s expenses by “transitioning to a framework of producer and industry-led research.” Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen said the government is looking to reform how it conducts research, and to attract more investment from the private sector.</p>
      <p>“Starting in December, we will consult with farmers to determine their research priorities and determine whether we should deliver research directly, or strategically fund it,” Dreeshen said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>Alberta is currently unique among Canadian provinces in that it employs its own internal scientists who work in the area of agricultural research, while also supporting agriculture research at universities and colleges. Other provinces do not have their own agricultural scientists, but simply fund research projects conducted at post-secondary or non-profit institutions.</p>
      <p>Farm groups also help to fund agricultural research, investing in specific studies and development programs through the use of check-off dollars paid by producers.</p>
      <p>Tom Steve, general manager for the Alberta Wheat and Alberta Barley commissions, said many farmers feel that under Rachel Notley’s NDP government, the province was directing more of its agricultural research dollars to its own areas of interest (such as climate change and sustainability) and less to research aimed at improving agricultural productivity (such as crop variety development and insect and pest management).</p>

      <p>“We as producer groups believe the focus needs to be on productivity,” Steve said. “So we welcome the fresh start in terms of the direction of policy.”</p>
      <p>However, Charlie Christie — chair of the Alberta Beef Producers — said farmers are fearful that “industry-led research” is another way of saying the UCP wants producers to pick up more of the tab. Christie said not only do producer groups themselves not have the budgets to make large investments in strategic research and development programs, but agricultural research loses its value if it’s solely funded by farmers.</p>
      <p>“We can be as non-biased as we possibly can, but it’s like a big company doing research for a product it’s selling . . . it looks like you planted the research to support your point of view,” he said.</p>
      <p>Christie added that now more than ever, the beef industry is facing pressure from environmental and animal welfare activists and relies on sound research not only to improve its own performance, but to answer to its critics.</p>
      <p>“To keep the industry competitive — on all the environmental, societal and financial aspects — and to be competitive in this world market that we’re in, we need government support,” Christie said. “More than just lip service. We need financial leverage dollars.”</p>
      <p>In 2018-19, Alberta Agriculture and Forestry spent an estimated $36 million on agriculture research through project grants and internal research, while annual reports of the farmer marketing boards and commissions indicate producers themselves invest approximately $8 million to $10 million annually on research.</p>
      <p>According to the provincial budget document, the government’s goal is to “maintain research capacity in the most cost-effective manner” and to “demonstrate how to focus research where needed at a lower cost.”</p>
