      <p>Earlier today (12 Nov), the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/homepage">Housing and Development Board (HDB)</a> launched its biggest Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) sales exercise with 8,170 flats up for sale.</p>
      <p>The launch comprises of 4,571 BTO flats in Tengah, Tampines, and Ang Mo Kio as well as 3,599 SBF units across various towns and estates – such as Bishan and Clementi.</p>
      <p>According to the HDB, the 4,571 BTO flats are spread across five projects. Most of the BTO flats are situated in the upcoming “forest town” of Tengah, spread across three housing projects, while the rest are in the mature estates of Ang Mo Kio and Tampines.</p>
      <p>In Tengah, a total of 3,460 units, range from two-room flexi to five-room flats, are being offered under three BTO projects – <i>Plantation Village</i>, <i>Plantation Grange</i>, and <i>Garden Vines @ Tengah</i>.</p>

      <p>There are also three-generation flats for sale. Prices start from S$110,000, excluding grants, for a two-room flexi flat and from S$442,000 for a three-generation flat. This is the third batch of Tengah flats to be launched.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Ang Mo Kio, the 450 units on sale range from two-room flexi to four-room flats and prices start from $145,000 for a two-room flexi. The project, called <i>Yio Chu Kang Beacon</i>, is next to Presbyterian High School and a short walk away from Yio Chu Kang MRT station.</p>

      <p>Not forgetting, the HDB noted that two of the three Tengah projects – <i>Plantation Village</i> and <i>Plantation Grange</i> – will have shorter-waiting times, where at least 95% of the four-room and bigger flats will be set aside for first-timer families.</p>
      <p>This marks a 10% increase from the current quota of at least 85% in non-mature estates.</p>
      <p>The HDB added that the new flats’ prices will take into account factors such as location, flat attributes, and prevailing market conditions.</p>
      <p>Eligible first-timer families can enjoy the new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) of up to S$80,000. With EHG, flat buyers could pay as little as S$30,000 for a 2-room Flexi flat, S$133,000 for a 3-room flat, S$242,000 for a 4-room flat, and S$364,000 for a 5-room flat.</p>
      <p>Applications for the flats can be made on the <a href="https://esales.hdb.gov.sg/bp25/launch/19nov/bto/19NOVSBF_page_7523/home.html">HDB website</a> starting from today until next Monday (18 Nov).</p>
      <p>Not forgetting, the HDB also revealed that the next sales launch will be in February 2020, with about 3,000 BTO flats in Sembawang and Toa Payoh.</p>
      <p>The HDB will also be releasing another 3,700 BTO flats in Choa Chu Kang, Tengah, Pasir Ris, and Tampines in May 2020.</p>
