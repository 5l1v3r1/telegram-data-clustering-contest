      <h1>Future of shipyard more secure after suitors InfraStrata raise £6m</h1>

      <p>BELFAST shipyard's future is seemingly more secure after a purchase deal by London-based InfraStrata moved a step closer yesterday.</p>
      <p>The energy firm has agreed a conditional contract and aims to complete the £6m acquisition by December 5, according to administrators Michael Jennings and Brian Murphy from BDO.</p>
      <p>They were appointed on August 6 to run Harland &amp; Wolff Group Plc and Harland &amp; Wolff Heavy Industries Ltd after its Norwegian parent company collapsed, putting 120 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>InfraStrata - which is currently planning a gas storage facility at Islandmagee - revealed on Sunday that had commenced an accelerated book-build - a process often used when a company is in immediate need of financing - to raise £6 million.</p>
      <p>Yesterday its chief executive John Wood said: “We are very pleased with the result of the placing bookbuild as this will provides us with the necessary capital to complete the acquisition of the Harland and Wolff assets.”</p>
      <p>InfraStrata will initially focus on metal fabrication for its energy projects.</p>
      <p>Mr Wood added: “The company is now on the cusp of a transformational change. Along with the cost savings that will accrue to the Islandmagee gas storage project, this multi-purpose fabrication facility in the heart of Belfast is expected to provide multiple revenue streams.</p>
      <p>“Upon completion of the acquisition, we will seek to enter into contracts as soon as possible with a view to kick-starting revenue generation, which will be a significant milestone in our history.</p>
      <p>“We are bullish about the acquisition as it provides immediate and near-term revenue generating opportunities as well as significantly increasing the value of the company's balance sheet.”</p>
      <p>Administrators BDO said: “Following the entering of heads of terms on October 1, Harland &amp; Wolff has entered into a conditional contract with InfraStrata with the intent of completing a sale by December 5, and if it doesn't occur by this target date, completion of the acquisition may be extended to January 7</p>
      <p>“The agreed terms of sale include the transfer of the remaining employees on their existing terms and conditions to the purchaser therefore protecting and safeguarding the employment of the workforce.</p>
      <p>“The purchaser has also agreed to fund the ongoing running costs of the shipyard for November and December if the completion date is extended.”</p>
      <p>The team at BDO has been involved in the sale process for more than a year, and expressed its thanks to the staff at Harland &amp; Wolff as well as to the Unite and GMB unions.</p>
      <p>They said: “At all times we have been conscious of the important role Harland &amp; Wolff plays in our economy and we believe a patient, cooperative and collaborative approach with all stakeholders has helped to positively progress matters to this stage and hopefully secure completion of this deal in the coming weeks.”</p>
