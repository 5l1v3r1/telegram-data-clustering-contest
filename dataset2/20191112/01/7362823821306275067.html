      <p>"Our hearts are so full," the post continued. "We are so thankful for God blessings us with such a healthy baby girl!"</p>
      <p>Lauren's miscarriage was revealed in February, which she said occurred after she began feeling sick.</p>

      <p>“I was cramping really, really bad, which was quite strange because I normally don’t," Lauren told <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/02/11/josiah-and-lauren-duggar-suffer-miscarriage/">Page Six</a>. "I was thinking maybe I had something that had gluten in it. That’s what I was thinking. Well, it was late at night and I went to use the restroom and right there was the baby. Gone.”</p>
      <p>Three months later, Lauren, 27, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/josiah-lauren-duggar-expecting-baby-after-miscarriage">shared the happy news that she was pregnant again</a>.</p>

      <p>"We are so excited to announce that baby #2 is on the way," the post read. "It's hard to fully express just how grateful we are for God blessing us again with another precious gift! So, as we rejoice in the life of our second sweet baby, we also remember... our other sweet baby, Asa, in heaven. Good is so incredibly good!"</p>
