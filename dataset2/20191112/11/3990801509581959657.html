      <h1>Microsoft pledges to honor California’s CCPA privacy law across the US</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:19:31+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ravie/" target="_blank">Ravie Lakshmanan</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft has pledged to honor California‘s landmark digital privacy law across the entire US.</p>
      <p>“Our approach to privacy starts with the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right and includes our commitment to provide robust protection for every individual,” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/11/microsoft-california-privacy-rights/">Microsoft’s chief privacy officer Julie Brill said</a>.</p>
      <p>Called the <a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/facts">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA), the law emulates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">EU GDPR framework</a> to protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">privacy of California’s citizens</a>. It compels companies to be more transparent in the way they collect and use their customers’ data, and gives users more control over their personal information, particularly when being sold.</p>
      <p>In addition to offering opt-outs, the companies must be able to delete any data it holds about a customer upon request. And just like the GDPR, companies found to be breaching the CCPA could be fined up to $2,500 per violation or up to $7,500 if it’s clear the violation was intentional.</p>
      <p>Although the CCPA is expected to go into effect on January 1, 2020, exactly what’s required of the companies to abide by the regulations is still being developed.</p>
      <p>Brill said Microsoft — which has data collecting products like Edge browser, Cortana, Windows, Bing, Skype, and Xbox Live — will continue to monitor any enforcement changes, and make appropriate adjustments to meet the new transparency and control requirements under the CCPA.</p>
      <h3>The need for a national data privacy law</h3>
      <p>The CCPA is no doubt the most sweeping privacy law in the US. But it’s also likely to make companies wade through a legal minefield that would force them to yield to a patchwork of discrete privacy laws as opposed to one federal regulation, making compliance extremely onerous and expensive.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, efforts to pass a federal privacy law have made little progress in the US, with lawmakers disagreeing over issues like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-privacy/u-s-online-privacy-rules-unlikely-this-year-hurting-big-tech-idUSKBN1WF1B1">whether the bill should preempt state rules</a>.</p>
      <p>The fact that Microsoft is treating the state law as a federal legislation is telling. But then again, the tech giant may have had it easy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-privacy-microsoft/microsoft-says-it-will-follow-californias-digital-privacy-law-in-us-idUSKBN1XL2EO">According to Reuters</a>, “it may be easier for Microsoft than other tech platforms to comply with California‘s privacy laws because much of Microsoft‘s business can qualify as a ‘service provider'” — a type of business that is given special treatment under the CCPA.</p>
      <p>But in the absence of a federal law, it won’t be altogether surprising if the <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/10/03/no-federal-privacy-law-will-make-it-in-the-us-this-year-sources-say/">CCPA turns out to be the ipso facto privacy rule</a> of the land.</p>
