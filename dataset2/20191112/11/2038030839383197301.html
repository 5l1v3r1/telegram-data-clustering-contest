      <p>Cape Town – Alec Baldwin’s wife recently suffered another miscarriage – less than two months after <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/five-months-after-their-miscarriage-alec-and-hilaria-baldwin-are-pregnant-with-baby-no-5-20190919"><b>announcing the couple was expecting</b></a> their fifth child.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4vxXYin6v0/"><b>Instagram</b></a> to share the video she sent to Alec, letting him know the news. On the post, she wrote, "We are very sad to share that today we learned that our baby passed away at four months. We also want you to know that even though we are not ok right now, we will be.</p>
      <p>"We are so lucky with our four healthy babies—and we will never lose sight of this," she continued.</p>
      <p>Understandably, Hilaria said she's "devastated" at the news and asked for privacy at this difficult time.</p>

      <p>Previously, in April, the health and wellness expert revealed she'd had a miscarriage when they were expecting. "There was no heartbeat today at my scan... so it's over," she wrote on Instagram.</p>
      <p>"But I have some pretty strong and amazing heartbeats right here," she captioned a photo on Instagram of herself, Alec and their four healthy babies.  </p>
