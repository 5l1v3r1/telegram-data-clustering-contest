      <p>SUFFOLK COUNTY (WABC) -- Former Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota is set to face trial Tuesday on a string of federal charges.</p>
      <p>Spota and a former top aide are charged with <a href="https://abc7ny.com/suffolk-county-da-thomas-spota-aide-charged-in-cover-up/2566646/">interfering in an investigation</a> into the former Suffolk County police chief.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say they tried to cover up the beating of a drug addict who stole a duffel bag from an unmarked police vehicle in front of then Suffolk Police Chief James Burke's home.</p>
      <p>Burke pleaded guilty to the beating and was released from prison last year.</p>
