      <p>It's worth noting that one of the games prominently <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-app-play-store-red-dead-2-borderlands-3-cyberpunk-2077">featured in the Stadia app</a> that landed in the Play Store a few days ago was Borderlands 3, which won't be available at launch. Cyberpunk 2077 was featured on the app as well and isn't seen on either lists. At launch, Stadia will only be available for Founder's Pack or Premiere Edition users and includes a three-month Stadia Pro subscription, Chromecast Ultra, and Google Stadia Controller. The Pro subscription for $10 monthly will launch at a later date. The free Stadia Base service will launch in 2020.</p>
