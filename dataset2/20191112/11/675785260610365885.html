      <h2>Harley Bond, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, forgot his parents after suffering from a rare type of childhood dementia which can cause permanent brain damage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:40:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Dan Coles, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A five-year-old boy with a rare type of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dementia">dementia</a> can finally recognise his parents again.</p>
      <p>Harley Bond forgot his mum and dad after he was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome when he was just three.</p>
      <p>The type of life-limiting dementia, which can cause permanent brain damage, is extremely rare.</p>
      <p>Parents Wayne Bond, 47, and Emma Siddal, 38, were heartbroken after Harley's health declined.</p>
      <p>But he's now had a device implanted in his head to help him recover.</p>
      <p>"Before the trial started, Harley was just getting worse but since he has been on it, he has remembered words he could no longer say, he recognises us as mum and dad and the condition seems to of stabilised," Wayne said.</p>

      <p>"We have good and bad days, but we’re cherishing the time we have with him and hopefully the treatment will work, and we’ll have him for many more years to come.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes he forgets who we are and it’s awful, but we always remain strong and it’s made our family a unit of strength because we have been through it all and remain resilient together."</p>
      <p>The device releases small quantities of the enzyme that is missing that causes his symptoms to get worse.</p>
      <p>Harley, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is one of just 22 children who have used or are using this trial worldwide.</p>

      <p>Emma, a full-time carer, said: "It was heartbreaking in the months he couldn’t recognise us, he struggled to make eye contact with us, and didn’t call us mum and dad.</p>
      <p>"The trial is doing well, and it’s really giving us a little bit of hope for the future, getting on it was potluck and we’re happy he is responding well.</p>
      <p>"We realise, however, that it won’t cure him, but it might give us a few extra precious years with our brave son.</p>

      <p>"We are so proud of everything out little boy is achieving, we thought he would just get worse but he seems to be improving very slightly in some cases.</p>
      <p>"He’s such a strong lad, and he gives us glimpses of his personality when he can, which we love."</p>
      <p>Harley was diagnosed with Sanfilippo Syndrome type B, in 2016.</p>
      <p>Despite him developing well in the first few months of his life, his parents started to worry as he kept getting infections and colds, and his speech started to go backwards when he was three.</p>

      <p>The youngster would stop breathing momentarily during the night, after developing sleep apnoea as a result of the condition - and as he lost the ability to know what was safe to eat, his family had to look after his as though he were a baby, trying to eat plants, bushes, and rocks.</p>
      <p>But after hearing about a clinical trial, Harley's family put him forward for the experimental treatment in 2017.</p>
      <p>Wayne said: "He was born completely fine and developing well, but then everything changed.</p>

      <p>"He was really boisterous with other kids and his nose was always runny, he kept getting infections and started to lose his speech.</p>
      <p>"When he went to the park, or was with other kids, we knew there was something up because he just didn’t act like everyone else, he was really boisterous.</p>
      <p>"He couldn’t remember simple things like knowing how to use the toilet or what was food and what was not."</p>
      <p>The trial is being offered by US pharmaceutical companies and is an enzyme replacement therapy which delivers the missing enzyme directly to the brain thus bypassing the blood-brain barrier.</p>

      <p>"The hospital spoke to us about option and let us know about this new trial, but they told us he would need to do a year of studying to assess his memory," Wayne added.</p>
      <p>"Luckily his memory was good enough to be able to get onto the trial, he could remember enough of what he was told to show there was hope he could be saved.</p>
      <p>"It was going well but then he had a bad patch for a few months, he didn’t know who we were and couldn’t even call us mummy or daddy, the whole thing is soul destroying because we're looking at our little boy and he’s dying.</p>
      <p>"We try to do everything we can to stay positive and being mentally positive is the hardest part, kids with this syndrome don’t make it to adulthood so we know we just have to enjoy the time we have with him.</p>
      <p>"Knowing that our son has dementia was hard to even comprehend, but that’s why it’s so important that everyone starts to know that it is possible and that it isn’t just older people this disease can effect.</p>

      <p>"With the clinical trial he is on, he has good days and bad says but naturally this condition is supposed to just get worse and worse, which isn’t the case with Harley, sometimes he’s completely in control of himself but other days he can’t move."</p>
      <p>Harley's treatment is completed at Great Ormond Street hospital, they facilitate the device, track his progress and keep on top of his condition.</p>
      <p>He still suffers with a multitude of difficulties but hasn’t let it get in the way of him being a kid.</p>
      <p>The CEO of one drug giant Allievex, which is one half of the firm running the trials, Thomas Mathers, explained: "In general Sanfilippo is a disorder, and in these children, they have a genetic mutation which stops them from being able to produce a certain enzyme that they need otherwise their neurons will be killed off.</p>
      <p>"We have a device that is implanted into the child’s head which releases a synthetic version of the missing enzyme directly into the brain that washes the sugar build up which causes the neurons to be killed."</p>
