      <h1>Romain Perraud lifts lid on Celtic transfer KO as he claims Nice played hardball over Hoops move</h1>
      <h2>The 22-year-old plumped for a switch to Brest but admits a move to Glasgow became a non-starter.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:35:06+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/">Celtic</a> target Romain Perraud has claimed Nice blocked his chance to move to Glasgow this summer.</p>
      <p>The left-back previously stated it was the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> champions who called time on their pursuit but has now hinted Nice were never keen to do a deal with the Hoops.</p>
      <p>And the 22-year-old plumped for a switch to Brest after also receiving an offer from Dijon once it became apparent his time on the French Riviera was coming to an end.</p>
      <p>Celtic moved to address their need for a left-back reinforcements after landing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boli-bolingoli-mbombo">Boli Bolingoli</a> in a £3m deal from Rapid Vienna. They further bolstered their options by signing Greg Taylor on deadline day.</p>

      <p>The Hoops' deal for Scotland international Taylor came after star turn <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> joined Arsenal for £25m.</p>
      <p>But Perraud insists the Hoops were in the mix before becoming aware of Nice's hardline stance.</p>
      <p>He told Goal: "Celtic and Dijon made me concrete offers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"With Celtic, the discussions started at the beginning of the transfer window, but Nice did not want to hear anything, so they did not come back.</p>
      <p>"There remained Dijon and Brest. In the end, I chose Brest. I was seduced by the project and the speech I received."</p>
