        <i>Video game adaptation seeks to quell furore generated by initial trailer which disappointed fans</i>
      </p>
      <p>A new trailer for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> movie has been released, after the film’s director assured fans of the game that the character would be redesigned after a tide of criticism greeted the first release.</p>
      <p>The initial trailer was released in April, featuring star Jim Carrey as Dr Eggman alongside the CGI-animated hedgehog, but was met with considerable derision. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/30/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer">The Guardian’s Keith Stuart</a> described it as “a 200mph slap in the face” and said the central character “resembles a cheap knock-off Sonic toy your child might win at a fairground stand and then be terrified of”. The character’s human-style <a href="https://uproxx.com/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-trailer-reactions-teeth/">teeth drew particular flak</a> on social media.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/03/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer-criticism">Jeff Fowler, the film’s director, later tweeted</a>: “The message is loud and clear... you aren’t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It’s going to happen.”</p>
      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog has been in development as a movie since Hollywood studio Sony acquired the adaptation rights in 2013. However, it failed to get a project off the ground, and the rights passed to Paramount in 2017. The film is due for release in November.</p>
