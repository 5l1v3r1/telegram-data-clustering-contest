      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- The New York City Department of Sanitation has issued a Snow Alert for Tuesday.</p>
      <p>City officials say they are most concerned about the cold front and drop in temperatures that will come following rain Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Despite no expected accumulation, the sanitation department has prepared for there to be an event and will have salt spreaders on standby and ready to go.</p>
      <p>During a snow alert, DSNY coordinates with NYC Emergency Management and the Department of Transportation on snow clearing protocol in accordance with each agency's written snow plan.</p>
      <p>"With the potential for the first snowfall of the season and the cold weather to follow, you may experience slippery road conditions on Tuesday. We encourage New Yorkers to allow for extra travel time and exercise caution during your commutes," said NYC Emergency Management Commissioner Deanne Criswell. "The temperatures will also drop drastically; be sure to bundle up, and remember to check on your friends and loved one who may need help during the cold weather."</p>
      <p><a href="https://abc7ny.com/weather/accuweather-alert-bitter-cold-to-grip-nyc-area/27410/">An AccuWeather Alert has been issued</a> for Tuesday as the coldest air of the season arrives. Some rain along the cold front may end as snow in the afternoon as temperatures tumble.</p>
      <p>While the snow should not amount to much more than a coating in the city, areas to the north and west in the higher elevations could get an inch or two.</p>
      <p>Arctic air will move in Tuesday night, with record cold possible by Wednesday morning.</p>
