      <h1>Lula’s Free. Now What ?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:00:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Carol Pires</a></address>
      <p>SÃO PAULO, Brazil — The former president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/world/americas/lula-brazil-supreme-court.html?module=inline">released</a> last Friday after a year and a half in prison. Mr. da Silva, who is still facing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/09/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-da-silva.html?module=inline">pending charges</a>, could well find himself back in prison, but for now he will be able to remain free until all his appeals are exhausted. Given the unpopularity of the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, the liberation of the most beloved and hated man in Brazil threatens to further deepen political tension.</p>
      <p>The Worker’s Party has floundered since Mr. da Silva <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/es/2018/04/07/prision-lula-condena-curitiba/?module=inline">was imprisoned</a> in April 2018. And yet no other politician has managed to come to the fore while in prison as he has. With his charismatic rhetoric and his track record as one of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/da11de16-d4a0-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77">most popular presidents</a> in Brazilian history, he remains the only opposition figure capable of mobilizing the masses.</p>
      <p>Paradoxically, until now the only opposition Mr. Bolsonaro’s presidency has faced has come largely from within his own party. Mr. da Silva and his allies hope to invigorate the Workers’ Party — the country’s most important opposition force. Now that he is free, the party can focus its efforts on counterbalancing Mr. Bolsonaro, the extreme right former senator elected last year.</p>
      <p>Mr. da Silva <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-poll/brazil-poll-shows-jailed-lula-extending-lead-for-october-election-idUSKCN1L51J3">remained a front-runner</a> in the 2018 presidential election even after he was jailed. When his impending release was announced this past Friday, hundreds of supporters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/08/lula-brazil-released-prison-supreme-court-ruling">stood outside</a> the federal police building in Curitiba, the capital of Paraná, celebrating. The following day in São Paulo, just as on the day he was imprisoned, thousands of people gathered at the Metalworkers’ Union, where Lula began his career as a union leader in the 1970s. “I’m back,” he said. “I have more will to fight than when I left here.”</p>
      <p>Mr. da Silva cannot run for office unless his criminal convictions are overturned. But he will nonetheless make up for lost time by embarking on a tour across the country, re-establishing his place in Brazilian politics. His release will further ignite the polarization that Brazil has experienced over the past five years.</p>
      <p>Unable to remain silent, Mr. Bolsonaro took to Twitter after the leftist leader was released, <a href="https://twitter.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1193129840679047169?lang=en">saying</a>: “Don’t give ammunition to the scoundrel, who is momentarily free but full of guilt.” Mr. da Silva in turn <a href="https://www.poder360.com.br/governo/lula-acusa-bolsonaro-de-governar-para-milicia-e-promete-caravanas-pelo-pais/">said</a> that the country was governed by the paramilitaries.</p>
      <p>Many Brazilians who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro in 2018 are firmly against the Workers’ Party, and are staunch supporters of Operation Lava Jato — the wide-ranging corruption investigation that began in 2014 — but polls show that a many of them are unhappy with the current situation: Mr. Bolsonaro’s <a href="https://www.jota.info/paywall?redirect_to=//www.jota.info/dados/aprovacao-dos-presidentes/bolsonaro-tem-o-pior-primeiro-ano-04102019">32 percent approval rating</a> is the lowest of any president since 1987.</p>
      <p>Even so, others are angry about Mr. da Silva’s newfound freedom. His incarceration was, in large part, a response to the popular dissatisfaction with longtime and systemic impunity. For those, his release has meant losing the battle against corruption.</p>
      <p>Now, with a clear enemy walking free, Mr. Bolsonaro can divert attention from successive mistakes — from his inability to control the fires that recently ravaged large parts of the Amazon to his embarrassing offenses against world leaders — and retake his anti-corruption rhetoric. His anti-corruption drive, though, has been tainted by revelations of shady dealings within his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/es/2019/01/25/bolsonaro-corrupcion-brasil/?module=inline">family</a> and his <a href="https://www.efe.com/efe/america/politica/las-sospechas-por-fraude-electoral-se-ciernen-sobre-el-partido-de-bolsonaro/20000035-4087542">party</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/bolivia-evo-morales.html?module=inline">Latin America is gripped</a> by discontent and unrest, as shown by the protests in Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador. Both the government and its opposition must tread carefully with their belligerent discourses. Although it may be naïve to think that both sides will opt for the path of conciliation and unity that Brazil so desperately needs, both Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bolsonaro should make an attempt: it is of utmost importance to start to mitigate the extremism that has corroded democracy in the country and the region.</p>
      <p>The fact that Mr. Bolsonaro has met his oppositional match is a good thing. But the cult of personality, which both leaders exemplify, is an unfortunate trait in Latin American politics. It must end.</p>
      <p>Mr. da Silva, 74, who has dominated the Brazilian political arena for the last 16 years, has impeded generational replacement within the Brazilian left and <a href="https://epoca.globo.com/guilherme-amado/psb-pdt-rede-pv-negociam-alianca-pra-eleicoes-de-prefeito-24068353">center left</a>. It will now be even more difficult to identify new leadership capable of tackling the far-right discourse. What Brazil needs most now is to shake off the cult of personality that has caused a toxic dependence on politics that revolves around the same cast of characters.</p>
      <p>Now with Mr. da Silva’s release, the ideal of a country that is more united and democratic, and less autocratic, seems further than ever.</p>
