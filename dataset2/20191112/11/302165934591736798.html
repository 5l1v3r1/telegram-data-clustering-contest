      <p>BERLIN, Nov 12 — German Chancellor Angela Merkel said today that she expected Britain’s parliament to approve British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s divorce deal with the European Union.</p>
      <p>The United Kingdom voted by 52 per cent-48 per cent in 2016 to quit the EU, albeit without deciding how it would be done. Parliament, however, has been deadlocked since a 2017 snap election over how, when and even whether to leave.</p>
      <p>Johnson, who had promised to deliver Brexit on October 31 “do or die”, demanded a December 12 election after parliament — where he has no majority — frustrated his attempts to ratify the last-minute divorce deal he struck with the EU in October.</p>
      <p>“I give this treaty a very, very big chance of being agreed to in Britain too and that would be good for all of us,” Merkel told a business event in Berlin.</p>
      <p>Johnson on Monday won the most significant boost of the election campaign to date when Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party pulled out of 317 Conservative-held seats in a bid to prevent opponents of Brexit controlling the next parliament.</p>
      <p>The move dramatically increases the chances that Johnson will stay as prime minister before finally delivering on the 2016 referendum result to take Britain out of the European Union. — Reuters</p>
