      </p>
      <p>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Tuesday recommended <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAeic8"><b>President's rule in the state</b></a>. As per a statement tweeted by Koshyari's office, "He is satisfied that the government cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution, (and therefore) has today submitted a report as contemplated by provision of Article 356 of the Constitution."

        <b>Govt can hold <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/5g-spectrum">5G spectrum </a>auction, but older telcos unlikely to bid: COAI</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the telecom industry body COAI, <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAeiYp"><b>the government is well within its rights to hold spectrum auction</b></a> in the current financial year if it so desires, but old operators, reeling under the impact of the SC ruling on statutory dues, are unlikely to participate. "The government can hold the auction if it wants, the larger question is who will turn up for bidding given the present financial situation," COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said. Mathews said given the latest AGR judgement from the apex court and the sector's deep crisis, the older operators are unlikely to have the wherewithal to bid for spectrum. DoT is also now mulling whether the apex court order also impacts any other company which uses spectrum or has a licence.</p>

The company said its Saldanha unit had lost its competitive cost advantage to compete in the export market, "mainly due to raw material and regulated prices", the company said in a statement. The South African government has expressed "disappointment" at the decision of ArcelorMittal South Africa (AMSA) to retrench nearly 1,000 workers across the company and to shut down its operations in Saldanha town.</p>
