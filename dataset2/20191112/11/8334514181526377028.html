      <p>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch state said on Tuesday it will appeal against a court ruling ordering it to take back dozens of young children of mothers who joined Islamic State in Syria.</p>
      <p>A court in The Hague said on Monday the government must actively help repatriate 56 children living in poor conditions in camps in Syria.</p>
      <p>The Dutch foreign and justice ministers both issued statements saying they would seek to overturn the courtâ€™s decision, which they said did not take diplomatic considerations into account.</p>
