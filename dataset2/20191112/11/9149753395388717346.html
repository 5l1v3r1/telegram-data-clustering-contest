      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order datamine uncovers a familiar face, double-bladed lightsabers and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:42:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p>EA isn't offering early access to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-release-date/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> over fears of spoilers, but it hasn't ended up making a difference—dataminers have still managed to root around in the game files and discover plenty, including some story spoilers, so if you want to go in fresh, turn back now!</p>
      <p>Collected on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/dux0ym/jedi_fallen_order_gameplay_force_powers_and/">Reddit</a> by TheMastersSkywalker, the leaks include a <a href="https://streamable.com/l2xfg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">video</a> showing off Cal's combat skills and Force powers, some of which we've seen before. You can see a <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/566391902610522113/643519196923428875/unknown.png">list of Cal's moves</a>, from leaps and evades to deflecting blaster bolts. He can also get his hands on a double-bladed lightsaber, which he'll be able to switch to mid-combo. </p>
      <p>On his galactic jaunt, Cal will visit Bogano, Zeffo, Kashyyyk, Dathomir, a fight club on Umbara and the Inquisitor fortress at Ilum. While most of the levels will let you explore the planet a bit, the Umbara and Ilum are the exceptions. Bogano and Zeffo were made specifically for the game, but the rest of the planets have appeared before. </p>
      <p>Kashyyyk is, of course, the home of the wookies; Dathomir is where both Darth Maul and Asaj Ventress come from, as well as rancors; Umbara is a world without a sun, previously appearing in The Clone Wars; and finally there's Ilum, a frosty world that's conveniently full of lightsaber crystals. </p>
      <p>It looks like Darth Vader will be popping in to say hello. You can see the big bad Sith Lord's files <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/643505641368846357/643524002395979776/unknown.png">here</a>. It's not a surprise that Darth Vader might have an interest in one of the last Jedi, and in one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cal-kestis-gets-a-little-help-from-his-friends-in-the-new-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-trailer/">trailers</a> you can hear him breathing, but aside form that tease, Respawn's kept his appearance under wraps.</p>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is due out on November 15, but more details are likely to slip out before then.</p>
