      <p>Today saw Ubisoft unleash a massive 7GB update for Tom Clancy’s <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/ghost-recon">Ghost Recon</a> Breakpoint. We’re well aware that the game has some issues, and this patch gets right to work addressing quite a lot of them. The update brings the game up to version 1.0.3.</p>
      <p>The changelog is extensive, so if you plan to read through all of it, make sure you’re sitting somewhere comfortable. Everything from player stamina, to weapon swapping, has been tweaked. Of course, there are PC specific fixes too, improving controls, menu navigation, and more.</p>
      <p>Simple gameplay fixes include improvements to the AI behaviour, especially in scenes where the AI has been every bit artificial, but lacking in the intelligence part.</p>
