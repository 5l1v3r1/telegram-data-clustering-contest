      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FrankLampard">Frank Lampard</a> has hinted at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/reece-james">Reece James</a> playing in midfield in the future after the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chelsea-fc-0">Chelsea</a> youngster's impressive full Premier League debut against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old performed admirably at right-back in place of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Cesar_Azpilicueta">Cesar Azpilicueta</a>, enjoying great success up against Wilfried Zaha.</p>
      <p>And Lampard has hailed the youngster and predicted a future for him in midfield as well as his preferred right-back role.</p>
      <p>"Right-back would be his favoured position," Lampard claimed. "Whether it be there, right wing-back or right of a three.</p>
      <p>"As he’s coming into the team, you’d see him there but he does have that all-round game that he could handle playing centrally in midfield if needs be.</p>
      <p>"At the moment we’ve got good players in there who are used to playing in there anyway, but he could always do that as he matures through his career."</p>
      <p>Lampard now has a selection headache for after the international break.</p>
      <p>He could bring Azpilicueta back in, or utilise James as an extra man in midfield against the Premier League champions Man City, who sit a point behind the Blues after defeat to Liverpool.</p>
