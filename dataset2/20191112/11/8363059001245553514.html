      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 Leaks Point to a Whole Load of New Colours, 108MP Camera, and Bigger Screen</h1>

      <p>The dust has settled from the Note 10 launch so now it's time for the leaks to pour in so the S11, and there are a fair few of them.</p>
      <p>It looks like we'll be getting a slew of colours with next year's lineup, and black and white will be absent from some of the models altogether. According to leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1193770335214063617">Ishan Agarwal</a>, the Galaxy S11 will be launch in blue, grey and black, with the possibility of more colourways, but these three variants "at least". The S11e meanwhile will see handsets in blue, grey, and pink.</p>
      <p>He also has the lowdown on colours for the S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite, with the former being available in black, blue, and white, and the Note 10 Lite seeing red, silver, black, and "possibly aura" shades. That's a pretty colourful lineup, bolstered by new Galaxy buds that are reportedly in development which will release in blue, pink, black, and white.</p>
      <p>On top of uber-important tech news like what colour the phone you're possibly going to get will be, before you hide it away in a phone case, never to gaze upon it again, are a couple more, less important titbits, like the 108MP camera, and hole punch centred in the larger screens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-galaxy-phone-108mp-camera/">XDA</a> and leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1191232782661382145">Ice Universe</a> both report that the Galaxy S11 will most likely sport a 108MP camera, which will be a step up for S series. When it comes to the display, leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1192975629148475393">Evan Blass</a> says there'll be three screen sizes: either a 6.2-inch or 6.4-inch screen for the base model, a 6.7-inch Galaxy S11+ – both LTE and 5G variants – and a 6.9-inch Galaxy S11 5G.</p>
      <p>The good news is that you'll get to enjoy the majority of the screen with the centred hole punch, front-facing camera, which will be less obtrusive than the Note 10's, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1193877930452996098">Ice Universe</a>.</p>
      <p>Last week, we heard that <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/early-galaxy-s11-leaks-suggest-samsung-is-going-huge-on-battery/">Samsung is going big on the battery for the Galaxy S11</a>, using all that extra juice for 120Hz displays, if the leaks are to be believed.</p>
      <p>We're still a few months away from any official word on Samsung's next flagship, but if the leaks are as free-flowing as they were with the Note 10, we'll no doubt have the specs and pricing well before launch.
