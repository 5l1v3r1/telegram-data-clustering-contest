      <p>Parts of KwaZulu-Natal can expect severe thunderstorms that may lead to flooding later on Tuesday afternoon and evening, according to the South African Weather Service (SAWS).</p>
      <p>"Later this week, we are also expecting more rainfall and flooding in parts of the province. We are looking at Thursday and Friday," forecaster Mbavhi Maliage told News24.</p>
      <p>The eThekwini municipality said two people had reportedly died due to the inclement conditions.</p>
      <p>Disaster management teams in the province have been on high alert since Sunday, following reports of severe thunderstorms.</p>
      <p>Teams were placed on alert after SAWS indicated a strong possibility of severe thunderstorms that could lead to flooding in large parts of the province.</p>
      <p>eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda was on Tuesday expected to visit families who were affected by flooding and heavy rains in Durban.</p>
      <p>Maliage said there were places in the eastern parts of Limpopo, especially in the Lowveld, which had experienced flooding on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Thunderstorms in the region were expected to clear later in the day.</p>
      <p>More rainfall was also expected over parts of the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, with Maliage saying those along the coastal regions of the Western Cape should watch for flooding.</p>
