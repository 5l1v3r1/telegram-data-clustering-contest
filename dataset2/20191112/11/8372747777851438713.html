      <p>PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. â€“ The police chief of an Oklahoma town was found dead during a training retreat in Florida. The suspect? One of his officers.</p>
      <p>The body of Chief Lucky Miller of Mannford was discovered in a hotel room on Pensacola Beach, the Escambia County Sheriff's Office said.</p>
      <p>Mannford Officer Michael Nealey, 49, was arrested and will be charged with homicide, the office said.</p>
      <p>Deputies found the body in the men's hotel room after responding to a call about a fight Sunday night, sheriff's spokesperson Amber Southard told CNN.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what led to the fight, and officials have not released a cause of death.</p>
      <p>Miller, 44, was chief of police since 2007. He had a wife and three children.</p>
      <p>"We are heartbroken by the news," Mannford Mayor Tyler Buttram said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofMannford/photos/a.918682784903636/2269110389860862/?type=3&amp;theater">in a Facebook post.</a> "Please keep both families in your prayers as we work to move forward."</p>
      <p>Nealey is being held without bond at the Escambia County Jail. He has a court appearance scheduled for December 5.</p>
