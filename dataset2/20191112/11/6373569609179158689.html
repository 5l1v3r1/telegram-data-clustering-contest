      <h2>Richard Grant thought the victim had drugs hidden inside his body</h2>

      <p>A rapist from Plymouth has had his lengthy prison sentence extended for attacking a new inmate within hours of him arriving in jail.</p>
      <p>Richard Grant thought victim Philip Matthews had drugs hidden inside his body and - along with fellow prisoner John Edwards - launched an attack on him to try to make him hand them over.</p>
      <p>Both assailants were serving long sentences at the time of the incident in March last year. Grant had been <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/friends-who-raped-teenager-after-1378496">jailed for 11 years for a rape</a> in Plymouth and Edwards for three years and three months for a burglary in Weymouth.</p>
      <p>Mr Matthews had just arrived at Exeter Prison after being remanded in custody for committing a series of burglaries at businesses in Barnstaple, for which he was later jailed at Exeter Crown Court.</p>
      <p>He told prison officers that the two men tried to conduct an internal examination to search for the drugs by using a prison-issue plastic dessert spoon.</p>
      <p>He suffered a broken nose and eye socket during the attack but there was no medical evidence to support his allegations about the spoon.</p>
      <p>Grant, aged 31, formerly of Victoria Court, Plymouth; and Edwards, aged 46, formerly of Sussex Road, Weymouth, both admitted assault causing grievous bodily harm.</p>

      <p>Grant was jailed for 22 months and Edwards for 25 months by Judge Timothy Rose at Exeter Crown Court. Both sentences will start after their existing sentences when they finish the existing ones.</p>
      <p>The judge told them that consecutive sentences were necessary because violence within prison is a serious problem and a threat to prison discipline.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee Bremridge, prosecuting, said the offence happened on March 29 last year when the two men attacked Mr Matthews at prison.</p>
      <p>They believed he had drugs hidden inside his body and wanted him to hand them over. Checks showed that they were mistaken and Mr Matthews had no drugs on him.</p>
      <p>Mr Ali Rafati, for Grant, and Mr Richard Crabb, for Edwards, said the men denied the allegations of using a spoon in the attack. They both deserve credit for admitting what they have done.</p>
      <p>Grant was sentenced to 11 years by Judge Paul Darlow at Plymouth Crown Court only a few days before for a rape of a drunken woman who he took home from the Revolution Club and Two Trees pub in Union Street.</p>

      <p>He and another man Kieran McPartland both raped the 19-year-old at his former home in Kestor Place, North Prospect, leaving her with severe psychological damage and PTSD.</p>
      <p>McPartland, now aged 33, of Lipson Road, Greenbank, Plymouth, was jailed for 14 years, which was later reduced to 11 years on appeal.</p>
      <p>Edwards was serving a sentence at Dorchester Crown Court for a burglary at Westbourne Road, Weymouth, in which he stole a laptop, jewellery and other items.</p>
      <p>He is currently serving a 42-month sentence for false representation and fraud.</p>
