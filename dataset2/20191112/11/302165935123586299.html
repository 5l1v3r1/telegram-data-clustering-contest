      <p>BERLIN, Nov 12 — German police detained three people in the western city of Offenbach today on suspicion of planning a bomb attack on behalf of the Islamic State militant group, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The three suspects wanted to kill as many “infidels” as possible in the planned attack in the Rhine-Main region, Frankfurt prosecutor Nadja Niesen said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The main suspect is a 24-year-old German of Macedonian origin who wanted to manufacture explosives and had tried to buy a weapon online. His two accomplices are Turkish nationals aged 22 and 21.</p>
      <p>The three suspects are believed to have told people in the past that they identified themselves as IS supporters, Niesen said.</p>
      <p>Substances that could be used to make explosives and equipment were found at the main suspect’s home, she said. The authorities also secured written documents and electronic data.</p>
      <p>The main suspect is due to be brought before the investigating judge at a court in Frankfurt later today. The judge will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant and order pre-trial detention. — Reuters</p>
