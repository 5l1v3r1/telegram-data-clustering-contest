      <p>The South African Football Association confirmed that they are currently dealing with two injury scares, although it may not be too serious.</p>

      <p>However, speaking ahead of their trip, Bafana’s team doctor, Thulani Ngwenya provided an update on the latest injury worries in camp. </p>
      <p>“We have a player from Sundowns, Thapelo Morena who has a (calf) strain but we will manage that, I don’t think it is something serious that won’t make him available for selection. We also have an injury scare from Thamsanqa Mkhize who sprained his ankle in Thohoyandou, I also think it is not something very serious that won’t make him available. We are working tirelessly to get them ready,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bafana will travel back to Mzansi after Thursday’s clash, where they will thereafter gear up to face Sudan at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday, November 17. </p>
