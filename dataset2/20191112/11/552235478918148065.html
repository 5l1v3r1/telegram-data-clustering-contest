      <h1>Last-gasp Falkirk win proved Airdrie can fight for League One title says Calum Gallagher</h1>
      <h2>The Diamonds have the chance to go top of the division this Saturday as they face Stranraer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:39:41+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/airdrieonians-responded-elgin-defeat-hysteria-20865330">Airdrieonians</a> hero Calum Gallagher reckons the Diamonds proved their title credentials with a last-gasp win over Falkirk.</p>
      <p>There were dramatic scenes as the striker scored in injury-time at the Falkirk Stadium to move into third place in League One.</p>
      <p>After stunning the Bairns, who started the day top of the table, the 25-year-old says that the dressing room was “buzzing” and believed they could take the title to New Broomfield.</p>
      <p>“Over the past few weeks we have managed to get ourselves into a good place,” he told <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/airdrieonians-responded-elgin-defeat-hysteria-20865330">the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser.</a></p>
      <p>“There has been a real change in the way we are playing and the mood since early October.</p>

      <p>“We are now approaching the level of performance we feel like we should be reaching every week. The game was fairly level, we both had chances, but we held on to get the result.</p>
      <p>“It was great to get the reaction from the fans and it makes it worth it when you look at the league table.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “It was really end to end stuff.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It was frantic and hectic and that was summed up by the end of the game really.</p>
      <p>“Falkirk are a good side and probably had the best of possession, their defence was strong and we knew they would be a danger up front.</p>
      <p>“We knew we could break in numbers though and stuck to our game plan.</p>

      <p>“To go to places like Falkirk and get a win shows that we can challenge not just for the play-off places but for the league title.</p>
      <p>“It shows that we will be competitive this season but we need to keep motivated and make that push to build on a great result.”</p>
      <p>As they prepare for a tough away day in Stranraer this weekend, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ex-rangers-goalkeeper-scott-gallacher-20865329">Airdrie’s</a> top scorer is wary of a slip-up against the Blues as they look to build momentum for a promotion push.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough to toe the line between measuring your ambitions and putting too much pressure on ourselves,” he added.</p>

      <p>“We’ve got to be brave and work towards a consistent run of form, so it would be heartbreaking to beat Falkirk and then go to Stranraer and lose.</p>
      <p>“They look to be in a false position in the league and it’s a tough place to go. You know going there will be a hard game but if we want to challenge for the league it’s games we are going to have to win.”</p>
