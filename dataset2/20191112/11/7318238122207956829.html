      <p>Swedish police have announced they are setting up a special task force to combat a wave of gang violence in cities across the country.</p>
      <p>The country has seen a dramatic surge in the use of grenades and machine guns in gang-related incidents in the last twelve months, shattering its image as one of the safest countries in the world.</p>
      <p>On Sunday a fifteen boy was fatally shot in the city of Malmo and another injured.</p>
      <p>Mats Löfving, head of national police operations, said: "It is very rare that we use these special methods. There has to be an exceptional situation."</p>
      <p>Löfving added that the Malmo shooting was "the straw that broke the camel's back".</p>
      <p>"We saw a weekend in Malmö that is unacceptable, with an execution-like murder of a 15-year-old boy," he added.</p>
      <p>Police said last week that they had dealt with more than 180 bomb attacks this year alone.</p>
      <p>Therese Cedergren, a correspondent with Swedish national broadcaster TV4, said that despite Sweden's image of tranquillity, gang violence had plagued the south for many years.</p>
