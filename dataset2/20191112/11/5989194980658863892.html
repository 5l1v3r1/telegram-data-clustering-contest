      <h1>Swedish word of the day: folkkär</h1>

        <b>This Swedish word is one to help you talk about the things and people you love the most.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Folkkär</i> is a pretty word with a positive meaning. It refers to a person (usually) or a thing which is well-known and loved by people.</p>
      <p>You could translate it as 'widely loved' 'beloved by the people', or 'a popular household name', and it can easily be broken down into two parts: <i>folk</i> ('people' or 'population') and <i>kär</i> ('in love' or 'dear').</p>
      <p>It's an adjective, so you might say '<i>efter att han vann Melodifestivalen blev han riktigt folkkär</i>' (after he won Melodifestivalen he became a popular household name) or '<i>den folkkäre journalisten kommer att skriva en ny bok</i>' (the widely loved journalist will write a new book).</p>
      <p>As you might have gathered, it's different from the more neutral word <i>kändis</i> ('celebrity') which simply refers to someone who is widely known, no matter what public opinion of them might be.</p>

      <p>And the use of <i>folk</i> is interesting too. Swedish has several other words for 'popular', including <i>populär</i> or the abbreviation <i>poppis</i>, and <i>omtyckt</i>. </p>
      <p>As word nerds might already know, the words 'popular' and <i>populär</i> come from the Latin term <i>populus </i>(people) and literally mean 'liked by the general public'. Folk generally refers to 'people' in the sense of a national population, so a <i>folkkär</i> singer, athlete or author would generally be one who is considered a national treasure. They're not just popular, but they mean something to the country and its culture. So while a <i>populär</i> or <i>omtyckt</i> person might be well-liked by their immediate community, friends or colleagues, someone who is <i>folkkär</i> is known and loved across the country.</p>
      <p>In Sweden, you're more likely to hear <i>folkkär</i> used to talk about homegrown talent or figures who are particularly highly esteemed within Sweden, rather than international celebrities.</p>
      <p>And because of the personal tone of the word <i>kär</i>, it generally refers to those celebs who you feel like you know and would be down-to-earth if you ever met, rather than those who are all too aware of their fame and talent (for this reason, it's debatable whether household name and footballer <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20160525/ten-ridiculous-things-zlatan-ibrahimovic-has-compared-himself-to">Zlatan could be described as <i>folkkär</i></a>).</p>
      <p>Good examples would include Tilde de Paula Eby, a TV presenter who has fronted TV shows from news programmes to Swedish Bake-off and Let's Dance, or <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20180403/in-pictures-sweden-pays-tribute-to-its-most-beloved-star-lill-babs">the late artist Lill Babs</a> whose six-decade career included singing and acting.</p>
      <p>By default, <i>folkkär </i>tends to refer to people who are popular in Sweden specifically, but you can also say things like '<i>artisten är väldigt folkkär i Tyskland</i>' (the artist is widely beloved in Germany) or '<i>hon är en av Storbrittaniens folkkäraste författare</i>' (she is one of the UK's best loved authors).</p>
