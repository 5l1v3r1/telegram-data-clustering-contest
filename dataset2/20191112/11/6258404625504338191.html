      <p>If you just<a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/insane-amd-threadripper-radeon-optane-build"> built a high-end desktop</a> (HEDT) configuration based on a Threadripper or Core-X processor, you may want to avert your eyeballs somewhere else. At the very least, brace yourself for some numbers to follow. Your system is still fast, mind you, just not as fast as a pair of EPYC 7H12 processors in a Cray Shasta supercomputer performing a Geekbench run.<br/><br/>Before we get to the results, let's talk specs. AMD offers three <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-zen-2-cpus-design-win-dell-emc-poweredge-servers">EPYC processors</a> with 64 physical cores and 128 threads of computing muscle, the EPYC 7H12 is the fastest of the bunchâ€”it has a 2.6GHz base clock and 3.3GHz max boost clock, to go along with 256MB of L3 cache. Here's how it stacks up with a few other EPYC 7002 processors (2P)...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>EPYC 7H12: 64 cores / 128 threads, 2.6GHz to 3.3GHz, 256MB cache, 280W TDP</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>EPYC 7742</b>: 64 cores / 128 threads, 2.25GHz to 3.4GHz, 256MB cache, 225W TDP</li>
        <li><b>EPYC 7702:</b> 64 cores / 128 threads, 2GHz to 3.35GHz, 256MB cache, 200W TDP</li>
        <li><b>EPYC 7642:</b> 48 cores / 96 threads, 2.3GHz to 3.2GHz, 256MB cache, 225W TDP</li>
        <li><b>EPYC 7552:</b> 48 cores / 96 threads, 2.2GHz to 3.3GHz, 192MB cache, 200W TDP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It has the highest TDP of the bunch, a 350MHz faster base clock than the next fastest 64-core chip, and a 100MHz slower boost clock. The all-core boost clock might be higher, though, to help account for a TDP that is 55W higher than the EPYC 7742.<br/><br/>Specs out of the way, let's get to the Geekbench run.</p>
      <h3>Cray Shasta Supercomputer With Two EPYC 7H12 CPUs Get Benched In Geekbench</h3>

      <p>The Cray Shasta system is rocking two EPYC 7H12 processors, giving it 128 cores and 256 threads to throw at the benchmark. In the single-core test, it scored 4,512. Impressive, but not roof shattering by any stretch. It scored a much higher 181,580 in the multi-core test, though, which hammered all those cores and threads.<br/><br/>Impressive, though surprisingly enough, it is not record setting. In fact, multi-core score posted by the Cray Shasta supercomputer ranks No. 10 in Geekbench. Several configs that posted higher scores are actually based on the EPYC 7742, including the top performer. Here's a look...</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/gigabyte">Gigabyte</a> R282-Z92 config with a pair of EPYC 7742 sits on top of the multi-core benchmark results, with a score of 195,309. It also posted a faster single-core score of 4,666.<br/><br/>Running different operating systems can account the discrepancies in scores, as can the memory configuration and other details. Either way, these are crazy-fast scores that underscore the potential power of AMD's latest generation EPYC server processors.</p>
