We talked to her about it back when she shared its lead single &quot;Gleaming,&quot; and now she's putting out another track from it, &quot;Bleachers.&quot; It's a languid swirl of scratchy guitars and soft harmonies, Yacina's refrain of &quot;What are you doing to me?&quot; reeling at the unexpected consequences of an absence. It solidifies around a moment of personal revelation: &quot;It's a shame when I convince myself I'm not real/ On the train, I'm running out of ideals,&quot; and the song then floats off into a dream state. &quot;This song is about how people can stay in your life for a long time, and how losing them can feel like losing a part of your own identity,&quot; Yacina said in a statement. Listen to it via GoldFlakePaint below. Remember The Silver is out 12/6. Pre-order it here. The album release show will be 12/7 in Brooklyn, NY at Union Pool."/>

      <p>Emily Yacina is releasing a new album, <i>Remember The Silver</i>, next month. We <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2060766/emily-yacina-remember-the-silver-interview/franchises/interview/">talked to her about it</a> back when she shared its lead single “Gleaming,” and now she’s putting out another track from it, “Bleachers.” It’s a languid swirl of scratchy guitars and soft harmonies, Yacina’s refrain of “What are you doing to me?” reeling at the unexpected consequences of an absence.</p>
      <p>It solidifies around a moment of personal revelation: “It’s a shame when I convince myself I’m not real/ On the train, I’m running out of ideals,” and the song then floats off into a dream state. “This song is about how people can stay in your life for a long time, and how losing them can feel like losing a part of your own identity,” Yacina said in a statement.
