      <h2>Schools in Perth and Kinross to benefit from mental health initiative launched by Sir Chris Hoy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:37:35+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Chalmers</a></address>
      <p>Over 90 schools in Perth and Kinross are to benefit from a new mental health initiative launched by Sir Chris Hoy.</p>
      <p>Ninety-five schools in the region will soon have access to active school coordinators that will be trained to exercise and manage mental health, as well as physical health, as part of a new partnership between the Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and sportscotland.</p>
      <p>Launched by SAMH’s long-standing ambassador, multiple Olympic gold winner Sir Chris Hoy, the new initiative will offer mental health training to 400 active schools coordinators across Scotland.</p>
      <p>The partnership with sportscotland aims to help the next generation of young people protect their mental health through physical activity and sport.</p>
      <p>The 400-strong group of active schools coordinators will benefit from a mental health training programme that teaches practical ways of monitoring and managing mental health through their work in schools across the country.</p>
      <p>Perth and Kinross-based active schools manager, Tammy McKinlay, said: “Further education, across the board, on mental health awareness is really important, especially where young people are concerned.</p>
      <p>“We are engaging with young people every day and have the opportunity to identify signs that an individual is struggling with their mental health in the early stages.</p>
      <p>“In doing so, we can make a difference through early intervention and make a real, positive, difference if we think something is wrong.</p>
      <p>“With this training provided by SAMH, we will be better equipped to handle these situations with confidence and hopefully make a difference to the lives of the young people of Scotland.”</p>
      <p>SAMH launched its first sport and physical activity campaign in 2009 alongside Sir Chris Hoy. Together, the Olympian and SAMH have spent the last decade tackling the barriers that prevent people with mental health problems from improving their physical fitness.</p>
      <p>Sir Chris said: “I’m proud to mark 10 years as a SAMH ambassador by launching a new partnership that will help the next generation of young people have better mental health through physical activity.</p>
      <p>“I’ve experienced some of the biggest highs in sporting history but there have been low points too. During those low moments it was cycling that gave me the strength to keep going.</p>
      <p>“I’m a real believer in the link between physical activity and good mental health as I know how my mood and wellbeing can be affected if I don’t manage to get out on my bike regularly.”</p>
      <p>The new partnership will see SAMH and sportscotland working together to deliver the aims of the charter, as well as creating a learning and development programme for sportscotland staff, developing in-depth mental health and wellbeing programmes.</p>
