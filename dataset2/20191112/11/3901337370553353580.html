      <p>Balotelli recently made headlines when he hit out at the racial abuse he suffered during Brescia's Serie A match against Hellas Verona.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Italian Football Federation president Gabriele Gravina suggested that calling Balotelli up to the next national team camp would send a strong message to the racist elements within the country, but the former Inter Milan, AC Milan and Manchester City star was overlooked for selection.</p>
      <p>Azzurri boss Mancini has now explained his decision to snub the 29-year-old, whom he had previously worked with at both Inter and City.</p>

      <p>"When I call Mario Balotelli, it will be because he deserves it, not because of the colour of his skin," Mancini said, as reported by <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>"I know Mario and I love him. Remember, I got Mario to play when he was a boy, so I know him really well.</p>
      <p>"You can think like the president said, but you need to understand that if Balotelli gets another chance, it will be because he deserves it from a technical point of view."</p>
