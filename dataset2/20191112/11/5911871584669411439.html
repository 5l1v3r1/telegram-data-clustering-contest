It's the first Ratboys album conceived of and played with a full-time band outside of the project's principal members Julia Steiner and Dave Sagan, and you can hear that tight-knit energy on lead single &quot;Alien With A Sleep Mask On.&quot; It builds on the imagery of its title throughout, a twangy rock rush about feeling unreal in reality. &quot;I'm an alien with a sleep mask on,&quot; Steiner reiterates in the chorus. &quot;And I don't know where I went wrong/ And I'm sleeping with both eyes closed. The track's music video was directed by coool — the directing duo of John TerEick + Jake Nokovic — and it finds Steiner stuck in to outer space as a team of scientists try to get her out safely.
