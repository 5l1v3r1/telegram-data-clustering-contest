      <p>As 2019 comes to a close, we’ll begin to see year-end lists pop up around the internet. Google is no stranger to these lists as they typically give out Google Play Store <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/2018-google-play-awards-nominees/">awards</a>. Today, Google announced that it has opened up voting for the 2019 Google Play Users’ Choice Awards.</p>
      <p>The User’s Choice Awards are, unsurprisingly, decided purely by user votes. There are four categories to vote in: apps, games, movies, and books. Each category has a number of nominees to choose from, including <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightricks.pixaloop">Enlight Pixaloop</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaka">Mario Kart Tour</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies/details/Marvel_Studios_Avengers_Endgame?id=ePpJDKfRAyM">Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Endgame</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/E_L_James_The_Mister?id=tHaEDwAAQBAJ">The Mister</a>.
