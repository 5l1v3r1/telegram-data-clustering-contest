      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tesco-0">Tesco</a> has taken down an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/advert">advert</a> featuring <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mel_B">Mel B</a> after the Spice Girl called the supermarket out on social media.</p>
      <p>The photograph of the singer, which shows her wearing a leopard print jumpsuit during the 1997 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Spice_Girls">Spice Girls</a> performance at the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BRITAwards">Brit Awards</a>, was used to promote Tesco’s new Clubcard Plus.</p>
      <p>The image features two speech bubbles, which read: “Stop right now. You get 10 per cent off two big shops a month for £7.99. Thank you very much,” a twist on the lyrics of the hit Spice Girls song “Stop”.</p>
      <p>Mel B shared a picture of the advert on Instagram, expressing her anger over the use of her image for the campaign.</p>
      <p>“Can the CEO of @tescofood DAVE LEWIS PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY. Thank you,” she wrote in the caption.</p>

      <p>Tesco said it has now removed the image from the Tesco Clubcard Plus campaign, which pays homage to cultural references from the past century in celebration of the firm’s 100th anniversary.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the company said they were “excited” for Mel B to be included in the advert.</p>
      <p>“Here at Tesco we are really big fans of Mel B and were excited to feature her photo in our campaign,” they stated.</p>
      <p>“We had authorisation to use this image, but we’re sorry Mel B is unhappy so we’ve stopped using it.”</p>
      <p>After Mel B shared the photo of the advert on Instagram, several people commented on the Spice Girl’s boldness to publicly call out Tesco online.</p>
      <p>“Someone f***ed right up!” wrote fellow singer <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jess-glynne">Jess Glynne</a>. </p>
      <p>“Guess what they want, really really want is a lawsuit,” remarked model <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/charli-howard-plus-size-model-lingerie-agent-provocateur-campaign-valentines-day-a8747916.html">Charli Howard</a>.</p>
