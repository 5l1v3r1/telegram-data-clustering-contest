      <p>A group of thieves have been jailed for stealing more than £12,000 of cable from a railway line during a series of "incredibly dangerous" heists.</p>
      <p>Twin brothers Christopher and Michael Nugent and a third man, Martin Ward, were all caged for their part in the reckless stunts in Charfield, South Glos., in August 2017.</p>
      <p>The trio were caught after a train worker noticed damage and a loss of cable on the tracks and installed a motion censor camera to monitor the area.</p>
      <p>The device then sent out an alert three days later and officers rushed to the scene - catching the brothers in the act.</p>

      <p>A vehicle registered to Ward was also found near the railway line and all three were arrested on suspicion of theft.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mobile phone records then placed the trio at the location at the estimated time of the incidents.</p>
      <p>All three pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court last week (Fri) and have now been jailed.</p>

      <p>Mike Gallop, route director of Network Rail Western said: "We welcome the decision to jail the three males who stole thousands of pounds worth of cable from the railway in Bristol.</p>
      <p>"Cable theft results in significant delays and cancellations across the network and these penalties show just how seriously the rail industry and the British Transport Police take this crime.</p>
      <p>"Any attempt to steal cable from the railway is not only a criminal offence but is also incredibly dangerous.</p>
      <p>"Anyone trespassing on the railway risks serious injury – or worse."</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Dan Murdoch, of British Transport Police, added: "This was a determined theft which cost the railway an estimated £12,700 in loss, delays and damages and also had the potential to endanger the lives of workers and passengers."</p>
