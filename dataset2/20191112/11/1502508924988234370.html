      <p>The Pune project is proposed at 10 hectares of land.</p>
      <p>According to the agenda paper, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tata-consultancy-services">Tata Consultancy Services </a>Ltd has sought formal approval from the government to set up IT/ITeS zone in Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tcs">TCS </a>Ltd has proposed to invest Rs 900 crore in this zone and provide employment to about 12,000 persons," it said.</p>
      <p>The company has requested to allow for setting up of unit with an initial development centre and start the business operations before the deadline of March 31, 2020. All these three proposals are placed before the board for their consideration, it added.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sezs">SEZs </a>are demanding support, including removal of minimum alternate tax, from the government with a view to boost outbound shipments from these zones. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sezs">SEZs </a>are major export hubs in the country as the government provides several incentives and single-window clearance system.
