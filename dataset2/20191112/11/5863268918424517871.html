      <p>KARACHI (Dunya News) – The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued commemorative coin worth Rs550 to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak.</p>
      <p>One side of the coin has the image of Janam Asthan Nankana Sahib, while the other side of the coin is engraved with the words of ‘Islamic Republic of Pakistan’.</p>
      <p>In this regard, SBP Governor Reza Baqir said the purpose of releasing the commemorative coin by the central bank was to supplement and be part of national efforts to promote interfaith harmony.</p>
      <p>He said the founder of Sikh religion preached the message of peace and brotherhood. He expressed the confidence that through this coin his message will reach every household.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the government also issued commemorative postage stamps to mark the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak. With the image of Gurdwara Janam Asthan and worth Rs8, the stamps can be used commonly.</p>
      <p>Under the approval from Prime Minister Imran Khan, Minister for Postal Services Murad Saeed had directed the Pakistan Post to issue stamps.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan Post will establish a post office at Kartarpur complex to facilitate Sikh pilgrims. Another post office will also be opened in Nankana Sahib.</p>
      <p>Moreover, these stamps will be provided in 192 member countries of Universal Postal Union.</p>
      <p>Since then, the city of Nankana Sahib has been transformed as thousands of Sikhs and other devotees of Guru Nanak have descended upon it to celebrate his birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>They have come from across Pakistan, the Middle East, Europe, the United States and Canada, but the majority has arrived from neighbouring India.</p>
      <p>The Sikh community on Tuesday is observing 550th birth anniversary of spiritual leader Baba Guru Nanak – the founder of Sikhism who died in the 16th Century. Meanwhile, foolproof security arrangements have been made to avoid any untoward incident.</p>
      <p>The main ceremony to pay respect to Baba Guru Nanak will be held at Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, several federal ministers will join Sikh devotees and followers from all over the world in the ceremony.</p>
      <p>As part of the celebration, Prime Minister Imran Khan formally inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor on Nov. 9, thereby allowing Indian pilgrims to travel across the border without visas between the Indian town of Dera Baba Nanak and the Sri Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara, Guru Nanak’s final resting place, about 6km (4 miles) away in Pakistan.</p>
