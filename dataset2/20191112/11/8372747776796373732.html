      <p>ATLANTA â€“ <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/jimmy-carter-health-hospital-procedure/index.html">Former President Jimmy Carter</a> is recovering at a hospital in Atlanta after undergoing an operation Tuesday morning to relieve pressure on his brain, according to the Carter Center.</p>
      <p>"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is recovering at Emory University Hospital following surgery this morning to relieve pressure on his brain from a subdural hematoma. There are no complications from the surgery," the center <a href="https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1194270636857790464/photo/1">said in a statement</a> .</p>
      <p>Carter will remain in the hospital as long as advisable for observation, according to the center.</p>
      <p>"We do not anticipate any further statements until he is released from the hospital. President and Mrs. Carter thank everyone for the many well-wishes they have received," the center said.</p>
      <p>The former president was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/jimmy-carter-health-hospital-procedure/index.html">admitted to Emory University Hospital</a> on Monday night ahead of his procedure to relieve the pressure caused by bleeding from his recent falls, the center had said.</p>
      <p>Carter, 95, had been hospitalized twice last month for two falls in his house in Plains, Georgia. He required 14 stitches above his brow after his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/08/us/carter-building-houses-after-stitches-falling-trnd/index.html">first fall</a> while getting ready for church. But it didn't deter him from traveling <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/06/us/jimmy-carter-falls-stitches/index.html">to Nashville that same day</a> for a week of building houses with Habitat for Humanity. He was admitted to the hospital and treated for a minor pelvic fracture after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/jimmy-carter-hospital-fall-home/index.html">his second fall.</a></p>
      <p>Carter will not attend Sunday service this weekend at the Maranatha Baptist Church, where he has taught Sunday school for years, according to a voicemail recording on the church's phone line.</p>
