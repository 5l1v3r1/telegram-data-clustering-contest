      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> wide receiver Tyler Lockett was hospitalized Monday night after suffering a “severe” lower leg contusion during a game against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>.</p>
      <p>Lockett suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of the Seahawks’ overtime win over the 49ers. He did not play in overtime and was last seen fielding a kickoff to send the game into the extra frame. He was taken to a Santa Clara hospital for an evaluation.</p>

      <p>“He’s out of here right now to get looked at,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said after the game, according to<a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/12/tyler-lockett-taken-to-hospital-following-severe-contusion-to-leg/"> Pro Football Talk</a>. “It will be OK, but it’s a pretty severe situation for right now.”</p>
      <p>Carroll added: “I think there was a lot of swelling. The contusion caused a lot of swelling right away and they’ve got stuff… there [are] concerns about that so they’ve got to make sure… There’s a compartment element in this so they’ve got to make sure and just got to take care of him. And we’re ahead of it so we should be in good shape.”</p>

      <p>Lockett has been one of the best receivers in the league this season and has helped quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> stake a claim for the NFL MVP award.</p>
      <p>Lockett caught three passes for 26 yards in the game.</p>
