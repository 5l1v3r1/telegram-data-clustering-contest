      <h1>Fiat Chrysler patent shows a turbocharged inline-six engine</h1>
      <h2>The 3.0-liter Global Medium Engine codenamed 'Tornado' looks real</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:09:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/jonathon-ramsey" target="_blank">Jonathon Ramsey</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/rumormill/">rumor</a> that <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/09/21/fiat-chrysler-inline-six-rumor/">Fiat Chrysler is developing an inline six-cylinder</a> surfaced on <i>Allpar</i> more than a year ago. <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2018/12/20/fca-inline-six-rumored-jeep-wagoneer/">In a follow-up report</a> in December last year, <i>Allpar</i> tapped its sources to add more information, like the codename "Tornado" and the plan for the turbocharged motor to replace the 5.7-liter Hemi V8. Even so, it only made sense to speak of the engine as a rumor at the time. Now we have our first bit of circumstantial evidence, <a href="https://moparinsiders.com/fca-files-patent-related-to-upcoming-turbo-inline-6/"><i>Mopar Insiders</i> having found</a> a patent issued to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/fca/">FCA</a> that uses drawings of an inline-six to describe a system for tracking elements in exhaust gases in a turbocharged inline-six. FCA applied for the patent on November 1, 2017, the <a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=10247142&amp;IDKey=E83D8890D470&amp;HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.htm%2526r%3D201%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPTXT%2526s1%3Dfca%2526p%3D5%2526OS%3Dfca%2526RS%3Dfca">U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted it</a> April 2, 2019.</p>
      <p>As with everything else in a patent application, the drawing cannot be an accident. The U.S. PTO granted two other engine-related patents to FCA on March 19 and April 2 this year, and FCA used drawings of a V6 in both of those applications.</p>
      <p>The December <i>Allpar</i> report presumed one version of the Tornado engine would get a single, twin-scroll turbo and slot into service with <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/chrysler/">Chrysler</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/">Dodge</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/">Jeep</a>, and Ram. Another version with twin turbos, and perhaps revised heads, could do time with <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/alfa+romeo/">Alfa Romeo</a>, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/maserati/">Maserati</a>, and perhaps SRT. <i>Mopar Insiders</i> doesn't break down turbo count, but cites its sources as revealing an output range of 360 horsepower up to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/bmw/525/">525</a> horsepower. <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/article/20180601/ANE/180609969/fiat-chrysler-bets-on-electrification-for-alfa-jeep-and-maserati">FCA's E-Booster technology</a>, originally mentioned as a way to help a revived Alfa Romeo 8C get 700 hp, will enable larger turbos on performance versions of the Tornado I-6. E-Booster electrifies some aspect of the turbocharger — FCA hasn't got into the details yet — to eliminate lag while providing 25 percent more power. <i>Mopar Insiders'</i> output figures would give the engine long enough legs to replace the 3.2-liter and 3.6-liter Pentastar V6s, as well as the 5.7-liter Hemi V8. The site said the Tornado will also replace the canceled 7.0-liter Banshee V8.</p>
      <p>The 3.0-liter Tornado Global Medium <a href="http://amzn.to/20zAez5">Engine</a> Turbocharged 6 (GME T-6), based on the Hurricane 2.0-liter GME four-cylinder (GME I-4), is expected to go into FCA products around the world. We'll wait to see how the PSA merger might affect allocation. Displacement will come in a hair below three liters so as to avoid tax thresholds in certain countries, and it was said engineers were trying to keep the inline-six no more than three inches longer than the 2.4-liter Tigershark four-cylinder. The initial application could be in the next-generation <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/grand+cherokee/">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a>, or in the Jeep Wagoneer, although it could be late availability on both since the straight-six isn't predicted to arrive for a few years. </p>
