      <h3>Adelaide household water bills are reportedly set to go down by an average of $26 a year.</h3>
      <p>According to The Advertiser:</p>
      <blockquote>The plan, now open for public comment, aims to cut water prices by 1.8 per cent and sewerage by 3.2 per cent — delivering a $26 cut to this financial year’s average annual bill of $1258 for a city household.<br/><br/>“Through our ongoing focus on smart technologies, maximising productivity of our assets, and containing the costs of an expanded capital program, we’re now leading the efficiency frontier in Australia and have made the biggest efficiency gains of our peer water utilities,” SA Water manager of customer delivery Kerry Rowlands said.<br/><br/>“We’re now in a position to deliver a real price decrease, while still covering all of the fundamentals that protect public health and the environment, as well as pursuing initiatives that will deliver sustainable experience improvements for our customers.”</blockquote>
