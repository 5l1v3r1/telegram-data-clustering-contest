      <p>Revealed on Monday, Walmart Voice Order integration <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2019/11/11/hey-siri-add-to-walmart-introducing-a-new-shortcut-for-online-grocery">is accomplished</a> through a Siri Shortcut that interfaces with the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walmart-grocery-shopping/id998754894">Walmart Grocery Shopping</a> app for iOS. Introduced earlier this year, Voice Order provides customers the ability to add items to their Grocery Cart with minimal interaction.<br/><br/>After pairing accounts and allowing Siri access to Walmart's app, users can simply invoke Siri and say, "Add to Walmart," or a similar trigger phrase to begin shopping. Tight integration with a customer's purchase history makes for a highly personalized experience, with the app capable of distinguishing commonly purchased brands. <br/><br/>For example, asking Siri to add "orange juice" might add the specific item "Great Value organic orange juice with no pulp," depending on purchase history. The more the app and Siri Shortcut are used, the better the system becomes at recognizing what products to add to cart.<br/><br/>When a shopping list is complete, users can submit their order to the nearest Walmart, where staff will begin gathering items for pickup or delivery. <br/><br/>As a Siri Shortcut, the Walmart shopping capability is synced across iOS devices, allowing customers to access the feature from nearly anywhere. <br/><br/>To set up Voice Order and add Siri support, customers must navigate to "Voice Shopping" on the Walmart Grocery App account page and follow onscreen instructions.</p>
