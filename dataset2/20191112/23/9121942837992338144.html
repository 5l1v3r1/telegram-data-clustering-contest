      <p>The United States dropped to 1-3 in the super round of an Olympic baseball qualifying tournament, losing to Australia 2-1 on Wednesday at the Tokyo Dome.</p>
      <p>Minnesota prospect Aaron Whitefield hit a two-run single in the first off Boston’s Tanner Houck at the Premier12 tournament game.</p>
      <p>The U.S. was held to four hits, including an eighth-inning home run by Oakland’s Mark Payton off Ryan Searle.</p>
      <p>Winner Tim Atherton allowed one hit in 5 1/3 innings, and former big leaguer Peter Moylan got two outs. Jon Kennedy retired two batters for the save, including the New York Yankees’ Erik Kratz on a game-ending flyout.</p>
      <p>Mexico was 3-0 heading into its game against Japan later Wednesday,</p>
      <p>Managed by Scott Brosius, the U.S. plays Taiwan on Friday. The top finisher from the Americas qualifies for the Tokyo Olympics next year. The second-place finisher from the Americas goes to a final qualifying tournament in March or April.</p>
