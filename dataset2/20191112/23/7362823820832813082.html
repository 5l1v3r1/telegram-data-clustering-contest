      <h1>Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor-turned-climate activist, reportedly drives 'tank' to run errands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:29:32+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:29</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/arnold-schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> has been outspoken about climate-change activism in recent years -- but the actor and ex-governor reportedly can be seen driving a "tank" while running errands.</p>
      <p>The "Terminator" was seen driving a military-style vehicle to Brentwood Country Mart in Santa Monica, Calif., and the 72-year-old was "having a bit of trouble getting back into his Pinzgauer all-terrain vehicle," Page Six <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/12/arnold-schwarzenegger-runs-errands-in-tank-like-suv/">reported</a> Tuesday.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the price of Pinzgauers could range from $18,000 to a whopping $70,000.</p>
      <p>His recent outing came days after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/arnold-schwarzenegger-bikes-greta-thunberg">his widely publicized bike ride</a> with 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg.</p>

      <p>"It was fantastic to see my friend and one of my heroes <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg">@GretaThunberg</a> last week and go on a bike ride around Santa Monica together and I was so pumped to introduce her to my daughter Christina. Keep inspiring, Greta!" Schwarzenegger <a href="https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1191493616213975040">tweeted.</a></p>

      <p>In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded R20 Regions of Climate Action, an environmental organization made of a coalition between nations, companies, and institutions with the mission to advance a greener economy in order to combat climate change.</p>
      <p>The former California governor also has been outspoken with his criticism against President Trump, slamming the commander-in-chief for being "wrong" on his views of climate change.</p>
