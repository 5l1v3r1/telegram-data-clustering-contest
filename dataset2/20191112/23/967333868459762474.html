      <p>In March, the state of Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that Remington could be sued by victimsâ€™ families for how the company marketed the assault-style weapon a gunman used to kill 20 Sandy Hook schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>Remington, joined by a number of gun rights activists, had argued that federal law protects weapons manufacturers from being sued over gun crimes.</p>
      <p>A lone gunman armed with a Remington assault rifle <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201812141070700124-sandy-hook-school-evacuation/">opened fire on children at Sandy Hook school</a> in Connecticut in December 2012, killing 20 children and six staff before killing himself.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit comes amid a spate of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911011077199158-four-people-reportedly-killed-10-wounded-at-halloween-party-shooting-in-california---video/">mass shootings in the United States</a>, many using military-style assault rifles, such as the 2017 massacre at a concert in the city of Las Vegas that killed 58 and wounded hundreds.</p>
