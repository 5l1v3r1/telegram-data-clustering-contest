      <p>Although <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477354/black-widow-what-we-know-so-far"><i>Black Widow</i></a>, the first installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase 4, wrapped up filming early last month, official footage from the movie still hasn’t been released to the public. As such, we don’t have any good looks at <i>Black Widow</i>’s new characters, including David Harbour’s Red Guardian, but one artist has put together a solid mock-up of what <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481045/david-harbour-has-wrapped-on-black-widow-see-how-he-celebrated">the <i>Stranger Things</i> star</a> could look like as the Russian super soldier.</p>

      <p>Okay, technically speaking, we’ve gotten one look at David Harbour as Red Guardian thanks to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478636/black-widow-poster-shows-david-harbour-as-red-guardian">a <i>Black Widow</i> poster that was on display at D23</a>, but that was a profile shot where he was presented alongside a bunch of other characters. We saw the side of his mask and the star emblazoned on his chest, but that’s it.</p>
      <p>This artwork, made by Instagram user <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britedit/">britedit</a>, provides a much better idea of what David Harbour will look like in the Red Guardian costume, although to be clear, this is not official in any way. Still, working off the tiny portion of the Red Guardian suit we have seen, plus taking into account the character’s ties to Captain America, it’s a logical guess on how he could look in action during <i>Black Widow</i>.</p>
      <p>All we know about David Harbour’s Red Guardian is that his real name is Alexei Shostakov (this was the second individual to hold the Red Guardian mantle <a href="http://comixology.sjv.io/53rAN">in the comics</a>), he’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480354/black-widows-david-harbour-explains-red-guardians-origin">the Russian counterpart to Captain America</a> (we have yet to learn how he received his special abilities) and he has history with Natasha Romanoff. Whether they’ll be allies for the whole movie or if Red Guardian will be revealed to have sinister intentions remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>With six months to go until <i>Black Widow</i>’s release, we still don’t know any official plot details other than it will follow Natasha Romanoff alone and forced to confront her past between the events of <i>Captain America: Civil War</i> and <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. And she won’t be the movie’s only Black Widow, as Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova and Rachel Weisz’s Melina also go by that moniker.</p>
      <p>Joining all of the previously mentioned actors are O-T Fagbenle, Ray Winstone, Olivier Ritchers and a yet-to-be-identified actor who’s playing Taskmaster. We’ll also see William Hurt and Robert Downey Jr. reprise <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481400/looks-like-black-widow-will-feature-another-familiar-mcu-face">Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross</a> and Tony Stark, respectively, although Downey’s appearance will be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480296/wait-robert-downey-jr-could-be-in-black-widow">through unused footage from <i>Captain America: Civil War</i></a>.</p>
      <p><i>Black Widow</i> opens in theaters on May 1, so keep checking back with CinemaBlend for continuing coverage, including when the first trailer finally drops. In the meantime, you can learn what other MCU movies are slated for Phase 4 and beyond with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/upcoming-marvel-movies-release-dates-for-phase-4-and-5-67944.html">our comprehensive guide</a>.</p>
      <p>As for David Harbour, he’s also set to appear in <i>Dhaka</i>, which doesn’t have a release date yet. The fate of his <i>Stranger Things</i> character, Jim Hopper, still hasn’t been revealed yet, so we can’t say for sure just yet if he’ll appear <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484097/stranger-things-revealed-a-hellfire-start-to-season-4">in Season 4</a>.</p>
