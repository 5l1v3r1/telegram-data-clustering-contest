      <p><a href="http://www.nhl.com/senators">Ottawa Senators</a> goaltender <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/anders-nilsson-auston-matthews-cale-makar-named-nhl-3-stars/c-311165108">Anders Nilsson of Lulea, Sweden was named the National Hockey League first star of the week</a> for the week from November 4-10, 2019 on Monday. Nilsson played three games and won all three games and only gave up five goals.</p>
      <p>Nilsson received the weekly honor even though he did not record a shutout. He had a goals against average of 1.64 and a save percentage of .950.</p>
      <p>Nilsson’s first win was a 6-2 win over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden in New York on November 4. He made 32 saves on 34 shots.</p>
      <p>Nilsson then beat the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa, Ontario on November 7. In this contest, Nilsson made 26 saves on 28 shots as Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored at 3:12 of overtime to break a 2-2 deadlock.</p>
      <p>Then on November 9, Nilsson had his most impressive performance of the year. He made 38 saves on 39 shots in a 4-1 Senators win over the Carolina Hurricanes at the Canadian Tire Centre.</p>
      <p>On the season, Nilsson has a record of four wins, four regulation losses and one loss in extra time. In nine games, he has a goals against average of 2.98 and a save percentage of .921.</p>
      <p>It appears that Nilsson will be the starting goaltender for the Senators for the foreseeable future even though he was in net on Monday night during an 8-2 Hurricanes win over Ottawa in the second game of a back-to-back. Nilsson and Craig Anderson of Park Ridge, IL both saw action and struggled as they gave up four goals each.</p>
      <p>It has been a very difficult season for Anderson so far. In 10 games, he has a record of two wins, six losses, a goals against average of 3.49 and a save percentage of .891.</p>
      <p>The Senators are currently in seventh place in the Atlantic Division. They have a record of six wins, 10 regulation losses and one loss in extra time for 13 points.</p>
