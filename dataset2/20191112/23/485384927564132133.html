      <h1>Can you still enjoy a U2 show when you don't like the songs?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:01:34+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Condon, https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/dan-condon/10026738</a></address>
      <p>U2's The Joshua Tree tour is a feat of grand ambition — but can it silence the haters?</p>
      <p>I've never liked <b>U2</b>. Not sure why. God knows I've tried.</p>
      <p>The whole album on the iPhone thing didn't bother me. It's the tepid songs that raise my ire. Their melodies are yawn-inducing and their desperate need to be dramatic and atmospheric at every stop doesn't stop them coming across as beige and milquetoast.</p>
      <p>I'm not smug about this. I'm jealous of U2 fans. Their favourite band pull no punches in any aspect of their work. For all their blandness, the songs are grandiose in scope. Their outspoken dedication to charity and social justice is admirable.</p>
      <p>And U2 are truly at the top of their game when it comes to their legendary live show.</p>
      <p>These shows are feats of grand ambition. On almost every tour, the band seeks to break records, to provide their fans with experiences no other artist has managed before.</p>
      <p>They ensure their show is on the cutting edge of technology. They throw untold amounts of money at making stadium shows the spectaculars they deserve to be.</p>
      <p>But, on the first night of the Australian leg of <i>The Joshua Tree</i> Tour at Brisbane's Lang Park, U2's most impressive trait was their relative restraint.</p>
      <h3>The best parts of U2</h3>
      <p>Given my lifetime of ambivalence towards this band, it’s astounding how quickly they endear themselves when the show begins.</p>
      <p>For the first part of their set, the four members of U2 are set up on a secondary stage set right in the middle of the gargantuan football field. It's a tough challenge to make a stadium feel intimate, but this is a pretty effective way to go about it.</p>
      <p>I don’t know if it’s the volume, the excitement of the crowd, or the general sense of occasion, but 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' is a ferociously powerful opener. 'New Year's Day', which comes next, is just as strong.</p>
      <p>Despite their reputation for bloat, this early part of the set shows U2 as a simple, almost humble rock band. It shows the musicality of the members and the chemistry between them; the substance behind the style.</p>
      <p>These shows are a celebration of the band's enormous 1987 album <i>The Joshua Tree</i>, so the guts of the set is taken up by a full playthrough of the album.</p>
      <p>For this part of the show, the band unveil the centrepiece of the tour; an enormous 200-foot-long screen, displaying stunning visuals from collaborator Anton Corbijn in razor-sharp 8k high definition.</p>

      <p>It's a bloody big screen, but the novelty of a big, shiny toy will always wear off. It's the way in which it's used that makes it such an effective prop.</p>
      <p>For the album's duration, the visuals are bold, stark and artful, as the band resist the urge to use it for their most ostentatious whims. The shots of the Californian desert are stunning and help give a kind of atmospheric context to a non-fan.</p>
      <p>The album opens with an almighty triumvirate of songs – 'Where the Streets Have No Name', 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', 'With or Without You' – pieces so iconic that their titles paint a vivid picture all on their own.</p>
      <p>In terms of performances, you need to nit-pick to find flaws. Bono's voice doesn't always soar as high as it should, but this fallibility isn't a concern. If anything, it humanises the band.</p>
      <p>The Edge's guitar work is scintillating throughout; songs like 'Bullet The Blue Sky' are driven home by his razor sharp tone.</p>
      <p>It's the all-round subtlety of the show that’s most impressive. The band harness the power of simplicity to deliver a stadium show that feels as if it has some emotion.</p>
      <p>Simple acts like silently walking in a single line between their main stage and the smaller stage are powerful. The lack of fireworks and even many flashing lights is a clever approach.</p>
      <p>They might be the biggest band in the world, but they prove that they don't always have to act like it.</p>
      <h3>The worst parts of U2</h3>
      <p>With the surprisingly tasteful <i>Joshua Tree</i> component on the show over, the band emerge for a crowd-pleasing encore. The goodwill quickly diminishes.</p>
      <p>The visuals become tacky – borderline hideous in comparison to Corbijn's classy vision – as U2 smash out a grab-bag of their biggest hits.</p>
      <p>The band's bloated bombast kicks in as they launch into 'Elevation', the considered class and subtlety of before blown away by flashing lights and Robbie Williams-style showmanship.</p>
      <p>I sit in my seat wishing I could be as moved by a song as banal as 'Beautiful Day' as most of the crowd appears to be, before the huge screen highlights the achievements of ground-breaking women during 'Ultraviolet (Light My Way)'.</p>
      <p>This is a clever move, as it both educates the audience about these women's work, and distracts us from how incredibly bland that song is. It's nice to see some Australian women – Magda Szubanski, Cathy Freeman, Nova Peris, Hannah Gadsby – get some recognition too.</p>
      <p>Speaking of local references, their version of 'Bad', early in the set, is bland at best and offensive at worst. Bono attempts to shoehorn Midnight Oil's 'Beds Are Burning' into the backend of the song, but it sounds like an afterthought – and not an especially good one.</p>
      <p>The polarising frontman's preachy style of stage banter grates as well. But there's not enough of it to detract from the success of the show. He doesn't give the haters enough ammo to work with.</p>
      <h3>Finding the value in U2</h3>
      <p>This show proves that, when at their best, U2 are a band of great substance and raw talent.</p>
      <p>Compared to a band like Fleetwood Mac – sure, they're older, but they charge the same ticket price – U2 come across as a dominant force. They're still completely on top of their game, musically almost flawless, and with plenty of fire still burning inside them.</p>
      <p>If you separate the band from their reputation and take this show at face-value – imagining they were any other professional band in operation today – this show is extraordinary.</p>
      <p>When their focus is on art, they shine. They shine bright enough that you forget the politics, the ostentatiousness, the fact that Bono somehow forces himself into every rock documentary ever made.</p>
      <p>Maybe it was my low personal expectations, maybe it’s the result of a lifetime of forced exposure to their music, maybe it’s Stockholm Syndrome from being stuck in a football stadium with 52,000 U2 fans. But, I’m willing to say it: I went and saw U2 and didn’t have a terrible time.</p>
      <p>All my life I’ve known that U2 are an easy band to hate. It’s only now that I’m starting to understand how it’s possible to love them.</p>
