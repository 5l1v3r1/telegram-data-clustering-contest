      <h2>Rebekah Vardy has posted a cryptic message to those she believes have crossed her as the 'Wagatha Christie' feud with Coleen Rooney rumbles on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:51:25+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:51</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Rebekah Vardy has taken aim at those she believes have wronged her.</p>
      <p>In a post on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> story, the 37-year-old said her enemies will "destroy themselves" as her feud with Coleen Rooney refuses to die down.</p>
      <p>The WAG shared with her followers a message which most commenters believe was a dig at Wayne Rooney's wife.</p>
      <p>Rebekah wrote: "Allow your enemies their space to hate; they will destroy themselves in the process."</p>
      <p>The rift between Rebekah and Coleen has not been healed since Rooney turned sleuth and accused her former friend of spreading stories about her, in a scandal that was dubbed 'Wagatha Christie'.</p>

      <p>It has been reported that Coleen had been suspecting that Rebekah had been sharing gossip about her, a few months before she went public with her alleged findings.</p>
      <p>At that time, 33-year-old Coleen is said to have blocked Rebekah on social media after she became suspicious of her activity on her account.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7560835/Rebekah-Vardy-reveals-confronted-ex-pal-Coleen-Rooney-run-finding-BLOCKED.html">Daily Mail</a> , Rebekah said she confronted Coleen about the move: "I sent her a message and asked her: 'Have I done something, is there a problem here? I seem to be blocked on Instagram.'</p>
      <p>"And she said no, it was probably one of the kids messing about with her phone that had done it.</p>
      <p>"She was completely convincing."</p>
      <p>Sources have claimed that Coleen was completely convinced that Rebekah was the one that had been spreading the 'lies'.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/coleen-rooneys-secret-run-rebekah-20555958">The Mirror</a> , the source said: "Coleen was convinced Vardy was to blame, but had to get the evidence first. Blocking her wasn’t going to cut the mustard... she needed proof."</p>
      <p>At the time, Coleen outed Rebekah's Instagram account as being the only one that could view a number of made up stories which eventually ended up in being reported in the media.</p>
      <p>Rebekah has continuously denied having any involvement in the leaks and said that a number of people had access to her account.</p>

      <p>A source told The Sun that she is trying to find out who is responsible.</p>
      <p>They said: "Rebekah is determined to prove her innocence. She's waiting on the results from the forensic investigation and will prove to Coleen it wasn't her."</p>
