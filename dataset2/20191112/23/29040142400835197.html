      <p>The new era of streaming for Disney has arrived, and people are excited to give Disney+ a try. Streaming video lovers and value shoppers are especially interested in the new Disney+ bundle, which offers three streaming services for one low price.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney+</a> is offering a bundle that has Disney+, ESPN+, and ad-supported Hulu for only $12.99. These services would normally cost almost $18 combined, as individually Disney+ costs $6.99, ESPN+ costs $4.99 and ad-supported Hulu costs $5.99. That adds up to nearly $60 per year in savings, and it offers subscribers a large variety of entertainment and sports options.</p>
      <p>For a lot of you who pick this bundle, this will be your first time taking a look at <a href="https://www.cordcutters.com/what-espn-0">ESPN+</a>. You may be wondering what it is all about, and if it's worth adding to your streaming setup. ESPN+ is a standalone streaming service, so it has its own exclusive games and events that you won't find on any other channel. It normally costs $4.99 per month, and it <a href="https://www.cordcutters.com/espn-plus-free-trial">no longer offers a free trial</a>.</p>
      <p>Here is a quick rundown of the key sports the service offers, and why it should be a fun part of this bundle for all kinds of fans.</p>
      <h3>ESPN+ has live games from major Pro and College sports</h3>
