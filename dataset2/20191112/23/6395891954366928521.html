      <p>MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo says "no impacts anticipated." </p>
      <p>As for the upcoming winter as a whole, commuters have their doubts, telling us, "It's gonna happen, I'm ready for it, unfortunately."</p>
      <p>Since summer's Red Line derailment, the T has been expediting repairs to fortify tracks along multiple lines to make service faster and reduce crowding at platforms and stations. As commuters prepare for a wintry mix, we asked the MBTA what's being done to prepare now for the winter ahead.</p>
      <p>Pesaturo says "It is important to note that all of the work we are doing nights and weekends on the Green, Orange and Red Lines is work that makes the subway more resilient to the impacts of extreme temperatures and/or winter weather conditions."</p>
      <p>MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak spoke Saturday as Orange Line repairs wrapped up, saying work continues every day to be ready. </p>
      <p>"One can't predict what winter will bring, but we are busy preparing for the winter here at the T," said Poftak. "Every time we're able to do these improvements it increases our level of reliability and our level of resilience."</p>
      <p>He also spoke of the horrible winter of 2015, which overwhelmed the system. </p>
      <p>"The winter of 2015 I think was a real turning point for the MBTA. We've made significant investments in our infrastructure, so we're able to better function in the winter," said Poftak. </p>
      <p>Governor Charlie Baker said they've "probably spent $100 million on snow removal equipment so that the system would actually be able to keep up with whatever mother nature sends its way and obviously it's hard to predict what will happen.”</p>
      <p>The MBTA has already done tree trimming along subway and commuter rail right of ways, as well as adding automatic generators at Wellington, Malden and Community College stations. </p>
      <p>The T also wants to remind riders to check apps and the T's website for any schedule changes that may arise. </p>
