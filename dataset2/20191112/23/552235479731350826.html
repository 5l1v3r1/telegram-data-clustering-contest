      <h1>Chelsea's incredible fine system revealed as stars face £20,000 charge for being late to training</h1>
      <h2>The numbers revealed paint a picture of the immense riches on offer down south.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:10:36+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author">PA Sports, Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea have implemented an astonishing system of fines for their young squad - with being late for training netting players a hefty £20,000 punishment.</p>
      <p>The Kings Road club sit third in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> after a brilliant start to the season under new boss Frank Lampard but many will be flabbergasted at the level of financial penalty involved.</p>
      <p>Scottish wonderkid <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/billy-gilmour">Billy Gilmour</a> has been involved in first team action this season and it's safe to say the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> starlet would be hit hard by any infractions.</p>
      <p>Blues players are charged £500 for every minute they are late to team meetings, the <i><b>Daily Record</b> </i>understands.</p>
      <p>Any player not reporting an illness or injury before a day off or an hour-and-a-half before training can expect a £10,000 fine, while lateness for treatment, medical appointments or matchday departure will cost £2,500.</p>
      <p>A phone ringing during a team meal or meeting will set a Chelsea player back £1,000, as will wearing the wrong clothing for team travel or matchdays.</p>
      <p>It is understood the leaked list of penalties, which is entitled ' <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> FC first team internal player fines season 2019-20' and was initially published by the Daily Mail, is accurate.</p>
      <p>The list is dated August 27 and signed by Lampard.</p>
      <p>The fines are doubled if not paid within 14 days, with the money going towards team activities and charities.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Being late for the report time for training will cost players £2,500, plus the same amount for every 15 minutes thereafter.</p>
      <p>Other fines include £5,000 for not turning up to fulfil corporate or community duties, the same amount for not travelling back from a match on the team coach without giving 48 hours notice and £1,000 for a late appearance at the gym.</p>
      <p>Lampard took over at Stamford Bridge in the summer and his strict regime appears to be working, with his side lying third in the Premier League table after a run of six straight league wins.</p>
