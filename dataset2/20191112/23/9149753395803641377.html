      <p>The list of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/google-stadia-launch-games/">Google Stadia launch games</a> was revealed earlier this week, and while Codemasters' <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/grid-review/">Grid</a> reboot won't be among them, it's still expected to launch this year. When it does, it'll come with a new multiplayer mode unavailable on PC or consoles, boasting up to 40 cars on track at the same time.</p>
      <p>The reason this won't be coming to PC? Because Stadia's technology is the only way to make it feasible. GRID development director Mark Green indicated as much in a recent interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grid-has-a-40-car-mode-on-google-stadia-thats-just-not-possible-with-other-hardware/">WCCFTech</a>. Speaking on the differences between developing for Stadia and more conventional platforms, Green singled out the technology's streaming nous.</p>
      <p>"Perhaps the area with the biggest difference was the streaming, but also the ability of Stadia to talk to other Stadia so quickly transforms some ideas around multiplayer – for example developing a whole new mode for GRID Stadia which has 40 cars on track at the same time, something that just isn’t possible with other hardware."</p>
      <p>Green later adds that the 40-car mode is "probably" only scratching the surface of what Google's streaming technology is capable of, but he doesn't go into any more detail regarding why the 40-car mode is only possible with Stadia. In a world of 100 player battle royale games that can run on mobile networks, perhaps there are considerations specific to racing games that makes it harder with non-streaming tech.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/everything-we-know-about-google-stadia/">Google Stadia</a> goes live on November 19.</p>
