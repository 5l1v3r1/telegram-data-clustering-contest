      <h1>Drake Drops Tongue-In-Cheek Response To Being Booed Offstage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:56:46+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:56</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Drake is having a pretty tough time of it.</p>
      <p>Sure, he might be the biggest rapper on the entire planet, a global megastar who tops all the streaming charts. But earlier this week, he suffered through about one of the most humiliating experiences it is possible for a performer to suffer through — he had to stand there onstage while an audience loudly booed him.</p>
      <p>It all went down at Tyler The Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw, where the audience expected to be serenaded by A Secret Performer who they had convinced themselves was to be Frank Ocean. When it was Drake instead, the crowd turned on him. In fact, things got so bad that Drake asked the audience if they wanted him to continue.</p>

      <p>In the fallout of that event, Tyler The Creator has taken to Twitter to alternately chastise his fans and explain that he sorta understands where their anger came from.</p>

      <p>Since the incident, Drake has been silent. That is, until now, with the rapper dropping something of a practical joke on his Camp Flog Gnaw haters.</p>
      <p>“Plot twist,” Drake wrote. “Just signed a 10 year residency at Camp Flog Gnaw, sorry kids see you EVERY SINGLE YEAR till you are 30.”</p>

      <p>That’s genuinely funny! Which is something of a surprise, as Drake’s softboi persona usually doesn’t allow for jokes at all, let alone carefully constructed self-depreciating ones. Turns out the rapper does have a sense of humour after all.</p>
