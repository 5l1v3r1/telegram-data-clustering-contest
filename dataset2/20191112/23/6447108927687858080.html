      <h1>Railroad Corporation steams ahead to full release next week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:02:02+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author">Aran Suddi</a></address>
      <p>Iceberg Interactive has confirmed the full release date for its railway empire building simulator Railroad Corporation, and there’s not a long wait. In fact Railroad Corporation will be released and leave Steam Early Access on November 18th. The early access build currently has one chapter with a few other things including a sandbox mode allowing players to build without limitations such as time and objectives, a challenge mode, and a multiplayer mode.</p>
      <p>The full release will add a second chapter allowing players to create their own companies and battle against an AI which will be trying to meet the same goals that the players are. A stock market will be available in the game too allowing players to buy and sell stocks to fund their fledgling railway companies.</p>
      <p>Will you be able to create a railway that runs on time, and provide a better service than a number of rail companies in the UK? That’s probably one of the easy challenges in the game, to be honest.</p>
