      <p>SPOKANE – Gonzaga had no video of North Dakota to study, so coach Mark Few said his staff improvised on the fly.</p>
      <p>Filip Petrusev had 19 points, 15 rebounds and four blocked shots as the No. 8 Zags used a superior inside game to beat North Dakota 97-66 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Gonzaga outscored the Fighting Hawks 64-32 in the paint.</p>
      <p>“We feel it’s going to be one of our strengths this year,” said Few, citing the play of Petrusev, Drew Timme, Anton Watson and Corey Kispert.</p>
      <p>Kispert scored 20 points, Timme had 16 and Watson added 15 for Gonzaga (3-0), which has won its games by a combined 112 points.</p>
      <p>Marlon Stewart scored 21 points and Filip Rebraca had 16 points and 13 rebounds for North Dakota (1-1), which took the Zags to overtime before losing in Spokane in 2017.</p>
      <p>No such thriller this time, as Gonzaga held the Fighting Hawks to 34.7% shooting and outrebounded them 53-29.</p>
      <p>“Our low-post defense was really good,” Few said. “Filip had a good rebounding night. That’s a good, positive sign for us.”</p>
      <p>The Zags figure to be even stronger inside when forward Killian Tillie returns from knee surgery.</p>
      <p>Few didn’t provide much insight as to when that will occur, saying, “When he’s ready to play, he’ll play.”</p>
      <p>The Zags are likely to face a more demanding test at Texas A&amp;M on Friday.</p>
      <p>“We’re excited to go down there,” Petrusev said. “It’s going to be tough down there.”</p>
      <p>Gonzaga jumped to a 15-2 lead as North Dakota missed eight of its first nine shots.</p>
      <p>Kispert and Admon Gilder each made three-pointers as Gonzaga built a 25-9 lead.</p>
      <p>After North Dakota reduced the Zags’ lead to 30-21, Gonzaga responded with a 14-1 run.</p>
      <p>The Zags shot 57.7% from the field.</p>
      <p>“We really tried to get offensive rebounds and easy baskets,” Petrusev said.</p>
      <p>North Dakota coach Paul Sather said, “We just have to rebound better. We started out a little nervous, but we responded well after the first timeout. We started competing, worrying less about who we were playing against.”</p>
