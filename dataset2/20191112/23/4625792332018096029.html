      <h1>'It's not over': Sarah Palin says she is fighting to repair her marriage</h1>

      <p>Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she learned her husband, Todd, wanted a divorce in an email from his lawyer and that the two are seeking counseling.</p>
      <p>Palin, 55, gave an interview to "Family Talk" founder and Christian broadcaster James Dobson, who <a href="https://drjamesdobson.org/broadcasts/transcript/2019/november/following-god-s-lead-an-interview-with-sarah-palin-part-2/">released</a> the part of the interview that covers Palin's marriage on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I found out from an email from an attorney saying that she was hired, and that was on June 19, I'll never forget it. Then, on Todd's birthday, a week after our 31st anniversary is when he filed," Palin said. "It was devastating. I thought I got shot."</p>
      <p>Claiming it was "<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/impossible-to-live-together-todd-and-sarah-palin-file-for-divorce">impossible to live together,</a>" Todd Palin, 55, filed for divorce in September. Sarah Palin said that she is still fighting to repair her marriage.</p>
      <p>"We're going through counseling now, so it's not 'over' over," she said. "Attorneys are getting rich off of us."</p>
      <p>"To me, in a general sense, marriage is so extremely important as a foundation of our nation. It helps make America that much greater, is that security of family, and Iâ€™m not to the point of wanting mine to be split," she added.</p>
      <p>Dobson asked if listeners could pray for Palin and her family, which includes Trig, 11, and four adult children, Track, 30, Bristol, 29, Willow, 25, and Piper, 18.</p>
      <p>"The prayer would be for, of course, for God's will to be done, but that God would make sure that we know that the grass isn't always greener on the other side," Palin said.</p>
      <p>Sen. John McCain picked Palin as his vice presidential running mate against President Barack Obama in 2008 while Palin was still governor of Alaska. Palin resigned from office in 2009.</p>
