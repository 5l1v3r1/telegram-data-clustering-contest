      <p>Emma Coronel, a former beauty queen and mother of Guzman’s twin girls, attended nearly every day of his 11-week trial in New York, drawing attention for her elegant dress sense. In July, a federal judge sent the kingpin to prison for life.</p>
      <p>In a video clip promoting the show, Coronel, 30, appears on the bow of a luxury yacht in a lacy white blouse and sunglasses, next to a table laid with flutes of Champagne. A man in dark clothing, who appears to be a bodyguard, stands nearby.</p>
      <p>VH1 says “Cartel Crew” aims to offer an insider’s look into how sons and daughters of cartel members are wrestling with their family histories.</p>
      <p>“This docuseries follows their journeys as they set out to live legit lives and make names for themselves outside of the drug world,” the show’s website says.</p>
      <p>Guzman’s name carries heavy weight for Coronel.</p>
      <p>Before his final capture in 2016 and extradition to the United States a year later, Guzman was the world’s most infamous drug trafficker, shipping tonnes of drugs around the world and twice breaking out of maximum security prisons in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Coronel was watching in February when a jury in a federal court in Brooklyn found the boss of the Sinaloa Cartel guilty of drug smuggling and various other criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Coronel has not been charged with any crimes.</p>
      <p>However, a witness at the gang leader’s trial testified that Coronel played an important role in plotting Guzman’s 2015 escape from a Mexican prison and tried to help him break out again after he was recaptured the following January.</p>
