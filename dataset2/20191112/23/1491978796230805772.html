      </p>
      <p>The former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke has announced he will stand as an independent candidate at the general election.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/28/david-gauke-survives-leaveeu-backed-vote-of-no-confidence">former justice secretary</a> said he would contest the South West Hertfordshire seat he has held since 2005.</p>
      <p>Gauke also endorsed calls for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/oct/19/tens-of-thousands-march-for-second-brexit-referendum-in-london-video">second referendum</a>, saying there was no longer any chance of uniting the country around a “relatively soft Brexit”.</p>
      <p>He told the Times: “I represent a form of liberal Conservatism, but the last few months have been increasingly uncomfortable... The principle issue of this general election is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a> and I think that the Conservative party has got it badly wrong.</p>
      <p>“The easy thing to do would be to go quietly but I feel that I have to make a stand and make the case that we are heading towards an outcome that we will deeply regret.”</p>
      <p>Gauke was one of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/03/what-have-tory-rebels-voted-for-and-will-an-election-now-happen">21 MPs kicked out of the Tory party in September</a> after they backed a plan to take control of the Commons timetable to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. He did not have the whip restored and speculation over whether he would stand as an independent candidate in his seat has been rife.</p>
      <p>His decision, coupled with his backing of a second referendum, will put pressure on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/12/lib-dem-candidate-stands-aside-to-avoid-nightmare-of-tory-win">Liberal Democrats</a> to stand their candidate down in the constituency.</p>
      <p>The party’s candidate in Marlow, Buckinghamshire has stood aside to make room <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/dominic-grieve-campaign-trail-beaconsfield">for another ex-Tory, Dominic Grieve, to stand</a>. Like Gauke, the former attorney general was one of the 21 MPs expelled in September.</p>
