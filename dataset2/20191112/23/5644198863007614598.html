      <p>Dean Foods Co said on Tuesday it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, months after the owner of TruMoo chocolate milk and Meadow Gold ice creams ended a strategic review and decided to remain as a standalone firm.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Dean Foods Co said on Tuesday it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, months after the owner of TruMoo chocolate milk and Meadow Gold ice creams ended a strategic review and decided to remain as a standalone firm.</p>
      <p>The Texas-based firm said it was in talks over a potential sale of its assets with Dairy Farmers of America, a company owned by farmers.</p>

      <p>Dean Foods has been struggling in recent years as health-conscious U.S. consumers shift to non-dairy and private-label alternatives.</p>
      <p>"We continue to be impacted by a challenging operating environment marked by continuing declines in consumer milk consumption," Chief Executive Officer Eric Beringause said.</p>
      <p>The company said it has received a US$850 million debtor-in-possession commitment from certain of its existing lenders, led by Rabobank, to keep its operations running.</p>
      <p>Dean Foods, which has a market valuation of about US$74 million, had a net debt of about US$968 million at the end of June.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the company explored options, including a sale, but ended that review in September and decided to execute a "standalone" operating plan under a new CEO.</p>
      <p>The company said substantially all of its subsidiaries were part of the proceeding, which has been filed in the Southern District of Texas.</p>
