      <p>In Mumbai, India, the Western Railway deployed a police officer dressed as Yamarāja, a Hindu god of death, to educate commuters about railway safety and enforce the laws. From <a href="https://zeenews.india.com/india/western-railway-deploys-yamraj-to-teach-commuters-on-rail-safety-2244703.html">Zee News</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Railway Ministry's handle warned the people in Hindi, "Do not cross the track in an unauthorised manner, it can be fatal." <br/><br/>"If you cross the track in an unauthorized way, then Yamraj will be standing in front of you," Railway Ministry added. <br/><br/>In 2018, as many as seven people on an average lost their lives on a daily basis due to carelessness in crossing railway tracks illegitimately. At least 1,476 people had lost their lives while crossing the railway tracks while over 650 people died after falling off the trains.</blockquote>
