      <h1>Lebanon protests turn deadly as local party official killed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:35:17+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:35</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p>A local <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east">Lebanese</a> political official was killed by soldiers trying to open a road in southern Beirut Tuesday, the first death in four weeks of unrest and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-politics">nationwide protests</a>.</p>
      <p>The unidentified man was a member of Lebanon's Progressive Socialist Party (PSP). An army statement said the man was shot in the Khaldeh neighborhood when a soldier opened fire to disperse a crowd near a road closed by protesters.</p>
      <p>The soldier was arrested and the army is investigating the shooting.</p>
      <p>Walid Jumblatt, leader of the PSP and a leader of the country's Druze community, told an angry crowd outside the hospital where the man died that "no one will protect us but the state."</p>

      <p>Tensions have mounted in Lebanon amid weeks of unprecedented protests sparked by an economic crisis, not the sectarian violence seen in previous conflicts in the Middle Eastern nation.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations were initially triggered by a cash-strapped government proposal to tax calls made on messaging applications such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech">WhatsApp</a>. The protests have expanded to calls for a new government and for political elites to step down.</p>
      <p>Protesters closed a number of roads on Tuesday after President Michel Aoun said there could be delays before a new government is formed, adding that the best option is for a new Cabinet made up of both politicians and technocrats.</p>

      <p>Protesters have adamant that no politicians be included. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/lebanons-prime-minister-to-resign-amid-mass-protests">Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned</a> with his government on Oct. 29 following the start of the nationwide demonstrations.</p>
      <p>"I cannot say before the consultations end," he said when asked if he would form a new government.</p>
      <p>Many protesters are demanding a government that would immediately work to implement reforms to halt Lebanon's worst economic crisis in decades.</p>

      <p>Before leaving office, Hariri said the messaging tax would generate around $200 million annually. The country has some of the highest mobile costs in the region, as it only has two state-owned providers.</p>
      <p>Aoun warned protesters to not withdraw their money from banks, promising the funds will be "guaranteed." Banks were supposed to reopen Tuesday following a three-day closure but remained closed after employees went on strike, with some complaining of aggressive behavior from customers.</p>
