      <p>Hillary Clinton attacked the British press for engaging in what she claimed is targeted racism and sexism against Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.</p>
      <p>"I think absolutely there's a racist and a sexist element to what's going on here," the former secretary of state <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07tqq3g">said</a> Tuesday on BBC Radio 5, while promoting her new book <i>Gutsy Women</i>. "To think that some of your, what we would call mainstream media, actually allowed that to be printed in their pages, or amplified, was heartbreaking and wrong."</p>
      <p>"She is an amazing young woman; she has an incredible life story. She has stood up for herself, she has made her own way in the world. And then she falls in love, and he falls in love with her, and everybody should be celebrating that because it is a true love story," Clinton said. "I feel, as a mother, I just want to put my arms around her. Oh my god, I want to hug her. I want to tell her to hang in there, donâ€™t let those bad guys get you down."</p>
      <p>The two-time presidential contender suggested Meghan use "some humor" and "deflection" as techniques to cope with the criticism. "But it is tough what she is going through, and I think she deserves a lot better," Clinton added.</p>
      <p>Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-announce-royal-baby-boy">had a baby boy</a> earlier this year. She is a retired American actress, and her husband, Prince Harry, is the son of Prince Charles and the younger brother to Prince William, who are both in line to the British throne.</p>
      <p>Clinton also said in her interview with BBC Radio 5 that she is <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hillary-clinton-im-under-enormous-pressure-to-run-in-2020">"under enormous pressure" to run</a> for president in 2020. She has teased a third presidential run in the past several months, saying in another interview, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-can-beat-him-again-hillary-clinton-teases-2020-run">"I can beat" Trump again</a>.</p>
