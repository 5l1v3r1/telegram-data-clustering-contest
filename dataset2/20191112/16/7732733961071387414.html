      <h1>Star Wars episodes I through VII are on Disney+ in 4K with Dolby Vision HDR</h1>
      <h2>Rejoice, Star Wars fans</h2>

      <h4>What just happened? Disney+ is here, and with it comes a slew of Star Wars content. While we knew about The Mandalorian and the movies appearing on the service, one thing Disney didn’t mention was episodes I through VII being remastered in 4K with Dolby Vision HDR and Atmos support.</h4>
      <p>A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi have all been revamped and updated, as have the prequels and episode VII: The Force Awakens. It’s worth pointing out that the originals are the 'Greedo shot first' Special Editions.</p>
      <p>Up until now, only The Force Awakens, Rogue One, The Last Jedi, and Solo: A Star Wars Story had 4K editions, and none offered Dolby Vision.</p>
      <p>Engadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/star-wars-movie-4K-disney-plus-dolby-vision-atmos/?utm_campaign=homepage&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_source=dl">writes</a> that based on the demo setup, the image looks pristine, sharp, and detailed, “with no ugly edge enhancement and a healthy dose of film grain.” Dolby Vision HDR, meanwhile, reportedly adds depth and nuance to scenes.</p>
      <p>In the run-up to today’s launch, Disney posted a tweet revealing some extra Marvel movies that will be available at launch. These include Guardians of the Galaxy and GOTG volume 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, The Avengers, Thor, and Doctor Strange.</p>

      <p>Those without Disney+ who want to watch the original Star Wars trilogy in 4K might be able to buy the long-rumored 4K box set, which could arrive next year. But for all things Star Wars and Marvel, Disney+ looks like the best option right now.</p>
