      <p>Grieving Daniel Osbourne is dealt another devastating blow in next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> when he finds his flat has been trashed while he was at <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-streets-daniel-and-sinead-the-history-of-their-relationship/">wife Sinead's</a> funeral.</p>
      <p>As the day of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-katie-mcglynn-the-actress-who-plays-sinead-tinker/">Sinead's</a> funeral arrives, and her friends and family brace themselves to say their final goodbyes.</p>

      <p>The service goes well and as everyone gathers in The Rovers for the wake, it seems Sinead has got the send off that she planned.</p>

      <p>However, while everyone celebrates <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-sinead-dies-in-daniels-arms/">Sinead's short life,</a> little do they realise a mysterious figure has broken into Daniel's flat and is riffling through his and Sinead's belongings.</p>

      <p>Just when Daniel thought life couldn't deal him any more heartache, he gets home to the flat after the funeral to find it has been trashed by the thief... but that's not all he has to worry about.</p>
      <p>As he calls Peter in his moment of need, Carla takes Daniel to Ken's house so that Peter can call the police.</p>
      <p>But while Peter is there he realises that the thief took Daniel's laptop... the one with all the video messages that Sinead made for Daniel and Bertie before she died.</p>

      <p>Daniel is understandably devastated at the news about the computer and decides to take matters into his own hands by heading to the local pawn shops to see if he can find his laptop.</p>
      <p>It doesn't take long for Daniel to think he has found his stolen laptop in a glass cabinet in a shop, and he is a man on the edge as he accuses the shop owner of handing stolen goods.</p>
      <p>In a moment of rage he finds a golf club nearby and smashes the cabinet... causing the police to be called.</p>

      <p>The police are soon on the scene and Daniel finds himself arrested for his behaviour... but will Craig manage to persuade the shop owner to drop the charges by explaining that Daniel is grieving for his wife?</p>
      <p>Later Daniel breaks down in tears, telling Adam that Bertie deserves a better dad, and Peter is concerned that Daniel isn't in a good place at all.</p>
      <p>As Daniel decides to clear up the flat after the break in, it seems he is looking brighter... until he finds a broken mug that belonged to Sinead, and he breaks down in tears once again, devastated that his has happened so soon after losing the love of his life.</p>

      <p>Eventually Beth comes to visit Daniel at the flat and finds him a broken mess on the floor, and offers him a shoulder to cry on... but will her support be enough to help him through this difficult time?</p>

      <p>Later Peter and Carla finally manage to persuade Daniel to have some 'me time' and they look after Bertie while he has a break... but it seems their good intentions have made things worse when he comes home worse for wear.</p>
