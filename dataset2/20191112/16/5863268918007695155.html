      <p>Abhinandan’s MiG-21 jet was shot down by a Pakistani fighter during a clash over Kashmir. The plane crashed on the Pakistani side of the de facto border that separates the two sides of Kashmir, a Himalayan region that has been a source of hostility between the two countries since independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
