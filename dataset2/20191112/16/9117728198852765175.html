      <p>Ricciardo returns to Interlagos this year with Renault after finishing a highest of P4 in Brazil last year around a track that can be difficult to overtake.<br/> <br/>Previous races have had mixed weather throughout with heavy rain coming and going back in 2016 making for an entertaining viewing.</p>
      <p><i>“Interlagos is a short circuit without many high-speed corners. It’s very technical and you need to find a good rhythm to do well there,” </i>said Ricciardo.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Overtaking can be difficult, but I’ve come through the field a couple of times there in the past, so it is possible to gain places.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The weather is usually interesting too. It can play a big part and you have to be ready for all conditions.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Australian and Renault head into Brazil in their best form of the season having secured two double points finishes in Mexico and the US and finding the performances they had been looking for since the start.</p>
      <p><i>“Austin was a fun race with some good points in the bag for the team,” </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We secured double points across both Mexico and the United States, which was really positive after a few races where we missed out.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s important to keep the consistency going and Brazil is our next opportunity.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Three points-scoring finishes in a row would be sweet, so it’ll be all focus on achieving that when we hit the track on Friday. Viva Brazil!”</i>
