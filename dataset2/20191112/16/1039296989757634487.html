      <p>Rugged version of the Mitsubishi Xpander MPV will go on sale in Indonesia first; India launch unconfirmed.</p>
      <p>Mitsubishi has taken the wraps off the Xpander Cross, which is essentially a rugged alternative to the standard Xpander MPV. The model will first go on sale in Indonesia and then will be introduced in other ASEAN markets.</p>
      <p>The Xpander Cross gets the same body panels as the Xpander MPV but with a number of tweaks to distinguish itself from the standard model. What helps differentiate it from the standard Xpander is that it gets a new front bumper with a skid plate to give it more road presence. It also gets a new grille finished in black rather than chrome. Also, the rugged variant gets new LED headlamps and LED foglamps. The Xpander Cross gets black body cladding all around, restyled 17-inch wheels with larger profile tyres, new roof rails and a rear new bumper with a faux skid plate. </p>
      <p>On the inside, the Cross gets an all-black interior with higher variants sporting a dual-tone black and red theme. </p>
      <p>In addition to these cosmetic changes, the Xpander Cross also gets an additional 25mm of ground clearance over the standard model, at 225mm. It is also 50mm wider.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, the Xpander gets the same 1.5-litre petrol engine as the Xpander and will be sold as a front-wheel-drive only. The model will be built at Mitsubishi’s Indonesia plant and will be exported to other ASEAN markets later.</p>
      <p>As far as India is concerned, Mitsubishi has no plans to bring the Xpander to our shores anytime soon. The carmaker currently has the Outlander on sale in our market. Read more about it <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mitsubishi/outlander">here</a></b>. </p>
