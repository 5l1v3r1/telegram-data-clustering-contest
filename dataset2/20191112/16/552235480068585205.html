      <h1>Dumfries and Galloway Council officials consult on ideas to bridge £12 million funding gap</h1>
      <h2>Community conversations are being held on the ideas, which include council tax increases and hiking marina fees</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:03:37+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Temlett, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stephen-temlett/</a></address>
      <p>Further council tax increases and cutting the number of secondary school subjects offered to pupils are two methods the local authority may use to bridge a £12million funding gap.</p>
      <p>The council has already agreed savings of just over £3m for next year but needs to find much more.</p>
      <p>And it has drawn up a list of options to cut costs which also includes reducing the roads maintenance budget and a 30 per cent reduction in events funding.</p>
      <p>The council has emphasised that no decision has been made but staff will hold a series of “community conversations” over the next month to get the public’s feedback.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report states: “We continue to face huge challenges with more budget cuts a reality over the next three years.</p>
      <p>“Forecasts of our budget show the council can expect to have £49m less to spend on services and resources. This is nearly 15 per cent of our current budget over that period and is in addition to almost £106m that has been cut since 2010.</p>
      <p>“The council’s agreed budget timetable required council officers to prepare a summary of options to close the council’s funding gap for 2020/21.</p>
      <p>“No decisions on these options have been taken. All these options will be considered by councillors over the next few <br/>months.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Feedback from citizens, customers, staff and partners will be reported to councillors at a full council meeting on December 17 to inform their decisions when setting their budget for 2020/21 in February 2020.”</p>
      <p>As well as cuts, which also include the reconfiguration of social work staffing, the budget options also look at ways the council could increase its income.</p>
      <p>A three per cent council tax rise for the next two years would eventually generate an extra £6.8m for the council coffers.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">Other methods suggested include increasing fees for Stranraer and Kirkcudbright marinas, removal of free access to leisure facilities for talented athletes and “move towards full cost recovery” for burial services.</a>
