      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/securities-appellate-tribunal">Securities Appellate Tribunal </a>on Wednesday is likely to hear an appeal by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/reliance-industries">Reliance Industries </a>Ltd against a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>order that had barred the company and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives.</p>
      <p>The watchdog had barred the company and the entities for alleged unfair trade practices related to the securities market.</p>
      <p>Through an order on March 24, 2017, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>had also directed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ril">RIL </a>to disgorge Rs 447 crore along with interest.</p>
      <p>The total amount of disgorgement, including interest, was around Rs 1,952 crore.</p>
      <p>SAT would hear RIL's appeal against the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>ban on Wednesday, as per the tribunal's cause list.</p>
      <p>Noted lawyer Harish Salve would be appearing for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ril">RIL.</a></p>
      <p>The case dates back to March 2007, when Mukesh Ambani-led <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ril">RIL </a>decided to sell 5 per cent stake in Reliance Petroleum, a listed subsidiary which was later merged with RIL in 2009.</p>
      <p>Sebi ruling was related to alleged fraudulent trading in the F&amp;O space in the securities of Reliance Petroleum.</p>
      <p>RIL and the 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives in the F&amp;O segment of stock exchanges.</p>
