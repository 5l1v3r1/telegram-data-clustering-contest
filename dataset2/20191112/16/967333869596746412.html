      <p><a href="https://www.miss-international.org/en/">Miss International Beauty Pageant originated</a> in Long Beach, California, United States in 1960.</p>
      <p>In 1970, Japan had an opportunity to co-host the pageant with Japan World Exposition in Osaka, as the main event of the Osaka World Expo.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Miss Japan had won a prize, ending up in 4th place to standing ovations from the public.</p>
      <p>The spike in popularity of the contest became the catalyst for further contests to take place in Japan, with the pageants mainly hosted by the Asian country.</p>
