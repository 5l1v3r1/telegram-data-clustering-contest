      <h1>Emily Yacina Learns to Let Go on New Single "Bleachers"</h1>

      <p>Emily Yacina’s name might be new to you, but it’s likely her voice won’t be, at least not if you’re a (Sandy) Alex G fan: <i>House of Sugar</i>’s mesmerizing “<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/08/alex-g-new-song-emily-yacina.html">Southern Sky</a>,” <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/paste-review-of-the-day-sandy-alex-g---rocket.html">Rocket</a></i> standout “Bobby,” and <i>Beach Music</i>’s “Mud” (which also features her in its <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/alex-g-shares-serene-video-for-mud.html">video</a>) have Yacina’s harmonies to thank for their depth of beauty and feeling. Yacina has been a fixture of the Pennsylvania and New York DIY scenes for some time now, with a wealth of recordings available on <a href="https://emilyyacina.bandcamp.com/music">Bandcamp</a>. On Dec. 4, she’s set to release her debut studio album, titled <i>Remember the Silver</i>. Last month, she dropped the seemingly Blink-182-indebted lead single “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-ZJiAOZoZU">Gleaming</a>,” and today (Nov. 12), we’ve got another taste of the record with “Bleachers.”</p>
      <p>“This song is about how people can stay in your life for a long time, and how losing them can feel like losing a part of your own identity,” says Yacina. “Bleachers” is suffused with a melancholy nostalgia: Its soft, sparkly guitars and harmonies feel both heavy and weightless. “Time is a silk web,” she sings, and “Bleachers” feels much the same, with a tangle of oppressive emotions lurking just beneath its lush veneer—but in admitting she’s “stuck in [her] story,” Yacina gives herself the chance to get free.</p>
