      <h2>Abbie Nesbit, 23, from Runcorn in Cheshire, gave birth to her stillborn son after the attack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:09:58+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Ralph Blackburn, Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>A mum-to-be lost her first baby after an intruder allegedly battered her when he forced his way into her home.</p>
      <p>Abbie Nesbit, 23, from Runcorn, Cheshire, said a thug broke into her house and flung her across a table in a rage which led to her water breaking when she was 13 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>Medics found no liquid around the baby in the coming weeks, and Abbie gave birth to her stillborn son Jamie at 20 weeks.</p>
      <p>She was distraught to find her attacker was only charged with assault because Jamie died at less than 24 weeks.</p>
      <p>Now Abbie wants to change the law to protect other mums who lose their babies in brutal attacks.</p>

      <p>She said: “It won’t help us, but at least baby Jamie will have a legacy forever.</p>
      <p>“We want to protect women and unborn babies.</p>
      <p>“Who is someone else to prevent that pregnancy from going any further.”</p>
      <p>At the moment, unborn babies are not recognised in law until they are at 24 weeks gestation, the age medics say they would be viable outside the womb.</p>
      <p>Abbie and her family want this changed to 16 weeks, when a heartbeat can clearly be seen on a scan.</p>
      <p>A petition started by Abbie’s father, Luke Bryant, to bring in ‘Jamie’s Law’ has had more than 7,200 signatures.</p>
      <p>Luke, 44, said hundreds of women have got in touch to say similar assaults have happened to them.</p>
      <p>“The amount of responses we have had is really heartbreaking,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It has struck a chord with so many people.”</p>

      <p>Luke explained Abbie was “ecstatic” to have her first child.</p>
      <p>She had named the little one after the tot’s dad Jamie Bennett, 26.</p>
      <p>Abbie had moved back to the family home and wanted to return to university so Jamie could have the best possible life.</p>
      <p>However, her dreams were shattered during the violent assault in the early hours of August 11. </p>
      <p>Abbie was woken at 5am by a banging at the door.</p>
      <p>Her dad Luke worked nights, and her disabled neighbour sometimes needed help, so she quickly rushed to the door.</p>
      <p>But a shocked Abbie says she found a drunk man waiting for her.</p>

      <p>She told him to go away, but he smashed the door towards her knocking the mum-to-be off her feet.</p>
      <p>Abbie’s mother Michelle and two younger sisters were sleeping upstairs, and she was desperate to protect them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She says she tried to block to door upstairs, but the thug hurled her across a table.</p>
      <p>“He kept throwing me back against the table,” she said.</p>
      <p>Hearing noises upstairs the intruder fled, but Abbie thinks the damage was done.</p>
      <p>“I had dropped down to the floor with the pain in my stomach, I could feel water,” Abbie explained.</p>
      <p>“I had to go to the bathroom and get changed I was so damp.</p>
      <p>“I was in so much pain, I was in agony.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t walk and I was bleeding, I was really worried about baby Jamie.”</p>

      <p>After giving a statement to the police, Abbie went to hospital - however she was told the discharge was normal.</p>
      <p>She worried: “I kept waking up in the night and having to get changed twice.”</p>
      <p>Then on September 10, a scan confirmed her amniotic fluid was leaking.</p>
      <p>“There was nothing left,” Abbie said.</p>
      <p>“I was told the baby had a 1 per cent chance of survival.”</p>
      <p>She was offered an abortion, but kept Jamie in the slimmest of hopes he might survive.</p>
      <p>On September 26, Abbie woke up and had started to give birth.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She was rushed to hospital, and was tragically told that her baby was dead.</p>
      <p>Devastated Abbie had a stillbirth that evening.</p>
      <p>Jamie was buried in a tiny white coffin, scattered with blue and white flowers and carried by his dad.</p>
      <p>Abbie’s attacker was charged with assault, but as Jamie was less than 24 weeks’ gestation he couldn’t be linked to the death.</p>
      <p>At the time Abbie was too devastated to go to court, and the case has now been discontinued by the CPS.</p>
      <p>“I had a scan before the attack, and his brain was perfect,” Abbie said.</p>
      <p>“After the incident my waters were leaking.</p>
      <p>“How is this allowed?”</p>
      <p>Now the family is campaigning to change the law.</p>
      <p>Currently thugs who assault pregnant women - and cause them to lose their babies - can be charged with child destruction, if the baby is after 24 weeks gestation.</p>
      <p>Dad Luke, who launched the petition, said: “How many more people have to go through this before something is done about it?</p>
      <p>“You go to funerals and the coffins are usually massive, but when you see one that’s that small it hits home.</p>
      <p>“This law needs to be in place to protect our children.</p>
      <p>“We always say how much our children mean, and even the unborn ones need our protection.</p>
      <p>“It’s devastated our family - we’ve lost a family member, we’ve lost so many things we could have done together.</p>
      <p>“It would also help victims of domestic violence, I want to give them a voice.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But the family are clear they don’t want it to impact the abortion law.</p>
      <p>“It’s got nothing to do with that as far as I’m concerned,” Abbie added.</p>
      <p>“If you plan to keep a pregnancy who is someone else to prevent that.”</p>
      <p>A CPS spokesman said: “The CPS has a duty to keep cases under continuing review and we concluded there was not sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.</p>
      <p>“We recognise this has been a distressing experience for all concerned.”</p>
      <p>Cheshire Police confirmed officers attended a domestic disturbance in Runcorn at 5am on August 11.</p>
      <p>Police said a man was subsequently charged with two counts of assault by beating in connection with incident.</p>
      <p>"The case against him has since been discontinued by the CPS," a spokesman added added.</p>
