      <p>Donald Trump has surprisingly scrubbed a Twitter post endorsing his former spokesperson on <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>, the US analogue of <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>In a now-deleted tweet on Monday, Trump wrote: “Vote for Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars. He is a great and very loyal guy who is working very hard. He is in the quarterfinals – all the way with Sean.”</blockquote>
      <p>Spicer was the White House press secretary during the first six months of Trump’s presidency; <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201707211055768625-sean-cpicer-resigns-press-secretary/">he resigned in July 2017</a>, reportedly over his opposition to the appointment of Anthony Scaramucci as director of communications.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, Sean Spicer was voted off the competition due to a combination of low marks from the judges and viewers. Spicer had received the lowest scores from the judges each week for the past month, since the departure of Lamar Odom, but there’s a widespread assumption that viewers had helped him survive with their votes because of his White House stint and not because of his dancing skills.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump replaced his deleted tweet was with another one praising Spicer for a “good try.” The latter, in turn, thanked the president for his “continued support.”</p>

      <p>Trump is not particularly known for deleting his tweets, and virtually all of his most controversial messages are still on. His previous Spicer-praising tweets remain untouched as well.</p>
      <p>Some people have suggested that Trump might have taken Spicer’s defeat too personally.</p>
      <p>“It’s almost as if he can’t abide the fact that his endorsement lacks sufficient power,” one commenter wrote.</p>

      <p>Others just couldn’t help but deride Trump as the exact opposite of Midas.</p>
