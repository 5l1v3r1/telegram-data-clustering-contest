      <h1>Galaxy S10 Gets More Note 10 Features With The Latest Update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:59:50+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/ADSoomeet</a></address>
      <p>Samsung's already great Galaxy S10 smartphones are set to get even better. The company has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/experience-more-powerful-note10-features-on-the-galaxy-s10">announced</a> a new software update for this year's Galaxy S flagships. The update introduces several Galaxy Note 10-exclusive features to the four smartphones. The Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, and the S10 5G will all be getting features like Auto Hotspot, quick multimedia and device controls, smart gallery, and more with the new update.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> says the latest software update brings "a more streamlined and seamless user experience" to the Galaxy S10 phones. As always, feature availability may vary by country, though. Some of the new features may not be available in all markets.</p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S10 update: new features</h3>
      <p>To start with, the latest software update for the Samsung Galaxy S10 brings refinement to the Gallery app. The app now allows users to quickly search for a photo with the help of keywords. You can use keywords like "cats", "dogs", "nature", or any color or location, and all related images will show up, much like you can do in Google Photos.</p>

      <p>Not just the gallery, but this refined search works across the device. Samsung says this improved device search not only brings up content from within the device but from multimedia streaming apps as well. Samsung has also added Media &amp; Devices to the Quick Panel, allowing you to easily control your multimedia, as well as paired devices, with the Galaxy S10.</p>
      <p>The latest software update also brings Note 10's Auto Hotspot function to the Galaxy S10. With this feature, your Galaxy S10 works as a Wi-Fi hub for your other Samsung devices if they share the same Samsung account or family account. Intelligent Wi-Fi Tips will make sure that you enjoy a stable and secure internet connection by offering you troubleshooting guides and alerts whenever necessary.</p>
      <p>This is the second such update where Samsung has brought features from the Note 10 to the Galaxy S10 phones. The company rolled out a similar <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/09/samsung-brings-galaxy-note-10-features-to-the-galaxy-s10-lineup.html">update</a> back in September as well. That update introduced features like AR Doodle, DeX for PC support, Link for Windows, and some camera enhancements.</p>

      <p>Samsung says the release date for the latest update may vary by country as well as carrier. That said, it should be available for most Galaxy S10 phones over the next few weeks. You should get a notification once the update becomes available for your Galaxy S10. You can also manually trigger the update by going to the Software update section of the Settings app on your phone.</p>
