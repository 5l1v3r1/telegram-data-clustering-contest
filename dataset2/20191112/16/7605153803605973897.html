        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 12 – The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) has confirmed that striker Mohammed Salah will miss the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Kenya’s Harambee Stars on Thursday due to an ankle injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Salah picked up the injury playing for his club Liverpool in Sunday’s crunch English premier League match against Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Liverpool had insisted that Salah had to remain at the club’s training ground in Melwood to assess his situation, but the forward is said to have insisted on travelling to Cairo to be examined by the club’s medical team.</p>
      <p>The EFA confirmed his unavailability and posted a photo of him wearing a supportive boot together with his teammates at the Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria.</p>
      <p>His absence will remove one threat off Francis Kimanzi’s plan for the game on Thursday night though even in his unavailability, the Pharaohs still possess enough firepower to trouble Kenya’s Stars.</p>
      <p>The EFA also confirmed Salah will miss the game against Comoros on Monday.</p>
