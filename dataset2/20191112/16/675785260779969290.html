      <p>Kim Kardashian has been branded "tone deaf" for plugging a product launch in Australia as the country battles devastating bush fires.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star, 39, filmed a video for her fans in Oz letting them know about a new project.</p>
      <p>She didn't reveal what it is, but some speculated it could be a pop-up shop or a new beauty product.</p>
      <p>Kim tweeted: "Hi Australia! I have some exciting news coming soon just in time for the holidays.</p>
      <p>"Can you guess what is is? Stay tuned for the big announcement..."</p>
      <p>She added in the video: "Hey Australia, I just wanted to let you know I am sending you something very special..."</p>
      <p>The post enraged her Aussie fans, who bombarded her with messages telling her they hope she's sending water or a donation to help firefighters Down Under.</p>
      <p>Others called Kim out for tweeting about one of her money-spinning projects during the country's time of need.</p>
