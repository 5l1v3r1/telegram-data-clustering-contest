      <h1>Fish With a Pretty Convincing Human-Like Face Is Out There So Don't Think People Aren't Catching On</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:42:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/cady-lang/" target="_blank">Cady Lang</a></address>
      <p>While some humans are notorious for making a “fish face” while mugging for a photo, there’s now a fish that’s gone viral for its remarkable resemblance to a human.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://time.com/5721116/teen-tik-tok-history-lessons-videos/">TikTok</a> video on Twitter that’s been making the rounds online, a fish can be seen swimming in a stream before lifting its head out of the water to reveal a visage that bears an uncanny similarity to a land-dwelling, two-legged human being in its eyes, nose and mouth. The succinct caption that accompanies the tweet simply (and pithily) reads: “This face has human face,” alongside a slew of anxious, grimacing face emoji.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/this-fish-with-a-human-face-is-just-what-nightmares-are-made-of-2381723.html"><i>News 18</i></a>, the video was captured by a visitor to the Miao village in Kunming, China; it was later shared on Weibo and then TikTok. The TikTok video has now garnered 23.6k views.</p>
