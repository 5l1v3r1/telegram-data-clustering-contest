      <h1>Branson apologises to S.Africa for racially exclusionary tweet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:04:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Johannesburg (AFP) - British billionaire and Virgin founder Richard Branson apologised on Tuesday for posting a picture on Twitter he admitted "clearly lacked diversity" as he launched his new entrepreneurship development centre in South Africa.</p>
      <p>On Monday he tweeted a picture of himself and eight others captioned "We aim to become the heart of entrepreneurship in Southern Africa".</p>
      <p>It featured no blacks in a country where they make up 80 percent of the population.</p>
      <p>That sparked outrage as racial tensions remain high and the majority black population is still economically marginalised 25 years after the demise of apartheid.</p>
      <p>"Where did you find so many white people in South Africa?" one tweet said.</p>
      <p>"I wish there were more BLACK entrepreneurs in this picture," @NomsBomba said.</p>
      <p>Following the flurry of angry and sarcastic tweets targeting the mogul, who runs a chain of gyms in South Africa and whose airline daily flies the London-Johannesburg route, Branson deleted the tweet and apologised.</p>
      <p>"The Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship is for all South Africans, but yesterday's choice of a photo to go with my tweet clearly lacked diversity. Apologies," he said.</p>
      <p>The centre serves as business development hub aimed at supporting entrepreneurs.</p>
