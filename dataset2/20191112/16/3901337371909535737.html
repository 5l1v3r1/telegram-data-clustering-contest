      <p>Mourinho enjoyed great success during his two spells with Chelsea, with whom he won three league titles, but the Portuguese manager believes one of the Blues' rivals will claim the coveted Premier League trophy this season.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Liverpool's 3-1 win over Manchester City on Sunday, the 56-year-old predicted that the Reds will walk away with the EPL title if they claimed victory over the Citizens.  </p>

      <p>"I think (Reds manager) Jurgen (Klopp) cannot say it but I can, I think nine points is, for a very good team, it's a difference that you just have to control," Mourinho said, as reported by the<i> Liverpool Echo.</i></p>
      <p>"So I would say that if Liverpool win the game today (Sunday), they will win the league."</p>
      <p>Liverpool ultimately claimed all three points courtesy of goals from Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane to open up a nine-point gap over City, who were also overtaken in the league standings by Chelsea and Leicester City in the race for this season's title.</p>
