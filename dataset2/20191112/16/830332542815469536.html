      <p>MILWAUKEE - An icy airmass moving through Wisconsin is keeping temperatures in the single digits with additional snow forecast for parts of the state.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for Vilas County in northern Wisconsin where 3 to 6 inches of additional snow was expected Tuesday. Monday's snowfall dumped 5.8 inches in the southeastern community of Wind Point and 3.7 inches in Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>Temperatures slid below zero in the southern Wisconsin city of Elkhorn early Tuesday where it was minus 1.</p>
      <p>Overnight warming shelters opened for the first time this year in Milwaukee Monday night, the earliest opening that one organizer can recall. Capuchin Community Services director Robert Wotypka tells WISN-TV that last year they didn't open until around Dec. 20.</p>
