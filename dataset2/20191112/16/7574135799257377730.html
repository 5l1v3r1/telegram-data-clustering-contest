      <p>Boston post-hardcore turned indie rock vets Piebald have been <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/piebald-announce-2016-reunion-tour/">reunited</a> since 2016, but they haven’t released new music since 2007 (not counting <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/piebald-re-rele/">unearthed material</a> from their initial run that came out alongside the reunion), but now they’re finally back with new music for the first time in 12 years in the form of… a Christmas EP. It’s called <i>Piebald Presents To You, A Musical Christmas Adventure</i>, it’s due out this Friday (11/15) via Photo Finish Records, and it’ll include three original Christmas songs, including the just-released “(All I Want For Christmas Is To) Rage With My Friends.” It’s in the long lineage of comedic Christmas songs, and it’s got the obligatory sleigh bells, but it also sounds like Piebald and it’s pretty exciting to hear new material from them again. It’s fun, funny stuff, and you can listen below.</p>
      <p>The band is also playing <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-flosstradamus-elbow-oysterhead-the-heavy-piebald-more/">holiday shows</a> in New England and <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/dashboard-confessional-celebrating-20th-anniversary-with-full-albums-tour-compilation/">touring with Dashboard Confessional</a> in 2020. Here’s what they say about the holiday EP and shows:</p>
      <blockquote>This whole sonic and photographic project escalated quickly, but it started from knowing that Christmas shows are happening again this coming winter season. We are hoping to make the most of those few shows and we thought making or covering a Christmas song or two would be a fun idea. As it turns out, we’re much more about making than we are about covering. Maybe you’re thinking, “This is weird of Piebald, who haven’t made new music since 2007 to musically rebirth themselves with a 3-song holiday release.” Well, our response to you is this, “You’re not wrong. However, we have never really done anything the right or proper way. Weirdly it’s just how we do things at camp Piebald.</blockquote>
