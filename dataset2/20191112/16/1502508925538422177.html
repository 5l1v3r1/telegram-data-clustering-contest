      <h1>Uber gives another push to its India plans with Rs 1,767-cr investment</h1>
      <h2>Says it is the biggest tranche of capital infusion to Uber India by parent company</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:38:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Peerzada Abrar</a></address>
      <p>Ride-hailing major <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber">Uber </a>has infused Rs 1,767 crore in fresh capital into its Indian entity, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber">Uber </a>India Systems Private Limited.</p>
      <p>According to the company’s regulatory filings sourced from business intelligence platform Paper.vc, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber">Uber </a>India has allotted 11.12 million equity shares, valuing Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 1,578.20 to the Netherlands-based entities Uber International Holding BV and Uber International BV.</p>
      <p>The board of directors of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-india">Uber India </a>passed this resolution at a meeting held on October 29, 2019, the company filing says. This was around the time Uber Technologies’ Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi was on a visit to India.</p>
      <p>Uber has already transferred its Indian ride sharing and Uber Eats business to Indian entity <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-india">Uber India </a>System from the Netherlands entity. The capital infusion is expected to bolster its presence in the country by funding its key businesses to take on Indian rival Ola.</p>
      <p>“This is the single-largest foreign direct investment by Uber into its Indian operations and follows the transfer of its India business from a Dutch entity to an Indian entity,” said Vivek Durai, founder of Paper.vc.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In its board meeting held on October 1, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-india">Uber India </a>board had passed a resolution to allot close to 15.99 million shares to Uber BV with a face value of Rs 10 and premium of Rs 1578.20 each, to raise Rs 2,539 crore, according to data sourced from business intelligence platform Tofler. “We estimate that a large part of this allocation would go towards to (Uber) Eats business, therefore posing a direct challenge to other food delivery <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>such as Swiggy and Zomato,” said Durai of Paper.vc.</p>
      <p>Last month, Khosrowshahi was in Delhi to announce a partnership with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) under which the Uber app would get integrated with the city’s Metro and public bus service to provide commuters a seamless experience while travelling from one point to another.</p>
      <p>The company is planning to double the headcount of its Hyderabad and Bengaluru research and development (R&amp;D) centres to 1,000.</p>
      <p>It has already developed key products like Uber Lite for the India market, which is now being used globally.</p>
      <p>The mega capital infusion by Uber into its India arm comes at a time when rival Ola is coming up with a slew of new products and services.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm unveiled ‘Ola Drive’, a self-drive car-sharing service, with a plan to host a fleet of 20,000 cars by 2020. Ola plans to invest $200 million for the new platform initially and raise the investment to up to $500 million in the next couple of years. The company is also planning to launch a portfolio of in-house food brands and take them across the country.</p>
