      <h2>Study reveals schools across South West are suspending children for sexual abuse and attacks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:36:41+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Alice Cachia, Carl Eve</a></address>
      <p>A secondary pupil from a Plymouth school was permanently excluded because of sexual misconduct, an investigation has found.</p>
      <p>The research, carried out by Plymouth Live, has found the number of children suspended from school because of sexual misconduct is on the rise in Devon, Plymouth and Torbay.</p>
      <p>The investigation found there were 44 temporary suspensions for this reason in the academic year 2017/18. That was up from 32 the year before and is the highest number recorded since 2014/15.</p>
      <p>Devon and Plymouth saw 17 suspensions each, while there were 10 in Torbay.</p>
      <p>Official Department for Education guidelines say sexual misconduct includes abuse, assault, harassment, bullying, graffiti and lewd behaviour that is sexual in nature.</p>

      <p>Campaigners warned though that children's claims were "trivialised or dismissed as lies" too often.</p>
      <p>The figures show two of the 44 suspensions in 2017/18 were among primary pupils - both from Devon.</p>
      <p>The number of suspensions does not necessarily reflect the number of students, because a pupil could be suspended more than once in a year.</p>
      <p>In 2017/18, there were two secondary pupils - one in Devon and one in Plymouth - permanently excluded because of sexual misconduct.</p>
      <p>The data does not reveal whether the sexual misconduct was committed against other students or staff members.</p>
      <p>Iryna Pona, policy and research manager at The Children’s Society, said: "We know through our frontline work and our local well-being consultations with young people that inappropriate and harmful sexual behaviour among peers – both in school, outside school or online - is hugely traumatic for those affected.</p>

      <p>"Much more needs to be done to ensure school staff are alert to signs of inappropriate sexual behaviour and that schools provide a supportive environment for pupils to learn about healthy relationships and seek help if they are concerned about sexual bullying or abuse in school.</p>
      <p>"Too often we hear of children's claims being trivialised or dismissed as lies, and better training is needed to address shortcomings in the ability of school staff to recognise and respond to inappropriate sexual behaviour.</p>
      <p>"It's also vital that schools work with agencies like police and councils to assess the needs of and offer help to young people who display inappropriate or harmful sexual behaviour - which may be a sign that a child is or has been a victim of abuse or exploitation themselves, or has other underlying needs.</p>
      <p>"Both children who are subject to this behaviour and those children who are behind it should have access to a counsellor or therapy to help them recover or to address issues in their lives.</p>
      <p>"It is positive that healthy relationships will form part of mandatory Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in secondary schools, but it's vital staff receive the right training to ensure this curriculum is delivered appropriately across the country."</p>

      <p>Across England, there were 2,069 temporary suspensions because of sexual misconduct in 2017/18 - 200 of which were among primary-school aged pupils.</p>
      <p>There were also 100 students permanently excluded from schools that year, of which 12 were primary-school aged.</p>
      <p>Guidance issued by the DfE last year stated that: "Whilst any report of sexual violence or sexual harassment should be taken seriously, staff should be aware it is more likely that girls will be the victims of sexual violence and sexual harassment and more likely it will be perpetrated by boys."</p>
