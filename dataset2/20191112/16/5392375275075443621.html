      <p>Xiaomi Mi 10 Renderings Show Waterfall Screen Design and More<br/>4.1 (82.76%) 29 votes</p>
      <p>Just now, Techconfigurations exposed a set of renderings of the upcoming Xiaomi Mi 10 flagship smartphone. As the source claims, this handset is going to be a performance beast. The machine inherits the newly controversial 108MP camera. And of course, under the hood, it will carry the Snapdragon 865 mobile platform. As for the screen, it seems the waterfall screen of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro and the likes will become mainstream. At least, the author of the renderings thinks the Mi 10 will sport such a screen design. The back of the phone will use a glass material.</p>

      <p>At present, the only smartphones with a 108MP camera are considered to be the Xiaomi CC9 Pro and Mix Alpha. But if the former is already on shelves, the latter wonâ€™t be available earlier than December. So we think the forthcoming Xiaomi Mi 10 will continue this line.</p>

      <p>As you can see, the new Xiaomi Mi 10 will change the design style of the smartphone industry in 2020. Maybe it will get some inspiration from the Galaxy Note 10. The body is quite rounded; the back is covered with glass material; the front is equipped with a 6.5-inch/6.7-inch screen. No front camera opening is seen on the front. So there is every reason to think, the phone will be using a pop-up camera design.</p>

      <p>In terms of hardware, the Xiaomi MI 10 is rumored to come with the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the selling point of this handset will be the rear triple-camera with a 108MP sensor. The source claims it will support 3X zoom. This lens will be paired with two other sensors with 16MP and 20MP resolution. On the front, we can also see the screen fingerprint. There are various color options of blue, bright pink, red, and green.</p>
