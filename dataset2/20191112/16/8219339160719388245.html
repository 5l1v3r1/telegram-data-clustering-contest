      <h1>IBM: Mac users perform better at work and close larger high-value sales compared to PC users</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:05:36+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/bradleychambers/" target="_blank">Bradley Chambers</a></address>
      <p>Over the years, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/23/ibm-open-sources-macibm-code/">IBM</a> has been a big believer in letting its employees have a choice when it comes to technology. If you want to talk your supervisor into letting you use a Mac at work, you’ll want to see what they announced at the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/jamf-nation-user-conference/">Jamf Nation User Conference </a>(JNUC) about the productivity of Mac users compared to PC users.</p>
      <p>In 2015, IBM announced at <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/15/ibm-mac-support/">JNUC</a> that it was starting a <a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/">Mac@IBM program</a>. At the conference, they said that a single employee could support 5,400 IBM Mac users, where a single employee could only support 242 PC users. In 2016 and 2018, Fletcher Previn, CIO at IBM, showed that they <a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/debate-over-ibm-confirms-that-macs-are-535-less-expensive-than-pcs/">save</a> anywhere from $273-$543 per Mac compared to a PC over four years. He mentioned that it only takes 78 employees to support 277,000 Apple devices.</p>
      <p>Today, IBM <a href="https://www.jamf.com/resources/press-releases/ibm-announces-research-showing-mac-enables-greater-productivity-and-employee-satisfaction-at-ibm/">announced</a> some major news showing the benefits of using a Mac over a PC at work. According to IBM research, there are 22% more macOS users who exceed expectations in performance reviews compared to Windows users. High-value sales deals also tend to be 16% higher for Mac users compared to PC users.</p>
      <blockquote>“The state of IT is a daily reflection of what IBM thinks and feels about its employees,” said Fletcher Previn, CIO, IBM. “I’ve said it before — when did it become OK to live like the Jetsons at home but the Flintstones at work? We aim to create a productive environment for IBMers and continuously improve their work experience, and that’s why we introduced our employee-choice program to IBM employees in 2015.</blockquote>
      <p>IBM’s Mac users are 17% less likely to leave IBM compared to their Windows employees. Today, they have 200,000 macOS devices that are supported by only <i>seven</i> engineers. 200,000 Windows devices require 20 engineers.</p>

      <h3>9to5Mac’s Take</h3>
      <p>I am not surprised by these statistics whatsoever. macOS is easier to use for employees and easy to secure for IT. Apple has done a great job allowing companies like <a href="http://9to5mac.com/guides/jamf">Jamf</a> to simplify the management experience for <a href="http://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-at-work">enterprise IT departments</a>.</p>
      <p>If a company at IBM’s scale can make macOS not only <i>work</i>, but flourish (driving additional revenue), then all companies should be considering a program where employees can choose. Much of our software is now <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/24/web-apps-on-the-mac/">web-based</a>, so it’s made it easier for IT departments to allow macOS to run right alongside a PC.</p>
      <p>I know that I would strongly consider taking a smaller salary to be able to use a Mac over a PC. If I am going to be working on something for eight-plus hours a day, I want it to be a Mac.</p>
      <p>I have the third-party software I need to make me more productive on top of preferring the built-in macOS apps like Safari, Apple Mail, and Calendar. As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/07/macos-catalina-catalyst-apps/">Catalyst</a> brings even more great apps to the Mac, now is an excellent time for employers to consider letting their employees choose their hardware.</p>
