      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Dean Smith's side lost 2-1 to their West Midlands rivals on Sunday thanks to goals from Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez with Trezeguet netting for the visitors</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:47:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Orjan Nyland has been discussing his Aston Villa Premier League debut.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper was thrust into action in Sunday's 2-1 defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> , replacing Jed Steer who picked up a calf injury just seven minutes into his first start of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/orjan-nyland">Nyland</a> , who before Sunday had only played Under-23 football this season, took Steer's place on the substitute's bench with the former Norwich City man drafted in to replace injured first-choice 'keeper Tom Heaton.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian international had only played 23 times before for Villa, signed by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> in August last year.</p>

      <p>He missed most of last season through a ruptured Achilles injury.</p>
      <p>Although he <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/wolves-v-aston-villa-live-17231152">wasn't able to help his side avoid a third-straight League defeat</a> , Nyland will look to kick on and become a regular feature in Dean Smith's matchday squad going forward.</p>
      <p>“It was zero to 100 from my point of view," he told the club's website.</p>
      <p>"You never want to replace an injured teammate, but for me it was about doing the thing that I’ve been working for.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I know both sides of the game.</p>
      <p>"I know how it feels to be the number one and I know how it feels to prepare the other guy every day.</p>
      <p>“You just have to work every day and be ready.</p>
      <p>"I got my opportunity and I just had to try and grab it.”</p>

      <p>Villa boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a> lambasted his players for a poor first-half at Molineux in which his side found themselves 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>The second 45 minutes wasn't much better, with Villa slipping to 17th place and just three points clear of the relegation zone after 12 League matches.</p>
      <p>"We all agreed at half-time that we had to go out and be better, and we did play better in the second half," Nyland added.</p>
      <p>“That’s something we can take away for the next couple of games.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"But for the rest of the season, we need to start brightly and not give the opposition an advantage.</p>
      <p>“We dictated the second half, created chances and I felt like we could have had the equaliser, but unfortunately it was too late by the time we scored.”</p>
