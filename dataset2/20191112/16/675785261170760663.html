      <h1>Arsenal's Granit Xhaka 'house hunting in Milan' as January transfer rumours swirl</h1>
      <h2>The Swiss midfielder has not played for the Gunners since his altercation with fans as he was substituted in the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:54:50+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka is reported to be looking at houses in Milan as he prepares for a switch to Italy from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is out of favour in north London following his furious reaction to being booed by supporters in the draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , and he was stripped of his captain's armband after telling fans to "f*** off" while he was substituted.</p>
      <p>Although manager Unai Emery has not confirmed he is looking to sell the player, he did say he didn't know whether Xhaka would play for Arsenal again, and the fact Xhaka has not made an appearance since the incident suggests he is unlikely to feature again for the club.</p>

      <p>And according to Italian publication <a href="https://www.rsi.ch/sport/calcio/Xhaka-in-direzione-Milano-sponda-rossonera-12402312.html">RSI</a> he is already checking out possible properties in Milan ahead of a potential move to AC.</p>
      <p>AC Milan's Executive is Ivan Gazidis, who previously held the same role at Arsenal, and he is thought to be willing to offer Xhaka an escape route.</p>
      <p>Milan are struggling in Serie A this season, sitting in a lowly 14th place after 12 games, and Xhaka is likely to be offered first-team opportunities at the San Siro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/granit-xhaka-blasts-arsenal-fans-20852471">Speaking about the incident to Swiss outlet Blick Xhaka</a> said: "When my shirt number lit up on the fourth official's panel and our own fans broke into gleeful jubilation, that hit me very hard and really upset me.</p>

      <p>"It was very hurtful and frustrating. I can't understand a reaction like that even now, especially the vehemence of it and the extreme hostility directed against me.</p>
      <p>"At a time you are already experiencing a lot of hostility and your own football family insults you, it hurts a lot."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Xhaka returns to the Arsenal squad after the international break, with the Gunners hosting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on November 23.</p>
