      <p>Ladies of Dubai, the time is now to treat yourselves to a well-deserved day of pure relaxation at Caesars Bluewaters Dubai. Why? Because it has got the perfect ladies day out on offer.</p>
      <p>Until Saturday November 30, ladies can enjoy the perfect day out by pairing luxurious spa treatments at Qua Spa’s sanctuary of relaxation with a highly original Caesars Imperial Afternoon Tea. Sounds like a worthy day of bliss to us.</p>
      <p>Check out the choices below and find out how to treat yourself to a ladies’ day like no other. Go on, you deserve it.</p>
      <p><b>24 Carat Golden Glow Facial</b><br/>Gold isn’t just a beautiful material to ogle at, it has ancient healing properties to make your skin shine. Good thing then that Qua Spa has launched Dubai’s first of its kind ‘24 Carat Golden Glow Facial’. In partnership with British beauty pioneer Carol Joy LONDON, the golden facial treatment is designed to make ladies glow like Cleopatra, using the signature Ladies Collection Facial with Caviar Repair, Golden Glow and Collagen Lift. What’s more, for a limited time only until Saturday November 30, ladies who book this special facial will get a special 30 percent off a second treatment booked on the same day. What’s a little more indulgence in relaxation, after all?<br/><i>Dhs1,200 (90 min). Until Sat Nov 30. Daily 8am-10pm. Qua Spa, Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai (04 556 6401).</i></p>
      <p><b>Gift of Time</b><br/>Thinking of taking a special someone along for a couples' treatment? We all deserve a bit of time to ourselves, which makes the fittingly named Gift of Time full body massage at the Qua Spa the perfect treat. The 60-minute massage lets couples choose to enhance their experience with an additional invigorating body scrub or express beauty facial, meaning the choice of bliss is completely up to you. You’ll surely cherish these times.<br/><i>Dhs1,600 for two (90 min). Until Sat Nov 30. Daily 8am-10pm. Qua Spa, Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai (04 556 6401).</i></p>
      <p><b>Caesars Imperial Afternoon Tea</b><br/>After giving yourself some time to relax, it’s time to take in the scenery with a spot of tea. But Caesars doesn’t offer your regular afternoon tea, as its Caesars Imperial Afternoon Tea is specially inspired by the Roman Empire, so expect a royal time. True to its word, ladies can expect to pick from a selection of sweet and savoury bites from the furthest reaches of Central Europe to exotic flavours of the Mediterranean, and sip on exquisite tea, of course. Even better, there isn’t just one place to take on the culinary journey, as the Caesars Imperial Afternoon Tea can be had at Roman Lounge or The Piazza with spectacular views of the Arabian Gulf. Take your pick and prepare for a (royal) ball of a time.<br/><i>Dhs185 per person. Daily 2pm-6pm. Available at The Piazza, Caesars Resort Bluewaters Dubai; Roman Lounge, Caesars Palace Bluewaters Dubai (04 556 6466).</i></p>
