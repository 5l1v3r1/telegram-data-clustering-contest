      <h1>AMD Ryzen 9 APUs could present a new challenge for Intel</h1>
      <h2>AMD wants to keep its momentum rolling</h2>

      <h4>Forward-looking: AMD has been doing everything right and is looking to parlay its recent victories into sustained success for the long haul. According to hardware leaker @Komachi, the chipmaker could do just that through the use of integrated graphics.</h4>
      <p>As TechRadar <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-may-pack-gpu-units-into-ryzen-9-to-keep-intel-on-edge">highlights</a>, a list of processors recently published by the hardware leaker highlights four Ryzen 9 parts – two 45W units and two 15W “Pro” models – sporting a B12 designation. This, according to the leaker, indicates the presence of 12 graphical compute units.</p>

      <p>Ryzen 9 APUs, as the publication points out, could benefit from heightened clock speeds and increased efficiency afforded by their 7-nanometer design. This, in turn, would presumably benefit graphics compute units as well. It’d be an interesting alternative to discrete graphics solutions and would of course further press Intel in the portable laptop space.</p>
      <p>AMD has had a phenomenal 2019, recently reporting its <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82578-amd-reports-highest-quarterly-revenue-since-2005.html">highest quarterly revenue since 2015</a>. The company still has a lot of ground to make up but has been steering the ship in the right direction with <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82674-amd-continues-erode-intel-cpu-market-share.html">increased market share</a> ever since Q2 2017.</p>
      <p>As always, it’s worth reiterating that the post from @Komachi neither confirms nor denies anything as nothing is truly official until official word comes from the horse’s mouth. With CES 2020 less than two months away, however, the timing is certainly right for a hardware announcement.</p>
