      <p>A 17-year-old boy skilled in computer technology allegedly raped one girl and shared sexual photos he incited others to take after befriending them online, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>He is also accused of blackmail and harassment in a case involving five suspected victims - including a 13-year-old girl with learning difficulties.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed the defendant, who is from Co Antrim but cannot be identified, poses a danger to vulnerable members of the public.</p>
      <p>A judge heard he allegedly boasted to police about his computer abilities, saying that he deliberately sought out and crashed strangers' internet games.</p>
      <p>The teenager is charged with 21 offences, including rape, causing a child to engage in sexual activity, trying to blackmail one alleged victim into paying Â£500, and multiple counts of possessing, distributing and inciting girls to take indecent photographs.</p>
      <p>He faces further counts of unauthorised access to computer material by performing a function with intent to secure access to a programme or data.</p>
      <p>The alleged offences were committed against teenage girls on dates between August and November 2018.</p>
      <p>Conor Maguire, prosecuting, told a bail hearing the defendant denied raping one of the complainants, claiming they had previously had "an affair".</p>
      <p>Mr Maguire contended that the accused's behaviour has escalated, describing the alleged victims as vulnerable due to their age or home circumstances.</p>
      <p>"One of the injured parties is a 13-year-old with learning difficulties," he said.</p>
      <p>Amid opposition to bail, it was claimed that the defendant's mother threw his phone into a river, resulting in the loss of critical evidence.</p>
      <p>Another mobile seized as part of the investigation was said to contain non-sexual images of unknown babies.</p>
      <p>"Given the applicant's particular skills in using computer technology, he would be able to evade police digitally and engage inappropriately with young females," Mr Maguire argued.</p>
      <p>He alleged the accused was having difficulty managing his anger and self-control, expressed hostility to females, and "extreme levels of manipulation and control in both direct contact and online relationships".</p>
      <p>The barrister added: "It's the police view this applicant is a danger to the public, and especially vulnerable members of the public."</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Thomas McKeever argued that his client has spent almost a year in custody, with his mother shocked at the allegations against him.</p>
      <p>"Her firm instructions are that she will do everything necessary to ensure safeguards are put in place," he said.</p>
      <p>According to Mr McKeever a proposed bail address is up to 30 miles away from where complainants live.</p>
      <p>Adjourning the application, Mr Justice Colton said he wanted to see a report and more information on supervision arrangements.</p>
      <p>The judge pointed out: "It's a troubling case."</p>
