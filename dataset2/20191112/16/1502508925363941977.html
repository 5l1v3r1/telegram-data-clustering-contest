      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">Cyclone </a>Bulbul that battered the coastal districts of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/west-bengal">West Bengal </a>before hurtling towards Bangladesh has caused a loss which could be between Rs 15,000 crore and Rs 19,000 crore in the state, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>made the landfall between <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/west-bengal">West Bengal </a>and Bangladesh coasts on the midnight of Saturday and claimed 14 lives.</p>
      <p>"An interim estimation has been prepared from the preliminary report submitted by different departments after surveying the cyclone-hit areas. The final estimation will be reached only after departments submit their reports," the IAS officer said.</p>
      <p>According to initial estimates, the losses could reach Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 19,000 crore, he said.</p>
      <p>Complete reports on damages in the districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore are yet to reach the secretariat.</p>
      <p>Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha has sought the reports on Tuesday, official sources said.</p>
      <p>At least 14 departments including irrigation, forest, agriculture, power, public health and engineering and panchayat were asked to submit their report on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>After the final report is prepared, it would be sent to the Centre, he said.</p>
      <p>A central government team is scheduled to reach the cyclone-affected areas of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/west-bengal">West Bengal </a>later this week and prepare a report on the devastation.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday conducted an aerial survey of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>Bulbul-ravaged areas of South 24 Parganas district and had announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the families of each of those killed in the storm.</p>
