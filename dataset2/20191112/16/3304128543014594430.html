      <p>Barchok, a former lecturer at Egerton University, who also served as Bomet DG, was sworn in on August 8 as the third governor of Bomet following the death of governor Joyce Laboso.</p>
      <p>Laboso succumbed to cancer at the Nairobi Hospital on July 29.</p>

        <b>Calls for a female Deputy Governor </b>
      </p>
      <p>In the appointment, Governor Barchok has ignored calls from the political class to appoint a female DG.</p>

      <p>Women leaders, including Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru and her Kitui counterpart Charity Ngilu, had appealed to Barchok to nominate a female DG in honour of the late Governor. The two were close friends of Laboso.</p>
      <p>During Laboso’s burial, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga also echoed the two governors’ request saying it “should be automatic” that the governor should appoint a female DG.</p>
      <p>“I thought that is taken for granted. That is not an issue really. Because a woman was a governor and a man was her deputy, now when the woman governor has left the position, it is automatic that a woman would become a deputy governor. I don’t think that should be an issue, ” said Raila.</p>
      <p>Other leaders were rooting for Laboso’s relatives for the position but the Tuesday appointment clearly came as a shocker.</p>
