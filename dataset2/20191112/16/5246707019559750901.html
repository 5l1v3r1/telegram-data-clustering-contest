      <p>If you're not yet feeling the hype for the upcoming <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield"><b>Pokémon Sword and Shield</b></a> games, you might want to give this fancy new commercial a spin.</p>
      <p>Appropriately called 'Pokémon Sword &amp; Pokémon Shield – Epic battles await', this new trailer certainly brings the heat. With <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/soapbox_attacking_pokemon_creator_game_freak_isnt_cool_but_biting_back_isnt_the_answer">the current state of the Pokémon community</a>, we're sure there'll be <i>some</i> fans who will watch this and say, "meh, looks rubbish anyway" without giving it a second thought, but if you're a little more open-minded, you'll hopefully enjoy it. Seeing the opening with that giant Corvinight would've blown our tiny minds as kids.</p>
      <p>As well as the fancy CGI, the video showcases the all-new Dynamax and Gigantamax phenomena set to appear in the upcoming games - a feature which we'll make sure to explore when our full review of the games drops in the near future.</p>
      <p>If you missed it, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/two_new_pokemon_revealed_in_sword_and_shields_final_trailer">two brand new Pokémon were shown off</a> in a trailer yesterday. Interestingly, The Pokémon Company hasn't revealed the names of these new monsters in an official capacity.</p>
