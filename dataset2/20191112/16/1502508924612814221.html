      <p>NCP and Congress on Tuesday indicated that they were not in a hurry to form a non-BJP government in Maharashtra in the wake of the imposition of President's Rule and said they will sort out all issues among themselves and their allies before talking to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena.</a></p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who addressed a joint press conference with Congress leader Ahmed Patel and others, said that the imposition of President's Rule has given the two parties enough time to discuss and decide.</p>
      <p>"We are in no hurry as the Governor has given us enough time to discuss and decide," said Pawar.</p>
      <p>The joint press conference was held hours after the President's Rule was imposed in the state.</p>
      <p>Senior leaders of Congress and NCP on Tuesday held discussions about government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Ahmed Patel said the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>made a formal contact with the party for the first time on Monday and "it is necessary that there should be clarity on some issues."</p>
      <p>"Only after that, some decision can be taken. First, we will talk. Let there be clarification and after that, we will talk to Shiv Sena," he said.</p>
      <p>He slammed the imposition of President's rule in the state.</p>
      <p>Patel also talked about clarity on the common minimum programme (CMP). "The day there is a decision and there is clarity, we will talk to Shiv Sena," he said.</p>
      <p>Pawar said there had been no discussion between them on the CMP.</p>
      <p>Congress and NCP had fought the assembly polls together. BJP had emerged as the single-largest party with 105 seats and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>had finished second with 56 seats.</p>
      <p>NCP leaders have said that a non-BJP government cannot be formed in the state without NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena joining hands.</p>
