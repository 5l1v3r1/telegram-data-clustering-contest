      <p>Former Maharashtra Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>on Tuesday said that the imposition of President's Rule in the state was unfortunate but expressed hope that a stable government would soon be formed.</p>
      <p>"People had given a very clear mandate. Even then a government could not be formed. It is very unfortunate that the state was forced to have the President's Rule. Still, I expect that a stable government will soon be formed in the state," read Fadnavis' press note on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, BJP MP and former Chief Minister Narayan Rane too had said that Fadnavis was making efforts to form a BJP led coalition government in the state.</p>
      <p>"BJP will try to form the government. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>is putting in all efforts in this regard. I am now with the BJP. I will do everything I can to ensure the BJP comes to power again," said Rane.</p>
      <p>Rane was speaking to reporters after the BJP's Core Committee meeting held at Varsha Bungalow, the official residence of the Chief Minister of the state.</p>
      <p>Rane said that a government should be formed at the earliest in the state to end the woes of farmers and also targeted the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>for the delay behind the formation of the government.</p>
      <p>"It is bad that there is a delay in government formation. If you are concerned about farmers and the people of Maharashtra, you should form a government. On one hand, you say a government should be formed at the earliest, on the other, you are behaving like this. It is really sad," said Rane.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra came under the President's Rule today after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his approval for the requisite notification.</p>
      <p>The President signed the notification following the recommendation of the Union Cabinet which acted on the report from the state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.</p>
      <p>The Governor had recommended the imposition of President's Rule following the political stalemate in the state over the formation of the government with BJP, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>and NCP being unable to gather support for forming government in the state.</p>
