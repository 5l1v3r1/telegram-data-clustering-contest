      <p>PUNE: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dhanush-Srikanth">Dhanush Srikanth</a> couldn't have asked for a better international debut. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Telangana">Telangana</a> boy clinched three gold medals at the ongoing <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian-shooting-championships">Asian shooting championships</a> in Doha on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>With the medals, Dhanush, 16, became India's first shooter with hearing impairment to win medals at an open international meet. Dhanush secured top place in junior men's 10m air rifle individual, mixed-gender and team events.</p>

      <p>The teen shooter dominated the individual final as he won gold with a margin of 2.5 points over China's Xuanle Jiang. Dhanush scored 248.2 in the final, while the Chinese 245.7. Bronze went to Dhanush's teammate <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shahu-Tushar-Mane">Shahu Tushar Mane</a> with a score of 226.4.</p>
      <p>Although Dhanush's gold came with a comfortable margin, he shot his last shot under pressure after getting a yellow card before the final shot.</p>
      <p>Since this was Dhanush's first international meet, he was nervous and was loading the pellets in his rifle before the command issued by the range official. As a result, the chief jury had to give him a warning (yellow card) and another mistake would have cost him 2 points from his scores. But the youngster remained calm and shot a 10.6 in his final shot to take the gold.</p>
      <p>Dhanush, Shahu Mane and Hriday Hazarika won the team gold with a combined score of 1877.1. In the mixed-gender final, Dhanush paired with his academy-mate and teammate Shreya Agarwal to beat Chinese pair of Jiang and Zeru Wang 16-14.</p>

      <p>"He was a little nervous since it was his first international event. He was under pressure when people started clapping, but we asked him to expect such distractions and obeyed and shot really well," Dhanush's coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Neha-Chavan">Neha Chavan</a> told TOI.</p>
