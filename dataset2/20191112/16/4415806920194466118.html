      <p>Hughes hailed his “brave” partner for battling through her ordeal, and said she didn’t deserve any of the treatment she received.</p>
      <p>Speaking on This Morning, he became tearful as he talked about Nelson, and was comforted by presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield.</p>
      <p>Hughes said: “She rang me, bless her, about 10 minutes after the documentary aired and she was just so overwhelmed and she just broke down on the phone to me.</p>
      <p>“She’s a strong girl now, she’s extremely strong.”</p>

      <p>He clasped his hands to his face saying “I can’t” as Willoughby comforted him, before adding: “I don’t know why, but I get so emotional when I’m speaking about it.</p>
      <p>“I’m fine talking about myself, but I get emotional when I talk about other people.</p>
      <p>“She’s so brave and so strong, she didn’t deserve any of that. She’s fantastic.”</p>
      <p>Nelson’s documentary about the effects of online bullying broke a viewing record for BBC Three, the broadcaster revealed in September.</p>
      <p>The show, Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out, focused on the Little Mix star’s struggles with being bullied since rising to fame eight years ago.</p>
