      <p>After a lengthy pre-launch period, the new <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/beey9">Disney+ streaming service</a> is now available.</p>
      <p>Disney+ costs $6.99 per month and is available as a direct-to-consumer service. There's no need to have a TV package to gain access to Disney+.</p>
      <p>As part of the launch, Disney has made a wealth of content available, including various Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar titles.</p>

      <h3>Disney+ is finally here</h3>
      <p>In case you've been living under a rock recently, Disney has spent the last few months <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/04/disney-plus-pricing-launch-date.html">preparing to launch</a> a new streaming service.</p>
      <p>That day has now finally come. The all-new Disney streaming service is now finally here.</p>
      <p>The service costs $6.99 per month which is considerably cheap considering the amount of content on offer. There's also the option to subscribe annually for $69.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, Disney has also now bundled Disney+ with both Hulu and ESPN+. Therefore, consumers can now subscribe to all three streaming services through one subscription.</p>
      <p>The bundle subscription is currently priced at $12.99 per month and this represents a 25-percent saving compared to subscribing to all three services, separately.</p>
      <p>There's also a one-week free trial available so you are able to try before you buy.</p>

      <h3>Disney has backed up the launch with a lot of content</h3>
      <p>While many people will understandably associate Disney with the classics, that's really only scratching the surface here. Disney has a lot of content at its disposal and it is making a vast amount of it available to stream.</p>
      <p>Yes, there's a large selection of Disney animated classics, as well as a very broad selection of Disney live action content as well. However, Disney also owns some of the most popular franchises, including Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and National Geographic.</p>
      <p>Naturally, content from those franchises are also now available to stream via Disney+.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>This includes much of the main Star Wars and Marvel movies, including the latest ones.</p>
      <p>Disney is also promising to release even more content over the next few months, including a number of Disney+ originals.</p>
      <h3>Getting started with Disney+</h3>
      <p>There's nothing too complicated when it comes to getting started with Disney+. For example, you can head over to <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/beey9">the new website</a> right now and sign up there.</p>
