      <h1>Jewellery store ring display has people in stitches as it looks rather x-rated</h1>
      <h2>Typically engagement rings are associated with romance and elegance, but one jewellery store has left people red-faced after one of it's ring displays ended up looking rather rude</h2>

      <p>These days people on the internet love to spend time shaming just about anything.</p>
      <p>Most common are perhaps wedding shaming and ring shaming, but in an interesting twist, members of a ring shaming group on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> have been mocking something other than a piece of jewellery.</p>
      <p>In a post on the group, That's It, I'm Ring Shaming, someone shared an image of a diamond <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/engagement-ring">engagement ring</a> and wedding band on a grey stand that looked rather x-rated, reports <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10320307/jewellery-shop-engagement-ring-display-willy/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>They said: "I don't like the ring, but I hate the presentation."</p>

      <p>People were quick to suggest that the ring holder resembled a "penis".</p>
      <p>One person joked: "It's a grower, not a shower."</p>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "I've heard of a c*** ring but..."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A third person added: "Is that ring happy to see me or is it just my imagination?"</p>
      <p>A different user quipped: "Takes 'if you like it then you should have put a ring on it' to a new level!"</p>
      <p>"It's trying it's best," replied another.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And in other weird news, a man recently hit the headlines for turning his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/man-saves-nail-clippings-year-20716234">nail clippings into an engagement ring.</a></p>
      <p>Yes, really.</p>
      <p>The man, who creates videos on YouTube under the name  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKi85QNr7zo">Kiwami Japan,</a> saved his nail clippings for an entire year to create the one-of-a-kind piece of jewellery.</p>
      <p>The whole process was shared on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  in a disturbing  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/viral">viral</a>  video by  <a href="https://twitter.com/SCMPNews/status/1186785554446176256">SCMP News.</a></p>
      <p>Once he had collected a sufficient amount of clippings, the man started by putting them into a blender.</p>
      <p>However, this didn't give the desired consistency, so he then ground them into a very fine powder, before mixing with water in a pan.</p>
      <p>The fourth step saw him compress the nail powder and water mixture and put it into an oven for 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>What came out of the oven can only be described as looking like a lump of dark clay.</p>
      <p>The man took the mixture and put it into a diamond-shaped mould before inserting it into a silver ring - which he also made himself.</p>
      <p>When all was done, the finished product was a ring with a dull black stone, which thankfully looked nothing like fingernails.</p>
