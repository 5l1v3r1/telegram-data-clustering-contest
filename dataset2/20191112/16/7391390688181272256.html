      <p>When the term gold digger is thrown around it’s usually in reference to an older wealthy man dating a younger woman. As a term it feels sexist and outdated. However, a new BBC One domestic noir is about to flip those stereotypes on their head. <i>Gold Digger</i> tells the story of the consequences of a woman bringing a younger male love interest into her already crumbling family and the consequence that come with that. But <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-was-bbc-ones-gold-digger-filmed-19343306">who is Julia Ormond?</a> The actress taking centre stage in the new BBC drama has played her fair share of roles in crime thrillers and is no stranger to the big screen.</p>
      <p>Having starred opposite the likes of <a href="http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/52898/">Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt</a>, Julia Ormond has been a British Hollywood A lister since the nineties. <a href="https://www.cssd.ac.uk/content/webber-douglas-academy-alumni">Graduating from the esteemed Webber-Douglas Academy</a> of Dramatic Art it’s seem Ormond has always had her sights set on the arts. With a career spanning back to 1989 she’s played varying characters.</p>
      <p>Superfans of <i>Mad Men </i>will also recognise Ormond as Don Draper's mother Marie Calvet<i>.</i> Marie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/characters/nm0000566?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t83">appeared in five episodes</a> of the huge U.S. series, always sporting an impeccable '60s up-do.</p>
      <p>Ormond's other notable TV roles include Paula Gyson in <i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent </i>and Elizabeth Krauss in <i>Incorporated.</i></p>

      <p>While she’s been a staple on TV screens Ormond is perhaps most recognisable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/25/julia-ormond-interview">for her work in film.</a> In the nineties she starred in <i>The Baby of Mâcon, Legends of the Fall,</i> and<i> Sabrina</i>, which all achieved huge critical acclaim. Speaking about her work to the <i>Guardian</i> she said, "The year I was filming <i>Sabrina</i> I had five films out, so you're doing publicity and press times five! And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/25/julia-ormond-interview">it can be completely overwhelming.</a> One of my first ever interviews was for the cover of the <i>New York Times Magazine. </i>You have to build experience to deserve that. I can cope when I'm out of my comfort zone, but I have a very sharp feel for when I'm really far, far out from what's sane."</p>
      <p>In<i> Gold Digger</i>, Ormond plays Julia Day, a divorcee who meets an enigmatic younger man with less than pure intentions. Speaking about <i>Gold Digger </i>in a statement she said:</p>
      <blockquote>“What attracted me to the story is the way that it's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/golddigger/julia">provocative and it challenges</a> us in terms of how we see women who have devoted their life to motherhood and what they do when that phase is coming to an end. To Julia’s children there is a sense that Benjamin is a threat to their inheritance and a feeling that there is something off about him, but it’s founded in this disbelief that he could genuinely love her.”</blockquote>
      <p>If you’re a fan of the dark and mysterious <i>Gold Digger</i> promises to keep you on the edge of your seat. You can catch episode one on BBC One at 9 p.m. on Nov. 12.</p>
