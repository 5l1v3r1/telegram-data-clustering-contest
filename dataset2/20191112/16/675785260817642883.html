      <h1>Gemma Collins sprints through scorching desert amid rumours she's back with Arg</h1>
      <h2>The GC penned a message about the 'magical' desert as she ran across the dunes with not a care in the world</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:46:59+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Diva Forever <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma Collins</a> shared a snap with her 1.5 million followers that she hopes will inspire them to get out and travel more.</p>
      <p>The GC can be seen sprinting across the Dubai desert - where she's holidaying with her on/off beau James Argent.</p>
      <p>Gemma, 36, is waving her arms about as she abandons all her cares in the world.</p>
      <p>She wrote to fans: "Travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you RICHER.......The desert was very magical.......I hope you all get to experience this in your life."</p>
      <p>Fans have been scratching their heads about whether Gemma and Arg are back on considering they're there together, but there's been no confirmation of a rekindled romance as of yet.</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://swns.com/">SWNS</a> that they are, and that things are going pretty well between them.</p>
      <p>The source said: "They're definitely together, and there doesn't seem to be any tension between them.</p>
      <p>"Gemma was on her own with friends for five days and then her friends left when Arg arrived yesterday. They've mostly stayed on the sun loungers by the pool, and have been getting really touchy, holding hands and stroking each other.</p>
      <p>"They seem really relaxed together and getting on well, they're always smiling at each other and laughing, there's been no rows."</p>
      <p>The holiday comes after Gemma called paramedics to Arg's mansion amid fears he had overdosed.</p>

      <p>Their getaway's also seen them racing about the desert on quad bikes, with the GC admitting that she'd love to audition to be a Bond girl.</p>
      <p>Arg seems to be getting in touch with his spiritual side recently, sharing a meme that read: "I need Jesus."</p>
      <p>He also quoted rapper <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> , who's famously outspoken about his Christian beliefs: "I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long."</p>
      <p>Gemma's also reportedly got big ambitions for them as a couple - wanting to be the UK's answer to Kanye and wife <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> .</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/">Closer</a> : "Gemma enjoys being a star, but she really loves the idea of being a power couple - with Arg 'doing a Kanye' and finding God, she's said this could be their big break and they could finally make it as the UK's answer to Kim and Kanye."</p>
