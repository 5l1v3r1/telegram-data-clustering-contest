      <h1>Cuomo Threatens National Grid: Provide Gas or Lose Your License</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:43:35+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gold</a></address>
      <p>Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and a utility that provides gas to New York City and Long Island have been locked in a standoff since May, when New York regulators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/nyregion/williams-pipeline-gas-energy.html?module=inline">blocked the construction of a $1 billion natural gas pipeline</a> that would have run from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York.</p>
      <p>The utility, National Grid, says the pipeline is crucial to meeting the rising energy demand in the region and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/reuters-america-national-grid-says-no-new-nyc-natgas-customers-without-williams-pipeline.html">has imposed a moratorium</a>, refusing to activate gas hookups for both new and returning customers.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the fight took a sharp turn after Mr. Cuomo threatened to revoke National Grid’s license to operate in the southern part of New York.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cuomo, in <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NationalGrid_Letter.pdf">a letter</a>, accused the utility of “mishandling” its gas supply system and recklessly disregarding its obligations as a public utility when it issued the moratorium.</p>
      <p>The utility’s fundamental legal obligation “was to plan and provide for future needs,” the governor wrote. “You failed by your own admission.”</p>
      <p>National Grid, which supplies gas to 1.8 million customers in New York City and on Long Island, said it would review Mr. Cuomo’s letter and respond accordingly.</p>
      <p>“We continue to work with all parties on these critical natural gas supply issues on behalf of all our customers in downstate New York,” the utility said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cuomo’s letter, sent to two National Grid executives, essentially boiled down to an ultimatum: either the utility would supply gas to all those requesting it, or the governor would seek to revoke its license in two weeks.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to allow New Yorkers to be extorted,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on NY1 on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>“They’re not the only utility in the world, and a lot of companies would like to have this franchise,” he added.</p>
      <p>It was unclear what steps, if any, the Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates utilities, would take in response to Mr. Cuomo’s letter. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Environmental groups have opposed the pipeline, arguing that it would destroy fragile ecosystems and undermine efforts to reduce New York’s dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-psc-action-ordering-national-grid-immediately-connect-over-1100">Mr. Cuomo ordered National Grid to restore gas</a> to customers who had either moved to a new home or had temporarily turned off their service. He also said the utility could face millions of dollars in penalties and ordered an investigation.</p>
      <p>In his letter, Mr. Cuomo said National Grid had “improperly denied service to over 1,100 households.”</p>
      <p>He also criticized the utility, saying it linked its future to the pipeline, which he called “risky at best,” and failed to explore other short-term or long-term options to provide gas from other sources.</p>
      <p>“The choice was never between the pipeline or an immediate moratorium,” he wrote. “There were, and are, certainly other short-term solutions.”</p>
      <p>National Grid also operates in upstate New York, where it provides both gas and electric service. Mr. Cuomo’s letter did not address the utility’s services there.</p>
      <p>National Grid is not the only utility in New York to impose a moratorium in the New York City region. In March, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/nyregion/con-ed-natural-gas.html?module=inline">Con Edison stopped new gas hookups</a> in a large swath of Westchester County, saying its existing pipelines could not meet rising demand.</p>
      <p>In April, Con Edison said it had <a href="https://www.coned.com/en/save-money/convert-to-natural-gas/westchester-natural-gas-moratorium/natural-gas-capacity-expansion">reached an agreement</a> with a pipeline operator that would provide it with a fresh supply of natural gas. But the company said that under the deal, it would not get additional gas capacity until November 2023.</p>
