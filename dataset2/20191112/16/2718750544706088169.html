      <h1>Werner Herzog to Jon Favreau: Sorry to This Man</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:35:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Alter</a></address>
      <p>Here is a quote from director Werner Herzog on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xQyQnXrLb0">the jungle</a> of South America:</p>
      <blockquote>Of course, there’s a lot of misery. But it is the same misery that is all around us. The trees here are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don’t think they — they sing. They just screech in pain. It’s an unfinished country. It’s still prehistorical. The only thing that is lacking is — is the dinosaurs here. It’s like a curse weighing on an entire landscape. And whoever … goes too deep into this has his share of this curse. So we are cursed with what we are doing here. It’s a land that God, if he exists, has — has created in anger. It’s the only land where — where creation is unfinished yet. Taking a close look at — at what’s around us there — there is some sort of a harmony. It is the harmony of … overwhelming and collective murder. And we in comparison to the articulate vileness and baseness and obscenity of all this jungle. </blockquote>
      <p>And here is a quote from director Werner Herzog on <i>The Jungle Book </i>director Jon Favreau:</p>
      <blockquote>I do not know what other films he has made. <br/><b>You don’t?</b>﻿<br/>No. </blockquote>
      <p>If you had told us five years ago that Werner Herzog would play a role in a Jon Favreau–directed <i>Star Wars </i>series,<i> </i>well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNGzMK5e4c">we’d eat our shoe</a>. But it’s true, Herzog plays a “mysterious figure” in <i>The Mandalorian</i>,<i> </i>which premieres today on Disney+. His character is credited only as “the Client,” and he sets the plot into action by hiring the Mandalorian himself to bounty-hunt. In an <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/werner-herzog-the-mandalorian-star-wars-jon-favreau-disney-plus-1203400810/">interview with <i>Variety</i></a>,<i> </i>Herzog explained that it doesn’t actually matter that he hasn’t seen <i>Star Wars</i>,<i> </i>saying: “You shouldn’t feel upset that I haven’t seen the ‘Star Wars’ films; I hardly see any films. I read. I see two, three, maybe four films per year.”</p>
      <p>Among those rarefied few films was the original, animated <i>Lion King</i>,<i> </i>which Herzog calls “wonderful.” That being said, he had no idea that Favreau directed a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/disneys-lion-king-beats-harry-potter-july-box-office-record.html">box-office behemoth</a> <i>Lion King </i>adaptation this year, one with uncanny valley, dead-eyed talking animals that make a case for Herzog’s horrors of nature.</p>
      <p>So what <i>does </i>Herzog watch when he’s not ignoring the existence of Favreau’s movies? WrestleMania and the Criterion Channel, mostly, but he’s also been into the Kardashians, truly making him the <i>Grizzly Man </i>of television: “As vulgar as they may be, it doesn’t matter that much, but you have to find some sort of orientation. As I always say, the poet must not close his eyes, must not avert them.”</p>
