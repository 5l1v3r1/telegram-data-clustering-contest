      <p>Chancellor Sajid Javid has been accused of "running scared" after a Channel 4 election debte about the economy was scapped.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> claim that Mr Javid refused to take part in the debate, which was set to happen at the weekend, despite shadow chancellor John McDonnell agreeing to go head-to-head with him.</p>
      <p>Channel 4 said plans for the debate are "currently on hold" as it was "not possible to reach an agreement with all parties".</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell said: "<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp">Sajid Javid</a> is running scared of debating with me and completely understandably, as the Tories are inventing silly figures which Labour would pull apart in a public debate.</p>
      <p>"Clearly the Tories can't even cost their own programme.</p>

      <p>"Let me make it completely clear that the figures published by the Tories about Labour's spending plans are fake news, and I reiterate that income tax rates under Labour won't rise for 95% of people, and that only the top 5% would pay more.</p>
      <p>"There will also be no VAT increases under Labour."</p>
      <p>A Channel 4 spokesman said: "Plans for a chancellors/economy debate are currently on hold as it was not possible to reach an agreement with all parties.</p>
      <p>"If the situation does change, we would certainly explore options on how best to proceed.</p>
      <p>"We will be announcing our election plans in due course."</p>
      <p>Labour said the party has been informed that the proposed 90-minute set piece on Sunday November 17 has been shelved.</p>
      <p>Mr Javid told Channel 4 News on Monday evening: "I understand that there's discussions going on.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to pre-empt those, but it's always good to have a robust discussion, and I'm happy to discuss with John McDonnell any time."</p>
