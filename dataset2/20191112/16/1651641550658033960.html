      <p>California state in the US has enacted a privacy law which goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2020. This new law is known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and it gives consumers more control over their data. Microsoft yesterday announced that it will extend CCPA throughout the US allowing people to control their data. With CCPA, Microsoft must be transparent about data collection and use, and also offer people with the option to prevent their personal information from being sold. Microsoft is also working with its enterprise customers to help them comply with CCPA.</p>
      <blockquote>We are optimistic that Congress will take the initiative to act. In the meantime, we will continue to work with states that recognize the urgency to implement stronger laws to protect everyone’s privacy. As with GDPR and CCPA, whenever and wherever strong, sensible privacy laws are enacted, we will work to quickly extend the core protections those laws offer to our customers everywhere.</blockquote>
