      <p>IBM has published its latest study focusing on the benefits of Apple products in enterprise, and has found that a fleet of over 200,000 Macs leads to far lower support costs, smaller numbers of support staff, and happier employees versus a Windows deployment.</p>

      <p>In the study presented on Tuesday, IBM says that employees that used Mac machines were 22 percent more likely to exceed expectations in performance reviews compared to Windows users. Mac-using employees generating sales deals have 16% larger proceeds as well.<br/><br/>"The state of IT is a daily reflection of what IBM thinks and feels about its employees," said Fletcher Previn, CIO, IBM. "I've said it before - when did it become OK to live like the Jetsons at home but the Flintstones at work? We aim to create a productive environment for IBMers and continuously improve their work experience, and that's why we introduced our employee-choice program to IBM employees in 2015." <br/><br/>Turning to employee satisfaction, the first-of-its-kind study shows that Mac users were 17 percent less likely to leave IBM compared to their Windows counterparts. Mac users also were happier with the software available, with 5 percent asking for additional software compared to 11 percent of Windows users.</p>

      <p>Previn touched on the cost to support the Macs in the workplace. A team of seven engineers is needed to maintain 200,000 Macs whereas a team of 20 is needed for that number of Windows PCs.<br/><br/>During setup, the migration process was simple for 98 percent of Mac users versus only 86 percent of those moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Windows users were also five times as likely to need on-site support.<br/><br/>Earlier this year <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/06/20/survey-finds-reliability-is-the-reason-workers-choose-mac">Jamf released</a> a study that showed reliability was the number one reason users preferred to work on a Mac rather than a PC.<br/><br/>IBM has made a number of announcements at JNUC in the past. <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/24/ibm-seeing-great-returns-on-over-277000-macs-and-ios-devices-issued-to-employees">Last year at JNUC 2018</a>, Previn announced the computing behemoth was open-sourcing its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/23/ibm-open-sources-macibm-code-spreading-tech-to-other-businesses">Mac@IBM</a> provisioning code as well as the huge returns it saw with its Mac deployment.<br/><br/>The Mac@IBM program <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/28/ibm-gives-workers-choice-between-macs-or-pcs-plans-to-deploy-50000-apple-macbooks">kicked off in 2015</a> where IBM was deploying 1,900 Mac devices per week supported by only 24 help desk staff members.</p>
