      <h1>JBL Everest 110GA Bluetooth earbuds with Google Assistant down to $26 (from $70)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:52:13+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/mark-koegel/" target="_blank">Mark Koegel</a></address>
      <p>It may not bet Black Friday just yet, but this deal on the JBL Everest 110GA headphones is certainly a Black Friday price. At $44 off on <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;pub=5574915657&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5336677250&amp;customid=&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FJBL-EVEREST-110GA-Bluetooth-In-Ear-Headphones-with-Google-Assistant%2F153278921090%3Fvar%3D453157225416">JBL's eBay store</a>, these headphones may be worth buying early â€” they are currently selling on JBL's website for $70.</p>

      <p>The JBL Everest 110GA headphones are Google Assistant compatible, allowing you to activate the assistant to place calls or read messages with the touch of a button. The echo canceling microphone means your phone calls will always be crystal clear, and with three sizes of ear-tips, you're sure to find a comfortable fit. Its battery can last up to 8 hours, but you'll need to recharge it with a Micro USB cord as these have no USB-C port.</p>
      <p>The headphones come in Blue, Silver, and Gun Metal. The eBay listing is direct from Harman with authenticity guaranteed.</p>
      <p>As of publishing, Gun Metal is already out of stock, so if you want these headphones you may want to act on it soon.</p>
