      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The NFL has flexed the Green Bay Packers’ trip to San Francisco to prime time on Nov. 24 along with announcing kickoff times for a handful of Week 16 games.</p>
      <p>With Tuesday’s announcement, the Packers (8-2) and 49ers (8-1) replace Seattle at Philadelphia, which now will kick off at 1 p.m. ET on Nov. 24. Carolina at New Orleans moves from FOX to CBS, while Miami at Cleveland switches from CBS to Fox with kickoff times unchanged for both games.</p>
      <p>The NFL had left the dates for some games for Week 16 undetermined.</p>
      <p>Now Houston will play Tampa Bay on Dec. 21 at 1 p.m. ET on NFL Network followed by Buffalo at New England at 4:30 p.m. ET, and the tripleheader will be capped by the Los Angeles Rams visiting San Francisco at 8:15 p.m. ET. On Dec. 22, Detroit now is scheduled to visit Denver with Oakland’s game at the Chargers both set for 4:05 p.m. ET kickoffs.</p>
