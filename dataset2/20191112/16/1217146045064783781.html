      <p>Adobe released security updates to address security issues that could allow attackers to execute malicious code remotely, elevate privileges, and gain unauthorized access to information on systems running unpatched Illustrator, Animate CC, Bridge CC, and Media Encoder versions.</p>
      <p>Of particular interest are the two critical memory corruption vulnerabilities that lead to remote code execution discovered in the Adobe Illustator software and tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-8247">CVE-2019-8247</a> and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-8248">CVE-2019-8248</a>.</p>
      <p>Since the program is widely used and these security issues could enable attackers to execute code on vulnerable machines, Adobe strongly advises users to update as soon as possible to lock potential exploitation attempts.</p>
      <p>The two RCE vulnerabilities found to affect Adobe Illustrator were reported by Kushal Arvind Shah of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs, while an additional privilege escalation issue rated as important severity and tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7962">CVE-2019-7962</a> was discovered and reported by Yongjun Liu of nsfocus security team.</p>
