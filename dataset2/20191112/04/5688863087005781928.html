        <b>Roston Chase, who was exceptional throughout the ODI series against Afghanistan, has revealed that it was his teammate Shai Hope’s advice on the field to keep getting singles for the win that he followed. Both Chase and Hope took West Indies to a five-wicket win in the third and final ODI.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Player of the series, in this recently concluded three-match contest in India, Chase was in all prolific role for the Windies. In the first ODI, the right-handed Chase scored a match-winning 94 and was extremely economic in his 10-over spell while also bagging a couple of wickets. In the second game he bagged three and with Nicholas Pooran’s help West Indies could seal tehir first series victory since 2014. </p>
      <p>On Monday, in the third and final ODI, Chase once again brought out his all-rounder skills and scored an unbeaten 32-ball 42 batting with Shai Hope, who scored 109 not out, and also sported figures of 24/1. Speaking of his performance yesterday, where Chase had to come in at No.5 instead of his usual No.4, he said it was Hope’s advice that kept him going.</p>
      <p>“Skipper[Kieron Pollard] told me last night we'll bat in a different position, but he said, 'Don't worry. Just concentrate on your bowling, and if you get a chance to bat, show that.' He said, 'Ros, just take over and play at a run-a-ball.' I did that, and put away the boundary balls. (On his bowling) I was just trying to vary my pace, and the pitch was helping out a lot. Each game, our bowlers came to the party. This is my first series win in five years, and I'm quite happy for that.,” Chase was quoted as saying, in the post-match presentation, by ESPNCricinfo.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Player of the Match Shai Hope said it was all about reading teh situationa nd batting through the innings. </p>
      <p>“It is good to contribute to team's win. I just put my hand up, someone had to bat through the innings. It is all about reading the situation of the match and as long as someone batted through, we were always going to win the game.” stated Hope.</p>
