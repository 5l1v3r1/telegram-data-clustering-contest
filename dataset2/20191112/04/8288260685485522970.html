      <h3>Steer injury blow</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa goalkeeper Jed Steer is reportedly facing up to two months out after scans revealed the extend of his injury.</p>
      <p>Steer was forced off inside eight minutes in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/wolves-vs-aston-villa-live-17231152">the 2-1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday</a> after hurting himself attempting to make a save.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old was making his first Premier League appearance of the season after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa’s</a> first-choice stopper Tom Heaton suffered a calf injury.</p>
      <p>But he hobbled off with the help of Villa’s medical staff, struggling to put any weight on his right leg.</p>
      <p>It was feared Steer had ruptured his Achilles but scans on Monday revealed that the problem isn’t as serious as that.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless he could be out until the New Year after suffering a calf injury, according to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11677/11859328/aston-villa-goalkeeper-jed-steer-out-for-two-months-with-calf-injury">Sky Sports.</a></p>
      <h3>Kalvin Phillips to Old Trafford?</h3>
      <p>Manchester United are closely monitoring Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was extensively linked with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> in the summer window as a number of Premier League clubs chased his signature.</p>
      <p>Phillips would ultimately sign a new deal at Elland Road, but that has done little to deter potential suitors from chasing the Leeds academy graduate.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-man-united-set-sights-on-leeds-duo/">Football Insider</a> have reported that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have been scouting Phillips and his Leeds teammate Ben White.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that talent spotters have been ‘blown away’ by Phillips’ performances, who continues to flourish under Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.</p>
      <h3>Disciplinary tightrope</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are in the midst of a major injury crisis.</p>
      <p>With seven defeats in their opening 12 Premier League games, Dean Smith's men sit one place above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>As well as losing their most recent game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, they were dealt the cruelest of hands on the injury front.</p>

      <p>Jack Grealish, Bjorn Engels and Tom Heaton all missed the game completely, whilst second choice keeper Jed Steer and Matt Targett limped out of the action at Molineux.</p>
      <p>All those now face a race to be fit for their Villa Park clash with Newcastle United, but on the horizon are a series of daunting looking fixture for the Villans.</p>
      <p>Following the game against the Magpies, Villa face Manchester United, Chelsea, Leicester and surprise package Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>And one man that faces missing one of those games is Frederic Guilbert. The Frenchman has been in fine form since coming into the side after his January move.</p>
      <h3>Mings admission</h3>
      <p>Tyrone Mings was left puzzled by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa’s</a> poor performance at Wolverhampton Wanderers, admitting: “It’s difficult to put a finger on it.”</p>
      <p>Villa were distinctly under-par as they allowed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/wolves-vs-aston-villa-live-17231152">Wolves to dominate proceedings at Molineux and claim a 2-1 win.</a></p>
      <p>Even that scoreline was kind on the visitors who slumped to their third consecutive Premier League defeat.</p>

      <p>Mings said afterwards: “Hopefully you won’t see many more performances like that (first-half). It couldn’t get much worse and second half was better.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to put a finger on it without looking back on it. I just didn’t think we were at the races - first contacts, second contacts, any 50/50s it didn’t seem like we were in for them. It was frustrating but in the second half we were better.</p>
      <p>“All we can do is work to put things right. You can’t be super low after every loss and super high after every win.</p>
      <p>“It’s a long season. We’ll try to maintain a level of consistency in our mood around the training ground and all we can do is work to put it right.”</p>
      <h3>How the fans see it</h3>
      <p>With the international break now upon us, it's time to take stock and see where <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> stand.</p>
      <p>Firstly, some context. Exactly one year ago today, Villa were sat in 11th place in the Championship, nine points behind the leaders and only eight away from the relegation zone.</p>

      <p>12 months later, Dean Smith's men find themselves in a much more desirable position, 17th in the top flight, three points clear of the bottom three with 11 points from their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>But that is not to say that Villa fans should be wholly satisfied, only two teams have tasted more defeats than the seven suffered by Smith's side - and the 20 goals conceded is only better than the sides currently below them.</p>
      <p>The latest defeat, a 2-1 reversal vs Wolves now means Villa have a long two weeks before they return to Premier League action against Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>With just under a third of the season gone, we asked Villa fans to outline some of the problems they believe their side are facing:</p>
      <p><b>Sean McGrath:</b> They (the players) seem to think we’re safe (if you listen to the pundits!!) and can put in lack lustre performances. the only thing that matters is points and you can only get that with 100 % graft and commitment on match day</p>
      <p><b>Howard James Clark:</b> Why do Villa persist with two wingers? Neither support their defensive duties. Both haven't the speed or skills to worry opposition. I know we are not Liverpool but both their full backs carry more threat going forward. Villa need to rethink the current set up.</p>
      <p><b>James Mumford: F</b> or me the problem must lay with the management / coaching staff. One thing is clear almost everytime we step on the field there never seems to be a clear strategy, we play like a bunch of individuals and very rarely as a team</p>
      <h3>'No words'</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa striker Wesley Moraes has posted a heartfelt message following his first ever call-up to the Brazilian national team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-star-receives-shock-17231325">The 22-year-old has been drafted into Tite’s squad</a> for the forthcoming matches against Argentina and South Korea after Ajax forward David Neres dropped out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wesley-moraes">Wesley</a> has never been involved in the youth ranks for Brazil with the selection his first involvement at any kind at international level.</p>

      <p>He took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4scvF7lbr5/">Instagram</a> following <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/wolves-vs-aston-villa-live-17231152">Sunday’s 2-1 defeat to Wolves</a> saying: “I am living a very special moment and I have no words to describe my happiness.</p>
      <p>“I always dreamed of representing Brazil and I will have the possibility of realising this dream.</p>
      <p>“I have had a hard time getting here and I will never forget the people who have helped me since the beginning of my career."</p>
