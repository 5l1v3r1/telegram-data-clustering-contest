      <h1>Hong Kong Protesters Stage Fiery Clash With Police</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T04:54:21+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 04:54</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Ives, Ezra Cheung and Katherine Li</a></address>
      <p>HONG KONG — Antigovernment demonstrators angered by the shooting of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/world/asia/photos-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">Hong Kong</a> demonstrator fanned out across the city on Tuesday, blocking major transit arteries and staging a fiery standoff against riot police officers on the fringes of a university campus.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/world/asia/photos-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">Protesters</a> disrupted the morning commute and brought parts of the central business district to a standstill around lunchtime. At the gates of the Chinese University of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/world/asia/photos-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">Hong Kong</a> on Tuesday evening, they set a giant blaze and threw gasoline bombs at police lines under a barrage of tear gas canisters.</p>
      <p>The protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/world/asia/what-are-hong-kong-protests-about.html?module=inline">began in June over a contentious, but since-withdrawn, extradition bill</a>. The demonstrations have since morphed into calls for greater democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Here’s the latest on the Hong Kong protests.</p>
      <h3>University campuses are new flash points.</h3>
      <p>Black-clad student demonstrators have been making a concerted effort to defend their campuses against what they see as unwarranted police encroachment.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, protesters at the Chinese University of Hong Kong built roadblocks outside an entrance while police officers elsewhere tackled demonstrators to the ground and fired tear gas at a group gathered on a sports field.</p>
      <p>As the clashes escalated in the evening, the university’s vice chancellor, Rocky Tuan, met with students in hopes of brokering a cease-fire between protesters and the police.</p>
      <p>“The deal is that we each need to take a step back,” he said as he urged the students not to escalate the confrontation. In response, the students shouted: “We don’t believe you!” They repeatedly interrupted him and called for the release of students who had been arrested.</p>
      <p>Barely minutes after Mr. Tuan left the site, the police fired tear gas at the protesters.</p>
      <p>The protesters poured more fuel onto a large barricade that they had already set ablaze. They hurled gasoline bombs, set off fireworks and chanted: “Reclaim Hong Kong, a revolution of our times,” a popular protest slogan.</p>
      <p>Officers fired a barrage of tear gas over the blockade, sending protesters scrambling. At least 30 people were being treated Tuesday night in a makeshift first-aid center on campus, apparently for exposure to tear gas and injuries from rubber bullets.</p>
      <p>Around 10 p.m., police cannons briefly sprayed blue-dyed water at protesters. Groups of officers began to retreat soon afterward, with the smell of tear gas and pepper spray still heavy on the air.</p>
      <p>Even though many confrontational protesters are undergraduates, violence on the campuses of Hong Kong’s universities has been rare. The university said that classes would be canceled on Wednesday for a third straight day in light of road blockages, “severe damage” to campus facilities and the “high risk of ongoing confrontation between protesters and the police.”</p>
      <h3>Leader chides protesters for transit chaos.</h3>
      <p>Carrie Lam, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/world/asia/china-xi-lam-hong-kong.html?module=inline">Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive</a>, criticized protesters on Tuesday for disrupting transit, saying that they were “extremely selfish” for wanting to paralyze Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Lam told reporters that the protesters were out to “create a phenomenon in which Hong Kong seems to have come to a standstill and people are not able to go to work and go to school.”</p>
      <p>School administrators should urge students to stop taking part in illegal activities, she said, adding that her government would do its “very best” to ensure that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/world/asia/joshua-wong-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">local elections planned for Nov. 24</a> were held in a “fair, just, safe, orderly” manner.</p>
      <p>Separately, People’s Daily, an official government newspaper in mainland China, said in a commentary: “Only by supporting the police force to decisively put down the riots can a peaceful environment be restored and fair elections be held, and help Hong Kong start again.”</p>
      <h3>There was more unrest downtown.</h3>
      <p>Hundreds of protesters, including many office workers, stormed Hong Kong’s central business district at lunchtime. Some formed human chains to pass along bags of bricks that front line activists were using to block traffic.</p>
      <p>Across the harbor, activists in the Mong Kok neighborhood placed barricades in front of buses and punctured their tires.</p>
      <p>The city’s subway operator said on Tuesday morning that services were also delayed after gasoline bombs had been thrown onto the tracks of a major rail line that runs to the border of the Chinese mainland.</p>
      <p>Large groups of commuters were seen walking along the line’s tracks — a rare scene in a city known for its efficiency and order.</p>
      <h3>The protests follow a day of widespread violence.</h3>
      <p>The demonstrations on Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">brought some of the worst violence that the city has seen in recent months</a>. Mrs. Lam, the city’s leader, called the combative protesters “enemies of the people” and warned that the city’s escalating unrest could take it on the “road of ruin.”</p>
      <p>A police officer shot a black-clad protester at point-blank range on Monday morning in a neighborhood where traffic had been snarled by roadblocks. Elsewhere, a man was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire after he scolded protesters, video footage shows. The police have said they are treating the immolation as an attempted murder.</p>
      <p>The medical status of the protester who was shot had improved to serious from critical condition by Tuesday morning, the Hospital Authority said. But the man who had been set on fire remained in critical condition.</p>
      <p>Tensions in Hong Kong had been building after the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-student-dies.html?module=inline">death last week of a student </a>who fell from a parking garage amid demonstrations.</p>
      <p>The police said that 287 people were arrested on Monday, the majority of them students.</p>
      <h3>The State Department urged both sides to exercise restraint.</h3>
      <p>On Monday night in Washington, the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the United States government condemned “violence on all sides" in Hong Kong and urged the government to “address the underlying concerns driving the protests.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Ortagus also reminded the Hong Kong government that the United States grants it a favorable trade status unlike that of mainland China, but only under specific conditions.</p>
      <p>Congress and President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/world/asia/hong-kong-protesters-call-for-us-help-china-sees-a-conspiracy.html?module=inline">could enact a bill</a> that mandates that the executive branch impose sanctions on Hong Kong officials who violate human rights and also review the special status of Hong Kong each year.</p>
      <p>Many protesters have called for the bill to be passed, thinking the new law would give them leverage, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/us/politics/elaine-chao-china.html?module=inline">Senator Mitch McConnell</a>, Republican of Kentucky and Senate leader, has not held a floor vote, even though the bill passed the House by unanimous consent.</p>
      <p>Edward Wong, Paul Mozur, Elaine Yu, and Tiffany May contributed reporting.</p>
