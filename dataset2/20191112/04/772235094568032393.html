      <p>Year-to-date in 2019 the brand is sitting on <b>73,944</b> reported sales, down <b>8.2 per cent</b> on the same point in 2018, amid an overall market decline of 8 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee will be succeeded by <b>Jun Heo</b>, who has been with Hyundai since 2000. He's worked in the USA, Mexico and India since joining the company.</p>
      <p>"I am proud and honoured to join Hyundai Motor Company Australia as Chief Executive Officer," said Mr Heo.</p>
      <p>"For market share, brand history and the popularity of models across the portfolio, Hyundai Australia is seen as one of our company’s most successful markets globally.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to play a key role as we develop our organisation as part of HMC’s global strategy. I look forward to working with the Australian team as we challenge the market in the future, through a dedication to progress, customer care and world-beating products."</p>
