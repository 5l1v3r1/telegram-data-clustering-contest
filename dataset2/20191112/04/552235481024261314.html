      <h1>Little Scots sisters face legal bid to stop violent dad who beat them from winning access case</h1>
      <h2>The 11 and eight-year-old siblings have written to Scotland's justice minister pleading for help after the brute was granted legal aid to begin his fight.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/children">Two young girls</a> are facing a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/court">court</a> fight to prevent the dad who assaulted them being allowed to see them again.</p>
      <p>One of the girls, Lucy (not her real name), 11, said: “They will have to physically drag me from my house. I never want to see him again.”</p>
      <p>And her little sister, eight, who we refer to as Joanne, said: “I am frightened to be with my dad in case he hurts us again.”</p>
      <p>The girls were shocked when, just a month after he was found guilty of assaulting them, their dad began legal proceedings to be allowed access again.</p>

      <p>Last month, he was given legal aid to begin his fight.</p>
      <p>The girls have sent a letter to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/justice">Justice Minister</a> Humza Yousaf, in which Lucy wrote: “People say that’s it's better to have two parents involved in your life, but our life was not better, it was awful.”</p>
      <p>Their mum Susan (not her real name) and dad split more than seven years ago.</p>
      <p>The girls refused to see him on one occasion because they were going to a cheerleader rehearsal.</p>
      <p>The next time they saw him, Lucy said their dad “shook us by the neck and said, ‘Make sure that doesn’t happen again’”.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She described how, on a trip to a caravan, he punched her in the stomach and grabbed Joanne by the throat.</p>
      <p>The girls told a teacher and their dad was given a community payback order in court.</p>
      <p>Labour’s justice spokesman James Kelly said “there are questions” to answer in the case.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottishgovernment">Scottish Government</a> spokesman said: “While we cannot comment on individual cases, we want to ensure that all victims and children are protected.”</p>
