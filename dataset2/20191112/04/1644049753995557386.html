      <h1>China denies World Bank cuts related to Uighur rights concerns</h1>

      <p>China said Tuesday that a World Bank decision to scale back a vocational education project was unrelated to allegations of mistreatment of minority Muslim Uighurs in the northwestern Xinjiang region.</p>
      <p>The World Bank launched a review in August of the programme after Foreign Policy magazine reported that a school which benefited from a tranche of the $50 million loan to China bought “barbed wire, gas launchers, and body armour”.</p>
      <p>Rights groups and experts say more than one million mostly Muslim ethnic minorities have been interned in re-education camps in Xinjiang, where they are being tortured and forced to renounce their religion.</p>
      <p>The World Bank said on Monday that its review “did not substantiate the allegations” but that it would cut funding to the scheme’s “partner schools” as a precautionary measure, because the schools were dispersed and difficult to monitor.</p>
      <p>But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday that the World Bank’s review of the programme “clarifies the truth while strongly rejecting the relevant accusations.”</p>
      <p>The “adjustments” announced by the World Bank are instead based on “based on the programmes’s actual needs,” said Geng at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>Geng said that the inspection showed that the project did not suffer from the problems “hyped up by foreign media.”</p>
      <p>The World Bank statement said Monday that the “scope and footprint of the project (with the partner schools) is being reduced.”</p>
      <p>“Specifically, the project component that involves the partner schools in Xinjiang is being closed,” it said.</p>
      <p>China’s treatment of the Uighurs — a mostly Muslim, Turkic-speaking minority concentrated in tightly-controlled Xinjiang — has come under growing scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Beijing initially denied the existence of the camps before admitting to running what it called “vocational education centres,” which it presented as necessary to combat religious extremism and boost employment.</p>
