      <p>During a town hall on CNN on Monday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden stated that he would bring veterans who were deported to their native countries after serving back to the United States.</p>
      <p>Biden was asked how he would “help veterans who served honorably, but then were deported back to their native country?”</p>
      <p>Biden responded, “Bring them back. … It’s outrageous what they did, outrageous what the president did.”</p>
      <p>He continued by discussing swearing in soldiers who weren’t U.S. citizens before stating, “We are a country of immigrants, and they served, and they should be treated the same way.”</p>
