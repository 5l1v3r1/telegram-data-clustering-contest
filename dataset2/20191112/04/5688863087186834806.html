        <b>India's stand-in T20I skipper Rohit Sharma lauded the bowlers for India's victory in the third T20I against Bangladesh. Though it was the Indian batting that put runs on the board by scoring 174 in the first innings, the Indian bowlers showed amazing control with the wet ball to restrict Bangladesh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>India beat Bangladesh by 30 runs in the series decider at Nagpur and the star of the show was Deepak Chahar who now has the best figures ever by a bowler in T20 internationals as he bagged six wickets conceding just seven runs in his quota of four overs. Skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> praised him and other bowlers for showing the tremendous ability of bowling with the ball being wet due to the dew present on the ground and he felt that the bowlers won the game for the team.</p>
      <p>"It were the bowlers who won us the game. I know how tough it was in the middle considering the dew factor," Rohit said in the post-match presentation ceremony, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.</p>
      <p>"At one stage it was looking easy for them when they needed 70-odd of 8 overs; things were looking tough for us. It was a great comeback from us. The boys took responsibility and raised their hands up," he further added.</p>
      <p>The Indian captain also praised <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kl_rahul">KL Rahul</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a> for producing the impetus the Indian innings needed from the middle order to help them give a good score. Shreyas told after the match that it was the inspiring words of Rohit that helped the team win and the skipper mentioned in the presentation the things that he spoke in the team huddle.</p>
      <p>"I just reminded them this (pointing towards the badge on the jersey) is what we are playing for. I can understand when wickets are not falling, it's hard to pick ourselves up. I just had to remind what team they're playing for, credit to the bowlers," Rohit asserted.</p>
      <p>"Also to the batsmen - the way Rahul and Iyer played, that was magnificent. That is what we want from the team - individuals taking the responsibility," he added.</p>
      <p>With the T20I series in the bag, the stand-in skipper for India said that they were looking at the bigger picture too, that is, finding the right team combination for the T20 World Cup. India have not won this showpiece event since the inaugural edition in 2007 and will look to form a strong core and perform well in Australia next year.</p>
      <p>"Until we get close to the World Cup, we got to find the right balance. There are a few guys missing, but they'll come back," Rohit said.</p>
      <p>"Keeping everything in mind, we have few games in mind before we get into that flight to Australia. If we keep performing like we did today, it's going to be a big headache for Virat and the selectors," he concluded</p>
