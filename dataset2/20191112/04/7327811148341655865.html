      <p>BEDFORD-STUYVESANT, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police are searching for a dog that was stolen from outside a McDonald's in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>The dog, a 2-year-old American Bully named Havok, had been tied to a lamp post Nov. 7 outside the restaurant on Broadway in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>
      <p>The owner was watching him through a window as he quickly ordered food, police said. When he went to pay, Havok was gone.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video obtained by the owner from a local pharmacy shows a man running away with the dog.</p>
      <p>Havok is a black dog with a white chest, white on the right side of his nose, and a white ring around his neck.</p>
