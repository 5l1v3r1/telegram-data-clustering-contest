      <p>The mum of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane burst into tears as she heard evidence about her daughter's injuries in court today.</p>
      <p>Gillian Millane cried as a forensic pathologist described how Grace's bruises suggested she had been pinned down with force.</p>
      <p>Dr Simon Stables said he was sure the backpacker died from strangulation after he found a deep internal bruise in her neck.</p>
      <p>Watched by Grace’s tearful mother and father in the public gallery, Dr Stables showed Auckland High Court a series of photographs from a post-mortem he carried out in December last year.</p>
      <p>He added that Grace's death was the first case he had seen in New Zealand of manual strangulation during sex.</p>

      <p>“From my point of view it is incredibly rare. I have never heard of another case... in New Zealand,” said the doctor.</p>
      <p>He told the court that a pattern of bruises on Grace's chest and arms indicated she had been held down.</p>
      <p>Her alleged killer, 27, says Grace died accidentally during consensual sex after she asked him to choke her during a Tinder date at his apartment last December.</p>

      <p>Describing the cause of death as “pressure to the neck”, Dr Stables said it would need to have been sustained for four or five minutes.</p>
      <p>“It’s not going to happen with a gentle touch,” he told the jury. “It’s got to be with some force. It takes quite a bit of effort.”</p>
      <p>The bruise was deep inside the neck, he said, and invisible on the surface, suggesting it happened at the time of death.</p>
      <p>Other, blue bruises on her torso, he said, were “consistent with some level of restraint.”</p>

      <p>Dr Stables rejected a suggestion from defence barrister Ian Brookie that one or more of the bruises could have been a “love bite”.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t resemble one I’ve seen in my experience,” he said.</p>
      <p>But he did agree that some of the bruising on the 21-year-old’s arms could be the result of “consensual but physical sex”.</p>
      <p>Despite the effects of a week of decomposition before her body was found by tracking the accused’s cellphone, Dr Stables he had no doubt about the bruise, about six centimetres by three below the lefty side of Grace’s jaw, being caused before death.</p>
      <p>“I think it is not a post mortem change, it is a real injury,” he said.</p>

      <p>Dr Stables said that obstructing the bloodflow or the airways in the neck to cause death by cutting oxygen to the brain would require between two and five kilograms of pressure.</p>
      <p>And he added: “A 22-year-old woman with no medical history, I wouldn't expect to bruise easily.”</p>
      <p>Mr Brookie told Dr Stables the defence would not challenge the finding of death by manual strangulation but would suggest alcohol had played a part after Grace and the accused had spent the evening drinking cocktails and tequila shots in a number of bars.</p>
      <p>Dr Stables had told prosecutor Brian Dickey that alcohol can “sensitise the heart”, but he said results of a toxicology test showing levels in Grace’s blood of twice the legal driving limit were meaningless because of the effects of decomposition.</p>
      <p>The defendant denies murder.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
