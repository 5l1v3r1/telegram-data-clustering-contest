      </p>
      <p>The NPA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).</p>
      <p>One of the militants was killed the in yesterday’s firefight, while an uncertain number <a href="https://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2019/11/12/6-soldiers-dead-npa-clash-eastern-samar.html?fbclid=IwAR3CAUZ0VFOhHQ19tV3cIhGzhPRojFRmYlvVe09HgsZ9V6CeWul4xLYPXak">were wounded</a>, according to <i>CNN Philippines</i>. The army has yet to identify the killed fighter.</p>
      <p>The NPA has been waging an insurgency against the government since 1969. It operates in rural areas and extorts money from local businesses to fund its communist movement. President Rodrigo Duterte’s government previously engaged the CPP in peace talks, but they was <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/21/19/duterte-announces-permanent-termination-of-peace-talks-with-reds">permanently terminated in March.</a></p>
      <p>The CPP’s founder, Jose Maria Sison, proved that there’s no love lost between him and Duterte after the former said on Monday that <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/715072/sick-and-using-fentanyl-duterte-should-yield-to-leni-joma-sison/story/">the president should just resign</a> due to his alleged health problems.</p>
      <p>Duterte was supposed to go on leave for three days this week, but his spokesman Salvador Panelo said he would work from his house in Davao City instead.</p>
