        <b>Skipper Kieron Pollard has expressed how winning is a habit and the process of actually making it happen is one department where West Indies has significantly improved. Pollard further credited all his players for performing as planned ahead of the series against Afghanistan, which they won 3-0.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pollard and his men never looked lost in this series and made home for themselves, playing the three-match ODI series against Afghanistan, in India. The third and final ODI, played on Sunday, was won by the West Indies with a margin of five wickets. Shai Hope scored an unbeaten hundred while reaching the target of 250, while <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/roston_chase">Roston Chase</a> partnered with a 32-ball 42 not out. </p>
      <p>The Windies skipper believes it was all about the team character which has helped them make winning a habit and it’s his entire team’s credit. </p>
      <p>“We are thankful to God for giving us this opportunity. We came here with a mission and specific roles for players, and all the players deserve credit,” Pollard was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the 3-0 whitewash that they imposed on Afghanistan, Pollard said, that everything that has come along in the process has made them improve and this was the opportunity to show what they can do.</p>
      <p>“Winning is a habit, and anything that we want to do as a team is a process, and it's something we had to improve in a period of time. This was an opportunity for us to show we have that kind of venom inside us. We knew we had to rally as a team, and we proved we can bat 50 overs, and once we do that, we can win games,“ he added.</p>
      <p>Finally, the captain heavily praised his two big guns Shai Hope and Roston Chase, the Player of the Match and Series, respectively. </p>
      <p>“Everything you do is a process, but Shai showed again how good he can bat. King in his first bat batted well, and Roston again batted well. Credit to those in the support staff also for helping the team."</p>
