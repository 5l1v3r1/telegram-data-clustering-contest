      <h1>Siam Square One evacuated after fire breaks out in hotpot restaurant (Video)</h1>

      <p>Investigators today were still trying to determine what caused a fire to break out at a hotpot restaurant on the fifth floor of a busy downtown shopping mall.</p>
      <p>Smoke cloaked the area around the Siam Square One shopping mall last night after a small blaze erupted at Hongdae, a Korean charcoal barbecue buffet restaurant, at about 7:30pm. There were no reported injuries. </p>
      <p>“We’re currently going through the evidence and remnants in order to determine the cause of the fire and how much damage was caused. Since it just happened last night, we don’t know the cause yet,” police spokesman Col. Krissana Phatthanacharoen told<i> Coconuts Bangkok </i>this morning. He did not know how long it took for firefighters to bring it under control.  </p>
      <p>Video shot from near the fire shows thick clouds of smoke as shoppers, tourists and staff were evacuated from the shopping mall. </p>
