      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): The FBM KLCI reversed its earlier loss and climbed 0.18% at the midday break today, lifted by gains including at Tenaga Nasional Bhd.</p>
      <p>At 12.30pm, the FBM KLCI rose 2.83 points to 1,610.98.The index had earlier slipped to a low of 1,605.71.</p>
      <p>Gainers led losers by 259 to 252, while 555 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 1.34 billion shares valued at RM729.96 million.</p>
      <p>The gainers included Nestle (M) Bhd, Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd, Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Tenaga, Magni-Tech Industries Bhd and Pintaras Jaya Bhd.</p>
      <p>The actives included Sapura Energy Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, DGB Asia Bhd, AirAsia X Bhd, Tanco Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd and Sanichi Technology Bhd.</p>
      <p>The decliners included Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, KESM Industries Bhd, ViTrox Corp Bhd, Bursa Malaysia Bhd, Latitude Tree Holdings Bhd, Manulife Holdings Bhd and Padini Holdings Bhd.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>said Asian share markets flatlined on Tuesday as uncertainty over Sino-US trade talks and political strife in Hong Kong dogged sentiment, while safe-haven bonds eked out a bounce.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up a slight 0.04%, following a sharp 1.2% pullback on Monday, it said.</p>
      <p>Affin Hwang Capital Research said the FBM KLCI Index turned slightly lower in yesterday's session, dropping 1.58 points or 0.1%, closing at 1,608.15.</p>
      <p>"Note that the 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) is attempting to cross above the 50-day EMA. A successful cross above would indicate a short-term "buy" signal as well as a bullish outlook.</p>
      <p>"Overall, remain view that the index will retest the 1,615-1,620 immediate resistance moving forward.</p>
      <p>"Nonetheless, external factors such as geopolitical risks particularly in Hong Kong might dampen short-term bullish sentiments, hence limiting the upside potential of global equity markets. Technical relief rebound in progress," it said.</p>
