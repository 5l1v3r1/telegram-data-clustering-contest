      <p>At launch, Disney+ already has one of the biggest back catalogs of content among the major streaming services, stretching back over a half century to include classic Disney films like <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</i>, <i>Bambi</i>, and <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>. Disney+ content ranges from 1937 to 2019, essentially including every film produced under The Walt Disney company umbrella, as well as its subsidiaries including Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. <br/><br/>In addition to classic content, Disney is producing new shows, movies, and documentaries for Disney+. Today you can watch new TV shows like <i>The Mandalorian</i>, <i>Encore!</i>, <i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i>, and <i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i>. Original movies include <i>Noelle</i> starring Anna Kendrick and the <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> reboot starring Justin Theroux and Tessa Thompson. There are also behind-the-scenes looks at aspects of the Disney company, including <i>One Day at Disney</i>, which highlights daily routines of cast members at Disney Parks. <br/><br/>Disney+ is launching just a few days after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-plus-launch/">debuted</a> its own streaming TV service, which also uses the "plus" naming style, called ‌Apple TV‌+. On Apple's service you can pay $4.99/month to watch a handful of original TV shows like <i>The Morning Show</i>, <i>For All Mankind</i>, <i>Dickinson</i>, <i>See</i>, <i>Ghostwriter</i>, <i>Helpsters</i>, and <i>Snoopy in Space</i>. Apple plans to add new shows and movies monthly, next up including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/06/apple-full-trailer-servant/"><i>Servant</i> from producer M. Night Shyamalan</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/04/apple-tv-film-the-banker/"><i>The Banker</i> with Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie</a>. <br/><br/>Disney+ is compatible with the ‌Apple TV‌ app, so all of the TV shows and movies you stream in the Disney+ app will be updated and added to Up Next in the TV app, which also syncs to iOS. For more information on Disney+ and all of the content that you can watch inside of the new service, <a href="https://preview.disneyplus.com/">check out Disney's website</a> and head to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/app-store/">App Store</a> to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney/id1446075923">download the app</a> on iOS today. <br/><br/>Disney+ is also now available in Canada and the Netherlands. The service will launch in Australia and New Zealand on November 19, 2019, followed by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain on March 31, 2020.</p>
