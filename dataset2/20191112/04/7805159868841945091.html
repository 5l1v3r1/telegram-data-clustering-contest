      <h1>Samsung Galaxy A51 renders show off 48MP quad rear cameras and punch-hole display</h1>

      <p>It’s just been over a month since Samsung launched the Galaxy A50s in India. The premium mid-ranger from the company packed in an Exynos 9611 chip, coupled with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also featured a triple camera setup on the back, with a 48MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 5MP depth sensor. While it hasn’t been all that long since its release, Samsung seems to be prepping up for the release of its successor, the Galaxy A51. Leaked renders of the device have now surfaced online, revealing some key design changes and features.</p>

      <p>Infamous leakster <i>@OnLeaks</i> recently shared a couple of high-quality renders and a 360-degree video of the upcoming Galaxy A51.  The renders suggest that the Galaxy A51 will feature a 6.5-inch punch-hole display, like the one found on the company’s flagship devices, with minimal bezels on all sides.</p>

      <p>On the back, the device will feature a new rectangular camera module which will include four cameras in an L-shaped array, along with an LED flash. Unlike the front of the device, the back panel will feature curved edges with the Samsung branding in the center. The renders don’t include a fingerprint scanner on the back which leads us to believe that the A51 will feature an in-display fingerprint scanner, just like its predecessor.</p>

      <p>Both the power button and volume rocker can be found on the right edge of the device, while the SIM card tray is on the left. On the bottom edge, the Galaxy A51 will feature a USB Type-C port for charging and data syncing, along with a single loudspeaker grill and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Previous <a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1191397503821742086">leaks suggest</a> that the Galaxy A51 will feature a substantial 4,000mAh battery and will run One UI 2.0 out of the box. Furthermore, the quad-camera setup will likely include a 48MP primary sensor, a 12MP wide-angle sensor, a 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom and a 5MP depth sensor. Up on the front, the device will feature a single 32MP selfie shooter.</p>
      <p>A Geekbench listing of the device suggests that it will be powered by the Exynos 9611 chip, along with at least 4GB of RAM. However, we aren’t sure if the Geekbench listing is a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-xl-5g-fake/">reliable source</a>. As of now, there’s no further information from the company regarding the device or its release timeline. But we expect to learn more as its launch draws closer.</p>
