      <p>PARIS: Former half-marathon world record holder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kenya">Kenya</a>'s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abraham-Kiptumhas">Abraham Kiptumhas</a> been given a four-year doping ban, the Athletics Integrity Unit said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The ban follows irregularities that showed up on Kiptumhas' biological passport, which is used to track potential doping.</p>
      <p>"The World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal has banned the long-distance runner for four-years with effect from 28 April 2019," a statement on Twitter said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Tribunal suspects the 30-year-old Kiptumhas of blood doping, but the athlete has denied any form of doping or blood manipulation.</p>
