      <h1>Liverpool 'in advanced talks' with Bournemouth over transfer of Arsenal target Ryan Fraser</h1>
      <h2>Fraser was the Premier League's second highest assist king last season and could be involved in a January deal involving Liverpool's on-loan ace Harry Wilson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T04:40:25+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 04:40</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are reportedly in advanced talks to sign Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser in the January transfer window after he was linked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> over the summer.</p>
      <p>Fraser was on Arsenal's radar in the summer following an impressive season with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> as he notched 14 Premier League assists.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international's haul was the second highest tally in the league behind then <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> player Eden Hazard.</p>
      <p>He has not repeated that form this season, amid speculation that relations have broken down between the 25-year-old and manager Eddie Howe.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth are hoping to cash in on the £27m-rated flyer when the transfer window reopens rather than lose him for nothing when his contract expires next summer.</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are leading the race to land him, with on-loan Reds winger Harry Wilson possibly set to sign permanently for Bournemouth as part of the deal.</p>
      <p>That's according to <a href="https://talksport.com/football/628484/liverpool-talks-january-ryan-fraser-transfer-bournemouth-harry-wilson/">TalkSport</a> , who claim the club is in advanced talks with Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>TalkSport correspondent Alex Crook, who said: "My understanding is Jurgen Klopp is lining up a surprise move for Bournemouth’s Ryan Fraser.</p>
      <p>“You can understand why Bournemouth have tried to hold on to him but I think now a move in January would suit all parties.</p>

      <p>“He would be a great signing for Liverpool. He is not going to get in that front three ahead of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane, but what an option off the bench."</p>
      <p>With his contract running down, Liverpool may be able to land Wilson for a cut price £10m.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated the Cherries could ask Liverpool to sweeten the deal by offering Wales winger Wilson as part of the exchange.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has scored four goals in 11 appearances on loan at Bournemouth this season, having been Derby County's top scorer during his loan spell with the Championship club last term.</p>
