      <p>Addressing a news conference after attending the economic team’s meeting, Adviser on Finance Sheikh said, “The country is heading towards stability as the dollar reserves are rising and rupee is maintaining stability.</p>

      <p>Shaikh was flanked by economic affairs minister, FBR chairman and special assistant on information.</p>
      <p>Shaikh said that the country’s foreign exchange reserves and exports had started rising after a lapse of five years while a 16% increase in revenues was reported by the FBR.</p>
      <p>“The trade deficit is on a continuous decline while the stock market has been showing improvements over the past several weeks,” said Shaikh. “The IMF has given a go ahead for the second instalment realising that Pakistan has fulfilled its commitments, while IMF president has also lauded the economic reforms in Pakistan.”</p>

      <p>“In addition, we have allocated Rs30 billion for tax refund while Rs250 billion has been allocated for circular debt repayment. We can progress when the country is earning dollars. There has been a remarkable improvement in international trade as our exports have risen by 4%,” said Shaikh. “On the other hand, the foreign exchange reserves.”</p>
      <p>Shaikh also announced that the State Bank had increased the loan limit for commercial banks by Rs100 billion, adding that the incentives given to the business community had started bearing positive results for the economy.</p>

      <p>He said, “Unfortunately, some products are being smuggled from Pakistan to Afghanistan and Central Asia. However, we are taking measures to combat smuggling.”</p>
      <p>Shaikh said, “The Centre is deliberating with all four provinces over the issue of the NFC Award. We have no objection if someone wants tax refund in the form of cash rather than bond. We have set aside Rs30 billion as cash against cancelled bonds. The government will pay off the circular debt by borrowing Rs250 billion.”</p>
      <p>The finance adviser announced that the government allocated Rs152 billion for erstwhile Fata in the budget, “something which is unprecedented in country’s history”.</p>
      <p>Shaikh said the government slashed its expenditures and decided not to borrow from the State Bank. “We have not ordered printing of new currency notes during the past four months,” he added.<br/>Federal Minister Hammad Azhar said the country’s foreign exchange reserves were showing stability while the reserves had increased by $1.2 billion since July. “The government as well as the State Bank will bear Rs200 billion subsidy for exporters.
