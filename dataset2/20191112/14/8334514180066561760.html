      <p>They will need more parties to join them to have a majority in parliament.</p>
      <p>Following are the key points of the deal:</p>
      <p>* Make Spain a point of reference in social rights in Europe; defend freedom, tolerance and respect democratic values</p>
      <p>* Consolidate economic growth and job creation, combat precarious labour conditions</p>
      <p>* Fiscal justice and budget balance. Spending controls are essential for solid and lasting wellbeing of the state</p>
      <p>* Guarantee coexistence in Catalonia and normalise political life there after a secession crisis by promoting dialogue and seeking understanding, always based on the Spanish Constitution</p>
      <p>* Strengthen autonomy of the regions, guaranteeing equality for all Spaniards</p>
      <p>* Fight corruption</p>
      <p>* Protect public services, especially in education and healthcare</p>
      <p>* Ensure the sustainability of the pension system and pension adjustments to the cost of living</p>
      <p>* Housing as a right and not a commodity</p>
      <p>* Fight climate change</p>
      <p>* Strengthen small and medium-sized companies, make a push for reindustrialisation</p>
      <p>* Ensure the right to dignified death, euthanasia</p>
      <p>* Safeguard diversity, fight male chauvinist violence, promote gender equality.</p>
