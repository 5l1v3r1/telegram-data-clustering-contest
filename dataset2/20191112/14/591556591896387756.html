      <p>Kids just get whatever they want these days.<br/><br/>At least that's what I hear from pained helicopter parents.<br/><br/>Most kids, however, tend not to use ingenious tactics, instead of resorting to whining "I want" over and over again until they get their way.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/topic/samsung/">Samsung</a>, however, wants kids to believe there's a better, more imaginative route. <br/><br/>Step one: Make sure there are <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/best-phones-of-2019-iphone-11-galaxy-note-10/">Samsung devices</a> all over the house. Step two: When your parents don't instantly give in, pester their every Samsung screen with your demand. Because you, being a kid, know how to do that.</p>
      <p>The message -- of wonderful, Apple-like device connectivity -- is presented here with the new "<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tags/star-wars/">Star Wars</a>" movie as the background.<br/><br/>A wily brat, who wears his baseball cap on backward in the house, is desperate to adopt a dog that looks like Chewbacca.</p>
      <p>Why does he want to do this? Because the dog is at an animal shelter and has become internet-famous. <br/><br/>Why else would a kid care about a dog?</p>
      <p>Dad, however, doesn't seem moved about having a Chewbacca dog in the house.<br/><br/>So his endearing son decides to pester dad by transmitting a picture of the Chewbacca dog -- aka #RescueChewieDog -- onto dad's computer.<br/><br/>When that doesn't work, the kid sends it to dad's Galaxy Watch. Yes, when dad's in bed asleep.<br/><br/>A thoughtful kid, this.<br/><br/>Finally, he does the unthinkable, the sacrilegious. He interrupts a soccer match on TV with a picture of the dog.<br/><br/>Why would any animal rescue shelter entrust a dog to this infernally selfish child? <br/><br/>Still, technological nagging works. Dad and son go to the shelter. Only to discover they're too late. Chewie will be solo no more. He's found a home.<br/><br/>But then the son espies a Darth Vader cat.<br/><br/>It's all beautifully done -- at least in the 60-second version. (There's a 30-second cutdown which is largely incomprehensible.)<br/><br/>The teen bears more than a passing resemblance to a young Kylo Ren. The two animals are utterly winning. <br/><br/>Samsung believes the ad has a simple message: "Seamless connectivity between Galaxy devices brings you together with what you love."<br/><br/>A more objective alternative might be: "Annoy those you love until you get what you want."<br/><br/>I feel sure it'll be a great success.</p>
