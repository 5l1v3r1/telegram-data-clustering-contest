      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The president of the University of Southern California responded after at least seven students have died since August.<br/><br/>President Carol Folt sent a letter to the USC community refuting claims that most of the deaths are attributed to suicide.<br/><br/>"These tragic losses have resulted from a number of different causes. In some cases the cause of death is still undetermined, and in others the loved ones do not want details disclosed," Folt wrote.<br/><br/>A USC freshman died in late August after he was <a href="https://abc7.com/usc-student-fatally-struck-by-2-cars-on-110-freeway-in-dtla/5494144/">struck by two vehicles on the 110 Freeway</a> near downtown Los Angeles.<br/><br/>A report of on-campus incidents revealed two students died by suicide and seven attempted suicides were reported between September and November.<br/><br/>The campus newspaper, the Daily Trojan, reports students are demanding answers amid the tragedies, and some are <a href="https://dailytrojan.com/2019/11/11/a-community-in-mourning/">frustrated with the campus' wellness resources</a>.<br/><br/>However, USC officials urged students in need to seek help. A 24-hour hotline is available at 213-740-9355, and students can walk into the USC Student Health centers for professional assistance.</p>
