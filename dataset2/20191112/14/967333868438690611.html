      <p>Deyjah Harris, daughter of famous American rapper Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. known professionally as "T.I.", is no longer following her father on Instagram, E! News reports.</p>
      <p>As the media outlet points out, it wasn’t immediately clear when exactly Deyjah performed this move, speculations abound that it took place after the rapper said during a recent "Ladies Like Us" podcast that he takes his daughter to gynecologist for regular hymen checks.</p>
      <blockquote>"But I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact," T.I. said.</blockquote>
      <p>Also, it appears that Deyjah is no longer following T.I.'s wife, Tameka "Tiny" Cottle, and her stepsister Zonnique Pullins on Instagram, though she does follow Tiny on Twitter, Hollywood Unlocked notes.</p>
      <p>T.I.'s actions have, perhaps predictably, evoked a wave of outrage online.</p>

      <p>​Some apparently took a dim view of the way this issue was covered by media.</p>

      <p>​And yet there were also those who offered a different take on the rapper’s behavior.</p>
