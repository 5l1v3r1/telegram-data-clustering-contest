      <h1>Verstappen says Hamilton's F1 dominance "getting a bit boring"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:19:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author">Nicolás Quarles van Ufford</a></address>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> star <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> thinks the dominance of his rival <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> is <i>"getting a bit boring"</i>, with the Brit winning five of the last six championships.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Verstappen is part of a young generation that is challenging the established star at the top of the sport, with Hamilton being the top dog in his <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a>, breaking almost every record in his sight as he's just one title away from equalling Michael Schumacher's legendary seven championships.</p>

      <p>At 34 years old, 35 by the start of next season, Hamilton is the second oldest driver on the grid after <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a>.</p>
      <p>As for Verstappen, who has become one of the poster boys for F1 ever since his arrival in the sport, he likes seeing a lot of younger drivers in Formula 1, as he has grown tired of Hamilton's constant winning.</p>
      <p><i>“I think it’s good for the sport to have the young guys now coming up and hopefully taking over very soon,” </i>the 22-year-old said at an event for his sponsor <i>CarNext.com</i>.</p>
      <p><i>“It’s getting a bit boring seeing Lewis win, so we have to try and change that,” </i>he jokingly added.</p>
      <p>Verstappen has beaten nearly every record in his path as well, becoming the youngest driver, points scorer and Grand Prix winner in F1 history among other things. Red Bull's goal has always been to make him the youngest ever world champion, however, and time is running out for this. Next season will be his last chance to beat current record holder Sebastian Vettel.</p>

      <p>To get the record, he'll have to go through Hamilton among others, and Verstappen knows it will be up to their respective teams to determine if he can challenge the six-time champion.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“He’s getting older, so for sure it will stop at one point. It’s just going to depend on the team, to be honest. It’s not going to depend on Lewis.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“If Mercedes keeps building really dominant cars, for sure he’s going to win. So we just have to make sure as a team that we can beat them.”</i>
