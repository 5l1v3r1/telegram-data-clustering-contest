      <p>According to <i>Gazzetta dello Sport</i>, the 34-year-old Portuguese forward will dodge punishment for reportedly calling manager Maurizio Sarri a “son of a whore” before storming down the tunnel to the changing rooms, but will be expected to apologise to his team-mates for not returning to the bench.</p>

      <p>​Ronaldo risked receiving a two-year ban due to anti-doping regulations after there were concerns that he left the Allianz Stadium early.</p>
      <p><i>Sky Sport Italia</i>, as per <i>Football Italia</i>, reported that Ronaldo left the stadium three minutes before full-time on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri confirmed after the game that there was no issue with Ronaldo and that he <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201911071077247914-ronaldo-juventus-boss-emotional-reaction/">understands his frustrations</a>.</p>
      <p>The manager of Serie A club Juventus explained that injury was behind the reason why he brought Ronaldo off in the second half.</p>
      <blockquote>“We must thank Ronaldo, because he made a sacrifice to be there at all tonight in a difficult situation,” Sarri explained.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“He did everything possible to play, but I saw he was not well and thought it best to take him off. It’s only natural a player is going to be irritated to leave the pitch, especially when he worked so hard to be there.”</blockquote>
      <p>Sarri insisted that Ronaldo had been experiencing a knee problem after receiving “a knock in training” which had “hurt the collateral ligament”.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo broke his silence on Monday morning by taking to social media.</p>
      <p>While refusing to acknowledge his recent outburst, he posted the brief comment:</p>
      <p>“Difficult game, important victory! #until the end.”</p>

      <p>​Cristiano Ronaldo’s lack of punishment for the outburst has some criticising the fact that the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910011076938638-ronaldo-mocked-online-after-revealing-his-post-football-ambitions/">five-time Ballon d’Or winner</a> is seemingly above the law, according to <i>Corriere dello Sport</i>.</p>
      <p>Currently, Ronaldo is away on international duty with Portugal and will return for Juventus’ next Serie A clash with Atalanta in 11 days time.</p>
