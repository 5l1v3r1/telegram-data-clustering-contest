      <h1>Scientists Find Fossilized Footprints ‘Hiding’ in Mammoth Tracks</h1>

      <p><a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/11/ghost-footprints-pleistocene-made-visible">Researchers uncovered fossilized footprints</a>—and what lies beneath them—in the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Hidden since the end of the last ice age, the invisible markings reveal a treasure trove of information about how humans and animals interacted 12,000 years ago.</p>
      <p>A team, led by Cornell University research scientist Thomas Urban, used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to examine the footprints of humans, <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/boy-finds-rare-woolly-mammoth-tooth-outside-ohio-resort-1800004/">mammoths</a>, and giant sloths.</p>
      <p>“We never thought to look under footprints,” Urban said in a statement. “But it turns out that the sediment itself has a memory that records the effects of the animal’s weight and momentum in a beautiful way.</p>
      <p>“It gives us a way to understand the biomechanics of extinct fauna that we never had before,” he added.</p>
      <p>Nondestructive GPR lets analysts access hidden information without excavation. Rather, users drag a sensor over the surface, sending a radio wave into the ground. The signal bouncing back provides a picture of what’s underground.</p>
      <p>Including details about pressure and momentum of the <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/woolly-mammoths-neanderthals-may-have-shared-genetic-traits-1782141/">extinct foot and body</a> making those tracks.</p>
      <p>Sure, these “ghost” footprints may become visible for a short time after rain, or when conditions are <i>just right</i>.</p>
      <p>But now, using geophysics methods, they can be recorded, traced, and investigated in 3D to reveal animal and human interactions, history, and mechanics “in genuinely exciting new ways,” study co-author and Cornell professor Sturt Manning said.</p>
      <p>The novel approach also gives researchers a way to learn about what early humans did when they weren’t at a camp or kill site—the two archaeological scenes best known for this time period.</p>
      <p>“The GPR technique gets us to the space in between [sites] and lets us see how people are tracking animals or moving around for other tasks of daily life,” Urban explained.</p>
      <p>“There are very few footprint records for human-megafauna interactions,” he continued. “It’s really rare to have access to this kind of data from 12,000 or more years ago.”</p>
      <p>Ground-penetrating radar has bigger implications than just this case study, according to Urban, who suggested the method could be applied to other fossilized footprint sites—including those of dinosaurs.</p>
      <p>“We have already successfully tested the method more broadly at multiple locations within White Sands,” he said.</p>
