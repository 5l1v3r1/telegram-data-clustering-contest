      <p>SIDNEY, Ohio: At the entrance to Sidney High School in small-town Ohio, there is a poster which reads: "Inside this building, our children are protected by an armed and trained response team."</p>
      <p>In rural Shelby County, law enforcement trained some teachers to fight back, should an attacker threaten students. They were among the first in the United States to embrace the controversial strategy.</p>

      <p>On Halloween, as high school students and staff roam the hallways, John Pence - a firearm on his belt - patrols calmly.</p>

      <p>He is a full-time resource officer, assigned to ensure security at Sidney High. That arrangement has become commonplace across the country, as the number of school shootings has multiplied.</p>
      <p>But he has back-up: the response team of armed teachers, who have volunteered for the job.</p>
      <p>So far, about 15 US states have approved similar set-ups, but many are not happy about putting weapons in the hands of educators.</p>
      <p>Pence rejects the usual arguments, saying: "In some areas, probably it might not work - maybe in a city. But most of these employees have been exposed to some type of firearms training beforehand."</p>
      <p>One Sidney teacher, who cannot be named in order to protect the confidential nature of the armed response team, is indeed one such case. He is an avid hunter.</p>
      <p>He says he had "no fears, no hesitations" about joining the effort to safeguard the school - even if that means that one day, he could find himself faced with the prospect of shooting at one of his students.</p>
      <p>"That's one of those boxes that mentally you can have to check," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>"I have a wife and I have kids so if anybody is going to try to do any harm to them, this is what I'm going to do - this is what has to be done if it's a student that is causing the threat.</p>
      <p>"The other students being threatened, they have the right to go home to their parents that night too."</p>

        <b>A DEATH EVERY 17 SECONDS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The idea of arming teachers - the "program" as those in Sidney call it - first surfaced after the Newtown shooting in 2012, in which 26 people, including 20 children, were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school.</p>
      <p>The shooter also shot and killed his mother before taking his own life.</p>
      <p>After that horrific attack, Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart says he realised how vulnerable the schools in his area were.</p>
      <p>He pushed for new safety measures as he contemplated a hard truth: "The rule of thumb is after the first shot is fired, every 17 seconds after that, somebody dies. So you need an immediate response."</p>
      <p>But he never suggested that teachers should give lessons or patrol the hallways with a firearm on their hips.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want our schools to look like the Wild Wild West, like an armed fortress," said Lenhart, who sports a thin white mustache.</p>
      <p>The response team has access to 9mm Glock pistols, which are kept - along with the ammunition - in small black safes that only open when the digital fingerprint of an authorized user is scanned.</p>
      <p>Bob Humble, the superintendent of Sidney's school district, which accounts for 3,500 students in six buildings, is proud of being a trailblazer.</p>
      <p>He thinks that in addition to ensuring a quick response in case of an emergency, the team offers a compelling deterrent to any "crazy people with guns".</p>
      <p>"Their goal is to get the highest body count they can in the shortest amount of time," Humble says.</p>
      <p>"This is why I think the chances of this happening are very low now, simply because they know someone's going to take them down in a hurry."</p>
      <p>For Humble, having such a security team "is just common sense".</p>
      <p>"The kids don't think anything about it. You can't really hear anyone talking about it - it's just embedded into the community now."</p>

        <b>"IT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE"</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the end of the school day, parents, grandparents and babysitters sit in an orderly line of cars, waiting to retrieve their young charges.</p>
      <p>David Bishop, who is picking up his granddaughter, says the armed response team at Sidney High is fine with him.</p>
      <p>"My granddaughter, she knows how to handle a gun," he says.</p>
      <p>"Her brother and dad have guns, her mother too. She's too young yet, but they have taught her how to respect a gun and how to use it if needed."</p>
      <p>High school senior Tom, who is 18 and asked that his last name not be revealed, said students hardly talk about the "program" in their free time.</p>
      <p>"We all know the weapons are there, but it doesn't really concern us. I know they are locked up in a safe - the kids can't get them," he says.</p>
      <p>The young man casually says he has faith in the teachers to protect him.</p>
      <p>"I like the idea. It makes me feel safe because I know they are specially trained if an intruder comes in and they are able to stop him," Tom explains.</p>
      <p>Before being invited to join the program, teachers are vetted in "serious interviews" and their criminal records are checked, Lenhart says.</p>
      <p>After an initial 20 hours of training given by police, teachers go through refresher courses once a month.</p>
      <p>"I'm very confident that our schools are some of the safest in the nation," Lenhart says.</p>
      <p>The teacher who is part of the response team says he believes the vetting process is airtight, so the team can be trusted.</p>
      <p>As an example, he explains that a few years ago, two teachers on staff were going through a divorce.</p>
      <p>The male teacher was immediately removed from the "program" and his access to the safes revoked while his personal life was in turmoil.</p>
