      <p>German prosecutors said Tuesday they have filed embezzlement charges against four <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/volkswagen">Volkswagen </a>executives for having accorded excessive salaries and bonuses to several members of an employees' council.</p>
      <p>The action benefitting five members of the works council cost the car giant around 5.1 million euros ($5.6 million) in overpayments, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>Of the sum, the chairman of the council alone received 3.1 million euros in excessive pay or bonuses.</p>
      <p>The four accused were not named, but two were described as former board members. The third is an ex-executive and the fourth a "current leading manager".</p>
      <p>The case is the latest in a series of legal entanglements that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/volkswagen">Volkswagen </a>is grappling with.</p>
      <p>After it admitted four years ago to illegally fitting 11 million vehicles worldwide with software to make the cars seem less polluting, the German car giant has found itself battling a series of lawsuits.</p>
      <p>Its top executives -- past and present -- have been charged with "market manipulation", while shareholders have launched a massive joint lawsuit seeking nine billion euros of damages.</p>
      <p>Some 400,000 drivers' cases have also been bundled into a mammoth trial that began on September 30.<br/>Â </p>
