      <h1>TI’s daughter unfollows him on social media after virginity testing comments</h1>
      <h2>Deyjah Harris has made her feelings known through the power of social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:26:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">Joanna Whitehead</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ti-0">TI</a>’s daughter Deyjah Harris has unfollowed him on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a> following claims he regularly escorts her to the doctor to check if her <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/womens-health">hymen</a> is still intact. </p>
      <p>The rapper’s controversial comments <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ti-daughter-hymen-virgin-planned-parenthood-gynaecologist-a9188801.html">were widely condemned</a> after he divulged intimate details about his daughter’s virginity and insistence upon the annual inspections on the Ladies Like Us podcast.</p>
      <p>Although eighteen-year-old Deyjah has not publicly addressed her father’s<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ti-daughter-hymen-virgin-gynaecologist-deyjah-harris-a9188396.html"> problematic comments</a>, she made her feelings known on social media where she unfollowed his Instagram account.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old actor left listeners aghast after disclosing highly personal information about Deyjah. </p>
      <p>During the interview, which aired last week, TI was asked if he’s had the “sex talk” with his daughter, who is currently in her first year of college. </p>
      <p>“Not only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen,” the rapper said.</p>

      <p>“So we’ll go and sit down and the doctor will come and talk and you know, the doctor will maintain a high level of professionalism,” TI continued. </p>
      <p>“And he’s like: ‘Well, you know sir, in order for me to share information... and I say: ‘Deyjah they want you to sign this. They want you to sign this. So we can share information. Is there anything that you would not want me to know? See Doc, no problem.’” </p>
      <p>The so-called virginity test has been debunked and renounced by medical professionals.</p>
      <p>Hymens can break for many reasons, including exercise, not just through penetrative sex alone.</p>
      <p>Despite being informed of this, TI was resolute, stating: “Look doc, she don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bike, she don’t play no sports. Just check the hymen please and give me back my results expeditiously”.</p>
      <p>Planned Parenthood, the US reproductive health care organisation, has denounced TI’s controlling actions. </p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter, the respected healthcare provider wrote: “Idk who needs to hear this but virginity is a made-up social construct, and it has absolutely nothing to do with your hymen.</p>
      <p>“A virgin is someone who’s never had sex. But “sex” means different things to different people, so “virginity” does too. Many don't care what it means or think it matters. Whatever you believe, the fact is you can’t tell if someone’s had sex by checking their hymen,” it read.</p>
