      <h2>Rovers can beat the Pilgrims to qualification for the last 32 of the competition</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle will learn their fate in the Leasing.com Trophy when the final game in their group is played on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> are currently second in Southern Group B, behind Chelsea Under-21s who have already secured a spot in the last 32 of the competition.</p>
      <p>However, Argyle can be overtaken in the table by Graham Coughlan Bristol Rovers, which would see them miss out on qualification for the knockout stage.</p>
      <p>Rovers will play the last game of the group against Swindon Town at the Memorial Stadium.</p>
      <p>They know a win, or a penalty shoot-out success following a draw after 90 minutes, would see them advance in the competition, at the expense of Argyle.</p>
      <p>However, a penalty shoot-out loss or a defeat to Swindon, who have been beaten in their previous two Trophy ties, would see Rovers finish third in the group.</p>
      <p>Argyle would then progress to the last 32 as runners-up to Chelsea Under-21s and be drawn against one of the seven other group winners from the southern section.</p>
      <p>The second round draw is set to take place on Saturday at 2pm, live on the Sky Sports Soccer Saturday show.</p>
      <p>Argyle missed out on a chance to guarantee their qualification when they lost 1-0 to Chelsea Under-21s at Home Park on October 29.</p>

      <p>Chelsea U21s 3-2-0-0-1 5-4 6</p>
