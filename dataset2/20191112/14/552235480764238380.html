      <p>Police are trying to reunite a veteran with his beret after it was found at Paisley bus stop on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>The black British Army cap and leather gloves were found near the Shell garage in the town's Barrhead Road.</p>
      <p>A member of the public handed the items in to Paisley Mill Street police office following the town's poignant Remembrance parade.</p>
      <p>Inspector Tracy Harkins, from Paisley's community policing team, said: "The beret will have very significant meaning to its owner so we are very keen to make sure it is returned.</p>
      <p>"If it yours please call police on 101 or attend Paisley Mill Street Station.</p>
      <p>"Please do not be offended if we ask you to provide proof that the beret belongs to you. We simply want to make sure it is returned to its rightful owner." </p>
