      <p><b>Deals</b> by Will Judd, Senior Staff Writer, Digital Foundry Updated on 12 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> We've added the latest deals from the sale, which ends at midnight tonight!</p>
      <p>Amazon has added new products to its Hidden Gems sale, with deep discounts on tech products like 4K TVs, PC peripherals, XLR microphones and much more. The sale started on Friday and runs until Tuesday, November 12th, with some items remaining on sale for the duration and others coming and going in Amazon's traditional Lightning Deals.</p>
      <p>There's a lot to wade through here, so we've done the heavy lifting to find the best products offered in the sale - including significant price drops on some of our favourite products like OLED TVs and mechanical keyboards. Here are the highlights from Day 4!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>SanDisk Micro SD cards and USB drives</h3>
      <p>SanDisk are probably the most trusted maker of flash memory in the business, so any reductions on their latest tech is worth covering. The highlight here is the 400GB Micro SD card, which is a speedy model rated for A1 speeds - so fast that you can run apps or games from it without the usual slowdowns you'd expect. Of course, that also means that file transfer speeds are also rapid, making this a great choice for drones, action cameras and the Nintendo Switch.</p>
      <p>Also included in the sale is a massive 1TB Micro SD card - the biggest capacity yet made - and a pair of USB drives, one designed to be used with iPhones and iPads and the other for PCs.</p>

      <h3>Samsung LC27JG52QQUXEN: an excellent curved gaming monitor with a very silly name</h3>
      <p>This curved VA monitor from Samsung is a nice choice for gaming, thanks to its 2560x1440 resolution and 144Hz refresh rate. That's the current sweet spot for PC gaming, offering you the chance for a more responsive experience in older and current esports titles, plus a higher resolution that you'll appreciate in slower-paced games. The subtle curve to this monitor allows it to fill your peripheral vision better, and is otherwise unnoticeable. At a deal price of £240, this is the cheapest this monitor has been all year.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Asus gaming monitors: high-res and high-refresh</h3>
      <p>Asus' gaming monitors are top-notch, and some of their greatest hits are on sale today. The VG248QE is a classic 1080p 144Hz gaming monitor, and it's reached a new low price today at £165. Even cheaper is the VP228HE, a 21.5-inch 1080p gaming monitor that's perfect for the base consoles and entry-level PCs.</p>
      <p>The ROG Swift PG279Q is another favourite, this time for offering that winning combination of a 165Hz refresh rate and 2560x1440 resolution. The most bonkers monitor on the list is the XG49VQ, a massive double-wide curved monitor that provides an insanely immersive gaming experience at 3840x1440 resolution and up to 144Hz.</p>
      <p>We've highlighted four of our favourites, but it's worth checking out the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/48ab5ad5?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">full range of Asus gaming monitors</a> on sale today.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Western Digital USB 3.0 External Hard Drives</h3>
      <p>These USB 3.0 hard drives are the perfect way to add extra storage to your PC, laptop, Xbox One or PS4. The drives vary in size from 6TB all the way up to 20TB, allowing an immense amount of space for backing up games, pictures, videos, documents and music. With that much storage speed on tap, you can even back up entire hard drives with the included software. With reductions of up to 47 per cent, this is a good time to buy.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>ASUS gaming accessories</h3>
      <p>Asus are discounting <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/6b96a2e7?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">a selection of their gaming peripherals</a> for the Hidden Gems sale, including their well-reviewed Delta Core headset, the "extra Control" Scope mechanical gaming keyboard and several rodents - we like the Gladius II Core and Gladius 2 Origin gaming mice. At around 30 per cent off for most items, this is a good chance to upgrade your setup - particularly if you're already rocking Asus PC components and want a synchronised RGB experience.</p>

      <h3>The best 4K TV for HDR gaming: LG B9 OLED</h3>
      <p>This 2019 OLED TV from LG is our absolute favourite 4K TV on the market right now. Its advanced OLED screen means gorgeous colour reproduction, wide viewing angles, perfectly dark blacks and strong motion handling thanks to nearly instantaneous pixel response times. The B9's input lag is also extremely low at 14ms, making it better than most TVs and as good as some monitors for fast-paced games.</p>
      <p>The inclusion of four HDMI 2.1 ports means that this TV is also much more future-proof than even the B8 and C8 from last year. HDMI 2.1 is expected to be used in next-generation consoles and graphics cards, allowing 4K at 120Hz over a single cable. However, like other OLED models, screen burn-in is a possibility for static content and brightness isn't as high as Samsung's QLEDs. Regardless, we still think this TV is the best option for films and gaming for most people.</p>

          <b>For a cheaper alternative, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07RWNWP2B?tag=eurgam-df-uk-21">Philips Ambilight 55-inch OLED</a>, which has been reduced from £1499 to £1099 today. This TV uses the same OLED panel as the LG TV, with support for Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and HDR 10+. Alexa and an ambient light are built in.</b>

      <h3>The best cheap 4K HDR TV: Hisense B7100 50-inch</h3>
      <p>If you want the most TV for the least money, this 50-inch Hisense B7100 is the perfect choice. The TV uses a VA panel, so contrast is good but viewing angles and colour accuracy won't match that of an OLED - not that you would ever see an OLED at this kind of price! In terms of HDR support, HDR10 and the BBC's favoured Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) formats are both supported, but more expensive propositions like DolbyVision and HDR10+ are missing. Input lag is also only average, at around 50ms, making the TV best suited to slower games and video. Still, it's hard to argue with this much 4K TV for such a low price.</p>

      <h3>Microsoft Surface Go, Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2</h3>

      <p>Coincidentally, Microsoft are also having a sale today! The highlights include deep discounts on various Surface products, thanks to the recent release of new versions. That makes it the best time to pick up a bargain on last year's hardware, including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-go/8v9dp4lnknsz">up to £56 off the Surface Go</a>, up to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-6/8zcnc665slq5">£460 off the Surface Pro 6</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-laptop-2/8xqjkk3dd91b">up to £534 off the Surface Laptop 2</a>.</p>
      <p>All three Surfaces remain excellent products in their own right, particularly the Surface Pro 6 and Laptop 2. For these, we recommend configurations with 256GB of storage, 8GB of memory and a Core i5 - higher capacities are significantly more expensive and mostly come in handy for more intensive tasks like professional photo editing, so it's better to opt for a lower-spec version at a lower price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <i>Remember that the sale ends tonight at midnight, so if there's anything you're interested in it's best to pick it up now! Of course, you'll also have a chance to grab discounted electronics during Black Friday week at the end of the month, so stay tuned for Digital Foundry coverage of that too!</i>
