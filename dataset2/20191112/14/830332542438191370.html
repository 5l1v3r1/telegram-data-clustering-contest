      <p>The state Assembly is set to pass a bill that would define autocycles in state law and establish registration fees for the vehicles.</p>
      <p>Autocycles are three-wheeled vehicles that can seat one or two people. Some have roofs. Others are open-air.</p>
      <p>The Republican-authored bill would define an autocycle as a vehicle with three wheels in contact with the ground, seating that doesn't require operators or occupants to straddle it and a steering wheel. The bill would establish a $45 annual autocycle registration fee and allow anyone with a regular driver's license to operate one.</p>
      <p>The Assembly is expected to vote on the bill Tuesday. The Senate passed the measure in October. Assembly approval would send the bill to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.</p>
