      <h1>Ricky Gervais Returning to Host the 2020 Golden Globes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:11:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Megh Wright</a></address>
      <p>During a time when <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/emmy-awards-2019-no-host.html">some awards shows are opting to go hostless</a>, one ceremony is instead doubling down with a former host that has a track record of not holding back when it comes to mocking Hollywood. NBC announced this morning that comedian <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/ricky-gervais-humanity-netflix-review.html">Ricky Gervais</a> is returning to his former gig as Golden Globes host next year. Gervais has signed on to host the awards ceremony for a fifth time, following a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2010/01/ricky_gervais_saves_the_golden.html">three-year run</a> from 2010 to 2013 and his most recent hosting gig in 2016. The three-hour ceremony is set to air live starting at 8 p.m. on Sunday, January 5, on NBC.</p>
      <p>“Once again, they’ve made me an offer I can’t refuse,” Gervais said on the news. “But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening.” Gervais, for the record, has <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2012/01/ricky-gervais-golden-globes-blog-again.html">vowed to never host the Globes again before</a>, only to return to do it again — so take that quote with a giant grain of salt.</p>
      <p>Following Gervais’s three-year Globes-hosting stint in 2010 to 2013, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/10/amy-poehler-and-tina-fey-last-golden-globes.html">Tina Fey and Amy Poehler</a> took over hosting duties from 2013 to 2015. Following Gervais’s return in 2016, late-night hosts <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/08/jimmy-fallon-set-to-host-2017-golden-globes.html">Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/seth-meyers-is-reportedly-your-2018-golden-globes-host.html">Seth Meyers</a> hosted the ceremony in 2017 and 2018, respectively, followed by last year’s hosting duo <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/andy-samberg-sandra-oh-host-golden-globes.html">Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh</a>.</p>
