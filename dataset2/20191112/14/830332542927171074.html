      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Most Wisconsin schools and districts are meeting expectations based on newly released data.</p>
      <p>The Department of Public Instruction on Tuesday released school report cards for all public and private choice schools in the state. The report cards in their fourth year are designed to be used by people living in the districts to hold schools accountable for their performance and growth, or reduction in scores, from year to year.</p>
      <p>Eighty-seven percent of schools met or exceeded expectations. That is up from 84% last year.</p>
      <p>Nearly all school districts, 97%, met or exceeded expectations. That is up from 96% last year.</p>
      <p>The Mercer School District in northern Wisconsin was the only one with the lowest one-star rating meaning it failed to meet expectations. Fifty-three schools got one star. Seventeen districts and 210 schools received the second-lowest, two-star rating meaning they met few expectations.</p>
