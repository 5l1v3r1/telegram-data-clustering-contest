        <b>Recovering from a hamstring injury and a side strain, pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar was seen participating in a "skill session" during team India's practice ahead of the series-opener against Bangladesh. It seems that the team management has taken over for the final phase of Bhuvi’s rehab from the NCA.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the negative publicity that has surrounded the rehabilitation setup at the NCA, it is understandable that the backroom staff brought Bhuvneshwar back into the mix. Since his return from the tour of West Indies, Bhuvneshwar had been following a rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has a catching session with fielding coach R Sridhar before participating briefly in the nets session, but evidently not at full tilt.</p>
      <p>"Bhuvi is here for a skill session with the team. The team management just wants him to get into the groove," a team source told PTI.</p>
      <p>However, Bhuvneshwar's presence at the session is welcome news for India, as far as white-ball cricket is concerned. A fit Bhuvi is a necessity given that it is still early days for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/khaleel">Khaleel</a> Ahmed and managing the workload of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/jasprit_bumrah">Jasprit Bumrah</a> is a top priority for the management. Although there was no official confirmation on the matter, it is understood that physio Nitin Patel and trainer Nick Webb will have a bigger role to play in the near future as far as his return to full fitness is concerned.</p>
