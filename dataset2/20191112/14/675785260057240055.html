      <h1>Katie Price 'refusing to divorce Kieran Hayler to spite his girlfriend' after restraining order</h1>
      <h2>In June Katie, 41, was handed a restraining order after she branded Michelle a 'f***ing c***' outside a primary school</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:07:25+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price is reportedly refusing to divorce her ex husband Kieran Hayler to spite his new girlfriend Michelle Pentecost.</p>
      <p>In June the former glamour model, 41, was handed a restraining order to stay away from Michelle after she branded her a "f***ing c***" outside a primary school.</p>
      <p>Now The Sun reports that Katie will not move forward with her divorce from Kieran in order to "keep control", despite being with Kris Boyson.</p>
      <p>The former couple got married in January 2013 but split last year after she accused him of cheating on her multiple times.</p>
      <p>It's thought that Kieran is keen to propose to Michelle and wants to get the divorce finalised as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Katie's reps for comment.</p>
      <p>Kieran sparked rumours that Michelle is pregnant after he rubbed her stomach during a night out last week.</p>
      <p>He'd treated Michelle to a birthday pampering session, whisking her out for a romantic meal after they'd shared a pub lunch with her son and his two kids, Jett and Bunny.</p>

      <p>And he even surprised her by dressing up as a police officer - complete with bullet-proof vest and aviator sunglasses - to reprise his old stripping act.</p>
      <p>Michelle and Kieran first got together in summer 2018, after meeting at the gates of the primary school their children all go to.</p>
      <p>It came after Kieran and Katie split, following his affair with their children's nanny.</p>

      <p>While they're yet to officially divorce, their post-split relationship has been marred by Katie's animosity towards Michelle.</p>
      <p>She was banned from contacting Kieran's new love and another school mum after being convicted of using threatening language or behaviour towards them outside the school.</p>
      <p>And Kieran recently branded his estranged wife a "disgrace" and hinted he would go for full custody of Jett and Bunny in the wake of Katie's wild summer of partying, which culminated in her dumping toyboy Kris Boyson for builder Charles Drury before taking Kris back once again.</p>
