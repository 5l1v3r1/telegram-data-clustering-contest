      <p>A nearby neighbour to paedo brothers William and Christopher Kennedy has told the News how their family home was “mayhem”.</p>
      <p>The disgusting pair have this year both been convicted of sending vile messages and lurid sexual images to someone they believed to be a 14-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Elder brother William, 36, was also convicted of trying to meet up with a child for sex.</p>

      <p>The sick brothers practised their sick predilections at their mother’s house on Mount Cameron Drive North, a previously quiet residential area.</p>
      <p>But one neighbour – who has asked not to be named – said police presence, noise, disruption and fights became commonplace once they moved into the area.</p>

      <p>He said: “Until they moved here, you never saw the police at all – it’s a completely different area now.</p>
      <p>“When they moved in it became a regular occurrence. And it’s just that one house, just that one family who caused the problems.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a family orientated area as well. But mum’s actually hurry their kids past the house and point at it and say, ‘that’s the bad men’s house, you don’t go near that house’.</p>
      <p>“You can hear on William’s sting video folk in the background saying, ‘he was asking kids from the street to come in and watch Sky TV’.”</p>
      <p>And our source was quick to pin the blame on the pair’s mother, Evelyn Kennedy, who tried to defend her sons throughout, standing by both at numerous court appearances.</p>

      <p>When the News spoke with the mother of the beasts this week, she said “no comment – I’m not saying anything”.</p>
      <p>In their online sting videos, Evelyn can be heard defending her sons, saying about William that he “hasn’t done anythng wrong”.</p>
      <p>She can be heard saying: “He’s disabled, he’s got an alcohol problem. I heard him talking to a wee girl and I told him not to do it again.”</p>
      <p>Calling them “a problem family for sure,” our source said complaints about the three-bedroom family house were almost daily, with police turning up ‘mob-handed’ to deal with parties that would spill out onto the streets.</p>
      <p>He said the “mum was just as bad,” recalling times where she would “be there trying to stop cops from going into the house”.</p>
      <p>The resident added: “It was mayhem and would usually spill out into the street. To be honest, they were complete space cadets.</p>
      <p>“They moved in in 2013 and the mother obviously just didn’t give a monkey’s.</p>
      <p>“At first it was the mum and her kids, then her boyfriend moved in. It was never that bad when he was there. But when he moved out it got totally ridiculous.</p>
      <p>“Evelyn just let them do what they wanted. Christopher acted like a kid and I don’t think he’s the full shilling. William seemed perfectly normal to be honest, but he was a bit of a bevvy merchant.</p>
      <p>“I hardly recognised him when I saw him the other day – he’s aged ten years in 12 months. Well you would with all that going on.”</p>
