      <h1>Abra Adding 60 New Cryptocurrencies in Consumer Adoption Push: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:42:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>California-based cryptocurrency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/wallet">wallet</a> and investment service <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/abra">Abra</a> is adding a total of 60 new <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a> to its platform, reports suggest.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/investment-app-abra-expands-us-offerings-with-60-new-cryptos">CoinDesk</a> on Nov. 12, the increasingly widespread payment gateway is planning to more than treble its existing crypto offerings for international users from 30 to 90 tokens.</p>
      <h3>Four stablecoins to debut on Abra platform</h3>
      <p>Four stablecoins including Tether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tether">USDT</a>), Paxos Standard (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/paxos">PAX</a>), TrueUSD (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/trueusd">TUSD</a>) and Dai (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/dai-dai">DAI</a>) will reportedly be among the new tokens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/abra-restricts-americans-from-holding-eos-and-4-other-altcoins">Restrictions remain</a> for United States residents, who are unable to hold Qtum (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/qtum-qtum">QTUM</a>), Bitcoin Gold (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-gold">BTG</a>), EOS (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index">EOS</a>), OmiseGo (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/omisego">OMG</a>) and Status (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/status">SNT</a>) on Abra’s platform.</p>
      <p>New York residents can only hold Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>) and Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>) on Abra. The restrictions all relate to local regulatory hurdles.</p>
      <p>Cointelegraph has reached out to both Abra and its CEO, Bill Barhydt, for more details, but has not received a response as of press time.</p>
      <h3>Institutions take the lead</h3>
      <p>Abra focuses on the slowly-expanding consumer adoption curve for cryptocurrency, at a time when attention continues to focus on the institutional sector as fresh offerings come online.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-rolls-out-critical-bitcoin-custody-after-ny-gives-green-light">reported</a>, institutional trading platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> released its Bitcoin custody solution this week, something it considered a critical step to broader adoption.</p>
      <p>The sentiment was previously <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-novogratzs-galaxy-firm-is-launching-new-bitcoin-funds">echoed</a> by Bitcoin proponent and venture capital investor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/michael-novogratz">Mike Novogratz</a>.</p>
      <p>“Bakkt just got set up, there’s a futures exchange that’s starting to gain some volume. But more importantly they’ve got a custody solution that’s just coming online… world-class custody which allows more and more people to feel comfortable with it,” he said in an interview late last month.</p>
