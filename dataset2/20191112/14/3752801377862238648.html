      <p>Authorities are at the scene.</p>
      <p>"The R60 is closed in both directions. Officers are redirecting traffic from Ashton side via Drew on the R317 through Stormsvlei to the N2," Africa said.</p>
      <p>"From Swellendam they are redirecting traffic - light motor vehicles only - just before the crash scene via Leeurivier back onto the R60."</p>
