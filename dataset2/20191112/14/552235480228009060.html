      <h1>East Kilbride kids could face delay over free flu vaccination</h1>
      <h2>That’s because the company have had to repeat testing on some batches of the vaccine.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:47:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Children across South Lanarkshire may not get their flu vaccination before winter because of a shipment delay from the manufacturers.</p>
      <p>Vaccination is a simple nasal spray, but the inoculations developed by Astrazeneca – due to arrive later this month – could be delayed.</p>
      <p>That’s because the company have had to repeat testing on some batches of the vaccine.</p>
      <p>Now NHS Lanarkshire’s public health medicine consultant has urged parents to make sure appointments for the spray have been organised for their kids.</p>
      <p>Dr David Cromie said: “Parents and carers of two-to-five-year-olds will have received a letter by now asking them to book an appointment through a central phone number.</p>
      <p>“I’d urge them to arrange this as soon as possible to ensure their children are protected against influenza, which can be an unpredictable and serious disease.”</p>

      <p>The South Lanarkshire vaccination programme at primary schools is expected to continue as normal, however, vaccinations could be rescheduled if delays are incurred.</p>
      <p>The supply issue does not impact vaccinations for adults who are eligible for the flu jab, which includes those with breathing problems, diabetes, heart and kidney conditions, those over 65-years old and pregnant women.</p>
      <p>The medication is procured by Public Health England before being transported to Scotland and the Scottish government is looking at ways to mitigate any problems with potential delays.</p>

      <p>They have said that the testing is nothing to do with the effectiveness or safety of the vaccine.</p>
      <p>Dr Cromie said: “I realise some people are still hesitant about the safety of immunisations.</p>
      <p>“I wish to emphasise the facts show influenza vaccination is safe and if you or your child are not protected, you could become very unwell and indeed spread it on to your family and friends.</p>
      <p>“Getting vaccinated is a quick and easy step to protect your and your family’s health.”</p>
      <p>The vaccination programme is expected to eventually prevent an estimated 200 deaths and 1100 hospitalisations a year.</p>
