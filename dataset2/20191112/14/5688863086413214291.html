        <b>Ajinkya Rahane is confident that India side will not have any problems adapting to the pink ball when they play their first-ever day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens from November 22. Much like the others, Rahane agrees that Test cricket under lights will be exciting for the fans.</b>

      <p>As India gears towards a historic step in their cricketing journey in the longest format of the game, the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> shared a video on Twitter in which senior batsmen Rahane and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/cheteshwar_pujara">Cheteshwar </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pujara">Pujara</a> were seen talking about the challenges that await the Indian team.</p>
      <p>"I am very excited as it is a new challenge. When we play the match, we will get the idea then. When we have practice sessions before the match, then only we can assess how pink ball behaves. From the fan point of view, it would be really exciting. As a batsman, playing late would be the key. Pink ball swings late and it would be essential in playing the ball late. I do not think there would be any problems in adapting," Rahane said, reported ANI.</p>
      <p>Pujara, who has previously played with the pink ball during a <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/duleep_trophy">Duleep Trophy</a> match, also expressed his excitement at the fixture, while further pointing out the things batsmen need to look out for.</p>
      <p>"Day-night would be really interesting. Earlier, I played in the Duleep Trophy with the pink ball and it was interesting to play with that ball. Now we will play the international day-night Test. Yes, it will be exciting," Pujara said.</p>
      <p>"During the day, there would be no concerns regarding the visibility of the pink ball. In my opinion, the twilight period would be really challenging as to how one sights the ball. When I talked to other players, they told me picking the ball out of wrist spinners was a challenge," he added.</p>
      <p>The decision to play the second of the two-match series under light was announced on October 29, after newly-elected BCCI president <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sourav_ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> managed to persuade skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a> and the Bangladesh board. </p>
      <p>"I had met Virat on October 25th for an hour and my first question was, we need to have day-night Test cricket and the answer in three seconds was let's go ahead and do it. I found him absolutely acceptable to play day-night Test matches,” Ganguly said</p>
