      <h1>Help us help those less well-off in greater East Kilbride this Christmas</h1>
      <h2>The EK News launches our festive appeal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:56:18+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is a time of celebration. A time for loving, caring, sharing and enjoying special moments with friends and family.</p>
      <p>Yet for some, it can be a difficult time filled with anxiety, when their financial constraints are tested to the limit.</p>
      <p>While the majority of families across the greater East Kilbride area can enjoy the decadence of the festive period, there are thousands who will go without.</p>

      <p>There are many in the area who can only dream of Christmas stockings overflowing with toys and selection boxes, extravagantly flavoured take-away coffees, a well-stocked fridge and a luxurious dinner table.</p>
      <p>So, the East Kilbride News is teaming up with EK, East Kilbride and Sainsbury’s to launch our ‘reverse Advent calendar’ in support of a lifeline charity.</p>
      <p>Instead of receiving 24 treats on the countdown to Christmas, families, schools and businesses are asked to place 24 FOOD or NEW TOY items in a box or bag and donate them to Loaves and Fishes Foodbank.</p>

      <p>That means those dependent on the charity can enjoy Christmas that little bit more, with Loaves and Fishes offering up food parcels and toys for those in need this Christmas.</p>
      <p>The foodbank is supported by local churches and community groups, who work together towards stopping hunger in the area.</p>
      <p>If strictly adhering to the reverse advent calendar idea, readers should start to assemble their boxes from Wednesday, November 20 and submit them at EK East Kilbride by Friday, December 13.</p>
      <p>Toy donations can be made to the Customer Service desk at EK, East Kilbride, and food donations made to Sainsbury’s in the Olympia Centre.</p>
