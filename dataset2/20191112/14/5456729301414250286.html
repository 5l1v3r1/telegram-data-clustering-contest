      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:17:47+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/world-foreign/362472-indian-court-orders-rape-victim-to-sell-baby.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>A 16-year-old girl, who gave birth to a child, after allegedly being raped by two men was ordered by Panchayat (a formalised local self-governance system) to sell the baby and keep the money as compensation.</p>
      <p>Panchayat is a self-governance system with powers of adjudication and comprising elected elders of the village.</p>
      <p>According to a Bihar police official linked to the case, the victim who hails from a village in Muzaffarpur approached them a few days ago.</p>
      <p>The police said the girl alleged that a Muslim cleric that resided in the village mosque raped her in an unconscious state and recorded the act.</p>
      <p>“After the incident, the cleric kept raping her over two months and threatened her with consequences if she revealed the incidents to anyone.</p>
      <p>“During this time she became pregnant, which she revealed to a young man from the village.</p>
      <p>“He then raped her on the pretext of marriage but didn’t marry her,” the officer said.</p>
      <p>In her complaint, she also said that she had visited her maternal uncle’s house, and when the family learned about her pregnancy, she told them about her ordeal.</p>
      <p>The family members approached the Panchayat seeking justice but were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>The police said that in October, she gave birth to a child, but the Panchayat labelled the incident a misfortune and ordered the victim to sell the child and keep the money as compensation.</p>
      <p>The family finally approached a local police station and registered a case.</p>
      <p>The police confirmed that several teams have been formed to arrest the absconding accused.</p>
      <p>“We are checking on the claims made by the victim and the verdict of the panchayat.</p>
      <p>“A DNA test is also being conducted to identify the biological father of the newborn.’’</p>
