      <h3>Neymar remains optimistic on potentially returning to Barcelona.</h3>
      <p>Neymar was in Barcelona over the weekend which once again sparked rumors of a potential return.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191112/471537548995/neymar-no-olvida-su-idea-de-volver-al-barcelona.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a>, the current PSG player has mentioned his desire for a return twice in the last couple of months.</p>
      <p>He first mentioned it back towards the end of September when the Brazilian was in Barcelona dealing with the lawsuit involving his former club. The second time was this past weekend when he was pictured partying alongside Arthur Melo.</p>
      <p>The saga involving Neymar, Bar√ßa, and PSG is well-documented after the player made almost every gesture possible to let PSG know that he wanted out.</p>
      <p>The Catalans made an attempt to bring him back but they could not reach an agreement with PSG. Players, cash, and a possible loan were options put on the table but none were satisfactory to PSG.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, speculations and confirmations have popped up from players close to Neymar.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi claimed that he wanted him back at the club but was ultimately unsure how hard the club negotiated in an effort to bring him back.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/pique-neymar-barcelona-psg-financial-fair-play-contract-salary-transfer-a9178721.html"><b>Gerard Pique</b></a> revealed that the players were so desperate to see Neymar back that they were willing to cut their own salaries if it would help the club with regards to Financial Fair Play rules.</p>
      <p>The efforts by the players proved futile as Barcelona were not in a financial position to agree to what PSG were looking for.</p>
      <p>Neymar has made no secret that he still wants a return. To his credit, he seems to be focused and playing well for PSG despite the bickering between him and his current club.</p>
      <p>Neymar is working his way back from an injury he suffered during the last international break. His goal is to return in time for the match against Lille and be ready in time for their Champions League clash against Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>He hopes to play well against Real Madrid with the <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191112/471537869051/neymar-objetivo-bernabeu-con-motivacion-azulgrana.html"><b>added motivation</b></a> of impressing his former side.</p>
      <p>While a return in the winter seems unlikely, all signs point to another transfer saga with Neymar right in the middle of it.</p>
