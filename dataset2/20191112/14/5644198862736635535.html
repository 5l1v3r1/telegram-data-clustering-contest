      <p>Osram urged shareholders to back a US$5 billion takeover bid from Austria's AMS and said it would cut costs and not pay a dividend as it posted a loss for the fiscal year ending in September, hit by a downturn in the auto industry.</p>
      <p>FRANKFURT: Osram urged shareholders to back a US$5 billion takeover bid from Austria's AMS and said it would cut costs and not pay a dividend as it posted a loss for the fiscal year ending in September, hit by a downturn in the auto industry.</p>
      <p>"The offer price of 41 euros per share in cash represents an appropriate valuation of the company from the point of view of the boards," the company said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Shareholders have until December 5, 2019 to accept the offer, Osram said.</p>
      <p>In the fiscal year ended in September Osram posted a 343 million euros (US$377.99 million) net loss, down from a 188 million euros profit in the year-earlier period.</p>
      <p>"Osram does not expect global automobile production to recover in the short term," the company said, adding that employees at German locations are protected from merger-related layoffs until the end of 2022.</p>
      <p>AMS renewed its takeover attempt of Osram earlier this month, hoping its latest offer would convince investors with a lower acceptance rate and concessions to the German lighting group's management and trade unions.</p>
