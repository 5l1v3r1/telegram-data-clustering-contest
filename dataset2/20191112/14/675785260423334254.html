      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:15:19+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Fans of the Shelby family are set to be very happy.</p>
      <p>The Birmingham-based gangster clan that are the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/peaky-blinders">Peaky Blinders</a> are due to return for new episodes in the sixth season of the BBC drama.</p>
      <p>Now it has been confirmed by <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/peaky-blinders-season-6-filming-17012923">Manchester Evening News</a> that much of the new run of episodes will be filmed in Manchester, with Space Studios being picked as a central base of production.</p>
      <p>The fifth run ended with leading man Tommy Shelby ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cillian-murphy">Cillian Murphy</a> ) holding a gun to his head surrounded by mists and haunted by his late wife Grace Shelby (Annabelle Wallis).</p>

      <p>It shall be an eventful season following Shelby's disastrous feud with fascist Sir Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin).</p>
      <p>The finale of the fifth run saw an attempt to assassinate Mosley go dangerously wrong, leaving Tommy more vulnerable than ever.</p>
      <p>Season 6 director <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/peaky-blinders-season-6-feature-20167166">Anthony Byrne previously revealed</a> that Mosley's associates will play a big role in the new season, along with Michael Gray's wife Gina (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was revealed to have powerful friends and family in the US at the conclusion of the fifth run.</p>
      <p>We wonder how the Shelby family will deal with these threats!</p>
      <p>Cillian Murphy is set to return for new episodes alongside Paul Anderson, Helen McCrory and all our other favourites.</p>
      <p>
