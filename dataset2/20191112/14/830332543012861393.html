      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The Wisconsin Assembly is scheduled to give final approval to a bill designed to help the state's industrial hemp industry as the program enters its second year.</p>
      <p>The bill up for approval Tuesday would align the state's program with new requirements under the 2018 federal farm bill, while also allowing Wisconsin to retain control.</p>
      <p>The bipartisan measure is designed to help farmers, hemp processors, retailers and consumers as the industry in Wisconsin grows.</p>
      <p>The bill comes as some lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers are pushing the Legislature to legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize small amounts of pot. There is also a bill to fully legalize recreational marijuana.</p>
      <p>Hemp and marijuana are both forms of cannabis, but hemp lacks enough of the active ingredient THC to get people high.</p>
