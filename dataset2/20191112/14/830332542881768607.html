      <h1>Several crews respond to house fire in single-digit temperatures</h1>

      <p>BRISTOL, Wis. - Multiple fire departments responded to a house fire in single-digit temperatures outside Sun Prairie Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Dane County dispatchers said firefighters were called to a home at 2354 Branch Road in Bristol just after 6:00 a.m. The fire was put out by 6:30 a.m., but crews remain on scene monitoring for possible hot spots.</p>
      <p>Their response came as the Madison area set a record low Tuesday morning. Some lows across southern Wisconsin dropped into single digits, with some areas below zero Tuesday morning.Â </p>
      <p>"Your hand don't want to move. Your equipment doesn't want to work all the way. A little extra effort has to go into play, pushing everything out," Bill Sullivan, the assistant chief of the Sun Prairie Volunteer Fire Department said when asked about the cold.</p>
      <p>Sullivan said crews take extra precautions to make sure the trucks and hoses do not freeze up during responses in the extreme cold. Extra crews are also brought in to help.</p>
      <p>"Our staff need more rehab time," Sullivan said.</p>
      <p>"That's why we will call in extra assistance, in case we need to rotate guys in more quickly than we would on a 70-degree day."</p>
      <p>No one was hurt during the fire. A pet cat was also safe.</p>
      <p>"The cat is doing well inside, he was kind of keeping an eye on us in there to make sure that we weren't doing too much in there," Sullivan said.</p>
