      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20959171/disney-plus-shows-movies-subscription-pricing-news-devices-and-more">Disney Plus</a>, Disney’s new streaming service, is currently experiencing <i>very</i> slow loading speeds, to the point where the content is basically unavailable. I’ve waited 30 minutes (and counting) to begin <i>Dumbo</i>. Other Polygon staff members have waited similar amounts of time to load <i>The Mandalorian</i>. So, whether you want to check out the latest Star Wars show, or just watch Forky embrace his inner trash, you may have to wait a little — or a lot.</p>
      <p>Disney hasn’t officially explained why its brand-new service is, for many users, chugging at a glacial pace. But the debut of <i>The Mandalorian, </i>combined with interest in the company’s sprawling back catalog, have seemingly clogged up the platform. While the delays are annoying, the excitement of launch day regularly slows — if not outright crashes — servers, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/15/18226240/anthem-servers-down-pc-xbox-one">most commonly</a> in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/26/20833767/world-of-warcraft-classic-queue-time-log-in-servers">world</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/1/20894101/destiny-2-shadowkeep-new-light-down-error-server-capacity-queue-maintenance-emergency">multiplayer video games</a>.</p>

      <p>People across Twitter are <a href="https://twitter.com/mjv_2000/status/1194246582843170816">reporting frustrating loading times</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/lovekmxo/status/1194242420789141509"> ranging from the content itself lagging</a> to the user being <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_Shneinhood/status/1194250117869649920">unable to connect at all. </a>Others are <a href="https://twitter.com/BloomKc/status/1194255188959416320">reporting error 76</a>, which points to “slow internet connection speeds” as the source of the problem.</p>
      <p>When the platform launched in the wee hours of the morning on Tuesday, the site worked pretty well. But as more and more users logged on, it appears that the Disney back end has been swamped. We don’t see many new streaming sites pop up to as much fervor, so there’s little precedent in the world of video streaming. Oddly enough, the closest comparison may be <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2Fgeneral%2F2014%2F02%2F25%2Fwwe-network-experiences-launch-problems.aspx&amp;referrer=polygon.com">the launch of the pro wrestling streaming service the WWE Network in 2014, which had its own set of problems.</a></p>

      <p>Disney Plus was built in conjunction with BAMTech, the streaming technology provider behind services like HBO Now and ESPN Plus. Disney bought a majority stake in the company back in 2017, in large part to use its streaming expertise on Disney Plus. According to an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20831284/disney-plus-overload-crash-hbo-now-espn-launch-day">interview with The Verge</a>, the possibility of launch-day problems is something the team has been thinking about for some time. Michael Paull, president of Disney’s streaming services and former BAMTech CEO, was confident that his unit had enough experience to ensure a smooth launch.</p>
      <p>“Fortunately, we’ve had the experience with <i>Game of Thrones</i>, we’ve had the experience of ESPN Plus with the big pay-per-view events that we’re doing with UFC exclusively on our Platform,” Paull said in August. “We’re getting big bursts. We’ve built capabilities to sustain that, both in terms of processing the transactions that all come in — in a very, very short period of time — as well as the streams.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Paull and Disney, things haven’t quite gone as planned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20959302/disney-plus-how-to-subscribe-fire-tv-app-verizon-hulu-bundle">Disney Plus is available through apps</a> for smart TVs, game consoles, set-top boxes, and mobile devices, as well as computer browsers. According to users across social media, some of these options are faring better than others, but there doesn’t seem to be a <a href="https://twitter.com/dsharp524/status/1194245995237924865">trend on which device</a> or which internet service provider loads Disney Plus any faster. Disney has not said anything yet about the slow loading times.</p>
      <p>Polygon has reached out to Disney about the loading speeds and will update the story if and when it receives a response.</p>
      <p><b>Update: </b>Disney responded with a statement regarding the loading times and high user volume:</p>
      <blockquote>The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our high expectations. We are pleased by this incredible response and are working to quickly resolve the current user issue. We appreciate your patience.</blockquote>
