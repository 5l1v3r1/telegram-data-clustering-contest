      <p>The Bushbuckridge Local Municipality says the risk to water supply is a result of an illegal labour unrest by the staff members.</p>
      <p>The municipality issued a press statement notifying members of the community about the disturbance of water purification processes in some water treatment plants, including Inyaka Water Treatment Works, Hoxani and Acornhoek.</p>

      <p>In a statement they stated that, “The staff responsible for water purification and production processes in the abovementioned water treatment plants embarked on an illegal labour unrest as of Monday. The illegal labour unrest could have catastrophic effects on water production and supply to the whole of Bushbuckridge.</p>
      <p>“Hence, the municipality has put in place immediate temporary measures to ensure that water production processes and supply resumes earliest while the municipality attempts to resolve the labour impasse with the illegal striking workers.</p>

      <p>“We call upon all residents to use water sparingly. Water harvesting is one way of conserving water, so we encourage our communities to take advantage of the rain we are receiving lately. Lets store water.</p>
      <p>We will update our communities once the situation has been resolved and back to normal operations. The municipality apologises for the inconvenience the situation might have caused.”</p>
