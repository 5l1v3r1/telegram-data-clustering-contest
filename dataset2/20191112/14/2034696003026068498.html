      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/features/peaky-blinders-soundtrack-music-interviews-season-5-cillian-murphy-creators-2538130">Having penned the score to the latest season of the BBC show</a>, <i>NME </i>said “Calvi’s dramatic breaths, guitar virtuosity and cinematic soundscapes are now indelibly married to the tortured psyche of Tommy Shelby.”</p>
      <p>‘You’re Not God’ is taken <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/peaky-blinders-soundtrack-release-cd-vinyl-tracklist-2559726">from the release of the first official ‘Peaky Blinders Soundtrack’</a>, which also features Calvi’s cover of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/fka-twigs">FKA Twigs</a>’ ‘Papi Pacify.’ You can listen to the song here:</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/anna-calvi-peaky-blinders-soundtrack-interview-2550358">Speaking about writing the <i>Peaky Blinders</i> score earlier this year, Calvi told <i>NME</i>:</a> “It wasn’t difficult, it was just a lot of fun. It was incredible for it not to be about me and to really try and get into another character. When I was doing it, I really felt like I was him. I really got into the mindset of Tommy Shelby.”</p>
      <p>Calvi also revealed that she’s started work on her next album and that it has a <i>Peaky Blinders</i>-feel to it. It follows the release of her third, critically acclaimed album from 2018, ‘Hunter’.“A lot of the work I did for Peaky was me just playing around with the guitar to get some interesting soundscapes,” Calvi said. “That’s whet my appetite to do more of that.”</p>
      <p>The <i>Peaky Blinders</i> soundtrack will be released on November 15 and features artists including <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/NICK-CAVE-and-the-bad-seeds">Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds,</a> <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/pj-harvey">PJ Harvey,</a> <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/radiohead">Radiohead</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/arctic-monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-white-stripes">The White Stripes</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ROYAL-BLOOD">Royal Blood</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/THE-LAST-SHADOW-PUPPETS">The Last Shadow Puppets</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/QUEENS-OF-THE-STONE-AGE">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/black-sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/DAVID-BOWIE">David Bowie</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/LAURA-MARLING">Laura Marling</a>, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/foals">Foals.</a></p>
