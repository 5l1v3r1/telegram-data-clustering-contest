      <h1>Andy Murray admits fears new Davis Cup format will dampen atmosphere in Madrid</h1>
      <h2>The revamped tournament will see 18 nations battle it out in a World Cup-style tournament from November 18-24</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andy-murray">Andy Murray</a> fears the patriotic atmosphere at the revamped <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/davis-cup">Davis Cup</a> will be lost in Madrid next week.</p>
      <p>The double <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> champion was only 17 when he made his debut in Israel in 2005 and led <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/great-britain-davis-cup-team">Great Britain</a> to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-defeats-david-goffin-6923401">victory in Gent</a> amid raucous scenes in 2015.</p>
      <p>For the first time this year the top 18 nations will play in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fifa-world-cup">World Cup</a> -style competition in the Spanish capital with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leon-smith">Leon Smith's</a> team facing the Netherlands and Kazakhstan in the group stages.</p>
      <p>There will be then three days of knockout tennis with the final on November 23.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited and intrigued to see what it’ll be like with the new format,” said Murray.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to miss the atmosphere because I don’t think the atmosphere’s going to be the same as some of the home ties or the away ties that I played.</p>
      <p>"The atmospheres were tough but it will be what I remember when I finish playing, like the Belgian final and my first Davis Cup in Israel.</p>
      <p>"I’m going to miss that but I love being around the team and I’m excited to see what the new format looks like and I hope the atmosphere is brilliant. That’s my one concern about it.</p>
      <p>"From what I hear we’ve sold a lot of tickets and will have a decent fanbase out there. But how does that work if we get through to the quarter-finals, who has tickets for that, how many can stay? We’ll see but it’ll be interesting to see how it goes.”</p>

      <p>It has been a busy autumn for Murray as he became a father for the third time and then won his first tournament for two years in Antwerp.</p>
      <p>The Scot, 32, said he had no concerns about playing five-set matches at the Australian Open in January a year after his hip resurfacing operation.</p>
      <p>“I’m not worried from the hip’s perspective as I’ve had zero issues with it so far so I don’t anticipate that playing an extra 45 minutes or an hour will be bad for my hip,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The rest of my body how that responds, I’ll see when I’m out there.</p>
      <p>But world No.125 Murray, who played three events in China before his triumph at the European Open, said he would be playing a lighter schedule.</p>

      <p>“I think my body showed I’m going to be able to play at a high level. That’s where I need to be smart with my scheduling and the amount of tournaments that I play and being a bit at the beginning of the year be reactive.</p>
      <p>"I’m not going to be looking at my schedule and my tournament year anymore. I’m going to do it very differently.</p>
      <p>“The reason why I’m playing is because I love it and I need to remember that so if I’m 30 in the world or 70 in the world but if I’m still enjoying it and still enjoying the preparations and training and all of that stuff and I feel competitive then that would be success for me but I need to remember that.</p>

      <p>"It’s sometimes difficult when you start playing, competing and losing matches. You really want to do better. But that would be success if I could stay healthy and on the court.”</p>
      <p>Murray was speaking at Castore's King's Road today at the launch of his debut ‘Andy Murray Castore’ co-branded tennis performance and lifestyle apparel line.</p>
