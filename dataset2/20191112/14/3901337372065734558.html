      </p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was involved in an altercation with Joe Gomez during City's 3-1 loss to Liverpool in this past Sunday, a tense situation that is believed to have continued when the England players met up in camp ahead of their upcoming 2020 European Championship qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The<i> Daily Mail </i>reported that Sterling and Gomez had a heated exchange in a canteen on Monday, with <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/euro-2016/raheem-sterling-sensationally-axed-from-england-squad-after-bust-up/667284">Southgate responding by dropping the City forward for England's clash with Montenegro</a> on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Sterling has since released a statement on social media, admitting that his emotions got the better of him, but added that he and Gomez have since made up.</p>

      <p>"First and foremost, everyone knows what that game means to me!" he wrote in an Instagram Story, according to <i>GiveMeSport.</i></p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that I am not that way inclined and more to the point. Both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on.</p>
      <p>"We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me.</p>
      <p>"This is why we play this sport because of our love for it – me and @joegomez5 are good, we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing, it's done, we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>"Let's get focus on our game on Thursday."</p>
