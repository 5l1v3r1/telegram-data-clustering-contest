      <h2>A popular parenting website has shared what its staff claim are the "worst" baby names of the year and they didn't hold back their thoughts on what made their choices so bad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:27:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:27</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>When it comes to picking a name for your child it can be a bit like <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/marmite">Marmite,</a> people will either love the one you choose or absolutely hate it.</p>
      <p>We're used to seeing the 'most popular' names of the year celebrated, but what about those divisive ones that some people really dislike?</p>
      <p>Well, staff at a popular parenting website have taken matters into their own hands and created a list of what they believe are the "worst" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> names of 2019.</p>
      <p>In a post on the site <a href="https://www.parents.com/baby-names/worst-baby-names-of-2019/">Parents.com,</a> they explain what their issues are with each moniker and rank the top 10 terrible choices for boys and top 10 for girls.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They said: "These baby names for girls and boys may not be cute, sweet or elegant, but they are most definitely unique."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>They added that the names "should give you pause" as they "may carry more of a negative meaning than some well-meaning parents may realise."</p>
      <p>So which names made it onto their lists?</p>
      <p>For little girls, the team weren't keen on the popular Game of Thrones-inspired name, Khaleesi.</p>
      <p>While Emilia Clarke's fierce Mother of Dragons may have been a fan favourite, Parents.com thought there would probably be a lot of "regret going on" for anyone who had named their baby after her, in light of that "shocking Game of Thrones character turn".</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Joining Khaleesi in the top 10 worst girls names were Chardonnay (sorry wine mums), Vegas, Starlett and Pansy.</p>
      <p>They also encouraged <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parents</a> to avoid "creative spellings" such as Blaykelee.</p>
      <p>When it cames to boys names, the staff were quick to remind people that while Manson may sound quirky for your son, it will always be associated with "the crazed serial killer" whose had it as a surname.</p>
      <p>This was joined by the bizarrely spelt Xxayvier in the top 10 worst, as well as Cletus, Danger and Kingmessiah - the latter of which they thought was probably a lot for a poor little boy to live up to.</p>
