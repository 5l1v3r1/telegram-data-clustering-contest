      <h1>Jetways Airlines Plane Forced To Make Emergency Landing In Garissa After Developing Engine Problem</h1>

      <p>A cargo plane operated by local airline Jetways was on Tuesday forced to make an emergency landing at Garissa airstrip after developing engine problem mid-air.</p>
      <p>The plane with registration number 5Y-JWC was en route to Mogadishu, Somalia, from Nairobi.</p>
      <p>There were no casualties reported during the incident.</p>
      <p>Jetways Airlines is based at Wilson Airport, Nairobi. According to the information on its website, it offers services in Kenya and the greater East and Central African region.</p>
      <p>The Tuesday incident comes hours after the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCCA) suspended Silverstone Air from flying its Dash-8 planes they use for passenger flights for a period of seven days.</p>
      <p>The authority also suspended the licences for Safe Air and Adventure Aloft.</p>

      <p>This follows a series of accidents that have caused a scare in the aviation industry, forcing the regulator to begin investigations.</p>
      <p>The recent incidents have involved aircraft operated by local airlines Silverstone Air and Safarilink Aviation.</p>
      <p>In late October, a plane operated by the local carrier crash-landed after losing one of its wheels.</p>
      <p>The aircraft, a Dash 8 300, with registration number 5Y-NOP was headed to Nairobi from Lodwar when one of its tyres fell off during take-off forcing the pilot to crash-land at Eldoret International Airport in Uasin Gishu County.</p>
      <p>The incident happened just hours after another Silverstone’s aircraft hit and damaged another plane at the Wilson Aiport in Nairobi.</p>

      <p>In a separate incident in October, a plane operated by the carrier skidded off the runway and crashed shortly after take-off leaving at least nine passengers with injuries.</p>
      <p>The aircraft that was headed to Lamu crashed shortly after takeoff due to overloading and disregard to the safety regulations at the airport.</p>
      <p>Recently, this desk revealed that the Dash8 plane should not <a href="https://www.kahawatungu.com/2019/11/08/accidents-happening-wilson-airport/">operate from Wilson Airport</a>, owing to the design of the airport which is designed to serve smaller planes.</p>
      <p>A week ago, after the accidents, Silverstone Air suspended operations on three of its routes including Nairobi-Homa Bay, Nairobi-Wajir and Nairobi-Lodwar following below-par performance in the routes.</p>
