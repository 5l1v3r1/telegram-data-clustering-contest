      <blockquote>"We'll resolve the problem, don't worry," Lavrov said on Tuesday at the Paris Peace Forum, when asked how Russia is "getting ready" for the 2020 election.</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has already commented on the matter jokingly, saying that Russia's interference in the future vote, scheduled for November 2020, was "highly likely."</p>
      <p>The president added that US Special Counsel Robert Mueller's fears over Russia's alleged meddling "would be funny if it was not so sad."</p>
      <p>On 18 April, the US Special Counsel Robert Mueller <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910091076992976-intentions-remain-unclear-us-committee-publishes-report-on-russian-meddling-in-2016-elections/">presented a report on a two-year investigation</a> into the Trump campaign. In his report, he said he had found no evidence of collusion between the presidential candidate or members of his campaign with Russia – allegations that Democrats repeated following Trump’s inauguration. Moscow has consistently denied meddling in the 2016 US elections.</p>
