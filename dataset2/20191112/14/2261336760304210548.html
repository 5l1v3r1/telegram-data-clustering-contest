      <p>I watched the Nick Diaz interview, but there were no jokes to be made about it. The man put his time in the cage and has given us a lifetime of entertainment. The best one round fight ever. Most importantly, he’s been one of the most candid fighters to ever address the act of fighting as a means for survival. His cross to bear is now that fans and media have tasted his brand of honesty, they can’t get enough. If you hear anyone say the words “Cowboy Stadium,” consider walking away from the conversation, the computer, wherever. That person is addicted, to clicks, to the thrill of the Diaz allure, to the fantasy that a rebel can bring down a corporation. The Diaz brothers are a once in a lifetime (once in <i>ever) </i>treat. But we should let them exit the game on their own terms. To continually try to drag them back is a disservice to what they’ve already contributed to MMA.</p>
      <p>Take care of yourself and I’ll talk to you tomorrow.</p>
