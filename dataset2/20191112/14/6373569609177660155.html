      <h1>Plymouth City Council is heading for a £3m overspend</h1>
      <h2>The council leader has called for more funding to be made available</h2>

      <p>Plymouth City Council leader Tudor Evans wants local government funding to be part of the General Election debate.</p>
      <p>He made the plea as councillors heard this year’s budget is heading for an overspend of more than £3m.</p>
      <p>Council officers will bring forward plans for savings to try to balance the books by the end of the financial year.</p>
      <p>The forecast overspend of just under £3.5m is less than two per cent of the council’s £185.5m revenue budget.</p>
      <p>The budget figure includes savings of £17m already made this year, on top of £11m of savings last year.</p>
      <p>The council’s Labour leader Tudor Evans said since the start of the Government’s austerity programme over the last decade it had cut 60p in every £1 of funding for local authorities.</p>
      <p>He said that had resulted in the “hollowing out” of local government and the consequences could be seen in the workloads of hard-pressed social workers and housing officers.</p>
      <p>He said he wanted the General Election debate to focus on “how people value local services, and the funding of them”.</p>
      <p>Cllr Evans said at a meeting of the Labour-controlled council’s Cabinet: “People need to understand there is a choice, actually we don’t have to continue down this path which councils have gone down for the last 10 years, this hollowing out of local government.”</p>
      <p>The latest three-month budget monitoring report highlighted a £70m increase in forecast investment in the city this year to almost £335m, creating more than 5,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The report for July to September also reported an increase in the numbers of people saved from becoming homeless and children and families supported, compared to the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Local authority finances nationwide have come under increasing pressure from rising costs and demand for adult and children’s social care.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has highlighted the need for billions of pounds of extra funding for councils over the life of the next parliament to fund adult social care. People aged over 65 are expected to make up a fifth of the population by 2030.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Government said the 4.3 per cent increase in funding for local government in 2020 was the biggest year-on-year real terms increase for almost a decade, including access to an extra £1.5bn for adult and children’s social care.</p>
