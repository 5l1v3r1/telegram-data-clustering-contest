      <h1>Liverpool worried over Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson injuries ahead of Crystal Palace</h1>
      <h2>Both Salah and Robertson are struggling with ankle injuries and Liverpool officials are now worried that they could both be absent at Selhurst Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:16:34+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool are worried that they could be without both Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah when they return to Premier League action.</p>
      <p>The Reds face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in two weeks, but Jurgen Clop’s side could be forced to go without the pair, due to respective ankle problems.</p>
      <p>Robertson has pulled out of the Scotland squad for their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Cyprus.</p>
      <p>The Scotland skipper left Anfield on Sunday, after the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , with a swollen ankle but had hoped to be fit to lead Steve Clarke’s side.</p>
      <p>However, the injury has proven sufficient enough for Robertson to withdraw from the Scotland squad.</p>

      <p>Salah looked close to something like his very best against City at the weekend, scoring the Reds’ second goal in the win.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian has played through the pain recently, and has had to have fluid drained regularly since limping out of the 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on October 5, following a tackle from Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>He has also been working on a personalised training schedule at points in the last month to ensure his availability for matches.</p>

      <p>But Salah was caught during the win over City following a challenge from Fernandinho and aggravated the issue.</p>
      <p>He played on until late in the day, before being replaced five minutes from time by Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Salah insisted on reporting for international duty after the game on Sunday, after missing last month’s get-together.</p>
      <p>He has endured strained relations with his country's FA in recent years, but remains committed to playing for the Pharoahs.</p>
      <p>Egypt meet Kenya and Comoros during the break, but Salah is set to miss both after undergoing a scan on his ankle.</p>
      <p>Now he, like Robertson, faces a race against time to be fit for the clash at Selhurst Park.</p>
