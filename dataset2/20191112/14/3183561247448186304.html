      <p>'Bad' and 'bougie' aren't two words I previously used to describe myself. Until today. I can now confidently proclaim I embody both of them after gobbling down some fancy KFC in somebody else's Tesla.</p>
      <p>I don't want to eat fast food any other way again.</p>
      <p>My usual ride is a beaten up Toyota Echo. It gets me places but it grunts and squeals the whole way. So when I was offered the chance to drive a Tesla to visit a KFC store opening in Newcastle, I was extremely grateful to experience a car more expensive than the entire summation of my life. It was actually <i>just</i> the Model 3, the cheapest of the Tesla lineup, equating to around $66,000.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/kfc-just-opened-its-world-first-drive-thru-in-newcastle/">the world-first drive-through only KFC</a> visit, I was gifted with some KFC samples to try out. Being a drive-through only store, there's not really anywhere to sit and eat. With my choices being the gutter or the extremely expensive Musk-mobile, I chose the latter.</p>
      <p>To make the occasion extra special, I decided to head to somewhere nice to enjoy my fried chicken banquet. The KFC carpark wasn't really going to cut it for me.</p>
      <p>With the kids buckled in, we were ready to make our way to the nearest beach for the ultimate self-partnered date: Beach Views and Fried Chicken Bites.</p>

      <p>When I arrived my KFC was already cold but that didn't deter my spirits. I popped the lid of my Popcorn Chicken and took my first bite. Did it taste any different to eating KFC in my run-down Toyota Echo? Not really... but did I feel different? Yes, because I had transformed into the best version of myself. Upward mobility. A capitalist Cinderella story. True ratchet royalty. Also, the smell of expensive car upholstery infused with fried chicken is one I did not know I was missing in life.</p>

      <p>Driving after eating fast food was admittedly a bit of a challenge because my fingers were greasy and I didn't want to tarnish the leather with my pleb hands.</p>
      <p>My rollercoaster ride was now done but I remind myself: Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.</p>
