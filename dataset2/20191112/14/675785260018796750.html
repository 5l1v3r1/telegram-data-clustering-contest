      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING DETAILS: Sarah Barrass and family member Brandon Machin murdered her sons Tristan, 13, and Blake, 14, at her home in Sheffield more than a week after they began plotting to kill the children</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:46:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Amy Murphy, Henry Clare, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>An mum-of-six who <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murdered</a> two of her kids and plotted to kill the other four - believing they were "better off dead" than in care - has been jailed for life.</p>
      <p>Sarah Barrass strangled her son Tristan, 13, with her dressing gown cord and family member Blake Machin strangled her son Blake, 14, with his bare hands before bin bags were placed over the boys' heads.</p>
      <p>Both boys died of asphyxiation.</p>
      <p>She must serve a minimum of 35 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Barrass, 36, had hatched a plan with Machin, 39, to murder her six children because she feared they would be taken away from her.</p>
      <p>Three other children survived attempts to kill them by poisoning or drowning at the family home in the Shiregreen area of Sheffield.</p>

      <p>Barrass and Machin had been conspiring to kill the children for at least 10 days before they were found by police and paramedics on the morning of May 24.</p>
      <p>All the surviving children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are under the age of 13.</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin have each admitted two counts of murder, conspiracy to murder six children and five counts of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>Outlining details of the case, prosecutor Kama Melly QC told Sheffield Crown Court that visitors to the family home would hear Barrass tell her children: "I gave you life, I can take it away."</p>

      <p>The night before police were called to the home, Barrass and Machin forced the four eldest children, including Tristan and Blake, to swallow tablets.</p>
      <p>The evil killers had gathered up tablets from around the home and divided them among the children, expecting them to die.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly said: "None of the children wanted to take the tablets but were forced to do so."</p>
      <p>Barrass then sent messages and and wrote posts on social media claiming that the youngsters were suffering from a sickness bug.</p>

      <p>Just minutes before they were strangled, the brothers told a friend on the Nintendo Switch gaming system that they weren't going to school that Friday (May 24) because they were "feeling sick", neighbours said at the time.</p>
      <p>After the tablets failed to kill the children, Barrass scoured the internet for details on how to murder her children, including suffocating, strangulation and drowning.</p>
      <p>She then called Machin to tell him that their sick plot had failed and he came over to the house, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly went on: "They decided the children were better off dead than in care and he said he would help Sarah Barrass to the best of his ability.</p>
      <p>"Barrass and Machin first strangled Blake, then Tristan, then placed bin bags over their heads to ensure their certain death."</p>

      <p>The court heard that Barrass had strangled Tristan by wrapping her dressing gown cord around his neck and pulling on it for around three minutes, while Machin strangled Blake with his hands.</p>
      <p>The pair also tried to kill one of the younger children by attempting to drown them in a bath, but that child survived.</p>
      <p>Following the murders and the attempted murder of the younger child who was placed in a bath, the mother took the surviving children to the bedroom and phoned the police.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Barrass requested help with her children from the local authority.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly said the mother-of-six sent a message to a friend, in which she said: "I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. Mass murder, putting them all in care, checking in to the local nut house.</p>

      <p>"I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."</p>
      <p>Bryan Cox QC, mitigating for Barrass, described her crimes as "evil and nothing but evil" but said she was "profoundly damaged by her childhood".</p>
      <p>He continued: "The defendant was desperate to prevent her children being taken into care.</p>
      <p>"She couldn't cope with the prospect of them being removed."</p>
      <p>At a court appearance in May following her arrest, Barrass sobbed and claimed she was innocent, shouting from the dock: "I didn't kill my boys. Swear to God. I didn't do it. You will see."</p>

      <p>But the mum and Machin pleaded guilty to the crimes when they appeared in court in September.</p>
      <p>After that hearing, the boys' grief-stricken uncle, Martyn Barrass, told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/evil-mum-tried-kill-kids-20808557">Sunday People</a> that the siblings' killers "have been evil since birth", describing them as "psychopaths" and claiming Machin had been abusive towards the children. </p>
      <p>He said Barrass and Machin had killed pet mice for fun when they were younger and were fascinated with horror films featuring vampires, blood and gore. </p>
      <p>A Nightmare on Elm Street was one of their favourites, he added.</p>
      <p>Months before the murders, Barrass quoted the Stephen King novel Under the Dome, writing on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>: "Murder is like potato chips; you can't stop with just one."</p>

        <figcaption>Barrass had posted this image on Facebook months before the murders</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She once posted a disturbing cartoon image of the Grim Reaper holding a bloody scythe with the caption: "Coming for you."</p>
      <p>In June, an inquest heard that Tristan and Blake died 12 minutes apart after they were taken to hospital from the home.</p>
      <p>Tristan was pronounced dead at 9.14am and Blake died 12 minutes later.</p>
      <p>The brothers were laid to rest together in one coffin during their funeral in August.</p>
      <p>The boys' names were on each side of the shared coffin.</p>
      <p>An honour guard of more than 300 motorcycles and two Lamborghini cars attended the service following an appeal after it emerged the teenagers both loved bikes and cars.</p>
