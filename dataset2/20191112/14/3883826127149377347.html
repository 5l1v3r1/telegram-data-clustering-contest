        <b>A man embarked on a series of "depraved" sex attacks on women and children, one as young as 11, a court has heard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joseph McCann is accused of 37 offences against 11 alleged victims, including rapes, kidnap and false imprisonment, over two weeks in April and May.</p>
      <p>The Old Bailey heard the 34-year-old snatched two women off London streets and told one he would "never release her" as he raped her multiple times.</p>
      <p>Mr McCann of Harrow denies the charges.</p>
      <p>The jury was told the defendant's "spree of sex attacks" started in Watford before continuing in London, Greater Manchester and Cheshire.</p>
      <p>One 21-year-old woman was grabbed at knifepoint and bundled into a car as she walked home from a Watford nightclub on 21 April.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor John Price QC said she was released later that morning in a "state of great distress".</p>
      <h3>'Rape a child'</h3>
      <p>A 25-year-old woman was abducted as she walked home in Walthamstow, east London, just after midnight on 25 April.</p>
      <p>Mr Price said the defendant told her "to stop screaming or he would stab her" then dragged her into a car "and drove off".</p>
      <p>The court heard the woman was raped "many times" by Mr McCann in various locations over the next 14 hours and subjected to acts of "shocking depravity and violence".</p>
      <p>"He made her call him 'daddy' and say that she was a child. At one point the man parked the car near to a school, saying that he wanted to make her rape a child," Mr Price said.</p>
      <p>Later the same day, and while still holding the woman prisoner, the defendant abducted a 21-year-old woman in Edgware, north London, as she walked along the street with her sister, the court heard.</p>
      <p>CCTV of the woman being bundled into a silver people carrier just after midday was played to the jury.</p>
      <p>Mr Price said she "suffered a similar fate" to the 25-year-old woman before the pair managed to escape while in Watford where Mr McCann had booked a hotel room for two nights.</p>
      <p>He told the jury they would have come to "further harm" but one of the women hit their captor over the head with a vodka bottle and some builders "bravely" intervened to prevent them being recaptured.</p>
      <h3>Pensioner abducted</h3>
      <p>The attacks resumed 10 days later in the North West of England where, over 12 hours on 5 May, three women, three young girls and a boy of 11 were assaulted, the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>Mr McCann allegedly conned his way into a mother's Greater Manchester home where he tied her to the bed and raped her 17-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son.</p>
      <p>The court heard he then abducted a 71-year-old woman who was in her car at a Morrisons car park.</p>
      <p>He raped her and also sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl before both managed to escape at Knutsford Service Station on the M6, the court heard.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old is accused of then snatching two 14-year-old girls in Cheshire.</p>
      <p>Mr McCann, who was not in court, is charged with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ten counts of false imprisonment</li>
        <li>Seven counts of rape</li>
        <li>One count of rape of a child</li>
        <li>Two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent</li>
        <li>Seven counts of kidnap</li>
        <li>One count of attempted kidnap</li>
        <li>Three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity</li>
        <li>Three counts of assault by penetration</li>
        <li>One count of sexual assault</li>
        <li>Two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
