      <p>“We have been probing the alleged siphoning of claimants’ funds from the Master’s office for almost two years.”</p>
      <p>This after several complaints were lodged by victims.<br/>Masuku was arrested on Thursday and Kgosiemang handed himself over to the police on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>During the course of the investigation it was also uncovered that Masuku, a Malawian national, misrepresented the state by claiming to be South African. She allegedly bought fraudulent papers from someone within the Department of Home Affairs.</p>
      <p>The Department of Home Affairs’ immigration division has meanwhile finalised its investigation into her status in the country.</p>

      <p>The Hawks also discovered that she submitted false documents to the Department of Justice when applying for a job.</p>
      <p>Mulaudzi added that it was established that Masuku allegedly directed claimants to her so-called lawyer boyfriend to process their claims. “Some claimants never received their money. Instead it was shared among the two.”</p>
      <p>To date approximately R1,7 million has disappeared from eight families.<br/>Mulaudzi confirmed that Masuku was suspended in June when she allegedly tried to interfere with the Hawks investigation.</p>

      <p>On Friday a search and seizure operation was conducted at the boyfriend’s offices in Mbombela as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>It is suspected that the missing R1,7 million is just the tip of the iceberg. Several more victims have since lodged complaints.</p>
      <p>Affected members of the Mpumalanga community are urged to contact Capt Mandla Mphephethe on 071-481-3295.</p>
