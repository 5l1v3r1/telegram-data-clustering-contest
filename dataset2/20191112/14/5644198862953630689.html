      <p>LONDON: Hillary Clinton said Tuesday (Nov 12) it was "shameful" that the British government had not published a delayed parliamentary report into possible Russian interference in British politics ahead of December elections.</p>
      <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has previously rejected claims it was suppressing the report to avoid a scandal ahead of next month's snap poll.</p>

      <p>"Every person who votes in this country deserves to see that report before your election happens," the defeated US presidential candidate told BBC Radio 4 during a book tour.</p>

      <p>Clinton said there was "no doubt" that Russia is "determined to try to shape the politics of western democracies".</p>
      <p>"Not to our benefit, but to theirs," said the Democrat, who lost the 2016 US election to President Donald Trump in a race that US intelligence chiefs have said was marred by Russian interference.</p>
      <p>"I find it inexplicable that your government will not release a government report about Russian influence. Inexplicable and shameful," she told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p>
      <p>Britain's parliament was previously told a report by the Intelligence and Security Committee was sent to the prime minister for approval on Oct 17.</p>
      <p>The probe into suspected Russian covert actions in Britain's democratic process reportedly includes examining whether Moscow tried to interfere with the 2016 Brexit vote and the 2017 general election.</p>
      <p>Moscow has been accused of spearheading sophisticated disinformation campaigns around the world to further its interests.</p>
      <p>The Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of the country's intelligence agencies, submits its reports to the government before publication to avoid the inadvertent release of sensitive information.</p>
      <p>A former head of domestic spy agency MI5 and the committee's chairman have suggested Johnson is stalling on the release of the 50-page report with the December 12 general election looming.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Evans, head of MI5 from 2007 to 2013, called on the government to explain the delay.</p>
      <p>Foreign Office minister Chris Pincher has previously said that the report is going through "an intensive security review".</p>
      <p>Pincher has also played down concerns, saying there is "no evidence" to suggest there has been any successful Russian involvement in the British electoral system.</p>
