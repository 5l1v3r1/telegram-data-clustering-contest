      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 12 — Kay Wilson packed up her life in a hurry and moved to Los Angeles... only to find that what she paid in Pennsylvania for a nice studio apartment would only get her a 2.9-square-metre box in California.</p>
      <p>Her new home is a capsule, inspired by the famous hotels in Japan.</p>
      <p>Wilson arrived a month ago at UP(st)ART, a community for young people with artistic aspirations in need of an affordable place to live.</p>
      <p>Each room contains up to six capsules, which Wilson describes as “cosy”. They contain a single bed, a bar for hanging clothes, a few compartments for storing shoes and other items and an air vent.</p>
      <p>By most standards, the accommodation is still not cheap — US$750 (RM3,105) per month plus taxes. That works out at around US$800, which is slightly more than the 26-year-old was paying in Bethlehem, around 113km outside Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t afford a studio by myself. Not at all,” she told AFP. “It’s US$1,300 or more.”</p>
      <p>Jeremiah Adler, founder of UP(st)ART, said each capsule costs roughly half the rent of a studio in Los Angeles — the US entertainment capital, and one of its most expensive cities.</p>
      <p>Cheaper options exist, but UP(st)ART offers a good, central location and modern buildings equipped with a gym, dance classes, recording studio, art workshop and free cleaning and laundry services.</p>
      <p>Among the rules: Women and men sleep apart, and having sex is not an option.</p>
      <p>Still, the capsule-living concept is also catching on in other expensive US cities including New York.</p>

      <p>For Dana Cuff, an architect and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), this type of community presents only a short-term solution.</p>
      <p>“We basically need to be developing a huge range of options for the kinds of housing that are available,” she said. “To me, co-living pods... are symptoms of this deep need for a much greater range of housing alternatives.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Living with the minimum’</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s taco night, and around 50 people are eating together in one of the four-building complex’s communal areas.</p>
      <p>Among the group are rappers, dancers, sculptors and actors from the US and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Kimma Moonshine has lived in the community for a year, and told AFP that so far she has not found living with 90 housemates to be overwhelming.</p>
      <p>“You learn to live with the minimum,” said the Canadian 27-year-old, a painter who currently works as a nanny.</p>
      <p>She paid less at her previous home, but she prefers this option.</p>
      <p>“I had 12 roommates, the only way I could work on my art was on the kitchen table after everyone went to sleep. It’s cool having that workshop now.”</p>
      <p>Alejandro Chupina, 27, left home as a teenager because his parents did not support his career as an actor and musician.</p>
      <p>He moved into an UP(st)ART capsule eight months ago, attracted by the recording studio, and is happy with his choice.</p>
      <p>“We have so many different amenities... for what we’re paying, I feel like we’re getting way more, in different ways,” said the young man with a handlebar moustache, who can recite the musical “Hamilton” by heart.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hollywood calling</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wilson’s plan to move to Los Angeles was brought forward from a year away to just weeks when she received an offer to work in a salon.</p>
      <p>“I sold all my belongings and I moved here to be in this pod... I’m finding comfort in being uncomfortable,” she joked.</p>
      <p>But Wilson, who earns the minimum wage of US$13 per-hour plus tips, did not move to Los Angeles simply to be a salon stylist.</p>
      <p>Like many who come to Hollywood, she dreams of becoming a successful actress.</p>
      <p>UP(st)ART, which opened three years ago and resembles a cross between a college dorm and a luxury hostel, seems like the ideal place to start.</p>
      <p>“People who were here two or three years ago when they started — they’re starting to get cast in TV shows and record deals and everything like that,” said Adler.</p>
      <p>“And so that’s a rewarding thing, being able to watch people’s careers progress.” — AFP</p>
