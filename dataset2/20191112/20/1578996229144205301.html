      <h1>Kaia Gerber and Pete Davidson's Relationship Reportedly 'Became Romantic Recently'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:17:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Pete Davidson and Kaia Gerber's romantic-looking friendship is now a full-blown relationship, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1092510/inside-pete-davidson-and-kaia-gerber-s-budding-romance">E!</a> reports. The outlet details that the 25-year-old <i>SNL </i>comedian and 18-year-old model <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29729142/kaia-gerber-pete-davidson-relationship-timeline/">really did start out as friends</a>. But there was too much chemistry for them to just <i>stay </i>friends.</p>
      <p>"Kaia and Pete are definitely in a romantic relationship," a source explained to the outlet. "They have been friends for a while now and run in the same friend circle, but became romantic recently. They started hanging out alone more often after meeting up in NYC in October. Kaia expressed she loved Pete's personality. She thinks he is charming and is very intrigued."</p>
      <p>The two are feeling things out, the source added. They've spent time in Malibu, where Gerber and her family (including mom Cindy Crawford) are based, and now, Gerber is traveling back to New York City for Davidson. "They have been texting a lot this past month, and are definitely seeing where it goes," the source said. The source added that Gerber is "planning on staying in NYC" with Davidson for a "few days" ahead of the <i>SNL </i>taping this week.</p>
      <p>A second source said that Gerber isn't about to say she's in love yet. But she does <i>really, really </i>like him. "[She's]<i> </i>spending all of her time with him and is giddy about it," the source said. "[But] she isn't admitting to anything romantic and wants to keep everything under wraps. Even if she's seen out with him, she's not ready to make anything official. She says they are friends and love being together."</p>
      <p>Davidson and Gerber were first seen together last month in New York City. Gerber hinted she and Davidson could be more than friends last week when <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29729142/kaia-gerber-pete-davidson-relationship-timeline/">she wore a P necklace</a> at a LA event.</p>
