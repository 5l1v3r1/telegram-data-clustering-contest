      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:25:27+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans have given their verdict on the club's current injury situation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> saw his side depleted when Jed Steer and Matt Targett limped out of Sunday's 2-1 defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> .</p>
      <p>Steer came off just seven minutes into the Premier League clash at Molineux, while Targett was substituted for Neil Taylor in first-half injury time.</p>
      <p>First choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton missed out through injury, as did captain Jack Grealish and starting centre-back Bjorn Engels.</p>

      <p>Ezri Konsa made his debut beside Tyrone Mings, while Steer was drafted in for his first League appearance of the season.</p>
      <p>Smith <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-jota-17246723">has been handed a boost by the improving condition of Jota</a> , who is back running after a hernia operation last month.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> have two weeks to get their injured bodies back up to full speed before the next game, a Monday night showdown with Newcastle United in B6.</p>
      <p>And the claret and blue faithful have had their say on the situation on social media.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the reaction...</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Daniel Clarke</b> : After the wolves game we should be worried</p>
      <p><b>John Ryan</b> : Our B team is Championship standard so we can cope with limited injuries but injuries to several keg players , at the same time , could be a problem. Grealish sustained a seemingly innocuous injury to his shin at West Brom last season and missed 3 months and this latest injury feels similar. He makes the team tick and gives us a threat going forward that we just don't have without him.</p>
      <p><b>Chris Healy</b> : It's not the size of squad it's the quality, think we have too many squad players just for numbers rather than actual quality international break come at a good time to get players fit</p>
      <p><b>Mark Bryant</b> : the squad is big enough just not good enough</p>

      <p><b>Nick Salter</b> : The international break has come at a good time regarding injuries. We have a few who can do a decent job to cover injuries but we need quality reinforcements in January.</p>
      <p><b>Terry Jones</b> : The squad is not good enough very poor</p>
      <p><b>Dean Henvey</b> : No. Be concerned. I am. It's not about having a squad big enough, it's about the quality of the players missing and those replacing them.</p>
      <p><b>Darren Thomas</b> : The squad isn't big enough when theyre fit. We need a RB, LB, CM, a winger and a couple of strikers.</p>
      <p><b>Matthew Fitzpatrick</b> : They will all be fit apart from Steer after international break. Chill</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Adam Checkley</b> : Squad is big enough just no quality</p>
      <p><b>Gary Fenton</b> : Well didn't Dean say weeks ago so much Talent on the bench</p>
