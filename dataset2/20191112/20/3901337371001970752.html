      <p>Despite Lionel Messi's recent free-kick record, the FC Barcelona superstar still trails Cristiano Ronaldo's tally of direct free-kick goals, but how do they compare to some other famous dead-ball specialists? Here are 13 stars who have scored 50 or more goals from direct set-pieces!</p>

      <p>In the past month and a week of football, Messi has added four free-kick goals to his tally, taking him to 52 goals from dead-ball situations outside the box. The Argentine's first of the season came against Sevilla last month, while his second also came in October.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old struck two similar free-kicks against Celta Vigo in their 4-1 win at the Camp Nou this past weekend, and now trails Ronaldo by just two direct free-kicks. Despite the Portuguese forward being ahead, though, he has come under scrutiny for his form from dead balls of late.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo has scored just three free-kicks goals since the 2016/17 campaign, while his eternal rival has scored 19 during the same period. Neither of them, though, are among the 10 deadliest set-piece takers of all time, but they are among the 13 players who have scored 50 free-kicks or more.</p>
      <p>Household names such as Ronald Koeman and Diego Maradona are on the star-studded list, as is former Manchester United superstar David Beckham and two-time FIFA World Player of the Year Ronaldinho.</p>
