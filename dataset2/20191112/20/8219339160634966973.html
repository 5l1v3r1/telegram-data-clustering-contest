      <h1>Former HBO CEO in ‘advanced talks’ with Apple TV+ for an exclusive production deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:25:46+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hbo-ex-ceo-in-advanced-talks-to-sign-exclusive-production-deal-with-appletv-11573588982?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1">The<i> Wall Street Journal</i></a> reports today that former HBO CEO Richard Plepler is in talks to sign an exclusive production deal with Apple TV+. According to the report, a deal could be finalized within the next “few weeks.”</p>
      <p>Under the agreement, Plepler’s new company RLP &amp; Co. would exclusively produce original content for Apple TV+. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> emphasizes that this would be a notable deal for Apple, given the shows that were green-lit and developed under Plepler’s tenure at HBO:</p>
      <blockquote>If Apple lands Mr. Plepler it would be getting one of the most well-regarded entertainment executives of the last decade. Under his watch as chief executive of HBO, the pay channel prospered. Hits developed while he was at the helm included <i>Game of Thrones</i> and <i>Veep</i>.</blockquote>
      <p>In 2007, Pleper was named co-president of HBO alongside Michael Lombardo. During this time period, HBO began production on shows such as <i>The Newsroom</i>, <i>True Blood</i>, and more. Pleper then served as the CEO and chairman of HBO from 2013 through February 2019.</p>
      <p>Plepler stepped down from the helm of HBO amid restructuring <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/06/14/att-acquires-time-warner/">following AT&amp;T’s acquisition of Time Warner</a>. Reports around that time indicated that WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey wanted HBO to go in a new direction, with Stankey saying that HBO needed to transform into a broader network if it wanted compete with the likes of Netflix.</p>
      <p>Apple TV+ debuted less than two weeks ago. Yesterday, it was reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/kim-rozenfeld-apple-tv/">that a minor internal reorganization</a> had recently taken place, with Apple’s head of current scripted programming and unscripted content leaving his role.</p>
      <p>Apple inking an exclusive deal with Plepler’s company would be a major victory for TV+. Today’s report indicates that the deal could be finalized within just a few weeks.</p>
