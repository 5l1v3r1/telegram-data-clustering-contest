      <p>Dutch police have arrested a man who threatened in a social media post to blow himself up over plans to sideline "Black Pete", a Christmas-time character provoking accusations of racist stereotyping.</p>
      <p>The arrest is the latest controversy over the country's traditional Saint Nicholas side kick, portrayed in winter parades and by many Dutch children with a black face, thick red lips, woolly hair and a golden earring.</p>
      <p>"A 49-year-old man from The Hague was arrested on Monday afternoon after he threatened to blow himself up in support of the Saint Nicholas tradition," police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The suspect made a comment on Facebook over the weekend, which led to a lot of social unrest."</p>
      <p>Prosecutors examined the comment and decided to arrest the man at his home on Monday but did not find any explosives. He will appear before a judge on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"The man in a statement admitted he posted the comment and that he was sorry, after seeing the reaction it created," they added.</p>
      <p>Police said several other supporters and opponents of the character - known as Zwarte Piet in Dutch -- had recently "made strong statements back and forth" on social media but that "as long as no criminal limit is exceeded, everyone can give their opinion".</p>
      <p>The arrest is the latest in an increasingly bitter dispute between those who see Black Pete as a harmless children's character and those who say it is a throwback to slavery and racist oppression.</p>
      <p>Dutch police arrested five men on Friday after angry pro-Black Pete protesters threw rocks and fireworks at a meeting of a group called "Kick Out Zwarte Piet".</p>
      <p>Police will also be on alert on Saturday when Saint Nicholas makes his traditional arrival in the central Dutch city of Apeldoorn.</p>
      <p>The parade will for the first time feature no traditional Black Petes, only so-called "Sooty Petes" with dark marks on their faces said to be the result of crawling down the chimney.</p>
      <p>In 2015 a UN committee said the character sometimes reflected "negative stereotypes" and was seen as "a vestige of slavery" by many people.</p>
      <p>Many Dutch have grown up with the tradition and children often dress as Black Pete as they await December 6, when their shoes are filled with chocolate - an act of generosity attributed to the saint</p>
