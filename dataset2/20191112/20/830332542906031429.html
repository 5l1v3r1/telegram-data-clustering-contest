      <h1>Buttigieg joins top tier of candidates in new Iowa poll</h1>
      <h2>Poll: He's up 14 percentage points since August</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg joined the leaders of the Democratic race for president in Iowa, up 14 percentage points since August, according to a new <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_111219/">Monmouth University poll</a> of likely caucusgoers out Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg garnered 22% support, in the top tier with former Vice President Joe Biden (19%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (18%). Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also made gains from Monmouth's August poll, but with 13%, fell outside of the top three status in Iowa.</p>
      <p>Because their support falls within the margin of error, there is no clear leader in the Iowa poll, with Buttigieg, Warren, and Biden making up the top tier of candidates.</p>
      <p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar received 5% support from likely Democratic Iowa caucusgoers, followed by California Sen. Kamala Harris, businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang with 3% each, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard with 2%. No other candidate received above 1% support in the poll.</p>
      <p>Harris was down from 12% in August, reflecting other polls showing her dipping nationally and in key states.</p>
      <p>Only 28% of likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa have definitely made up their mind about who they will support, compared to 61% who said they are open to other possibilities and 8% who have no first choice. Almost 3 in 10 report they'd be very disappointed if they had to vote for someone other than their first choice, 41% would be mildly disappointed and another 20% wouldn't mind.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg continues to lead the pack in terms of favorable ratings, with 73% of likely Democratic caucus attendees in Iowa have a positive opinion of him and 10% negative -- numbers that have remained steady since August. Warren and Biden have both dipped slightly in their net favorability ratings, with their favorability decreasing and unfavorability increasing.</p>
      <p>Around a third of likely caucus-goers have seen a candidate so far this year, with 17% who have seen Buttigieg. Fifteen percent have seen Warren and 14% have seen Sanders. Around one-in-10 have seen Biden, Harris, Klobuchar, and Booker.</p>
      <p>Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who was added on the second day of the five-day polling period, doesn't hit 1% in the poll, after filing paperwork for the Alabama presidential primary last week. Almost 1 in 5 likely caucus-goers have a favorable opinion of him, while 48% have an unfavorable opinion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_IA_111219/">The Monmouth University Poll </a>was conducted by telephone from November 7 to 11, 2019, with 451 Iowa voters who are likely to attend the Democratic presidential caucuses in February 2020. The question results have a margin of error of +/- 4.6 percentage points.</p>
