      <h1>Singer Moby tattoos 'ANIMAL RIGHTS' on arms for 32-year vegan anniversary</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- Singer Moby has been a fairly vocal about his animal rights advocacy and veganism, and now he has the tats to back it up.</p>
      <p>The electro-style rocker celebrated his 32nd year of being vegan by getting 12 tattooed letters on both his arms which spell out “ANIMAL RIGHTS,” he said in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4xXSMUoKHI/">Instagram post</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m a vegan animal rights activist for many reasons, but ultimately because I believe at the core of my being that every animal has the right to live their own life, according to their own will,” he added.</p>
      <p>He also thanked fellow vegan tattoo artist Kat Von D for the fresh ink.</p>
      <p>Moby, who is also a record producer, DJ and author, has cited health and climate change as reasons he’s gone vegan. He has a long history of supporting vegan and animal rights causes. He even released an album called “<a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/moby/animal-rights/">Animal Rights</a>” in 1996.</p>
      <p>He launched the Los Angeles <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Baho1HbDRLt/?utm_source=ig_embed">vegan restaurant Little Pine </a>and regularly shares recipes, photos and videos of his vegan meals.</p>
      <p>Moby also runs the Circle V music festival, which raises money for animal protection charity, Mercy for Animals.</p>
      <p>This isn’t even the first vegan-related tattoo he’s gotten recently. In September, a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2hLcAphYZG/?utm_source=ig_embed">post showed how he’d tattooed </a>“VEGAN FOR LIFE” on the right side of his neck.</p>
      <p>At the time, he wrote that because of his veganism “getting this tattoo seemed like a pretty safe bet.”</p>
      <p>Moby added that “working for animal rights and animal liberation is my life’s work.”</p>
