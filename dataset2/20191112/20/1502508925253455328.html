      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:48:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:48</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/s-p-500">S&amp;P 500 </a>and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq">Nasdaq </a>indexes edged higher after earlier hitting record peaks on Tuesday while the Dow dipped slightly as President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>said the United States is close to signing an initial trade deal with China but offered no new details about negotiations.</p>
      <p>Stocks were off session highs after a highly anticipated midday speech from Trump, with investors concerned ahead of time about any comments that would worsen the tariff dispute that has convulsed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-markets-1160103.htm">markets </a>for more than a year.</p>
      <p>Trump said U.S. and Chinese negotiators were "close" to a "phase one" trade deal, but largely repeated well-worn rhetoric about China's "cheating" on trade in remarks at The Economic Club of New York.</p>
      <p>"The commentary was exactly what folks wanted to hear: that 'phase one' talks are still ongoing, that we are controlling them, but yet the belief is that China is very willing to make a deal," said Delores Rubin, senior equities trader at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management in New York.</p>
      <p>"There was nothing contrary to what we'd already known ... so it was back to business," Rubin said.</p>
      <p>Investors have pointed to U.S.-China trade tensions as the main market uncertainty as stocks have climbed to record levels, fueled by rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, third-quarter earnings coming in above low expectations, and signs the economy may be bottoming.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average &lt;.DJI&gt; fell 15.67 points, or 0.06%, to 27,675.82, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/s-p-500">S&amp;P 500 </a>&lt;.SPX&gt; gained 2.54 points, or 0.08%, to 3,089.55 and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq">Nasdaq </a>Composite &lt;.IXIC&gt; added 10.53 points, or 0.12%, to 8,474.81.</p>
      <p>Most <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/s-p-500">S&amp;P 500 </a>sectors were in positive territory, with healthcare &lt;.SPXHC&gt; gaining the most. Energy &lt;.SPNY&gt; lagged the most, falling 0.9%.</p>
      <p>Among stocks, Walt Disney Co rose 1.3% as the company said demand for its much-anticipated streaming service, Disney+, was well above its expectations in a launch.</p>
      <p>Shares of Netflix Inc were down 1.2%.</p>
      <p>Rockwell Automation Inc jumped 11.1% after the U.S. factory equipment maker easily beat quarterly results and forecast 2020 earnings above estimates.</p>
      <p>CBS Corp dropped 3.3% after the media company missed quarterly revenue estimates. Shares of Viacom Inc , which is merging with CBS, were also down 3.6%.</p>
      <p>With third-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, about three-quarters of S&amp;P 500 companies have topped profit estimates, but overall they are expected to have posted a 0.5% drop in earnings, according to Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Earnings from big firms including Walmart Inc , Nvidia Corp and Cisco Systems Inc , as well as a fresh set of economic data, are due this week.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nasdaq">Nasdaq </a>Composite recorded 104 new highs and 88 new lows.</p>
