      <p>It's crazy to think <i>Shovel Knight</i> first released in 2014 and more than five years later we're still talking about potent content updates to what is arguably the most successful Kickstarter game ever. After several delays, Yacht Club Games is finally ready to release what should be the final two big updates for its flagship title. On December 10, <i>Shovel Knight: King of Cards</i> and <i>Shovel Knight: Showdown</i> will release, along with a new physical copy of <i>Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove</i> that includes every bit of <i>Shovel Knight</i> content.</p>
      <p>Except for PS4. That physical version of the game has been delayed into 2020. Also releasing on December 10 is the Gold Shovel Knight amiibo and the Treasure Trove amiibo 3-pack that I preordered from Best Buy at least two years ago.</p>
      <p><i>King of Cards</i> features a single-player campaign that stars King Knight defeating the reigning kings to ascend to his rightful place on the throne. <i>Showdown</i> is a multiplayer fighter featuring more than 16 playable characters and a story mode for each of them. Both games can be purchased individually for $9.99 or downloaded as part of the <i>Treasure Trove</i>. As a reminder, <i>Showdown</i> will not be coming to the Nintendo 3DS nor to the PlayStation Vita.</p>
