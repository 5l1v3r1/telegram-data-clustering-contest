      <h1>Disney+ Drops Lost Avengers: Endgame Scene With Tony Stark and His Daughter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:56:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:56</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Katherine Langford was cast in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a> as Morgan Stark, an older version of Tony Stark’s daughter. However, her big MCU moment was missing from the final cut of <b>Endgame</b>. It didn’t even make it onto <b>Endgame</b>‘s Blu-ray release! But now, Disney+ is letting fans see Tony’s lost scene with his teenage daughter.</p>
      <p>The scene in question takes place immediately after Tony snapped away Thanos with the Infinity Stones. Tony finds himself in Soul World, the realm inside the Soul Stone; which allows him to ponder if he made a mistake. It also gives him a chance to say goodbye.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Disney+ included Joe and Anthony Russo’s directors commentary about the scene. They apparently believed it was redundant after Tony’s recorded message. They also felt it would’ve created a scenario with “too many endings.”</p>
      <p>This was also why the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/461631-avengers-endgame-directors-explain-why-they-cut-a-pivotal-scene">“heroes’ tribute” scene</a> was also cut from the film. And, finally, the Russos didn’t think audiences would connect with an older version of Morgan’s.</p>

      <p>The scene is somewhat similar to Thanos’ Soul World moment from <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-infinity-war"><b>Avengers: Infinity War</b></a>. There, Thanos also had a moment with a younger version of his adopted daughter, Gamora. There are also a number of new <b>Endgame</b> deleted scenes on Disney+. These include new interactions between the Hulk and the Ancient One, as well as a change in Black Widow’s fate on Vormir.</p>
      <p>For those that don’t have Disney+, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzg5rfwI34&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR2djnngH9Hx8xo8DejYJ24XDu50NaFUW3duu7RbW4wOxQPO5_fA0rFnRbs">Super Talk</a> also posted the Starks’ scene on YouTube. But Marvel may remove it later on, due to copyright.</p>
