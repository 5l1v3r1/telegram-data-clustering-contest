      <h1>Bank of Canada official urges public-private sector defence against cyberattacks</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- Government bodies and the private sector need more ways to share information about cybersecurity threats, and that may require new regulations or legislation, a Bank of Canada official said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Filipe Dinis, the central bank's chief operating officer, said in a speech to a cybersecurity conference in Toronto that sometimes the regulatory frameworks that are designed to protect institutions and customers "can get in the way" of collaboration.</p>
      <p>"Our regulatory environment has historically focused on protecting privacy and promoting competition. These are important objectives, but we need to increase our focus on the resilience of the financial sector."</p>
      <p>That means it's necessary to reconsider current regulations and think about the necessary tradeoffs between cybersecurity, competition and privacy, he said.</p>
      <p>Dinis didn't recommend specific changes but said "at a minimum, regulatory frameworks should not be an impediment to collaboration."</p>
      <p>Among his suggestions: put in place secure channels to transmit sensitive information between companies, agencies or other trusted sources and government-mandated testing throughout industries and between sectors of the industry.</p>
      <p>He also suggested Canadian regulations and terminology be compatible with international norms to help cross-border collaboration and decrease opportunities for companies to exploit jurisdictions with weaker cybersecurity regulations.</p>
      <p>Dinis gave his speech to a conference organized by the Information Technology Association of Canada, about a week before the Bank of Canada releases a semi-annual report on the state of the country's financial system.</p>
      <p>Recent reports have stated that threats to cybersecurity are a top concern and Dinis said he expects that will be the case in the next update.</p>
      <p>He said there have been improvements to the Bank of Canada's cybersecurity protections over the past five years -- including a new operations centre in Calgary that can take over the central bank's critical functions in an emergency.</p>
      <p>But he added the best defence for Canada's overall economy is broad collaboration and information sharing -- particularly in critical industries such as banking, telecommunications, energy and transportation.</p>
      <p>"Some of that is occurring now. I'd love to see more," Dinis said.</p>
      <p>He emphasized, repeatedly, that he's "very mindful" of the need for privacy protections but added that the ideal collaboration would allow the free flow of information about detected threats between trusted partners.</p>
      <p>"Ideally, when I'm talking about sharing information -- threat information, in particular -- that would occur within a trusted environment and it would occur across sectorial ecosystems (such as the financial and telecom sectors)."</p>
      <p>Dinis didn't address specific Canadian security or data breaches but his comments come after Desjardins Group reported on Nov. 1 that all 4.2 million members of its financial co-operative had personal information stolen in a security breach, up from the original estimate of 2.9 million customers when the breach was disclosed in June.</p>
      <p>Quebec provincial police, the province's access to information commission and the federal privacy commissioner are investigating the Desjardins breach.</p>
