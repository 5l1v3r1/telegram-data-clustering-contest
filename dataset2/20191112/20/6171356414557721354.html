      <h1>Get a eufyCam E with HomeBase for $130, a new low ($100 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:29:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/mark-koegel/" target="_blank">Mark Koegel</a></address>
      <p>Creating a home security system can be a daunting task to undertake, but Anker's eufyCam lineup seeks to make it just a bit simpler. We've <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/17/eufycam-e-wireless-camera-deal/">previously seen</a> this camera at a low of $160, but today's deal undercuts that price by $30. You can grab the camera kit at this new low of $130 using the code <b>EUFY86CM </b>at Amazon.</p>

      <p>The most compelling feature of the eufyCam E is that it has no needs for any wires. It connects to its base station wirelessly, and it has a battery that lasts an entire year. This makes it easy to mount the camera anywhere you need it. To that end, the kit comes with two mounts: a quick detach magnetic mount and a fixed outdoor mount, to be used when you'd prefer the camera not be stolen—although the device also has an anti-theft alarm that is triggered when it detects it is being forcibly removed.</p>
      <p>The camera is completely weatherproof with an IP65 dust and waterproof rating. It's equipped with a 140° 1080p lens with night vision, and has bidirectional audio through which you can communicate using the EufySecurity app.</p>
      <p>To get the $100 discount, remember to use the coupon code <b>EUFY86CM</b>. The $130 reduced price should display in your cart after applying.</p>
