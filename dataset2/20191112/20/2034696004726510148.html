      <p><i>Phoenix Nights</i> ended after two series in 2002. Soon after its finale, Kay revealed a third series had already been written, but co-creator Dave Spike initially downplayed any suggestions of a return.</p>
      <p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/peter-kay-phoenix-nights-third-season-written-2065886">Kay claimed that a third season of the popular show has been written</a> – but that “things [had] got in the way” of actually filming it.</p>
      <p>“I love <i>Phoenix Nights</i> and I would love to go back. I’ve got a lot of ideas about <i>Phoenix Nights</i>,” he said. “In fact, there’s a whole series three been written for about 15 years but so many things get in the way in life like touring and being a father. Real life continues and [his latest series] <i>Car Share</i> takes about a year to make and edit.”</p>
      <p>In mentioning <i>Car Share</i>, Kay also confirmed that a third season of the Sian Gibson-starring comedy wouldn’t be happening.</p>
      <p>“There’s not going to be a series three of <i>Car Share</i> so it won’t ever happen,” he declared. “You’ve got to get out while the going’s good. No Christmas special, no.”</p>
