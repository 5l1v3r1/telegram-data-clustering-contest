      <p>Volcom is the official sponsor of the US snowboard team through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. I don’t care, and maybe neither do you, but they’ve successfully communicated this message to us by assembling a handful of celebrities for a comedy sketch.</p>
      <p>Two of those celebrities are Run The Jewels, who appear in a mock press conference (not unlike <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063670/coldplay-everyday-live-jordan-livestream-carrie-brownstein-fred-armisen/video/">the one Coldplay staged a couple weeks ago</a>) to announce the sponsorship deal. They proceed to announce that they’ll be joining the team, El-P as a snowboarder and Killer Mike as a coach. Further absurdities ensue, including an attempt to embarrass RTJ by <i>I Think You Should Leave</i> maestro Tim Robinson and an appearance by Shaquille O’Neal as the head of US snowboarding, and also as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116756/">Kazaam</a>.</p>
      <p>Is any of this funny? Not really. Were drugs involved? Probably! Did RTJ make a lot of money for participating? Presumably they did, and good for them. Will <i>RTJ4</i> ever come out? I certainly hope so; it’s been almost three years since <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1917465/premature-evaluation-run-the-jewels-rtj3/franchises/premature-evaluation/">the last one</a>. Lastly, will Shaq have a guest verse on said album, and will it be a <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2059963/shaq-damian-lillard-are-making-diss-songs-about-each-other/wheres-the-beef/">Damian Lillard diss</a>? Stranger things have happened — like this video, which you can watch below.</p>
