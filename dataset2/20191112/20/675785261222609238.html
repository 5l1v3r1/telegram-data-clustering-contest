      <h1>Riyad Mahrez admits finding Pep Guardiola decision "difficult to live with" at Man City</h1>
      <h2>The former Leicester winger is starting to fulfill his potential at the Etihad but says he struggled to accept his lack of playing time at the beginning of his City career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:44:50+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:44</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez admits he found it mentally “difficult to live with” not being one of Pep Guardiola’s main men last season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> winger was the club’s record signing last year when he made a £60million move from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Despite not playing regularly last season he has once again made the shortlist for the coveted Ballon d’Or trophy.</p>
      <p>But he believes he’d have as good a chance as the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> pair Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah with more first-team football.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the season, I spent several matches on the bench,” said Mahrez. “Mentally, it was very difficult to live with. But in training I put everything into it because I still had this aim with Algeria. I said to myself: ‘Go for it, at one moment Pep (Guardiola) will need you.’”</p>

      <p>Mahrez, who went on to win the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria, played only 14 of City’s Premier League games from the start last season with 13 of them coming from the bench.</p>
      <p>He made five FA Cup appearances from the start and lined up in four League Cup games with one appearance from the bench.</p>
      <p>This season Mahrez has started five of City’s 12 Premier League games with three more appearances from the bench.</p>
      <p>He has insisted, however, he has a good relationship with Guardiola. “He’s really very simple,” Mahrez said.</p>
      <p>“He is a winner, he is there to make us progress. Guardiola, he’ll explain everything to us, decrypt everything, from A to Z, with the aim of facilitating the match.</p>

      <p>“He is focused on the game. I love meetings with the coach. The video with him is fascinating because we constantly learn.</p>
      <p>“The dressing room of a big club is another reality. You have to fight non-stop. Being relaxed isn’t tolerated.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking to do more, because if you don’t, you know someone else will play instead of you.</p>
      <p>“To make a good match, it is not enough any more, it is necessary to make very, very good matches all the time. That’s Manchester City.”</p>
