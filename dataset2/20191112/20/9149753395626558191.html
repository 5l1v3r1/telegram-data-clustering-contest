      <h1>This Dell 24-inch 1080p 144HZ gaming monitor is on sale for $150 ahead of Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:25:55+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jorge-jimenez/" target="_blank">Jorge Jimenez</a></address>
      <p>Walmart isn't shying away from some early Black Friday gaming deals on a cheap gaming monitor from Dell. The <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Dell-24-1920x1080-HDMI-VGA-144hz-1ms-HD-LED-Gaming-LED-Monitor-S2419HGF-3-Year-Advanced-Exchange-Warranty/943517384">Dell 24-inch S241HGF FreeSync gaming monitor</a> is currently on sale for half-price at $149.99. Not a bad choice for bargain hunters. </p>
      <p>The Dell S241HGF is a 1080p Free Sync compatible gaming monitor with a TN display at 144Hz (overclocked to 155Hz) with a 1ms response rate. It has three different gaming modes, an adjustable stand, and LED edge lighting. The included three-year exchange warranty should cover any issues that may come up. Free Sync compatibility is always welcome—I think it's safe to say that everyone hates visual tearing. </p>
      <p>For $150, you're getting a pretty decent budget gaming monitor for gamers who only play in 1080p or need a second monitor to play consoles. The bezel around the monitor is a little thicker than we would like, but other than that it's not a bad choice if you need something for work and play that won't cost you an arm and a leg. </p>
