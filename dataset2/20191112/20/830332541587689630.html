      <h1>Supreme Court allows Sandy Hook families to sue Remington</h1>
      <h2>Decision marks a blow to gun industry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:51:57+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author">Ariane de Vogue, CNN Business</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-168.html">won't stop</a> a lawsuit brought by Sandy Hook victims' families against Remington Arms Co., the manufacturer of the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the 2012 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/politics/gun-control-racial-politics-dave-chappelle-sandy-hook-psa/index.html">mass shooting</a> at an elementary school.</p>
      <p>The Court decided not to take up an appeal by Remington. That marks a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/10/27/politics/gun-reform-legislation-stalled-impeachment-inquiry-pittsburgh-synagogue/index.html">blow to the gun industry</a>: Depending on the outcome of the case, it could open the door to gun violence victims' families suing gun manufacturers for damages.</p>
      <p>The Sandy Hook victims' families are "grateful" for the Supreme Court's decision, attorneys for the families said in a statement. They called Remington's appeal the company's "latest attempt to avoid accountability."</p>
      <p>A spokesman from Remington could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>A 2005 federal law protects many gun manufacturers from wrongful death lawsuits brought by family members. But families of victims of the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, are pushing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/mass-shootings-gun-manufacturers-sandy-hook/index.html">different approach</a>.</p>
      <p>A survivor and families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting are attempting to hold Remington Arms Company, the manufacturer of the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the crime, partly responsible by targeting the company's marketing strategy.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the victims sued Remington contending that the company marketed rifles by extolling the militaristic qualities of the rifle and reinforcing the image of a combat weapon -- in violation of a Connecticut law that prevents deceptive marketing practices.</p>
      <p>The rifle was "designed as a military weapon" and "engineered to deliver maximum carnage" with extreme efficiency, they argue in legal briefs.</p>
      <p>The attorneys said Tuesday they are ready to resume discovery and proceed towards trial "to shed light on Remington's profit-driven strategy" to expand the market for high-powered, semi-automatic guns and "court high-risk users at the expense of Americans' safety."</p>
      <p>Remington is a private company, but shares of competitor Sturm Ruger &amp; Co. fell less than 1%, and American Outdoor Brands, maker of Smith &amp; Wesson guns, fell by 1.2%.</p>
      <p>The consumer market for rifles has fallen precipitously in recent years. Colt, the manufacturer of the AR-15 rifle, has announced it's exiting the consumer rifle market. A similar gun was used in the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>
