      <p>Angry <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-shooting.html?module=inline">demonstrators spread out across Hong Kong</a> on Tuesday, disrupting transportation and the central business district and setting fires on a college campus, while riot police officers sprayed tear gas and water cannons to try to stop them.</p>
      <p>The clashes came a day after the nearly six-month-old protests <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">turned particularly violent.</a> On Monday, a police officer shot a protester at point-blank range, and a man who scolded protesters was set on fire. Both victims were in critical condition on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Protesters are calling for greater democracy and policy accountability and have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/world/asia/carrie-lam-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">not been satisfied by concessions</a> made by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam.</p>
      <p>The city is scheduled to hold elections on Nov. 24. Protesters hope to convert deep public anger into electoral gains, but the authorities have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/world/asia/joshua-wong-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">barred a prominent democracy activist from running.</a></p>
      <p>Ms. Lam told reporters on Tuesday that her government would do its “very best” to ensure the elections were held in a “fair, just, safe, orderly” manner.</p>
      <p>Here are photos from the protests on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A protester hurled a projectile at the police during a clash on the Chinese University of Hong Kong campus.</p>
      <p>Protesters shared the location of nearby police officers over a megaphone, so they could deploy other demonstrators around the campus.</p>

      <p>In the evening, riot police officers lined a street on the campus.</p>
      <p>The protesters turned to makeshift items like artwork and tree branches from around campus to use as shields.</p>

      <p>The demonstrations lasted until late into the evening.</p>
      <p>The protesters, mostly students, used a bus to block a road.</p>
      <p>Protesters were met with a barrage of tear gas.</p>
      <p>Until recently, university campuses had remained generally untouched.</p>
