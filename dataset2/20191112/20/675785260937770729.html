      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:29:03+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Raheem Sterling attempted to get Joe Gomez in a headlock as they clashed in the England canteen, according to new reports.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has axed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> forward Sterling from the Three Lions' Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro as a result of the bust-up.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred on Monday when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> centre-back Gomez was in the canteen greeting his international team-mates.</p>
      <p>Gomez spotted Sterling sitting down and walked over to him to say hello.</p>
      <p>Sterling responded with the comment: "So you think you're the big man?", which sparked laughter from the other players - including Gomes.</p>
      <p>The players thought the 24-year-old was joking, but things took a sudden turn.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1371780/2019/11/12/full-on-food-everywhere-sterlings-clash-gomez-southgate-u-turn/?redirected=1">The Athletic,</a> Sterling got to his feet and attempted to get Gomez in a headlock, knocking food over on the table in the process.</p>
      <p>A source told the publication: "It was a pretty full-on thing and food went everywhere. Sterling behaved like a bit of a child."</p>
      <p>England boss Southgate spoke to the press on Tuesday, where he confirmed Sterling let his emotions get the better of him.</p>

      <p>"We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we've been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately the emotions of yesterday's game were still raw.</p>

      <p>"My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken.</p>
      <p>"Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it's important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night."</p>
