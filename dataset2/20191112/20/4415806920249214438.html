      <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has accused Boris Johnson of following the commands of US President Donald Trump on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Addressing a campaign rally in Cardiff, Ms Swinson suggested there was also a secret deal between the British Prime Minister and the Brexit Party after Nigel Farage said he would stand down candidates in the 317 seats won by the Tories in 2017.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said the PM was doing Mr Trump’s bidding on Brexit.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader told activists: “We see the deal with Nigel Farage. We see President Donald Trump saying in interviews that he wanted them to come together.</p>
      <p>“And for Boris Johnson, President Trump’s wish is his command.</p>
      <p>“Now, this is someone who has struggled to follow basic instructions when it comes to, you know, write a letter, but President Trump says that and immediately, there you go, there’s some deal.</p>
      <p>“Who knows what he has promised Nigel Farage, but one thing is certain – if Nigel Farage wants that Brexit to happen that is not something that will be good for the people of our country.”</p>

      <p>Launching the Lib Dem campaign in Wales, Ms Swinson insisted the party would win “many more” seats, but refused to set a target figure.</p>
      <p>At present, the Lib Dems have just one seat in Wales after winning the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election in August.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson also welcomed anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray being selected as a candidate for the party in the seat of Cynon Valley.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader insisted that Mr Bray, who is famous for appearing in the background of TV broadcasts outside Parliament brandishing anti-EU withdrawal placards, would not be seen as a joke candidate.</p>
