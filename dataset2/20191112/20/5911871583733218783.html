      <p>Kristen Stewart has a Pinegrove tattoo, <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/11/12/kristen-stewart-pinegrove-tattoo-charlies-angels-interview"><i>The Fader</i></a> reports. What? OK. Let’s back up.</p>
      <p>Stewart is in the middle of the promo cycle for the latest <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> reboot. Just last weekend, she <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063755/saturday-night-live-kristen-stewart-corporate-nightmare-song/video/">hosted <i>SNL</i></a>, and this week the churn of interviews continues. One such spot found her seated with costars Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska for Fandango.</p>
      <p>During this joint interview, the subject of music came up — specifically, the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063601/ariana-grande-normani-nicki-minaj-bad-to-you/music/"><i>Charlie’s Angels</i> soundtrack</a> executive produced by Ariana Grande. Stewart says she hasn’t heard it, which isn’t surprising; judging from her involvement in music videos for the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1913965/the-rolling-stones-ride-em-on-down-video-feat-kristen-stewart/video/">Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1938040/chvrches-down-side-of-me-live-video-dir-kristen-stewart/video/">Chvrches</a>, and <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2011406/interpol-kristen-stewart-finn-wittrock-if-you-really-love-nothing/video/">Interpol</a>, mainstream pop and rap may not be her style. Indeed, once they get to riffing about the music they enjoyed on the set, she begins listing off favorites including the Cure and the Specials.</p>
      <p>That’s when Scott mentions Stewart got her costars into Pinegrove, which prompts Stewart to confirm that not only are the Montclair, New Jersey indie rockers her favorite band, she has a Pinegrove tattoo — presumably the group’s double-square logo. This checks out: Last year Pinegrove’s Evan Stephens Hall posted a photo of himself with Stewart on his Instagram story, and she’s been spotted wearing one of their T-shirts. Behold the evidence below.</p>
