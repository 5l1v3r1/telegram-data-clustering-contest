      <h1>Hillary Clinton: 'I'm under enormous pressure' to run in 2020</h1>

      <p>Hillary Clinton said she is fielding a plethora of calls urging her to rethink her decision to sit out of the 2020 race.</p>
      <p>"As I say, never, never, never say never," the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07tqq3g">told BBC Radio 5 Live</a> host Emma Barnett when asked if she was ruling out a future in public office.</p>
      <p>"I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it," Clinton said. "But as of this moment, sitting here in this studio talking to you, that is absolutely not in my plans.”</p>
      <p>Clinton, 72, admitted that she thinks “all the time” about what kind of president she would have been if she had won the 2016 election instead of President Trump.</p>
      <p>“Of course I think about it. I think about it all the time,” Clinton said.</p>
      <p>If Clinton is a late entrant into the 2020 race, she’ll have missed <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/time-running-short-for-new-2020-democrats-to-jump-in-as-filing-deadlines-approach">the window to be on the Democratic primary ballot in several states</a>, including the Nov. 15 deadline for New Hampshire, the first state to hold its primary.</p>
      <p>The filing deadline for Alabama was earlier this week, and Arkansas’s deadline is today. Several other Super Tuesday states have deadlines in December.</p>
