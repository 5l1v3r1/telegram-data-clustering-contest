      <p>After a small-scale test, 'Minecraft Earth' is opening itself up to players in the United States as part of a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/29/minecraft-earth-set-to-enter-early-access-in-october">previously-advised</a> early access period. Like the original "Minecraft," players will be able to collaborate on structure construction, and to team up for mini-adventures and battles. <br/><br/>"<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/05/17/minecraft-earth-brings-ar-based-block-gaming-to-ios-this-summer">Minecraft Earth</a>"is an augmented reality game that brings Minecraft into the real world. Players will be able to build structures that "overlap" with the real world when viewed on a phone screen. Other games, such as "Pokemon Go," have similar AR features.</p>

      <p>Players will be able to create structures using materials they find and place them in a persistent real world. Structures can be built at a small scale, but then later deployed at full-size, giving a new perspective to player creations. <br/><br/>A collection aspect will be offered, with the option to breed new creatures that can be used to populate the builds. <br/><br/>"Minecraft Earth" will be available on devices that can run <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/ios">iOS</a> 10 and up, plus Android 7 and newer versions. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-earth/id1467316099">The game is free</a>, but there are substantial in-game currency purchases available.</p>
