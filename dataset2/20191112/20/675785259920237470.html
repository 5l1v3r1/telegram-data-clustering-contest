      <h1>General election: Coronation Street star eyes being an MP one day as she comes home - to meet Corbyn</h1>
      <h2>Nicola Thorp plays Nicola Rubinstein in the ITV soap and is a passionate Labour supporter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:39:06+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Coronation Street's Nicola Thorp opened the door to becoming a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP as she met <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> in her hometown.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old campaigner returned to Blackpool - a stone's throw from the rock factory her grandfather Bill founded in 1969.</p>
      <p>The TV star, who plays Nicola Rubinstein in the ITV soap, won't rule out standing herself one day - as long as it's in the town.</p>
      <p>"It’s not a never, of course! I’m positive. Never say never," she said.</p>
      <p>"I think it’s really important that younger people, particularly younger women, get involved with politics."</p>

      <p>The actor shot to prominence in 2016 when she was sacked from a temp job for refusing to wear high heels - sparking outcry.</p>
      <p>She joined Corrie in 2017 and yon Tuesday she joined Labour's leader on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>In a joint interview with the Mirror, Mr Corbyn declared he will stay as Prime Minister for five full years if he wins the election.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn - who will be 75 by 2024 - said he will "absolutely" stay the full length of a Parliament if he wins adding: "I’m fit and healthy and very happy."</p>
      <p>A YouGov poll put the Tories 14 points ahead of Labour.</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn said: "I never comment on opinion polls, I only comment on the prospects of success, and they are very very good."</p>

      <p>As Ms Thorp jumped on Labour's battlebus, Mr Corbyn backed her No1 plea to revive seaside towns - slapping new regulations on cramped, unfit 'houses of multiple occupancy'.</p>
      <p>She said: "B&amp;Bs are owned by private landlords, who often live offshore and aren’t aware of the conditions their tenants are living in.</p>
      <p>"I visited one weeks ago and we weren’t even allowed to walk all the way inside it because it wasn’t deemed safe enough."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn - whose party is carrying out a 'policy review' of seaside towns - also suggested Victorian resorts could be revived with new arts projects and funds from offshore wind farms.</p>
      <p>But as the pair chatted, Mr Corbyn admitted he's more of an EastEnders fan.</p>
      <p>"Sorry, I’ve got to be honest about it," he said. "I watch EastEnders and I find it so bizarre I actually enjoy it.</p>
      <p>"There cannot be such a crime-ridden place in the country that hasn’t had a collective ASBO yet."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn would not confirm if Labour will keep its 2017 vow to end free movement for EU citizens after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>

      <p>He said "ask me after Saturday" - when Labour's factions agree the manifesto.</p>
      <p>But signalling a far softer approach than the Tories, he said: "We depend on a lot of European workers in this country.</p>
      <p>"And a lot of British people depend on being able to work and travel in Europe. I don’t want to take those opportunities away from either group."</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn also claimed Ian Byrne - who shared expletive-filled online posts - had "changed".</p>
      <p>Labour's ruling NEC kept the West Derby candidate despite outcry from some members about the posts, which called bra tycoon Michelle Mone a "c***" and Tory Esther McVey a "b******".</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said the remarks were "disgusting and disgraceful and totally unacceptable" - but the decision was for the NEC.</p>
      <p>He told the Mirror: "My personal view is that he’s explained what went on, explained in the context and the attitude he had at that time in his life, and I hope and believe that he has very much changed his personality and his approach.</p>
      <p>"And I want people to be educated to get away from that kind of disgusting misogynistic language that he’s put forward."</p>

      <p>Ms Thorp became a Labour backer after failing to vote in 2010 because of "anger and confusion and misrepresentation".</p>
      <p>Now she lives on a houseboat so doesn't have a legal postal address.</p>
      <p>Instead she has to cast her vote in her hometown, where her dad Geoff, 61, mum Jan, 61, and brother Dave, 29, run a factory making Blackpool rock.</p>

      <p>She spoke to the Mirror two weeks after opening up about life with Borderline Personality Disorder in a bid to help others.</p>
      <p>She told us she was wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder and "heavily medicated" in 2012 before finally being diagnosed last year.</p>
      <p>"I thought I was going crazy," she said. "It was through that diagnosis and being linked with other people with similar diagnoses that I felt normal again and felt like I was in control of it again."</p>
