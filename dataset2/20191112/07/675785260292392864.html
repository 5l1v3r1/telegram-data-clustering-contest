      <h1>I'm A Celebrity fans confused over 'missing' campmate as Corrie star not on line-up</h1>
      <h2>I'm A Celebrity viewers learned the 2019 line-up on Monday, but Coronation Street's Kirk actor Andrew Whyment was 'missing'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:52:41+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>Coronation Street viewers were left devastated after it appeared a rumoured I'm A Celebrity 2019 star was not on the line-up after all.</p>
      <p>Corrie's Kirk Sutherland actor Andrew Whyment was hotly tipped to enter the jungle on the ITV series next weekend.</p>
      <p>But as the line-up was confirmed ahead of the start date, the fan favourite did not appear.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa, Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright and Nadine Coyle are among the stars joining hosts Ant and Dec on the show.</p>
      <p>Also heading into camp are Roman Kemp, Kate Garraway and Myles Stephenson.</p>

      <p>But someone it appears won't be entering the jungle is Andrew, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> fans pretty gutted.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement of who is going in, viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to question his whereabouts.</p>
      <p>One fan commented: "GUTTED...WHERE IS KIRK FROM CORRIE."</p>

      <p>Another confused fan said: "All these tweets about Kirk and Caitlyn Jenner and Kirk ain’t even going in the f**ker. Devastated."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "I’m genuinely upset that Kirk from corrie isn’t going."</p>
      <p>This was echoed by another viewer who said: "Kind of devastated Kirk from Corrie isn’t going in."</p>

      <p>There are usually two late runners on the show each year, so perhaps this will see Andrew enter the jungle.</p>
      <p>Fans are certainly hoping so, believing he will bring some humour to the show.</p>
      <p>One fan commented: "I will protest if we don’t get Kirk from Corrie in the jungle this year as a late entrant."</p>
