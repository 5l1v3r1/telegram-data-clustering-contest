      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco is halving the price of starter kits for its Ploom S reduced-risk cigarettes, as it struggles to compete against rival Philip Morris International.</p>
      <p>Japan is the world’s biggest market for “heat not burn” products, which emit less smoke than conventional cigarettes, as regular e-cigarettes with liquid nicotine are banned.</p>
      <p>From Dec. 1, the recommended retail price of the kit, including the smoking device which heats tobacco sticks, micro USB cable and AC adapter, will be 3,480 yen ($31.90) from 7,980 yen, Japan Tobacco said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In October, the company said fewer people than it expected were trying out and switching to Ploom S, amid strong competition from Philip Morris’ IQOS, cutting its annual profit outlook.</p>
      <p>The company said it now expected full-year operating profit of 505 billion yen, down from a previous forecast of 518 billion. For the third quarter, operating profit fell 26% on the year, to 129 billion yen.</p>
