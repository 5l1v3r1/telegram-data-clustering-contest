      <p>The order comes a day after the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) recommended the closure of several roads surrounding the Rizal Memorial Coliseum, where some games will be held. The Coliseum is a stone’s throw from DLSU’s campus in Malate.</p>
      <p>Games <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1188852/dlsu-manila-suspends-classes-work-from-dec-2-to-7-for-upcoming-sea-games">will also be held</a> in other venues in Metro Manila, such as the Cuneta Astrodome, the World Trade Center, the SM Mall of Asia skating rink and arena in Pasay City, the SM Megamall ice skating rink in Mandaluyong City, the Filoil Flying V Centre in San Juan City, and the Muntinlupa City Sports Complex.</p>
      <p>Almost 10,000 athletes are expected to participate in the biennial games, which were first held in 1959 in Bangkok. <a href="https://2019seagames.com/sports.html">Athletes will compete in sports</a> like Filipino fave basketball, volleyball, archery, golf, and even e-sports.</p>
