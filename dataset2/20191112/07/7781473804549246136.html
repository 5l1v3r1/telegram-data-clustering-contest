      <h1>Audi Q8 flagship SUV to be launched in India on January 15, 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:29:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:29</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/q8-m788/">Audi Q8</a>, German car maker's flagship SUV will debut in the Indian market on January 15, 2020, confirmed Balbir Dhillon, head of Audi India, in an interview with PTI.</p>
      <p>The Audi Q8 sits above the Q7 in the line-up and sports an SUV-Coupe like stance as opposed to the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/q7-m17/">Audi Q7</a>'s more upright proportions. The Q8 will be the first SUV from Audi to sport the new family design which will then be seen on the updated Q7 and India bound 2020 <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/q3-m15/">Audi Q3</a>. Other features that enhance its blend of SUV-Coupe body style are the sloping roofline and frameless doors.</p>

      <p>The cabin features a dashboard layout inspired from the Audi A8 sedan. The Q8 will be the second Audi to boast a dual touch-screen centre console that we saw in the recently launched <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/a6-m12/">Audi A6</a>. Speaking of the dual-screen centre console, the Q8 gets a 10.1-inch infotainment system.</p>

      <p>Audi is most likely to bring in the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/q8/55-tfsi-v8276/">Q8 55 TFSI</a> <a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/audi-q8-55-tfsi-first-drive-review/">that we drove earlier this year and you can read the first drive review here</a>. The Q8 is based on the MLB Evo platform that also underpins the Audi SQ7, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/porsche/cayenne-m130/">Porsche Cayenne</a> and <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/bentley/bentayga-m509/">Bentley Bentayga</a>. Powering the 55 TFSI trim is a 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine that has an output of 340PS and 500Nm of torque - also, the engine is most likely to be in a BSVI state of tune. <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/audi-india-to-follow-petrol-only-strategy-in-the-bsvi-era/">Given that Audi is mainly focusing on the petrol drivetrains for India</a> it is unlikely the 50 TDI trim will be offered in our market.</p>

      <p>The Audi Q8 will be brought in the country via the CBU route that could translate in an ex-showroom cost of over Rs 1 crore. The Audi Q8 will rival the likes of Bentley Bentayaga, Porsche Cayenne and the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/lamborghini/urus-m626/">Lamborghini Urus</a>.</p>
