      <p>PUNTA GORDA, Fla. -- Allegiant is adding a new route in and out of <a href="https://www.flypgd.com/">Punta Gorda Airport</a> next year.</p>
      <p>The airline has announced that starting in February they will have non-stop flights going to and from Richmond, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Richmond is about 2 hours south of Washington D.C.</p>
      <p>Allegiant says the new route will open up on Valentine's Day, and will run every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
      <p>They say the route will be seasonal, meaning it will only run part of the year. But they didn't say when it will end.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.allegiantair.com/">Introductory fares</a> begin as low as $65 each way.</p>
      <p>Allegiant says the new route will bring about 15,000 new travelers to Charlotte County.</p>
