      <p>A silver bullet hits shipping, killing everything on its’ path, in form of new research commissioned by campaign groups Seas At Risk and Transport and Environment.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Speed reduction is the closest thing to a silver bullet the IMO will ever see,” said Seas at Risk’s senior policy advisor John Maggs. “We’ve got a win from a climate point of view, we’ve got a win from a human health point of view, we’ve got a win for marine nature, we’ve got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money.”</i>

      <p>Well, some research, I’d say! it’s much more of a demolition ball, used for dismantling old buildings, than of silver bullet. The whole “research” is your typical UN stuff. 49 pages of impossible to read mumbo-jumbo, called to prove the validity of speed reduction, and countless benefits it will bring. The most important issue is of course, CO2 emission reduction. The most important issue was substantiated by less than one page of a text, including a table. Out of total 49. According to table and text, 20% speed reduction will reduce CO2 emission by 24%.<br/>Here’s one small problem, though – if there’s a regular line with rigid schedule and cargo volume (say, coal for power plant), reduced speed will require extra tonnage, and with that, CO2 emission will be reduced by 10% most, do your math.</p>
      <p>It will of course, lead to hike in transportation costs, it will severely disrupt logistics chains, it will wreck a havoc – just think about some goods requiring speedy and timely delivery, such as pharmaceutical materials, private goods, etc. Again, as in case with Sulphur Cap, it will hit us all, not industry only. It’s a shot with global consequences.<br/>With that said, we have to keep in mind, that there’s no man-made global warming and that the CO2 gas is not a pollutant, and never was. CO2 is as vital for life, as oxygen.</p>
      <p>As for other goals to be hit by a magic bullet, such as collisions with whale or noise reduction, all of them can be characterized as a pure silver lunacy. The ships trading the globe, are, according to all latest “studies” and researchers”, nothing but Death Stars from Star Wars movies. They kill everything they contact. Bacteria are dying, flees and mosquito are mercilessly killed by crews, unknown marine species are killed by ship’s hull, propeller and movement – shipping in short, is a sailing ecological disaster. Thank God we have sharpshooters firing silver bullets, and the IMO. IMO isn’t about shipping, by the way, IMO is all about destroying shipping.<br/>Advise “campaign groups”, NGOs and IMO a final, golden bullet – ban them all, all motor ships, I mean. Leave afloat just some minimal number required for supplying elites with goods, which are necessary for them to keep their struggle for Mother Nature and Rescue Planet Quest. Such goods as you know, luxury cars and furniture, fuel to keep them warm and moving around in jets and mega yachts, caviar, beef and avocados, so on and so forth.</p>
      <p>Of course they won’t fire a final shot using golden bullet, you know why? Take for example, lice or bloodsucking bed-bugs – they don’t kill living organism on which they parasite, instantly. They eat it live, and proliferate in the process, speeding up inevitable death of their only source of food they have. they don’t infect organism with the purpose of killing it, but with the purpose of feeding from it, here and now. They can’t think ahead, they indeed, can’t think at all. They can only eat and proliferate.</p>
