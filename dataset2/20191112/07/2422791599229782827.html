      <h1>Sean Spicer eliminated from 'Dancing with the Stars'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Stelter, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Maybe Sean Spicer was exactly what ABC's "<a href="https://abc.com/shows/dancing-with-the-stars">Dancing With the Stars</a>" needed: A boldface name, beloved by some, detested by others, who stirred interest in the 28th season of the reality TV workhorse.</p>
      <p>Spicer capitalized on his former role as White House press secretary by doing the tango and the foxtrot for millions of ABC viewers. His former boss President Donald<b> </b>Trump seemed to take the competition seriously, tweeting out support for Spicer and urging the MAGA universe to cast votes for a man who has remained loyal during a perilous time for the president.</p>
      <p>But every dance party ends eventually.</p>
      <p>Spicer's party ended on Monday night when the "Dancing" judges decided to eliminate him from the reality TV competition.</p>
      <p>Frankly, the surprise is that Spicer lasted this long, in the face of persistently low scores from the judges. It seemed like he received a significant boost, week after week, from Trump supporters who swarmed ABC with votes.</p>
      <p>He urged red state America to stand with him â€” and his allies cast the whole thing as an example of the culture war. Multiple segments on Fox News celebrated Spicer's performance and promoted his continued involvement on the show.</p>
      <p>At the same time, some loyal "Dancing" viewers were flummoxed by his success to date and frustrated by his entrance into the quarterfinals. They expressed their concerns on social media, <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a29715894/dancing-with-the-stars-2019-sean-spicer-vote-results-reaction/">according to Good Housekeeping</a>.</p>
      <p>At 8:33 p.m. on Monday, during the show's live airing on the East Coast, Trump tweeted and urged people to "vote for Sean."</p>
      <p>Trump wrote, "He is a great and very loyal guy who is working very hard."</p>
      <p>But after Spicer was voted off the show, Trump quickly deleted that message and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194089337887109126">posted a new one</a>: "A great try by @seanspicer. We are all proud of you!"</p>
      <p>"Thank you," Spicer <a href="https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/1194104561906126848">replied</a> a little later in the evening. "I can't begin express how much I appreciate your continued support, especially throughout my time on @DancingABC."</p>
      <p>Spicer thanked everyone who voted for him "over the past 9 weeks." He said he had a blast.</p>
      <p>The president's two dozen other tweets and retweets on Monday were mostly about the House's impeachment inquiry that has thrown the future of his term into doubt.</p>
