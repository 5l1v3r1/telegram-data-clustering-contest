        <b>Former Australia batsman Mike Hussey believes that Babar Azam will be considered among the best in the world, in the league of the ‘Fab Four’, if he scores a few big Test hundreds. Babar is already one of the best when it comes to limited-overs but is yet to replicate the same in the longest format.</b>

      <p>Babar scored an impressive 157 not out on day 1 of the practice game, ahead of the two-match Test series between Pakistan and Australia. Meanwhile, Asad Shafiq scored a brilliant unbeaten 119. After witnessing the heroics, the veteran Australia batsman stated that Pakistan’s limited-overs captain is as brilliant a player as <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kane_williamson">Kane Williamson</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steve_smith">Steve Smith</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/joe_root">Joe Root</a>. Addressing the elephant in the room, Hussey pointed out what exactly will make Babar walk into the same league as his idol. </p>
      <p>"If Babar Azam can start hitting some big hundreds in Tests, he can be in that same conversation when we talk about the best players in the world, like Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, Kane Williamson and Joe Root. He's that good, he's a brilliant player," Hussey, who is a part of the Australian coaching staff, was quoted as saying by PakPassion.</p>
      <p>While Australia won the preceding T20I series by 2-0, the Test battle starts on November 21 at the Gabba in Brisbane. </p>
