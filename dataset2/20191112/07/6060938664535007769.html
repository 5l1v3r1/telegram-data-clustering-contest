      <p>LAHORE: Following India's emphatic victory over Bangladesh in the recently-concluded T20I series, former Pakistan speedster <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shoaib-Akhtar">Shoaib Akhtar</a> feels the Men in Blue are on another level at the moment and stand a good chance of winning next year's World T20 in Australia.</p>
      <p>India, who were trailing 0-1 against Bangladesh following their defeat in New Delhi, came out with commanding performances in the next two games to take the three-match rubber 2-1.</p>
      <p>"India have proved who the boss is in the match. Though India lost the first game but made a clinical comeback in the series, courtesy <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>'s scintillating batting display," Akhtar said in a video posted on his Youtube channel while mentioning Rohit's brilliant 85 in Rajkot.</p>
      <p>"Rohit is a great talent, he can score runs any time he wants," Akhtar added.</p>
      <p>India, riding on great performances from KL Rahul, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shreyas-Iyer">Shreyas Iyer</a>, Shivam Dube and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a>, won the third and final T20I by 30 runs in Nagpur.</p>
      <p>"I thought 3rd T20I will be exciting to watch. However, India came out as a much better side, but hats off to Bangladesh for their spirited performance," said Akhtar.</p>
      <p>Chasing 175, Bangladesh were bundled out for 144 in the final T20I.</p>
      <p>"Bangladesh is no ordinary side, we all must remember that the Tigers are not going to choke in front of any team," Akhtar said.</p>
      <p>The former Pakistan pacer also praised Deepak, who became the first Indian male cricketer to pick up a T20I hat-trick. In fact, his figures of 6/7 are now the best in history of T20 internationals.</p>
      <p>"He (Deepak) is a mix of medium pace and seam and he displayed a commendable performance by taking a hat-trick in the game," he said.</p>
