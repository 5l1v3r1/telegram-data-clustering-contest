      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Raheem_Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> will not be considered for selection in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-0">England’s</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifier against Montenegro after a row with team-mate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/joe-gomez">Joe Gomez</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> players were on opposite sides of Sunday’s top-of-the-table Premier League clash at Anfield, which Sterling’s City lost 3-1.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez clashed briefly towards the end of the game and tensions had not eased on Monday when they reported for international duty at St George’s Park.</p>
      <p>The Football Association confirmed late on Monday night that due to ”a disturbance in a private team area”, Sterling would sit out of Thursday’s game.</p>
      <p>Sterling will remain with the squad and could play in England’s final qualifier against Kosovo on Sunday but will play no part against Montenegro. </p>
      <p>“We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday,” said Gareth Southgate, the England manager.</p>
      <p>“One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we’ve been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately the emotions of yesterday’s game were still raw.</p>
      <p>“My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken. Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it’s important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night.”</p>
