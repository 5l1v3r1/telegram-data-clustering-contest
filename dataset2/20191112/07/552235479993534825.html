      <h1>Charlie Nicholas responds to Rod Stewart's Celtic prediction pop as he delivers Rangers one-liner</h1>
      <h2>Sir Rod had a pop at the former Celtic star but the pundit is hoping the pair can rekindle their friendship.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:54:58+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Surprised Charlie Nicholas admits he was caught on the hop after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rod-stewart">Rod Stewart</a> took him to task over his Lazio vs Celtic prediction.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old is known for going against Scottish sides away from home in Europe and he didn't see the Hoops' storied win in the Stadio Olimpico coming after tipping the Italians.</p>
      <p><i><b>Hotline</b> </i>regular Sir Rod then called in on Friday to tell Nicholas he "should know better" than to bet against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's side.</p>
      <p>And now Nicholas is looking to mend fences with the legendary crooner who was in Rome to enjoy one the club's thrilling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> triumph.</p>

      <p>That victory has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in the knockouts with two games to spare with Lennon and his players earning widespread acclaim for their display.</p>
      <p>But Nicholas insists he remains a big fan of the 74-year-old but has joked Stewart's Greatest Hits collections might no longer be on repeat.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>He said in his <i><b>Daily Express</b> </i>column: "I had a little bit of a chuckle when Sir Rod Stewart had a pop at me last week.</p>
      <p>"Rod was unhappy with me for saying that I didn't expect Celtic to win away to Lazio.</p>
      <p>"I hold my hands up and admit I got it wrong, because Celtic produced a great performance on the night.</p>

      <p>"I also got the Rangers result wrong but I didn't see Rod having a go at me for that one!</p>
      <p>"In all seriousness, I haven't seen Rod for years, but he is a great friend and always will be.</p>
      <p>"I am in the business to give my opinion and I know people will have a pop back.</p>
      <p>"I am more than happy to take things on the chin - whatever one they want to pick!</p>
      <p>"So, while I might not be singing Baby Jane as much as I used to, I still love Rod."</p>
