        <b>Dessers ramps up Eagles reminder</b>
      </p>
      <p>Belgium-born Cyriel Dessers has a Nigerian mother and the 24-year-old has indicated he is ready to switch nationalities.</p>
      <p>His three goals last weekend would have caught Gernot Rohr’s attention. Dessers scored in the 56th, 64th and 82nd minutes to lead Heracles Almelo to a 6-1 win over VVV Venlo.</p>
      <p>The three-goal salvo takes his goals tally to eight in 13 league appearances. Heracles are seventh on the table with 21 points from 13 matches.</p>

        <b>Ejuke nets another double</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another striker plying his trade in the Dutch Eredivisie, Chijioke Ejuke, scored another double to help Heerenveen come back from a goal deficit to record a 2-1 win over Sparta Rotterdam.</p>
      <p>It was a quick-fire double for the 21-year-old in the 73rd and 79th minutes – goals that were all his own making from the left flank.</p>

      <p>It was Ejuke’s sixth league goal in what has been a very fruitful campaign. Heerenveen are joint seventh on the table with 21 points. Ejuke has scored 30 per cent of the goals his side has scored in the Eredivisie.</p>

        <b>Aribo nets first league goal</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joe Aribo got a much-coveted league goal as Rangers beat Livingstone 2-0 away to stay joint top with Celtic, on 31 points from 12 matches.</p>
      <p>Aribo, 23, opened the goals account in the 32nd minute with a one-touch shot that flew past the goalkeeper. The midfielder has scored two goals for the Super Eagles in his two matches – against Ukraine and Brazil.</p>
