      <h3>Why it is interesting</h3>
      <p>Premier Foods is in the middle of conducting a strategic review of the business, which it said today is near completion. </p>
      <p>Chief executive Alex Whitehouse used the publication of his first set of results in charge of the business to announce three new roles on the executive leadership team; chief customer officer, chief marketing officer and operations director.</p>
      <p>The restructuring has led to the removal of the UK managing director and international managing director roles, he said.</p>
      <p>The company said it is continuing to target cost savings in the next two years, and is “starting to see options regarding its future cash deployment”. </p>

      <h3>What Premier Foods said</h3>
      <blockquote>Chief executive Alex Whitehouse said: ““In presenting my first set of results as CEO of Premier Foods I’m encouraged by our strong start to the year with total revenue up 2.4 per cent and branded revenue ahead 4.3 per cent. <br/><br/>“Our biggest brand, Mr Kipling, has continued its momentum from last year, with sales growth of eight per cent while sales of our Nissin branded ranges have more than doubled. <br/><br/>We have launched a number of new product ranges including our new plant-based brand Plantastic and our international business returned to growth in the second quarter. Due to our strong cash generation, our net debt has reduced by £38.8m compared to the same point last year.<br/><br/>“I am also announcing a new executive leadership team structure which provides us with sharper consumer, customer and operational focus. Our operational strategy is unchanged, but we now have increased energy and impetus. <br/><br/>“We are targeting some largely operational cost savings over the next two years and we are on track to meet our Net debt/EBITDA target of 3.0x by the end of this financial year. <br/><br/>“With a better first half than planned, we are confident in our expectations for progress in the full year. As we look a little further ahead, and in light of our disciplined and consistent track record of net debt reduction, we start to see options for our future deployment of cash.”</blockquote>
