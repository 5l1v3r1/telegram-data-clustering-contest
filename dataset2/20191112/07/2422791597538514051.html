      <p>Hilaria Baldwin shared her grief on Instagram Monday over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/09/entertainment/hilaria-baldwin-miscarriage-taboos/index.html">her second miscarriage</a> this year.</p>
      <p>"We are very sad to share that today we learned that our baby passed away at 4 months. We also want you to know that even though we are not ok right now, we will be," Baldwin wrote in the caption of a video she shared of her<b> </b>and her daughter.</p>
      <p>In the video, Baldwin's daughter, Carmen, hugs her mother and kisses her cheek as Baldwin thanks her for saying she was sorry that her mom was sad.</p>
      <p>Baldwin has been open about the joys and struggles of her pregnancies in the past. In April, Baldwin confirmed that she had experienced a miscarriage, saying that she wanted to share more than just the happy moments.</p>
      <p>"I have no shame or embarrassment with this experience," Baldwin wrote in an April Instagram post. "I want to be a part of the effort to normalize miscarriage and remove the stigma from it. There is so much secrecy during the first trimester."</p>
      <p>Baldwin has four children with actor Alec Baldwin: their daughter and three boys. She had shared a video in October of the couple revealing to their children that the new baby was a girl.</p>
      <p>"I told [Carmen] that this baby isn't going to come after all...but we will try very hard to give her a little sister another time," Baldwin wrote.</p>
