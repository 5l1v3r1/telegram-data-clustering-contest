      <h1>Alex Trebek chokes up on 'Jeopardy!' after contestant's heartfelt message</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:37:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:37</time> by <a rel="author">Amir Vera, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Dhruv Gaur's answer on "Jeopardy!" brought host Alex Trebek to tears Monday.</p>
      <p>During the "Final Jeopardy" round, Trebek asked contestants for their answers. When he got to Gaur, the host paused, according to <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/we-love-you-alex-alex-trebek-gets-choked-up-at-jeopardy-contestants-answer/29765547#">CNN affiliate WBAL-TV</a></p>
      <p>"We love you Alex!" Gaur wrote on his answer, worth $1,995. In place of the word love, Gaur wrote a heart.</p>
      <p>"That's very kind of you, thank you," Trebek said, choking up. The "wrong" answer cost left Gaur with $5.</p>
      <p>Right before Gaur's message, Trebek shared he was reentering treatment for pancreatic cancer, Gaur tweeted. Trebek <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/06/entertainment/alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer/index.html">announced his diagnosis in March</a>.</p>
      <p>"We were all hurting for him so badly," Gaur tweeted. "When Final Jeopardy came up, I could've tried to puzzle it together, but really, just kept thinking about Alex."</p>
      <p>Gaur was glad he got to say "what everybody at the tournament was thinking."</p>
      <p>The other contestants announced last week they're <a href="https://twitter.com/ask_Steven/status/1191511713461547009?s=20">organizing a charitable play-along</a> as well to raise money for pancreatic cancer research.</p>
      <p>Since announcing the diagnosis, Trebek has worked to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/entertainment/alex-trebek-cancer-psa/index.html">raise awareness</a> about the disease.</p>
      <p>He teamed up with the World Pancreatic Cancer Coalition to make a video last month encouraging people to wear purple in November and help spread the word about the disease and its symptoms on social media.</p>
      <p>Pancreatic cancer is often deadly and goes undiagnosed until late stages.</p>
