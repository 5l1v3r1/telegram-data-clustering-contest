        <b>Global T20 Superstar AB de Villiers has confirmed that he will skip the forthcoming season of the Pakistan Super League in order to manage his workload. The 35-year-old has been keen on managing his workload efficiently and will also only feature in the second half of the BBL, post Christmas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In what comes as a major blow for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) ahead of the 2020 edition, the league will be without the services of swashbuckling South African T20 superstar <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ab_de_villiers">AB de Villiers</a>, who has decided to skip the tournament to manage his workload better. The veteran batsman is currently in South Africa to play in the Mzansi Super League for Tshwane Spartans, after which he will turn out for Brisbane Heat in the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/big_bash_league">Big Bash League</a> (BBL), but will not be featuring in 2020 edition of PSL.</p>
      <p>"Just managing workload. On-off as much as possible," said de Villiers, as quoted by News18, when asked about the reason for him skipping the forthcoming PSL edition. </p>
      <p>De Villiers featured for Lahore Qalandars in the 2018/19 edition of the tournament, scoring 218 runs at an average of 54.50 in the seven innings he played. He, however, missed the subsequent knockout matches that were played in Pakistan due to a back injury. De Villiers' next venture will be in Australia, post-Christmas, where he'll be playing for the Queensland-based franchise Brisbane Heat. </p>
