      <p>One of the most celebrated films of Indian cinema, '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Baazigar">Baazigar</a>' today completed successful 26 years of its release and how. Its been 26 years and the film is still fresh in minds and can be watched over and again by all. Today as the film completed a milestone, the leading lady of the film, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> shared a quirky video on her Instagram handle.</p>
      <p>In the boomerang video, we can see, Kajol winking her left eye on the tunes of 'Yeh Kaali Kaali Aankhein' (one of the famous songs from the film). She captioned the video in a witty way. She wrote, "Oops! still donâ€™t have black eyes ðŸ‘€ ðŸ˜‹#26YearsOfBaazigar." Dressed in a black dress with the black nail paints, Kajol is all in 'kaali kaali aankhein' mood. As soon as the actress shared this video on her social handles, fans showered wishes for the film's team and also complimented her for looking gorgeous and fresh like always.</p>
