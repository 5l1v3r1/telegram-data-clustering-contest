      <p>Congress leader Digvijay Singh has asked BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy to expose those who, according to him, conspired against the listing of Babri Masjid-Ram Temple case in the Supreme Court for seven years. This was after Swamy posted a cryptic tweet implying that many within his own party may have conspired to stop the listing of the Ayodhya dispute case in the Supreme Court.</p>

      <p>Swamy’s tweet read, “All those who now want to claim credit for the Ram Temple case should explain what they did from 2010 to 2017 to get the hearing the matter dates and matter listed? Zamindars can collect the crop revenue without planting the seeds.”</p>

      <p>While Swamy did not name anyone, many felt that he was targetting leaders from his own party, who were taking credit for the favourable verdict in the Ayodhya case by the Supreme Court. Congress leader Digvijay Singh asked Swamy to expose them by making their names public. Singh wrote, “Subramanian Swamy ji would you please be kind to come out with names to expose them? ”</p>

      <p>The Supreme Court on Saturday had decided the hand over the control of the disputed land to Hindus asking the government to construct a temple by setting up a trust in Ayodhya. Muslims, according to the Supreme Court, should be given five acres of land at an ‘alternate’ place to construct a mosque.</p>
