      <h1>2020 Hyundai Elite i20 hatchback to have all-digital instrument cluster</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:11:40+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:11</time> by <a rel="author">Aditya Jadhav  </a></address>
      <p>Spy pictures of the 2020 <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/elite-i20-m334/">Hyundai Elite i20</a> (Or just i20 in some international markets) give us a hint that the Korean manufacturer is updating its popular hatchback with premium features. The test mule of the 2020 Hyundai i20 spotted in the international market reveals that the next update could offer an all-digital instrument cluster in the hatchback. The all-digital instrument cluster could be limited to the top-trims of the hatchback and the lower trims could still be offered with conventional dials and gauges. Along with the instrument cluster, the in-car entertainment system could be offered with an up-to-date user interface.</p>

      <p>The exterior will see styling tweaks and bring the design more in line with the current <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/elantra-m62/">Hyundai Elantra</a> on sale in the Indian market. The angularly styled headlamp peeks out of the camouflage which appears to be an all-LED unit. The tail lamp assembly also sports revised styling cues.</p>

      <p>The 2020 hatchback could see the drivetrain options similar to the current car on sale in India. The 1.2-litre petrol and the 1.4-litre diesel engine could be carried over to the 2020 model year hatchback, however, this time the engines could be updated to the BSVI norms that will be set in the country come April 2020. The gearbox on offer will be the same 5-speed manual mated to the petrol engine and a 6-speed manual mated to the diesel powertrain. The petrol will be available with an optional automatic transmission.</p>

      <p>The update could ask a premium of Rs 40,000-50,000 over the prices of the current Hyundai Elite i20. Expect Hyundai to launch the 2020 model by Q2 next year and the prices could range from Rs 6-9.5 lakh, ex-showroom pan India. The 2020 Hyundai Elite i20 will continue to rivalry in the segment with the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/maruti-suzuki/baleno-m443/">Maruti Suzuki Baleno</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/toyota/glanza-m770/">Toyota Glanza</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/honda/jazz-m414/">Honda Jazz</a> and <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/volkswagen/polo-m172/">Volkswagen Polo</a>.</p>
