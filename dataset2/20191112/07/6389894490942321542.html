      <h1>Vodafone sees net debt rocket as it lowers dividend after €2bn loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:17:58+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:17</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Vodafone blamed an adverse Supreme Court judgement as it fell to a loss of almost €2bn in its latest half-year results today, as it lowered investors’ dividend and saw net debt spike.</p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p>Vodafone fell to a €1.89bn loss for the six months to the end of September.</p>
      <p>Group revenue ticked up 0.4 per cent to €21.94bn but free cash flow sank 94 per cent to just €34m, down from €566 this time last year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile net debt rocketed almost 50 per cent to €48.1bn.</p>
      <p>Investors were left nursing a loss per share of 7.24 cents. Though that was much lower than the 28.89 cents per share loss shareholders suffered this time last year.</p>
      <p>Vodafone also lowered its interim dividend to 4.50 cents per share, a seven per cent drop from 2018’s 4.84 cents per share.</p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>Vodafone’s share price has suffered a turbulent few months of trading since the telecoms firm slashed its dividend for the first time ever in May.</p>
      <p>The move came as Vodafone attempts to reduce its debt pile, which has been burdened by higher-than-expected 5G investment costs, as well as its $22bn takeover of Liberty Global’s assets in Germany and eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>The company will also be hoping to reverse its full-year loss of €7.6bn amid a squeeze on margins in the increasingly cut-throat telecoms sector.</p>
      <p>However, there have been some signs that Vodafone has made progress in its cost-cutting plans under group chief executive Nick Read.</p>
      <p>In July the firm’s shares were given a much-needed boost after it revealed plans to spin off its lucrative mobile masts business into a new independent company with potential earnings of €900m.</p>
      <p>Vodafone has also completed the sale of its New Zealand, and has announced a network-sharing agreement with Telecom Italia.</p>
      <p>Moreover, several recent deals have suggested Vodafone may be gaining ground against its rivals.</p>
      <p>Last week the firm signed a five-year deal for Virgin Mobile’s business from 2021, stealing it from rival BT, while Vodafone yesterday revealed plans to roll out full-fibre broadband in three new UK cities.</p>
      <h3>What Vodafone said</h3>
      <p>Chief executive Nick Read said:</p>
      <p>I am pleased by the speed at which we are executing on the strategic priorities that we announced this time last year. This is reflected in our return to top-line growth in the second quarter, which we expect to build upon in the second half of the year in both Europe and Africa.</p>
      <p>The consistency of our commercial performance has improved in both regions, and we have made a fast start on integrating the acquired Liberty Global businesses, where we see significant long-term opportunity.</p>
      <p>Our digital transformation is already creating a better experience for our customers, improving our differentiation,supporting growth and at the same time reducing our structural costs.</p>
      <p>We have now secured network sharing agreements across most of our major European markets, and we recently announced a major long-term wholesale partnership with Virgin Media in the UK, in order to improve the utilisation of our network assets.</p>
      <p>And we expect our European Tower company to be operational by May next year, enabling us to continue to unlock the significant value embedded in our tower infrastructure.</p>
