      <p>A man has stabbed three performers during a live show in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a>'s capital, state media said, adding that the victims were in stable condition.</p>
      <p>Footage broadcast by state television on Monday showed the man, identified as a 33-year-old Yemeni, running onto the stage in Riyadh's King Abdullah Park during a musical performance by what appeared to be a theatre troupe.</p>

      <p>State news agency SPA said the victims, two men and a woman, sustained "superficial wounds" and were stabilised after receiving medical care.</p>
      <p>A video tweeted by Al Ekhbariya appeared to show a man in street clothes rushing onto the stage towards a group of costumed performers and then falling to the ground as someone else chased him.</p>

      <p>Another online video showed the scene from another angle, as the assailant tumbled off the stage and the performers fled.</p>
      <p>The motive for the attack was not immediately clear.</p>
      <h3>International performances</h3>
      <p>King Abdullah Park is one of several venues hosting a two-month-long entertainment festival as part of government efforts to open up Saudi society and diversify its economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>The Riyadh Season festival's website said the offerings at the park include live shows and music, light installations, wall climbing and zip-lining.</p>
      <p>Crown Prince <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mohammed-bin-salman.html">Mohammed bin Salman</a>, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/pop-group-stand-decision-perform-saudi-arabia-191008115152327.html">eased social restrictions</a> and promoted entertainment previously banned in the conservative kingdom. The General Entertainment Authority has said it plans to pump $64bn into the sector in the coming decade</p>
      <p>But Saudi officials warn that introducing such reforms in a society steeped in conservatism is fraught with risk.</p>
      <p>While they are wildly popular among Saudi Arabia's majority young population, the reforms could anger arch-conservatives, including hardline religious leaders and the religious police whose powers have been clipped in recent years.</p>
      <p>"Liberals and conservatives in the kingdom are on a collision course and that probably worries Saudi leaders the most," Quentin de Pimodan, a Saudi expert at the Greece-based Research Institute for European and American Studies, told AFP news agency.</p>
      <p>"After this attack, we can expect a sharper crackdown on those opposed to Saudi's entertainment push."</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has faced international scrutiny over its human rights record since last year's murder of journalist <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/jamal-khashoggi.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a> by Saudi agents in Istanbul.</p>
