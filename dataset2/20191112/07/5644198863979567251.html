      <p>WASHINGTON: Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Monday (Nov 11) withdrew his request to join a lawsuit seeking a court ruling on whether witnesses must testify in the US House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, saying he would instead file his own case, according to a court document.</p>
      <p>Mulvaney had earlier sought to participate in a lawsuit filed by Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to ousted national security adviser John Bolton, seeking a court ruling on whether he should comply with a congressional subpoena or honor the Trump administration’s order not to testify.</p>
