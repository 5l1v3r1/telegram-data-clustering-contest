      <p>The festive season is finally here, which means for the next two months we can look forward to mulled wine, Christmas markets, and, of course, parties. Christmas celebrations are unlike any others throughout the year because sequins and sparkles are an absolute essential. So if you're looking for a way to jazz up your festive outfits in a fun but subtle way, look no further than hair embellishment. It's the beauty trend seen on catwalks and worn by celebrities, but now you can do it yourself. Below is a guide on <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/164897-13-ways-to-wear-hair-accessories-like-you-never-have-before-photos">how to do hair embellishment</a> and which products will work best.</p>
      <p>Hair embellishment is far from a new trend, as the style takes its inspo from the '90s, when <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-to-buy-90s-hair-clips-barrettes-because-theyre-back-more-extra-than-ever-12963580">hair accessories were all the rage</a>. Celebrities such as <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/lupita-nyongos-2018-oscars-look-is-peak-wakandan-goddess-8380240">Lupita Nyong'o</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi6mytYhhAE/">J Lo</a>, and <a href="https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/photo-gallery/44819365/image/44819355/Kerry-Washington-Met-Gala-2018-Photos">Kerry Washington</a> were rocking the the look back in 2018 but, more recently, Zazie Beetz stunned at the 5th Annual Through Her Lens workshop with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dDJSAAtfs/?utm_source=ig_embed">pearls dotted throughout her hair</a> and Alicia Keys gained more than 140,000 likes on a shot of her with diamanté <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B37fAnMg-XG/?utm_source=ig_embed">studs adorning her plait</a>. Now's the chance for you to create these looks for yourself.</p>
      <h3>1. Hair pins</h3>
      <p>If you're looking for a way to ease yourself into the hair embellishment trend, but you aren't quite ready to commit the time to putting individual gems in your hair, hair pins are a great place. You simply slide them onto your hair and you're off. So easy, yet so glam.</p>
