      <h1>House listing removed after suspicious photo of kitchen leaves buyers baffled</h1>
      <h2>The property listing received 29,000 views on the first day - but the boyfriend of the homeowner has now claimed the photo was a 'joke'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:33:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A home which was listed for sale online gained thousands of views in just a few days - for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>Not everyone taking a look was in the market for a new property and were instead drawn to the online advert after sharp-eyed house-hunters spotted something very suspicious in one of the photos.</p>
      <p>The listing on website Zillow, which gave an asking price of around £128,000, has since been taken down after it attracted 29,000 views on its first day and led to the homeowner being bombarded with inquiries.</p>
      <p>In among the photos of the home in Michigan was a snap of the spacious kitchen, showing wooden cabinets, granite worktops and an island in the middle.</p>

      <p>On the counter sits what appears to be a plate with five neat lines of a white powdery substance, as reported by <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/zillow-listing-of-home-goes-viral-after-photo-shows-white-powder-substance-drawn-in-lines">WXYZ</a> .</p>
      <p>Hundreds of viewers commented, with many saying it resembled cocaine, and even questioned if could land the current occupiers in hot water.</p>
      <p>However, the boyfriend of the homeowner came forward to claim the whole thing had been a joke.</p>
      <p>Talking to 7 Action News, the man known only as Jeff said: "I was like, I’m wondering if I did something like this if anybody would even notice or if somebody did notice it, that it would go viral and it went viral.</p>
      <p>“It went too viral.”</p>

      <p>Jeff said he created the scene by putting lines of headache powder on a plate but claims he took down the photo after it got 'way out of hand' as he was left fielding more than 100 calls, texts and emails.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was happy with the popularity of the listing, he said: "Yes and no."</p>
      <p>However, Zillow said it had been the one to remove the listing, with a spokesperson saying it had violated its 'Good Neighbour Policy'.</p>
      <p>A local police lieutenant said the force won't be carrying out an investigation into the image as 'there are too many legal questions to establish probable cause for a search warrant'.</p>
      <p>He added that even if it had been a stunt, he 'wouldn't recommend' anyone stages a scene like that to boost interest in a home listing.</p>
