      <h1>Aussie ‘E-Crime Squad’ arrests crypto exchange owner, seizing his Bitcoin ATM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:49:02+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>Australian detectives have arrested a 38-year-old man as part of an investigation into an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
      <p>The man, a resident in Cairnlea — a Melbourne suburb — <a href="https://www.police.vic.gov.au/man-arrested-part-cryptocurrency-investigation">was arrested</a> at home, where police seized “a substantial amount of cash and false identification documents.”</p>
      <p>Authorities also seized a cryptocurrency ATM from a shopping mall in nearby Braybrook, which according to Google Maps is approximately 8 kilometres away from Cairnlea.</p>
      <p>The investigation began in June after the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), a government financial intelligence agency tasked with monitoring transactions, provided intelligence regarding reports of scam activity linked to the ATM.</p>
      <p>It seems the man had been using the ATM to provide an unregistered cryptocurrency exchange service and continued to do so even after the AUSTRAC handed him with a cease and desist notice on November 1, 2018.</p>
      <p>It’s likely that Australian law enforcement is well versed with cryptocurrency scams.</p>
      <p>In fact, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said in August that victims in the country <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/13/cryptocurrency-scammers-conned-australians-out-of-14-8m-in-just-7-months/">lost a record  $14.76 million</a> to cryptocurrency investment scams between January and July this year.</p>
      <p>The same month, Australian police charged five individuals in connection with a protracted cold call cryptocurrency investment scam that <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/08/5-charged-in-connection-with-2-7m-australian-cryptocurrency-scam/">tricked more than 100 victims</a> into losing $2.7 million.</p>
      <p>In July, an Australian couple made headlines after they <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/07/19/australian-retired-couple-lose-900000-cryptocurrency-scam/">reportedly lost $900,000</a> to an elaborate scam.</p>
      <p>Potentially spurred on by the ongoing narrative about digital currencies and illicit behaviour, Australia is <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/06/australia-reportedly-wants-to-grill-facebook-about-its-cryptocurrency-plans/">reportedly scrutinizing Facebook</a> over its ‘cryptocurrency‘ plans.</p>
