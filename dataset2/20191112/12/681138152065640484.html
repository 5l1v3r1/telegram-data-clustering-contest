        <b>Lawyers have expressed delight after vying against law firms across the UK to be crowned best in the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ipswich-based Ashtons Legal - which employs 380 staff across offices in Bury St Edmunds, Norwich, Cambridge and Thetford - said it was "thrilled" after scooping the Law Firm of the Year title at the LawNet Awards 2019, held on November 8.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Ed O'Rourke said: "I am hugely proud of my team here at Ashtons - this award recognises everything they do to make this firm one that has stands out against our peers as the law firm of the year."</p>

Over the last few years, it has invested in IT and moved to new premises in Bury St Edmunds while embarking of a comprehensive modernisation programme in its other offices.</p>
      <p>LawNet boss Chris Marston said: "Ashtons' greatest achievement has been their people. Their collaborative and trusting environment was illustrated across the legal community when they deployed a paid time off policy in 2015 - a policy which has subsequently been copied by a number of other firms including those within the LawNet community.</p>
      <p>"The journey continues with an ever greater degree of flexible and agile working and outcome focused objectives."</p>
