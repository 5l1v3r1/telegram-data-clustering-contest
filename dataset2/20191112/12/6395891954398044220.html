      <p><b>VENICE, ItalyÂ (AP)</b> - Tourists and Venetians alike have donned high boots and taken to raised walkways to slosh through the high water that has hit much of the lagoon city.</p>
      <p>Venice's tide forecast office said the water level peaked at 1.27 meters (about 4 feet 3 inches) Tuesday morning but warned that an even higher tide was forecast for after nightfall.</p>
      <p>The high water invaded cafes and stores. As a precaution, authorities closed nursery schools.</p>
      <p>Many hotels keep disposable knee-high plastic boots handy for tourists. Venetians' wardrobes often include over-the-knee rubber boots.</p>
      <p>Bad weather has dogged Italy lately, with near-daily downpours drenching much of the country.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists predicted more heavy rain coming in late Tuesday, especially in the northeast, which includes Venice, as well as in Sicily and elsewhere in the south.</p>
