      <h1>Chhattisgarh govt claims job for over 500,000 created despite slowdown</h1>
      <h2>Lion's share of jobs generated in rural sector, through a slew of schemes aimed at creating self-employment and employment opportunities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:23:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">R Krishna Das</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh </a>government has claimed that it has created jobs for over 500,000 people across sectors over the past 10 months despite the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/economic-slowdown">economic slowdown </a>in the country.</p>
      <p>Data released by the state said that after the formation of the new government led by Bhupesh Baghel, some 541,259 people have got employment within a span of 10 months, that is, from January to October 2019. This includes 510,117 rural jobs, 20,502 in the government sector and 10,640 in industry.</p>
      <p>“The state government has launched Narva, Garva, Ghurva and Bari schemes for strengthening the rural economy and this has made a big difference,” a spokesperson said. Under these schemes, self-employment and employment opportunities were created for rural inhabitants.</p>
      <p>In the government sector, the state had filled vacant posts and conducted a new recruitment drive. In all, 20,502 people had been recruited in government offices.</p>
      <p>Similarly, 10,640 people have been absorbed in industry despite most major units underperforming due to a raw material crisis. The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh </a>government said the encouragement provided to industries in the state had led to significant progress in the industrial sector when the entire nation was going through a recession.</p>
      <p>The state had earlier bucked the trend and recorded impressive growth in the automobile sector at a time when industry across the country was passing through its worst crisis.</p>
