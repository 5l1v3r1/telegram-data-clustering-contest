      <h1>Sask. job numbers remain bright spot in troubled economy</h1>
      <h2>The province added 11,100 jobs over the 12 months ending October, but other economic data and forecasts don't look so rosy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:00:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Saskatchewan posted another month of year-on-year job growth in October, as <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/sask-party-may-ride-solid-jobs-to-a-2020-election-win">the province’s labour market remained relatively strong</a> despite sluggish growth forecasts, stubborn trade irritants and continued weakness in the energy sector.</p>
      <p>Statistics Canada’s labour force survey put Saskatchewan’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at just 5.1 per cent in October, down slightly from September and a full point lower than the same time last year.</p>
      <p>There were 586,300 people employed in Saskatchewan in October 2019. That’s actually down by a few hundred jobs from the month before. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/sask-s-lagging-job-growth-has-little-to-do-with-the-oil-economy">But it’s 11,100 more jobs than were reported the same time last year</a>.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Harrison, Saskatchewan’s minister of trade and export development, said that number shows the province continues to create employment despite “significant economic headwinds.”</p>
      <p>“We have seen job creation, on a year-to-year basis, for 15 consecutive months,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Harrison repeated an argument he’s made before: there’s no contradiction between the provincial government’s criticism of a “job-killing carbon tax” and the slow but steady upward trend in its employment numbers.</p>
      <p>Without the carbon backstop and other federal energy policies, he argued, there would be still more people employed.</p>
      <p>“We should be, and could be, doing significantly better on the economic front,” he said.</p>
      <p>Harrison reiterated that the energy sector has shed jobs while other industries pick up the slack. He blames Ottawa and a worldwide commodity price downturn.</p>
      <p>“If we had healthy commodity prices and if we were getting global prices for our commodities, we would be seeing significantly higher job creation,” Harrison said.</p>
      <p>Statistics Canada data show that <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/national/12500-direct-oil-and-gas-sector-jobs-could-be-lost-this-year-report/wcm/39292978-73ae-4bc9-b0c5-129e57cf8915">employment is down in the oil, gas and mining sector by about 4,200 jobs since 2015</a>. It’s stayed at roughly the same level over the past year.</p>
      <p>Other industries have also felt the pain. The construction sector has lost more than 10,000 jobs since 2015, and the trend hasn’t slowed. Over the past year, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/business/saskatchewan-construction-jobs-decline">construction employment is down by 4,200 jobs</a>.</p>
      <p>Retail trade, wholesale trade, and transportation and warehousing have also suffered since this time last year.</p>
      <p>Manufacturing saw an uptick of about 3,000 jobs year over year, while agriculture gained 3,600. Employment is also up in education, public administration and accommodation and food services.</p>
      <p>About 8,600 of the jobs created over the past year were part-time, while full-time employment went up by 2,500.</p>
      <p>Youth employment was up slightly, according to the Statistics Canada year-on-year numbers. Male and female employment both increased by similar amounts.</p>
      <p>But the comparatively strong labour market data is a rare bright spot in a still-cloudy economy. RBC recently cut its growth outlook for Saskatchewan’s growth rate for this year from 1.1 per cent to 0.6 per cent, pointing to the impact of China’s blockade of Canadian canola imports.</p>
      <p>“Saskatchewan, the province with the highest exposure to international trade, has the most at stake,” RBC said in its September forecast.</p>
      <p>TD Bank is forecasting GDP growth of 0.7 per cent for Saskatchewan this year, and predicted that hiring would slow down in 2020.</p>
      <p>“Facing challenging conditions in key commodity industries, Saskatchewan’s economy is set to deliver sub-par growth this year,” it said.</p>
      <p>Housing remains a sore point in the provincial economy. Statistics Canada data for building permits came out on the same day as the labour market survey, and it proved considerably less encouraging for Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>In September, the value of building permits declined 20.4 per cent relative to August on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
      <p>Compared to the same time last year, the value of building permits in Saskatchewan fell 28.3 per cent from $154 million in September 2018 to $110 million in September 2019.</p>
      <p>Harrison connected that to the energy downturn, saying construction has taken a hit “for the very same reasons.”</p>
