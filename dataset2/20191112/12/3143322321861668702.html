      <p>There are many things in life we cannot control, such as the weather, going bald and even the traffic. But there is one very important thing each of us can take responsibility for – looking after our health.</p>
      <p>Approximately thirty per cent of people with type 2 diabetes have already developed complications by the time they check for the disease.</p>

      <p>The risk of developing complications of diabetes can be reduced by regular health checks and adjusting elements of your lifestyle to avoid or delay the onset of diabetes.</p>

      <p>A change in diet to reduce the intake of refined carbohydrates, combined with regular exercise can lower your risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol.</p>
      <p>Remember, the earlier diabetes is diagnosed and treated the better. Diabetes complications are serious and include vascular diseases, such as heart attacks, stroke, blindness, limb amputations and kidney failure.</p>

      <p>In most cases, the development of such complications could have been avoided or delayed by early diagnosis and effective treatment.</p>
      <p>At a recent testing at Mediclinic Nelspruit, 360 members of the community were tested.  Whilst many people were on the higher side of the normal range, three people exceeded the acceptable range into double figures and were referred to their doctors for further investigation.</p>

      <p>Members of the community should consult with their local clinic, doctor or friendly pharmacy sister to do a blood glucose test, should they be concerned about diabetes.</p>
