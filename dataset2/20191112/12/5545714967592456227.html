      <p>The video game hardware company 8BitDo has been on a roll lately, and while its latest device is highly niche, it's also fascinating. The company is now selling <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-n30-24g-wireless-mouse">an NES-style wireless mouse</a> for PC and Mac.</p>

      <p>It's as if someone reached into a wormhole to pluck this out of an alternate reality.</p>
      <p>Modern tech aside, the 8BitDo N30 looks like a real product Nintendo could've made. I can picture it sitting in a Nintendo Entertainment System collection next to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Advantage">NES Advantage</a> and an <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/NES_Max">NES MAX</a>.</p>
      <p>The N30 was a collaboration with designer <a href="http://switchandlever.com/works/nes-mouse/">Daniel Jansson</a>, who's been pondering this "what if Nintendo tried making a mouse in the late-'80s?" scenario for years now. It has a functional D-pad (used for Page Up, Page Down, Forward, and Upward), a touch panel lurking in between the two oh-so-pressable red buttons, 1,000 Dpi, and an expected battery life of 100-120 hours on a single AA battery.</p>
      <p>If this speaks to you, just set aside $25 for the mouse and its included 2.4GHz receiver.</p>
