      <p>HONG KONG: The police is investigating an attempted murder after a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-man-set-on-fire-police-investigating-12082718">57-year-old man was set on fire</a> on Monday (Nov 11) in Hong Kong following a confrontation with protesters.</p>
      <p>Videos of the brutal attack, which went viral online, show a man in a green T-shirt arguing with people on a footbridge. A masked man dressed in black then throws a suspected flammable liquid over the man and sets him ablaze before fleeing.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong police said they received a report from a passer-by around 1pm on Tuesday about an argument between the man and protesters on a footbridge in the northern district of Ma On Shan.</p>
      <p>The man had multiple burn injuries and was admitted to a hospital in a critical condition, the police said, adding that investigations by the Commercial Crime Bureau are under way.</p>
      <p>Police spokesman John Tse told reporters on Monday that shortly before the attack, masked protesters had trashed the nearby MTR station and investigators believe the man “chased the rioters”.</p>
      <p>"Afterwards he was beaten up and set on fire," Tse said.</p>

      <p>What sparked the argument is unclear, but the expletive-laden conversation shows the man in green criticising people sympathetic to Hong Kong's protests, and his opponents berating him back.</p>
      <p>At one point the man in green can be heard saying "none of you are Chinese", to which the crowd responds with "we are HongKongers" and a string of vulgarities. </p>
      <p>One of his opponents shouts "Go back to the Greater Bay Area", the name for a nearby region of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The incident came during a tense day in Hong Kong, which has been engulfed for more than five months by increasingly violent protests.</p>
