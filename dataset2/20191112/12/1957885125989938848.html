      <p><b>News</b> by Imogen Beckhelling, Reporter Intern Updated on 12 November 2019</p>
      <p>The Apple VR and AR headsets seem like they're only a few years away, as a new report suggests the company is working on its very own gaming headset technology.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">Bloomberg</a>, Apple is making a combined VR and AR headset "with a focus on gaming, watching video and virtual meetings". It will supposedly be released between 2021 and 2022, with a "lightweight pair of AR glasses" coming in 2023.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg's sources told the publication Apple planned to have the technology ready for a VR headset as early as 2019, but decided to push it back - presumably to make space for the new iPad Pro set to release next year.</p>
      <p>"Engineering teams for the iPhone and iPad have begun work on connecting important applications and software features to a new operating system", Bloomberg reports. "Dubbed 'rOS' internally, it will let current devices work with the future headset and glasses."</p>
      <p>We reported last week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-04-valve-reportedly-working-with-apple-on-new-ar-head-mounted-display-devices">Apple had supposedly joined forces with Valve</a> to create "AR head-mounted display devices", though this new information suggests Apple are going it alone to create a potential competitor to Valve's headset.</p>
      <p>Apple has increasingly shown interest in the gaming side of things, what with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-21-apple-arcade-is-great-because-developers-have-steadily-made-ios-an-amazing-platform">the successful launch of Apple Arcade this year</a>, and rumours in the past of the company working on AR headsets.</p>
      <p>We don't know yet what games Apple plans on using its VR technology for, but there's no doubt it'll make a big fuss about it when anything gets announced in the future.</p>
