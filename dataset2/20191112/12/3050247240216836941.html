      <p>Ho Chi Minh City will develop a blockchain-oriented regulatory framework for the development of smart cities. </p>
      <p>Tran Vinh Tuyen, Vice Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh’s People's Committee, announced the news during the sixth annual international conference of Saigon High-Tech Park (SHTP), Viet Nam News <a href="https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/538200/blockchain-technology-vital-in-building-smart-city.html#aSqWuwGXphhTDwQT.97">reports</a> Nov. 11.</p>
      <p>At the same event, the SHTP, an incubator for high tech businesses, <a href="https://english.thesaigontimes.vn/72664/shtp-cuts-deal-with-s-korean-venture-fund-to-boost-blockchain-application.html">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding with South Korea’s CBA Ventures to promote the research and application of blockchain technology.</p>
      <p>Le Bich Loan, a senior exec at the Saigon Hi-Tech Park’s board of management, emphasized that blockchain tech has made financial transaction systems more efficient, transparent and easier to use in terms of online payments.</p>
      <h3>Ministry of Science and Technology prioritizes blockchain tech</h3>
      <p>According to Viet Nam News, the country’s Ministry of Science and Technology also announced plans to prioritize blockchain-focused startups within the <a href="http://en.dean844.most.gov.vn/">national program</a> "Supporting the National Innovation Initiative to 2025.”</p>
      <p>The program was <a href="http://en.dean844.most.gov.vn/about-us.htm">approved</a> by the Vietnamese government in May 2016 and aims to create favorable conditions for business development. The initiative provides support to 2,000 startups, according to the ministry’s website.</p>
      <h3>Smart cities and blockchain</h3>
      <p>The concept of a smart city <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/smart-cities-offer-promises-and-concerns-over-privacy">envisions</a> the use of emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence to improve the quality of municipal government services and citizen welfare. </p>
      <p>As a major technology that is expected to improve the transparency, speed and immutability of records, blockchain has been increasingly implemented in smart city projects globally.</p>
      <p>China recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-introduces-blockchain-based-identification-system-for-cities">introduced</a> a new blockchain-based city identification system on Nov. 4. In June 2019, Automotive giant China Wanxiang Holding <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wanxiang-and-platon-join-forces-for-blockchain-infrastructure-of-new-smart-city-in-china">partnered</a> with blockchain-based tech firm PlatOn to develop a smart city in Hangzhou.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a project at the University of Nevada, Reno <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/university-of-nevada-reno-develops-driverless-vehicle-blockchain-tech-with-iot-firm">announced</a> it was developing a new blockchain-based autonomous vehicle smart city project.</p>
