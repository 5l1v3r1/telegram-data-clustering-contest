      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Disney+ is down for some users.</li>
        <li>The service has only been live for a few hours.</li>
        <li>Reports across Twitter show users are having problems connecting to the service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Update</b> - A statement from Disney+ Help on Twitter has confirmed that demand for Disney+ is way above expectations, and that they are working to resolve the issue.</p>

      <p>Reports across Twitter suggest that Disney+ is down for some users. Multiple reports show users having problems trying to connect to the service.</p>
      <p>A displayed error message reads:</p>
      <blockquote>There seems to be an issue connecting to the Disney+ service. Please try again later if the issue persists.</blockquote>
      <p>It is unclear at this stage whether the issue is platform specific, or more likely, a problem with Disney+'s servers.</p>

      <p>Over on Reddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/dv930d/megathread_disney_down_server_unavailable/">megathread</a> has appeared dedicated to Disney+'s early issues. The thread has garnered over 250 comments in the last 2 hours with regards to service issues. Users are reporting issues on Android, iOS, Xbox and Fire Stick. Meanwhile, on <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/disney-plus/">Downdetector</a> there are thousands of reported outages. The scale and breadth of the problems seem to suggest this is definitely a Disney+ service issue, not tied to one specific platform.</p>
