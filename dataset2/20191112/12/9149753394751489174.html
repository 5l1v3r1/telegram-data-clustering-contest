      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog's new trailer is here, unveiling a more palatable version of Sonic that won't haunt your nightmares for the rest of your life. Gone are the human teeth—thank god—and the creepy, realistic nose and beady eyes. It's a big improvement.</p>

      <p>Originally due out this year, the reaction to the first trailer and Sonic's horrifying new look was so overwhelmingly negative that it was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-delayed-so-they-can-make-sonic-look-less-hellishly-weird/">delayed</a> until 2020 to give the studio time to redesign the blue monster.  </p>
      <p>Jim Carrey still looks like he should be tying women to railroad tracks, but it's not a look I'm entirely opposed to. At least he's not got hedgehog teeth. </p>
      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is due out in theatres on February 14. </p>
