      <h1>Glen Kamara earning Rangers top money is fantasy because he's absolutely bang average - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Fraser Wilson takes your calls as the battle at the top of the Premiership dominates the chat.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:52:01+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>The Premiership might be on a break for the next couple of weeks as the focus turns back to international football.</p>
      <p>But there’s no rest for fans of our top clubs as Celtic and Rangers continue to play a game of nip and tuck while in Edinburgh <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> step up their management searches.</p>
      <p>Starting at the top of the table where a single goal is all that separates Celtic and Rangers.</p>
      <p>First up, <b>Hugh Gallagher</b> emailed: “I couldn't stop laughing when I read the comment from Steve McSherry on the Hotline, he's saying he's disappointed at the lack of a challenge from Hibs, Hearts and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> and that Celtic need a challenge to keep them on their toes.</p>
      <p>“They didn't have any challenge whatsoever when Rangers weren't in the top flight so what kept them on their toes during that time?</p>

      <p>“It's only since Rangers returned that they've had to up their game, do you honestly believe they would have paid £9m for a player when Rangers weren't in the top flight? No chance.”</p>
      <p>But <b>John Scott, Grassmoor,</b> said: “ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> will have to achieve a damn sight more than take points off each other to win the league.</p>
      <p>“Livingston's win came out of the blue and there will be other points dropped between now and picking up the Premiership trophy in April.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“A rejuvenated Hibs, Hearts and Aberdeen are not going to roll over to either team no matter how much money and power they have. Don't count your chickens.”</p>
      <p>Happy Rangers fan <b>John Bruce</b> emailed: “On Sunday, Rangers showed that they are more than worthy of being joint top of the league on points, after again beating Celtic's victors Livingston at their home ground in a dominant display of skill over strength.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“Rangers played football rather than hardball and were happy to deal with stats rather than stitches after the game, with the headline being Alfredo Morelos scoring his 22nd goal of the season.</p>
      <p>“Morelos looks to be well on his way to scoring 30 goals before the turn of the year and a certain French forward may be asking Santa for Alfie's old boots for Christmas, as the Gallic goal-getter continues to play second fiddle to Rangers deadly dynamic duo.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Keith Jackson’s exclusive with Brendan Rodgers in <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>had the digital stats bursting through the roof.</p>
      <p><b>Stephen Mulhern, Dumbarton,</b> said: “I read Brendan Rodgers saying he feels vindicated about leaving Celtic before the end of last season.</p>
      <p>“However with the treble Treble still in the balance he left on sour terms for the majority of Celtic supporters.</p>

      <p>“On the bright side though Neil Lennon has us playing more entertaining football on the front foot and I firmly believe Rodgers would have failed miserably in qualifying from our Europa League section.”</p>
      <p><b>Gordon Ashley, Ayr,</b> isn’t convinced by the reported interest in Rangers midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glen-kamara">Glen Kamara</a> despite scouts watching the Finn in action against Porto last week.</p>
      <p>He said: “I see Rangers are putting Glen Kamara up as the latest fantasy Premier League target now that the planned £10m for Captain Kaos Tavernier has been exposed for the joke fairytale it was. Kamara is a non goalscoring bang average SPFL midfielder who was taken to school by Broony at Ibrox.”</p>
      <p>The poppy row refuses to go away and the Green Brigade were again in the line of fire for their conduct during Sunday’s win over Motherwell.</p>

      <p>Celtic fan <b>Steven Mackin</b> from Glasgow blasted: “I am a Celtic man and I’m very proud that my father and uncles were all in the forces.</p>
      <p>“It disgusts me that we have a section of our support who are dragging our club’s name through the gutter.</p>
      <p>“As for the banners they produce - do they not realise that if it wasn’t for the brave men that fell in the wars then they would not have the right to do that?”</p>
      <p><b>John Burke, Condorrat,</b> added: “There was a Celtic player named Willie Angus from Carluke who won the Victoria Cross for his bravery. He received 40 wounds in the Great War. Perhaps his story will shut up some of the people who were desecrating the memorial service.”</p>
      <p>But <b>Ian McCaulay, Glasgow,</b> said: “I disagree with the actions of the idiots who came in and booed and chanted - it was out of order. But I think the poppy should be kept out of football.</p>

      <p>“It has been hijacked by the Far Right in political terms and by certain football clubs.”</p>
      <p>Onto the management hunts at Hearts and Hibs and <b>Lewis Doyle, Limerick,</b> had a message for both Edinburgh clubs: “What a boost for Scottish football if all the names being suggested for both Hibs and Hearts are true.</p>
      <p>“It would suggest to me that the exploits of both Celtic and Rangers are not going unnoticed.</p>
      <p>“This must be great news for the punters too as they will see new types of football.</p>
      <p>“It will attract European footballers and bring much needed financial support for our game. I truly hope it comes to fruition as our game needs a boost.</p>

        <figcaption>(Image: Reuters)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“So I would appeal to both the Edinburgh clubs to think hard please and if your looking for an example look what an impact Celtic’s Henrik Larsson had attracting others to our game.</p>
      <p>“Scotland needs good football in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Lanarkshire. The people of Scotland are always happier when their passion for football is served up to them.”</p>
      <p>But <b>Jimmy Murray, Edinburgh,</b> isn’t convinced Celtic assistant John Kennedy is up to the Hibs job. He claimed: “John Kennedy won’t go to Hibs. He’s on a cushy number at Celtic. He didn't resign despite being part of the Delia shambles.</p>
      <p>“At least Collins and Delia put their hands up and walked. Not John. He went on to be Rodgers defence coach which saw Celtic’s worst ever performances for goals against in Europe.”</p>
      <p>Finally, Scotland might have a problem getting our best players to turn up for international duty but down south it seems England stars are fighting for the opportunity - all too literally if Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez’s spat is anything to go by.</p>
      <p><b>Peter Wedlock</b> emailed: “Raheem is a great player but it has got to his head. Why was he not booked on Sunday? One reason - he is an English player. But his manager left him out and does that not say enough?”</p>
