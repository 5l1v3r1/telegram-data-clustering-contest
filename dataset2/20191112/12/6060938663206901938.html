      <p>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will take a grid penalty at this weekend's Brazilian <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Formula-One">Formula One</a> Grand Prix after team boss <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mattia-Binotto">Mattia Binotto</a> said his car's power unit was damaged and needed replacing.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Monegasque is third in the championship, 14 points ahead of Red Bull's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Max-Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> with two races remaining.</p>
      <p>"Charles will get a new Power Unit (at Interlagos), as his was damaged on Saturday in Austin, which meant he had to use a previously used and less powerful version for the rest of the weekend," Binotto said in a race preview.</p>
      <p>"Fitting a new power unit means taking a grid penalty in Sao Paulo, but we should be back to our normal performance level and show some fighting spirit to finish the season on a high note."</p>
      <p>Mercedes have already won both championships for the sixth year in a row, with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lewis-Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> sealing his sixth drivers' title at the U.S. Grand Prix in Texas on Nov. 3.</p>
      <p>Leclerc finished fourth in Austin after the engine failure in qualifying, but still set the fastest lap, with team mate <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebastian-Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> retiring from the race with a broken rear right suspension.</p>
