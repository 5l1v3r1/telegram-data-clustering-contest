      <p>CALGARY -- Shares in Ensign Energy Services Inc. fell after it cut its dividend in half due to what it said was prevailing industry conditions as it reported a third-quarter loss of $37.8 million.</p>
      <p>The oilfield services company saw its shares fall 27 cents or about 10 per cent to $2.41 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange after falling as low as $2.29.</p>
      <p>The drop came after Ensign said it will pay a quarterly dividend of six cents per share, down from 12 cents, to allow it "pursue alternative uses of available cash."</p>
      <p>The company also ended its dividend reinvestment plan.</p>
      <p>The reduced payment to shareholders came as the company said its loss in its latest quarter amounted to 24 cents per share compared with a loss of $32.8 million or 21 cents per share in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Revenue in the quarter totalled $393.5 million, up from $288.7 million in the third quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>Ensign acquired an 89.3 per cent stake in Trinidad Drilling Ltd. in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the remaining stake in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
