      <h1>Marie Osmond 'chipped off a piece' of kneecap in scary Las Vegas concert spill</h1>

      <p>No injury will stop <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/marie-osmond-remarrying-first-husband-steve-craig">Marie Osmond</a> from performing.</p>
      <p>During a Las Vegas performance last week, Osmond took a tumble onstage and took to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6G8GNvY-Qk">The Talk</a>” to address the situation.</p>
      <p>In the interview, Osmond revealed that she “chipped off a piece” of her kneecap in the fall — but that is not deterring the “Read My Lips” singer from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/donny-and-marie-osmond-explain-why-they-are-ending-their-las-vegas-residency">finishing up her Las Vegas residency</a>.</p>

      <p>“This is the last week of shows at the Flamingo. And so for those of you that have bought tickets for that last week, I will be there,” Marie assured.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/donny-osmond-returns-to-dwts-says-hes-lasted-in-showbiz-for-55-years-by-constantly-reinventing-himself">Donny [Osmond]</a> was so sweet. He said, ‘Marie, I can handle the last week,’ and I said, ‘I think they want to see Donny and Marie,’ ” she continued.</p>
      <p>“But it’s underneath the kneecap, I chipped off a piece,” she said. “So I probably won’t be dancing a lot, but I will be [there] — I can sing!”</p>

      <p>This is not the first time Osmond has fallen while performing. In September, Osmond fell while performing and both of her knees were left black and blue.</p>
      <p>“I’m always okay, and you know, it’s just interesting that it would be so close together. I’ve never fallen before,” Marie said in reference to the September incident.</p>
      <p>“I think maybe the knee was a little bit not as strong. I probably should have been wearing my brace. But as I made that turn my boot stuck on the floor and then I wasn’t able to turn and I just went down.”</p>

      <p>In a separate appearance on <a href="https://youtu.be/9pLSB6UlRJM">“The Talk” from September</a>, Marie noted that “[Donny and I] have this bet between us, that if anybody ever falls or has an accident, you keep singing.”</p>
      <p>“If you don’t keep singing you have to pay the other person 500 bucks. The whole time I’m like, ‘save the microphone, save the microphone! Not the knees.’”</p>
