      <p>Harry captioned the post: "Look who I was working with today. This woman knows how to COMMAND a scene.</p>
      <p>"Ritchiescott #reunion #EastEnders #dodgybird."</p>
      <p>Fans rushed to comment on the reunion.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Ritchie Scott loving it."</p>
      <p>A second commented: "Aww, who doesn't love a reunion?"</p>
      <p>A third said: "Looking good Harry."</p>
      <p>Sian has played solicitor Ritchie on and off since 2005, representing Albert Square residents in multiple different cases.</p>

      <p>Ritchie has represented the Mitchell family on more than one occasion.</p>
      <p>In 2012 she helped Phil Mitchell's cousin Billy when he was arrested for the murder of Heather Trott.</p>

      <p>Eventually Ben, who was played by Joshua Pascoe at the time, confessed to Heather's murder but refused to let Ritchie represent him.</p>
      <p>In 2015 Ben, then played by Harry, was arrested for the murder of Lucy Beale.</p>

      <p>Harry left EastEnders in 2018 after Ben left for a new life in France.</p>
      <p>Ben returned earlier this year played by Max.</p>
      <p>Since the character's comeback, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/eastenders-viewers-ecstatic-as-ritchie-scott-returned-last-night/">Ritchie has made an appearance changing Phil's Will</a>.</p>
      <p>Phil made the decision to remove Ben from his will and put Arches' mechanic Keanu in it instead.</p>
