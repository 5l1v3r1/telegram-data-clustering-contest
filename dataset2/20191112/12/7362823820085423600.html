      <h1>New York Jets' Sam Darnold has playoffs on his mind</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:00:19+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p>In the words of former NFL head coach Jim Mora … playoffs?</p>
      <p>That’s what most of the NFL world is saying after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/sam-darnold">Sam Darnold</a> expressed his confidence following the team’s win over the lowly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> on Sunday.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Darnold, who helped the Jets with 230 passing yards, a passing touchdown and a rushing touchdown on Sunday, appeared to be overly confident with the team’s playoff chances.</p>
      <p>“We need every win from now on because we've still got a chance. I mean, if we get on a roll here and we win out, we've got a chance at the playoffs,” Darnold said, according to The (<a href="https://twitter.com/andy_vasquez/status/1193653933648027648">Bergen County) Record</a>. “Guys in this locker room know this. They know that, and we're really excited to continue to get back to work. That's what it's about.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>With the win, New York is now 2-7 on the season. If they win out, they would be 9-7 and have a legitimate shot at making the playoffs given how open the AFC wild card picture looks. The team is just three games out of a potential second wild card spot.</p>
      <p>Making a run may not be as farfetched.</p>
      <p>New York plays the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cincinnati-bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> in their next four games. The toughest opponent remaining on their schedule is the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>, who they play on Dec. 12. The Jets also don’t have any games left against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a>.</p>
      <p>The Jets made the playoffs with an 8-8 record in 1991 and with a 9-7 record in 2009.</p>

      <p>However, the odds are certainly stacked against them.</p>
