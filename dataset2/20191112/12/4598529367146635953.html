      <p>After speaking with a judge Monday afternoon, lawyers for acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney backed off their attempt to join a lawsuit filed by former deputy NSA Charles Kupperman.</p>
      <p>According to a transcript of the conversation obtained by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/11/bolton-deputy-mulvaney-impeachment-lawsuit-069309?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f0fa-dd93-ad7f-f8ffe0400000&amp;nlid=630318">Politico</a>, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon said that he was disinclined to allow the motion for Mulvaney to intervene in the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Mulvaney’s lawyers will reportedly file a lawsuit of their own to determine if he has to comply with the House subpoena to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>The acting chief of staff’s move to join the lawsuit last week <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bolton-mulvaney-lawsuit-impeachment-ukraine">shocked and dismayed</a> Kupperman’s, and by extension, former NSA John Bolton’s, allies not least because Mulvaney has been increasingly implicated as a central player in the Ukraine pressure campaign by witnesses in the inquiry.</p>
