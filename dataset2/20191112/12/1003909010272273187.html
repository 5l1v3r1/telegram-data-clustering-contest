      <h1>Opinion: The algorithm is the source of social media evil</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:00:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Recently, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, declared that Twitter will soon end political and issue advertising on their platform. @Jack pointed out the evils of social media advertising and how they “present entirely new challenges to civic discourse.” He is right about the symptoms, but not the disease or the cure. Now pundits are calling for Facebook and other social media platforms to follow Twitter.</p>
      <p>@Jack’s analysis of the evils of algorithm-driven advertising are completely correct, but his solution is wrong. The problem isn’t advertising, it’s the algorithm. The solution isn’t to get rid of political advertising but instead to not allow the algorithm to distort political discussion. If the algorithm weren’t controlling who does and does not see an ad, our society would be much better off.</p>
      <p>In the days before social media, advertisements were “broadcast” to people. All the people. You produced an ad and sent it out into the world for almost everyone to see. The people who agreed with you, those who knew nothing about the topic, and those who strongly disagreed all saw the ad. If you lied, you could be sure of knowing that your opponents would find out and call you out on it. If your arguments were debatable, you could expect them to be debated.  </p>
      <p>Today, social media allows you to target your ads exclusively to people who agree with you. That’s not good. If that were the whole problem, it would be a huge issue, but what happens is even worse. If you advertise on Facebook or Twitter the advertising software — the algorithm — specifically shows your ad to those it predicts will like the ad and doesn’t show it to those who won’t be interested. It especially doesn’t show your ad to people who will disagree with it. This polarizes our society.</p>
      <p>If you think people are becoming less tolerant in their views, you’re right. The information platforms we use result in people being less exposed to other viewpoints than at any time in the last 200 years. Social media tools that make sure people only see what they like, damage the ability of society to show empathy and develop understanding. It diminishes tolerance and promotes extremism. The algorithm becomes a source of evil. </p>
      <p>It also becomes a tool for manipulation. If you understand what the algorithm is trying to do, you can game the system by exploiting its design. </p>
      <p>There is a story, likely apocryphal, circulating among political strategists that Donald Trump’s surprising 2016 wins in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin were because his campaign figured out how to game Facebook. Trump’s team realized that there were big differences between Hillary Clinton’s advertising messages to Democrats in poor areas versus rich areas. Trump-supporting PACs are rumoured to have taken Clinton ads aimed at affluent white Democrats and rerun those ads at urban black Democrats and vice versa. This exposure of the two wings of the Democrat campaign to the targeted messages aimed at the other wing had the effect of suppressing enthusiasm and turnout in both groups. I don’t know if the story is true, but the logic works.</p>
      <p>The solution to stopping the caustic effects of targeted social media advertising isn’t to ban advertising, but to ban algorithm-driven targeting. Return to “broadcasting” ads.  Ads that are seen by a broad cross-section of voters will inevitably be fairer, more civil and more conducive to a moderate society.</p>
      <p>Twitter and Facebook shouldn’t ban political or issue advertising. They should limit targeting only to geography. Let the information flow to all the voters in a region and let the marketplace of ideas and the debate between conflicting points of view be played out in an open and pluralistic society. Ending the algorithm-driven intellectual ghettoization of our political culture is something to be desired.</p>
      <p>A world where you get to see a broad variety of persuasive political messages will lead to a society that is fairer, and more mature.</p>
