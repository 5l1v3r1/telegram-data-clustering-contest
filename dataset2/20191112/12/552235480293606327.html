      <h1>Violent teen who brandished knife and attacked kids with dog lead in court again</h1>
      <h2>Kieron Roberts has admitted breaching his court order.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:32:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/airdrie-and-coatbridge-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A violent teen has breached a court order given for a spree of attacks in Airdrie.</p>
      <p>Kieron Roberts, 18, went on the rampage in August 2017 when he was only 15-years-old.</p>
      <p>At Gartlea Park, he struck a 13-year-old with a dog lead and punched another youngster on the head repeatedly.</p>
      <p>A week later he placed another pair of teenagers in a state of fear and alarm with his threatening behaviour and shockingly then brandished a knife at a 12-year-old girl on Strain Crescent in Gartlea.</p>
      <p>Glasgow resident Roberts could now be tagged for the breach after a restriction of liberty assessment was called for.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Petra Collins said: “This was imposed by Sheriff Shankland so I’ll defer for her to deal with it on November 29.”</p>
