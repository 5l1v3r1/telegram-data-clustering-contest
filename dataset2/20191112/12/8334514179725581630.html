      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will not force hard coal power plants to close over the next seven years, a draft law expected to be approved by the cabinet next week showed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A previous blueprint seen by Reuters stipulated that utilities would be forced to deactivate hard coal power plants by 2026 if not enough closures happen voluntarily.</p>
      <p>The government plans to use a mixture of subsidies and tenders to encourage operators to close coal plants beginning next year.</p>
      <p>The draft law could make the process more expensive if it requires the government to spend more on such incentives.</p>
      <p>It calls for incentives to fall each year, a strategy designed to entice operators to close down coal plants early.</p>
      <p>It is part of German plans to phase out coal by 2038 and will be put to a vote in the Bundestag lower house should the cabinet approve it next Monday.</p>
      <p>It envisages that by 2022 an estimated 12 hard coal plants would be shut down, leaving about 30 feeding some 15 gigawatts (GW) into the grid.</p>
      <p>Germany has more than 40 plants running either fully or partially on hard coal, according to the Federal Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>The decision against forced closures looks set to allow utility Uniper (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/UN01.DE">UN01.DE</a>) to start commercial operations at its 1.5 billion euro Datteln 4 coal-fired power plant.</p>
      <p>It had originally been recommended that the 1.1 gigawatt plant, which would add 100 million euros to Uniper’s operating profit per year, never enter service.</p>
      <p>Sascha Bibert, Uniper’s finance chief, declined to comment on the draft law, saying he would wait for the official version.</p>
      <p>The government has estimated the cost of shutting down hard coal plants at less than 1 billion euros.</p>
      <p>Last month, measures it approved to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions were criticised by activists and industry groups as too weak to achieve Germany’s goal of becoming emissions-neutral by 2050.</p>
      <p>The government also wants to reach a deal with utilities on a timetable to shut down brown coal plants and agree a framework for compensation.</p>
      <p>Starting in 2020, the government each year will decide how many gigawatts of brown coal-produced energy should be removed from the grid and ask utilities to submit compensation estimates.</p>
      <p>The cost of shutting brown coal plants is estimated at more than 2 billion euros.</p>
