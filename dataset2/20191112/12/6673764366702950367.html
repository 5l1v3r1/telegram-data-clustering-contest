      <p><b>HONG KONG – </b>World No. 1 Kento Momota unexpectedly withdrew from the Hong Kong Open on Tuesday without playing a match, leaving Indian challenger Kidambi Srikanth to advance to the second round.</p>
      <p>The shock departure comes only a few days after the 24-year-old beat Taiwan’s world No. 2 Chou Tien-chen to claim his 10th title of the year at the Fuzhou China Open, seemingly on an unstoppable path to 2020 Olympic glory.</p>
      <p>Momota and Srikanth — who have played each other 15 times, with the current world No. 1 winning 12 matches — were set to clash on Wednesday, but there was no indication why he had withdrawn from his first match.</p>
      <p>Srikanth will now face either compatriot Sourabh Verma or Frenchman Brice Leverdez to reach the quarterfinal.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been on mixed form after crashing out of the Denmark Open in October.</p>
      <p>Momota, with over 300 wins under his belt, saw his career descend into controversy in 2016 when he was suspended for more than a year for visiting an illegal casino and was denied a spot at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
      <p>The star, who was the world’s second-ranked player at the time, has since worked his way back to the top and his win in China had raised his Olympic hopes a year ahead of the Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>This year alone he claimed Japan’s first All England men’s series title in March, retaining the Japan Open — which also doubled as a test event for the 2020 Olympics — before triumphing at the Victor China Open, the Korea Open and the Denmark Open.</p>
