      <h1>Kento Momota in shock withdrawal from Hong Kong Open</h1>

      <p>HONG KONG: World number one <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kento-Momota">Kento Momota</a> unexpectedly withdrew from badminton's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> on Tuesday -- without playing a match -- leaving Indian challenger <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kidambi-Srikanth">Kidambi Srikanth</a> to advance to the second round.</p>
      <p>The shock departure comes only a few days after the 24-year-old beat Taiwan's world number two <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chou-Tien-chen">Chou Tien-chen</a> to claim his 10th title of the year at the Fuzhou China Open, seemingly on an unstoppable path to 2020 Olympic glory.</p>
      <p>Momota and Srikanth -- who have played each other 15 times, with the Japanese player winning 12 games -- were set to clash on Wednesday, but there was no indication why he had withdrawn from his first match.</p>
      <p>Srikanth will now face either compatriot Sourabh Verma or Frenchman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brice-Leverdez">Brice Leverdez</a> to reach the quarterfinal.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has been on mixed form after crashing out of the Denmark Open in October.</p>
      <p>Momota, with over 300 wins under his belt, saw his career descend into controversy in 2016 when he was suspended for more than a year for visiting an illegal casino and was denied a spot at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
      <p>The star, who was world number two at the time, has since worked his way back to the top and his win in China had raised his Olympic hopes a year ahead of the Tokyo Games.</p>
      <p>This year alone he claimed Japan's first All England men's series title in March, retaining the Japan open -- which also doubled up as a test event for the 2020 Olympics -- before triumphing at Victor China Open, the Korea Open, and the Denmark Open.</p>
