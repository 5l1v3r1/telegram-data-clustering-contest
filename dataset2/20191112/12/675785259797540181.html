      <p>A schoolgirl has been rushed to hospital after her mother saw scraps of papers emerging from her eye.</p>
      <p>The seven-year-old girl, known as Duoduo, said she was stopped by three boys in her class and forced putting tiny pieces of paper into her eyes on September 28.</p>
      <p>Mum Ms Li claimed Duoduo complained of blurred vision and rushed her to a hospital in Henan, central China, for treatment.</p>
      <p>Specialists who treated Duoduo said they have never seen a case like it, reported Henan Television's City Channel.</p>
      <p>Video shows the doctor using cotton swabs to pluck a small piece of paper out from Duoduo's eyes as a nurse holds onto her.</p>

      <p>The doctor said he has retrieved dozens of them over a month's visit, however, it's not sure if all of the pieces were gone.</p>
      <p>Ms Li said: "They [The boys] opened her eyes wide...crumpled a few scraps at a time and squeezed them in.</p>
      <p>"The yellow and white paper scraps are from the exercise books."</p>
