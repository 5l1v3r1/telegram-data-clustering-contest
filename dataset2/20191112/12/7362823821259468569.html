      <p>Speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation" Sunday, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/swalwell-says-evidence-in-impeachment-depositions-amount-to-extortion-scheme-by-trump-admin">Rep. Eric Swalwell</a>, D-Calif., said that the evidence he has seen from the depositions given in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">House impeachment inquiry</a> into President Trump amounts to an “extortion scheme” by the White House.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, MSNBC's weekend host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-no-talent-msnbc-joy-reid">Joy Reid</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-joy-reid-thanksgiving-food-holiday-trump">told her viewers</a> on "AM Joy" not to "worry about trying to explain the cast of characters... or the very overused term, 'quid pro quo.'"</p>

      <p>"Most people can’t say it, spell it or understand it," Reid <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/mark-finkelstein/2019/11/09/joy-reid-ill-explain-impeachment-simply-so-even-trump">continued</a>. "What we’re actually talking about here is not a pithy Latin phrase. It’s something a lot simpler: bribery and extortion."</p>

      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox &amp; Friends"</a> with host Brian Kilmeade, the Fox News contributor explained that they were misattributing extortion.</p>
      <p>"Every time I think we've gotten to the bottom depths of nonsense in this, Brian, from a legal perspective, they sink even lower," he said.</p>

      <p>McCarthy explained that extortion is a "domestic criminal law concept" that has "no application to foreign relations."</p>
      <p>"Right now we are trying to extort the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran">Iranians</a>. We're trying to squeeze them with the president's maximum pressure policy to establish better terms. And, we're looking today at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel">Israel</a> for exactly why it's so important to do that," he told Kilmeade.</p>
      <p>"And, everybody in the country with a brain hopes the president succeeds here."</p>

      <p>"And, if it's extortion, most people would say that's better than war," he added.</p>
      <p>"The fact of the matter is, extortion is a domestic criminal law concept where everybody is involved with under the same rule of law...under the same legal authorities," McCarthy said.</p>

      <p>"In foreign relations, what countries do to each other is basically say, 'what do I have to do for you or to get you to act in a way that is consistent with what our interests are?'" he concluded.</p>
