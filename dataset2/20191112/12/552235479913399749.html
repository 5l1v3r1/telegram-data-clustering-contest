      <h1>Airdrie benefits cheat in court again after admitting breach of payback order</h1>
      <h2>Wendy Morrissey will be back to face sentencing in January once reports have been gathered.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:24:52+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/airdrie-and-coatbridge-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A benefits cheat has admitted breaking the community payback order she was handed down for illegally obtaining nearly £10,000.</p>
      <p>Dalwhinnie Place resident Wendy Morrissey, 43, failed to declare to authorities that the landlord of her home was in fact the father of her children.</p>
      <p>As a result, she got her hands on £8500 to which she wasn’t entitled.</p>
      <p>Morrissey was spared a custodial sentence last September, but will now return to court in January to face punishment after admitting ignoring the alternative.</p>
      <p>A criminal justice social work report is necessary but wasn’t prepared on time after social work correspondence was sent to the wrong address.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Petra Collins said: “This is Sheriff Shankland’s case so I’ll defer it for reports again since the wrong address was in the system.</p>
      <p>”You’ll come back here on January 3.”</p>
