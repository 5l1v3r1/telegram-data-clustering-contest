      <h1>Yet another delay in case of ex-Bryanston High sports coach accused of sexually assaulting pupils</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:52:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>There are more delays in the case of a former Bryanston High School sports coach accused of sexually assaulting pupils.</p>
      <p>The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) is yet to decide on a review filed by the former coach, who cannot be named because he has not yet pleaded to sex crime charges. </p>
      <p>The case has been postponed over five times since first appearing in court.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old appeared briefly in the Alexandra Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The State said it was yet to receive a decision from the NDPP. </p>
      <p>Dressed in beige chino pants with a navy bomber jacket, the former coach sat in the gallery next to his partner, before making his way to the dock as proceedings started shortly after 09:00.</p>

      <p>The man was arrested in January after a 17-year-old pupil at the school and her mother opened a case against him.</p>
      <p>He was then dismissed on March 1 after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of sexual harassment and financial mismanagement. </p>
      <p>His lawyers had written to the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to ask for a review of the decision to prosecute him.</p>
      <p>However, when the DPP refused the review representations, it was then taken to the NDPP, who is yet to give a directive, the court heard. </p>
      <p>It is understood that at least three other female pupils from the school also came forward with allegations after the initial claim emerged, News24 earlier reported.</p>
      <p>The alleged incidents of sexual assault are believed to have taken place during netball matches and on school outings between 2017 and 2018. </p>
      <p>The matter was postponed to February 4, 2020, for a decision from the NDPP. The former coach's bail has been extended.</p>
