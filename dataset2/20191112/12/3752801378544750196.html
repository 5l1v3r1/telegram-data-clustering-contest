      <p>A man stabbed three performers during a live show in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi </a><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Arabia</a>’s capital, state television reported on Monday, adding that the victims were in stable condition.</p>
      <p>In scenes that were unimaginable just two years ago, Saudi Arabia has staged glitzy performances by a host of international artists, from South Korean boy band BTS to pop icon Janet Jackson and rapper 50 Cent.</p>
      <p>But Saudi officials warn that introducing such reforms in a society steeped in conservatism is fraught with risk.</p>
      <p>While they are wildly popular among Saudi Arabia's majority young population, the reforms could anger arch-conservatives, including hardline clerics and the religious police whose powers have been clipped in recent years.</p>
      <p>"Liberals and conservatives in the kingdom are on a collision course and that probably worries Saudi leaders the most," Quentin de Pimodan, a Saudi expert at the Greece-based Research Institute for European and American Studies, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"After this attack we can expect a sharper crackdown on those opposed to Saudi's entertainment push." </p>

      <p>The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis.</p>
      <p>SPA said the victims, two men and a woman, sustained "superficial wounds" and were stabilised after receiving medical care.</p>
      <p>The General Entertainment Authority has said it plans to pump $64bn into the sector in the coming decade.</p>
