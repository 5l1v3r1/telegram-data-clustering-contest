      <p>INDORE: Skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> had his first experience of negotiating a pink ball as Indian cricketers took turns to get used to the new colour during the net session ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh, starting Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Indian team did not train under the lights and the throwdowns with the SG pink ball was part of the traditional red-ball practice session.</p>
      <p>Usually, three adjacent nets are placed -- for pacers, spinner and throwdowns -- for Indian team's practice. However, on team's request, the throwdown-net was created on the other side of the ground on separate practice turfs with a black sight-screen.</p>
      <p>It was skipper Kohli, who first faced the pink ball.</p>
      <p>With throwdown specialists Raghavendra and Sri Lankan Nuwan Senaviratne hurling the pink stuff at express pace, the skipper looked comfortable. He looked more intent on playing defensive shots.</p>
      <p>Once Kohli was done and went into the main nets, the other top-order batsmen including <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cheteshwar-Pujara">Cheteshwar Pujara</a> mixed and matched, facing red and pink ball simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Young reserve opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shubman-Gill">Shubman Gill</a> seemed to have taken a hit when one of the deliveries bounced extra but it was not serious.</p>
      <p>The Indian team will get only two full training days ahead of their first Day/Night Test at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>, starting November 22.</p>
      <p>Aware that not much time is in hand, the BCCI had arranged a couple of pink ball sessions under lights for the Test specialists like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mayank-Agarwal">Mayank Agarwal</a>, Pujara, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammed Shami</a> at the NCA under <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ramachandra-Guha">Rahul Dravid</a>'s guidance.</p>
