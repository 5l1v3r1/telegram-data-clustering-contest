      <h1>Tennessee Titans' Taylor Lewan acknowledges mistakes: 'My penalties are f-----g awful'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans</a> offensive lineman Taylor Lewan decided to beat himself up Sunday over his own mistakes on the field.</p>
      <p>Lewan told reporters Sunday after the team’s huge victory over the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> that his own mistakes were hurting the team and ripped himself for causing so many penalties.</p>

      <p>“First of all, before we even start this whole thing, my penalties are f-----g awful. I am 100 percent at issue with that,” Lewan said, according to <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nfl/titans/2019/11/12/titans-taylor-lewan-penalties-mike-vrabel-nfl-week-11/2568604001/">The Tennessean</a>. “It is not intentional. I do not mean to do it. My intentions are good. I am just trying to finish, and it is killing the team. I know that. You guys know that. No one needs to call me out because I’ve got a voice. I am completely screwing the team with the amount of penalties I have had, what, these last six games.”</p>
      <p>Lewan is not wrong when it comes to his own penalties. After being suspended for the first four games of the season, the offensive tackle has racked up a team-high nine penalties. He has the third-highest penalties committed this season. Laremy Tunsil of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a> and David Bakhhtiari of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</a> are tied for first.</p>

      <p>No one on the Titans has been penalized more than six times this season.</p>
      <p>In Sunday’s 35-32 victory, Lewan received penalties for unnecessary roughness and holding on back-to-back plays in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>“It’s crazy. It’s horrible,” he said. “I cannot get penalties. I am sorry; there is no need to ask me about it because I know I am an absolute liability when it comes to penalties.”</p>
