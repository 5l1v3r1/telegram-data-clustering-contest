      <p>With Golden Arrows set to host Mamelodi Sundowns again in a cup match, following the KwaZulu-Natal team’s 3-2 win in the Absa Premiership this past weekend, coach Steve Komphela is hoping for a double over his counterpart Pitso Mosimane and his team. </p>
      <p>Abafana Bes’thende will host the Brazilians in their Telkom Knockout semi-final match at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on November 23. </p>

      <p>Komphela has spoken about how they beat Downs, as well as the team’s impressive performances of late.    </p>
      <p>“This match was played after four difficult matches where we played Polokwane City, SuperSport United all twice in a row in Telkom Cup and ABSA Premier League. We’ll be playing Mamelodi Sundowns twice as well. The approach to the match was similar where we defended very well and was courageous enough to impose our offensive play. We had a fairly balanced first half where both teams had to deal with rainy weather conditions. The opponent had an advantage of playing with the rain and wind and we were against. The opponent broke wide from their left and a soft cross was made and we conceded a very soft goal. The score was 0-1 and the first half came to an end. We had a good first half except the mistake that led to the goal,” said Komphela as quoted on Arrows’ official website. </p>

      <p>“We started the second half with the wind and the rain. We then opted to press the opponent high up. We dominated the second half. Had a great team performance and scored three goals in the process. The equalizer came in the 60th minute when Phiri took a shot and the goalkeeper fluffed the shot due to wet weather and lack of grip from gloves. Ten minutes later we made it 2-1 when Lunga played a diagonal ball and Mutizwa finished the chance, far post. In the 80th minute we made it 3-1 after a great short interplay leading to the opponent box where Parusnath was fouled inside the box. Mutizwa stepped up and hit the third one to make it 3:1. All looked well and the match was nearing its end, the opponent scored their second from bad defending and lapse in concentration. The score was 3- and the match ended with tension and excitement. We (are) meeting the same opponent again in our next match on the 23/11/2019 in the Telkom Cup,” the coach added.  </p>
