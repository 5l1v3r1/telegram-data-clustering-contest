      <p>The annual celebration has been given extra significance this year with the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor.</p>
      <p>It is one of the biggest birthday celebrations in the world: millions of Sikhs will today mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of their religion.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The annual celebration has been given extra significance this year with the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, a secure, visa-free passage between India and Pakistan that gives Indian Sikhs access to the place where the guru breathed his last in 1539, now one of the religion's holiest sites.</p>
      <h3>What is Sikhism?</h3>
      <p>Sikhism is a monotheistic religion born in the 15th-century in Punjab — meaning the land of five rivers, a region spanning parts of what is now India and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Five and a half centuries later, Sikhs number up to 30 million worldwide, with a rich diaspora in places such as Canada, the US and Europe — although the vast majority remain in India.</p>

      <p>Once rulers of the Punjab, they were considered a 'martial race' by the British colonisers.</p>
      <p>Men, in particular, are instantly recognisable by their colourful turbans, used to cover their hair, which they must leave uncut.</p>
      <p>That is one of the five articles of their faith they must carry all the time, known as the Five Ks: the Kesh (uncut hair), Kara (a steel bracelet), Kanga (a wooden comb), Kaccha (cotton underwear), and Kirpan (a curved dagger).</p>

      <p>Sikhs worship God, known to them as Waheguru, or "wonderful teacher", inside gurdwaras, or "doorways to God".</p>
      <p>The word "Sikh" means the "seeker", or the "learner".</p>
      <p>Male Sikhs bear the name "Singh", which means lion; while women go by "Kaur", or princess.</p>
      <h3>Who was Guru Nanak?</h3>

      <p>Guru Nanak was born in 1469 to a Hindu family at Nankana Sahib, a city about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Lahore.</p>
      <p>Some legends say there were signs of divinity around him from the start, such as the time a cobra was found rearing over his head — not to attack him, but to shade him from the sun as he napped.</p>
      <p>As he grew older the Guru began travelling, preaching a faith based on equality and one God.</p>
      <p>He died in 1539 in Kartarpur, where his remains are buried.</p>

      <p>Nine gurus followed Guru Nanak and there is no living human successor, but the Guru Granth Sahib — the Sikh holy book — is considered the 11th and eternal.</p>
      <h3>What happens on his birthday?</h3>
      <p>Sikhs around the world, but especially on the subcontinent, will come together to sing, pray, eat and hold sprawling processions to different gurdwaras.</p>

      <p>In Pakistan, thousands of Sikhs are expected to mark the occasion at Nankana Sahib and Kartarpur.</p>
      <h3>Why is this year special?</h3>
      <p>Apart from it being the 550th anniversary, this year also saw the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor — a secure land link allowing Indian Sikhs to visit the gurdwara in the Pakistani town where the Guru died.</p>
