      <h1>Nipsey Hussle Artist Killa Twan Threatens Wack 100 &amp; Blueface</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:53:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles, CA – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51315/title.b-g-knocc-out-says-eric-holder-was-on-nipsey-hussles-label-when-he-allegedly-snitched">Killa Twan</a> is apparently still bothered by Wack 100’s<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53246/title.wack-100-excuses-nipsey-hussles-murder-you-supposed-to-handle-your-business"> inflammatory comments</a> about the late Nipsey Hussle. Shortly after the longtime music manager appeared to justify Eric Holder’s actions — not once but twice — Twan has issued an ominous warning via Twitter.</p>
      <p>“On NicKersons I’ll fuck over @bluefacebleedem in a head up squabble,” he wrote. “LiL nigga betta wach his muhhfuckin mouf…him &amp; wack!!”</p>

      <p>In a leaked audio clip that started making the rounds last month, Wack said Holder, Nip’s alleged killer, had no choice but handle his business.</p>
      <p>A couple of days later, <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53344/title.wack-100-apologizes-for-inflammatory-nipsey-hussle-comments-you-guys-win">he apologized</a> at the suggestion of Nip’s former manager Eugene “Big U” Henley but then <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53393/title.wack-100-reinforces-controversial-nipsey-hussle-comments-calls-the-posthumous-love-fake">doubled down</a> on his commentary during an interview with the <i>No Jumper</i> podcast.</p>
      <p>“In this situation, you have a rapper and you have a dude who is a straight, authentic gang member,” he said. “His whole life are these blocks. In the culture of gangbanging, when you call a muthafucka a bitch, a snitch, a rapist, a pedophile — when you call somebody these things in this jungle, it’s no different than you being a football player and going on the field without your helmet on. You’re going to get hit.”</p>

      <p>Nip, of course, was <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50867/title.nipsey-hussle-reportedly-pronounced-dead-at-33">shot and killed</a> on March 31 after he allegedly called Holder a “snitch.”</p>
      <p>Twan is signed to Nipsey’s All Money In imprint, so it makes sense he has Nip’s back in both life and death.</p>
