      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chaim-gartenberg" target="_blank">Chaim Gartenberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN">Disney+</a> is here, and the first episode of Lucasfilm’s highly anticipated live-action series, <i>The Mandalorian</i>, is live. Once you’ve finished devouring <i>The Mandalorian</i>’s pilot, you might be wondering when the next episode will arrive, and at what time. That goes for <i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, </i>too. The answer is midnight every Friday from here on out.</p>
      <aside>Streaming starts at 12:00am ET</aside>
      <p>Disney says they’ll be added to Disney+ on a weekly basis, starting on Friday, November 15th. Those new episodes will also be added at 12:00am ET, so you might have to put in some late nights if you want to watch <i>The Mandalorian</i> immediately<i>. </i>Or you can just watch the new episodes over the weekend, which is probably Disney’s actual logic here.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will cost $6.99 per month to subscribe, or $69.99 per year. There’s also a seven-day free trial, for those who want to give the service a shot before they commit to paying. Disney will also have a $12.99-a-month bundle that includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20830219/disney-plus-hands-on-first-look-demo-design-d23-wars-pixar-marvel">Disney+</a>, <a href="https://go.web.plus.espn.com/L3ONY">ESPN+</a>, and ad-supported <a href="https://fave.co/2ztoLN9">Hulu</a>.
