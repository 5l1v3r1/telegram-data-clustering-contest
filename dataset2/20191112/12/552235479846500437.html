      <p>More than £88,000 of former council tenant arrears has been written off.</p>
      <p>The local authority can write off rent debts if councillors deem them to be irrecoverable.</p>
      <p>Last week at a housing committee meeting, councillors agreed to write off former tenant arrears accounts totaling £88,050.10.</p>
      <p>The arrears date back to 2014, according to a report which went before members.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It read: “The council has to consider writing-off arrears of rent which it has not been possible to collect or which it considers will not be recoverable.</p>
      <p>“It should be noted that, although these cases are written-off, a record of the arrears is maintained and there is nothing to prevent later pursuit of the debt if new information becomes available in the future, with the exception of prescribed debts.”</p>
      <p>When a tenancy ends and there are current tenant arrears of rent outstanding from the current and previous years, a former tenant rent account is created.</p>
