      <p>Death metal got its due on <i>Jeopardy!</i> in the show’s <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/tag/jeopardy/">latest music clue</a>.

      <p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, here’s <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=6464">another</a> music-related clue from last night’s show.
