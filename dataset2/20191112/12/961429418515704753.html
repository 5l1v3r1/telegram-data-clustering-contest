        <b>The NHS pensions crisis has almost “washed away” the benefit from the government expanding medical trainee numbers and opening new medical schools, one of the UK’s top doctors has warned. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Royal College of Physicians president Andrew Goddard also told <i>HSJ </i>planned<i> </i>operations and tests like endoscopies were at most risk of being cancelled because of the problem over winter, stating: “We are only just keeping on top of cancer targets by putting on lists at the weekend.”</p>
      <p>And – as local NHS leaders are encouraged to deploy more workarounds to the problem – he said “the problem lies with the Treasury” and “the best solution is to scrap the [pensions tax] taper”.</p>
      <p>Through this year, shortages of medical consultants have worsened at many trusts as they have been with increased taxes on their pensions – often including very large unexpected tax bills – which has led to many turning down additional shifts or leaving the NHS altogether.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>HSJ, </i>Dr Goddard said of the impact: “It is almost at the point whereby the expansion of medical school numbers has been washed away.” He described this as a “great shame”.</p>
      <p>Last year <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/government-reveals-new-medical-schools/7021972.article">the government made a major announcement</a> of the creation of 1,500 additional medical school places, and the opening of five new medical schools.</p>
      <p>Dr Goddard’s comment indicates that the benefit of those new trainees, when they join the workforce in future years, could be offset by the medical capacity currently being lost to the NHS due to the pensions problem.</p>
      <p>The RCP is also calling for expansion in places by a further 6,000 in coming years. Dr Goddard told <i>HSJ </i>he anticipated further growth being announced in the NHS People Plan, which is being developed by NHS England and Improvement and due to be published in coming months. He said of the likely scale of expansion: “If you could improve retention you could get away with an additional 3,000 [places] at this stage.”</p>
      <h3><anchor name="Pressure_on_electives"/>Pressure on electives</h3>
      <p>Dr Goddard described the pensions situation as “a disaster waiting to happen” and said he had heard of RCP members who had to remortgage their homes because of high tax bills.</p>
      <p>“There may be an impact [on acute services] but it will be greater on elective waiting lists,” Dr Goddard said, giving endoscopy as an example of a service that would be particularly affected. “We are only just keeping on top of cancer targets [at the moment] by putting on lists at the weekend.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/finance-and-efficiency/exclusive-trusts-told-to-take-extraordinary-action-to-tackle-pensions-crisis-ahead-of-winter/7026327.article">Last week <i>HSJ</i> revealed</a> NHSE/I emergency care director Dame Pauline Phillip had written to trust leaders, instructing them to offer consultants extra payments to do additional shifts which many are declining because of the pension-related tax bills. And NHS Employers has outlined “flexibilities” trusts could offer to staff to try to work around the problem. This follows the government consulting on solutions which fall short of scrapping the tax taper rule which is seen as the source of the problem.</p>
      <p>Dr Goddard told <i>HSJ </i>that trust chief executives were doing “all in their power” and “most trusts were giving people options”.</p>
      <p>“This is one of the biggest problems they are facing and it is out of their hands,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The problem lies with the Treasury and it needs to do something about it,” Dr Goddard said. “The best solution is to scrap the taper, I can’t see any other simple thing to resolve this. Every month that goes by we are haemorrhaging doctors.”</p>
      <h3><anchor name="Generalism_the_right_model"/>Generalism the right model</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, speaking about the focus in the NHS long-term plan on expanding medical generalism – something the RCP has supported – Dr Goddard said it was the “the right model” but warned of “confusion between generalism and the [hospital] front door”, risking prioritising the latter rather than giving more generalist training to specialists.</p>
      <p>He also said more needed to be done to improve medical training as a preparation for work, and added: “There is a huge tension between service and training and medical trainees feel they are being used to provide services.”</p>
