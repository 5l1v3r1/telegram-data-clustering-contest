      <h1>BBC presenter Craig Mitch forced to apologise after calling Liverpool 'a s***hole'</h1>
      <h2>The Match of the Day X host made the comments five years ago, including claiming Liverpool was a place where "people still haven't got jobs"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:38:16+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/match-of-the-day">Match of the Day</a> X presenter Craig Mitch has made a public apology after footage emerged of him calling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> a 's***hole'.</p>
      <p>In a clip from the YouTube show Filthy Fellas that was produced five years ago, the broadcaster can be seen making derogatory marks about the city and the people who live there.</p>
      <p>The BBC presenter is seen saying: "I went to Liverpool and it's still a s***hole.</p>
      <p>"I went there, people still haven't got jobs.</p>
      <p>"Things haven't changed. They (Liverpool FC) couldn't get the job done against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> . Why? Because they don't know what a job is."</p>

      <p>Later, a second video also surfaced in which again made derogatory marks about the city when discussing Steven Gerrard's move from the Reds to LA Galaxy.</p>
      <p>"He's going to a developed area. That's all it is," says the presenter.</p>
      <p>"He's leaving a deprived area and going to a very developed area where there's sun and low crime rates."</p>

      <p>The comments incensed Liverpool fans on social media, with many calling on his employers, including the BBC and talkSPORT, to take action against Mitch.</p>
      <p>That also prompted an apology from the broadcaster, who posted a message on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account addressing the controversy.</p>
      <p>"There is a video of me making insensitive jokes about Liverpool from 5 years ago on twitter.</p>
      <p>"This was clipped from an old episode of a YouTube show. I apologise for the offence these comments could cause and just know, these are not my actual views about a place I have a lot of."</p>
      <p>In addition to his roles with the BBC and talkSPORT, Mitch also works for the England national football team as their official presenter on their YouTube account.</p>
      <p>Mitch hosted the Lions' Den throughout last summer's World Cup, where the Three Lions made it to the semi-finals.</p>
