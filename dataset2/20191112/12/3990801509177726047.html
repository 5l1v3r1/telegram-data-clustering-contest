        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>I started listening to podcasts around six years ago as a means to kill time during my daily commute. And like every person who’s barely held a guitar and immediately thinks of forming a band, I wanted to start my own podcast.</p>
      <p>I did start one, with a friend who lived a thousand miles away. Both of us recorded on our phones, and I mixed the audio files with <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/">Audacity</a>, a fantastic audio software. It would be an understatement to say the quality was shit. I wish I had a better mic at that time, I might’ve been a podcaster extraordinaire, who knows.</p>
      <p>But you shouldn’t make the same mistake. You should buy the Blue Yeti microphone bundle for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphone-Blackout-Filter-Bundle/dp/B07SZ932T9/?tag=tnw88-20">just $140</a>, down from $224. The deal includes Blue’s renowned Yeti mic, a  Knox Gear pop filter, and a Knox Gear 4-port USB 3.0 hub.</p>
      <p>We’ve used <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2018/10/09/blues-compact-yeti-nano-is-perfect-for-rookie-podcasters-and-streamers/">some of the Blue’s Yeti series of mics</a>, and the results have been impressing. You can record audio at 16-bit for high-quality output. Plus, there are different modes that support recording solo or with multiple people.</p>
      <p>Why are you sitting silently? Get your podcast underway with Blue Yeti microphone bundle for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphone-Blackout-Filter-Bundle/dp/B07SZ932T9/?tag=tnw88-20">just $140</a> ($84 off)</p>
