      <p>After his brace against Borussia Dortmund this past weekend, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski leads the way with 41 club goals in 2019, two ahead of FC Barcelona's captain.</p>
      <p>Messi's incredible hat-trick against Celta Vigo this past Saturday saw his tally shoot to 39 for the calendar year, with those goals coming from just 41 matches. As such, the Argentine has opened the gap on Kylian Mbappe, the player who is next closest to him with 31 strikes.</p>

      <p>Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema has jumped up two places as he continues his excellent goalscoring form across all competitions for Los Blancos. The Frenchman, who is still out of the reckoning for the French national team, has found the back of the net on 30 occasions in 2019.</p>
      <p>Trailing the 31-year-old is Manchester City stalwart Sergio Aguero, whose teammate Raheem Sterling is nearest to him. Their Premier League rival Sadio Mane is hot on their heels, while a new entry in the top 10 is Lazio's Ciro Immobile.</p>
