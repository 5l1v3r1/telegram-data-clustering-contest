      <h1>Duterte in Davao, but no break after all, Palace makes clear</h1>

      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte is not taking a break after all.</h3>
      <p>He flew back to Davao yesterday  and stayed home for around three days but Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo Monday evening said Duterte will continue to work in his hometown.</p>
      <p>The announcement revised his earlier declaration at a media briefing that the president would be in Davao for a “break” of about three days. However, he also said that this schedule was subject to change.</p>
      <p>In his earlier announcement, Panelo said that he did not know if this was based on medical advice, but said that Duterte “lacks sleep”.</p>
      <p>“Palagay ko yun lang kulang niya. Lagi siyang kulang ng tulog,” Panelo said.</p>
      <p>In a later statement, Panelo clarified that Duterte will take some paperwork with him to Davao, and that he will continue working.</p>
      <p>“The President has declined the suggestion of well meaning friends to have a rest for a few days. The Chief Executive will fly to Davao tonight after attending the wake of the late John Gokongwei, Jr. at the Heritage [Park] and will continue working at his residence there,” Panelo said in a statement Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Thankless job</p>
      <p>President Duterte has advised Sen. Manny Pacquiao to carefully mull over any plans to seek the presidency.</p>
      <p>“Kayong mga pulitiko na isipin ninyo mabuti. Manny, I think Manny is entertaining, well it’s good… Pag trabaho wala ka talagang makuha kung ‘di pagod,” Duterte said in a speech during the joint birthday celebration of Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Jay Velasco and his wife.</p>
      <p>(Politicians should think about it carefully. Manny, I think Manny is entertaining, well it’s good… Getting tired is the only thing you get from this work.)</p>
      <p>The boxer-turned-senator was among the guests in the event.</p>
      <p>Duterte reiterated that he would oppose any attempt to get his daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, to run for president in the 2022 elections.</p>
      <p>The chief executive said he would not want his daughter to suffer the same frustrations he has over the presidency.</p>
      <p>“Were it not for the love of country, ‘yun lang talaga magsustain. Wala kang makuha dito sa trabaho na ito except work, work and work and work and work. And worry, worry, worry, and be under stress,” he said.</p>
      <p>(Were it not for the love of country, that’s the only thing that sustains me. You would not get anything from this job except work and worry, and be under stress.)</p>
      <p>Several politicians earlier said they would be willing to back Duterte-Carpio should she want to join the 2022 presidential race.</p>
      <p>Duterte-Carpio earlier said she was not thinking about the presidency. Her father made similar pronouncements in 2016, months before he filed his certificate of candidacy for president at the last minute.</p>
