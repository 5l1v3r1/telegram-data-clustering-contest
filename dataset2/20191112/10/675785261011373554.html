      <h1>Arsenal told to spend £40million to replace Unai Emery with Brendan Rodgers</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal chief Emery is under growing pressure from fans at the Emirates after a disappointing start to the season, but has been publicly backed by the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:15:51+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have been told to spend £40million to snare Brendan Rodgers and replace Unai Emery with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City boss.</p>
      <p>The Gunners inconsistent start to the season continued on Saturday with a 2-0 defeat to Rodgers’ high-flying Foxes.</p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy and James Maddison scored second-half goals to send Leicester second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>By contrast, pressure continues to mount on Emery, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> having won just four of their first 12 league fixtures this term and already sitting eight points behind the top four.</p>
      <p>Gunners chiefs have backed the Spaniard, insisting that they "firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job.</p>

      <p>But ex-Arsenal star Paul Merson retains doubts over Emery’s long-term future, and says Arsenal should go all out to land Rodgers as his replacement.</p>
      <p>“I think he's [Rodgers] one of the best in the business,” Merson told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“If I was Arsenal, I would have been ringing Leicester up and saying, 'how much do you want?'.</p>
      <p>“If you're going to pay £72million for a winger [Pepe] that hasn't played in the Premier League and has played in the French league, I would pay £40million for him tomorrow morning.</p>

      <p>“I would say Arsenal [would be a good fit for Rodgers]. Arsenal or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> . I wouldn't get rid of Pochettino, don't get me wrong, I think he's different class.</p>
      <p>"I think them two teams will be looking at him.</p>
      <p>“For me, if you're going to bring Brendan Rodgers in and what he's done with the teams he has been at like Swansea, Celtic, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and now Leicester, you give him a six-year plan and let him do what he wants to do.</p>
      <p>"He improves players.”</p>
      <p>Merson’s declaration comes after the Arsenal hierarchy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-chiefs-release-statement-over-20861422">sent an impassioned message to staff</a> about his future.</p>
      <p>They told staff: “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect.</p>
      <p>“Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place. We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.</p>
      <p>“We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.”</p>
