      <h1>Ryan Lowe outlines his ambitions for Plymouth Argyle's youth academy</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims' boss believes there are some potentially good players coming through the ranks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:38:46+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle manager Ryan Lowe will be having a large say in the shaping of the club’s youth academy.</p>
      <p>There are going to be changes <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">at Home Park</a> after the departure of academy director Kevin Hodges, which was announced last week.</p>
      <p>How the academy will be run going forward has not been confirmed, but what is clear is that Lowe will be providing a lot of input.</p>
      <p>He has watched a number of the under-18s’ games this season, even taking half-time team talks on occasions.</p>
      <p>Apprentices Jude Boyd and Rubin Wilson have also been given their first team debuts in EFL Trophy ties.</p>
      <p>Lowe wants Argyle to become known not just for the success of their senior side but for their academy too.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims’ boss said: “First and foremost, Kev served the club well. I had a great relationship with him.</p>
      <p>“For me, I want to wish him all the best in what he chooses to do next.</p>
      <p>“In terms of the club going forward, it’s something I’m big on, I have given kids a chance already.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to just have the best team in the league, I want to have the best academy also.</p>
      <p>“When that comes along, definitely I will be a part in hopefully shaping it.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s technical consultant – and Lowe’s mentor – Neil Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy for 17 years.</p>

      <p>Lowe said: “Neil will be helping along the way as well where we need to go with it.</p>
      <p>“Neil is the best in the business. He has run academies for so many years – I won’t tell you how many years, he will shout at me for showing his age.”</p>
      <p>Lowe was asked how important it was for Argyle, a club out on a limb geographically, to develop its own players.</p>
      <p>He replied: “I’m only early in my tenure here. The academy has been okay. We have got some good players.</p>
      <p>“You look at (Adam) Randell, who has been an ever present in the squad this season.</p>
      <p>(Klaidi) Lolos has made appearances, there is Jude Boyd and Rubin Wilson, so there are some players there.</p>
      <p>“Some clubs haven’t even got that but our standards now, we want to have the best.”</p>
      <p>Lowe added: “We have got some good kids in the academy, let’s have it right. We have got some fantastic talent in there.</p>
      <p>“I’m up there most Tuesdays and Thursdays watching them, ranging from nine right the way up.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s apprentices spend a lot of time in and around the first team squad so Lowe has got a good understanding of their abilities and personalities.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “We know all the kids. They have got their own dressing room so they are here (at Home Park) and they have breakfast with us.</p>
      <p>“We know what type of players they are, we know what type of characters they are. We have seen a lot of them.</p>
