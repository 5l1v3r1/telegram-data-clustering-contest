      <p>The matter was previously postponed for Catzavelos' legal team to make representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
      <p>The prosecution revealed during proceedings in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Tuesday that representations had been unsuccessful. </p>
      <p>The video Catzavelos recorded on a Greek beach last year went viral, sparking widespread condemnation.</p>
      <p>In the clip he revelled in the fact there were no black people on the beach.</p>
      <p>He is heard saying: "Not one k***r in sight, f*king heaven on earth... You cannot beat this." </p>
