      <h3>JUSTICE Secretary Menardo Guevarra yesterday directed the Dumaguete City Prosecutor’s Office to seek the issuance of precautionary hold departure order against the other suspects implicated in the killing of radio block timer Dindo Generoso last Thursday in Dumaguete City.</h3>
      <p>Guevarra issued the order after it was earlier reported that an Immigration Lookout Bulletin Order was issued against Tomasino Aledro, one of the suspects in the broadcaster’s murder.</p>
      <p>“All suspects who are still at large, I gave instructions to the OCP regarding the PHDO yesterday (Monday), but the BI was alerted last week pa,” Guevarra said.  </p>
      <p>The ILBO was issued against Aledro  after formal murder charges have been filed against the suspects before the Dumaguete City prosecutor’s office.</p>
      <p>Apart from Aledro, also sued for murder were Teddy Salaw, retired police officer Glen Corsame, and active police officer Roger Rubio.</p>
      <p>Generoso was shot dead by riding in-tandem gunmen at around 7:30 a.m. on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Initial investigation showed that Generoso, 67, of Barangay Banilad in Dumaguete City, was traversing along Hibbard Avenue while on board his car when the suspects shot him several times.</p>
      <p>Generoso, who has a program on Bai Radio, was hit in different parts of the body which led to his death.</p>
