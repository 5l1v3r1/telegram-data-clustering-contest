      <h1>Wyoming Unveils First-Ever Crypto Custody Rules for ‘Blockchain Banks’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:24:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa">United States’</a> state of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/wyoming">Wyoming</a> has unveiled a series of opt-in custody rules for its so-dubbed “blockchain banks,” covering areas such as forks, airdrops and staking. </p>
      <p>The rules were announced during the Fordham Law Blockchain Regulatory Symposium in New York on Nov. 11, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1194022779730968577?s=20">thread of tweets</a> published by Wyoming Blockchain Task Force president Caitlin Long.</p>
      <h3>“First-ever” regulatory provisions for crypto custodians in many areas </h3>
      <p>Wyoming’s “blockchain banks” — legally known as “special purpose depository institutions” (SPDIs) — were <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-state-of-wyoming-passes-two-blockchain-related-bills">approved</a> by the Wyoming state legislature in February of this year and were introduced to serve those businesses unable to secure FDIC-insured banking services due to their dealings with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
      <p>In her tweets, Long — a 22-year Wall Street veteran and cryptocurrency activist — indicated that the newly-released custody rules include what she claims are the first-ever regulatory provisions for digital asset custodians in many areas — including forks, airdrops, staking, customer notice requirements and so forth.</p>
      <p>As regards airdrops, the rules state that all proceeds defined as ancillary/subsidiary —  i.e. those earned via forks, airdrops, staking gains — automatically accrue to the customer, not the custodian, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
      <p>The rules also proscribe SPDIs from authorizing or facilitating the rehypothecation of crypto assets under its custody.  </p>
      <p>According to Long, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U7gIrVwpWElz3C10bC92-33zAKQnS-8E/view">document</a> was reviewed by four crypto sector Chief Technical Officers, alongside multiple Chief Operating Officers and dozens of attorneys.</p>
      <h3>Wyoming’s impressive crypto-legislative activity</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph has extensively <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cowboys-on-the-block-inside-wyomings-race-for-crypto-prominence">reported</a>, America’s least populous state has approved a steady stream of blockchain and cryptocurrency-related legislations.</p>
      <p>In January, Wyoming’s Senate <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wyoming-passes-bill-to-recognize-cryptocurrencies-as-money">passed</a> a bill — later passed by the House on Feb. 14 — allowing for cryptocurrencies to be recognized as money.</p>
      <p>That same month, Wyoming <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-state-of-wyoming-passes-two-new-blockchain-crypto-related-bills">passed</a> a bill defining certain open blockchain tokens as intangible personal property, as well as a bill to establish a fintech regulatory sandbox.</p>
      <p>This February, Wyoming <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-state-of-wyoming-passes-two-blockchain-related-bills">passed</a> two further <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">bills</a> on <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0185">tokenization</a> and industry <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2019/HB0074">compliance</a> — the latter establishing SPDIs.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wyoming-bill-passes-in-state-senate-aims-to-exempt-tokens-from-security-regulations">Wyoming Senate</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wyoming-passes-bill-to-relax-securities-law-for-some-blockchain-tokens">House of Representatives</a> passed a bill relaxing securities regulations and money transmission laws for certain tokens offered via an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico">initial coin offering </a>in the state.</p>
      <p>A separate house bill exempting cryptocurrencies from the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act was <a href="https://legiscan.com/WY/text/HB0019/id/1749784">passed</a> by the state legislature in March 2018, as well as a house bill <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wyoming-introduces-new-bill-to-exempt-crypto-from-property-taxation">exempting</a> them from state property taxation in February. </p>
      <p>Yet, <a href="https://legiscan.com/WY/text/HB0019/id/1749784">further</a> pro-crypto and <a href="https://legiscan.com/WY/bill/HB0101/2018">blockchain</a> senate and house bills had already been <a href="https://legiscan.com/WY/votes/HB0126/2018">passed</a> into Wyoming law.</p>
