      <p>Michael Schumacher’s former manager has claimed that his wife is hiding the truth about the Formula One legend’s condition.</p>
      <p>F1 legend Schumacher suffered a serious brain injury in December 2013 in a skiing accident in the French Alps, which left him in a coma.</p>
      <p>Little has since been revealed about the condition of the seven-time world champion since he moved to being treated at home in September 2014.</p>
      <p>Last month, Willi Weber, his long-term manager, told Munich newspaper TZ last month that Schumacher’s fans should be kept better informed.</p>

      <p>Now, speaking in a German documentary, celebrating the 25th anniversary of Schumacher’s first World Championship in 1994, Weber has claimed that he has made numerous requests to see Schumacher - only for them to be knocked back by wife Corinna.</p>
      <p>And he has stated that Corinna fears the truth about Schumacher’s condition entering the public domain.</p>
      <p>"I know that Michael has been hit hard, but unfortunately I do not know what progress he makes,” Weber states in <i>The Michael Schumacher Tale.</i></p>
      <p>"I’d like to know how he’s doing and shake hands or stroke his face.</p>

      <p>"But unfortunately, this is rejected by Corinna. She’s probably afraid that I’ll see right away what’s going on and make the truth public.</p>
      <p>"I firmly believe in Michael’s recovery, because I know he is a fighter.</p>
      <p>"If there is a chance, he will use it. That cannot be the end.</p>
      <p>"I pray for him and am convinced that we will see him again."</p>
      <p>Corinna, who married Michael in 1995, recently paid tribute to her husband in an interview with She magazine, while discussing her love of horses.</p>
      <p>"When I was 30, I very much wanted to have a horse and Michael went with me to Dubai, where I intended to buy an Arabian horse," she said.</p>
      <p>"He did everything for me. I will never forget who I have to thank. That would be my husband Michael."</p>
