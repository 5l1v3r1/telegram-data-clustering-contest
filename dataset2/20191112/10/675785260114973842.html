      <h1>England stars unhappy with Gareth Southgate over Raheem Sterling punishment</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: England boss Southgate has axed Sterling from the Montenegro clash on Thursday after a flare-up between he and Joe Gomez on Monday at St George's Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>England players wanted the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-gomez">Joe Gomez</a> row kept in house.</p>
      <p>And members of the squad also think there has been an over-reaction to axe Sterling for England’s Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>England boss Gareth Southgate took the unprecedented step of issuing a public statement after Sterling’s flare-up with Gomez at St George’s Park on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mirror Sport can reveal that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> helped mediate peace between the pair as Jordan Henderson stepped in to call Sterling and Gomez, who have since shaken hands after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star apologised.</p>
      <p>However, despite both players insisting they have made up and the row was over very quickly, Southgate shocked the players by deciding not to pick Sterling.</p>

      <p>The flare-up began after Sunday’s title showdown at Anfield when Sterling and Gomez had a row at the end of the game but they made friends and even embraced before leaving the pitch.</p>
      <p>However, Sterling was still simmering a day later when the players reported up at St George’s Park on Monday.</p>

      <p>Gomez was the first Liverpool player to arrive and went to Sterling’s hand but his England team mate was still upset and they had a row.</p>
      <p>Witnesses insist it was over very quickly and Sterling later apologised to Gomez and his England teammates - but it then spiralled out of control and that is what has upset the rest of the squad.</p>
      <p>Southgate held a team meeting and it quickly became clear that he was not willing to leave it at an apology and move on as most players expected him to do.</p>

      <p>Sterling left the training base briefly because he was so upset but soon returned when Liverpool and Henderson stepped in to help play peacemaker.</p>
      <p>Henderson is suspended for the Montenegro game and is not due to report up until Wednesday but made a phone call and got the pair together and peace was restored.</p>
      <p>Henderson has also volunteered to go to St George’s Park on Tuesday to see his Liverpool team mate and also Sterling who he remains good friends with from days together at Anfield.</p>

      <p>However, Southgate was not ready to leave the matter and news of the row leaked out but the FA took the unusual step of deciding to put out a statement.</p>
      <p>That is out of keeping with the norm as even last month when James Maddison was pictured in a casino after being sent home ill from England duty nothing was said by the FA until Southgate addressed the issue.</p>
      <p>However, the statement issued by the FA and Southgate was strong as he insisted it was important to stop “club rivalries” and then explained that was why Sterling would not be picked as feelings were still “raw.”</p>
      <p>But the feeling from some players is that has effectively thrown Sterling under the bus which is harsh treatment against a popular and also an experienced member of the group.</p>
      <p>Players feel such rows and flare-ups happen at club level on a regular basis and there is a feeling that it was weak management on Southgate’s part, especially when he could look to get back into club football in the future.</p>
      <p>Sterling later issued a statement on social media insisting the matter was over quickly, he has made amends with Gomez and expressed regret for the flashpoint.</p>
      <p>But it would seem Southgate has not been able to move on from the row - even at the risk of his stern actions upsetting some players.</p>
