      <h3>AN alleged Italian pedophile accused of preying on Filipino minors in the South during his frequent visits to the country was arrested in Davao City by the Bureau of Immigration (BI).</h3>
      <p>In his report to BI Commissioner Jaime Morente, BI Acting Intelligence Chief Fortunato Manahan, Jr. identified the alien as Lorenzo Marchesi, 57.  He was nabbed last November 8 at the Davao International Airport (DIA).</p>
      <p>According to Manahan, Marchesi was about to leave when he was intercepted at the airport by officers and intelligence agents who prevented him from boarding his flight due to a mission order for his arrest that was issued against him by Morente.  </p>
      <p>A mission order was issued against Marchesi based on information about the latter’s immoral activities which make him an undesirable alien.</p>
      <p>Marchesi is also said to be a respondent in several criminal complaints filed with the Davao City prosecutor’s office and Philippine National Police’s women and children’s protection desk.   Said complaints range from alleged violation of the expanded anti-trafficking act, cyber crime law, and anti-child abuse act, as well as engaging minors for sexual acts in exchange for money.</p>
      <p>It was learned that a deportation charge for undesirability was already filed against the alien by BI prosecutors before the bureau’s board of commissioners.</p>
