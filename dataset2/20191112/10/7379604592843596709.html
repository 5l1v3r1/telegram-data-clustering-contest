        <b>FORMER EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa intends to use her stint on I’m A Celebrity to prove that she’s not a “pushover”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is married to ex-Towie star Dan Osborne but, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/6349316/jacqueline-jossa-dan-osborne-split/">following a series of affair allegations</a>, the actress has admitted she thinks “some people see me as a pushover or doormat – I am not”.</p>

      <p>Now, going on the hit ITV reality show, Jacqueline has opened up on the public perception of her, suggesting she is more “up for a laugh” than people think.</p>
      <p>“I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best,” she said.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline has two children – four-year-old Ella and 17-month-old Mia – with Dan, and is also step-mother to his son Teddy.</p>
      <p>The pair, who’ve been rocked by cheating accusations since marrying in June 2017, are thought to be hoping the six-week break will bring them closer together – just like when Dan went into Celebrity Big Brother.</p>

        <figcaption>Jacqueline has two daughters and is stepmother to Dan’s son Teddy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They split in 2018 after a series of rows over Dan allegedly kissing Love Island star Alexandra Crane on a night out.</p>
      <p>Their marriage was also strained when he began working away from home on a fitness camp with another Love Island star, Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>Marcel Somerville then accused girlfriend Gabby of cheating with Dan while they were still together, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8715385/gabby-allen-dan-osborne-friendship-jacqueline-jossa-deserves-more/">something which they both denied.</a></p>
      <p>Jacqueline and Dan were back on by June 2018 and a source close to the pair told The Sun that they believe “that being apart while she’s on the show will mean they’re closer than ever when she comes back to the UK – absence makes the heart grow fonder and all that”.</p>

      <p>However Jacqueline has said that the hardest part of her time in the jungle will be not seeing her girls.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to face even telling them. In the end, I thought the best idea was to say ‘mummy is going away for work’ and I would see them soon. My family is so close-knit and I will miss them all terribly,” she added.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10326885/im-a-celebrity-jacqueline-jossa-spiders/">the first I’m A Celebrity advert</a> featuring the 2019 all-star line-up, the mum-of-two shared that she doesn’t “really know why I’m doing the jungle actually”.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like heights, I don’t like spiders, I’m not the best swimmer…</p>
      <p>She added: “I’m dramatic so there will be screams and there will definitely be tears. There will be noises you probably haven’t heard before.”</p>
