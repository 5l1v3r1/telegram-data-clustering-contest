      <h1>VAR chief hails impact technology has had on Premier League and scores system 7/10</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was left fuming after Liverpool's VAR-assisted 3-1 defeat of his side at Anfield on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:44:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Swarbrick - the Premier League’s head of VAR - has been impressed with the impact of the technology this season despite another weekend of controversy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> manager Pep Guardiola was left fuming after Liverpool's VAR-assisted 3-1 defeat of his side at Anfield on Sunday, in which his side had two penalty appeals rejected.</p>
      <p>Another controversial VAR incident occurred on Saturday at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , in which Sheffield United were denied a goal for the tightest of offside decisions.</p>
      <p>And, despite several controversial decisions and criticism from fans and pundits, Swarbrick defended the technology.</p>
      <p>He said: "I’m really pleased, honestly, with how we have started out. We have more decisions correct with VAR than without it.</p>

      <p>"I’d give us around about seven-ish. If the mark now is seven — early days — in two years’ time I’m hoping for maybe a eight and a half or nine. We are open to evolving with this.</p>
      <p>"It’s not a case of we’re not budging. We will listen to feedback. I’m comfortable with where we are but there’s no doubt there’s room for improvement. It’s a work in progress."</p>
      <p>VAR was introduced in the Premier League this season after trials in the League Cup and FA Cup.</p>

      <p>He added: "We are in the infancy with VAR, 12 match weeks into the Premier League season, and you need to give us time to operate and utilise it.</p>
      <p>"It is working as we wanted. It's taken quite a few years for other competitions or sports - the likes of cricket and rugby union - to get to where they are today regarding technology. It doesn't happen overnight."</p>
      <p>Some pundits were less enthralled with the system which has also infuriated fans around the world, mostly for decision-making delays which take up to several minutes.</p>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> striker Chris Sutton was one of the system's harshest critics.</p>
      <p>"Seven out of 10? Did he really say that with a straight face? Come on, are you serious?" Sutton told the BBC.</p>
      <p>"There have been so many high-profile, horrific mistakes. They've got too much wrong. I wanted VAR to work, I backed VAR, but they are making such a mess of it."</p>
