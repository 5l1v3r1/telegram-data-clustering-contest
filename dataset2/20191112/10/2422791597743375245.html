      <h1>Chemical attack at kindergarten in China injures 51 children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:26:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Hollingsworth, CNN</a></address>
      <p>Fifty-one children and three teachers were injured at a kindergarten in southwest <a href="https://cnn.com/china">China</a> when a man attacked them with a corrosive chemical, state media <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138548515.htm">reported</a> Tuesday.</p>
      <p>According to state-run news agency Xinhua, a 23-year-old suspect surnamed Kong climbed into the school in Kaiyuan city, Yunnan province, on Monday afternoon and sprayed caustic soda on a room full of students and teachers.</p>
      <p>Two of those hit were seriously hurt, although their injuries are not life-threatening, the report said.</p>
      <p>The suspect was detained about an hour after the attack. He allegedly sprayed the chemical as an act of revenge on society, Xinhua quoted police as saying.</p>
      <p>Caustic soda -- also known as sodium hydroxide -- is used in the manufacturing of a number of common products, including soap, paper, and various dyes.</p>
      <p>According to the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exposure to caustic soda can <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/sodium-hydroxide/default.html">irritate or burn the eyes and skin</a>, provoke an allergic reaction, or even cause temporary hair loss.</p>
      <h3>History of violence</h3>
      <p>Monday's incident is not the first school attack to take place in China. In October 2018, a <a href="https://cnn.com/2018/10/26/asia/chongqing-kindergarten-china-intl/index.html">woman wielding a kitchen knife</a> slashed at least 14 children at a kindergarten in the central city of Chongqing.</p>
      <p>Nine students <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/asia/china-middle-school-knife-killings/index.html">were killed</a> at a middle school in Shaanxi province in April 2018 by a 28-year-old man who was later <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/27/c_137496517.htm">sentenced to death</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2017, 11 students were injured after a man climbed over the wall of a kindergarten with a knife and began attacking them.</p>
