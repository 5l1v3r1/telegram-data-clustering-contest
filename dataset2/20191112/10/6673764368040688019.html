      <p>In early 2004, two massive Estonians moved to Japan to join professional sumo.</p>
      <p>Ott Juurikas became a member of the Irumagawa stable but was complaining about feeling out of place almost immediately, and after just a single outing, he quit the sport and returned home.</p>
      <p>Juurikas compiled a 5-2 record in that tournament with one of his losses coming to compatriot Kaido Hoovelson.</p>
      <p>Initially finding a place in the Mihogaseki stable, Hoovelson went 7-0 in his debut, and rocketed up the rankings, reaching the paid ranks just over a year later.</p>
      <p>Standing 198 cm and far outweighing most of the rikishi in the lower divisions, Hoovelson physically dominated opponents on his way to the upper reaches of the sport.</p>
      <p>His signature move was reaching both hands over the back of shorter rikishi and lifting them crane-like out of the ring.</p>
      <p>The unorthodox technique required huge strength but also placed a lot of strain on joints and as a result Baruto (his ring name coming from the Baltic region) suffered from continual and lingering knee problems.</p>
      <p>Baruto, who retired in 2013, managed to reach the sport’s second-highest rank and win a championship despite those obstacles and while he was a terrifying sight inside the ring, outside it he was a gentle giant.</p>
      <p>It was rare to encounter a Baruto that wasn’t smiling or joking around. His laid-back demeanor made him very popular among the general public, but occasionally led to tensions with more serious-minded members of the sumo world.</p>
      <p>Outside the ring his hobbies included collecting rare gold coins and playing pachinko.</p>
      <p>Post retirement his interest in new and different things has only increased. The Rakvere native has been by turns a farmer, actor, MMA fighter, tourism ambassador and politician.</p>
      <p>Currently a member of parliament, Baruto has intimated to friends that his ambition is to eventually become president of Estonia.</p>
