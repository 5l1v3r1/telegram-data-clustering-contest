      <p>EA Access subscribers will not get the service's standard free trial offer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</p>
      <p>In a rare exception to EA's offering, the publisher has decided not to let subscribers try the game ahead of its official launch on Friday.</p>
      <p>EA Access is supposed to give 10 hours of early access to all new EA games. But the publisher has decided to pull this offer for Star Wars in a move it blamed on reducing spoilers.</p>
      <p>"We've opted not to have early/timed access (Play First Trial), in part to reduce the risk of spoilers," EA said in a tweet last night. "Instead, EA Access members get these exclusive cosmetics!"</p>

      <p>EA promotes its Early Trials as one of the three main reasons you should subscribe to EA Access, along with a 10 per cent discount on digital game purchases and access to EA's vault of older games.</p>
      <p>The publisher does not usually withold a trial from single-player games. EA Access subscribers could previously play 10 hours of Mass Effect Andromeda, for example - although that trial gained a mixed reaction.</p>
