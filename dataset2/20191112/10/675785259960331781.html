      <h2>Liverpool skipper Henderson called both players to defuse the situation which arose at St George's Park on Monday morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:15:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson acted as the peacemaker in the Raheem Sterling vs Joe Gomez row - despite having not yet joined up with the England squad.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez clashed at St George's Park on Monday the day after a heated exchange between the duo on the pitch as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Forward Sterling took issue with Gomez's offer of a handshake - from behind - and attempted to grab the defender before teammates stepped in following a verbal row.</p>
      <p>Henderson is suspended for England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro on Thursday and is due to join up with the rest of the squad on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>But that didn't stop the Reds captain from intervening - calling both players individually to get them together for a handshake.</p>
      <p>Sterling has subsequently apologised for the incident but has been dropped from the squad for the Montenegro game - a punishment some England stars see as unnecessary.</p>
      <p>The Man City winger is understood to be unhappy at the punishment as he insists the situation has been resolved.</p>

      <p>In a statement posted on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page on Monday night, Sterling wrote: "First and foremost everyone knows what this game means to me!</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that I am not that way inclined and more to the point, both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on.</p>
      <p>"We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions get the better of me.</p>
      <p>"We move this is why we play this sport because of our love for it - me and @joegomez5 are good we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing it's done we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>"Let's get focus on our game on Thursday."</p>
