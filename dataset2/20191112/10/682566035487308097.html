      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> coach <b>Molefi Ntseki </b>says that his charges will need to implement a strategy that will curb <b>Ghana's</b> attacking prowess.</p>
      <p>South Africa travel to the west African nation to face the Black Stars in a <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) </b>qualifier on Thursday when the two sides meet at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>"We have to be very careful. Starting on the front foot can get us an early goal and unsettle Ghana. But at the same time if you give Ghana too much possession, they can easily hurt you," Ntseki said as quoted by <b>BusinessLIVE </b><a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/sport/soccer/2019-11-11-bafana-coach-ntseki-opts-for-caution-and-experience-in-ghana/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>"They are at home‚ they will have the support and the confidence. So, it’s a game where one has to be very cautious.</p>
      <p>"We need to manage the phases of the game very well. That is why we are talking of players with experience‚ players who have been here before‚ players who have played at the highest level. I’m referring to the Afcon.</p>
      <p>"These are the players who did very well against Egypt. These are the players who did very well against Nigeria in Nigeria (with a 2-1 win in the 2019 Afcon qualifiers in Uyo in June 2017)," said the coach.</p>
      <p>"So, we are very careful in our approach. Our tactical strategy has to be one of being protective‚ but at the same time we should not be dropping too deep and giving Ghana possession‚ because they can always be dangerous."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lebogang Manyama has been called up to the Bafana squad for their two crucial clashes against Ghana and Sudan.</p>
      <p>Manyama replaces the injured Themba Zwane from Mamelodi Sundowns as the squaf assembled for camp on Sunday and departed to Accra on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>This will be Bafana Bafana's 12th meeting against the Black Stars of Ghana.</p>
      <p>Thursday's match starts at 21:00 (SA time).</p>
