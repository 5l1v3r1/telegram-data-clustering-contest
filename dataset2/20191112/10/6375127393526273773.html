      <h1>Tough task ahead for these ‘92 PMAers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:25:56+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/alfred-p-dalizon" target="_blank">Alfred P. Dalizon</a></address>
      <h3>I’M referring to my good friends  Colonel Romeo ‘Bong’ Caramat Jr. and Col. Ronald Lee, both tough officers from the Philippine Military Academy ‘Tanglaw-Diwa’ Class of 1992 who have been named by PNP Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa as new directors respectively of the PNP Drug Enforcement Group and the PNP Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group.</h3>
      <p>As I have previously written, the two ‘silently’ assumed their new positions, without any official turnover ceremony usually associated with key PNP units over two weeks ago, making them the newest members of PMA Class 1992 to occupy positions of major responsibility in the PNP which will qualify them for promotion to star-rank.</p>
      <p>The 1st member of PMA Class 1992 in the PNP to earn a star-rank  is  PNP spokesman and head of the PNP Public Information Office, now Brig. Gen. Bernie  Banac. Two other members of the Class who are set to earn their star-rank soon are Col. Jonnel Estomo of the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group and Col. Matthew Baccay of the PNP Legal Service.</p>
      <p>Due to their solid service reputation, Lee and Caramat got their new posts wherein they will be playing major roles in the PNP’s effort to regain some lost trust and confidence of the country in the aftermath of the ‘Ninja Cops’ controversy which forced the resignation of former PNP chief, Gen. Oscar Albayalde.</p>
      <p>As PNP-IMEG director, Lee has been ordered by the PNP leadership to ensure a no let-up drive against rogues in uniform specifically targeting policemen directly or indirectly involved in illegal drug activities and other irregularities.   Two days after he assumed his new post, Lee’s men went to work and arrested two Pasay City policemen accused of extorting money from bus and FX operators and drivers in Malibay area.</p>
      <p>The head of the Pasay City Police-Community Precinct, Captain Mark Oyad was also relieved by NCRPO director, Brig. Gen. Dodong Sinas after he and his men were accused of demanding daily ‘grease money’ from public transport operators and drivers in their jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>The relieved Pasay City PCP7 commander also has a lot of explaining to do after he was accused of threatening to arrest and file drug-related charges against the head of a local transport group who protested his alleged instruction to increase their daily collection to P1,000 per trip. This is a serious allegation which is now being investigated by the NCRPO on orders of an angry Brig. Gen. Sinas.</p>
      <p>Under Caramat, the PNP-IMEG from February 3, 2017 to date launched counter-intelligence operations which led in the killing of nine scalawags in shootouts and the arrest and filing of charges against 226 others.  </p>
      <p>Since he took over as PNP-DEG director, Caramat’s men have already accounted for five known ‘high-value targets’ in three separate anti-narcotics operations in the country.</p>
      <p>Two of the suspects identified as Emerson Fernandez, a 39-year old resident of Barangay San Francisco, General Trias, Cavite and Peter Lanuzga,46, of San Martin de Forres, Parañaque City were arrested after they conspired to sell  some six kilograms of the so-called ‘poor man’s cocaine’ worth an estimated P40.8 million to an undercover officer in front of the McDonald’s Restaurant in Baclaran, Pasay City.</p>
      <p>The 3rd identified as Merasol Bonane,41, was arrested in Cebu City during an entrapment operation which led in the confiscation of over a kilo of suspected shabu valued at P6.9 million and the marked money from the suspect. The two others are both 18-year old teenagers who were arrested in another sting in Cebu City which led in the recovery of 40 heat-sealed plastic sachets containing around 730 grams of shabu.</p>
      <p>Last Monday, Caramat told me he was scheduled to pay a courtesy call on former PNP chief-turned Senator Panfilo ‘Ping’ Lacson. He said he was very honored to pay a visit on the highly-respected member of PMA Class 1971 and wish he would learn more from the good senator when it comes to fighting drugs and rogues in uniform.</p>
      <p>The official told me his wish: to have a powerful PAOCTF or Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force under then Gen. Lacson which sowed terror among criminals and misfits and scalawags in the police force but endeared its members and the rest of the police force to the general public from 1999 to January 2001.</p>
      <p>A bemedalled officer who narrowly missed being adjudged as this year’s Best Senior Police Commissioned Officer for Operations, Caramat is expected to get his star-rank at the PNP-DEG soon while in the center of a much aggressive crackdown against ‘high-value targets’ in the illegal drug industry.</p>
      <p>It means he has to work double time to get the ‘big fishes’ or the shabu manufacturers, importers and traffickers in the country. Given all the support he deserves, I know that Caramat won’t fail since he has proven himself when he was still the Bulacan police director until he was assigned to the PNP-IMEG.</p>
      <p>Same with Lee, a former Pangasinan police director who is known for his very good stint with the Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response (now known as the PNP Anti-Kidnapping Group), the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, the PNP Highway Patrol Group and most especially, the PNP Intelligence Group. I hope and pray  too that very soon, the PNP-IMEG director’s rank will be upgraded to a Brigadier General by the National Police Commission.</p>
      <p>Caramat  and Lee are also partnering to  go after rogues in uniform who are directly or indirectly involved in illegal drug trafficking and abuse. Expect both Caramat and Lee to further strengthen their counter-intelligence sections as they perform their new tasks. These two are ‘palaban.’ Mark my word.</p>
