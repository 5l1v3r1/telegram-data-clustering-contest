      <h1>Opposition says may challenge EC ruling on campaign walkabouts</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 — The Opposition said today it may take legal action against the Election Commission over its ruling for political parties to obtain police permit for election walkabouts.</p>
      <p>“We will look at the legal aspect and if the EC had acted beyond the law, we may challenge it in court if not for the coming Tanjung Piai by-election, for future ones,” Opposition leader Datuk Ismail Sabri Yaakob told reporters at the Parliament lobby today.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, EC chairman Datuk Azhar Harun said walkabouts were also considered a form of campaigning and, as such, their times and locations should be made clear for monitoring purposes.</p>
      <p>He said EC officials had met with the Pontian police chief to clarify and coordinate issues related to permits and campaigning rules where walkabouts are concerned.</p>
      <p>Ismail Sabri then complained that the ruling was made without any consultation from candidates representative and other stakeholders.</p>
      <p>“Usually the candidates representatives would be consulted before any new ruling is issued.</p>
      <p>“But in this instance, we were only received a letter informing of the ruling,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ismail Sabri, who is also Umno vice president also questioned the timing of the EC ruling, and whether it gave PH and unfair advantage in the Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>“I don’t understand why the ruling cropped up during the Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>“Is it because Pakatan Harapan is finding the road to victory hard and the EC is now assisting them by making it difficult for the other parties?” he said.</p>
