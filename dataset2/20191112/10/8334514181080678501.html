      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - French billionaire Xavier Niel said on Tuesday he was ready to pour 1.4 billion euros into Iliad (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ILD.PA">ILD.PA</a>) to show his commitment to the telecoms group he founded and majority owns, despite several tough quarters and a share price plunge.</p>

      <p>Iliad, whose cut-price phone deals shook up France’s mobile market, was beaten at its own game in recent quarters as a price war dented its market share, undermined its profitability and more than halved the value of shares in the past two years.</p>
      <p>Niel, who owns a little more than 52% of Iliad, said in a call with analysts that he heard the frustration of some of the group’s shareholders but that he still believed in its strategy.</p>
      <p>He said he would fully underwrite a 1.4 billion euro capital increase to finance a share buyback equivalent to nearly 20% of shares, offering disgruntled shareholders a way out.</p>
      <p>“I have been disappointed as the first shareholder of the group by the stock price performance over the last few months,” Niel said.</p>
      <p>“But I believe in the group, its management, its prospects in France and of course in Italy. I’m keen to increase my exposure in the group,” he said.</p>
      <p>The share buyback program will be carried out at the price of 120 euros per share, a premium of 38% on the basis of the volume-weighted average price over the last three months. The stock closed at 95.06 euros on Monday and rose 17% on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The offer will concern about 11.7 million shares, or 19.7% of the group’s capital, which Chief Executive Thomas Reynaud said could mean Niel’s stake would rise to 72%, in the absence of any offer from new shareholders.</p>
      <p>The group, which competes against Orange (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ORAN.PA">ORAN.PA</a>), Altice Europe’s SFR (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ATCA.AS">ATCA.AS</a>) and Bouygues Telecom (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BOUY.PA">BOUY.PA</a>) in France, said in a separate statement that third-quarter revenue rose 8% to 1.34 billion euros.</p>
      <p>The growth stemmed from the addition of 32,000 new customers who subscribed to its high-speed broadband offers and 150,000 new mobile customers for its 4G mobile offers.</p>
      <p>Iliad also indicated it would pay 2.6 euros per share in dividend. It confirmed its full-year targets, including a return to revenue growth in France and an acceleration of its core operating profit growth in the second-half of the year.</p>
