      <p>A toddler who was struck by an air conditioning unit that fell from a building in Scarborough on Monday has died in hospital, police confirm.</p>
      <p>Officers were called to an apartment complex on Lawrence Avenue East, near Mossbank Drive, shortly before 4 p.m. to assist a young girl who had been injured.</p>
      <p>Police say a woman was entering the complex with her three children when an AC unit came out of the window of an eighth-floor apartment.</p>
      <p>The AC unit, police say, landed directly on woman’s two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>The girl’s two siblings, who are ages five and seven, witnessed the tragic incident.</p>
      <p>The injured toddler was rushed to hospital in critical condition but police confirmed Tuesday that she has since died of her injuries.</p>
      <p>Police are searching for witnesses and are reviewing surveillance footage to try and determine the sequence of events.</p>
      <p>No charges have been laid and police say the investigation is ongoing.</p>
