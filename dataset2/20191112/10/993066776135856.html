      <p>Simon Cowell has denied holding a grudge against Little Mix, after he announced he is launching another version of the X Factor to rival the girl group’s upcoming talent show.</p>
      <p>The music mogul, who celebrated his 60th birthday last month, said he owed the band “a lot” but that “sometimes you want to be the first one to do it”.</p>
      <p>Cowell reportedly axed a proposed X Factor: All Stars series, which had been set to premiere next month and feature previous winners including Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke.</p>

      <p>Instead, he will premiere X Factor: The Band to find all-male and all-female groups.</p>
      <p>It will be a direct rival to The Search, the talent show set to be launched by Little Mix on BBC One next year.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Amanda Holden and Jamie Theakston’s Heart radio show, Cowell said he had always intended to launch a group version of the X Factor in the UK and had simply fast-tracked the project.</p>
      <p>He told fellow Britain’s Got Talent judge Holden: “We have worked together for 14 years. It’s the same with music, radio, TV. Sometimes you have just got to do something quick.</p>
      <p>“I have a group show which I launched in America four or five years ago. We had always decided to do a group show in the UK.</p>

      <p>“We had agreed with ITV that we were going to do the X Factor groups in 2020. That was all fine. Then we were going to do the all-stars version this year.</p>
      <p>“Then when we found out that the Little Mix show was going to go out in 2020 I didn’t want to follow their show since we had already planned it years ago.</p>
      <p>“I thought, well, we will just bring it forward. Simple as that. It wasn’t like some grudge against Little Mix or whatever, because I owe those girls a lot.</p>
      <p>“Even though we gave them a launch pad, they sold a lot of records. I thought their idea was a great idea but sometimes you want to be the first one to do it.”</p>
      <p>Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall won the 2011 series of the X Factor as a group having been formed on the show after originally auditioning as solo singers.</p>

      <p>They were signed to Cowell’s record label Syco Music but parted ways last year.</p>
      <p>Cowell also suggested that in the future the X Factor’s original, group and celebrity versions could rotate on a yearly basis.</p>
      <p>He also hinted he would be making an announcement of “very good news” about Britain’s Got Talent “very shortly”.</p>
