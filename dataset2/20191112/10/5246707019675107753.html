      <p>Headup Games' <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bloo_kid_2">Bloo Kid 2</a></b> has received a fixed release date on Nintendo Switch. You'll be able to get your hands on it from 18th November.</p>
      <p>We first reported on this one <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/07/old-school_platformer_bloo_kid_2_makes_the_jump_to_switch">back in July</a> this year, when it was revealed that the game would be making the jump to Switch from 3DS. We awarded the 3DS version <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/3ds-eshop/bloo_kid_2">a healthy 7/10</a> back in the day, so this could well be worth your time on Nintendo's latest machine.</p>
      <p>Here's a quick description:</p>
      <blockquote>Bloo Kid 2 is a classic 2D retro-style platformer experience with lovely designed pixel-graphics and a full chiptune soundtrack. Run, jump and swim your way through five huge worlds with twelve levels each. Master brutal boss fights and discover lots of secrets in the world of Bloo Kid 2.</blockquote>
