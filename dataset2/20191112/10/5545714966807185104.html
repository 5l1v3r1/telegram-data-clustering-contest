      <h1>Nintendo: Don't expect a price cut for the Switch anytime soon</h1>
      <h2>'We want to maintain the value of our products'</h2>

      <p>Recently Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../nintendo-announces-digital-says-are-way-up-cites-smash-ultimate-fighter-s-pass-as-a-huge-boost-572201.phtml">announced that Nintendo's enhanced focused on digital content</a> (on top of DLC) was paying dividends, but don't expect the publisher to pass those savings on to hardware discounts.</p>
      <p>Speaking in that same digital discussion Q&amp;A, Furukawa responded to the question of whether or not Nintendo would "lower the price of the Nintendo Switch itself in the next year or two," with a very simple answer: no. Furukawa says that the company wants to "maintain the value" of their products, and sell them at "the current price points" for as long as possible. Citing a less investor-sating reason, he notes that "profitability can fluctuate depending on quantities produced in the future," so Nintendo isn't counting on a cost decrease. Instead they'll keep driving at selling more Switch units.</p>
      <p>The bottom line? The literal question that was asked was whether or not the Switch would see a price decrease in the next "year or two," and the company president said no. Now Nintendo changes their tune all the time, so if a theoretical Switch Pro comes along at E3 2020 or E3 2021, they'd basically <i>have</i> to decrease the price of the base Switch to help justify said Pro. For now, taken at absolute face value, that won't happen until 2022-ish.</p>
