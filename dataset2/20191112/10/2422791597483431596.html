      <p>ANKARA, Turkey -- A Turkish official says authorities are working to understand how a former British officer who helped found the White Helmets volunteer aid group in Syria died.</p>
      <p>James Le Mesurier was found dead near his home in Istanbul on Monday. Turkish police believe he fell to his death and are investigating the circumstances.</p>
      <p>Istanbul governor Ali Yerlikaya told reporters Tuesday: "Our chief prosecutor's office, our police are engaged in multifaceted efforts to shed light on the incident."</p>
      <p>Le Mesurier was the founder and CEO of May Day Rescue, which established and trained the White Helmets, also known as the Syria Civil Defence, a group of local humanitarian volunteers.</p>
      <p>Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency reported he was 48 and had moved to Turkey with his wife four years ago.</p>
