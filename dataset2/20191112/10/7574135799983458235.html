      <p><b>Wye Oak</b> are back with a new single that’s one of the more immediately appealing tracks that they’ve released in a while. A lot of their music soars, but “Fortune” flies with a little more confidence, from Jenn Wasner’s multi-layered harmony to the big rock wordless chorus that rips the sky wide open. “Life is change. Change is loss,” says Wasner. “This song is about how hard it is to let go, and the feeling of celebrating and mourning it all at once.” You can listen to “Fortune” below.</p>
      <p>Speaking of big, Wye Oak have also just announced a tour, called JOIN, that will not only feature a four-to-six member expanded lineup of the group, but will also see them performing songs by Wasner’s solo project <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/flock-of-dimes-celebrated-her-new-album-at-rough-trade-with-katie-harkin-pics/">Flock of Dimes</a> and Andy Stack’s solo project <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/12-new-songs-out-today-18/">Joyero</a>.
