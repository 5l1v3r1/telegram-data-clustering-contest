      <p>NEW DELHI: Not all relationships are created equal — some require more paperwork than others. Last week, McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook was abruptly fired for having a consensual relationship with a subordinate, which violated their employee code of conduct. While he’s leaving with a sweet severance package, it does raise questions about what this means for the future of the office romance.</p>
      <p>While the majority of Indian companies don’t entirely prohibit workplace relationships, the rules around the blending of personal and professional lives are getting tighter. Antony Alex, founder and CEO of Rainmaker, which holds prevention of sexual harassment (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/PoSH">PoSH</a>) trainings and workshops, says that many companies require employees to disclose their relationship to Human Resources.</p>
      <p>In the case of a subordinate and manager, it is almost always mandatory. “Individuals who fall within what is called the matrix of power are required to let the company know. This is not only if a direct manager and employee are in a relationship, but also if you’re higher up in the hierarchy,” says Alex. Other companies have policies that require even peers to disclose a relationship, and a smaller number make them sign <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/dating-disclosure">dating disclosure</a> forms, he adds.</p>
      <p>“We have a policy in place that requires disclosure. It is applicable to anyone where there is a personal conflicting relationship that actually or potentially impairs the employee’s objectivity and judgment,” says Unmesh Pawar, partner and head of ‘people, performance and culture’ at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/KPMG">KPMG</a> India.</p>
      <p>This change began before the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Me-Too-movement">Me Too movement</a>, but gained greater momentum after it, says Nirmala Menon, founder and CEO of Interweave Consulting, an HR consultancy. “Earlier, if you were in a relationship or got married, one person would have to quit the organisation. Then people began to feel that keeping couples worked well as a retention strategy. About 12-15 years ago, some companies also started something called a dating allowance.” That’s basically pocket money to go on dates. She adds, “This was a way to appeal to the younger generation, but they figured out it wasn’t the best idea.”</p>
      <p>Relationships between subordinates and superiors are the most problematic, says Devika Singh, co-founder of Cohere Consultants, a firm that works with companies to ensure PoSH compliance. “When there’s a power dynamic, it can lead to favouritism, and non-professional decisions,” she says.</p>
      <p>If the couple is in the same team that could also lead to issues, says Pallavi Pareek, founder of Ungender, which advises companies on PoSH and gender laws compliance. Even when there’s a relationship between peers, employees must make sure they don’t create an uncomfortable work environment for others. “In some companies, the use of company resources to further a romantic relationship is strictly prohibited,” adds Pareek. This means not sending love notes on work email, no staying together on work trips and no PDA in office.</p>
      <p>The fallout of non-disclosure also depends on one’s place in the organisation. “The more senior you are in the hierarchy, like if you’re a CEO or senior VP, the consequences will be greater,” says Menon.</p>
      <p>Another situation where problems commonly arise is if the couple breaks up. Singh says that in the 1,500 ICC cases she’s dealt with, about 15-20% have to do with consensual relationships gone bad. This can mean one party constantly stopping by another’s workstation in an attempt to get them back, and it can also take a darker turn. “I saw a case where a manager had gotten into a relationship with a subordinate, and she got pregnant. He then revealed that he was married. He booked a hotel room on company money and beat her up to get her to miscarry,” she says.</p>
      <p>Disclosure is not only a matter of protecting the company from liability, but keeps the employees in question safe too. “If a consensual relationship stops, and there is harassment, people need to be able to show the ICC committee proof, for instance, text messages that show that they had ended it or communicated that they don’t want to engage,” says Pareek.</p>
      <p>Of the 300-odd companies she has worked with, about half have added clauses about consensual relationships in their PoSH policy. Many companies have no rules about dating in place yet, but those tend to be family businesses or startups. Larger companies, particularly MNCs, tend to have some clauses addressing office romance, as do any smaller companies that intend to become big, says Pareek; “a preventative thought process is settling in.”</p>
      <p>Not surprising since office romances are far from uncommon. A 2012 Randstad study showed that 70% of Indian employees reported some kind of romance with a co-worker. Rajneesh Singh, managing partner at HR consultancy Simply HR, believes they are on the rise. “As women enter the workforce in larger numbers, these relationships will happen more often. It’s not just between two single people, we also hear about cases where both parties are married, or one is married and the other is unmarried,” says Singh, who quit his HR gig at a motor company with a strict non-fraternisation policy, to get married. It’s not always complicated though. “I have also seen relationships blossom and grow, and couples who get married,” he adds.</p>
