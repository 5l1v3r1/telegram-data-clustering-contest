      <h1>Seahawks’ Tyler Lockett ‘should be OK’ after hospital visit, Pete Carroll says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:03:34+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/adam-jude/" target="_blank">Adam Jude</a></address>
      <p>Seahawks star receiver Tyler Lockett “should be OK” after his visit to Stanford Hospital late Monday night because of severe swelling in his leg.</p>
      <p>Seahawks coach Pete Carroll provided a general update on Lockett’s injury during his Tuesday morning radio show on 710 ESPN Seattle.</p>
      <p>“He should be OK,” Carroll said. “It shouldn’t be a big problem going forward. … There’s concern there could be some complications when you have something like that.”</p>
      <p>After the Seahawks’ overtime victory at San Francisco, Carroll said there was concern about possible compartment syndrome in Lockett’s leg because of the swelling caused by a contusion in the receiver’s lower left leg.</p>
      <p>Carroll did not provided details beyond that Tuesday, but he did sound optimistic that Lockett wouldn’t be out long-term.</p>
      <p>Lockett has emerged not only as the Seahawks’ No. 1 receiver this season but one of the best in the NFL — with a career-high 62 catches for 793 yards and six touchdowns this season.</p>
      <p>Tight end Luke Willson left Monday’s game with a hamstring injury, and Carroll also was encouraged that that injury wouldn’t be long-term either. Beyond that, the Seahawks came out relatively healthy heading into their bye week.</p>
