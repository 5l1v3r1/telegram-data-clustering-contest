      <p>Canadian politician Catherine Dorion has inspired a backlash on social media after being forced to leave the National Assembly in Quebec because she was wearing a hoodie. </p>
      <p>Dorion, who is a member of the left-wing Quebec Solidaire party and represents the district of Taschereau, entered the halls of the legislature on 7 November in an orange sweatshirt and jeans. </p>
      <p>Her outfit sparked complaints from colleagues so Dorion decided to leave the office as she didn’t want to “cause a scene”, according to a spokesperson from her party.</p>
      <p>The incident has sparked anger on social media with some saying the response is sexist and an example of society dictating what women can wear.</p>
      <p>Supporters of Dorion set up a hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/moncotonouat%C3%A9monchoix">#moncotonouatémonchoix</a> (which translates to my hoodie, my choice) and are rallying other women to wear a hoodie to work on Tuesday and share photographs online.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/votre-lieu-de-travail/mon-coton-ouat%C3%A9-mon-choix/532931954166323/">Facebook g</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/votre-lieu-de-travail/mon-coton-ouat%C3%A9-mon-choix/532931954166323/">roup for the movement</a> says: “Women’s bodies do not belong to you. Women’s clothing choice does not belong to you,” and says what happened to Dorion is “close to intimidation”. </p>
      <p>“Cotton hoodie, bra, mini skirt, veil, overalls. It’s not your business. We do our job well and we will wear whatever we want," it adds.</p>
      <p>The National Assembly of Quebec has no official dress code, only guidance that MPs attending should be in attire that contributes to the “maintenance of decorum” in the building.</p>
      <p>Although it is customary that during parliamentary proceedings men wear a jacket and tie and women, a dress suit.</p>
      <p>There is an ongoing discussion about what appropriate attire looks like – in February <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jeans-and-sneakers-in-the-national-assembly-1.4933900">speaker </a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jeans-and-sneakers-in-the-national-assembly-1.4933900">François Paradis said</a> there should be a debate among members to decide on a set of rules. </p>
      <p>“Certainly, I do not think that it will be up to me, as president, to decide unilaterally. This is an issue which, following exchanges that we may have if necessary, will have to be decided collectively,” he told politicians, urging them to wear “business casual” until rules were in place.</p>
      <p>Dorion’s hoodie was not the first instance of controversial outfit choices from the Quebec Solidaire party, who have adopted more casual clothing including denim and Doc Marten boots, for which they have been criticised.</p>
      <p>Dorion defended her actions last week saying she wears casual clothes because she represents real people not the political class. </p>
      <p>The 37-year-old, who was elected in 2018, has been outspoken about her thoughts on the traditional attire of politicians: on Halloween <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/tele/tout-le-monde-en-parle/site/segments/entrevue/141348/catherine-dorion-halloween-habillement-assemblee-nationale">she posed for a photograph</a> in a skirt-suit saying she was “in costume” as an old-fashioned politician. </p>
      <p>In response the Liberal Party filed a letter of complaint with the ethics commissioner, saying her Halloween costume was disrespectful. Dorion said she was “shocked and disappointed” they would lecture her on what to wear.</p>
      <p>Former Speaker of the House John Bercow<a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=5795&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/29/mps-ties-house-of-commons-says-speaker-john-bercow"> told MPs in June 2017</a> they did not need to wear ties and then abandoned the speaker’s traditional outfit of a waistcoat, cuffs and collar opting for a suit under his robes.</p>
