      <p>Ubisoft has deployed a major new update for Ghost Recon Breakpoint which is available now across all platforms. Title Update 1.0.3 (1.04 on consoles) has a download size of roughly 7GB and includes a spread of fixes and improvements to the core game in response to player feedback.</p>

      <p>It’s fair to say that the open world tactical shooter was met with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/11/whats-so-bad-about-ghost-recon-breakpoint/">a rather <i>mixed</i> reception from critics</a> at launch. In our review <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/09/ghost-recon-breakpoint-review/">we scored the Wildlands sequel a disappointing 4/10</a> due to confused design choices and an embarrassing raft of technical problems that continued to hinder our enjoyment despite Breakpoint showing promise in the lead up to launch.</p>
      <p>This latest update is the first step outlined in Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/08/ghost-recon-breakpoint-november-roadmap-patch-1-03-survey/">roadmap</a>. The development team still plans to go ahead with its Project Titan raid and Terminator themed content drops. However, with Breakpoint having fallen far short of Ubisoft’s expectations, it is currently working on ways for players to tailor their own experience, such as tweaking the loot and survival systems with AI companions due to be introduced at some point.</p>
