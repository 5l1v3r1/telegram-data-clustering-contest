      <p>PARIS, Nov 12 — British indie rocker Pete Doherty is likely to plead guilty to charges of affray in a Paris court today, his lawyer said, as his band gears up for a European tour.</p>
      <p>The 40 year-old Libertines frontman will appear before the Paris public prosecutor this morning, said his lawyer Arash Derambarsh.</p>
      <p>He was arrested early on Sunday morning following an argument with members of the public, just hours after having been released following an earlier arrest for possession of cocaine.</p>
      <p>“We are likely to enter a guilty plea,” Derambarsh said, adding no-one was hurt as a result of the weekend altercation.</p>
      <p>Doherty shot to fame in the mid-2000s, when he dated supermodel Kate Moss, and has since been arrested numerous times for drug offences.</p>
      <p>Doherty was arrested in the Pigalle district of northern Paris in the night of Thursday to Friday for buying cocaine and provisionally fined €5,000 (RM22,850), the Paris prosecutor’s office and his lawyer have said.</p>
      <p>After being released he went out to celebrate, taking alcohol, sleeping pills and valium, Derambarsh said.</p>
      <p>Doherty, who has homes in Paris and Margate, got into an argument with two passers-by that led to his eventual re-arrest. “He lost control. He is ashamed of himself. He knows his behaviour is unacceptable,” added his lawyer.</p>
      <p>The Libertines, who played the Olympia venue in Paris on October 27, are due to embark on a European tour this month. — Reuters</p>
