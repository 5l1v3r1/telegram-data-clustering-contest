      <p>DARIEN, Conn. (AP) — Officials in Anguilla say they are preparing a warrant for the arrest of a Connecticut man who failed to appear for a pretrial hearing on a manslaughter charge.</p>
      <p>The office of the attorney general for the British Caribbean territory said Tuesday the warrant for Scott Hapgood of Darien, Connecticut, will be shared with Interpol.</p>
      <p>Hapgood is charged in the death of a hotel worker he says attacked his family during their April vacation.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said Hapgood decided against returning to the island for Monday’s hearing because he was worried about his safety and Anguilla (ang-GWIL’-uh) officials did not provide assurances he would be allowed to remain free on bond.</p>
      <p>Anguilla’s attorney general said in a news release the concerns about Hapgood’s safety and the fairness of proceedings are “totally groundless.”</p>
