      <h1>Clockenflap 2019 headliners The Kooks cancel appearance due to lead singer’s injury</h1>

      <p>British indie group The Kooks have been forced to cancel their Hong Kong appearance at Clockenflap later this month as their lead singer and guitarist continues to experience difficulties resulting from a spinal injury.</p>
      <p>In a video statement posted to social media today, singer Luke Pritchard confirmed that a recent MRI scan had revealed his spine hasn’t fully recovered from a back injury earlier this year, and that doctors advised him not to perform.</p>
      <p>He apologized to fans, and thanked them for their patience.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I’m completely gutted. I’ve been working very hard towards coming back on tour and I love Asia; I love being over there,” he said.</p>

      <p>The band were due to perform in a number of cities in China and Japan, as well as at <i>Coconuts HK</i> sister city Bangkok’s Very Festival.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time The Kooks have had to cancel a concert because of Pritchard’s spine injury. According to UK broadcaster ITV, the band had to <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/channel/2019-08-19/the-kooks-apologise-for-cancelling-appearance-at-electric-park/">pull out of a performance at the Electric Park Festival in Jersey</a> in August after Pritchard’s back seized up and he couldn’t walk or stand.</p>
      <p>He was found to have a perforated disc in his spine, which resulted in the band canceling a number of international appearances.</p>
      <p>The Kooks are the second act to pull out of this year’s Clockenflap, which organizers <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/lifestyle/no-need-to-cause-a-clockenflap-halsey-bombay-bicycle-club-and-nick-murphy-aint-scared-of-no-protests/">announced would go ahead at the end of October</a>, despite ongoing unrest in the city.</p>
      <p>The other act to pull out was indie pop singer-songwriter Cuco, who didn’t give a specific reason beyond saying in a social media message that he needed to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clockenflap/photos/a.140255628414/10157732577208415/?type=3&amp;theater">“take a step back and stay at home for a while.”</a></p>
