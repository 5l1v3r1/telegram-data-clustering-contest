      <h1>Instagram Is Coming for TikTok's Head By Copying Its Best Features</h1>

      <p>First, Instagram killed Snapchat when it cribbed its Stories feature. Now, the social media platform is reportedly <a href="https://gizmodo.com/instagram-is-coming-for-tiktoks-head-by-copying-its-bes-1839799498">gunning for TikTok with a new format called Reels</a>. From a report:<i> Reels is currently being rolled out in Brazil. Available on both iOS and Android, the feature lets users record 15-second clips that can then be set to music. Users can adjust speed, as well as borrow audio from other videos to remix and riff content. It also appears Instagram is adding video editing tools, like the ability to add timed captions and ghost overlays for transitions. Once a user is finished editing, the video can then be posted to their Stories -- and may also be shared to a new "Top Reels" section in the Explore tab. At the moment, there's no concrete timeline for when we might see Reels stateside. An Instagram spokesperson told Gizmodo that the company is simply excited to test the feature in Brazil for now, and "incorporate learnings and feed back from the community as [it] goes."</i></p>
