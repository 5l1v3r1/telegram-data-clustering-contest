      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/trainspottings-robert-carlyle-hopes-make-20862947"><i>Daily Record</i></a>, Carlyle spoke about the issues he faced in the aftermath of the film, with fans unable to understand differences between the actor himself and his character.</p>
      <p>“I maybe struggled against it a wee bit, kicked against it a wee bit at first,” he comments, “because you’re like, ‘Ah, that’s not all I am'”.</p>

      <p>He does go on to show his thanks for the role, saying: “But thank God for it – it’s led to so many different things for me and people love it. It’s like, you’re in people’s psyche.</p>
      <p>“I’m blessed to have been part of it. It seems like there’s not a week goes by that somebody doesn’t go, ‘Hey, Begbie’.”</p>
      <p>In other Trainspotting news, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/trainspotting-3-irvine-welsh-third-sequel-2552735">author Irvine Welsh revealed last month that he’d be “massively interested” in completing the “holy trinity” with a third <i>Trainspotting</i> film</a>.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the prospect of <i>Trainspotting 3</i>, Carlyle jokes about the two decade wait for the sequel, saying: “It’d have to be set in a rest home, probably. Skagboys Rest Home. It might take that long but Danny might do it.”</p>
