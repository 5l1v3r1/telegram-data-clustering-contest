      <p>Writing can be a lonely pastime, but it doesn't have to be. I live in a rural area with a relatively vibrant literary community, but being out in the boonies, while peaceful, means that I often find myself unable to make it to meetings with like-minded writers. That goes double for NaNoWriMo months, in which my desire to write a minimum of 1,667 words per day means traveling up to an hour or more, round trip, to hang out with some fellow creatives, is completely off the table. That's why I adore <a href="https://thewritelife.com/writing-podcasts/">podcasts by writers</a>, because you can still feel as if you're part of a community of creatives, even when you're miles away.</p>
      <p>Audio series like the ones on the list below make me feel like I'm in the room with my favorite authors, which is not only inspirational, but can also spark new thought patterns. Some of the podcasts on this list will also push you out of your comfort zone, and help guide you through some of the trickier parts of the creative writing process, from navigating your online profile to post-publishing movie deals. Check out the episodes on this list first, then share your favorite writing podcasts with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</p>
