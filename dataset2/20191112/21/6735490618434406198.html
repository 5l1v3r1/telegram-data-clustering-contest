      <p>It’s official: John Legend is <i>People</i> magazine’s <a href="https://people.com/music/john-legend-sexiest-man-alive-2019-reveal/">Sexiest Man Alive</a> for 2019.</p>
      <p><i>People</i>, which has been celebrating male sexiness for more than 30 years, made the announcement with the help of Blake Shelton during Tuesday’s live episode of “The Voice”.</p>
      <p>“It is my duty to formally introduce the next Sexiest Man Alive,” said Shelton, who was 2017’s Sexiest Man Alive. “And he just so happens to be here tonight! Ladies and gentlemen, the man, the myth, the Legend!”</p>

      <p>Shelton jokingly presented his fellow coach with a pair of jeans that had been gaudily bedazzled with the new acronym Shelton was bestowing upon him.</p>
      <p>“You already had an EGOT,” he began, “then you won ‘The Voice’, so it became a VEGOT. Now, you have the VEGOTSMA!”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what to say!” Legend told the audience. “I want to thank <i>People </i>magazine, of course, but mostly, I want to thank Blake Shelton, because I sat next to him for the last few months, and I learned his sexy ways. I observed every move he made, every utterance that came from his mouth, and I think some of it rubbed off on me. I think that has everything to do with why we’re here today.”</p>

      <p>Legend’s wife, Chrissy Teigen, celebrated the big news with an enthusiastic tweet.</p>

      <p>There’s definitely a connection going on between sexiness and “The Voice”; in addition to Legend and Shelton, former “Voice” coach Adam Levine was 2013’s Sexiest Man Alive.</p>

      <p>Legend succeeds last year’s honouree, Idris Elba.</p>
      <p>“I was excited, but I was a little scared at the same time because it’s a lot of pressure,” Legend told <a href="https://people.com/music/john-legend-sexiest-man-alive-2019-reveal/"><i>People</i></a>. “Everyone’s going to be picking me apart to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title. I’m [also] following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!”</p>
