        <b>Dominion Energy’s VC Summer Nuclear Station in Fairfield County, South Carolina, was shut down last Wednesday after what plant officials described as a “small leak” was found in the reactor coolant system several weeks ago.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Dominion Energy spokesperson Ken Holt, the leak is being monitored by operators and has been confined to the containment building so as not to impact the surrounding environment.</p>
      <blockquote>“There is no danger to the public,” Holt said, the <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/coolant-leak-shuts-down-south-carolina-s-vc-summer-nuclear/article_2240552c-0490-11ea-a96b-b36bad280ba5.html">Post and Courier reported</a>. “Although the small leak is not at a level that would require a plant shutdown, operators made the conservative decision to shut down the reactor to address the leak.” </blockquote>
      <p>Operators are actively working to “find and address any other impacted components,” Holt noted.</p>
      <p>However, Holt did not provide any details on when the plant will be back in service, because that is “considered market-sensitive information.”</p>
      <p>Nuclear <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201607021042336393-russian-floating-nuclear-plant/">safety</a> watchdog Tom Clements expressed concern to <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/environment/article237204218.html">The State</a> that the Virginia-based power utility did not inform the public about the leak in an official statement; instead, Dominion Energy only confirmed the leak to the outlet after being questioned about it.</p>
      <blockquote>“They should have notified the public. With nuclear plants, it is essential that there be full openness about safety related issues,” Clements said.</blockquote>
      <p>However, Holt said that the company informed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the leak and is not required to make any other public statements.</p>
      <p>The VC Summer Nuclear <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201511011029418981-belgium-nuclear-plant-explosion/">Station</a> began operating in 1982. A project to add two new nuclear reactors to the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/news/201603081035928879-US-nuclear-power-station-shut-down-explosion-fire/">plant</a> was dropped in July 2017 due to cost and management issues.</p>
