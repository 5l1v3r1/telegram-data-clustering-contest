      <h1>Two Former Circle Executives Co-Found Proprietary Crypto Trading Firm</h1>

      <p>Two former executives at crypto finance firm Circle and former DRW executive jointly founded proprietary crypto trading firm CMS Holdings.</p>
      <h3>The new venture</h3>
      <p>Coindesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/former-cumberland-and-circle-traders-pool-money-for-crypto-prop-trading">reported</a> on Nov. 12 that the firm is the joint venture of former Circle executives Daniel Matuszewski — former head of the firm’s over-the-counter desk Circle Trade — and former technology executive Julien Collard-Seguin alongside a third partner. The third founder is the former head of trading at Cumberland (the crypto trading arm of brokerage DRW) Bobby Cho.</p>
      <p>According to the outlet, the three decided to pool over $10 million. The firm started trading last month. CMS Holdings is based out of the Cayman Islands and does not manage the money of outside investors. Cho explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“We deploy strategies much like a hedge fund in the market, except that we’re not structured as such.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Crypto is “a lot safer now”</h3>
      <p>CMS Holdings plans to invest 30% of its capital into the most liquid cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and 40% to 50% into less-traded digital assets, with remaining funds going into long-term equity in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
      <p>Matuszewski, who <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-otc-trading-branch-head-daniel-matuszewski-resigns">left</a> Circle in August, admitted that he would not have started such a firm just a few years ago because of risk concerns. He reportedly explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“There was always a non-zero chance that bitcoin would gap down, die, and never come back. [...] It’s a lot safer now, in that it’s probably not going to disappear.”</blockquote>
      <p>His statements resonate with increasing participation of regulated actors in the cryptocurrency space. In one recent example, Switzerland-based cryptocurrency bank SEBA <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulated-swiss-crypto-bank-seba-opens-doors">launched</a> its services for professional investors and enterprise clients.</p>
