      <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Gov. Tony Evers stated why he decided to call the Capitol tree the "Holiday Tree" instead of the "Christmas Tree" as previously declared by former governor Scott Walker.</p>
      <p>Last week, Evers went back to <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/evers-goes-back-to-calling-capitol-evergreen-holiday-tree">calling the Capitol evergreen a "Holiday Tree."</a> This comes eight years after former Republican Governor Scott Walker declared the tree a "Christmas Tree."</p>
      <p>"It's a holiday season for a whole bunch of people in the state of Wisconsin, even those that aren't part of the Christian faith. I think it's a more inclusive thing," said Evers. "I know a lot of people love to have that debate, and I think it's a good debate to have."</p>

      <p>The fight over what to call the tree has been going on for years and even after Evers' announcement, the fight still lives on. On Tuesday, in a 64-30 vote, the bipartisan Wisconsin Assembly voted to call the state Capitol evergreen a "Christmas tree."</p>
      <p>"People say, 'Evers made a mistake by doing that,' but I think it's a good conversation to have and at the end of the day, 'Holiday Tree' is a good use," said Evers.</p>
      <p>Evers was asked if his family called the tree in their home a "Christmas Tree" growing up, and Evers acknowledged that this was true but reiterated that the tree was in their home, not on the grounds of City Hall in Plymouth, Wisconsin.</p>
