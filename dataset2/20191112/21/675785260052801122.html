      <p>Bridget Jones Diary author Helen Fielding says the team of Jim’ll Fix It had a rule on set: “Don’t leave Jimmy alone with the children”.</p>
      <p>The writer, who worked for the BBC show in her early 20s, says producers “must have known” to have suspicions about his behaviour.</p>
      <p>Helen said her role behind the scenes after graduating from Oxford University, was during a conversation with Alain de Botton, was asked whether she had her suspicions about his behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Well, we always said: ‘Don’t leave Jimmy alone with the children,’” she told the audience. “But we were sort of 23, and you know.... I am sure the producers must have known.</p>

      <p>“We didn’t think he would do anything. But he was so creepy. We always stayed with the kids.”</p>
      <p>Joking about her stint on the show after leaving Uni, she said at the School of Life event at London’s Emmanuel Centre: “I always had aspirations to be quite literary and intellectual - but I worked for Jim’ll Fix It, and things like that.”</p>
      <p>The author, 61, admitted she now feels uncomfortable watching the first Bridget Jones Diary films in light of the #MeToo movement.</p>

      <p>“Post #MeToo, I just couldn’t believe the amount of casual sexism in literally every single scene,” she said. “The hand on the bum, you know Mr Tits Pervert.</p>
      <p>“The terrible thing was I just didn’t think about it. I was just writing stuff and that is what happened all the time. You know Daniel [Cleaver - one of Bridget’s suitors] would say ‘Mr Tits Pervert is disgusting. P.S I like your tits in that top.’”</p>
      <p>Helen also fuelled speculation she based her Mark Darcy character on Labour’s Keir Starmer, admitting she declines to answer when asked specifically about it.</p>
      <p>Helen will present a BBC documentary to mark 25 years since she created Bridget next year. She will explore the cultural impact of the franchise, which started in 1995.</p>
