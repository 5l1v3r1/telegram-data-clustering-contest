      <h2>Photographer Joanna Rose sold her camera with £15 postage but was asked to send it to a different address than the one she had initially received - which turned out to be a scam</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:22:41+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author">Olivia Williams, Chiara Fiorillo</a></address>
      <p>A woman has claimed she was scammed after she sold her camera on eBay for £1,300 due to a PayPal "loophole".</p>
      <p>Photographer Joanna Rose, who lives in Halewood, Liverpool, sold her expensive camera with £15 postage.</p>
      <p>She said a person bought it in the morning of October 23, but then messaged asking for the address to be changed.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old said the "scam buyer" claimed he had bought the camera as a "gift for his daughter" but had forgotten to change the address on his account.</p>
      <p>Even though Joanna received proof that the buyer had received the item and signed for it, the fraudster then opened up a case on PayPal claiming he had not received the camera.</p>
      <p>Joanna told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/paypal-loophole-leaves-woman-1300-17241072">Liverpool Echo</a> : "The person bought the item at around 2am in the morning and then 5am he messaged to say he bought it for his daughter but had not changed the address on his account.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"He asked me to send this to a new address and I thought nothing of it because I have done it before and it was fine.</p>
      <p>"I posted it special delivery, with next day delivery and with proof of a signature. But about a week later he opened a case against me on Paypal saying he had not received the item."</p>
      <p>She added the buyer did not go through eBay, but went straight to PayPal to file the complaint.</p>
      <p>In its terms and conditions, PayPal says to "ship the item to the shipping address listed on the PayPal Transaction Details page."</p>

      <p>Since the buyer changed the address, Joanna says PayPal ruled in his favour.</p>
      <p>The photographer then lost the money she had received, as it was refunded to the scammer, who also kept the item.</p>
      <p>Joanna said: "PayPal is effectively playing into the hands of fraudsters.</p>

      <p>"I tried to appeal the case but PayPal said there is nothing they can do."</p>
      <p>The business entrepreneur said two people from PayPal told her they were "aware of the loophole".</p>
      <p>She said: "When I spoke to PayPal they just said they have to stick to the terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>"It is upsetting. I just want to make it known that it's a scam because it's such a lot of money and I don't think people know that this is PayPal's policy."</p>

      <p>Joanna said she has contacted ActionFraud police and they are investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson told the Liverpool Echo: “We have looked into Ms Hufton’s case and unfortunately it appears she has fallen victim to a scam.</p>
      <p>"The buyer’s account appears to have been compromised and then used to buy Ms Hufton’s camera.</p>

      <p>"Sellers need to be very wary if a seller asks them to change the delivery address.</p>
      <p>"They must post the item to the shipping address on the 'Transaction Details' page. If a buyer asks you to send it to another address then you will not be eligible for re-imbursement under PayPal’s seller protection programme.”</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has approached PayPal for comment.</p>
