      <p>The Argentine sub <i>San Juan</i> vanished in 2017 and its wreckage was found only months later, but from the search mission's outset rescuers suspected what had happened. The sound of an implosion—"a singular, anomalous, violent, non-nuclear event"—was picked up hours after the vessel's last transmission. If you are horrified by the idea of a huge metal can being suddenly crushed by water pressure, this computer simulation of the <i>San Juan's</i> demise may well rationalize and deepen your conviction never to set foot on a sub.</p>
