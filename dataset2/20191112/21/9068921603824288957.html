      <h1>AirPods Pro Available From Amazon for $235</h1>

      <p>Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> are normally priced at $249, but for those looking for a deal, Amazon has them <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=macrumors-20">at the discounted price of $235</a>. <br/><br/>That's a savings of $14, which isn't much, but it's better than full price. This deal could go quickly, and the last time it was available, Amazon only discounted the ‌AirPods Pro‌ for a few hours.</p>

      <p>Amazon says that the ‌AirPods Pro‌ have an extended delivery time due to shipping restrictions, with orders expected to arrive sometime next week. <br/><br/>We're not expecting to see prices much lower than this on the upcoming Black Friday shopping holiday due to the fact that the ‌AirPods Pro‌ are newly released. <br/><br/><i>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.
