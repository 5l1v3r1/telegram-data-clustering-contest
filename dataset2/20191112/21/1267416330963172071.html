      <h1>Disney+ aspect ratio hides some of ‘The Simpsons’ visual gags</h1>
      <h2>Disney+ features the first 30 seasons of the iconic sitcom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:30:37+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/bradly-shankar" target="_blank">Bradly Shankar</a></address>
      <p>One of the main selling points of <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/welcome?irclickid=VOF3zC0goxyOUHC0TbWK8Xs3Ukn1xaRVrXzgRs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact--MobileSyrup-564546">Disney+ at launch was the service’s</a> ability to stream the first 30 seasons of <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p>
      <p>However, with <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-canada-now-available-everything-you-need-to-know/">Disney+ now available in Canada</a>, the U.S., and the Netherlands, users have quickly discovered that streaming <i>The Simpsons </i>is less-than-ideal.</p>
      <p>That’s because Disney+ displays episodes of <i>The Simpsons </i>in an aspect ratio that actually cuts away from some of the show’s signature visual gags.</p>
      <p>When they were originally broadcast, the older episodes of the sitcom were displayed in 4:3 format that fit TVs in the pre-HD era. <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/welcome?irclickid=VOF3zC0goxyOUHC0TbWK8Xs3Ukn1xaRVrXzgRs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact--MobileSyrup-564546">Now, though, Disney+ is showing episodes in widescreen 16:9</a>, resulting in a cropped picture that leaves out some imagery.</p>
      <p>For example, one of the series’ episodes features a joke about the Duff brewery selling three types of beer that are all just the same alcohol. With a 4:3 aspect ratio, the viewer can see one large Duff tube funnelling the beer into three distinctly-labelled pipes. In 16:9, the big tube is cut off, so the gag would be missed entirely.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is just one example that was pointed out on social media, but there are surely many more that could be mentioned, given the series’ decades-long history.</p>
      <p>When asked if a 4:3 ratio option will be added in the future, Disney declined to comment, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961067/simpsons-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-43-169-streaming-fxx">according to <i>The Verge</i></a>.</p>
      <p>It’s currently unclear if this aspect ratio issue affects any other shows or movies on Disney+.</p>
