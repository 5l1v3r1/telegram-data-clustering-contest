      <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rose to record highs on Tuesday as trade-sensitive technology stocks gained ahead of a much-awaited speech by President Donald Trump, which was likely to provide some clarity on the U.S.-China tariff talks.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rose to record highs on Tuesday as trade-sensitive technology stocks gained ahead of a much-awaited speech by President Donald Trump, which was likely to provide some clarity on the U.S.-China tariff talks.</p>
      <p>Hopes of a resolution to the 16-month long tariff dispute and a strong corporate earnings season have powered Wall Street's gains so far this month.</p>

      <p>All 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were trading higher, with the technology sector's 0.53per cent rise providing the biggest boost, followed by healthcare shares .</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 0.84per cent.</p>
      <p>Trump is scheduled to discuss the country's trade policy at the Economic Club of New York later on Tuesday and markets are likely to hang on to every word.</p>
      <p>"There is some optimism that Trump will tell people something they like to hear, whether it's the civics or a general delay in tariffs," said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>"The focus is very much on those expectations on 'if not good news then at least the avoidance of bad news' from Trump."</p>
      <p>About three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far have topped analysts' profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>A fresh set of economic data is also expected later this week. Retail sales in October is expected to rebound from a surprise contraction in the previous month and industrial production is likely to decline by the same measure as last month.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give his comments on the domestic economic outlook this week.</p>
