      <p>Orders and deliveries of new Boeing planes remain depressed eight months into the grounding of the company’s 737 Max.</p>
      <p>Boeing said on Tuesday that an aircraft-leasing company replaced an order for 15 Max jets with an order of five 787s, a larger plane used mostly on international routes.</p>
      <p>Another customer dropped an order for three Max planes after ordering a larger Boeing 777 earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Chicago-based Boeing said it took 10 new orders in October, down from 24 in the same month last year, which included 14 Max jets.</p>
      <p>The company delivered 20 commercial planes last month, including 12 for the 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner. That is down from 57 a year earlier, a decline that hurts Boeing’s cash flow because customers pay much of the purchase price on delivery.</p>
      <p>Boeing burned through $2.9bn in cash in the third quarter, compared with generating $4.1bn in free cash flow a year earlier, and it took on $5.5bn in new debt.</p>
      <p>European rival Airbus said it took 415 orders in October, with 300 coming in one deal with IndiGo.</p>
      <p>The Indian discount carrier ordered planes in the Airbus A320neo family, planes that compete with the Max.</p>
      <p>Airbus said it delivered 77 airliners last month, including 56 in the neo category.</p>
      <p>The Max has been grounded since March after two accidents killed 346 people.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Boeing said it hopes to resume deliveries of the Max in December and win Federal Aviation Administration approval of changes to the plane and a pilot-training course in January, clearing the way for the plane to return to service in the United States.</p>
      <p>Regulators in other countries are expected to take longer.</p>
