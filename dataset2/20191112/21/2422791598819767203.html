      <p>Spending time outdoors is long understood to offer mental health perks, including reduced stress, improved sleep and enhanced cognition.</p>
      <p>But these public spaces might also benefit the global economy, new research suggests.</p>
      <p>Visits to national parks around the world may result in improved mental health valued at about $US6 trillion, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12631-6">according to a team of ecologists, psychologists and economists from Griffith University in Australia.</a></p>
      <p>"People already visit parks to recover from stress," said lead author Ralf Buckley in a press release. "In healthcare terms, it's patient-funded therapy."</p>
      <p>But the value of such preventative therapy had never been quantified on a global scale, he noted. </p>
      <p>Through three pilot studies involving almost 20,000 people -- based on a representative sample of the Australians and interviews at Lamington and Springbrook national parks -- the researchers measured the impact of park visits on quality of life. </p>
      <p>Using well established economic models, they estimated how those benefits would translate into healthcare savings in Australia, and then globally.</p>
      <p>They determined that without outdoor parks, the costs of poor mental health could cost Australia alone an additional $145 billion annually.</p>
      <p>The research was published Tuesday in <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">Nature Communications.</a></p>
