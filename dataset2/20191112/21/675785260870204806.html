      <h1>Gareth Southgate reminds England players who's boss with response to Raheem Sterling row</h1>
      <h2>Southgate gave a timely reminder to his players who was in charge with his firm response to Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez's bust-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:00:57+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate laid down the law to his players after reminding them exactly who is in charge.</p>
      <p>Southgate made a huge ­statement by dropping Raheem Sterling as punishment for his row with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>But Southgate admitted it was his decision rather than the ­players’, as it even emerged Gomez had urged him not to take any ­action against Sterling.</p>
      <p>The England boss has always taken pride in the togetherness of his Three Lions squad, which has been an ­integral part of why ­results have improved during Southgate’s two-year reign.</p>
      <p>But this has been a major test of his man-management and it felt, by speaking out, Southgate was attempting to reassert his ­authority and set standards to stop any potential cliques.</p>

      <p>He said: “I am the manager and I have certain decisions which are my responsibility, and that I am ­prepared to take.</p>
      <p>“The decision has been made not to ­consider Raheem for the game on Thursday. That is the end of the matter for me. We then have to move forward and that is why it was important for me to get the group ­together. That was the most important thing.</p>
      <p>“I am dealing with a very young squad and we are in a sport where ­emotions often run high.</p>
      <p>“Raheem explained that, for a very brief ­moment, his emotions ran over, and it would be correct to say that was not the same for Joe.</p>
      <p>“And these things ­happen in football. Then what you have to find is a way for the group to move ­forward and that needed some time, needed emotions across the board to calm down.”</p>

      <p>It has arguably been the ­toughest 48 hours of Southgate’s reign in dealing with the fall-out between Sterling, his best player, and Gomez, who he has nurtured from Under-21 level.</p>
      <p>Southgate did look nervous, edgy and uncomfortable as he spoke about the row, and it felt awkward because he did seem ­inconsistent on two counts.</p>
      <p>He insisted on Monday night the whole squad was behind the decision to drop Sterling, but then said it came after consulting the players’ leadership group, which includes Harry Kane, Jordan ­Henderson, Harry Maguire, Fabian Delph and Sterling himself.</p>
      <p>And Southgate ­excused James Maddison from any punishment after he was pictured in a casino, despite the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> star being sent home ill from the last camp.</p>

      <p>When asked whether all the players were on board, and if it was fair after what happened to Maddison, Southgate said: “It’s not for me to discuss the ­details of the incident, so there’s nothing to be gained from any ­further discussion on that.</p>
      <p>“In the end, I always have to find the right solution for the group and for how we will work moving forward. That’s a very difficult line.</p>
      <p>“You try to be fair at all times, with all the players. I won’t always get that right but, in the end, I’m the manager.</p>
      <p>“I’ve made a decision and it was appropriate for how we want to work moving forward. Raheem is a very important player for us, but I felt it was the right thing.”</p>
      <p>It was Henderson who helped play peacemaker on Monday and called Sterling back after the City forward left St George’s Park ­following the row.</p>
      <p>Southgate praised some of his senior players and insisted he would have taken the same action no matter the opposition or ­player’s status.</p>
      <p>Bitter feuds between Liverpool and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> was a negative feature during the Golden Generation years – and that is something Southgate is ­desperate to avoid now.</p>
      <p>He added: “I ­consult very closely with all the players, in ­particular the ­senior players. They have a very good understanding of the way we’ve worked over the years.</p>
      <p>“It’s brought us a lot of togetherness, which is still there. Now we have to turn our focus to the football.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a hugely important qualifier and that’s why I’m speaking now. We draw a line under it and move forward as a team.”</p>
