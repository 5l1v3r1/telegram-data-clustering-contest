      <h1>On Disney+’s Version of <i>Star Wars</i>, Greedo Says ‘Ma Klounkee!’ First</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:25:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jackson McHenry</a></address>
      <p>Anyone who can navigate through the mire of technical glitches that have plagued <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/disney-plus-streaming-strategy.html">the launch of Disney+</a> has a whole lot of <i>Star Wars</i> surprises waiting for them. Not just the first episode of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-mandalorian-star-wars-disney-plus-review.html"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> but apparently a new version of <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, in which Greedo and Han Solo’s infamous shootout in the Mos Eisley cantina has been changed yet again.</p>
      <p>In the original version of the movie, and the one fans generally prefer, Han shoots the bounty hunter Greedo at point-blank range after a few threats but not a ton of other provocation. (Is he justified? That’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/han-solo-legally-justified-shooting-greedo-first.html">a subject for the legal experts</a>.) In 1997, Lucas changed the scene so that Greedo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpXD2tvV-9Q">shoots first</a>, and he changed it again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv3t0Be3aHc">in 2004</a>, so that they shoot at each other almost simultaneously, with Greedo firing a little before. The version currently available for streaming, as a Vulture staffer checked and confirmed, still has Greedo and Han shooting each other at nearly the same time but not until after Greedo shouts a phrase that sounds like “Maclunkey!”</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/disney-plus-movies-shows-include-deals-cost.html">Disney+</a> subscribers on Twitter have already noticed the new, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericfell/status/1194180485129199619">Maclunkey-added version of the original film</a> and reacted with the appropriate levels of intense confusion. According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>, Lucas himself made the change to <i>A New Hope </i>before selling the <i>Star Wars </i>films to Disney in 2012, though that still doesn’t explain Greedo’s weird exclamation. What does “Maclunkey” mean? Why does it sound like the last name of a football star from a Wisconsin high school? Was Maclunkey Rey’s mom or dad? Millions of voices suddenly cried out “Maclunkey!” in unison, and so far have gotten no reply.</p>

      <p><b>Update: </b>We have something of an answer to this great, clunky mystery. As writer Donna Dickens <a href="https://twitter.com/MExasperated/status/1194340506064609280">pointed out on Twitter</a>, what Greedo is saying is likely the Huttese phrase “ma klounkee,” which pops up a few times elsewhere in the <i>Star Wars </i>universe and means something along the lines of “this will be the end of you.” Having Greedo say it is probably a way to make him all the more threatening and make Han seem all the less murderous. That, or George Lucas really wanted to troll a bunch of entertainment writers into brushing up on their fake <i>Star Wars</i> languages.</p>
