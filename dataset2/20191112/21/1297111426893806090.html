      <p>In just a few weeks, Saskatchewan will become the second province in Canada to provide free access to Respect Group Inc.’s Respect in School training for all of the province’s school divisions, First Nation education authorities and independent schools.</p>
      <p>Available over the next two years, the 90-minute online training includes content on preventing, identifying, responding to and reporting incidents of bullying, abuse, harassment and discrimination in schools.</p>
      <p>“I think being able to reach kids early and give them that safe and supporting space to learn and become who they want to become is absolutely critical,” said <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/sheldon-kennedy-receives-an-honorary-u-of-r-degree-for-advocacy-work">Sheldon Kennedy, former NHLer and Swift Current Bronco and co-founder of Respect Group Inc.</a></p>

      <p>The training is an extension of the Respect In Sport program, which was designed in the wake of the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/sheldon-kennedy-accepts-apology-from-city-where-he-was-abused-in-junior-hockey">sexual abuse Kennedy endured from</a><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/sheldon-kennedy-accepts-apology-from-city-where-he-was-abused-in-junior-hockey"> then Broncos head coach Graham James</a><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/sheldon-kennedy-accepts-apology-from-city-where-he-was-abused-in-junior-hockey"> during the five years Kennedy played for the Broncos, </a></p>
      <p>Kennedy said it’s important to empower the bystander, the 99 per cent of people who aren’t engaged in abuse but have the potential to detect it and intervene. What often stops people from doing that is an uncertainty of what to do, he added.</p>
      <p>“A lot of kids, young people, look at our teachers, our school bus drivers, maybe the custodians, as their only trusted adult in their life, so we need to make sure that they have the tools to know what to do and be able to respond appropriately,” said Kennedy at a joint announcement Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Detecting red flags is part of it, he added.</p>
      <p>Children who have been abused are 26 times more likely to experience youth homelessness and have a 30-per-cent higher dropout rate in high school, according to Kennedy. </p>
      <p>“The more people that understand and recognize the signs of things that are happening — whether it’s abuse, other things happening in the schools — think it’s pretty important,” said Minister of Education Gordon Wyant.</p>
      <p>The ministry has partnered with Respect Group to roll out the school-focused program provincewide and is footing the bill, $100,000 a year for two years. The training will be available to the province’s more than 13,500 teachers, thousands of educational assistants, and thousands of bus drivers and parent volunteers who wish to take part. But it is not mandatory, said Shawn Davidson, president of the Saskatchewan School Boards Association.</p>
      <p>When asked why a program promoted as critically important by the provincial government, his own association and Respect Group isn’t mandatory, Davidson paused before replying.</p>
      <p>“When you start making things mandatory, sometimes that has an opposite effect and you don’t have as much buy-in,” he said. “I think that the actual buy-in will possibly be greater than if something was being rammed down their throat.”</p>

      <p>He anticipates divisions and staff will be “quite interested” in the program and in bettering themselves.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes after talks between the government and Respect Group over a number of years that explored ways to bring the program to Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>According to Kennedy, some Saskatchewan school divisions were already doing it, but the ministry funding allows all divisions to take part regardless of where they are in the province and any cost constraints they may face.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s very important that it’s available online to make sure that we can reach as many leaders in our school communities as possible,” said Wyant.</p>
      <p>Manitoba introduced the free provincewide training about five years ago after a successful pilot project, according to Kennedy.</p>
      <p>The provincial government expects the training to be available in Saskatchewan within “a few weeks.”</p>
      <p>“We need to create a confidence around these issues that carry a lot of fear,” said Kennedy. “When we can create a confidence we can create an ability to have a conversation, we can create the ability not to be scared to step in and ask questions and have that conversation with that individual that might need our help.”</p>
