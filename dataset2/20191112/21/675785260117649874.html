      <h1>ITV is set to re-launch The Darling Buds of May for first time in 30 years</h1>
      <h2>The original series ended in 1993 having lasted three series, but now ITV is bringing the hit comedy-drama three decades down the line</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:28:57+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:28</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>The Darling Buds of May - the comedy-drama about a family in Kent during the 1950s - is set to make a comeback.</p>
      <p>ITV will revive the hit show 30 years after producers packed it in in 1993.</p>
      <p>It had run for three series, and become one of the most popular shows on British telly.</p>
      <p>Now that The Durrells has come to a close, ITV needs something to fill the hole it's left - and Darling Buds will fit in nicely.</p>
      <p>The show starred Only Fools and Horses comedy legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-jason">Sir David Jason</a> , as well as launching the career of now-Hollywood titan <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/catherine-zeta-jones">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> .</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10333127/darling-buds-of-may-return/">The Sun</a> : "A revamped version of The Darling Buds of May is just the kind of show ITV needs to keep its reputation for making family-friendly dramas.</p>
      <p>"It brought people together around the TV almost three decades ago, and they're hoping it will provide the same shared experience once again."</p>
      <p>Pop Larkin, Sir David's lead character, was renowned for his outlandish money-making schemes, while Catherine occupied the role of his eldest daughter Mariette.</p>

      <p>It's currently unknown if any of the original cast will make a comeback, but talks are reportedly happening with sought-after talent.</p>
      <p>Both David and Catherine have had prestigious careers since the show ended - if very different ones.</p>
      <p>Catherine made waves across the pond in several high-profile Hollywood flicks, including the Zorro franchise, Chicago and Ocean's Twelve.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She also went on to marry American actor Michael Douglas.</p>
      <p>David, meanwhile, kept up his work on both Only Fools and the hard-hitting detective drama A Touch of Frost.</p>
      <p>He's also no stranger to reboots, having starred in a rejuvenated version of his comedy Open All Hours, Still Open All Hours.</p>
