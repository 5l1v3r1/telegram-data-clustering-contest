      <p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rose to record highs on Tuesday as trade-sensitive technology stocks gained ahead of a much-awaited speech by President Donald Trump, which was likely to provide some clarity on the U.S.-China tariff talks.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes remained at record levels on Tuesday spurred by gains in trade-sensitive technology stocks, after President Donald Trump reiterated that the United States was close to signing a "phase one" trade deal with China.</p>
      <p>Hopes of a resolution to the 16-month long tariff dispute and a strong corporate earnings season have powered Wall Street's gains so far this month.</p>

      <p>During his speech at the Economic club of New York, Trump said a trade deal could happen soon, but said that Washington would only accept a deal if it was good for the United States and its workers.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were trading higher, with the technology sector and healthcare shares providing the biggest boost to the benchmark index.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor index also rose 0.82per cent.</p>
      <p>"He was beating on China little bit, but not too much. He kind of left the door open, if you will, to actually getting a deal," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.</p>
      <p>"The concern was that he might say something negative on China that would have an impact, but don't think he has been that hard on them."</p>
      <p>About three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far have topped analysts' profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Earnings from big firms including Walmart Inc , Nvidia Corp and Cisco Systems Inc as well as a fresh set of economic data are due this week.</p>
      <p>On the data front, retail sales in October is expected to rebound from a surprise contraction in the previous month, while industrial production is likely to decline by the same measure as the prior month.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will also give his comments on the domestic economic outlook this week.</p>
      <p>At 1:17 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36.82 points, or 0.13per cent, at 27,728.31, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 10.32 points, or 0.33per cent, at 3,097.33. The Nasdaq Composite was up 39.94 points, or 0.47per cent, at 8,504.22.</p>
      <p>Among stocks, Walt Disney Co rose 1.4per cent as the company said demand for its much-anticipated streaming service, Disney+, was well above its expectations in a launch marred by complaints from users about glitches and connection problems.</p>
      <p>Shares of Netflix Inc were down 0.7per cent.</p>
      <p>Rockwell Automation Inc jumped 12per cent as the factory automation equipment maker beat fourth-quarter profit expectations and forecast 2020 earnings above estimates.</p>
      <p>CBS Corp dropped 3.1per cent after the media company missed quarterly revenue estimates. Shares of Viacom Inc , which is merging with CBS, were also down 3per cent.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.22-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 40 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and 75 new lows.</p>
