        <b>The Liberal Democrat candidate in Canterbury has stood down because he feared dividing the Remain vote.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tim Walker said he was concerned standing would allow the Conservative candidate to take the seat from Labour.</p>
      <p>Mr Walker said the Lib Dems had tried to do a deal with Labour over the seat, and when that failed he made the decision himself to stand down.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems told the BBC they will be selecting a new candidate to contest the Kent constituency.</p>
      <p>Labour's Rosie Duffield took the seat from the Tories at the 2017 general election with a majority of only 187 votes.</p>
      <p>The constituency voted 51% to leave the EU in the Brexit referendum in 2016.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/liberal-democrat-candidate-labour-brexit">Writing in the Guardian,</a> Mr Walker said: "Politics does not always have to be grubby and small-minded; sometimes it's possible to acknowledge that what's at stake is more important than party politics - and personal ambition - and we can do what's right.</p>
      <p>"In this invidious situation, both standing and not standing could be interpreted as weakness.</p>
      <p>"But the nightmare that kept me awake was posing awkwardly at the count beside a vanquished Duffield as the Tory Brexiter raised her hands in triumph. I wanted no part in that."</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier on Tuesday evening, before the news emerged, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson was asked about whether her party could still do an electoral deal with Labour,</p>
      <p>She told the BBC Labour had failed to engage in previous talks with Remain-supporting parties and said Labour "aren't really qualified to be a part of a Remain alliance".</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50327937">the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party announced</a> an electoral pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in 60 seats in England and Wales.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage announced his candidates would not be standing in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>The candidates standing in the Canterbury constituency announced so far are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rosie Duffield (Labour)</li>
        <li>Anna Firth (Conservatives)</li>
        <li>Owen Prew (Brexit Party)</li>
        <li>Henry Stanton (Green Party)</li>
