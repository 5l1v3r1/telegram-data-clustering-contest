      <h2>Neither are in Zidane's plans but both could strengthen Machin's options</h2>

      <p>Names will continue to come up in the coming weeks as Espanyol owner Mr. Chen looks to invest in the team in January to strengthen Pablo Machin's hand.</p>
      <p>Two of the first two to crop up are the Real Madrid duo Brahim Diaz and Mariano, who have both been offered to Espanyol ahead of the winter transfer window.</p>
      <p>Neither Brahim nor Mariano are getting the minutes they want at Madrid and neither feature in coach Zinedine Zidane's plans. The Frenchman has a number of other options in attack.</p>
      <p>The relationship between Madrid and Espanyol is good, given they have previously done deals on players such as Callejon, Lucas Vazquez, Kiko Casilla and Marco Asensio.</p>
      <p>Espanyol like the idea but would need Madrid to play their part. Both players have large wages which the club would not be able to pay in full.</p>
      <p>Machin's side sit in the bottom three after 13 games but have shown signs of improvement since the former Girona manager was appointed last month.</p>
