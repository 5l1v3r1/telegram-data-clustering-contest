      <p>DHAKA: Two packed trains collided in Bangladesh on Tuesday, killing at least 16 people and injuring nearly 60 others, police said.<br/>Three coaches were sent crashing off the tracks at Mondobhag station in the town of Kasba when a Dhaka-bound train collided with one heading to Chittagong.<br/>“At least 16 people have been killed. And another 58 were injured. We have sent the injured to different hospitals in the region,” local police chief Anisur Rahman told AFP.<br/>Cranes and other lifting gear were brought in to rescue trapped passengers, many of whom were asleep when the early morning crash took place.<br/>“There was a loud noise, then I saw the train was completely ripped apart,” one injured passenger told Somoy TV.<br/>“All the people around me were crying. There was blood everywhere. Some people had broken hands and legs,” another told the broadcaster.</p>

      <p>“My son was with me. I still don’t know what happened to him,” the man added.<br/>Hayat ud Doula Khan, a government official in the district, said the Dhaka-bound Turna Nishitha train, hit the Chittagong-bound Udayan Express at about 3:00 am (2100 GMT Monday) as the Udayan was about to go through Mondobhog station.<br/>Khan told AFP that the Turna Nishitha train should have waited outside the station to let the other one pass. A Bangladesh railway official told reporters faulty signals could be to blame.<br/>“Three coaches were badly mangled and the victims are from these coaches,” Khan said, adding that train services out of Dhaka had been halted because of the accident.<br/>Train accidents are common in Bangladesh and are often caused by poor signalling or other rundown infrastructure.<br/>According to the Shipping and Communication Reporters Forum (SCRF), a private media research group, between January 1 and June 30 this year, at least 202 rail accidents took place in the South Asian country of 168 million people where some of the track is a century old.<br/>In June, a train plunged into a canal after the bridge it was crossing gave way. Five people were killed and 100 injured.<br/>The SCRF said pedestrians using mobile phones while crossing tracks, negligence by railway employees and poor maintenance of lines and bridges were the main cause of accidents.</p>
