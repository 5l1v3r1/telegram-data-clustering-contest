      <h1>Atiku speaks on hate speech bill by Nigerian Senate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:34:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/362605-atiku-speaks-on-hate-speech-bill-by-nigerian-senate.html" target="_blank">Samuel Ogundipe</a></address>
      <p>A former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, has cautioned Nigerian senators against moves to pass a bill criminalising purported hate speech.</p>
      <p>The bill being sponsored by Sabi Abdullahi of the All Progressives Congress is targeted at punishing anyone found guilty of spreading “misinformation.”</p>
      <p>The bill also prescribed death penalty for anyone found guilty of spreading a falsehood that led to the death of another person.</p>
      <p>But civic groups have been critical about the bill because of its narrow and unclear definition of what constitutes hate speech.</p>
      <p>The advocates argued that the Senate’s interpretation of ‘hate speech’ would be at odds with the Nigerian Constitution if the bill becomes law as designed. The Constitution protects the rights to unhindered speech, expression and association.</p>
      <p>Mr Abubakar aligned with those who believe the constitutional safeguards for free speech should be strengthened rather than undermined by lawmakers and other politicians in power.</p>
      <p>The former vice-president and main opposition candidate at the 2019 presidential election said the freedom of speech and other key elements of civil liberties which Nigerians enjoyed between 1999 and 2015 should not be taken away by the current administration.</p>
      <p>“It is prudent to build upon the tolerance inherited from those years and not shrink the democratic space to satisfy personal and group interests,” Mr Abubakar said in an emailed statement signed by his spokesperson, Paul Ibe.</p>
      <p>Efforts to regulate the media has been keenly considered and publicly pushed by politicians since Muhammadu Buhari assumed power in 2015.</p>
      <p>Mr Buhari has a history of brutal repression from his military era in the 1980s, a label from which he remained unflinching.</p>
      <p>The president has repeatedly told the country that his government will continue to ignore rights in favour of national security.</p>
      <p>Some of his appointees, especially information minister Lai Mohammed, have insisted Nigerians’ free speech will be curbed.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed said social media has become a tool of irresponsibility amongst elements determined to foment chaos in the country. He has equally overseen imposition of heavy fines on broadcast stations over alleged hate speech on their platforms.</p>
      <p>There were efforts to push a variation of the current hate speech bill through the parliament in 2015, but it failed amidst nationwide uproar.</p>
      <p>The reintroduced version contained essentially the same fundamentals and Nigerians have vowed to resist it as they did four years ago.</p>
      <p>Read Mr Abubakar’s full statement below:</p>
      <p>Atiku Abubakar wishes to sound a note of caution to those now toying with the idea of an Anti Hate Speech Bill, with punishment for supposed Hate Speech to be death by hanging. The contemplation of such laws is in itself not just hate speech, but an abuse of the legislative process that will violate Nigerians’ constitutionally guaranteed right to Freedom of Speech.</p>
      <p>Atiku urges those behind this Bill to awake to the fact that Nigeria’s democracy has survived its longest incarnation, because those who governed this great nation between 1999 and 2015 never toyed with this most fundamental of freedoms. It is prudent to build upon the tolerance inherited from those years and not shrink the democratic space to satisfy personal and group interests.</p>
      <p>Freedom of Speech was not just bestowed to Nigerians by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), it is also a divine right given to all men by their Creator. History is littered with the very negative unintended consequences that result when this God given right is obstructed by those who seek to intimidate the people rather than accommodate them.</p>
      <p>We should be reminded that history does not repeat itself. Rather, men repeat history. And often, to disastrous consequences.</p>
      <p>Nigeria presently has too many pressing concerns. We are now the world headquarters for extreme poverty as well as the global epicentre of out-of-school children. Our economy is smaller than it was in 2015, while our population is one of the world’s fastest growing. We have retrogressed in the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International, from the position we held four years ago, and our Human Development Indexes are abysmally low.</p>
      <p>It therefore begs the question: should we not rather make laws to tackle these pressing domestic challenges, instead of this Bill, which many citizens consider obnoxious?</p>
      <p>Again, Atiku cautions that we must prioritise our challenges ahead of the whims and caprices of those who do not like to hear the inconvenient truth. Stop this folly and focus on issues that matter to Nigerians.</p>
