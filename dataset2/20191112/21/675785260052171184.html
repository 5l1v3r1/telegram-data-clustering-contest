      <h1>Gareth Southgate has thrown Raheem Sterling under a bus - his decision will split 'The Group'</h1>
      <h2>The England boss opted to drop Sterling in a firm reaction to his bust-up with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez in the canteen at St George's Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:23:30+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Shortly after Gareth Southgate had spent 11 minutes dodging questions in the most unconvincing press conference of his time as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> manager, Callum Hudson-Odoi held court in a hotel function room.</p>
      <p>Predictably, and understandably, he was reluctant to speak about the specifics of canteen-gate.</p>
      <p>But he was more than happy to give Raheem Sterling as glowing a testimony as the chastised England exile could wish for.</p>
      <p>And yet Southgate had wanted us all to believe the sanctioning of ­Sterling would be understood and backed by the squad.</p>
      <p>Yeah, right.</p>
      <p>No matter what the player says publicly, no matter how deep any public contrition might seem, no matter how much Southgate ‘loves’ every member of his ‘family’, this ­embarrassment of Sterling will have ramifications.</p>

      <p>In his evasions of the dozen ­enquiries that were allowed, Southgate relentlessly repeated two words. The Group.</p>
      <p>Well, The Group will be splintered now, make no mistake.</p>
      <p>But let’s get this straight. The ­divisions will not be Team Joe and Team Raheem. Gomez, by common consent, is blameless in all this.</p>
      <p>The differences will be between those who believe the manager has acted appropriately and those who believe Southgate has thrown one of the most popular players in The Group under a bus.</p>
      <p>Which he has.</p>
      <p>The differences will be between those who believe the young man who has become such a fantastic ambassador for The Group deserved to be dropped for tomorrow’s match and those who believe it should have been sorted out in-house.</p>

      <p>Knock a couple of heads together and crack on.</p>
      <p>Southgate says he has done what he feels is in the best interests of The Group. But while it might have been one of his most uncomfortable media appearances since taking over in 2016, this punishment of Sterling smacks of grandstanding.</p>
      <p>What if the kerfuffle in the cafe had occurred three days before a World Cup semi-final and not three days before a Wembley tap-in against the hapless Montenegrins?</p>
      <p>You know the answer to that one.</p>
      <p>This is a gesture.</p>
      <p>Southgate has an affinity with a lot of the players who have come through the St George’s Park ­programme during his time in the England set-up. He gave Gomez his Under-21 debut and elevated him to the senior squad in November 2017.</p>

      <p>Gomez started in Liverpool’s opening-day 4-1 win over Norwich this season but has not been in Jurgen Klopp’s Premier League first XI since.</p>
      <p>He has, though, been selected for this England squad, just as he was selected for the one last month.</p>
      <p>This is not to suggest Southgate has his favourites. But the punishment handed out to Sterling was a gesture designed to show that developing players – normally developed through the junior teams in which Southgate puts so much faith - have the same rights as established stars. And that is right and proper, of course.</p>
      <p>But if Sterling and Gomez were prepared to bury their differences pretty sharpish, if the Manchester City man was prepared to quickly apologise to both the Liverpool defender and the rest of the England squad (as he has done), an admonishment and a warning would surely have been sufficient.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While victory against Montenegro is a formality with whatever personnel Southgate chooses to field, it will still be a landmark occasion at ­Wembley. It is England’s 1,000th international fixture. What part, if any, Sterling will play is unclear.</p>
      <p>As a player with over 50 caps, he should be a guest of honour.</p>
      <p>But one thing is for certain – he will not be celebrated while performing on the pitch.</p>
      <p>And considering how – until now and a regrettable moment when emotion got the better of him – he has conducted himself in the England shirt, that will be a shame.</p>
