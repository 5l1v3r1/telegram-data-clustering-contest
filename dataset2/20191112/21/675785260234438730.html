      <p>A teenage girl was savagely stabbed by her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend who was egged on by his current partner.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was left with life-threatening injuries after she was brutalised in her Greater Manchester home.</p>
      <p>The attack was launched after ex-boyfriend's current partner found out he was still seeing her behind her back.</p>
      <p>His betrayal having been found out, the boy set about trying to "prove his love" for his new partner by attacking the ex-girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The crime was detailed in a string of messages in which the victim describing the moments before she was stabbed.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>On the night of May 4 the boy turned up at the victim's home armed with a large kitchen knife and carrying a change of clothes.</p>
      <p>He told his ex-girlfriend he had been "ordered to kill her" before asking if she would kill herself for him.</p>
      <p>The teenager even suggested she put make up on her neck to make it look like she had been strangled, so they could take a picture and pretend he had killed her.</p>
      <p>He had been told to get photographic evidence by his current girlfriend, who was waiting outside.</p>
      <p>In the two hours she spent outside the property while the victim was terrorised inside, the jealous teenager sent more than 50 texts encouraging him.</p>
      <p>She had been "incensed" and "felt humiliated" when she learned of her partner seeing his former girlfriend.</p>
      <p>And she had told him that he would "have to work hard to win back her affections".</p>
      <p>The day before the attack he searched online for 'asphyxiation', 'how many years is someone in for murder' and 'how long do murderers serve in prison'.</p>
      <p>On the day of the attack, he told his girlfriend: "I’m doing it now."</p>
      <p>"Vid it then delete it when I see it please. I cannot stop crying," she replied.</p>
      <p>"Vid it," she continued.</p>
      <p>The victim would later describe her attacker as "like Jekyll and Hyde".</p>
      <p>In the moments before he turned on the victim with the knife, she cried out for her sister and pleaded "let me out".</p>
      <p>Instead he launched a savage attack.</p>
      <p>In a garden at the side of her house he took what the victim described as "massive kitchen meat knife" and attacked her head, neck, armpit and back.</p>
      <p>It was mere good fortune, jurors at Manchester Crown Court would be told in this month's trial, that she survived.</p>
      <p>"Done it…you good that I did it", he texted his current girlfriend, and subsequent co-defendant, in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>"Bare weight lifted," she replied.</p>
      <p>Then, a flurry of further messages from her.</p>
      <p>"Love you."</p>
      <p>"Did you get rid of the phone?"</p>
      <p>"Leave fast."</p>
      <p>"Undies (slang for police) on the area."</p>
      <p>"Show me vid."</p>
      <p>"Leave now."</p>
      <p>"We got sh*t to do."</p>
      <p>"Why aren’t you replying?"</p>
      <p>And then, as she became suspicious he hadn't gone through with it: "Hurry up, what’s taking so long?"</p>

      <p>After the pair had left the area, while the victim was bleeding from ten wounds, the attacker told his lover: “I did it to prove I love you…there was no other way to keep you."</p>
      <p>"I know there wasn’t…I’m gonna protect you at all costs", she replied.</p>
      <p>"Just breathe, calm down, make sure you feel alright," she went on, adding, "on Tuesday I’ll link you and have an entire identity change n get rid of everything alright....I would have done the same for you."</p>
      <p>Instead, the boy was arrested within minutes on suspicion of attempted murder, found standing at a bus stop with two Matalan bags - stuffed with bloodstained clothes and the weapon used in the attempted murder.</p>
      <p>Earlier that day, his girlfriend and accomplice had bought Dettol wipes to clean the knife with.</p>
      <p>The boy went on to deny attempted murder, although he didn't give evidence in his defence, while his girlfriend denied intentionally encouraging or assisting the boy to commit murder.</p>
      <p>Both were found unanimously guilty of those offences, although the boy was cleared of rape.</p>
      <p>At trial, his co-defendant said she thought her boyfriend was going to her love rival's house to split up with her for good.</p>
      <p>She claimed that when she said 'vid it', she only wanted him to film evidence of the break-up.</p>
      <p>But the texts damned her.</p>
      <p>They proved she not only knew what he was doing, but goaded him on and advised him on how to try and get away with it.</p>
      <p>It was, as jurors were told by the prosecutor, "unbelievable... but for the fact that it actually happened".</p>
      <p>Judge Alan Conrad QC adjourned the case for sentencing next month</p>
