      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lucie-donlan">Lucie Donlan</a> was in danger of revealing a little too much as she slipped into a busty dress at ITV's glitzy Palooza in London at Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, tonight.</p>
      <p>The surfer chick, 21, wowed in a sizzling fishtail gown with a keyhole neckline, which gave a daring flash at her ample cleavage.</p>
      <p>The telly star was nearly showing off more than she bargained for in her risqué black gown which had a plunging center feature.</p>
      <p>It appeared the star nearly suffered a wardrobe malfunction after she was snapped adjusting herself in the not-so-forgiving outfit.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the near wardrobe mishap, Lucie continued to showcase her incredible hourglass figure in the figure hugging dress as she posed up a storm on the red carpet.</p>
      <p>The beauty screamed sexiness as she wore her blonde locks in a tousled wet style and rocked an edgy make-up look with smoky eyeshadow.</p>

      <p>The reality star was joined by her handsome beau Joe Garratt who looked dapper at the event in a smart black tux.</p>
      <p>The smitten pair joined the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vicky-pattison">Vicky Pattison</a> , Gemma Collins and Ferne McCann at the glamorous London event.</p>
      <p>While the 2019 Love Island squad was in full force with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/maura-higgins">Maura Higgins</a> , Amber Gill, Amy Hart and Tommy Fury all dazzling on the red carpet.</p>

      <p>Lucie revealed back in September that she and Joe had never split up after the Love Island villa, and had been secretly dating.</p>
      <p>Theirs wasn't a smooth path to romance though, as other boys and girls in the villa threw spanners in the works.</p>
      <p>On Day One, Lucie chose to couple up with the sandwich maker without a second thought.</p>
      <p>After Curtis Pritchard and Tommy Fury rocked up though, second-place winning Tommy chose to couple up with the surfer babe.</p>

      <p>She coupled up with Joe again, but before he was dumped from the island, he incurred the wrath of fans by telling her she shouldn't be spending so much time with Tommy.</p>
      <p>He wanted her to be putting her time into friendships with the girls instead, which didn't go down well and had him branded controlling and manipulative.</p>
      <p>Still, after Lucie was dumped alongside Casa Amor beau George, she seemed to find the spark with Joe again and the couple are still going strong!</p>
