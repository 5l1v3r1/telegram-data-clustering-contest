      <p>PATERSON, N.J. -- A 3-month-old pit bull puppy is recovering after he was reportedly lit on fire with a blowtorch in New Jersey.<br/><br/>Ramapo-Bergen Animal Refuge, Inc. says Tyler was discovered by a good Samaritan a week ago. That witness said they saw Tyler and another dog lit on fire.<br/><br/>The good Samaritan tried to treat Tyler's wounds for a week, but his injuries were too severe, so he was taken to Oradell Animal Hospital on Sunday night.<br/><br/>Tyler's burn wounds are severe and he is now receiving emergency medical care.<br/><br/>Doctors had to cut away dead skin in order to treat his injuries and doctors expect his wounds will get worse before they get better.<br/><br/>He is currently on fluids and may require a plasma transfusion.<br/><br/>"Tyler is a victim, yes, but he is also a hero as he speaks to the perseverance and forgiving nature of dogs, particularly pit bulls, who are by far the most abused, exploited and misunderstood breed," RBARI said in a statement.<br/><br/>The rescue group says the incident happened in an area known for dog fighting and they have rescued other dog fighting victims from there before.<br/><br/>The fate of the second dog is unknown, but authorities were contacted and anyone with information is asked to call RBARI or the Paterson Police Department.</p>
