      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/sharks">shark</a> attacked an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/americas">American</a> diver off the coast of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/mexico">Mexico</a> on Monday, taking a bite out of his forearm, officials said.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old victim, whose name and hometown have not been publicly released, was bitten while diving in Magdalena Bay, located near Baja California Sur off northwestern Mexico, according to the Mexican Navy.</p>
      <p>The man was able to swim on his own back to his charter boat in the Pacific near San Carlos and call for help, officials said.</p>

      <p>Officials didn’t release any information on the species of shark involved in the attack.</p>
      <p>Shark attacks in Mexico have been seen as relatively uncommon. There have been at least 39 confirmed unprovoked shark attacks in Mexico since 1907, according to the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/maps/na/mexico/">Florida Museum’s International Shark File</a>.</p>
