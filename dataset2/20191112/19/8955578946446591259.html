      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 12 – RIA Tomsk.</b> Local Society of European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (EAGE) is opened on the basis of Training and Retraining Center for Petroleum and Gas Specialists of <a href="https://tpu.ru/en">Tomsk Polytechnic University</a> (TPU); it will help to unite professionals from Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk, the press service of the university reported on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>EAGE is a professional association of geologists, geophysicists, engineers and Earth sciences professionals founded in 1951. It brings together more than 19,000 members from more than 100 countries around the world and is a global network of scientists and specialists professionally involved in general geology, geophysics, oil and gas geology, field development, mine operation or study geosciences.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that in September 2017, the student branch of EAGE was established in TPU.</p>
      <h4>Association of professionals</h4>
      <p>"The local society European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (EAGE) was opened on the basis of the Training and Retraining Center for Petroleum and Gas Specialists of TPU", – the press service of the university reports.</p>
      <p>It is noted that the society will help to unite professionals from Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk.</p>
      <blockquote>"Tomsk is a central point for these three Siberian cities, where various events can take place, attracting people with the same professional interests", – the director of the Regional Office of EAGE in Russia and CIS countries Mikhail Novikov said at the opening ceremony of the society, his words are given in the message.</blockquote>
      <p>The presence of a local society will allow EAGE members not only to enjoy the many privileges of the global association, but also to host the world's leading experts with scientific and practical lectures and seminars, the press service of TPU adds.</p>
      <h4>Why in TPU?</h4>

      <p>With reference to Novikov it is reported that the powerful local society EAGE in the past worked in Novosibirsk: "But due to a number of reorganizations its activity decreased, it was also quite difficult to gather people together. At the same time in 2017 we met students and postgraduate students from Tomsk who showed considerable interest in what is being done at EAGE".</p>
      <p>"We realized that the local society in TPU will become a kind of magnet, which, first, will attract the best people in Tomsk, and, second, will tighten Krasnoyarsk and will allow to revive activity in Novosibirsk", – press service quotes Novikov.</p>
      <p>The list of events in Tomsk under the auspices of EAGE, according to the Director of the Regional Office of EAGE in Russia and CIS countries, depends on the activity of the members of the association themselves. At the same time Novikov is sure that the active role in the work of the local society will be played by Tomsk Polytechnic University.</p>
