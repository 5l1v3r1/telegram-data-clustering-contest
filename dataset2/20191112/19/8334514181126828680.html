      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s governing Conservative Party was hit by a cyber attack on Tuesday which tried to force its website offline, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The attack began shortly before 1600 GMT and lasted for less than an hour without managing to take down any party websites, the sources said.</p>
      <p>A Conservative Party spokeswoman had no immediate comment and said she was unaware of the attack.</p>
      <p>One of the sources said the attackers appeared to be different from those responsible for two back-to-back attacks on the main opposition Labour Party on Monday and earlier on Tuesday.</p>
