      <h1>Sex text ex Tory MP Andrew Griffiths stands aside - to back bid by his wife</h1>
      <h2>He did not get the support he needed from his local Conservative party in Burton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:42:43+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Disgraced former Tory MP Andrew Griffiths has given up his bid to contest the seat again but will back a bid by his wife.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffiths, who was exposed sending a barmaid and her pal £700 and offering to rent a flat to meet for sex, has failed to win the outright majority he needs to stand again in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>The politician, who has represented the constituency for nine years, failed to gain the majority he needed from the local party last night.</p>
      <p>And he decided to withdraw ahead of the meeting rather than face a second humiliating defeat.</p>
      <p>It came after the Chair, President and all officers of East Staffordshire Conservative Association said they did not support his candidacy for the Burton parliamentary seat.</p>
      <p>But instead Kate Griffiths has put herself forward for the Conservative nomination alongside former MP Stewart Jackson and Virginia Crosbie.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffiths, who is married with a baby girl, said he contemplated suicide after he was  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/business-minister-andrew-griffiths-quits-12918866">exposed by the Sunday Mirror</a>  for sexting barmaid Imogen Treharne, 28, and her friend.</p>
      <p>He resigned as a government minister and blamed the behavior on a series of personal tragedies.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffiths said he was abused as an eight year old by a 15-year-old boy, suffered depression as he and his wife struggled to conceive a child, and learnt that his brother had been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-andrew-griffiths-lewd-12919733">In the “sexts”</a> sent while he was minister for small business, Griffiths called himself “Daddy”, promised money for sexy photos, and described sex he claimed to have had with other women.</p>

      <p>The Sunday Mirror revealed how the new dad sent Treharne and her pal £700 and offered to rent a flat to meet for sex.</p>
      <p>He demanded explicit photos and videos and described degrading sex acts in crude detail.</p>
      <p>Standards chiefs ruled they could “not be sure” Mr Griffiths, 48, sent or received explicit messages when he would have been “engaged in Parliamentary activities”.</p>
      <p>But the probe ruled some were sent during office hours.</p>
      <p>Evidence shows several were sent in close proximity to Commons votes he took part in.</p>

      <p>One to Imogen Treharne was at 4.22pm as a vote on an EU matter was taking place.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffiths sent 2,000 texts in all, referring to himself as “Daddy” and outlining sex acts.</p>
      <p>After last night's vote he said: "I am pleased to have received so much support last night and frustrated to fall just one vote short.</p>
      <p>"I am looking forward to tonight's meeting so that I can further explain my record of success in delivering for Burton and Uttoxeter.</p>
      <p>"Having voted every time in parliament for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , I want the chance to finish the job and deliver on the promise to respect the referendum and get us out of the EU."</p>
      <p>East Staffordshire Conservative Association chairman Wileman said: "Andrew was not adopted [last night] as he needs a majority.</p>
      <p>"Both sides [of support and opposition for Mr Griffiths] were heckling each other.</p>
      <p>"Questions were allowed but only brief ones which had been sifted through beforehand, rather than members being allowed to put their hands up.</p>

      <p>"A sitting MP needs to secure a majority so there is a second meeting tonight.</p>
      <p>"Andrew will have the right to be there as will other candidates.</p>
      <p>"I am not aware of who they are as the candidate selection process is coordinated nationally.</p>
      <p>"There has been frustration for some considerable time. There is a feeling of anger within the association that the decision should be made locally as people know their members.</p>
      <p>"I would imagine that given it is such a contentious issue that the party nationally needs to have some control over it.</p>
      <p>"A significant amount of members were concerned about how the process was carried out and has caused anger and frustration about the process itself.</p>
      <p>"We haven't yet received an application from Andrew to stand tonight, but I understand he may well stand and then there will be other candidates who will be able to apply.</p>
      <p>"We clearly wanted a selection process so members could have their say."</p>
