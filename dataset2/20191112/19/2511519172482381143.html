      <h2>Help fight for a fair and honest election</h2>

      <p>The upcoming UK <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/general-election">general election</a> will be fought on social media more than any other. And that's why we need you to send us any political advertising you seen on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Facebook">Facebook</a> or any other site.</p>
      <p>Social media is already hosting a vast number of ads, paid for with huge sums of money, from all of the biggest parties. But it can be hard to keep track of those posts, which can be targeted so that just a few people see them and can include false or misleading claims.</p>
      <p>We're going to be cataloguing them through the election, drilling down into the things that political parties are trying to get out away from the eyes of the media. But we need your help to do it, and can only do so if you share those ads that you see.</p>
      <p>
        <b>If you see anything at all – whether you think it is suspect or not – then send all the information you have to <a href="http://mailto:digitaldemocracy@independent.co.uk/">digitaldemocracy@independent.co.uk</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don't feel that you only need to send sponsored ads, either. If you see political posts, images or graphics on social media that seem to be making questionable claims, you should send them to us too, and we'll investigate and fact check them.</p>
      <p>Everything you send in will be picked over by our journalists, scouring the posts for truths and lies as well as working to understand how parties are trying to sway voters.</p>
      <p>By doing so, together we can fight to keep this election as free, honest and transparent as possible – without fear or favour to any particular party.</p>
      <p>Social media will set the future of Brexit and the country. So let's make sure it does so fairly.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Social media is an increasingly important battle ground in elections - and home to many questionable claims pumped out by all sides. If social media sites won't investigate the truth of divisive advertising, we will. Please send any political Facebook advertising you receive to <a href="http://mailto:digitaldemocracy@independent.co.uk/">digitaldemocracy@independent.co.uk</a>, and we will catalogue and investigate it. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/general-election-facebook-political-advertising-infact-a9199551.html">Read more here</a>.</i>
