      <p>Egyptian officials said Cairo is attempting to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Palestinian factions in Gaza amid the worst bout of fighting there in recent months.<br/><br/>The officials said Egypt's general intelligence agency has stepped up communications and has "opened channels" with the US and the European Union, reported The Associated Press.<br/><br/>Egypt often acts as a mediator between Israel and Gaza factions, and brokered a ceasefire deal in May.<br/><br/>That deal appeared threatened Tuesday after a pre-dawn Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed senior Islamic Jihad commander Baha Abu al-Ata.<br/><br/>Syrian state media said a separate missile attack had hit the home of a Jihad official in Damascus, killing two people including one of his sons.<br/><br/>Syria said Israel carried out the Damascus strike. Israel did not comment.<br/><br/>Factions in Gaza have responded with rockets fired into Israel, reaching as far as Tel Aviv. The Israeli military has carried out a number of airstrikes in Gaza.<br/><br/>Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the strike that killed Ata.<br/><br/>In a statement Tuesday, Daifallah al-Fayez, a spokesman for the Jordanian foreign ministry, blamed Israel for the ensuing escalation in violence.<br/><br/>He said the fighting "will only increase tension and violence, deepen the environment of despair and promote extremist agendas in the region."<br/><br/>He called for Israel and the Palestinians to return to negotiations, saying that talks, along with an end to the Israeli blockade on the territory, could bring a solution to Gaza's woes.</p>
