      <h1>Niamh McCarthy Claims Bronze At World Para Athletics Championships</h1>

        <b><a href="https://twitter.com/niamhmacdiscus?lang=en">Niamh McCarthy</a> has taken home a bronze medal for Ireland in the discus F41 category at the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Cork native is Ireland’s first medal winner of the games so far.</p>
      <p>A throw of 29.70 metres in her fourth attempt of the final was enough to leave her in the bronze medal position, however, she had to wait for confirmation of her third-place finish as six competitors attempted to beat her score.</p>
      <p>Tunisia’s Raoua Tlili took home the gold medal with a throw of 34.48 metres while Morocco’s Youssra Karim placed second with an effort of 33.59 metres.</p>

      <p>McCarthy’s performance marks her third time medalling in the event at the World Championships after also taking home a bronze medal in Doha back in 2015 while she finished second in London in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Cork woman, who took home a silver medal in the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio, looks like a fantastic shout for honours at Tokyo 2020.</p>
