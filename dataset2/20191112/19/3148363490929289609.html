      <h1>Disney+ Slaps Trigger Warnings on 'Dumbo,' 'Lady and the Tramp' over 'Outdated Cultural Depictions'</h1>
      <h2>The new Disney+ streaming service has added social justice trigger warnings to some of its classic movie titles, telling subscribers that beloved Disney movies including Dumbo, Swiss Family Robinson, Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier, and the original Lady and the Tramp may contain “outdated cultural depictions.”</h2>

      <p>The generic trigger warnings appear in the plot synopses that users see on the Disney+ interface before clicking to play a title.</p>
      <p>“This program is presented as originally created,” the warnings say. “It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”</p>

      <p>The warnings appear to focus on titles that depict indigenous people, African Americans, Asians, and other minorities in ways that some now regard as stereotypical.</p>
      <p>The original animated <i>Dumbo</i>, which was first released in 1941, features a supporting cast that includes a flock of black crows whose mannerisms and voices are now considered to be racist depictions of black Americans.</p>

      <p>Contemporary cultural critics have also cited the portrayal of Native Americans in <i>Davy Crockett</i> (1955) and Southeast Asians in <i>Swiss Family Robinson</i> (1960) as racist.</p>
      <p><i>Lady and the Tramp</i>, the original 1955 animated movie, features the musical sequence “We Are Siamese,” performed by a pair of Siamese cats in whispery, Asian-accented voices.</p>

      <p>Disney+ has even slapped a trigger warning on the 1942 animated short film <i>How to Fish</i>, featuring Goofy. It remains unclear how the seven-minute film could be construed as offensive.</p>
      <p>The new streaming service, which debuted Tuesday, is one of the multimedia giant’s most ambitious efforts to date. But <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/11/12/disney-apologizes-after-streaming-service-crashes-on-launch-day/">technical problems</a> have marred the service’s big unveil, with many subscribers saying on social media that they have had problems connecting to the platform.</p>
      <p>Before it launched this week, some media outlets wondered if the streamer would include the controversial 1946 Disney movie <i>Song of the South</i>, which features a character named Uncle Remus and is set during Reconstruction.</p>
      <p>A search of Disney+ on Tuesday couldn’t find <i>Song of the South</i> on the platform.</p>
