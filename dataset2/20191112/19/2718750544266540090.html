      <p>Turns out there’s one aspect of early-aughts nostalgia that the creators and stars of Hulu’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/pen15-season-2-details.html"><i>Pen15</i></a> haven’t yet incorporated into the show. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Crazy_(game)"><i>Boy Crazy</i></a>, a card game for girls who are just crazy about boys, is something we were more than happy to bring into their lives. Comedian Jamie Loftus played a couple rounds with them when they stopped by our video studio at Vulture Festival, and they made some predictions about what has become of these boys.</p>
