      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:50:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson has sent an extra 100 troops to help areas of the north and midlands devastated by severe flooding.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister was desperate to get on the front foot after criticism of the government's sluggish response.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also pledged thousands of pounds to help the worst-hit communities after being pressured into holding an emergency meeting by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson announced a business fund £2,500 would be made available to businesses affected by flooding, while the equivalent of £500 per household would be offered to councils to help communities with their immediate recovery.</p>
      <p>An extra 100 UK Armed Forces personnel will also be deployed to South Yorkshire to help support the recovery effort.</p>
      <p>And the UK Standby Battalion, based in Catterick, will be deployed from tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Speaking after a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee, he said the country had to "prepare for more floods" this winter because the ground is so waterlogged.</p>

      <p>He said: "The worry for me is that there are some people who are continuing not to listen to the advice of the emergency services.</p>
      <p>"I would just say to people - the emergency services do have sound advice. When they advise you to evacuate, you should do so."</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister urged people in flood-hit areas to listen to the emergency services as he warned there could be more flooding across the country this winter.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson added: "In the next few weeks and months, the rainfall could cause flooding in many parts of the country and we simply have to be prepared." <br/>He said the authorities are working "flat out" to deliver an adequate response, adding: "I know there will be people who feel that that isn't good enough.</p>
      <p>"I know there will be people who are worrying about the damage to their homes, who will be worried about the insurance situation, worried about the losses they face.</p>
      <p>"All I want to say to those people is that there are schemes to cover those losses."</p>
