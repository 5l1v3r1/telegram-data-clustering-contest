      <p>A message in a bottle was found in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france">France</a> last month nearly a decade after it was thrown into the ocean by a 9-year-old in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Max Vredenburgh, now a 19-year-old college student at Suffolk University, put a letter in a glass wine bottle and threw it into the ocean from Rockport, a fishing town north of Boston, in August 2010, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/11/message-in-bottle-response-france">The Guardian reported</a>.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Vredenburgh’s father texted him that a person named “G. Dubois” found Vredenburgh’s bottle on a beach in southern France in early October.</p>

      <p>“On August 21, 2010, I threw a message in a bottle into the ocean from a beach in Rockport, MA,” wrote Vredenburgh on Twitter. “On October 10, 2019 that letter was found on the beach in France. I am mind blown. 9 years.”</p>
      <p>The tweet showed Vredenburgh’s original letter and a response from Dubois that included a map of where the bottle was found.</p>

      <p>The 10-year-old Vredenburgh wrote that he likes apples, the beach and outer space, and requested whoever finds his letter to reply.</p>
      <p>“Hello, I found your message in your bottle on October 10, 2019 on a beach in France, between Contis and Mimizan,” writes Dubois. “According to your date, August 21, (2010), it will have taken 9 years to cover the 6000kms (3,730 miles) that separates us.”</p>
      <p>Vredenburgh told Boston's <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/wow-suffolk-university-student-gets-reply-to-message-in-bottle-he-sent-nearly-10-years-ago/29766420">WCVB 5</a> he plans to write back to Dubois, who provided an address.</p>

      <p>“It’s the human connection and, for me, it hit me on an emotional level because I reflected on myself and my past,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think, for other people, it might be doing the same,” Vredenburgh said.</p>
