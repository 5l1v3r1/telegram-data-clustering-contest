      <h1>Report: ‘Friends’ Reunion Special In The Works For HBO Max</h1>

      <p>Could “Friends” fans <i>be </i>more excited?</p>
      <p>That’s what they’ll be asking themselves now that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-reunion-special-works-at-hbo-max-1254331?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_2019-11-12%2015:45:00_lgoldberg&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> is reporting that a reunion of the beloved sitcom is being developed for HBO Max, the new streaming service set to launch in the spring.</p>
      <p>Sources tell <i>THR</i> that series creators David Crane and Marta Kaufman, and the show’s six stars — Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer — are all in discussions for what’s described as “an unscripted reunion special.”</p>

      <p>“Sources caution that a deal is far from done and agreements with cast and creatives still need to be hammered out,” <i>THR </i>points out. “When and <i>if</i> deals are completed, the challenge then becomes sorting out everyone’s schedules. Of course, the talks could fizzle and the whole concept could fall apart.”</p>
      <p>According to <i>THR</i>, Warner Bros. Television and HBO Max declined comment.</p>
      <p>While Netflix paid a reported $80-$100 million for one year of streaming rights for “Friends”, that deal winds up at the end of this year, with HBO Max to become the exclusive new streaming home of what’s become one of Netflix’s most-watched series.</p>
      <p>Earlier reports indicated that WarnerMedia (corporate parent of HBO Max) outbid Netflix to reclaim the rights, paying a reported $85 million per year for five years ($425 million).</p>

      <p>The news comes amidst rumours that some kind of “Friends” reunion was in the works after Aniston confirmed that “something is happening” during a recent visit to <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/">“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert”</a>, although she added, “But we don’t know what that something is.”</p>
      <p>If it does happen, an unscripted reunion would make the most sense, as the series’ creators and stars have repeatedly declared over the years that they have zero interest in returning to Central Perk for a revival.</p>
