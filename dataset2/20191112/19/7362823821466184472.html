      <p>The former Olympic skier, 42, and the professional beach volleyball player, 32, welcomed their family's newest additions on Friday, the couple revealed Tuesday during a phone interview with the <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/bode-morgan-miller-have-welcomed-twins-it-was-pure-magic-t164818">"Today" show</a>.</p>
      <p>"I'm doing really well. We're still floating from the whole experience," Morgan said. "It was just so amazing to have it go as spontaneous but as well as it did."</p>

      <p>According to Bode, the midwives didn't arrive on time because Morgan told them she had a bit of time before the babies' arrival.</p>
      <p>"By the time they got there, me and my mom were holding the babies," he recalled. "Luckily my mom was a midwife, but she hadn't delivered babies in 20-plus years, and she never delivered twins.</p>

      <p>"We were both pretty relaxed and pretty casual, but we were certainly not qualified to be doing an unassisted home delivery of twins!" Bode added.</p>
      <p>Gushed Morgan: "For Bode to get to deliver his identical twin boys with his mom — it was just pure magic."</p>
