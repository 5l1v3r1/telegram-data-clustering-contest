      <h1>Trump Predicted More Leaks Amid WikiLeaks Releases in 2016, Ex-Aide Testifies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:10:43+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author">Sharon LaFraniere and Zach Montague</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Days after the rogue website WikiLeaks posted a trove of stolen Democratic Party emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked by phone with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime friend who claimed to have connections to WikiLeaks, then told a top aide that “more information would be coming,” the aide testified in Mr. Stone’s criminal trial on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The aide, Rick Gates, said he did not hear the substance of the July 31, 2016, call. Nor did he say that Mr. Trump mentioned WikiLeaks, the organization had received tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian operatives seeking to sabotage the campaign of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>But the context of the exchange suggests that Mr. Stone briefed Mr. Trump on whatever he had picked up about the website’s plans. In written answers that President Trump supplied during the special counsel’s investigation of Russian influence in the campaign, he said he did not recall the specifics of any his 21 phone calls with Mr. Stone in the six months before the election. He also said he did not recall knowing that his campaign advisers were in touch with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gates’s testimony revealed other new details about the Trump campaign’s intense interest in how WikiLeaks might disrupt Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Much of what he said in court was covered in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html?module=inline">Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report</a> but was blacked out in the version released publicly last spring to protect grand jury secrecy or ongoing cases, a person familiar with the report said.</p>
      <p>As early as April 2016, Mr. Gates testified, Mr. Stone had predicted to campaign officials that WikiLeaks would release information helpful to Mr. Trump. That was roughly three months before WikiLeaks released its first tranche of stolen emails, throwing the Clinton campaign on the defensive on the eve of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
      <p>“It was, in a way, a gift,” Mr. Gates testified about the July 22 release of tens of thousands of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. He said the Trump campaign was “in a state of happiness” that Mr. Stone’s predictions had come true.</p>
      <p>Mr. Stone, a former Trump campaign aide and 40-year friend of the president, repeatedly told top campaign officials that he was privy to inside information from WikiLeaks through his connections with Julian Assange, the organization’s founder. He now says that he was only boasting and had access to only public sources of information.</p>
      <p>Phone records introduced into evidence in Mr. Stone’s trial suggest that he kept in close touch with Mr. Trump and his top campaign aides. Between March and November 2016, the records show, Mr. Stone had 39 calls with Mr. Trump, 126 calls with Mr. Gates and 153 calls with Paul Manafort, who was forced to resign as campaign chairman in August but continued to informally advise the campaign.</p>
      <p>In the final three months of the race, Mr. Stone tried to dispatch two intermediaries to get either stolen emails or information from Mr. Assange. Both of them have testified under oath that they were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>After its July 22 release, WikiLeaks went dark for months. Then at a critical moment, it released thousands of emails stolen from the account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. That release distracted attention from an explosive audio tape in which Mr. Trump was heard bragging about grabbing women’s genitals.</p>
      <p>Mr. Stone is on trial for lying to the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks and with trying to block the testimony of another witness whose account would have contradicted his. At the time, the committee conducting a parallel inquiry to Mr. Mueller’s into Russian interference in the election, including the role of WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim that Mr. Stone lied because the truth about his efforts to reach WikiLeaks would have embarrassed Mr. Trump and his campaign. They rested their case Tuesday after presenting four days of evidence.</p>
      <p>Defense lawyers have argued that Mr. Stone never deliberately misled congressional investigators, but simply confined his answers to what he believed were the strict parameters of the committee’s inquiry. They played a 50-minute-long recording of Mr. Stone’s testimony to the House committee, then rested their case as well.</p>
      <p>Amy Berman Jackson, the federal judge overseeing the trial in Washington, said she expects the case to go the jury by Wednesday, far sooner than had been expected. The charges against Mr. Stone, 67, carry a maximum penalty of 20 years, although the punishment for a defendant with no criminal record, like Mr. Stone, would almost certainly be far lighter.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gates, who served as Mr. Trump’s deputy campaign chairman, has been a prominent witness in a series of criminal prosecutions by Mr. Mueller’s team against Mr. Trump’s former aides. After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/politics/rick-gates-guilty-plea-mueller-investigation.html?module=inline">pleading guilty to conspiracy and lying</a> to federal investigators in early 2018, he testified about financial crimes he committed with Mr. Manafort, who was convicted and is now serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison term.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gates, who may be sentenced next month, is hoping that his cooperation with federal prosecutors will spare him a prison term, leaving him instead on probation. Overall, he said, federal investigators or prosecutors have interviewed him about 40 or 50 times.</p>
