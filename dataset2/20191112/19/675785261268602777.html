      <h1>Man Utd squad fly out to Dubai for warm weather training - without Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h1>
      <h2>Those players not on international duty travelled to the UAE for a three-day trip to prepare for United's next Premier League game against Sheffield United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:08:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>A number of key Manchester United players were pictured in a Dubai restaurant as they take advantage of the international break by engaging in some warm-weather training.</p>
      <p>The likes of Juan Mata, Ashley Young and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were all present in the Middle East country, but there was no sign of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who looks to have stayed in the UK.</p>
      <p>The squad were seen with celebrity chef Nusret Gökçe- otherwise known as Salt Bae- and Mata, Young, Wan-Bissaka, Lee Grant, Andreas Pereira, Axel Tuanzebe, Marcos Rojo and Fred can all be seen in the photo.</p>
      <p>The players are expected to stay in Dubai for two more days, training with United coaches, while teammates such as Marcus Rashford, Daniel James and Harry Maguire represent their countries.</p>

      <p>United have a number of injury issues, with Scott McTominay the latest to suffer after hurting his ankle towards the end of the weekend win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> , and the likes of he, Paul Pogba, Luke Shaw and Nemanja Matic were not present in Dubai, staying in Manchester instead to continue their rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>United face an intriguing-looking game against high-flying Sheffield United in their next game on November 24, but they should be full of confidence following their impressive performance in the 3-1 win over Brighton on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Following the victory Solskjaer said: "That was our best performance of the season. It was an excellent performance from the lads. When you see them going forward, it's a joy to watch.</p>

      <p>“How it didn't end up five, six or seven, we don't know, but it was exhilarating and entertaining and great to see the boys enjoy themselves.</p>
      <p>“It's been great these two games, with loads of attacking play. We should have had more goals, but the intentions are there and they're enjoying themselves</p>
      <p>“They young players are performing and learning. They've had some tough lessons, but they've learned from them."</p>
