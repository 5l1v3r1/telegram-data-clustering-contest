      <p>Saturday’s Soweto Derby saw reigning PSL Football of the Season, Thembinkosi Lorch versus a former winner in Khama Billiat. Which of the sides’ star players came out on top? </p>

        <b>Position</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this game, Rulani Mokwena used Lorch in a very attacking role, often the side’s central striker where he could make runs in behind the defence and would not have much defending to do. Later in the game, he moved slightly deeper after the introduction of Tshegofatso Mabasa but still played a more advanced role than usual.</p>
      <p>Khama Billiat was again used as the top of a midfield diamond, supporting the strike pairing of Leonardo Castro and Samir Nurkovic. Once Bernard Parker came on, Billiat was pushed higher up behind Nurkovic. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Scoring</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both players came to close to scoring in this game as Billiat tested Wayne Sandilands with a well-struck free-kick, whilst Lorch headed a golden chance against the post from close range. Overall, Lorch was more of a scoring threat with three shots compared to two from Billiat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Creativity</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this game, Billiat created just one shooting chance for a teammate, whilst Lorch created four, more than any other player on the pitch. In the second half, Vincent Pule was sent through on goal and struck the woodwork after Lorch’s lovely diagonal pass.</p>
      <p>The Pirates man also had 10 more touches in the game than Billiat and made eight more successful passes. Lorch made four successful forward passes compared to two for Billiat. These low numbers are not unexpected as both players were in advanced roles and did not often have runners in front of them.  </p>

      <p>
        <b>Defending</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this game, Lorch was not asked to do any tracking back at all, so it is no surprise that he did not make a single tackle. Billiat, meanwhile, attempted four tackles and won two of those. He gave a more battling performance than his counterpart.  </p>

        <b>Verdict</b>
      </p>
      <p>The performances of the two players reflected the performance of their teams on the day. Lorch came closest to scoring and created a clear-cut chance for Pule and three other openings. However, he did not contribute much off the ball. Billiat had very little attacking influence on the match, but fought hard for the team as Pirates had nearly 57% of the ball and made 128 more passes.</p>
