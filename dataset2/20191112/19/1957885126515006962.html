      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 12 November 2019</p>
      <p>Bethesda is giving players more ways to put Nazis in their place today, with the advent of Wolfenstein: Youngblood's free 1.07 content update, which adds two new locations to the game, new abilities, new end-game activities, and more.</p>
      <p>Youngblood's new areas - a Parisian reservoir and secret Nazi bunker to be precise - can be accessed once players have completed the Da'at Yichud Artifacts end-game side quest. With this out the way, the new Treasure Hunt side mission will unlock, sending players off in search of a Da'at Yichud chest, reported to be hidden away in a secret Nazi hideout.</p>
      <p>As noted in Bethesda's 1.07 <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4eK0AO4VGIii0kBWOnUmVx/wolfenstein-youngblood-update-1-0-7">release notes</a>, the new Parisian reservoir and Nazi bunker are home to three new enemy types: the Wurmlochsoldat (Teleporting Übersoldier), the Electrodrohne (Tesla Drone), and the Turmhund (Laserhund with a turret).</p>

      <p>Additionally, completing the quest will add 20 Treasure Maps to the Missions tab, leading to hidden artifacts, each rewarding XP, Silver Coins and one Ability Point.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, 1.07 extends all three of Wolfenstein: Youngblood's existing ability trees, adding the likes of Quick Revive to the Mind path, Dual Wield Expert to Muscle, and Silent Killer to Power. Power also gains the new God Key Sense ability, used for locating the game's new treasure. This, however, doesn't require players to spend an Ability Point to unlock, rather it's granted automatically after completing Da'at Yichud Artifacts.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the update are a selection of new skins and two new Pep Signals - Hammer Rage and Quad Damage - inspired by other id Software games. The first restores Heavy Weapon ammo for you and sis, while the second enables players to deal quad damage for four seconds.</p>
      <p>Wolfenstein: Youngblood's 1.07 content update is available now on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4, and will be making its way to Switch "soon".</p>
