      <p>LONDON: A cyber attack on Britain's opposition Labour Party was a short-lived and unsuccessful attempt to take the party's websites offline, a security official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>
      <p>An initial investigation indicated the attack was not particularly sophisticated, the official said. "It was really very everyday, nothing more than what you would expect to see on a regular basis."</p>

      <p>Labour said earlier on Tuesday it was subject to a large-scale cyber attack on its digital platforms but that it was confident no data breach occurred just weeks before a national election.</p>
