      <h1>The New ‘Sonic The Hedgehog’ Trailer Shows Off His New, Significantly Less Cursed Design</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:59:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, the first trailer for the upcoming <i>Sonic The Hedgehog </i>reboot was released. Safe to say, it didn’t go well.</p>
      <p>Within minutes of hitting the internet, the trailer was widely mocked. That was partly because it looked like an extremely odd ’90s anachronism, full of leaden jokes and stock character types, and partly because it was cut to the ill-fitting hip hop hit ‘Gangster’s Paradise’.</p>
      <p>But it was mostly because the new, hip Sonic looked very, very cursed.</p>
      <p>I mean, the dude had separated teeth and the blank, unfeeling eyes of a killer. He looked more like the antagonist of a Clive Barker horror film than a chirpy children’s film.</p>

      <p>In fact, the backlash against the design was so bad that after a few days, <a href="https://junkee.com/sonic-movie-2020/207212">the director announced that the film was going back into production in order to fix the mess.</a> An unprecedented move, surely, but also a deeply necessary one — separated teeth Sonic might have ended reality as we know it if he had been unleashed upon us.</p>
      <p>Well, the new trailer for the redesigned Sonic has just dropped. And you know what? Credit where credit is due: Sonic looks way better!</p>
      <p>You know what doesn’t look better, mind you?</p>
      <p>The rest of the film.</p>
      <p>Yep, while they have given the world-famous hedgehog more cartoony eyes, a cheerier demeanour, and a big, elegant smile, they don’t appear to have done anything about the boiler-plate jokes around him. The film still features a series of turgid one-liners, James Marsden looking absolutely befuddled by everything that is happening around him, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> absolutely going for broke in a way that he hasn’t since the mid-’90s.</p>
      <p><i>Sonic The Hedgehog</i> releases in Australia on February 13, 2020, whether we like it or not. You can watch the full, slightly less cursed trailer below:</p>
