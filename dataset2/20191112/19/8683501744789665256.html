      <p>It's almost hard to believe, but it's been a full calendar year since the world lost Stan Lee. The <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483711/how-writing-a-new-stan-lee-biography-changed-authors-view-of-marvels-hero">Marvel comics visionary</a> has had a massive impact on pop culture for the past few decades, and affected <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/2474159/everything-fans-should-know-about-stan-lee">generations of fans</a>. His passing at the age of 95 was heartbreaking, especially as it was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471843/stan-lee-didnt-get-to-see-avengers-endgame-before-he-died">prior to the release</a> of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. To honor Lee on the first anniversary of his death, Marvel Entertainment posted a beautiful tribute to the man behind so many stories.</p>
      <p>Stan Lee is responsible for creating some of the most iconic characters to come out of Marvel Comics. That includes the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor, and the X-Men. Lee also appeared in a ton of Marvel adaptations, with various studios giving Lee cameos throughout the years. You can see how Marvel Entertainment <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477187/marvels-stan-lee-has-been-given-his-own-street-in-the-bronx">honored the late writer</a> below.</p>

      <p>Well, that's gorgeous. Stan Lee is shown among his various creations, showing how limitless his imagination was. It's a great way to honor Lee on the first anniversary of his death, and as Marvel Studios continues to dominate pop culture.</p>
      <p>This new image comes to us from the official <a href="https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/1194297121857589248">Twitter</a> account for Marvel Entertainment. It shows Stan Lee's likeness, surrounded by some of the most iconic characters from the comics. The Fantastic Four and X-Men are at the top of the image, alongside Spider-Man, She-Hulk, and The Wasp. As you go further down the art, those heroes are joined by more iconic Marvel heroes including Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, and Silver Surfer. Clearly Lee contributed to a ton of characters, each with their own unique backstory and abilities.</p>
      <p>Stan Lee's death last year rocked the world of entertainment and comic books, and there were <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468031/captain-marvels-stan-lee-tribute-is-perfect">countless tributes</a> and honors to the late comic book writer. Many of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's biggest names took the time to thank Lee for his contributions, and for being so lovely to work with during his many onscreen cameos.</p>
      <p><i>Avengers: Endgame</i> marked <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471753/the-russo-brothers-share-set-photo-from-stan-lees-final-cameo">Stan Lee's final cameo</a>, as <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> and <i>Dark Phoenix</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469198/dark-phoenix-wont-have-a-stan-lee-cameo-but-it-will-have-a-tribute">didn't have any appearances</a> by the late visionary. He ended up having appearing in a ton of Marvel adaptations throughout his life, on both the small and silver screen. His most memorable are the countless movie appearances, all of which made audiences chuckle. What's more, his appearance in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i> confirmed his MCU appearances were all the same person.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Since his death, quite a bit has changed for his characters. <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> became the highest grossing movie of all time, and Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox will allow the X-Men and Fantastic Four to eventually appear in the MCU. What's more, a new deal for Spider-Man will allow Tom Holland's character to occupy both that universe, and Sony's Spider-Verse.</p>
      <p>The next installment in the MCU is <i>Black Widow</i> (also created by Stan Lee) on May 1st, 2020.
