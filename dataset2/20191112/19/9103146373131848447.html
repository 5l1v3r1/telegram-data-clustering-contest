        <b>What makes Miss International different from other global pageants?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Miss International is one of the top four most popular pageants in the world.</p>
      <p>Unlike Miss World or Miss Universe, that have mainly focused on health projects especially Miss World, Miss International's primary focus is on establishing international relations and cultural exchanges among nations.</p>
      <p>Miss International focuses on business, tourism, peace and international relations. It begun in 1960, in Tokyo Japan and has consistently been held there ever since by the Intercultural Association of Japan.</p>
      <p>The pageant emphasizes on building international relationships, promoting culture and lasting peace through activities that bring all the nationalities together, Miss International Uganda National Director Aketch explained.</p>
      <p>The goal for Miss International is to merge entertainment, fashion and design, architecture, arts and crafts by bringing out untapped talent among the youth within the country.</p>
      <p>Through extensive Miss international events, young people in the arts Industry also get to showcase to their talent to world.</p>
      <p>For Uganda there is more positive visibility of our creative industry which has potential to bring in various investment, job opportunities and tourism, Aketch says.</p>
      <p>Today in Tokyo Namatovu was only 2nd runners up but despite narrowly missing on the crown, Namatovu was handed the best swimsuit crown in Japan.</p>
