        <b>Police have launched an investigation into secret recordings made by a Welsh assembly member of the man who oversees complaints about AMs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Independent AM Neil McEvoy claimed his recordings of standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans revealed sexism and bias.</p>
      <p>Sir Roderick, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-50380445">who resigned on Monday</a>, said much of what had been shared was out of context and misleading.</p>
      <p>Mr McEvoy's actions prompted a security sweep of the assembly estate.</p>
      <p>South Wales Police said it had "commenced an investigation following a referral from the National Assembly for Wales concerning allegations of covert recordings".</p>
      <p>Mr McEvoy was facing three separate investigations by Sir Roderick.</p>

      <p>Opening assembly business on Tuesday, presiding officer Elin Jones said police had been asked to look into how the recordings were made and investigate their legality.</p>
      <p>"The covert recording of private conversations on the assembly estate is a serious breach of trust," she said.</p>
      <p>She alleged the recordings included confidential evidence by a witness during an investigation into Mr McEvoy's conduct.</p>
