      <h1>This heads or tails call in Monday Night Football is the new Yanny or Laurel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:26:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:26</time> by <a rel="author">WFTS Digital Staff</a></address>
      <p>In 2015 a blue and black (or white and gold depending who you ask) dress took the internet by storm and sparked a viral debate that people still don't agree upon to this day.</p>
      <p>Just when the madness had calmed down in 2018, a voice recording saying Laurel (or Yanny depending who you ask) sparked a similar debate. Family feuds were started, friends became enemies (ok maybe a little too dramatic but you get the point).</p>
      <p>November 11, 2019 has now given us a new viral debate.</p>
      <p>At the start of overtime in the Monday Night Football game between the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers, Seattle's Geno Smith made the call:</p>

      <p>The referee heard heads, and San Francisco's Richard Sherman didn't dispute it, but that's not stopping some keyboard warriors from insisting Smith said tails.</p>
      <p>Many claim that whichever option you think about, you hear it that way.</p>
      <p>The Seahawks won the toss and went on to win the game, but the internet remains in a state of unrest while we determine if heads truly is what Geno Smith called.</p>
      <p>What do you hear?</p>
