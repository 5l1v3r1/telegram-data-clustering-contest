      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German business software group SAP plans to streamline its hardware infrastructure while holding research development costs steady, an executive said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The measures, announced at SAP’s capital markets day, are aimed at helping Europe’s most valuable technology firm fulfil its promise of expanding profit margins by 5 percentage points through 2023.</p>
      <p>Luka Mucic, finance chief, said SAP will reduce the number of so-called stacks, or infrastructure such as servers and components that SAP has accumulated through multiple acquisitions.</p>
      <p>The budget for research and development will remain steady at 14% of revenue, he said.</p>
      <p>The company will also cut management costs and the number of its suppliers.</p>
      <p>The capital markets day was the first major outing for new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. The duo have taken over from long-time boss Bill McDermott, who is leaving to head up ServiceNow</p>
      <p>McDermott launched the efficiency drive to expand profit margins.</p>
      <p>(This story corrects headline, paragraphs 1 and 3 to say SAP is streamlining infrastructure, not cutting research centres, changes dateline to Frankfurt instead of London)</p>
