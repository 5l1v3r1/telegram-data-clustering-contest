      <p>Both Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy S10 are some of the great premium quality smartphones of 2019 and while specs-wise they’re quite close to each other, Note 10 has some useful features that are currently missing in the Galaxy S10 smartphones.</p>
      <p>Now, the good news is those powerful Note 10 features are going to be available for Galaxy S10 smartphones. In a <a href="http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/stories/experience-more-powerful-note10-features-on-the-galaxy-s10">blog post</a>, Samsung said:</p>
      <blockquote>Samsung Electronics has announced a fresh software update for the Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+ and S10 5G that introduces more powerful Galaxy Note10 features to the flagship lineup. Now, in addition to enjoying the diverse range of Note10 features that were added in the S10’s <a href="https://ww.9to5google.com/?load=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnNhbXN1bmcuY29tL2dsb2JhbC9zb2Z0d2FyZS11cGRhdGUtYnJpbmdzLXBvd2VyZnVsLWdhbGF4eS1ub3RlMTAtZmVhdHVyZXMtdG8tdGhlLWdhbGF4eS1zMTA&amp;r=1">most recent update</a>, users will be able to access all-new smart multimedia and Wi-Fi functions that streamline connections and take content creation to the next level.</blockquote>
      <p>The Galaxy S10 will have the same Gallery app that you find on the Note 10. This means S10 smartphone users will be able to quickly search for their favorite photos and videos using keywords like “Cats” or “Dogs” in the Gallery app.</p>
      <p>Another Note 10 feature that is coming to S10 smartphones is the ‘Media’ option in the settings panel. This will bring up content recommendations from various multimedia streaming apps. Also, you’ll be able to control other wirelessly connected devices such as wireless speakers and Samsung smart TVs.</p>
      <p>Galaxy Note 10’s Auto Wi-Fi feature is going to be available for Galaxy S10 users too. With Auto Wi-Fi, S10 users will be able to establish a hotspot automatically with other Samsung devices if they share the same Samsung account or family account.</p>
      <p>Another powerful Note 10 feature is the AR Doodles, which will let users “add a personal touch to videos with fun, vibrant drawings” and for that, you don’t have to rely on S Pen. With Galaxy S10, you’ll also be able to do similar things. Live Focus, Live Focus Video, and Night Mode for the front camera are also coming.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s Galaxy S10 is going to become a pocket-sized multi-media device just like the Note 10. S10 users will be able to trim, edit, and personalize video clips with precision on Samsung DeX by connecting the S10 to a PC or Mac with a USB cable.</p>
      <p>Note, Samsung is currently rolling out these new features in a phased manner, meaning that not everyone will get the update today. So, if you’re an S10 owner and haven’t received any update, you’ll have to wait a few more days to get the update.</p>
