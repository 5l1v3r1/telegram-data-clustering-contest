      <p>TOWN OF BEAVER DAM, Wis. - Road conditions were a factor in a crash involving a car and school bus in Dodge County Tuesday morning, officials said. </p>
      <p>The Dodge County Sheriff's Office said deputies responded at 8 a.m. to a two-vehicle crash on Niblick Road in the town of Beaver Dam. There were 10 Prairie View Elementary students on the bus. None of the students nor the bus driver reported injuries at the scene. </p>
      <p>According to the report, a car driven by a 16-year-old town of Beaver Dam boy was headed west on Niblick Road when it lost control on the snow- and ice-covered road. The car crossed into the oncoming lane and struck the bus.</p>
      <p>The sheriff's office said all 10 students were taken to the elementary school on a replacement bus. </p>
      <p>The students were evaluated by the nursing staff once they arrived at school, officials said. Some of the children reported experiencing some injuries consistent with bumps and scrapes.</p>
      <p>School staff contacted parents of the children and all students went to class after the nurse evaluation, the sheriff's office said. </p>
      <p>Weather and road conditions were a factor in the crash, according to the release.</p>
