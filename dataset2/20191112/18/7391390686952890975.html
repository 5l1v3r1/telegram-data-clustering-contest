      <p>Now that <i>The Mandalorian</i> is finally streaming on Disney+, <i>Star Wars </i>diehards may want to dive right in to the new addition to the expansive saga. But since it is part of a larger story, fans may want to watch the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/this-is-when-more-the-mandalorian-episodes-come-out-on-disney-19303503">movies and TV shows connected to <i>The Mandalorian</i></a> first, to get the whole narrative overview.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/everything-we-know-about-the-mandalorian">series takes place five years</a> after<i> Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</i>, per the official <i>Star Wars </i>site, and 25 years before J.J. Abrams's <i>Episode VII: The Force Awakens</i>, so those movies should take priority. However, since the Disney+ series revolves around Mandalorians, audiences may want to revisit the two most famous bounty hunters who have already been featured in the <a href="https://www.sideshow.com/geek/mandalorian-screen-history-of-boba-fett/"><i>Star Wars</i> series: Jango and Boba Fett</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/boba-fett">Boba Fett was first canonically introduced</a> in <i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i>, per Starwars.com, where he appeared as one of Jabba the Hutt's mercenaries. However, he played a more substantial part in the two following films — <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The bounty hunter was played by Mark Anthony Austin in the first film and Jeremy Bulloch in the following two, while <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast">Jason Wingreen voiced Boba Fett</a>. According to the <i>Star Wars</i> site, Bulloch got the part simply because <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-identities-jeremy-bulloch-interview">he fit the costume</a>. "[The armor] is not comfortable but you had to make it look as though it were, I suppose, using a bit of acting," Bulloch told the site. "It was ripping your skin apart, but you know the character. He's a bounty hunter and he's not going to say, 'I want a soft cushion.'"</p>
      <p>But while the Mandalorian armor may not have been comfortable, it contributed to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/11/8/20953924/star-wars-boba-fett-design-the-mandalorian">his reputation as a swashbuckling mercenary</a> with a devil-may-care attitude. Here's everything to watch before diving into the Disney+ show, which includes plenty of Boba Fett.</p>
      <h3>1. The Initial Boba Fett Screen Test</h3>
      <p>Star Wars on YouTube</p>
      <p>1978 marked the first screen test for Boba Fett, which featured <i>The Empire Strikes Back </i>assistant film editor Duwayne Dunham wearing the armor while the film's sound designer, Ben Burtt, narrated. The initial costume included a flame thrower, rifle, spiked boots, pistol, and a jet pack, among other features.</p>
      <p>"They wanted a character that could make public appearances, and I think Boba was kind of designed as a character between <i>Star Wars</i> [<i>Episode IV: A New Hope</i>] and <i>Empire </i>[<i>Strikes Back</i>] that they could get the public excited about," Burtt said in the above video.</p>
      <h3>2. 'The Star Wars Holiday Special'</h3>

      <p>Love the<i> Star Wars Holiday Special</i> or hate it, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/the-star-wars-holiday-special-boba-fett">Boba Fett was first introduced</a> in this <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2008/12/star_wars_special200812#~o">1978 made-for-TV special</a>, per the <i>Star Wars </i>site. The bounty hunter appeared during a ten-minute animated portion of the standalone special, which dictated Boba's base color — blue. "Costumes have to read against the background. Boba was mostly set against the darker range of the spectrum," the segment animator, John Celestri, told StarWars.com. "That means the character needs to be lighter. And the whole reason behind this was that at the time many families still had black-and-white televisions! We had to make sure that it read on the screen. The biggest TV screen in 1978 was 22 inches, diagonally."</p>

      <h3>3. 'Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones'</h3>

      <p>While the <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-prequels-worst-reviews-most-brutal/"><i>Star Wars </i>prequels are oft-derided</a> by fans and critics alike, there are still some important storylines that take place in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>. One such plot point is the introduction of <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/jango-fett">bounty hunter Jango Fett</a> — Boba Fett's father/clone, who is later killed by Mace Windu.</p>
      <p>There has been some contention on <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-boba-jango-fett-not-mandalorian/">whether Boba and Jango are bona fide Mandalorians</a> or not — whatever the case, they wear Mandalorian armor, and their mercenary profession is carried over in the new Disney+ series.</p>

      <h3>4. 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars'</h3>

The young clone first appears in Season 2, Episode 20, "Death Trap," the following three episodes. Boba also appears in Season 3, Episode 2, "ARC Troopers," and Season 4, Episode 15, "Deception," and Season 4, Episode 20, "Deception."</p>

      <p>Leia's Lair: A Star Wars Channel on YouTube</p>
      <p>This Han Solo origin story <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-boba-fett-movie-solo-cameo-theory/">features a brief Boba Fett cameo</a>, according to Screen Rant. The film follows the young rebel as he meets Chewbacca and finds his beloved Millennium Falcon, which Boba would eventually track down in <i>Episode V</i>.</p>

      <h3>6. 'Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'</h3>
      <p>starwars 2149 on YouTube</p>
      <p>Not only is there a body frozen in carbonite in <i>The Mandalorian</i> trailer, which is a reference to Han Solo's brief career as an ice cube, but Boba Fett gets plenty of screen time in <i>Episode V. </i>The film depicts Darth Vader hiring Boba and several other bounty hunters to capture the Millennium Falcon.</p>

      <h3>7. 'Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'</h3>
      <p>Voca Productions on YouTube</p>
      <p>Not only does <i>The Mandalorian</i> take place five years after <i>Episode VI</i>, so the movie is important to watch for continuity reasons, but audiences also see Boba Fett's hilariously lame death by virtue of the Sarlacc pit.</p>
