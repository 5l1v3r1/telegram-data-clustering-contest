      <h1>Victor Lindelof admits he "misses" former Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho signed Victor Lindelof for Manchester United from Benfica and helped him progress into a first team player before he was sacked in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:44:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Victor Lindelof says he misses former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho being in football, adding: "He's one of the world's best coaches".</p>
      <p>Mourinho signed Lindelof for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man United</a> from Benfica and helped him progress into a first team player before he was sacked and replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018.</p>
      <p>Since then Lindelof has nailed down a place in the Red Devils first team alongside £80million summer signing Harry Maguire.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, meanwhile, is yet to return to football management, despite confirming he has received a number of job offers.</p>
      <p>It seems the Portuguese, who has won trophies in four countries, is waiting for the right job, but Lindelof thinks it's a shame he's not currently managing.</p>

      <p>"He is, after all, one of the world's best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football," Lindelof told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/zGzjXr/lindelof-jag-ville-inte-visa-hur-orolig-jag-var">Aftonbladet.</a></p>
      <p>"He's a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything.</p>

      <p>"I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug.</p>
      <p>"Even if I did not agree, at the time… he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him. He's won everything. When he says something, you listen."</p>
