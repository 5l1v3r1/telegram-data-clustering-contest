      <p>Back in July, Weeks revealed that he’d been at work on his debut album for the past 18 months, while promising that it was “very nearly done”.</p>
      <p>“For me, holding my nerve has been a large part of finishing a record,” he said, “and there’s a certain confidence that comes from discovering a song can survive in a room full of strangers.</p>
      <p>“The flip side of that is that you unearth problems you wish had stayed buried. There’s every chance it won’t work, but that’s the gamble.”</p>
      <p>With new shows on the horizon, fans can expect to hear new material in the coming months.</p>
      <p>The Maccabees released four studio albums before parting ways back in 2015. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-maccabees-123-1196193">Announcing their split at the time</a>, the band assured fans that they would “continue making music” in other forms.</p>
