      <h1>Private equity firm Sanaka Capital to inject Rs 525 cr in Edelweiss Global</h1>
      <h2>Sanaka will initially invest Rs 308 crore, and a further Rs 217 crore on a later date if talks are successful</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:18:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author">Sundar Sethuraman</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/edelweiss">Edelweiss </a>group has secured another round of funding for its advisory business. On Tuesday, the company announced that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/private-equity">private equity </a>firm Sanaka Capital has committed to invest Rs 525 crore into <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/edelweiss">Edelweiss </a>Global Investment Advisors (EGIA).</p>
      <p>Sanaka Capital will initially invest Rs 308 crore in EGIA and a further Rs 217 crore on a later date if talks are successful.</p>
      <p>In August, US-based Kora Management had pumped in Rs 525 crore in EGIA. People in the know said Sanaka Capital’s investment would fetch less than 10 per cent stake in EGIA.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/edelweiss">Edelweiss </a>said these investment partnerships are part of the strategic growth plan, whereby the group will operate three separate businesses — credit, investment advisory, and insurance. The three will be distinct entities with “their own set of investors, ring-fenced capital base, and an independent board”, Edelweiss said in a release.</p>
      <p>The credit and life insurance businesses of Edelweiss, too, have got investors on board. Canada’s Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) has made a strategic investment of Rs 1,800 crore in the credit business, while Japan’s Tokio Marine has picked up a 49 per cent stake in the life insurance business.</p>
      <p>Wealth management and advisory are being looked at as business areas with high growth potential.</p>
      <p>In September, IIFL Wealth Management became the country’s first major private wealth manager to go for a listing, following its demerger from parent IIFL Finance. It is currently valued at Rs 11,000 crore.</p>
      <p>“Financial services in India has gained traction in recent years, thanks to a young workforce. We look forward to working with the Sanaka team,” said Rashesh Shah, chairman and CEO of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/edelweiss-group">Edelweiss group.</a></p>
      <p>“We are confident EGIA will capture growth opportunities through product expansion and entry into new regions,” said Shankar Narayanan, founder of Sanaka Group.</p>
