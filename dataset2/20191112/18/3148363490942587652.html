      <p>When her three-year-old chihuahua mix named Charlie went missing, Greg Corona <a href="https://q13fox.com/2019/11/12/family-tracks-down-missing-dog-eight-months-after-his-disappearance/">said</a> his young cousin’s heart was broken.</p>
      <p>“My cousin, it’s actually her dog, she was like sad about it and she thought it wasn’t going to return back,” he commented.</p>
      <p>The girl’s mother, Eva Delgado, told reporters that a neighbor saw Charlie months before and dropped him off at a local mechanic’s shop. But when the family went to get him, the shop owner denied ever having seen the dog.</p>
      <p>Last week, Delgado <a href="https://wgno.com/2019/11/12/family-tracks-down-missing-dog-eight-months-after-his-disappearance/">said</a> in Spanish that when she saw a woman walk in front of her house with a dog that looked just like Charlie, she went outside and called to him.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Charlie, come here.’ I said, ‘That’s mine,’ and she said, ‘No, it’s my dad’s,'” Delgado explained to reporters.</p>
      <p>She said the woman refused to hand Charlie over, so she followed her back to the same mechanic’s shop where the neighbor said he took Charlie.</p>
      <p>Delgado <a href="https://newsfeeds.media/family-reunited-with-stolen-dog-after-8-months-when-thief-walks-him-past-their-house/">confronted</a> the manager and said the dog belonged to her daughter, but he refused to give him up.</p>
      <p>“He says, ‘I don’t have the papers on me, I have them in my house.’ I said, ‘No, you can’t have them,'” she recalled, adding that his <a href="https://fox40.com/2019/11/11/patterson-family-tracks-down-missing-dog-8-months-after-his-disappearance/">story</a> kept changing as they argued.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think that’s like fair. It’s not your dog. You have no right to keep him if he has owners,” Corona said of the incident.</p>
      <p>However, Delgado had proof the dog belonged to their family because he was registered and microchipped.</p>
      <p>Once she contacted the police, Deputy Wilson, who is a Marine veteran, and another police officer located Charlie at a home in Modesto and scanned his microchip. In just one hour, he was back where he belongs with the Delgado family.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited to have him back after eight months,” Corona said. “Excited, happy. I’m pretty sure my cousin’s happy too,” he concluded.</p>
      <p>The Delgado family said they have yet to decide whether or not they will press charges against the individuals who stole Charlie.</p>
