      <h1>Pixel 4-series November security patch reportedly rolling out now</h1>
      <h2>That said, we haven't gotten the update yet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:40:21+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>Long has been the dark night of the Pixel 4’s lost November security update, but it seems as if the sun is finally rising on the unsecured Pixel serfs.</p>
      <p><i>Android Police </i>is now reporting that some unlocked Pixel 4 devices are beginning to get the November security update. Although, we haven’t been able to download it yet on our review units.</p>
      <p>Google has been cagey with<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/08/november-update-pixel-4-google-get-it-when-you-get-it/"> information on the update</a> telling users: “You’ll get it when you get it.”</p>
      <p>When the update does roll out, Pixel 4-series users can look forward to smooth display and camera improvements.</p>
