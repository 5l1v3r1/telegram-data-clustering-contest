      <h1>Arsenal's Kieran Tierney stance blasted as Barry Ferguson hits out at club for blocking Scotland return</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery refused to let Tierney join up with Steve Clark's side even though he’s playing regularly for the Gunners.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:11:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Former Scotland skipper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/barry-ferguson">Barry Ferguson</a> last night blasted Arsenal for blocking Kieran Tierney’s return to the international squad.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the latest episode of the must-listen <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/fergietime/75689907-0a77-417e-9e03-df01821ac2d9">Fergie Time podcast</a> , the <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>columnist defends the list of big named players who have withdrawn from Steve Clarke’s squad ahead of the final Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>But, while Ferguson is adamant Clarke’s top star are not conducting a dressing room rebellion against the manager, he has given both barrels to the Gunners for refusing to let £25million <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Tierney</a> out of their sights even though he’s now playing regularly for Unai Emery’s first team.</p>
      <p>Fergie said: “I think that’s out of order from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> . Tierney is one of the best players in the squad and I imagine he’d be a big character in the dressing room as well.</p>
      <p>“Watching him at Celtic he had his fist clenched and he got fired in about people. So you would want that in your squad. If I was the manager I’m like that, ‘No you get in here, even if you’re not going to play then be about the place!’.</p>
      <p>“But do the club’s control it now? Because I think he’d be the type of boy who would want to turn up. Would you not? From everything I’ve heard about Kieran Tierney he’d be straight up on a plane wanting to be involved. But Arsenal are obviously calling the shots.</p>
      <p>“Kieran Tierney would strike me as the type of person who would say, 'No, I want to go.’”</p>

      <p>Newcastle winger Matt Ritchie has become the latest in line of former key men to ask not to be considered for selection.</p>
      <p>Ritchie’s decision to retire comes as Clarke attempts to cope with the losses of Tierney, Liverpool skipper Andy Robertson, Bournemouth talisman <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Ryan Fraser</a> and Leeds stopper Liam Cooper. Lewis Morgan was drafted in from the fringes of Celtic’s first team squad yesterday along with Derby’s Graeme Shinnie.</p>
      <p>But, in a heated debate, Ferguson refused to accept that some of Clarke’s players may have lost their appetite for the national cause.</p>
      <p>He went on: “This is the two games you should want to turn up for because Scotland should be beating Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>“So if these guys aren’t turning up then they must be injured because six points are a given. If players are not turning up because they don’t want to play for Scotland then that’s another thing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But I believe these guys are injured otherwise they’d want to be there.</p>
      <p>“See when I was in Scotland squads when we were wining games, whether that was under Walter Smith or Alex McLeish, during my most successful time with Scotland when we were getting to play-offs, I was still bored turning up because I knew what was going to happen.</p>
      <p>“I enjoyed training but it was the bit outside of training that was difficult. I was buzzing for playing against Italy or in big games at Hampden but it was the bits in between training that were the difficult bits for any international manager.</p>
      <p>“So if people are now saying it’s boring (to be part of the Scotland squad) then it’s been boring for the last 100 years!”</p>
