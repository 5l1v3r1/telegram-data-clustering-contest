      <h1>‘Clearly angling for the job’: Former GOP strategist says Haley is trying to get Trump to 'dump' Pence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:04:28+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>Former Republican strategist Steve Schimdt claimed Nikki Haley is trying to nudge President Trump toward ditching Mike Pence as vice president and letting her take his place.</p>
      <p>Since leaving her post as United Nations ambassador, Haley has defended Trump and touted her loyalty to the president. In her new book, <i>With All Due Respect</i>, Haley <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/it-was-offensive-nikki-haley-claims-john-kelly-and-rex-tillerson-had-a-sidebar-plan-to-undermine-trump">detailed an exchange</a> in which she stood by the president when Rex Tillerson and John Kelly urged her to turn against him.</p>
      <p>During a Tuesday appearance on <i>Morning Joe</i>, Schmidt doubted the credibility of her claim, arguing it is part of a larger attempt to land on Trump’s 2020 ticket.</p>
      <p>"I find her statements on this not particularly credible,” Schimdt said. “I think they speak to her ambition, and I think Mike Pence is probably hanging out back there, thinking, 'Hey, I got a 1 in 365 chance in picking the day that Trump’s going to dump me from the ticket and put her on sometime in the next year.'"</p>

      <p>Schmidt, who worked on campaigns for George W. Bush and John McCain, said that Haley is “currying favor” with Trump by criticizing Tillerson and Kelly. He predicted there is an “overwhelming” chance that Pence is dropped in favor of someone who can bolster Trump’s electability with female voters.</p>
      <p>“He has an enormous problem with women, suburban women particularly. He’s entirely transactional; loyalty is a one-way street,” he said, adding, “She’s clearly angling for the job, and when you look at the politics of it, she would serve his immediate political interests in a way that Pence can’t.”</p>
      <p>Schimdt added that he believes Haley’s book tour is an effort to build herself up and make the move when the president is ready.</p>
      <p>Haley, 47, criticized Trump in the 2016 election while supporting Marco Rubio’s failed bid. Her tone changed when she was offered the position of U.N. ambassador.</p>
