      <h1>Avengers: Endgame deleted scene on Disney+ shows Tony's daughter all grown up</h1>
      <h2>If somehow you are still yet to see Avengers: Endgame then you might not want to read on as there are spoilers for the end of the movie ahead</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:16:56+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>Before <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/avengers-endgame">Avengers: Endgame</a> hit cinema screens back in April, it was widely teased that 13 Reasons Why star Katherine Langford had a secret role in the blockbuster.</p>
      <p>But when the movie was released, the actress was nowhere to be seen.</p>
      <p>Directors Joe and Anthony Russo ultimately decided to cut her scene from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/marvel-comics">Marvel</a> movie, disappointing many fans.</p>
      <p>Now Avengers fans have finally had the chance to see her big moment as the deleted scene has been added to the film's "Extras" section on Disney+.</p>

      <p>Disney's new streaming platform launched in the US today and fans were thrilled to discover the cut scene nestled among its content.</p>
      <p>In it Langford stars as a grown up version of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-stark">Tony Stark</a> (Robert Downey Jr.) and Pepper Potts' (Gwyneth Paltrow) daughter, Morgan.</p>
      <p>After Tony snaps his fingers, removing Thanos from existence, he is sent to 'The Way Station', where he questions whether or not he made the right choice.</p>
      <p>There he meets his adult daughter and she tells him that she's lived a happy life - and it's all thanks to him.</p>
      <p>The scene ends on an emotional note, as Tony accepts his fate and whispers in Morgan's ear, "I love you 3,000".</p>

      <p>Sadly, Disney+ won't be available in the UK until March 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/12/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-katherine-langford-tony-stark-daughter/?utm_term=DCED4300-056F-11EA-B784-56F04744363C&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=link">Entertainment Weekly</a> has seen the deleted clip and revealed what <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-russo">Joe Russo</a> had to say about it in the commentary.</p>
      <p>"This is originally what happened after Tony snapped his fingers," he explains. "We sent him to what we would call 'The Way Station' to mirror what happened with Thanos with his daughter in Infinity War."</p>
      <p>He adds that the idea of the scene was so "Tony could come to peace with what he's just done. [His daughter] tells him everything is gonna be okay and allows him to die."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a different interview the Russo brothers also stated that they didn't feel there was enough of an "emotional connection" to adult Morgan, as she hadn't been in any of the other films.</p>
      <p>Despite this, fans on social media said they had been moved to tears by the deleted scene.</p>
      <p>One person tweeted: "I'm crying."</p>
      <p>Another wrote that it had made their "heart hurt".</p>
      <p>Others began making jokes in reference to Langford's 13 Reasons Why character, Hannah Baker.</p>
      <p>"It's Morgan Stark. Live and in stereo. If you're listening to this tape you're one of the reasons why. (Tape 14: Tony Stark)," quipped a different user.</p>
