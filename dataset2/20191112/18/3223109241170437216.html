      <h1>‘Star Wars: A New Hope’ Has Hilarious New Han/Greedo Edit on Disney+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:46:05+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>At this point the rich history and mythology of Star Wars as a brand is bigger, stronger, and more important than any of the individual movies. These are stories about sacred texts that have since become sacred texts themselves. And along with lightsabers and X-wings, a key part of Star Wars fan lore also revolves around being angry at George Lucas for continuing to mess around with those sacred texts.</p>
      <p>Well joke’s on you, dorks. Continuing to prove that he is in fact <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/george-lucas-is-cooler-than-star-wars-1698446/">cooler than any of his creations</a>, George Lucas apparently did one last hilarious bit of editing to <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>. For years folks whined that space outlaw Han Solo got prematurely neutered when a new edit no longer had him firing first but second and in self-defense. However, on Disney+ (if you can even <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/disney-experiences-connection-issues-on-launch-day-1810197/">get it to work</a>) Han still doesn’t shoot first. And now Greedo gets the last inexplicable word.</p>

      <p>Maclunkey! Oh my god, that’s so funny. I really thought we hit peak ironic Star Wars editing in 2011 with Obi-Wan’s whooping dragon call and Darth Vader shouting “No!” when tossing Sheev down the drain. But now on this <a href="https://www.geek.com/geek-pick/cut-the-cord-and-subscribe-to-these-streaming-tv-services-1704574/">streaming TV service</a> we finally get to see this weird green monster shout some pointless gibberish before Harrison Ford murders him. That’s already worth the $7 per month as far as I’m concerned.</p>

      <p>And even better<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit"> Vanity Fair</a> reports that this final change did in fact come from George Lucas before he sold Star Wars to Disney. Considering how many millions of people are trying out Disney + right now, surely we would know about any other changes by now. But I’m holding out hope there’s a secret extra 4K HDR scene of Emperor Sheev Palpatine saying his full name out loud. Or maybe they’re saving that for<i> The Rise of Skywalker.</i></p>
