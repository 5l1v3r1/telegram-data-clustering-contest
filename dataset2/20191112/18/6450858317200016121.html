      <h1>The best VPN for Disney Plus</h1>
      <h2>Our pick of the top six VPN providers if you're looking to appear in the US, Canada or The Netherlands - currently the only countries where it's available</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:07:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author">Anyron Copeman</a></address>
      <p>The highly anticipated streaming service Disney+ is out now in the US, Canada and The Netherlands, but not elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Unlike <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777662-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Finternet%2Fbest-vpn-disney-plus-3777662%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fapple%2Fwhats-on-apple-tv-3694177%2F">Apple TV+</a>, Disney has a huge library of content from launch. Most of the recent Marvel films are here, alongside old classics such as Hannah Montana and even the full Simpsons collection. Add eagerly awaited original content such as <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-the-mandalorian-uk-3777629/">The Mandalorian</a> or <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/falcon-winter-soldier-3776189/">Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a> and it becomes a compelling package.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/disney-plus-3695971/">UK release date</a> has been confirmed for <b>31 March 2020</b>, meaning we have months to wait to watch the new shows.</p>
      <p>While it's disappointing that we'll have to wait more than four months for access to the same content, there are potential ways to get around this. A virtual private network (VPN) gives you an IP address from a country that you select. With some, you can even have more granular control over a specific region.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, a VPN isn't enough - signing up for Disney+ also requires a payment method from the appropriate country, though we've found (and tested) a sneaky workaround using a US Apple ID and some digital gift cards. For more info, read our detailed guide on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">how to watch Disney Plus in the UK</a>.</p>

      <h3>Best VPN for Disney+</h3>
      <anchor name="toc-3777662-1">
        <h4>NordVPN</h4>

        <ul>
          <li><b>RRP: </b>From £2.82 per month</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NordVPN still takes the top spot in our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/best-vpn-reviews-3657732/">best VPN chart</a>, despite a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/vpn/is-it-safe-use-nordvpn-3776450/">security breach</a> being revealed recently. </p>
        <p>If you're dealing with highly sensitive online information we wouldn't recommend Nord, but it's still safe to use for location-restricted content. </p>
        <p>It's our favourite service from a usability standpoint, with great speed and a number of premium features at an affordable price. You can appear in 62 countries in total, including the US, Canada and The Netherlands. </p>
        <p>It's available for as little as £2.82 per month if you sign up for the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777662-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Finternet%2Fbest-vpn-disney-plus-3777662%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com%2Fspecial%2Fdark-single%2F">three-year deal</a>, but there's plenty of flexibility with two-year, one-year, six-month and one-month plans also available. </p>

          <h4>ExpressVPN</h4>

          <ul>
            <li><b>RRP: </b>From $6.67 per month (around £5.05)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the recent news has completely put you off Nord, then ExpressVPN is a great alternative.</p>
          <p>It is more expensive than many rivals, but with thousands of servers and great customer support it's easy to recommend. The unrestricted access will give you the opportunity to connect to servers in all countries as the service is launched there. </p>
          <p>You data is safe as the company doesn't keep any logs, while there's a kill switch should your connection ever drop.</p>
          <p>There is currently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777662-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Finternet%2Fbest-vpn-disney-plus-3777662%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Forder">a deal that offers 15 months for the price of 12</a>, though, and there’s a 30-day money-back guarantee available.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>RRP: </b>From $3.33 per month (around £2.60)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PureVPN claims to be the world's fastest. It offers one of the most complete VPN services on the market, with more than 200 servers in 140 countries. These include all the countries that will be getting Disney+ before the UK. </p>
            <p>At the time of writing, an early Black Friday deal makes the three-year plan just <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/internet/vpn-deals-3667656/">US$1.92 per month</a> (approx £1.50). For two years, it only jumps up to <a href="https://www.purevpn.com/best-vpn-deal&amp;data1=06-3777662-11-0000000">US$2.46</a> per month.</p>

                <li><b>RRP: </b>From $2.75 (around £2.10) per month</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The beauty of CyberGhost lies in its flexibility, with the service available across multiple platforms and as a browser extension. </p>
              <p>If you're new to VPNs, this is a great one to get started with, with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. </p>
              <p>All the features you'd expect from a modern VPN are here, including up to seven simultaneous connections, mobile apps and a built-in kill switch.  </p>
              <p>The pricing is competitive, too, with a three-year deal just £2.10/US$2.75 per month.</p>
              <p>Sign up for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777662-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Ftest-centre%2Finternet%2Fbest-vpn-disney-plus-3777662%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Foffer%2Fidg_s3prstzoc">CyberGhost on its website</a>.</p>

                  <li><b>RRP: </b>From £1.59 per month</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Surfshark's VPN is incredibly easy to set up and get started with. Countries including the US have multiple servers available direct in the application, and it should work with all major streaming services. </p>
                <p>There's a MultiHop feature for added privacy, as well as an ad-blocker tool built-in. The implementations within browsers, on mobile and via desktop are all similarly easy to use and effective. </p>
                <p>Starting at £1.59/US$1.99 per month, it's one of the cheapest VPNs around. See all of the price plans <a href="https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=6&amp;aff_id=1351&amp;aff_sub=06-3777662-11-0000000">on the Surfshark website</a>.</p>

                  <h4>TunnelBear</h4>

                    <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3777662/tunnelbear_thumb800.jpg"/>

                    <li><b>RRP: </b>From £3.33 per month</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Although its unusual design may take a little while to get used to, TunnelBear's VPN is incredibly simple and stripped back, offering only the services you really need. </p>
                  <p>The company is based in Canada, one of the launch destinations, so should be optimised for appearing in North America. There's no choice of server among the 22 countries offered, but for a streaming service</p>
                  <p>Do note that it doesn't work with BBC iPlayer, so look at <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/best-vpn-for-bbc-iplayer-3673782/">other options</a> if you want to be covered for the BBC's catch-up service abroad. </p>
                  <p>It's great to see a free tier, but with a limit of 500MB per month you'll almost certainly want to upgrade to unlimited data. This starts at £3.33 per month on the two-year plan. </p>
