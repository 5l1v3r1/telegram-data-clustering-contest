      <p>A public inquiry will be held into the death of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sheku-bayoh">Sheku Bayoh</a> who died after being restrained by police officers.</p>
      <p>The Scottish government announced an “independent and robust” inquiry would examine the circumstances around the tragedy.</p>
      <p>The move was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/family-sheku-bayoh-feel-totally-20860410">welcomed by Sheku’s family</a> who have campaigned for answers for more than four years.</p>
      <p>Sheku’s mother Aminata Bayoh earlier met with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf at the Scottish Parliament.</p>
      <p>She watched from the public gallery of the debating chamber as Yousaf revealed the inquiry would include probing whether race played a part in Sheku’s death.</p>

      <p>Sheku, 32, died in May 2015 after being restrained by up to nine cops near his Kirkcaldy home.</p>
      <p>The gas engineer, who had taken the drugs MDMA and Flakka, was found to have suffered 23 separate injuries.</p>
      <p>On Monday his family members spoke of feeling “totally betrayed” after meeting Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC to be told criminal charges wouldn’t be pursued against any police officers.</p>
      <p>Sheku’s mum Aminata, 70, said yesterday: “It’s been really hard for us but we need justice for my son.”</p>
      <p>Kadi Johnson, Sheku’s sister, said: “We want this inquiry to mean something and Sheku’s death not to have been in vain.</p>
      <p>“His name has been tarnished in the past four years. This is about achieving justice for Sheku and for a fairer Scotland for all irrespective of race and background.”</p>

      <p>The Bayoh family’s solicitor Aamer Anwar said the “setting up of a public inquiry is a critical moment for Scottish justice, the rule of law and important step forward in the family’s campaign to establish accountability”.</p>
      <p>He added: “This is an important first step in holding power to account and establishing the truth, because without truth there can be no justice.”</p>
      <p>Following her meeting with the family, the First Minister said: “My message to his family today, as well as repeating my deep condolences for their loss and what they’ve suffered over these past few years, is that they have a right to the answers to the questions that they have.</p>
      <p>“I hope that a full public inquiry can deliver those answers and also tell us if there are any lessons that require to be learned from what is undoubtedly a tragic case.”</p>
      <p>Yousaf said: “It is imperative that the circumstances leading up to Mr Bayoh’s death and the events that followed, including whether race played a part, are examined in full and in public.”</p>
      <p>The justice secretary said the Lord Advocate had identified questions about the early stages of the police’s post-incident management of the investigation which couldn’t be examined in a fatal accident inquiry.</p>
      <p>A statement on the choice of chairman of the inquiry, along with its terms of reference, is expected early in the new year.</p>

      <p>James Kelly MSP, Labour’s justice spokesman, said: “It is shocking in modern Scotland the circumstances in which Mr Bayoh has lost his life and it is unacceptable nobody has been held legally responsible.”</p>
      <p>He “strongly supported” the public inquiry, but asked whether it would scrutinise “recent cases and review the protocol the Lord Advocate follows when reaching a decision for non-prosecution or granting immunity”.</p>
      <p>Last December evidence uncovered by BBC Scotland raised fresh questions about the way that officers treated Sheku before he died in their custody.</p>
      <p>CCTV and documents casted doubt on some of the officers’ accounts.</p>
