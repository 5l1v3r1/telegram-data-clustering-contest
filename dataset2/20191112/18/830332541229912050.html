      <p>GREEN BAY, Wis. - The Green Bay Packers say Zeke Bratkowski, the quarterback who backed up Bart Starr during the team's 1960s dynasty, has died at his Florida home. He was 88.</p>
      <p>The Packers Hall of Famer was a quarterback in Green Bay from 1963-1968 and again in 1971.</p>

      <p>One of Bratkowski's most notable performances in relief of an injured Starr came in 1965, a 13-10 overtime playoff win over the Baltimore Colts that sent the Packers to the title game against Cleveland.</p>
      <p>They beat the Browns for what would be the first of three straight championship seasons, and Bratkowski played briefly in both Super Bowl wins in the two years that followed.</p>
      <p>Bratkowski was a star at the University of Georgia before starting his career with the Chicago Bears.</p>
