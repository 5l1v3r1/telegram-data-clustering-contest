      <p>The Glamour Boys go into the international break 10 points clear at the top of the Absa Premiership table following their late 3-2 win over the Buccaneers last weekend, and their coach is delighted with the collective effort from his team as they marched on to continue their fine form. </p>
      <p>Chiefs have chopped and changed their team quite heavily this season as Middendorp looks to work his way around injuries and manage the fitness of his players, and he has compared Liverpool’s 3-0 win over Manchester City to their triumph at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon. </p>
      <p>Speaking to the club’s official website as Chiefs go into the break, the German said, “The individual performance of Pirates players is great… Ours was collective energy and effort. And that is what made the results. Liverpool beat City through collective team effort on Sunday. It’s a normal way in a Derby. Pirates had a team of individual quality. They could match us on quality, but we had upper hand on the teamwork.” </p>

      <p>Now Middendorp can turn his attention away from the Buccaneers after two derbies in quick succession and instead focus on his former club, Maritzburg United, as he looks to navigate a way past the Team of Choice in order to book their place in this year’s Telkom Knockout final.  </p>
