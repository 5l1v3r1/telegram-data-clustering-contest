      <h1>On Disney+’s Version of <i>Star Wars</i>, Greedo Says ‘Maclunkey!’ First</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:14:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jackson McHenry</a></address>
      <p>Anyone who can navigate through the mire of technical glitches that have plagued <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/disney-plus-streaming-strategy.html">the launch of Disney+</a> has a whole lot of <i>Star Wars</i> surprises waiting for them. Not just the first episode of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-mandalorian-star-wars-disney-plus-review.html"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> but apparently a new version of <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, in which Greedo and Han Solo’s infamous shootout in the Mos Eisley cantina has been changed yet again.</p>
      <p>In the original version of the movie, and the one fans generally prefer, Han shoots the bounty hunter Greedo at point-blank range after a few threats but not a ton of other provocation. (Is he justified? That’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/han-solo-legally-justified-shooting-greedo-first.html">a subject for the legal experts</a>.) In 1997, Lucas changed the scene so that Greedo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpXD2tvV-9Q">shoots first</a>, and he changed it again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv3t0Be3aHc">in 2004</a>, so that they shoot at each other almost simultaneously, with Greedo firing a little before. The version currently available for streaming, as a Vulture staffer checked and confirmed, still has Greedo and Han shooting each other at nearly the same time but not until after Greedo shouts a phrase that sounds like “Maclunkey!”</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/disney-plus-movies-shows-include-deals-cost.html">Disney+</a> subscribers on Twitter have already noticed the new, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericfell/status/1194180485129199619">Maclunkey-added version of the original film</a> and reacted with the appropriate levels of intense confusion. According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>, Lucas himself made the change to <i>A New Hope </i>before selling the <i>Star Wars </i>films to Disney in 2012, though that still doesn’t explain Greedo’s weird exclamation. What does “Maclunkey” mean? Why does it sound like the last name of a football star from a Wisconsin high school? Is this some secret deep-lore Easter egg? (The fan database Wookieepedia has not helped us here.) Was Maclunkey Rey’s mom or dad? Millions of voices suddenly cried out “Maclunkey!” in unison, and so far have gotten no reply.</p>
