      <h1>Patrick Vieira explains why Granit Xhaka deserves respect from Arsenal fans</h1>
      <h2>The Swiss midfielder has been the subject of derision from Gunners supporters since he swore at them while being substituted against Crystal Palace last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:01:43+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira believes midfielder Granit Xhaka has been treated harshly by supporters of the club and has urged them to show the Swiss international more respect.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenals-granit-xhaka-house-hunting-20868561">Xhaka's future in north London looks uncertain</a> after he swore at fans while leaving the pitch as he was substituted in Arsenal's 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>Since then he has been stripped of the captaincy and hasn't featured for the Gunners, with rumours he could be set for a January transfer.</p>
      <p>But Vieira, who is now manager of Ligue 1 side Nice, has sympathy for Xhaka's situation.</p>
      <p>"I feel sorry for him because he's going through a really different period and really difficult time at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> ," Vieira said. "But I think we have to remind ourselves that he's achieved a lot since he's (been) at Arsenal and he deserves a lot of respect.</p>

      <p>"When you're a player and don't perform the way you expect, you get frustrated about yourself. And sometimes you say things or do things you regret.</p>
      <p>"I find it really difficult a lot of ex-footballers have jumped on him and being really negative towards him - it's too too easy.</p>
      <p>"I know how good he is and he will come through this difficult period because he's a strong man, he's a good player. And he will show how good he is.''</p>
      <p>Vieira is impressing at Nice, who are currently 13th in Ligue 1, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/patrick-vieira-gives-verdict-unai-20866624">has been linked with a return to Arsenal</a> to replace the struggling Unai Emery as manager.</p>

      <p>But when asked about the rumours he said: "If it’s my dream to coach Arsenal or France? Yes, like any player, when we do this job we want to touch the very high level.</p>
      <p>"But the very high level I can touch with Nice from the moment we give ourselves the means to succeed and from the moment the way which we work is quite consistent.</p>
      <p>"But we do this job, and I do this job, to one day to be the coach of a team that participates in the Champions League.”</p>
