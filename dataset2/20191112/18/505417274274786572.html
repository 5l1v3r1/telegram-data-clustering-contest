        <b>Stephen Kenny has confirmed there will be four new faces in the Ireland U21 line-up for Thursday’s clash with Armenia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Due to unforeseen circumstances, Caoimhin Kelleher, Michael Obafemi, Conor Masterson, Neil Farrugia and Trevor Clarke pulled out of the squad through injury while both Jayson Molumby and Lee O’Connor are suspended.</p>
      <p>Speaking to FAI TV earlier today, Kenny confirmed that <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/gavin-bazunu-named-on-manchester-city-bench-for-first-time/">Gavin Bazunu</a>, the 17-year-old former Shamrock Rovers, now Man City goalkeeper, will get the nod in goal. Meanwhile, Nathan Collins, who has captained Stoke City on occasions this season is set to get a run at centre-back.</p>
      <p>Thomas O’Connor, who is currently on loan at Gillingham from Southampton, and Danny McNamara, on loan at Newport from Millwall, will also make their first appearances.</p>

      <p>Ireland will be looking to get back to winning ways in what has been an impressive campaign under Kenny so far, despite losing their last match 1-0 to Iceland.</p>
      <p>“It is a fantastic opportunity for the players coming in. They’re a fantastic group of players who all want to represent their country,”<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1_rUrqjUYo"> Kenny told FAI TV</a>.</p>
      <p>“We played extremely well against Armenia in Tallaght [and won 1-0], but Armenia will be a different proposition out here and they had a fantastic victory over Luxembourg in the last round of games.</p>
      <p>“We’re going into the game with the aim to win, these are our 11th and 12th matches of the year and we want to end this year on a high.”</p>
      <p>Thursday’s match will kick-off at 12pm Irish time.</p>
