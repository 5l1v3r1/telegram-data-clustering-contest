      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Federal cabinet on Tuesday likely to conditionally approve removal of former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL).</p>
      <p>Sources said that the former prime minister will have to provide guarantee to travel abroad. The federal cabinet is considering the option of submitting security bonds.</p>
      <p>Sources said that Nawaz Sharif’s name would be removed from the ECL if he fulfills the conditions of the Sub-Committee.</p>
      <p>The sub-committee has also demanded the lawyers of the PML-N supremo to handover some assets.</p>
      <p>The subcommittee will send a summary to the federal cabinet after approval of conditions from Nawaz Sharif. The sub-committee is scheduled to meet again today at 9:30pm in which the committee will officially announce its decision.</p>
      <p>The cabinet s sub-committee decided that Nawaz Sharif will have to submit a surety amount equal to the penalty imposed on him in Al-Azizia Reference.</p>
      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that two meetings of the subcommittee ended without any decision.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said the government itself should look into the matter of excluding Nawaz Sharif’s name from the ECL. The anti-graft watchdog had returned the matter to the interior ministry after it sent the PML-N supreme leader’s medical reports to the NAB.</p>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif was scheduled to travel UK on Qatar Airways flight QR629 yesterday. However, his ticket had been canceled as the authorities did not remove his name from the ECL.</p>
