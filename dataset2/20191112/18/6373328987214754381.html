        <b>Brad Pitt and Adam Sadler are both hugely successful actors, and good friends, yet they’ve never actually appeared in a movie together.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But, they <i>almost</i> did.</p>
      <p>According to reports, <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/adam-sandler-helps-raise-15k-in-honour-of-grown-ups-co-star-cameron-boyce/">Sandler</a> was the original choice to play the Bear Jew in <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/quentin-tarantino-refuses-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-china-cut/">Quentin Tarantino’s</a> <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>, but he couldn’t fulfil the role because he was too busy filming <i>Funny People</i>, so the role was instead handed to Eli Roth.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this topic didn’t come up during <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/brad-pitt-adam-sandler-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-uncut-gems-1203400765/"><i>Variety’s</i></a> ‘Actors On Actors’ series. However, we did learn Brad Pitt’s favourite Sandman story, and it includes some terrible, yet hilarious, advice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Referring to the director of <i>Capote</i> and <i>Moneyball</i>, Pitt told Sandler,:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>This is my favourite Adam Sandler story that I heard from Bennett Miller.<br/><br/>It was that you were at NYU, and it was an acting coach, I believe.</blockquote>
      <p>Correcting him, Sandler said: ‘Acting professor.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pitt added:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>And he said to you, ‘I want to take you out for a beer.’ This is what I’m told. You guys went to a bar, and he kindly said to you: ‘Think about something else. You have to choose another path.’ Truth?</blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>After Sandler confirmed this was the ‘truth’, Pitt continued:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>There’s a second part to this story. This is why it’s my favourite Adam Sandler story, and I think it says a lot about you. That you ran into him at your height, when you’re getting the ultimate payday, and you’re with a bunch of friends, out at a bar.<br/><br/>Anyone would think that’s the opportunity where you rub it in his face. And reportedly, what you did was you introduced him to your friends, and you said: ‘This is the only teacher to ever buy me a beer.’ True?</blockquote>
      <p>Sandler chose not to taunt his fellow actor in return, however it could be that he’s waiting until February, when he’s tipped to win Best Actor at the Oscars.</p>
      <p>Hey, at least we’ve all got a new Adam Sandler story to tell.</p>
