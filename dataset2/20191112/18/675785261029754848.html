      <p>England fans have demanded that the cap <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bobby-moore">Bobby Moore</a> won when he first skippered his country should be saved for the nation.</p>
      <p>They were speaking after it emerged that the 1966 World Cup hero’s cap was being auctioned later this month.</p>
      <p>Some demanded that the FA step in to buy it and donate it to a museum.</p>
      <p>It is expected to sell for £10,000.</p>
      <p>The World Cup hero’s relatives have decided to auction the historic blue velvet cap as England prepare for their historic 1,000th game.</p>
      <p>The symbolic item was presented to the late 1966 captain following England’s 4-2 victory over Czechoslovakia in 1963.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> season ticket holder Terry Trundle, 56, said: “Bobby Moore’s first cap as England captain should be a national treasure.</p>
      <p>“His cap should be put on display where football fans can see it.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice if the FA would step in and buy it for all England fans.”</p>
      <p>Birmingham City supporter Chris Collins, 53, said: “It would be a travesty if the cap went into private hands and left the country.</p>
      <p>“£10,000 is nothing in football these days the FA should buy it.”</p>
      <p>Moore died back in 1993 shunned by the game he loved and having to work for Capital Radio and the Sunday Sport.</p>

      <p>He could only dream of earning the wages of the modern player with current England stars earning more in one week than Moore did in his whole career.</p>
      <p>The National Football Museum told the Mirror they would love to put the cap on display if a wealthy benefactor wanted to buy it and loan it to them.</p>
      <p>Philippa Duxbury said: “We would of course be interested in displaying it as part of the England Story at the museum, should the eventual buyer wish to discuss this with us.”</p>
      <p>The other two caps to be sold are valued at £6,000 each were for Moore’s appearances against Portugal in 1964 and Yugoslavia in 1972.</p>

      <p>The auctioneers are expecting a huge amount of interest in the sale on November 20th.</p>
      <p>Ben Jones, a specialist at Mullock’s, said: “Bobby Moore is one of the most iconic names in English footballing history, even more so that it was his first international appearance as England captain.</p>
      <p>“All the caps are in very good condition and appear to have been kept dry and out of the light.”</p>
      <p>In the build up to the sale England will be playing their 1000th international match against Montenegro on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Mr Jones added: “We have had interest and the fact that England’s 1000th International match is approaching is beneficial.”</p>
