      </p>
      <p>Terabyte microSD cards, incredible though they are, are still wildly expensive. For us mere mortals, the next best thing — 512 gigabytes — is much more attainable. That's especially true today: you can snap up a 512-gig card for just 80 bucks from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B07SC7BZHR?tag=androidpolice-20">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1466565-REG/sandisk_sdsquar_512g_gn6ma_ultra_512gb_microsd_card.html/BI/19931/KBID/13015">B&amp;H</a>.</p>
      <p>If you're trying to decipher those hieroglyphics on the card's face, let me make things a little simpler: SanDisk's <i>Ultra</i> cards aren't as fast as its <i>Extreme</i> ones, but they're plenty quick enough for most tasks, with read speeds up to 100 megabytes per second and a minimum write speed of 10 megabytes per second.</p>

      <p>While it's not as impressive a bargain, the 256-gigabyte version is down in price too: it's only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0758NHWS8?tag=androidpolice-20">thirty bucks today on Amazon</a>. If you're in need of the storage, though, shake a leg. The deals on both the 256- and 512-gig expire at midnight Pacific time on Amazon. B&amp;H's deal ends even sooner, at 9 p.m. Pacific.</p>

        <p>If you're kicking yourself for missing this price the first time (or you could use a second giant memory card, you digital hoarder), you're in luck: 512-gig the SanDisk Ultra is back down to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SC7BZHR?tag=androidpolice-20">$80 on Amazon today</a>.
