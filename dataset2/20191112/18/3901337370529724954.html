      <p>Having spent some time abroad since his move to Montpellier a couple of years ago, Keagan Dolly has since settled down in France and has done so in comfort. Check it out!</p>
      <p>The Bafana Bafana star has slowly but surely familiarised himself in France's top flight, and appears to be living a comfortable life in the country.</p>

      <p>Dolly has frequently showed his adoring fans glimpses of how he has been keeping abroad, and often uploads images of himself and his partner at his crib to his social media pages.</p>
      <p>Judging by some of the images on his Instagram account, Dolly opted for a sleek and almost understated modernised living space. Equipped with a pool, the ex-Ajax Cape Town man seemingly made sure he kept in touch with his South African roots as a braai area can be seen in his backyard.</p>
      <p>With it being unclear as to whether or not he still resides in this particular home, it can be said that Dolly is living quite comfortably in France.</p>
