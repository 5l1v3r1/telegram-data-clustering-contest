      <p>If you've held off buying a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">new gaming laptop</a> but don't want to wait another minute, good news—you can score an Alienware M15 with a fast processor and one of Nvidia's newest generation Turing GPUs for $1,126.99, which is $550 below the list price. You just need to input coupon code <b>AW15550AFF</b> to get the hefty discount.</p>
      <p>This one comes configured with a 9th generation Intel Core i7-9750H processor, which is a 6-core/12-thread CPU with a 2.6GHz base clock, 4.5GHz max boost frequency, and 12MB of L3 cache. It's flanked by a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB GDDR6) and 16GB (2x8GB) of DDR4-2666 memory.</p>
      <p>For storage duties, this config pairs a 256GB M.2 NVMe SSD with a 1TB hybrid HDD (8GB of NAND flash memory to speed things up).</p>
      <p>Granted, we have seen other laptop deals featuring the same GPU for less money—specifically, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/save-dollar500-on-this-lenovo-legion-laptop-at-walmart-today-and-beat-the-black-friday-rush/">Lenovo's Legion Y540</a> stands out as a good bargain. What you get here, however, is a burlier CPU and a faster 144Hz refresh rate, wrapped in an Alienware aesthetic.</p>
      <p>As a reminder, we'll be highlighting <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> as they come into view, and are expecting a wide assortment of bargains. So, stay tuned!</p>
