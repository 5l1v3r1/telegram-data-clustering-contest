      <h1>Twitch Studio, the company’s streaming software for new users, is now in open beta</h1>
      <h2>The streaming site’s first software product is now available to everyone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:52:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/bijan-stephen" target="_blank">Bijan Stephen</a></address>
      <p>Twitch Studio — the broadcasting software the live-streaming site <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791437/twitch-studio-broadcasting-software-live-streaming">debuted</a> back in August to a select group of users — is now open to the public. (Though it is, for the moment, PC-only.) Developed as an easier way to stream and aimed at users who are just starting out on Twitch, the software is both functional <i>and</i> aesthetically appealing. It’s for people who have a vague desire to broadcast themselves to the internet but aren’t quite sure how to get started.</p>
      <p>Live-streaming is technically quite difficult: it’s live video production, which requires an understanding of the occasionally arcane ecosystem of software and plugins that make it possible. Like every other technologically difficult thing, it also requires a willingness to read a ton of forum comments in search of answers to troubleshoot whatever weird issue you’re having.</p>
      <p>Twitch Studio is designed to get rid of all that. It’s made to automatically detect things like your camera, microphone, and monitor resolution, and it comes with a host of templates and alerts that’ll help you seem professional, even if you’re not quite sure yet what you’re doing. That’s great because faking it till you make it is a timeworn strategy for a reason: it works. If you’re a Windows user, you can download the beta <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio">here</a>.</p>
