      <h1>Couple win Euromillions same day wife gets all-clear after breast cancer diagnosis</h1>
      <h2>Lynne and David Price, from New Tredegar, Wales, are the latest lucky Euromillions millionaires to scoop the National Lottery prize draw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:08:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>A great outdoors lover who has become the latest Euromillions millionaire says it wasn't even the best news he received that day.</p>
      <p>Welsh winner David Price will use part of the 'gobsmacked' couple's windfall to achieve his dream of a trek to Mt Everest's base camp.</p>
      <p>But despite becoming an overnight millionaire, the 53-year-old and wife Lynne, 55, from New Tredegar, had even better news to celebrate the day they found out about their lucky win.</p>
      <p>Lynne Price revealed she had opened a letter confirming her all-clear mammogram result after she survived a fight with breast cancer only minutes before David delivered the lottery win news.</p>

      <p>The parents-of-three run a laundrette in a residential care home for the elderly, and are still coming to terms with their good fortune.</p>
      <p>Lynne recalled how on the lucky day, October 29, David had waited until he got home from work to break the news: "Ten minutes before he came through the door, I had opened a letter saying I’d had the all-clear on my mammogram for 4 years in a row. I was so chuffed but put it on the unit, got on with making dinner and then he came in with this news.</p>
      <p>“I was gobsmacked. And I can usually talk for Wales. I stared at the wall for a while and then got in the bath. About two hours later, he came knocking to see if I was ok and I remembered to tell him about the letter.</p>
      <p>"Only the day before I had mentioned to him that I still hadn’t heard back from them and he said to leave it a couple of days then ring the hospital. The letter had totally gone out of my mind with his news – I honestly thought he was winding me up.”</p>

      <p>David added: “I got out of the way in case she clouted me for winding her up! Your wealth is your health so obviously Lynne’s news was much luckier than this even.”</p>
      <p>The good news was a relief for the couple, after David lost his mum to breast cancer the year before Lynne was diagnosed.</p>
      <p>Lynne said she had been diagnosed at around the same time as her own mum, and David had struggled with worry ever since.</p>
      <p>"He found it really hard – I just seemed to get on with it – but this was such a lucky day for us. October is our lucky month, it really is.”</p>

      <p>He also revealed how he had almost forgotten to check his tickets a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>He was at work at British Airways in Pontllanfraith, when a workmate reminded him to try his luck on the local football club’s £5,000 prize fund</p>
      <p>David suddenly remembered to check his two Lucky Dip Euromillions tickets on the app on his phone an hour before his shift finished.</p>
      <p>“Quite simply, I was gobsmacked,” he says.</p>
      <p>David had an hour left of his 11-hour shift until his 5pm finish, but did the rounds asking various friends and colleagues to double check his Millionaire Maker code for him.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t get much done in that last hour but stayed on, even when my manager told me at quarter to, to go home if I wanted to,” he laughs. “I was just shaking. Nobody could believe it.</p>

      <p>“I was in a daze, but drove back home to Lynne, who was on the sofa after a hard day, and greeted her with our usual ‘Alright mush?’”</p>
      <p>After he told her the incredible news, she at first thought he was pulling her leg.</p>
      <p>But she checked the tickets herself, and was astounded to see they had won £8 on one ticket and £1 million with the Millionaire Maker number on the other.</p>
      <p>The couple's win will help cover costs for David's £3k adventure to Everest.</p>
      <p>The couple are also planning on spending some of their winnings on a trip to China.</p>
      <p>David also donated £500 back to New Tredegar RFC to buy drinks for staff and punters - the amount he had won after drawing South Africa in the Rugby World Cup in the club's sweepstakes.</p>
      <p>The couple celebrated with their three children, who are 24, 26 and 32, and their families at a pub where his son works as a chef.</p>
      <p>Both returned to work just days later and say they are planning on taking their time to consider their options for spending their newfound fortune.</p>
      <p>This month marks the 25th anniversary of the National Lottery, which was first drawn on November 19, 1994 and has paid out more than £71 billion in prizes over the decades since.</p>
