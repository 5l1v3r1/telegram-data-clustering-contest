        <b>Many people go through well-intentioned vegan phases. But for Richard Melville Hall – better known as Moby – his veganism has lasted a full 32 years.</b>

      <p>To mark this impressive commitment, the 54-year-old dance music icon has now had the words ‘Animal Rights’ tattooed in large lettering down his arms.</p>
      <p>Inked in block capitals, <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/gaming/music-icon-blames-videogames-for-donald-trumps-election/">Moby</a> has made his animal rights activism stance clear yet again. And it’s certainly a bold look.</p>

        <b>Taking to Instagram on Tuesday, November 12, Moby shared a picture of himself proudly displaying his new body art, with the following explanatory caption:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>As November is my 32 year vegan anniversary i thought i’d get a tattoo (well, technically 12 tattoos) to celebrate. I’m a vegan animal rights activist for many reasons, but ultimately because i believe at the core of my being that every animal has the right to live their own life, according to their own will. Thanks @thekatvond @highvoltagetat #veganforlife #animalrights</blockquote>
      <p>Fans have applauded the ‘hardcore’ tattoo, and have expressed admiration towards the musician for once again promoting the cause of veganism in such a visible way.</p>

        <b>One person commented:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>So damn rad! November is my vegan anniversary too and I’m trying so hard to think of what vegan themed tattoo but this is awesome and classic!</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Meanwhile, PETA themselves commented:</b>

      <blockquote>We LOVE it! Your dedication to helping animals is far beyond the commitment to this tattoo.</blockquote>

      <p>This isn’t the only time Moby has had his concern for animal welfare written across his skin. Just two months ago, he shared a pic of another fresh tat bearing the words ‘Vegan For Life’. Not one to hide away his ink under a shirt, the words are emblazoned in black lettering on his neck.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The caption read:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I’ve been a vegan for almost 32 years, so getting this tattoo seemed like a pretty safe bet. Also, working for animal rights and animal liberation is my life’s work.<br/><br/>And to state the obvious, it’s a double entendre…thank you @thekatvond</blockquote>

      <p>Moby’s latest tattoo is the handiwork of <i>Miami Ink</i> star – and fellow vegan – Kat Von D.</p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <p>Moby has long been outspoken about his meat-free diet, even owning his very own LA-based vegan restaurant, Little Pine.</p>
      <p>We can only imagine the elaborate veggie ink Moby will choose when it comes to his 40th vegan anniversary…</p>
