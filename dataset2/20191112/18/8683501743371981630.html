      <p>As we have previously reported, this is a busy week on the “Release The Snyder Cut” front. The Zack Snyder fans behind the movement to get the Director’s Cut of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1722630/justice-league-review?pv=search"><i>Justice League</i></a> released are preparing for the two-year anniversary of the release of the theatrical cut – which occurs on Sunday, November 17. They have picked individual members of the League to celebrate each day this week, and today is The Flash. So, Zack Snyder <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464489/justice-league">played along</a> by releasing this new photo of Ezra Miller in the role.</p>

      <p>Zack Snyder dropped this photo of Ezra Miller as Flash on his <a href="https://twitter.com/Sean_OConnell/status/1194339913543692293">social media page</a> on Vero. The caption he included was, “Miller is the flash.” That was all, but it was more than enough to get the speculation running regarding what we are seeing in the shot.</p>
      <p>The prevalent theory seems to be that this happens near the end of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484404/why-this-could-be-a-huge-week-for-justice-leagues-release-the-snyder-cut-movement">Zack Snyder’s version of <i>Justice League</i></a> (and not the abomination that was dumped on fans in the theatrical cut). Rumors suggest that Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) will witness the members of the League failing to prevent the Unity with the Motherboxes, thereby allowing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484345/aquaman-stabs-steppenwolf-in-badass-snyder-cut-look-shared-by-jason-momoa">Steppenwolf</a> to complete his mission.</p>
      <p>So <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484316/zack-snyder-shares-glimpse-at-deleted-justice-league-scene-for-the-flash">The Flash</a> uses the Speed Force to travel back in time and reset things, giving the Justice League another shot at defeating their adversary.</p>

      <p>Why is this relevant now? Today happens to be the day carved out by the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut community as Ezra Miller Appreciation Day, and a flurry of Tweets supporting <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484089/henry-cavill-had-a-hilarious-response-to-ryan-reynolds-mustache-video">the Director’s Cut of <i>Justice League</i></a>, and specifically The Flash, arrived online. But the biggest vote of confidence always comes from the filmmaker his followers refer to as “The Boss.” So when Snyder shared this image, it once again <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different">kicked the campaign</a> into an even higher gear.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483480/surprise-jesse-eisenberg-hasnt-heard-of-the-snyder-cut">#ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement</a> has been working tirelessly for the better part of two years (and even moreso lately) to raise awareness for the version of the movie that they believe Zack Snyder has, and wants to share. In addition, they make sure that there is a charitable effort associated with all of their moves, raising funds for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a cause that is near and dear to the Snyders’ hearts.</p>
      <p>The end goal here is to get Warner Bros. to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483465/justice-league-composer-confirms-the-snyder-cut-of-the-score">release Zack Snyder’s version of <i>Justice League</i></a>, and thanks to the social contributions this week of people like Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa and Snyder himself, you can understand why those who are responsible for the Snyder Cut push feel that they are closer now than ever before to seeing that dream realized.</p>
