      <p>Aston Villa's Jota has issued an injury update as he battles back from a hernia operation.</p>
      <p>The summer signing from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> underwent surgery at the beginning of the month.</p>
      <p>Jota hasn't featured <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-brighton-carabao-cup-16975044">since the September 25 Carabao Cup win at Brighton and Hove Albion</a> .</p>
      <p>He was out of the starting XI picture before his operation, an unused substitute for three matches until he went under the knife.</p>

      <p>The Spaniard had started three of five matches, substituted in for his first couple of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> outings.</p>
      <p>With Villa really struggling with injuries, Jota has provided a major boost for boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> .</p>
      <p>First-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton missed the 2-1 defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> last time out, with captain Jack Grealish and starting centre-back also sitting out the trip to Molineux.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse, Heaton's replacement Jed Steer suffered a calf injury and Matt Targett limped out in first-half injury time.</p>
      <p>But Jota could be back soon, posting a video on Instagram of him doing sprinting drills with strength and conditioning coach Paddy Moore.</p>
