Be sure to check out our ranking of the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_best_pokemon_games_of_all_time">best Pokémon games of all time</a> if you're interested in how the games themselves face-off against one another.</p>
      <p>Reckon it's going to be a Gen 1 walkover? Read on to find out...</p>
      <h3>Fire-type Starter Pokémon - The Top 3 As Voted By You</h3>
      <p>In reverse order, Scorbunny scored the fewest number of votes - arguably to be expected seeing as very few have had the opportunity to get to know the Gen 8 firestarter yet. Perhaps more surprisingly, he was closely followed by the cute little Tepig in 7th place. Fennekin, Litten and Chimchar took 6th, 5th and 4th places respectively, but the first three generations made up the top 3...</p>
      <h4>3. Torchic</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>With 13% of the overall vote, Gen 3 starter Torchic couldn't do enough to rule the roost, but still managed a respectable podium finish.</p>
      <h4>2. Cyndaquil</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>24% of your love put Gen 2 Fire ´mon Cyndaquil in second place, which leaves only one possibility for the number one spot...</p>
      <h4>1. Charmander</h4>

      <p>Yes, the top 3 fire-places follow their order of release, with <i>Char-Char-</i>Charmander taking the top spot. We can't help thinking his ultimate evolution into the mighty Charizard gave this little fiery fellow a helping hand. However he managed it, it's hard to argue with that face.</p>
