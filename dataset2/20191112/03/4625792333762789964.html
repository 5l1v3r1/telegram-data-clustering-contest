      <h1>WATCH: Climate protesters scream '2050 is too late' at Joe Biden town hall</h1>

      <p>Climate change protesters interrupted former Vice President Joe Biden as he was explaining his plan to combat climate change.</p>
      <p>Biden appeared on a Veterans Day CNN town hall in Iowa to discuss a broad range of topics facing the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. While explaining his plan to combat climate change, protesters broke in to interrupt Biden, apparently because they considered his plan weak.</p>
      <p>"We have to get to net-zero emissions by 2050," Biden said.</p>
      <p>Protesters jumped in immediately after to chant, "2050 is too late, climate change will seal our fate!" The chant continued for a short time before the room regained order.</p>
      <p>"OK, thank you. Thank you. We appreciate your passion, but please respect the vice president and our town hall," CNN host Erin Burnett said as security officers escorted the protesters out of the venue.</p>
