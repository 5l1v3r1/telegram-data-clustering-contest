      <p>However, it recorded the slowest rise in a widely watched metric for its biggest business, social entertainment services, which executives attributed to growing competition.</p>
      <p>Tencent Music’s U.S.-listed shares rose as much as 2% before trading down about 1% in volatile extended trade.</p>
      <p>The company’s monthly average revenue per paying user from its social entertainment services unit rose 7.4% to 127.3 yuan ($18.20), the slowest growth since it went public in December.</p>
      <p>“We recognize that it may be slightly below where we previously thought it would be,” Tony Yip, chief strategy officer, said on a conference call. “That’s primarily because of increasing competition that we are facing with the short video platforms.”</p>
      <p>Tencent Music competes with Alibaba-backed NetEase Cloud Music in streaming services, and with short video sites such as Bytedance’s Douyin and Tencent-backed Kuaishou in social entertainment.</p>
      <p>Although its music streaming unit has more users, the company’s biggest revenue drivers are social entertainment services, including karaoke platforms, where users can live stream concerts and shows.</p>
      <p>The social entertainment business reported 12.2 million paying users during the quarter, up 23.2% from a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Yip said the firm will step up investment aimed at user growth, with a view to reach a younger demographic with content more appealing to them as well as initiatives such as offline singing competitions and partnerships with game studios.</p>
      <p>The company also said it is exploring opportunities to take services outside China and hopes to introduce monetization methods such as virtual gifts to Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Although Tencent Music’s user base is nearly three times that of world’s largest music streaming service, Spotify - a peer and stakeholder - its paying users are comparatively fewer.</p>
      <p>As of the third quarter, Spotify Technology SA had over 100 million paid subscribers, whereas Tencent Music had about 35 million.</p>
      <p>Tencent Music, which has a user base of over 900 million, has been shifting more content behind a paywall since May.</p>
      <p>The company, controlled by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, said paid users of its online music service jumped about 42% in the quarter ended September.</p>
      <p>Net income rose to 1.02 billion yuan from 964 million yuan a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose about 31% to 6.51 billion yuan, above estimates of 6.45 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, the company earned 0.74 yuan per American depositary share, above estimates of 0.66 yuan.</p>
