      <h1>Trump impeachment: Security establishment said US military aid to Ukraine was vital, testifies top defence official</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:21:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Joe Sommerlad, Clark Mindock</a></address>
      <p>America’s security establishment believed US military aid to Ukraine was vital and should not be jeopardised, a senior defence official told impeachment investigators probing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defence, told members of Congress that her department was “concerned” with delaying aid to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“DoD was concerned about the obligation of funds. Policy, my team, we were also concerned about any signal that we would send to Ukraine about a wavering in our commitment,” she said.</p>
      <p>She added: “And that’s another reason why, I mean, we did not want for this to be a big public discussion, you know, if we were about to get it turned back on again because we didn’t want to signal any lack of support.”</p>
      <p>Ms Cooper told investigators that soon after a meeting of national security officials at the White House, she was visited by Kurt Volker, the US special envoy to Ukraine, who explained there was a “statement” that the Ukraine government could make to get the security money flowing.</p>
      <p>Ms Cooper is the latest official whose private testimony has now been made public, as Democrats prepare for open testimony from three witnesses this week, starting on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr Trump was subjected to chants of “lock him up” as he addressed New York City’s Veterans Day parade after hitting out at House Intelligence Committee chairman <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a>, the top Democrat spearheading the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a>, accusing him of releasing “doctored transcripts” of witness depositions.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lev-parnas">Lev Parnas</a>, an associate of Mr Trump’s personal attorney <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, has meanwhile told <i>The New York Times</i> his client was tasked with offering <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> US military aid in exchange for a corruption investigation into 2020 candidate <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a> and his son.</p>
      <p>As Mr Giuliani denies the claim, the president has called on his fellow <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/republicans">Republicans</a> not to fall into the “fools trap” of questioning his 25 July call with the country’s new president, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelenksy</a>.</p>
