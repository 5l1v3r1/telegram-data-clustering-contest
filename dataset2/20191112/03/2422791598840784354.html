      <p>Three generations of a Canadian military family have attended Remembrance Day ceremonies in British Columbia.</p>
      <p>Great-grandfather John Cumbers, grandmother Joy Dockery and grandson Alexander Thomas laid a wreath at service in Coquitlam in memory of those servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</p>
      <p>The trio spend Remembrance Day together every year and firmly believe that Canada’s soldiers -- and the freedoms they fought to preserve -- should never be forgotten.</p>
      <p>Cumbers, 93, was a rear gunner in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>“I had my 18th and 19th birthdays in the Air Force,” he joked.</p>
      <p>Dockery served in the Royal Canadian Navy from 1968 to 1972.</p>
      <p>“It was the right thing to do, serve for your country, so I did so without even thinking,” she said.</p>
      <p>Thomas, 24, is also in the Air Force, stationed at Canadian Forces Base Trenton.</p>
      <p>“Every year we have fewer veterans and just every year I want to make the most of it,” Thomas said.</p>
