      <h2>Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal (PMT) clears a depot in Bhekrai Nagar, which was used to park CNG and diesel buses</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:32:16+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:32</time> by <a rel="author">Chaitraly Deshmukh</a></address>
      <p>Having acquired 100 electric buses and with the target of getting 500 additional buses, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal (PMT) has begun the task of turning a depot in Bhekrai Nagar. It also aims at beating Bengaluru to become the nation's first city to have stations exclusively for e-buses.</p>
      <p>At present, the PMT has cleared a depot in Bhekrai Nagar, which was used to park CNG and diesel buses until three days ago. Now 78 e-buses have been brought to the plot, which will now be converted into an electric bus friendly station with additional charging points.</p>
      <p>Another project is in the line for Nigdi in Pimpri-Chinchwad, where 22 e-buses are parked currently. In the coming months, the PMT plans to induct 125 more e-buses with the target of getting a total of 500 buses by next year. Of the 150 new e-buses, 75 will be parked at Bhekrai Nagar and the rest at Nigdi.</p>
