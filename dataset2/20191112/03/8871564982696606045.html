      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:53:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>A 75-year-old Frenchman who went missing while swimming in Bali’s Pasut Beach, Tabanan regency yesterday afternoon has been declared dead, the province’s Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas Bali) said, after his body was finally found just before midnight.  </p>
      <p>The victim, identified as Gilbert Henry Marcel Guidot, was found about a kilometer away from where he was last seen, according to a statement issued by Basarnas Bali. </p>
      <p>“The integrated Search and Rescue team conducted a search all night along the beach, and at 11:45pm the body was found face down,” said acting head of Basarnas Bali I Made Junetra, as quoted in the statement. </p>
      <p>Authorities said they received a report of the missing foreigner yesterday afternoon, and six personnel were then sent to the location. It took authorities about two hours to reach Pasut Beach, which was followed by a land search. There was no search using a rubber boat due to limited visibility in the evening hours, they said. </p>
      <p>According to the statement, Guidot’s body has been taken to Tabanan General Hospital.</p>
