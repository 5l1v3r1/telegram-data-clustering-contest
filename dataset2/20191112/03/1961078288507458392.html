      <h1>Jimmy Carter Is Recovering From a Brain Procedure</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:10:46+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:10</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Baker</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON — Former President Jimmy Carter was recovering at a hospital in Atlanta on Tuesday morning after undergoing a procedure intended to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding from recent falls, the Carter Center said.</p>
      <p>“There are no complications from the surgery,” the center, the Atlanta-based nonprofit that Mr. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, founded in 1982, <a href="https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1194270636857790464https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1194270636857790464">said on Twitter</a>. “President Carter will remain in the hospital as long as advisable for observation.”</p>
      <p>After Mr. Carter’s hospitalization was announced on Monday, Deanna Congileo, his spokeswoman, did not elaborate on what prompted the trip to the Emory University Hospital or any further details on the procedure.</p>
      <p>Mr. Carter, who in March became the longest-living president in American history, has endured a series of health setbacks in recent months only to bounce back. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/us/politics/jimmy-carter-hip-surgery.html?module=inline">He fell and broke a hip in May</a>, requiring surgery, then fell again twice last month, once resulting in 14 stitches days after his 95th birthday and then a second time fracturing his pelvis.</p>
      <p>But after his latest hospitalization, he again drove himself back into his active post-presidential life, showing up in Nashville to work on a Habitat for Humanity project just as he had done for years since leaving the White House. He sported a black eye and a head bandage but otherwise appeared undaunted by his physical challenges.</p>
      <p>He returned to <a href="https://mbcplains.org/">Maranatha Baptist Church</a> in Plains, Ga., a week ago to teach Sunday school and ruminated about the possibility of death. Recalling a bout with cancer four years ago, he said he would be at peace at the end.</p>
      <p>“I, obviously, prayed about it,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jimmy-carter-sermon-says-he-is-at-ease-with-death-sunday-school-service-today-2019-11-03/">he said</a>. “I didn’t ask God to let me live, but I just asked God to give me a proper attitude toward death. And I found that I was absolutely and completely at ease with death.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Carter, the nation’s 39th president, served one term from 1977 to 1981, determined to restore trust in government after the Watergate and Vietnam eras. He brokered a landmark peace agreement between Israel and Egypt at Camp David and passed treaties handing over control of the Panama Canal to Panama. But economic woes and the Iran hostage crisis hurt him politically, and he lost re-election to Ronald Reagan.</p>
      <p>In his busy post-presidency, Mr. Carter set up a center to promote conflict resolution, eradication of certain diseases in Africa, democratic election monitoring and other humanitarian causes. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 and achieved a measure of redemption after the indignity of his re-election defeat.</p>
