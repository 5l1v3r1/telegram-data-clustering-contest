      <p>American singer-songwriter <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Katy-Perry">Katy Perry</a> was all smiles as she touched down in Mumbai city, ahead of her debut gig at a music festival in the city, set to take place over the weekend. Rocking a de-glam avatar, the songstress was clicked at the airport, in grey sweatpants and a matching hoodie. With a cap on her head and dark glasses on, she put on her best smile for the cameras as she pushed her own bag to her waiting car.</p>
      <p>While her big gig is still days away, Katy is sure to busy herself with some touristy stuff and as reported earlier, will party it up with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a> and his Bollywood gang. The director is reportedly hosting a grand cocktail bash for the singer at his residence in Mumbai later this week.</p>

      <p>Although this is her first visit to Mumbai city, Perry is no stranger to the country. She previously performed at the opening ceremony of a T20 League in 2012 in Chennai. Before that, she even visited the country on a personal trip with her then actor-comedian beau <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Russell-Brand">Russell Brand</a>, who reportedly proposed to her at the Taj Mahal. They later tied the knot in a lavish ceremony in Rajasthan but sadly parted ways two years later.</p>
      <p>Also expected to arrive in the city is British Pop sensation <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dua-Lipa">Dua Lipa</a>, who will also be performing at the big gig.</p>
