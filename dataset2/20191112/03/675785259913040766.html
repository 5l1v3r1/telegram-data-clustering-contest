      <h2>Manager said James' all-round game is so good he can play in central midfield - and can fit into whatever formation Chelsea play</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:15:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:15</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard says Reece James could be deployed in central midfield in the future as his all-round game is so good.</p>
      <p>James was selected in his favoured right-back position ahead of Cesar Azpilicueta for Chelsea's 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And he impressed up against Wilfried Zaha, snuffing out the threat from the flying Palace winger.</p>
      <p>James may find it difficult to establish himself at right-back ahead of Azpilicueta on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>Lampard will be keen to retain experience in his defence having played a youthful back four of James (19), Kurt Zouma (25), Fikayo Tomori (21) and Emerson (25) on Saturday.</p>

      <p>But the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss said there will be opportunities for pacey James in whatever formation he selects - and predicted the teenager will move into midfield as his career progresses.</p>
      <p>"Right-back would be his favoured position," Lampard said in quotes reported by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/frank-lampard-hints-new-position-chelsea-star-reece-james-11079384/">Metro</a>. "Whether it be there, right wing-back or right of a three.</p>
      <p>"As he’s coming into the team, you’d see him there but he does have that all-round game that he could handle playing centrally in midfield if needs be.</p>
      <p>"At the moment we’ve got good players in there who are used to playing in there anyway, but he could always do that as he matures through his career."</p>

      <p>Lampard said Azpilicueta took it well when James was preferred to him for Saturday's game.</p>
      <p>"He took it as I thought he would do, as a perfect professional and it was not a problem," said Lampard.</p>
      <p>"He wants to play, of course he does, but I think he also understands the quality of Reece.</p>
      <p>"He’s played every game barring the Carabao Cup, and every minute of the games, so I don’t think it’s the worst for him to have a bit of a rest and now he can go away and have a rest. We’ve got massive games coming up after the break."</p>
