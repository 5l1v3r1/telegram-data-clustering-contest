      <p>JAIPUR: Twenty balls, seven runs, six wickets. A day after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a>'s incredible feat of registering the best-ever bowling figures in T20 Internationals, the cricketing world woke up to the immense potential of the 27-year-old 'Powerplay' bowler, who on Sunday redefined his utility by spearheading an inexperienced India attack to a series win.</p>
      <p>Chahar's exploits in the third T20 International against Bangladesh, however, may not have come to pass if 11 years ago his father, Lokendra Singh Chahar, had heeded the advice of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Greg-Chappell">Greg Chappell</a>, a former coach of the same national team the seam bowler now proudly represents.</p>

      <p>At a time when Chahar was still finding his way in age-group cricket, he was asked to look for a different occupation by Chappell, the then-director of the Rajasthan Cricket Academy. A pep talk by his father, who also happened to be his coach, flushed the sense of dejection out of the 18-year-old Deepak.</p>
      <p>Cut to Sunday in Nagpur and it was a night to remember for the 27-year-old Chahar as he broke numerous records on his way to creating a sensation - Deepak also became the first Indian male cricketer to claim a hat-trick in T20Is.</p>
      <p>Ekta Bisht was the first Indian cricketer to take a hat-trick in T20Is. Ekta achieved the feat against Sri Lanka in the play-off match of the ICC World Twenty20 in October 2012 in Colombo.</p>
      <p>Known primarily as a penetrative T20 new-ball 'swing' bowler because of his exploits with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2018-complete-ipl-squad-of-chennai-super-kings/articleshow/62684882.cms">Chennai Super Kings</a> (CSK) in the IPL, Chahar has also been required to bowl at the 'death' by captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> because of the present composition of India's attack. The right-arm seamer, who represents Rajasthan in domestic cricket, pulled off the challenge with aplomb to win the man-of-the-series award.</p>

      <p>The confidence and maturity Chahar is now showing is a direct result of the immense effort the bowler from Agra has put in over the years, first under his father and then former India captain MS Dhoni, his captain at CSK. The 27-year-old announced his presence in first-class cricket in loud fashion, taking eight wickets for 10 runs on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ranji-trophy">Ranji Trophy</a> debut as Hyderabad were all out for 21 at the SMS Stadium in 2010. A spate of untimely illnesses, however, delayed Chahar's progress. "Once it was jaundice, then a thumb injury. These issues cropped up when the domestic season was about to begin," his father Lokendra told TOI from Agra.</p>
      <p>Chahar picked up a cricket ball for the first time at age seven. By 12, was eyeing a career as a cricketer. His father, an assistant air traffic controller with the Indian Air Force, was posted at Suratgarh border in Rajasthan when Deepak started playing age-group cricket while studying in Kendriya Vidyalaya.</p>

      <p>After retiring from his job in 2006, Lokendra settled down in Agra and started a cricket academy at the GD Goenka School. Deepak played for Hanumangarh DCA, under the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajasthan-Cricket-Association">Rajasthan Cricket Association</a>, where he also trained under Navendu Tyagi, who was then secretary of the club.</p>
      <p>Lokendra made optimum use of the extra time after his retirement to help Deepak hone his skills. "Today, he has every delivery in his repertoire and he can bowl in any situation. Be it a bouncer, a slow bouncer, yorker, in-swingers, out-swingers, leg cutter, knuckle bowl... you ask and it's there. He has also developed the ability to read the mindset of batsmen. The presence of mind required to bowl at the death and in high-pressure situations has come from playing for CSK," Lokendra said. "Chappell lacked the eye to spot talent so he dismissed Deepak, but Dhoni had that ability and hence my child is flourishing."</p>
