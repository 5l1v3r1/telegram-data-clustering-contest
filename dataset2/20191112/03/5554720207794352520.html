      <p>Political analyst Tehseen Poonawalla faced a surprise eviction from the Colors TV’s popular reality show <i>Bigg Boss </i>just six days after he entered the house. The show’s host, Salman Khan, had indirectly trolled Tehseen while announcing his eviction during the <i>Weekend Ka Vaar </i>show. To add insult to injury, <i>Bigg Boss </i>on Monday night once again decided to target Tehseen.</p>

      <p>While addressing the contestants, who were huddled in the living area of the house, <i>Bigg Boss </i>reminded them why they ought to improve their game. <i>Bigg Boss </i>told them how Tehseen Poonawalla had left the competition<a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/bigg-boss-doesnt-evict-siddharth-shukla-after-unprecedented-protest-by-fans-tehseen-poonawalla-fights-with-asim-riaz/271622/"> within a week of entering</a> the show without ‘leaving any mark.’</p>
      <p>Shefali Jariwala, who became the captain of the house this week, earned plenty of plaudits from <i>Bigg Boss </i>because of her ability to win the captaincy task within days of becoming a part of the show. Shefali and Tehseen had joined the show together, but while the former has already become a serious contender to win the competition, Tehseen is out of the house and resumed his life as a political analyst.</p>

      <p>Monday night’s show saw housemates nominating two contestants, who were seen to be lagging behind others. They were Himanshi Khurana and Khesari Lal Yadav. Their punishment was to stay awake and guard the house until further notice. The announcement of their punishment left many housemates shocked. <i>Bigg Boss </i>called Shefali to the confession room to consider naming an alternative name since Himanshi was ill. After the public vote, Arhaan Khan was chosen to replace Himanshi for the punishment.</p>
      <p>Monday night’s episode also saw Siddharth Shukla and Shehnaaz Gill bury the hatchet in a cute way after the contestant from Punjab was caught placing flowers beside the former’s bed in the night’s darkness. Siddharth caught her and pulled her to his bed before giving her a warm hug.</p>
