      <p>Former President Jimmy Carter is scheduled to undergo an operation to relieve pressure on his brain.</p>
      <p>Carter, 95, was hospitalized on Monday and scheduled to undergo the operation on Tuesday morning, according to a statement released by the Carter Center. The pressure on Carter's brain is from internal bleeding caused by recent falls.</p>
      <p>Carter was admitted to Emory University Hospital and "is resting comfortably, and his wife, Rosalynn, is with him," according to the statement.</p>
