      <p>MADISON -  Former Madison Mallard Pete Alonso was named National League Rookie of the Year Monday.</p>
      <p> Alonso, a star first baseman with the New York Mets, got 29 of 30 first-place votes for NL Rookie of the Year.</p>
      <p>Braves right-hander Mike Soroka got the other first-place vote and finished second in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America revealed Monday night.</p>
      <p>Alonso was named Northwoods League Player of the Year in 2014 as a member of the Madison Mallards.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old Alonso led the majors with 53 homers, one better than Yankees slugger Aaron Judge's rookie record from 2017. "Polar Bear" Pete became the face of baseball in Flushing, beloved for his power, personality and philanthropy.</p>
      <p>He's the sixth Met to win the award and first since teammate Jacob deGrom in 2014.</p>
      <p>Padres shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. was third in NL balloting.</p>
      <p>The only voter to place Soroka ahead of Alonso was Andrew Baggarly of The Athletic. Alonso is the only NL player named on every ballot.</p>
      <p>Alonso, who played collegiately at the University of Florida, became an instant star in the Mets' blue and orange.</p>
      <p>He batted .292 with nine homers, 26 RBIs and a 1.024 OPS over March and April, claiming the first of three NL Rookie of the Month honors.</p>
      <p>He was the presumptive Rookie of the Year by midseason, even before putting on a power-packed show while winning the All-Star Home Run Derby. He cemented his fan-favorite status by donating $100,000 of his $1 million derby prize to charities supporting injured soldiers and 9/11 workers.</p>
      <p>Yordano Alvarez, a hulking designated hitter from the Houston Astros, won the American League Rookie of the Year Award. Alvarez earned all 30 first-place votes to become the 24th unanimous selection since the award was introduced in 1949.<br/><br/><br/><br/>​<i>Get your weather forecast from people who actually live in your community.
