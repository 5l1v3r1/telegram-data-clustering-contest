      <h1>Rejoice: All Three Seasons of ‘Broadchurch’ Are Coming To SBS On Demand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:12:06+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:12</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>I was in the UK on the day that the last episode of <i>Broadchurch</i> season one aired on television, and I can safely say that I’ve never seen anything quite like it.</p>
      <p>It is all that anybody talked about. People stopped each other on the street, grilling one another for clues about who they thought the killer might be. A man at the corner shop loudly complained about how his son had spent the last three days talking about nothing but <i>Broadchurch</i>. A ghastly pub I wandered into was playing the thing on television, like it was a sports match. The place was packed, and deathly silent.</p>

      <p>Needless to say, British people don’t go quite that hogwild for any TV series. They went wild for <i>Broadchurch</i> because it is contemporary television at its most engaging and intelligent — a brutalising look at sin, and hatred, and the terrible things that people do when they are pushed too far.</p>
      <p>Of course, it also features two of Britain’s finest talents in some of the key roles of their entire careers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant">David Tennant</a>, he of <i>Doctor Who</i> fame, brings new life to the grizzled cop cliche, while <a href="https://junkee.com/olivia-colman-oscars-speech/195344">Academy Award-winner Olivia Colman</a> steals the show as a force of pure light, gradually beaten down by the world.</p>
      <p>Well, if you’re yet to hop onto the <i>Broadchurch</i> train, then get excited — all three seasons of the show are hitting <i>SBS On Demand</i> this Thursday November 14.</p>
      <p>That means you’ve got hours of crime viewing ahead of you — just sit back, kick up your feet, and feast on some of the most heinous murder British TV ever mustered up.</p>
