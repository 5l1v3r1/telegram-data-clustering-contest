      <h1>US President Carter to undergo procedure to relieve pressure on brain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:35:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:35</time> by <a rel="author">Phil HelselÂ </a></address>
      <p>Former President Jimmy Carter was admitted to a Georgia hospital Monday and is scheduled to undergo a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding from recent falls, The Carter Center said.</p>
      <p>The procedure is set for Tuesday morning at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>"President Carter is resting comfortably, and his wife, Rosalynn, is with him," The Carter Center statement said.</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/former-president-jimmy-carter-celebrates-95th-birthday-n1060691">Carter turned 95</a>, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone.</p>
      <p>Later that month, the former president <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/jimmy-carter-recovering-fractured-pelvis-after-fall-n1069896">fractured his pelvis</a> when he fell at his home, the Carter Center said at the time. The fracture was called minor.</p>
      <p>He had fallen <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-president-jimmy-carter-95-feels-fine-after-fall-home-n1063081">earlier in the month</a> and received stitches above his brow. He was reported to be feeling fine after that <a href="https://twitter.com/CarterCenter/status/1180952204309651456">Oct. 6 incident</a> at his home.</p>
      <p>In May, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jimmy-carter-recovering-surgery-after-broken-hip-n1005161">Carter broke his hip and underwent surgery</a> after he falling at his home in Plains, Georgia, as he was leaving to go turkey hunting.</p>
      <p>Carter, the 39th president, said in August 2015 that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-president-jimmy-carter-discuss-cancer-diagnosis-n413026">he had been diagnosed with cancer</a> and would undergo treatment for several melanoma spots on his brain and liver. He had previously had a mass removed from his liver that was melanoma.</p>
      <p>He said months later that an MRI scan showed <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/president-jimmy-carter-says-cancer-brain-gone-n475056">his cancer was gone</a>.</p>
      <p>Carter was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize and has spent his post-presidential years as a highly visible advocate for the poor worldwide.</p>
      <p>Soon after his fall on Oct. 6, Carter appeared at a Habitat for Humanity project.</p>
      <p>Rev. Tony Lowden, Carter's pastor, said the former president was hospitalized Monday after "a rough day."</p>
      <p>"We just need the whole country to be in prayer for him," Lowden told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.</p>
      <p>The Maranatha Baptist Church <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MBCPlains/posts/2521476301430688?__tn__=-R">said in a statement on Facebook</a> that the former president will not be teaching Sunday school this week, and it asked people to pray for him and his family</p>
