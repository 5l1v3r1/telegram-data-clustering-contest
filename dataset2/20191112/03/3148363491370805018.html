      <p>During a town hall on CNN on Monday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden blasted Republican calls for his son, Hunter Biden, to testify as a witness in the impeachment probe by saying there is no reason for Hunter to testify and “This is all a diversion.”</p>
      <p>Biden stated, “There is zero rationale for that to happen. Nobody has suggested anything was done that was inappropriate. This is all a diversion. This is classic Trump.”</p>
