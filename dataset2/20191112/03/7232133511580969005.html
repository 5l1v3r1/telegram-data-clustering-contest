      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, there was a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/ethereum-eth-recovering-nicely-while-bitcoin-runs-into-resistance/">decent increase</a> in Ethereum above the $188 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH even surpassed the $190 resistance area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>However, the price struggled to gain strength above $190 and formed a high near the $192 level. Later, there was a downward move below the $188 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $180 swing low to $192 high. The bulls even failed to defend the $185 support and the price tested the $183 area.</p>
      <p>Ethereum is currently correcting higher and trading near the $186 level. Additionally, it is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $192 high to $184 swing low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $187 level. More importantly, there is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $187 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD, coinciding with the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>If there is an upside break above the trend line and the 100 hourly SMA, the price could test the $188 resistance area. Any further gains may perhaps push the price towards the $192 swing high in the near term.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price could decline further if it fails to clear the $188 resistance. An immediate support is near the $184 level. The main supports are near the $182 and $180 levels, below which the bears are likely to gain strength.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price seems to be trading in a broad range between $180 and $190. A successful close on the either side could trigger the next move. As long as there is no daily close below $180, there are chances of a fresh increase towards $200 and $205.</p>
