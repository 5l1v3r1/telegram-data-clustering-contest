      <p><b>Darcy Foster • </b>Ever wanted to option your car with a fluorescent purple interior straight out the factory?</p>
      <p><b>Conventional car seat covers</b> could soon be a thing of the past as <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/">Ford</a> looks to implement <b>'</b><b>3D knitting'</b> in its interior trimming.</p>
      <p>By experimenting with technologies prevalent in the manufacture of clothes and running shoes, Ford has created a way of using wool, polyester, or even silk to ‘print’ its own seat covers.</p>
      <p>Dubbed ‘human-centric design’, Ford says the process is aimed at allowing more customisation for buyers keen to stand out – and its customers would be included in the design process.</p>

      <p>It is also said to be more environmentally-friendly than current methods of seat cover production, and could potentially accommodate driver controls or even charge your mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Ford has previously highlighted its use of recyclable materials in the EcoSport SUV, which uses yarn from reused plastic bottles in its floor mats.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the BMW i3’s wooden interior trim is manufactured from Eucalyptus trees certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSO) which ensures environmentally-friendly forestry, while Fisker’s new SUV is said to extensively incorporate recycled materials in its design.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the 3D knitting process, Amko Leenarts, design director of Ford Europe, said “Human-centric design is all about inspiration, ideation and making".</p>
      <p>"It begins from our first thought and can, with the new technologies we are exploring, harness that first thought so it can be more effectively shared with others – as a 360° sketch.</p>
      <p>"It is a philosophy that runs through the ability to specify details that can be perfectly tailored to everyone inside the car, whatever their specific needs and desires.”</p>
      <p>This means the seats could be fitted with pockets for added practicality, or fabric specifically for pets, for example.</p>
      <p>No word if or when this technology may be implemented, but it could offer customers boundless customisation cheaply and in a more environmentally-friendly way than is currently available.</p>
