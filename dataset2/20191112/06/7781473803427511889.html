      <h1>Maruti Suzuki S-Presso CNG spotted testing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:06:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:06</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>A set of spy images have appeared which show what could be the CNG version of the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/maruti-suzuki/s-presso-m806/">Maruti Suzuki S-Presso</a> mini-SUV. The car is currently available with only a petrol model, but given that Maruti Suzuki plans to bring in a CNG-version for all its entry-level cars, the S-Presso could also get the same treatment.</p>

      <p><a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/maruti-suzuki-s-presso-first-drive-review/">The petrol S-Presso is powered by the 1.0-litre K10B three-cylinder motor</a> that makes 68PS and 90 Nm. This is paired with either a five-speed manual or AMT transmission. The CNG variant could see a slight dip in these outputs. The Celerio CNG, for instance, makes 60PS and 78 Nm. We expect the CNG S-Presso to return over 30 km/kg and come with 10 kg CNG tank. The petrol-powered S-Presso has a mileage of 21.7 kmpl of the VXi and AMT versions and 21.4 kmpl for the base trims.</p>

      <p>The S-Presso competes with the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/renault/kwid-m396/">Renault Kwid</a> and Mahindra KUV100. Only the fleet version of the Mahindra gets a CNG option. Prices for the S-Presso start at Rs 3.69 lakh for the Standard version and goes up to Rs 4.91 lakh for the VXi+ AGS version, both ex-showroom, Delhi.</p>
