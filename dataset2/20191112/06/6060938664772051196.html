      <h1>Bejewelled hair accessories are in trend this season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:03:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Joyeeta-Chakravorty-479252353.cms" target="_blank">TNN</a></address>
      <p>Think embellishments are meant for your outfits alone? Maybe, not. From Bollywood divas to fashionistas, everyone is flaunting their hair accessories this season. Headbands and hairclips now come adorned with faux pearls, crystals, rhinestones, silver beads, sequins and what not. These can not only up your style game, but lift your mood as well. “Headbands that are broader around the crown or those that come with a pearl-embellished bow are in trend now. These can go very well with your Western outfits,” says celebrity designer and stylist Laxmi Krishna. Celebrities like Deepika Padukone and Lilly Singh are sporting this look, while it’s becoming a fashion runway favourite. <b><br/>Have you got your ‘hair candy’ yet?</b></p>
      <p>“Embellished headbands or hairclips are like hair candies that can lend a fun factor to your personality. The biggest plus point about hair accessories is that these can complement any hairdo or apparel. Headbands and hairclips are also a great way to keep your hair in place. So, why not do that in style,” says Laxmi.</p>

        <b>Now is the time to go retro</b>
      </p>
      <p>“You can pick your hair accessories based on what outfit you want to slip into. Be it an off-shoulder jumpsuit, a high-neck top, vintage shirts, high-waisted bell bottoms or your little black dress, hair accessories are available for all kinds of occasions and clothing. And with the retro look making a major comeback this season, you just can’t say no to this vintage fashion favourite,” says stylist Nirjal Basnet. It all depends on your personality and how confidently you carry it off. “You can go cute or glam or even punk, with the headband style you choose,” she adds.</p>

        <b>Style tips to keep in mind</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to stylists, acing this look is not rocket science, but one needs to keep a few things in mind. “If you are wearing a statement outfit, pick a headband that’s simple and subtle and does not overpower your outfit. Colour coordination is another important aspect. Make sure you contrast it well with your outfit. And if you want to match your hair accessory with your outfit, ensure that the details complement each other. Most importantly, be confident and own the style you are sporting,” says Laxmi.</p>
