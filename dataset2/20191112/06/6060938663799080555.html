      <h1>Deepak Chahar is not the first Indian bowler to claim a T20I hat-trick, it was actually Ekta Bisht</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:34:07+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI: Indian medium pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> became the talk of the town when he claimed a hat-trick against Bangladesh in the third and final Twenty20 International in Nagpur and helped India clinch the three-match series 2-1.</p>
      <p>With Bangladesh chasing a target of 175, the 27-year-old Rajasthan seamer bagged 6 wickets for just 7 in 3.2 overs to register the best-ever figures in the history of T20 internationals, surpassing the previous record held by Sri Lanka's Ajantha Mendis who scalped 6/8 against Zimbabwe in 2012.</p>
      <p>Man-of-the-Match Chahar dismissed Shafiul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman and Aminul Islam to claim the incredible feat.</p>
      <p>But Chahar is not the first Indian cricketer to take a T20 international hat-trick, as was widely reported and tweeted by the BCCI.</p>

      <p>Chahar is the first Indian male cricketer to claim a hat-trick in T20Is. Before him, Indian female cricketer, spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ekta-bisht">Ekta Bisht</a> claimed a hat-trick during the ICC Womenâ€™s World Twenty20 Qualifier match against Sri Lanka in 2012. Mithali Raj-led India women crushed Sri Lanka by 9 wickets and Bisht was awarded the Player of the Match for performance. She had claimed 3/16.</p>

      <p>Ekta had dismissed Dualani Surangika, Yasoda Mendis and then Eshani Kaushalya to bag three wickets off three deliveries.</p>
      <p>So, Chahar is the first Indian male cricketer to take a hat-trick in T20 internationals, while Bisht was the first Indian cricketer (male or female) to achieve the feat.</p>
