      <p>Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley celebrated their first innings' in full England shirts with a pair of hundreds to open their account in style.</p>
      <p>For Warwickshire Sibley faced more than 1,000 more balls in the County Championship last summer than anyone else and he used that patient method to good effect following a delayed start in Whangarei.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old will play make his Test debut next week and he did precisely what he has been picked to do as Rory Burns' opening partner by starting off with caution before unfurling an array of shots that would have suited the recent T20 series.</p>
      <p>It might only have been a gentle warm-up match against an inexperienced New Zealand Cricket side, but he imposed himself on them with authority to enjoy the perfect start with a chanceless knock.</p>

      <p>Kent batsman Crawley, 21, is another tall man and he got into his stride even quicker than Sibley as they added 154 together before Sibley retired on exactly 100.</p>
      <p>On a sluggish pitch he found his timing from the off, and bar one sharp chance to short leg off left arm spinner Theo van Woerkom, he had everything pretty much his own way.</p>
      <p>He brought up his hundred with a lofted drive for four, his 13 of the day, but there was plenty of running in between thanks to the lush outfield.</p>
      <p>Burns was the only England batsman to be dismissed on the rain shortened day when he was well caught at third slip by Ken McClure off Henry Shipley for 23.</p>
      <p>Shipley had found Burns' edge twice in the previous over when he flashed one over the top of gully's head and then when second slip got a hand to one above his head only to see it hit the turf.</p>

      <p>Shipley got his deserved reward though and disappointingly for Burns was the fact that he had got himself in and had left the ball so assuredly in the opening skirmishes.</p>
      <p>Sibley was on 11 from 51 balls at the other end when Burns got out, and he made sure the fresh bowlers and the new ball didn't do for him as well.</p>
      <p>Joe Root enjoyed watching on for most of the day, but when he joined the fray he found life in the middle as comfortable as you'd expect in racking up a run-a-ball 41 before the close.</p>
      <p>The rest of the squad trained in the nets during play where Ben Stokes took a bang to his left wrist and had it bandaged as a precaution, but it is not thought to be serious.</p>
