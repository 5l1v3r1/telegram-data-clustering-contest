      <h1>Hyundai Venue waiting period extends up to 15 weeks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jaiveer Mehra</a></address>
      <p>1.0-litre turbo-petrol variants see a waiting period of up to 15 weeks, while select variants of the 1.2 petrol and 1.4 diesel engines see it go up to six weeks.</p>
      <p>The Venue has proved to be a very popular model in Hyundai’s stable. In the months following its launch, the sub-four-meter SUV has seen strong demand and has quickly risen in the sales chart to go toe to toe with the Vitara Brezza. This demand has also affected the compact SUV’s waiting period, which has now gone up to 15 weeks, depending on the engine-gearbox combination and trim level in question.</p>
      <p>As per dealer sources, the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol continues to see strong demand, with the engine option seeing the highest waiting period, particularly in its mid-spec S trim level. Recapping briefly, the Venue is offered with a choice of three engine options, a 1.2 naturally aspirated petrol, the aforementioned turbo-petrol, and a 1.4-litre diesel, with the S trim being the sole variant to offer all three options; the turbo-petrol unit is offered with either a manual or DCT automatic gearbox option.</p>
      <p>The Venue S 1.0 DCT has the longest waiting period – pegged at up to 15 weeks – with its manual 1.0-litre counterpart seeing a waiting period of up to eight weeks. Interestingly, the diesel in this trim too has the longest waiting period, at six weeks.</p>
      <p>The higher, mid-spec SX and fully-loaded SX(O) trim levels have a waiting period of only about two weeks, notwithstanding the engine-gearbox combination. The SX(+) trim level – available only with the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol paired with the DCT gearbox – has a waiting period of three weeks.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the base 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine-equipped Venue E has a waiting period of six weeks.</p>
      <p>Hyundai launched the Venue in May this year, with the model being the company’s first car to offer its suit of BlueLink connected-car features. Prices for the compact SUV range from Rs 6.50 lakh for the base petrol to Rs 11.11 lakh for the most expensive variant - the top-spec petrol-automatic. The Venue rivals the likes of the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV300, Ford EcoSport and the Maruti Vitara Brezza.</p>
