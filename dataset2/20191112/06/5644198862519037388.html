      <h1>Commentary: Space travel? Virgin Galactic leads the race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:24:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Brennan</a></address>
      <p>Richard Branson's space travel company has recently listed and, according to Trinity College Dublin's Louis Brennan, it is poised to provide healthy returns to investors.</p>
      <p>DUBLIN, Ireland: Richard Branson rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct 28 as Virgin Galactic became the first commercial spaceflight company to <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/richard-branson-s-virgin-galactic-takes-off-in-nyse-debut-12041336">list</a> on the stock market. </p>
      <p>It was valued at more than US$1 billion following its merger with publicly-listed holding firm Social Capital Hedosophia, then experienced a 20 per cent drop in its share price after a week of trading. It is now worth around US$800 million.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The route to success in the space tourism industry is bound to be a wild ride and Mr Branson is hoping his first mover advantage will bring healthy returns in the long run. Indeed, this high-risk venture could well pay off – it is just a question of when.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A 90-MINUTE FLIGHT FOR US$250,000</b>
      </p>
      <p>Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004 to offer paying customers a trip into suborbital space. For US$250,000, anyone can take a 90-minute flight into the upper reaches of the atmosphere where they will experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth’s surface.</p>
      <p>According to Virgin, 600 people from some 60 countries have already made their reservations, while a further 3,700 people have registered for the opportunity to buy flights once ticket sales are back on offer. </p>
      <p>This suggests that the combination of Mr Branson’s marketing prowess and the allure of space for humans are a plausible value proposition for investors.</p>

      <p>Virgin is also offering a much cheaper route to experiencing space than its competitors. There have only been seven space tourists to date and none since 2009. </p>
      <p>All travelled on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) at a reported price tag of tens of millions of dollars.</p>

        <b>MORE SEATS TO SPACE</b>
      </p>
      <p>NASA announced in June that it would offer trips to the ISS at a cost of US$35,000 per night, not including the cost of a taxi ride there from SpaceX and <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/boeing-spacecraft-astronauts-see-new-frontier-for-commercial-space-11833334">Boeing</a>. </p>
      <p>The cost of these rides is likely to be at least US$60 million, which is what NASA pays to take its astronauts to the ISS, and these visits are due to start in 2020.</p>
      <p>In September 2018, SpaceX unveiled its 2023 lunar passenger flight that would take Japanese billionaire businessman Yusaku Maezawa and six of his guests on a space flight around the moon using its Big Falcon Rocket for an undisclosed, but certainly a very substantial, price.</p>

        <b>VIRGIN'S SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although it has yet to fly any paying passengers and is currently loss making, Virgin Galactic aims to be profitable by 2021, based on completing 115 flights that generate US$210 million in revenue.</p>
      <p>By 2023, it is forecasting revenues of US$590 million and expects to have flown more than 3,000 passengers. Since that number is a tiny portion of the target market of high net-worth individuals with assets of at least US$10 million, its projections could well be achievable.</p>
      <p>And, currently, Virgin Galactic appears to be ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/billionaire-bezos-unveils-moon-lander-mockup--embraces-trump-s-lunar-timetable-11520428">Blue Origin</a> in fulfilling the vision of space tourism.</p>
      <p>While Virgin Galactic has failed to deliver on expectations in the past – it missed its own targets for flights commencing and experienced a catastrophic accident in 2014 – it has more recently made substantial progress. In December 2018 it achieved its <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/virgin-galactic-completes-manned-space-test--more-flights-soon-11030052">first suborbital space flight</a>.</p>
      <p>Given that achievement and subsequent progress, it seems likely that commercial flights could commence within the next 18 months.</p>
      <p>It is also diversifying its offering as it gears up for launch. In collaboration with the sportswear maker Under Armour, Virgin Galactic has developed a line of high-tech clothing that its passengers will wear on their flights.</p>
      <p>At the same time, it is moving into its new facilities at Spaceport America in the desert lands of New Mexico.</p>

      <p>Spaceport America, where Virgin’s flights will take off from and return to, has a US$220 million investment by the New Mexico government. It is also here that passengers will undergo three days of training to prepare for the G-forces and weightlessness that they will experience on flights.</p>

        <b>THE BUSINESS OF SPACE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The business of space tourism is only just beginning. Air travel similarly started small with a limited target market, but grew to become a mass market with many commercial air carriers and millions travelling every month, served by airports that over time became large commercial hubs.</p>
      <p>The trajectory for space tourism travel in the decades to come has the potential to be similar. From a highly niche market, it can become one that has much broader appeal when costs reduce.</p>
      <p>At the same time, spaceports can, like airports before them, become large concentrated centres of commercial activity. </p>
      <p>Should Virgin Galactic maintain its first-mover advantage in space tourism in the years ahead, there is the prospect for healthy returns to investors in this high-risk venture.</p>
