      <p>On November 12, girl group <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/nature">Nature</a> greeted the press during their comeback showcase in light of the release of their 2nd mini album, '<b>Nature World: Code A</b>'!</p>
      <p>This comeback marked Nature's first since the addition of former '<b>Produce 101</b>' season 1 contestant, <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/so-hee">So Hee</a>. First, So Hee gave her thoughts on her addition to Nature, with, <i>"I've promoted in a lot of project groups up until now, but now, I've been hired 'full-time' with the Nature members. I'm still processing it, and I feel nervous about it. But I believe that I am here as I am now because of the difficult and tough times in the past. I want to thank fans for waiting for me. They worried about me a lot since I always seemed to be a part of project groups, but now, I'll be with the Nature members for life." </i></p>
      <p>The idol then opened up about her uncertainties in joining the group. <i>"I worried a lot at first. I tend to put up a wall around strangers, so I wasn't sure if I could become friends with the members quickly, since we had to practice for our comeback as soon as possible," </i>So Hee said. </p>
      <p>Fellow Nature member <b>Lu</b> revealed how she welcomed So Hee into the team. <i>"She got along with us well. I was personally always the slowest in Nature when it came to learning choreography, so when I found out that So Hee unnie is also a bit slow with it, I was glad. I would always remain in the practice room by myself to practice, but now, I can practice with unnie and we help each other out,"</i> Lu commented. To this, So Hee warmly added, <i>"I was also glad to have someone like Lu." </i></p>
      <p><b>Loha</b>, the team's main dancer, also had a compliment for So Hee. <i>"I usually practice with my eyes only on myself in the mirror, but my eyes kept looking at So Hee unnie for some reason."</i> So Hee returned the compliment with, <i>"Loha is younger than me, but she's like an unnie when she's teaching me choreography. Her charisma is no joke." </i></p>
