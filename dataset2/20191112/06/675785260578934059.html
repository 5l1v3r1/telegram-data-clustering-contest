      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:34:54+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Amanda Holden paused her busy schedule to enjoy a 'school night' drink with two of her best friends.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old Heart Radio Breakfast show presenter took time out to relax and unwind in the company of her fellow Britain's Got Talent judge, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alesha-dixon">Alesha Dixon</a> and former Dragon's Den star, Kelly Hoppen.</p>
      <p>The trio were all smiles in the pic that Amanda shared with her followers on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , as they enjoyed what looks like a glass of bubbly as their 'school night' out got off with a sparkling start.</p>
      <p>Amanda's scooter was out of sight as she leaned between the pair for the cheeky snap.</p>
      <p>The radio presenter has been keeping mobile with the help of the three-wheeled contraption, after she broke her leg in two places in an accident while on holiday.</p>

      <p>Amanda was looking as resplendent as ever, in a black halter neck outfit which featured a cut out.</p>
      <p>Alesha meanwhile went for a bright yellow blazer and Kelly looked glamorous in a shimmering gold dress.</p>
      <p>Amanda captioned the image of the trio on Instagram: "Out on a #schoolnight so wonderful to catch up with these two lovely friends @aleshaofficial @kellyhoppen."</p>
      <p>Kelly also shared the fun and posted the picture, saying: "Girls night out with these two gorgeous friends always such a laugh #goodforthesoul @noholdenback @aleshaofficial."</p>
      <p>Alesha was a little more refined when sharing the pic as she just titled it simply: "Ladies Night"</p>
