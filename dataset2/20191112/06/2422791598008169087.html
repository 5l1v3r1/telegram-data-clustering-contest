      <h1>Defending champ Zverev beats error-prone Nadal at ATP Finals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:29:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:29</time> by <a rel="author">Mattias Karen, The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>LONDON -- After being thoroughly outplayed by defending champion Alexander Zverev at the ATP Finals, Rafael Nadal refused to make any excuses.</p>
      <p>The top-ranked Spaniard wouldn't blame the abdominal problem that forced him to pull out of the Paris Masters semifinals just nine days earlier, or a hand injury that kept him sidelined before that. And he bristled at the notion that his recent marriage could be a factor in a sub-par performance.</p>
      <p>Something was clearly off for Nadal, though, who lost 6-2, 6-4 to a player he had a perfect 5-0 record against before Monday's match at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>Nadal dropped his serve three straight times, didn't force a single break point, and his normally powerful forehand was responsible for more than four times as many unforced errors (13) as winners (3).</p>
      <p>Still, Nadal insisted there was nothing wrong with him physically.</p>
      <p>"I did not feel pain in the abdominal at all," he said. "So the physical issue was not an excuse at all. The only excuse is I was not good enough tonight."</p>
      <p>Nadal hasn't finished a tournament since winning the U.S. Open in August, also pulling out of Shanghai because of a hand injury. That lack of playing time certainly isn't helpful coming into an event featuring only the top eight players in the world, rather than lower-ranked early opponents.</p>
      <p>He still has to face Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev in round-robin play, and probably has to beat both in order to reach the semifinals.</p>
      <p>"Knowing that I would not be at my 100% in terms of feelings, in terms of movement, in terms of confidence or hitting the ball, I needed my best competitive spirit this afternoon, and I was not there in that way," Nadal said. "I need to play much better in two days."</p>
      <p>The Spaniard then got a bit testy when a journalist asked whether his October marriage to longtime girlfriend Maria Francisca Perello has changed his outlook on the game at all.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, are you asking me this? Is that a serious question or a joke?" Nadal bristled. "It is a big surprise for me (that) you ask me this after I have been with the same girl for 15 years and having a very stable and normal life. Doesn't matter if you put a ring on your finger or not."</p>
      <p>For Zverev, this latest win means he has beaten each of tennis' Big Three in his last three matches at the O2.</p>
      <p>The German defeated six-time champion Roger Federer in last year's semifinals and then five-time winner Novak Djokovic in the final.</p>
      <p>"It's definitely a place and a court that I love, and that brings maybe the best out of me," the seventh-seeded German said.</p>
      <p>Nadal has a history of being far from his best at the ATP Finals, which comes at the end of a gruelling season that often takes its toll on the Spaniard because of his ultra-physical playing style. He has qualified for the event for 15 years in a row but has pulled out of it on six occasions because of injuries. He has never won the title, reaching the final twice.</p>
      <p>But he showed up to London hoping to stave off Djokovic for the year-end No. 1 ranking.</p>
      <p>Djokovic won his opening match on Sunday and this loss cuts Nadal's lead over the Serb to just 440 points in the rankings table - each round-robin win is worth 200 points - with a total of 1,300 more points up for grabs for each player.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Tsitsipas earned his first career win over Medvedev - a victory that clearly meant a lot to the Greek not only because Tsitsipas was 0-5 against the Russian before winning 7-6 (5), 6-4, or that it came in his ATP Finals debut.</p>
      <p>But mainly because two of the biggest rising stars in tennis simply don't like each other that much.</p>
      <p>"It's a victory that I craved for a long time now, and it's great that it came at this moment," Tsitsipas said. "Our chemistry definitely isn't the best that you can find on the tour. It's not that I hate him (but) we will not go to dinner together."</p>
      <p>The grudge dates to their first meeting, in Miami last year, when Medvedev berated Tsitsipas for not apologizing after hitting a net cord during a point, a spat that ended with both players trading insults on court.</p>
      <p>"After that, I think I didn't win a single game. He did get into my head, and I was very frustrated that it did go this way," Tsitsipas said. ""e started telling me that I should apologize, that what I do is unsportsmanlike. I did get (angry) and said what I said, which I do regret, but at the time I was very frustrated."</p>
      <p>On Monday, the sixth-seeded Greek earned the only break of the match to lead 5-4 in the second set and clinched the win with a forehand overhead at the net.</p>
      <p>"He was better today, but I felt like I was missing some things," said Medvedev, the U.S. Open runner-up. "This frustrates me after. I do think it would frustrate me against any other opponent. I hate to lose against anybody."</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Federer faces Matteo Berrettini and Djokovic takes on Dominic Thiem.</p>
