      <h1>AOC goes on the attack after ABC pulls pin on Olympic radio broadcast rights for first time since 1952</h1>

      <p>The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has criticised the ABC's "monumentally short-sighted" decision to not buy the live radio broadcast rights for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The ABC made the decision not to buy the rights to the Olympics due to budgetary pressures</li>
        <li>The AOC described the decision as "a great letdown to Australians", particularly those in regional areas</li>
        <li>ABC radio caller Quentin Hull described the decision as "a national shame"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That means that, for the first time since the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, the ABC will not have a live radio broadcast of the Games, with the national broadcaster citing "budget pressures and the changing broadcast environment" as reasons not to bid for the non-commercial radio rights.</p>
      <p>"This is an incredibly tough decision, especially given our 67-year run as the official non-commercial Olympic Games radio broadcaster," the ABC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Due to competing budget priorities coupled with the fact that Australians can access Olympic Games coverage in many other ways, we have chosen not to pursue rights in 2020."</p>
      <p>The AOC called on the ABC to reverse the decision and said it was "prepared to put this case to the chair of the ABC directly".</p>

      <p>"The AOC believes the decision is monumentally short-sighted and a great let down to Australians who rely on their national broadcaster — from the smallest of communities to our suburbs," AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said.</p>
      <p>"We live in times when we need to inspire even more Australians to participate in sport to defeat the growing scourges of obesity and mental illness."</p>
      <p>The AOC said it was a particularly ill-advised move with Tokyo 2020 taking place in a time zone that is more conducive to listening and watching than Rio four years ago.</p>
      <p>Carroll also suggested covering things like the Olympics on live radio was pivotal to the ABC's charter.</p>
      <p>"The Olympics can inspire Australians to embrace something valuable and, as the ABC's charter indicates, to contribute to a sense of national identity. There's no bigger event in the world to fulfil this ambition," he said.</p>
      <p>"There is no sporting movement in Australia that covers the multicultural and geographical diversity of our country as the Olympic movement. … These are things go to the heart of the ABC charter."</p>
      <h3>'ABC will lose part of its DNA'</h3>
      <p>The ABC's statement made clear ABC News and ABC Grandstand would still be providing daily updates throughout the Games.</p>
      <p>ABC radio caller Alister Nicholson said he felt "absolutely flat" and "empty in the stomach" after hearing the news.</p>

      <blockquote>"That idea that I would be part of the sports department that didn't any longer cover the Olympic Games is really deflating," he told ABC Radio Melbourne.</blockquote>
      <p>"I can't say too much about it. Obviously this is a decision that has been made a lot higher up the chain than myself.</p>
      <p>"I know that it is a difficult environment budgetary-wise for the ABC at the moment, and it's not an inexpensive thing to mount a broadcast of the Olympic Games."</p>
      <p>Nicholson described the ABC team that was sent to the 2016 Rio Games as a "trimmed back … skeleton team" that he was lucky enough to be a part of.</p>
      <p>"I'm not so much disappointed for myself, I'm disappointed for the athletes and for the public," he said.</p>

      <p>"You think about all the great stories there are to tell — and yes, we will continue to cover in some capacity — we won't have broadcast rights in the sense that we will be able to call those great moments."</p>
      <p>Fellow broadcaster Quentin Hull tweeted: "The ABC will lose part of its DNA by not being at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>"The coverage has always shed a light on amazing stories of not only Australians, but human achievement the world over.</p>
      <p>"It's a national shame."</p>
