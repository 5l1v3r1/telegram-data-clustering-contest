      <p>The 33-year-old former Bryanston High School sports coach accused of sexual harassment will today find out whether the Director of Public Prosecutions will review the decision to prosecute him.</p>
      <p>The former coach - who may not be named as he is yet to plead – was arrested in January after a 17-year-old pupil at the school and her mother opened a case against him, News24 previously reported.</p>
      <p>It is unclear on what basis the former coach wants the decision to be reviewed.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The hearing will take place at the Alexandra Magistrate’s Court, where he has been appearing on previous occasions. </p>
      <p>In March, he was dismissed by the school following a disciplinary hearing which found that he was indeed guilty of sexual harassment and financial mismanagement. </p>
      <p>At least three other female pupils from the school also came forward with allegations, News24 reported.</p>
      <p>The alleged incidents of sexual assault were said to have taken place during netball matches and on school outings between 2017 and 2018.</p>
