      <p>KUCHING, Nov 12 — The Sarawak government will set up a committee to monitor the teaching of Science and Mathematics in English in Primary One classes next year, state Education, Science and Technological Research Minister Datuk Seri Michael Manyin said today.</p>
      <p>He said the committee will consist of representatives from the state ministry, relevant federal government agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
      <p>“The committee will detect any problem as quickly as possible so that remedial actions can be taken early.</p>
      <p>“We will give six months or even one year for the committee to monitor the progress of the teaching of science and mathematics in English,” he told reporters after his wind-up speech in the state legislative assembly here.</p>
      <p>Manyin said the state government does not want the teaching in English to fail like the dual language programme policy.</p>
      <p>He said under the dual language programme, teachers are given the option to teach science and mathematics either in English or Bahasa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“But most of the teachers prefer to choose Bahasa Malaysia,” he said.</p>
      <p>Manyin said the state has prepared sufficiently to make the switch a success, including providing training to the 2,853 primary school science and mathematics teachers and resource materials in English on both subjects.</p>
      <p>“The textbooks and workbooks are now ready and will be distributed to all schools by the end of this month.</p>
      <p>“In addition, we are also producing videos of experienced teachers teaching science and mathematics in English and these videos will be distributed to all schools as supplementary resources,” he said.</p>
