      <p>Earlier this month, Macron <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911101077272522-heiko-maas-emmanuel-macron-european-army/">slammed the North Atlantic Alliance</a> saying it is experiencing ''brain death''. Germany rushed to dismiss this claim, with Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting the alliance is "a cornerstone" of the European Union's security.</p>
      <p>Macron was also criticized for his plan of building a pan-European military, as the US President urged that NATO countries should pay their share of the alliance in the first place.</p>
