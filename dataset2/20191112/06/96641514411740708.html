      <h1>'Sonic the Hedgehog' movie tries again with a new trailer</h1>
      <h2>The nightmare is over.</h2>

      <p>Paramount's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/30/sonic-hedgehog-live-action-movie-trailer/">original trailer</a> for the upcoming <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>movie was... really something, wasn't it? The under-stylized body, the odd soundtrack choice, the <i>teeth</i>. Such was the Sonic fandom's collective horror that director Jeff Fowler swiftly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/24/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-delayed-design/">announced</a> the movie would be put on pause until the studio got the design right. Now, they think they've nailed it.</p>

      <p>The new trailer -- which has received an outpouring of relieved gratitude from fans -- features an altogether less unsettling Sonic, with a properly-styled body, friendlier eyes and an absolutely normal mouth. The trailer is crammed full of highlights, showcasing what the movie has in store, and -- crucially -- it uses the OG Sonic music. If it's Paramount's attempt at an apology, then all is forgiven. The movie arrives in theaters on February 14th next year.</p>
