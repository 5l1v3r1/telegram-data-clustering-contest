      <p>Vera Pauw will be forced into at least three changes in personnel as Ireland hunt a third successive victory in their Euro campaign against Greece today.</p>
      <p>Wins over Montenegro and especially Ukraine have spiked hopes of a first-ever major tournament qualification for the Girls in Green — but they cannot afford a blemish in this afternoon’s outing.</p>
      <p>“Greece are below us in the seedings, so we really need the three points,” says star player Denise O’Sullivan.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have every bit of confidence in this team to go out and get the win.”</blockquote>
      <p>With temperatures of around 20C predicted at the Nea Smyrni Stadium in Athens, this shouldn’t be a burden for Ireland.</p>
      <p>And between captain Katie McCabe and striker Rianna Jarrett, they have plenty of power and pace to stretch the hosts.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan’s intricate passing will be crucial on an afternoon when patience will be required.</p>
      <p>“We are not going to take Greece lightly,” O’Sullivan continued.</p>
      <p>“Even as the home team, they will sit deep, wanting us to break them down.”</p>
      <p>Pauw is without Heather Payne and Megan Campbell for her second competitive game at the helm.</p>
      <p>Florida State University refused to release Payne, while Ireland are denied the services of long-throw specialist Campbell after she suffered concussion while playing for Manchester City against Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Brighton’s Cork star Megan Connolly is also injured.</p>
      <p>Despite being favourites, Ireland face a Greece side also showing signs of promise in the campaign.</p>
      <p>They racked up a 4-0 victory in Montenegro — scoring two more than Ireland did against the minnows at home — but suffered a 5-0 defeat to Germany.</p>
      <p>Given eight-time champions Germany put 18 goals past second seeds Ukraine over two meetings, it suggests they are capable of causing Ireland real problems.</p>
      <p>Anything less than victory will probably mean Ireland’s only hope of qualifying is through the play-off rather than as clinching one of the best three runner-up berths across the nine pools.</p>
      <p><b>IRELAND (probable):</b> M Hourihan; K Keenan, L Quinn, D Caldwell, C Mustaki; T Toland, N Fahey; L Kiernan, D O’Sullivan, K McCabe; R Jarrett.</p>
