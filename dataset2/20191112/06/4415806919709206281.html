      <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter was admitted to a hospital on Monday evening for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding due to recent falls, his spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The procedure is scheduled for Tuesday morning at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, Deanna Congileo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mr Carter has fallen at least three times this year, and the first incident in the spring required hip replacement surgery.</p>

      <p>He traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, and helped build a Habitat for Humanity home after getting 14 stiches following a fall on October 6.</p>
      <p>And he was briefly hospitalized after fracturing his pelvis on October 21.</p>
      <p>He received a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 but survived and has since said he is cancer-free.</p>
      <p>Nearly four decades after he left office and despite a body that’s failing after 95 years, the nation’s oldest-ever ex-president still teaches Sunday school roughly twice a month at Maranatha Baptist Church in his tiny hometown of Plains in southwest Georgia.</p>
