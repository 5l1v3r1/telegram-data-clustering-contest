        <b>Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan praised Shai Hope for playing a brilliant knock of 109* and depriving the Afghanistan bowlers of any chance to salvage a victory in the series. Hope hit an unbeaten 109 as West Indies won the third ODI by five wickets and completed a 3-0 whitewash over Afghanistan.</b>

      <p>West Indies cricket seems to be on the rise ever since <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kieron_pollard">Kieron Pollard</a> has been handed the reigns of captaincy as he wins his first ODI series as a skipper 3-0 against Afghanistan. Batting first, Afghanistan had posted a competitive total of 249 thanks to some late hitting and a strong finish by Asghar Afghan and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_nabi">Mohammad Nabi</a>. Chasing 250, West Indies got off to the worst possible start as Mujeeb Ur Rahman reduced them to 4-2. But Shai Hope was determined to stay at the crease and strung vital partnerships with skipper Pollard and then <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/roston_chase">Roston CHase</a> to ensure that the Windies won comfortably in the end by five wickets.</p>
      <p>The Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan lauded Hope's innings and also said that his team played well but Hope did not give them any chance to get into the game after the early blows by Mujeeb.</p>
      <p>"We have improved as a team in every game. Asghar and Nabi finished in the right manner and helped us in posting a good total," Rashid said in the post-match presentation ceremony.</p>
      <p>Â "We should have defended that target but Hope didn't give us any chance. He batted superbly," the skipper added.</p>
      <p>Rashid still believes in his players and said that they need not change anything but need to play with more freedom and he also hopes that Afghanistan will bounce back in the T20I series against the West Indies.</p>
      <p>"Nothing to change, we just need to focus on taking the right decisions. And my message to the boys would be to enjoy their cricket," Rashid concluded</p>
