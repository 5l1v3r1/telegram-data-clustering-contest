      <h2>Progress is being made on business projects across the city</h2>

      <p>Plans are progressing for a series of city council-funded industrial units to support the growth of the economy in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>The local authority is expected to submit a planning application in December for Phase 3 of Hearder Court at Langage Science Park.</p>
      <p>The proposal for around 27,000 square feet of industrial space costing an estimated £2.9m will support up to 68 jobs.</p>
      <p>City council leader Tudor Evans revealed a planning application was due to go in before Christmas.</p>
      <p>The development was named in honour of Plymouth scientist Jonathan Nash Hearder, an electrical engineer, inventor and educator who was an advisor on the first Atlantic cable.</p>
      <p>Phase One in the industrial park on the edge of Plympton was completed in 2015 and is occupied by Dartmouth Foods Ltd. The £3.2m second phase was completed last year.</p>
      <p>Cllr Evans highlighted progress on the next part of the scheme as one of a series of city council-funded developments coming forward to support the local economy.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader told a meeting of the council’s ruling Cabinet: “We are confident as we have proved with a number of these projects, if we build it they will come. </p>
      <p>“Taxpayers can be reassured we are investing this money wisely. It produces jobs, it produces business rates, it produces confidence for the future.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Evans also revealed work was due to start in January at Broadley Park, Roborough, a £2.6m scheme to create 22,500 square feet of work space, supporting an estimated 62 jobs.</p>
      <p>And he said a planning application was expected to be submitted early next year for 20,000 square feet of health units at Plymouth International Business Park at Derriford.</p>
      <p>The council is also set to fund the construction of a new 126-bed hotel on a redevelopment site at Millbay.</p>
