      <h1>'I'd love this!' - Manchester United fans react to update on Aston Villa transfer target</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | Manchester United have become the latest club to be linked with the Leeds United midfielder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United fans have been having their say on links with Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was extensively linked with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> in the summer window as a number of Premier League clubs chased his signature.</p>
      <p>Phillips would ultimately sign a new deal at Elland Road, but that has done little to deter potential suitors from chasing the Leeds academy graduate.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-man-united-set-sights-on-leeds-duo/">Football Insider</a> have reported that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have been scouting Phillips and his Leeds teammate Ben White.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that talent spotters have been ‘blown away’ by Phillips’ performances, who continues to flourish under Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa.</p>
      <p>With less than two months to go until the window re-opens, here's how the red half of Manchester feel about making a move for Phillips.</p>

      <p><b>@SirMBusby: </b>Someone like Kalvin Phillips is what we need in the summer. Robust and simple with a brilliant range of passing and positional awareness.</p>
      <p><b>@MikeyBB12: </b>I'd love this to happen. Cantona all over. Kill Leeds off in January</p>
      <p><b>@NipunBakshi2</b>: Id take him if he turns out even half a bargain Daniel James is</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@AbdulKgafur: </b>Standards have fallen if we buying players from Championship</p>
      <p><b>@JamesScoging: </b>We’ve got enough ridiculous haircuts in our squad already so no thanks</p>
      <p><b>@TalbotGwinnell: </b>Be a class signing</p>
      <p><b>@lacey_kyle: </b>Id take him if he turns out even half a bargain Daniel James is</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@pfrances18: </b>Why couldn’t we buy him and then loan him back to Leeds for the rest of the season? We should have done this with Sessegnon when his contract was expiring!</p>
      <p><b>@Czyler_: </b>Make a choice between Florentino Luis and Kalvin Phillips</p>
      <p><b>@utdrobbo: </b>Whilst it would be the perfect January move for #mufc, I highly doubt a kid from Leeds would leave his boyhood club in the middle of a promotion push.</p>
