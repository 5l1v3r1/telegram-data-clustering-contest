      <p><b>Darcy Foster • Hyundai</b> has announced a major development in its <b>Active Noise Control</b> (ANC) technology.</p>
      <p>Rather than relying on traditional methods of sound insulation, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/">Hyundai’s</a> new Road Noise Active Noise Control (RANC) monitors cabin volume to adjust engine and road noise.</p>
      <p>The brand's current technology could only reduce noise when the sound coming in is constant and predictable, limiting its effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Hyundai says its new RANC system can discern between sounds to better counteract their intrusion in the cabin, such as tire noise or rumbles from the road surface.</p>
      <p>It uses a sensor to analyse the sound, before the speakers produce an inverted sound wave to keep levels at a minimum and prevent cabin disruption.</p>
      <p>A microphone constantly monitors its status to keep cancellation consistent.</p>

      <p>According to Hyundai, the RANC system was able to actively reduce cabin noise by up to 3dB, double what is possible with its current ANC.</p>
      <p>“RANC is a remarkable technology which takes existing NVH technology to the next level,” said Gangdeok Lee, a research fellow of the Hyundai NVH Research Lab.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to take the leading position of NVH technology and deliver the highest level of quietness to customers.”</p>
      <p>The development process for RANC has been a lengthy one, taking a total of six years with collaboration from the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, WeAcom, and BurnYoung.</p>
      <p>Hyundai says it will be particularly useful in electric and fuel cell vehicles (which don’t have a noisy internal-combustion engine drowning out wind and road noise) affording passengers near absolute silence.</p>
      <p>Hyundai has applied for domestic and American patents for the technology and if successful, mass production will be carried out by audio giant Harman.</p>

      <h3>A brief look at noise cancelling in the automotive world</h3>
      <p>The first car to utilise the tech was actually the <b>Nissan Bluebird</b>, way back in <b>1992.</b></p>
      <p>Nissan engineers fitted four microphones to the roof which analysed sound using a micro compressor, which then put out an inverted sound wave to counteract engine noise below 4000rpm – not unlike Hyundai’s new system.</p>
      <p>Its effectiveness was limited though, and it was another 20 years for the technology to be more comprehensively realised.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Bose began offering active noise-cancelling technology to its automotive partners, from humble Ford to luxury Mercedes-Benz.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the three-pointed star has also developed its own type of noise cancellation technology albeit for a different purpose.</p>
      <p>Coined Pre-Safe Sound, the audio system will blast a snippet of ‘pink noise’ in the event of an accident.</p>
      <p>In testing, Mercedes-Benz stated noise levels in the cabin at the point of impact were reportedly 80dB, half that of a vehicle without its cancellation technology.</p>
