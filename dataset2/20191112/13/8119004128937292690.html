        <b>The Anti-Corruption Commission has filed separate cases against expelled Jubo League leader Ismail Chowdhury Samrat and his aide Enamul Hoque Arman on charges of amassing illegal wealth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The cases were filed with the ACC's coordinated district office, Dhaka-1, on Tuesday, said Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya, the spokesman for the anti-graft body.</p>
      <p>Samrat, the former president of Jubo League’s Dhaka South unit, came under the scanner over his alleged ties to the illegal gambling business after the Rapid Action Battalion busted casino operations in numerous clubs in the capital in September.</p>
      <p>He subsequently went into hiding before being arrested along with Arman in Cumilla on October 6.</p>
      <p>The RAB later conducted a raid on Samrat’s office in Kakrail’s Bhuiyan Trade Centre with him in tow.</p>

      <p>They subsequently recovered a foreign pistol, 1,160 yaba tablets, 19 bottles of foreign liquor, two kangaroo hides and 'electrical torture equipment.'</p>

      <p>Two cases were also filed against him under the Narcotics Control Act and Arms Act with the Ramna Police Station.</p>
      <p>A court granted 10 days to grill Samrat in two separate cases involving illegal arms and drugs On Oct 15. Arman has been placed on a five-day remand in an arms case.</p>
