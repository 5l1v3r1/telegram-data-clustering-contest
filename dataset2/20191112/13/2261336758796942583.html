      <p>On Monday, Nick Diaz appeared on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUAlYvPjU4o">Ariel Helwani show</a>, staking claim to the “BMF” title. According to the elder Diaz, he <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20960257/nick-diaz-bmf-jorge-masvidal-nate-ufc-244-mma-news-ariel-helwani-dana-white-video">only gave way to his younger brother Nate</a>, who fought and lost to Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244 two weekends ago.</p>
      <p>Nick was also offended by Masvidal’s comments about “baptizing” Nate.</p>
      <p>“You want to talk about baptizing my younger brother? That’s on you,” Diaz said (via <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/11/20959933/ufc-nick-diaz-bmf-title-belongs-me-jorge-masvidal-baptize-brother-nate-diaz-mma">MMA Mania</a>). “I’ve never had nothing disrespectful to say but you don’t talk about baptizing my younger brother. So you are already in a f—d position if you fight with me.</p>
      <p>“You don’t talk about baptizing my younger brother. That’s my baby brother, you don’t talk like that to no one. So you want to say that, that’s on you. But who knows, ups and downs in life, I can relate to you. That’s why I ain’t mad at you.”</p>
      <p>Shortly after Diaz’s comments went online, Masvidal’s team issued a “super necessary” response via manager Malki Kawa’s Instagram account.</p>

      <p>Nick and “Gamebred” were supposed to face each other at UFC 235 last March. It would’ve marked Diaz’s return after a four-year absence, but the fight ended up falling through.</p>
