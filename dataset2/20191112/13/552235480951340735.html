      <h1>Scott Brown leaves Virgil van Dijk in stitches as Celtic skipper teases old pal after latest top award</h1>
      <h2>Brown loves a laugh but deadly serious when praising the player named the finest player in the world for Goal's 50 best in 2019 accolade.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:51:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Scott Brown and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/virgil-van-dijk">Virgil van Dijk</a> enjoyed a fun-filled reunion after Celtic's king prankster left his former team-mate in stitches with a video message</p>
      <p>The £75m <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender spent two seasons with the Parkhead side and the Hoops skipper teased the Dutchman on whether or not he remembered him.</p>
      <p>And while Brown loves a laugh, he was deadly serious when praising the player named the finest in the world for <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-bh/news/virgil-van-dijk-and-megan-rapinoe-win-goal-50-best-player/qgmapfu14jct10sa5vm5wpsvw">Goal</a> 's 50 best in 2019 accolade.</p>
      <p>But the 34-year-old couldn't resist a prank before dishing out the compliments.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> captain joked: "Hi Virgil, I'm Scott from Celtic, do you remember me?</p>
      <p>"I don't think anybody really knew too much about him but then two, three months into the season the lads were this guy is a player.</p>
      <p>"He just became the Rolls Royce of the team."</p>
      <p>And those sentiments were echoed by current Hoops boss Neil Lennon who managed van Dijk during his first season at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>He said: "He's the best in the world.</p>

      <p>"He could go on and play for any club now but I think he looks very happy at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>"And why wouldn't he be? Two <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> finals and a great Premier League run last year and another one this year."</p>
      <p>And the player himself detailed the vital role the Hoops played in helping him become recognised as the world's best defender.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk admitted: "Celtic, what a time!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"You look at the team before you arrive, and I think everyone knows Scott Brown anyway so before I arrived I was like 'how will he be?'</p>
      <p>"Will he be that crazy outside the pitch as he is on it?</p>

      <p>'At Celtic, if you draw, it's not good enough.</p>
      <p>"The game against Ajax in the Champions League in my first year the atmosphere was outstanding. It gives you that extra lift and it was very special."</p>
