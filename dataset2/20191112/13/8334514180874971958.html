      <p>Gervais, 58, has sharply divided opinion as host, taking direct aim at the Hollywood A-listers in the audience while helping to keep TV viewing figures highs.</p>
      <p>“Once again, they’ve made me an offer I can’t refuse,” Gervais said on Tuesday, announcing his return for the 77th edition of the award show, which honors television and film.</p>
      <p>“But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening.”</p>
      <p>Best known as the creator of TV mockumentary “The Office” and himself a three-time Golden Globe winner, Gervais first hosted the event in 2010.</p>
      <p>He caused outrage on his second appearance a year later, insulting organizers with jokes about bribes and taking pot-shots at Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie’s critically-panned movie “The Tourist”, which was on the list of award nominees.</p>
      <p>The president of event host the Hollywood Foreign Press Association said at the time that Gervais would not return.</p>
      <p>Paul Teledgy, chairman of NBC Entertainment, which airs the program, said Gervais’s reappearance on Jan. 5 meant viewers were in for an “unexpected evening”.</p>
      <p>“There is always a palpable electricity in the room when Ricky takes the Globes stage,” he said. “...We can’t wait to see what he has up his sleeve.”</p>
      <p>This year’s event, co-hosted by comedian Andy Samberg and actress Sandra Oh, reached an estimated 18.6 million viewers, organizers said.</p>
      <p>Gervais, who has also toured the world with his stand-up comedy show, hosted the Globes from 2010 to 2012 and again in 2016. “They must be mad,” he once said of his previous returns.</p>
