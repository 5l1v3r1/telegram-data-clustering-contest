      <p>Everything points to the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor being unveiled in early December. So, it’s time for us to start learning more about its specifications.</p>
      <p>This happens today thanks to the well-known Chinese leaker <a href="https://www.weibo.com/u/6048569942">Digital Chat Station</a>. This is often a credible source of this kind of information and once again used his Weibo social network account to let us know some of the specifications of the Snapdragon 865.</p>

      <p>As previous leaks suggested, the Snapdragon 865 will have eight processing cores and one Adreno 650 GPU. The Qualcomm’s new SoC will consist of a Cortex A77 core running at 2.84GHz and another three running at 2.42GHz. In addition, we will have four 1.8GHz Cortex A55 cores that will take on the less demanding tasks.</p>
      <p>This set of components and Samsung’s 7-nanometer EUV manufacturing process are expected to deliver a performance increase of around 20% compared to the Snapdragon 855, launched almost a year ago.</p>
      <p>In graphics terms, this new processor will feature the Adreno 650 GPU, which should offer you a 20% performance boost. It should also be noted that this processor will feature a 4G and 5G compatible version.</p>

      <h3>The first smartphone with the new SoC</h3>
      <p>It is true! Although <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a>‘s new top processor has not been introduced yet, some have already announced a smartphone with this SoC.</p>
      <p>The Chinese company 8848 was the first by revealing that its Titanium M6 5G will hit the market with the Snapdragon 865. It is an exclusive model in the Chinese market and at an exorbitant price.</p>
      <p>The first models to hit the masses with the SD 865 are expected to be by Samsung, Xiaomi and Sony, as was the case with the SD 855.</p>
