      <h1>General election: Former media executive who lent Boris Johnson £9.5m townhouse picked to run for Tories in safe seat</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:38:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Benjamin Kentish</a></address>
      <p>A former media executive who lent his Westminster mansion to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BorisJohnson">Boris Johnson</a> has been rewarded with a safe Conservative parliamentary seat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/andrew-griffith">Andrew Griffith</a>, who is now the prime minister's chief business adviser, was selected as the Tories' candidate in Arundel and South Downs, replacing retiring MP Nick Herbert.</p>
      <p>The seat is a Conservative stronghold and delivered a majority of almost 24,000 for the party in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffith, a former Sky executive, lent his £9.5m Westminster townhouse to Mr Johnson during this summer's Tory leadership campaign.</p>
      <p>He was later appointed as the new prime minister's business adviser and tasked with rebuilding relations with industry after Mr Johnson's infamous "f*** business" remark last year, when he was foreign secretary.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffith was previously the chief finance director and chief operating officer at Sky, having joined the company from the Rothschild bank in 1999.</p>
      <p>He ran as the Conservative candidate in Corby in the 2001 and 2005 general elections but lost to Labour on both occasions.</p>
      <p>Before joining Mr Johnson's team, he also served as a non-executive director at takeaway food company Just Eat.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson planned his first few months in government from Mr Griffith's five-story, Grade II-listed house and appointed him as an adviser within days of entering No10.</p>
      <p>Mr Griffith is all but certain to take over as the Arundel and South Downs MP on 12 December.</p>
      <p>Mr Herbert announced last week that he was standing down after 14 years in the role.</p>
      <p>He told his constituents: "I have decided not to stand again as the Parliamentary Candidate for Arundel and South Downs. This has been a difficult decision, but after nearly 15 years as MP for this wonderful constituency I feel that this is the right time to move on."</p>
      <p>Mr Griffith is the third of Mr Johnson's advisers to be selected in a safe Tory seat. One of the prime minister's deputy chiefs of staff, James Wild, is the candidate in North West Norfolk and his political secretary, Danny Kruger, will contest Devizes.​</p>
