      <p>Finally, after months of hype, <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/beey9">Disney+</a> is finally available for everyone to sign up and start watching.</p>
      <p>Disney+ is going to cost you just $6.99 per month, and considering the amount of content that Disney+ has available, that is an absolute steal. Most other streaming services are going to cost you at least $9.99 per month.</p>
      <p>Now if you already subscribe to Hulu and <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/college-football-games-espn-plus.html">ESPN+</a>, however, you can bundle all three for just $12.99 per month. That actually comes out to be about $5 cheaper than subscribing separately. Since Disney+ is $7, Hulu is $6 (it's the ad-supported version, unfortunately), and ESPN+ is $5, coming to a grand total of $18.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Just about everything that <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/beey9">Disney owns</a> is going to be available for streaming on Disney+ today. There are a few exceptions though, like the Spider-man movies. Since Sony owns distribution, those won't be on Disney+. And if they are on another streaming platform, they won't be on Disney+. Like Avengers: Infinity War. But, Avengers: End Game is available on Disney+ today.</p>
      <p>However there are still 16 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies available on Disney+ starting today. So if you're home for a snow day, like most of the midwest, you'll be able to have a nice Marvel marathon and watch some really great movies.</p>
      <p>Disney+ does allow you to download movies and TV shows to watch offline. However, you're going to want to check out the settings. As there are different qualities that you can download movies in. What's cool though, is that Disney+ can tell you how many hours you can store at each quality level, based on your available storage on your smartphone.</p>
