      <h1>Airplane Mode Simulates a Six-Hour Transatlantic Flight - in Real Time</h1>

      <p>If you've been pottering around certain corners of the internet for a few years, you may by aware of <i>Desert Bus</i>, a game which simulates a six-hour drive across the featureless Nevada/Arizona desert in real time. That game seemed like something of a one-off, a humorous test on the limits of human endurance. Except now, there's more.</p>
      <p>Last week, developer Hosni Auji and publisher AMC unveiled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/931310/Airplane_Mode/"><i>Airplane Mode</i></a>, a game which "delivers all the thrills of a real-time, six-hour commercial airline flight." from your window seat (in economy, naturally), you'll experience everything from taxi and take-off all the way through to landing.</p>

      <p>To help you while away the hours, you'll have plenty to keep you entertained. Your carry-on contains a book and headphones, and you'll be able to read through the in-flight magazine (and complete its sudokus and crosswords) with the pen you brought on-board too. There is an entertainment system, but copyright law means you shouldn't expect any recent blockbusters. Instead, you'll be able to catch up on the "hit movie of the 1930s."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, air travel isn't as relaxing as all airline marketing execs would have you believe, and <i>Airplane Mod</i>e also captures everything you hate about flying. From turbulence to delays to crying babies, each playthrough will feature random events to ensure you'll never want to set foot in a real-life airport again.</p>
      <p>The game will be fully revealed during the annual Desert Bus for Hope charity steam (currently underway on <a href="https://desertbus.org/">Twitch</a>), but if, for some reason, you want to undergo this hellish experience for yourself, you'll have to wait until the game arrives on Steam next year.</p>
