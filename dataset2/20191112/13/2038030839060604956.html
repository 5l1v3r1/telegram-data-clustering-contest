      <p>Cape Town - The 93-year-old monarch is said to have quite a witty sense of humour but her unexpected response to resuscitation will leave you in complete awe.</p>
      <p>While Queen Elizabeth was in the great outdoors for a pheasant shoot – a popular sport in the United Kingdom carried out using a shotgun to hunt game birds – one of her protection officers thought she’d been shot and gave her mouth-to-mouth, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1202854/queen-elizabeth-ii-news-royal-family-prince-philip-buckingham-palace-jokes-spt"><b>Express UK</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Karen Dolby writes in her book <i>The Wicked Wit of Queen Elizabeth II</i>, that the queen was sitting for a painting with artist Lucian Freud when she revealed the story of how she was jumped by her protection officers and was hilariously given mouth-to-mouth.</p>
      <p>"I was picking up after the guns as I always do when a wounded cock pheasant scratched me and drew blood," Karen writes in the book of the queen recalling the moment, the <a href="https://www.thesun.ie/fabulous/4763641/the-queens-protection-officer-once-mistakenly-thought-shed-been-shot-and-started-mouth-to-mouth-resuscitation/"><b>Sun</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>"The detective assumed I’d been shot, threw himself on top of me and began to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</p>
      <p>"To which the queen comically added, 'I consider we got to know each other rather well.'."</p>
      <p>Well, that’s definitely one way of getting to know the queen.</p>
