      <p>Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados/">iPadOS</a> 13.3 updates to developers, one week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/apple-seeds-ios-13-3-beta-1-to-developers/">seeding the first beta</a> and two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-releases-ios-13-2/">release of iOS 13.2</a> with new emoji, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> privacy controls, Deep Fusion, and more. <br/><br/>iOS and ‌‌‌iPadOS‌‌‌ 13.3 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or over the air after the proper developer profile has been installed.</p>

      <p>iOS 13.3 introduces <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/ios-13-3-communication-limits/">Communication Limits</a> for Screen Time, a feature that Apple promised would be coming in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-13/">iOS 13</a> update. Communication Limits allow parents to control who their children are able to contact both during downtime and during Screen Time. <br/><br/>Communication Limits include FaceTime, Phone, and Messages, along with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/icloud/">iCloud</a> contacts. Calls to emergency numbers are always allowed and will turn off communication limits for 24 hours when placed. <br/><br/>The iOS 13.3 update also appears to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/ios-13-3-multitasking-bug-fix/">address a multitasking issue</a> where iOS 13.2 users were seeing poor RAM management that caused apps like YouTube and Safari to reload more frequently than normal. <br/><br/>After installing iOS 13.3, affected users are now seeing fewer refreshes when accessing these apps, doing another task, and then opening them again. <br/><br/>In the Keyboards section of the Settings app (under General), there's a new toggle that prevents Animoji and Memoji stickers from being displayed as an option on the Emoji Keyboard, and when editing a video, there's an option to save the edited version as a new clip rather than saving over the original. <br/><br/>Apple has also tweaked the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a> app icon, changing the color of the Digital Crown from black to gray.</p>
