      <h1>Star Wars fans furious as Disney 'lets UK down' with new series The Mandalorian</h1>
      <h2>The Mandalorian won't be on UK screens until next year but has just debuted in the US on Disney+. Star Wars fans in the UK are not very happy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:38:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The Mandalorian is finally released into the world today - just not in the UK.</p>
      <p>The flagship series for new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/disney">Disney</a> streaming service Disney+ is set after the events of the original <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/star-wars">Star Wars</a> trilogy but before the latest sequel films.</p>
      <p>After the stories of previous Mandalorian bounty hunters Jango and Boba Fett, another figure emerges in the Star Wars universe.</p>
      <p>The series depicts a lone gunfighter played by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> and Narcos star Pedro Pascal, in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic.</p>
      <p>The cast also includes the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gina-joy-carano">Gina Carano</a> as Cara Dune, a former Rebel Shock Trooper-turned-mercenary who worked for the Rebel Alliance, alongside <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/breaking-bad">Breaking Bad</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/giancarlo-esposito">Giancarlo Esposito</a> as Moff Gideon, a former governor under the Galactic Empire.</p>
      <p>However, while the first episode in the series was released today (November 12) in the US, with the eight-part series released in instalments on the streaming platform over the coming weeks, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/disney-plus-uk-launch-date-20839267">UK fans won't be getting the show until March 31, 2020.</a></p>

      <p>As you can imagine, UK Star Wars fans are not happy bunnies and took to social media to vent their frustration.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> :  "Nooooo. So want to watch #TheMandalorian but its not in the UK till March. Grrrrr."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I will impatiently wait until the UK Disney+ launch in March, but this situation with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheMandalorian">#TheMandalorian</a> is absolutely mind-boggling."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, one fan captioned a gif in a tweet: I love <a href="https://twitter.com/Disney/">@Disney</a> , I really do, but why can’t they show <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheMandalorian">#TheMandalorian</a> SOMEWHERE in the UK instead of making us wait until March for <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/">@disneyplus</a> ?</p>
      <p>Another just couldn't handle the emotions: "Dear America. I'm definitely suffering from sever PMJD today... Post Mandalorian Jealousy Disorder Love From a UK Star Wars fan"</p>
      <p>One just used a gif of Brian Cox as Logan Roy in Succession to say: "F**k off" to seeing The Mandalorian trending in but not being available in the UK.</p>
      <p>Finally, one wrote: "Everyone living in the UK today interested in <a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/">@starwars</a> and waiting for mid-2020 when Disney+ arrives. Mid-2020? Are you freaking kidding me?"</p>
      <p>Good luck avoiding spoilers, everyone!</p>
