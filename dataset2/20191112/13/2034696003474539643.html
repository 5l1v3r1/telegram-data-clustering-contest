        <b>"Sounds like it starts with you, Dan"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The cast of NBC sitcom <i>Community</i> have said they’ll return to the show if creator Dan Harmon writes a movie.</p>
      <p>The cast held a reunion this week (November 10) as part of the Vulture Festival.</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>Attending the panel were cast members Joel McHale, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Jim Rash, Yvette Nicole Brown, Ken Jeong alongside writers Chris McKenna and Dan Harmon – basically everyone who worked on and starred in the show minus Donald Glover – aka <a href="http://nme.com/artists/childish-gambino">Childish Gambino</a> – to talk about their memories and favourite moments from the series.</p>
      <p>Across <i>Community</i>‘s tenure on screens, the somewhat joke tagline of “six seasons and a movie” has been said time and time again, and was brought up during the talk when the moderator asked what it would take in order for a <i>Community</i> film to be made. “One million dollars for Donald [Glover],” McHale replied.</p>

      <p>Dan Harmon then responded, saying: “Who’s supposed to say ‘everyone do this?’ That’s what I’ve always said. How does it happen?”</p>
      <p>“Sounds like it starts with you, Dan,” Alison Brie responded, before Harmon imagined a scenario where he wrote the script before the cast ended up backing out. As <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/community-cast-reunion-movie-vulture-festival.html"><i>Vulture</i></a> report, the cast’s response to this was to publicly attach themselves to the idea of a <i>Community</i> movie.</p>
      <p>The new commitment follows <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/alison-brie-community-film-up-for-it-2096250">Alison Brie claiming that she was “up for” a <i>Community</i> film</a> back in 2017, and that it could happen “in a few years”.</p>
      <p>But there was less excitement for the idea of Chevy Chase’s return, after he was accused of making racially-motivated digs at <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/Donald-Glover">Donald Glover</a> during the filming of the show.</p>
      <p>According to a 2017 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/donald-glover-cant-save-you"><i>New Yorker</i> profile</a> about Glover, veteran co-star Chase “often tried to disrupt his scenes and made racial cracks between takes”.</p>
      <p>Harmon described the actor as a “self-described legend,” and said that much of the dialogue for Chase’s character Pierce Hawthorne – who often made ill-advised comments – stemmed  from meetings in Chase’s trailer.</p>
