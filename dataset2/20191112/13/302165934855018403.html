      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 12 — During commercial breaks in a broadcast of World Wrestling Entertainment’s WWE SmackDown, fans were shown ads for Walt Disney Co’s new streaming service, Disney+. So were “Monday Night Football” viewers and video gamers watching Twitch.</p>
      <p>“Try to keep up,” said Captain Marvel in one ad after a series of fast-paced clips from <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i>, <i>The Avengers</i> and other Disney-owned hits from outside of its deep catalogue of children’s classics.</p>
      <p>Disney’s marketing force is reaching beyond its traditional family audience to send a message that its US$7-a-month (RM29) subscription service Disney+ offers something for all ages. The service debuted today in the United States, Canada and The Netherlands.</p>
      <p>“It’s incumbent upon us to market it the right way to emphasise the fact that it’s not just for kids,” Disney executive Kevin Mayer said during a briefing at the company’s Burbank, California, headquarters. “It’s all family friendly, but everyone can enjoy this product.”</p>
      <p>Disney has told investors it can hook 60 million to 90 million customers within about five years as it competes for customers in a crowded streaming market dominated by Netflix Inc.</p>
      <p>Signing up adults who do not have children at home is part of that plan.</p>
      <p>Consumers may not realise that after a series of acquisitions Disney is much more than classics like <i>Cinderella</i> and <i>Mary Poppins</i> that charmed generations of families. The company now owns the celebrated <i>Star Wars </i>movie franchise; Iron Man, the Hulk and dozens of other Marvel superheroes; <i>Toy Story</i> animation house Pixar, and nature programming channel National Geographic.</p>
      <p>Previously released movies and TV series from all of those brands, plus 30 seasons of <i>The Simpsons</i>, are available on Disney+ alongside decades of Disney’s family-centric offerings.</p>
      <p>Disney+ also offers new programming from those brands.</p>
      <p>To raise awareness, the company is promoting Disney+ during sports and primetime TV telecasts to get in front of what Hollywood calls the four quadrants of viewers: Male, female, young and old.</p>
      <p>“We’re unmatched in quality and appeal across our four-quadrant audience spanning a variety of genres, formats and arenas, and will continue to build on that year after year,” said Ricky Strauss, president of content and marketing for Disney+.</p>
      <p>In addition to the wrestling, football and gaming contests, ads ran during the World Series and the ABC News late-night programme <i>Nightline</i>, and on social media networks.</p>
      <p>Early testing in The Netherlands, where Disney offered a free two-month trial of Disney+, attracted a “very large and diverse audience”, said Mayer, who runs Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international unit.</p>
      <p><i>Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD</i>, a series aimed at 18- to 49-year-olds, ranked as the most-watched piece of content, Mayer said. Next was tween-oriented show <i>The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody</i> followed by <i>Disney’s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</i>, a cartoon for young children.</p>
      <p>“Our hypothesis was we will have a lot of different types of viewership, that it’s not going to be centred among any one of our brands,” Mayer said. “It’s quite a nice confirmation of what we want accomplished.”</p>
      <p>The initial response in The Netherlands has cheered industry analysts.</p>
      <p>“They have some surprising and encouraging signs about this potential that Disney+ is not just kids and family,” Forrester analyst Jim Nail said.</p>
      <p>But unlike Netflix, Disney+ limits how far its programming will go to attract older viewers. To keep it family friendly, the service will not have any R-rated movies or TV shows designated TV-MA for mature audiences.</p>
      <p>Programming considered too adult for Disney+ may stream on Hulu, which Disney also owns. That will include FX series such as <i>American Horror Story</i> and <i>Fargo</i> and possibly movies starring <i>Deadpool</i>, a Marvel character known for foul-mouthed humour, when rights become available.</p>
      <p>“There are boundaries to what we’ll put on Disney+,” Mayer said. “<i>Deadpool</i> is definitely not for Disney+.” — Reuters</p>
