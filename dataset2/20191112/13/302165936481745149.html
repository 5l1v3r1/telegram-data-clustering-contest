      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 12 — <i>California Snow</i> will appear during the closing credits for the upcoming film <i>Spell</i>, which will arrive in select US theatres November 15 and on-demand services on November 19.</p>
      <p>This dark comedy thriller stars Barak Hardley as a grieving American illustrator who goes on a soul-searching journey in the Icelandic countryside after the sudden death of his fiancee (portrayed by Jackie Tohn).</p>
      <p>As he runs out of medication, he quickly wonders whether his compulsions are related to his mental disorder or if he is drawn into the supernatural world of ancient runes.</p>

      <p>Ahead of the film release, Weezer have unveiled the accompanying music video for <i>California Snow</i>, which was helmed by <i>Spell</i> star and director Brendan Walter.</p>
      <p>The visual features footage from the upcoming movie, along with scenes in which Walter is trying to overcome his grief with a deranged therapist portrayed by Adam DeVine.</p>
      <p>Although the actor does not star in <i>Spell</i>, he takes centre stage in the video for <i>California Snow</i>, furiously playing bongos bare-chested and forcing his patient to sing along with him in a bizarre therapy session.</p>
      <p>“Back in 30 minutes, high as I can get it/Give me everything you got/I could move a mountain, solve a thorny problem/Lava’s gonna flow so hot,” Rivers Cuomo sings over an electro pop-rock beat.</p>
      <p>The Weezer frontman also makes a cameo in <i>Spell</i> as Hardley’s seemingly unreachable psychiatrist. Cuomo is not the only musician involved in the project, as the film has been scored by Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump.</p>
      <p>In addition to <i>California Snow</i>, Weezer has recently shared the single <i>End of the Game</i>, which is slated to appear on their forthcoming new album.</p>
      <p><i>Van Weezer</i> will mark the band’s 14th studio effort, following their 2019 releases <i>Teal Album</i> and <i>Black Album</i>, which includes the track <i>California Snow</i>.</p>
      <p>Next summer, Weezer will embark on the “Hella Mega Tour” with Green Day and Fall Out Boy, whose North American leg will kick off on July 17 in Seattle.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, discover the music video for <i>California Snow</i>. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
