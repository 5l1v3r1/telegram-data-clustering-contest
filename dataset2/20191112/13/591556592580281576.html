      <p>Another day, another iOS bug. Apple's iOS 13.2.2 update, which was pushed out <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-13-has-a-huge-bug-that-makes-me-want-to-dump-my-iphone-and-ipad/">to fix a bug that essentially broke multitasking on the iPhone and iPad</a>, has itself bought a new and annoying bug to the iPhone.<br/><br/>A few hours after installing iOS 13.2.2, I noticed <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-13-2-2-does-it-fix-the-multitasking-problem-does-it-bring-new-bugs/">that battery life had gone from good to appalling</a>. Rather than jump to conclusions, I decided to wait until my devices had gone through a few recharge cycles before calling this an issue.<br/><br/>It appears to be an issue.<br/><br/><b>Must read: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/eight-things-i-love-about-ios/"><b>Eight things I love about iOS</b></a><br/><br/>Bottom line, battery life has gone from great to terrible. The initial iOS 13 release wasn't too bad, but the iOS 13.1.2 release had a serious battery bug. While this bug was subsequently fixed, this latest release seems to bring back this bug. Battery life is now so bad that I can watch my battery life ticking down while I'm browsing the web, composing an email, or using Twitter.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, background battery life -- when the device is locked and not being used -- is not too bad. Also, while not as bad, iPadOS 13.2.2 battery life is also much worse than post iPadOS 13.1.2 releases.</p>
      <p>The problem doesn't seem to be down to specific apps, but instead seems to be a widespread operating system problem.</p>

Here's how to diagnose and fix battery drain issues</b></a><br/><br/>I've tested iOS 13.2.2 on multiple devices, with similar results.<br/><br/>Social media is also awash with similar complaints:</p>
