      <p>Frederic Guilbert has been lavishly praised, from one of the men he has replaced.</p>
      <p>The Aston Villa defender has been in fine form this season, after signing in January, the Frenchman ended the season at his beloved Caen as he tried, unsuccessfully to battle against relegation.</p>
      <p>Alan Hutton was the man that occupied the right back slot at Villa Park for much of the promotion season, until an injury all but ended his final season as a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> player.</p>

      <p>The former Scotland international left the club in the summer, but has been able to watch his replacement flourish in his fledgling Premier League career.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Football Insider, Hutton said: “He’s done well since he’s come in, good pace which helps out, especially in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>“You need to be quick, especially playing against some of these players and it’s going to be difficult, you’re going to have difficult times but he’s handled himself well.</p>
      <p>“Not only that, he’s got himself forward, he’s been involved in the attacking play as well. He looks very good, he looks like a good player that’s come in and done well. Hopefully, he can build on that, continue to play well and go from strength to strength. I really like him as a player.”</p>

      <p>Guilbert is walking a disciplinary tightrope in the coming weeks. After picking up his fourth booking of the season in the defeat at Wolves, he must now navigate the next seven fixtures without picking up a card, if he is to avoid a one-match ban.</p>
      <p>It is an area of game that will be pinpointed for improvement, the 24-year-old has picked up a staggering 25 cautions since the start of the 2017/18 season.</p>
