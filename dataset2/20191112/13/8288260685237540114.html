      <p>Other discounts include a Lego Advent Calendar building set for £17 - now down to £13.60 using the code.</p>
      <p>However, a deal offering an extra £15 off means the Barbie House is now an incredible £33, while the Lego Advent Calendar is now completely free using the two discount deals.</p>
