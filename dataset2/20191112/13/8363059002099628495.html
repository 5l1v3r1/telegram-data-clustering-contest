      <h1>Poor Children Priced Out of Getting Touched by Harrods' Santa</h1>

      <p>The kids of the many will have to be happy with <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/mariah-carey-overload-imminent-as-walkers-makes-her-the-face-of-christmas-crisps/">a packet of crisps for Christmas</a> handed over by a shop assistant wearing a seasonally coloured SPAR hat, as the fortunate children of the super-rich few are the only ones allowed to enjoy a visit with Santa in the privacy of the Harrods grotto.</p>
      <p>The upmarket department store for people who do not shop around has installed a basic limit of £2,000 on the amount that must be spent in-store before their children qualify to visit the old man who's pretending to be Santa. Like, some people spend £2,000 in one shop, and don't emerge with a car or deposit for a flat in return. That's their <i>usual shopping</i> <i>bill</i>. Oh but there's more too. The families who do somehow blow £2,000 on hams and jumpers and candy canes with edible gold leaf horn handle detailing and whatnot must then spend a further £20 to book an appointment with Santa.</p>
      <p>A Harrods spokesperson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/08/harrods-restricts-christmas-grotto-to-2000-plus-spenders">told the Guardian</a> that the minimum spend floor has been introduced as a way of limiting demand, and it's not wrong. Thousands of posh people have still <a href="https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/christmas-grotto">booked it out</a> already though. There's no saying no to little Charlie. He's already being taught he gets what he wants because of grandad's money. [<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/harrods-closes-off-christmas-grotto-customers-spend-less-2000-11077762/">Metro</a>]</p>
