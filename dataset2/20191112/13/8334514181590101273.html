      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors on Tuesday sought charges against a current Volkswagen (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VOWG_p.DE">VOWG_p.DE</a>) manager as well as a former manager and two former board members, accusing them of awarding works council members inflated salaries.</p>
      <p>The Braunschweig prosecutor said that managers responsible for personnel issues stand accused of a breach of fiduciary trust for awarding salary and bonus awards which caused damages worth 5.05 million euros ($5.57 million).</p>
      <p>A court must now decide whether the accusations, made by the prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, will be brought before a judge.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Volkswagen on Tuesday said that there had been no misconduct in relation to deciding appropriate salary levels for works council representatives.</p>
      <p>Under Germany’s two-tier board system, workers have seats on the company’s board of directors, with broad powers to veto sweeping strategy decisions.</p>
      <p>Upon deciding which level of salary to award works council members, members of VW’s personnel committee deliberately inflated pay by choosing to benchmark peers in a higher salary band, ensuring that VW’s labor leaders got a pay rise, the prosecutor’s office said.</p>
      <p>Between 2011 and 2016 five members of the works council received excess pay, with 3.125 million euros awarded to the works council chief, the prosecutor’s office said.</p>
      <p>Such awards were to the “disadvantage” of the company, the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office said.</p>
