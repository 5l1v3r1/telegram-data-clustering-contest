      <p>Cape Town - A new trailer for the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> movie was released on Tuesday, and it features a redesigned titular character.</p>
      <p>This comes after the film’s director took critic on board and made some much-needed changes after the initial trailer was released in earlier <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/5-new-movie-trailers-you-may-have-missed-this-week-20190503"><b>this year.</b></a></p>
      <p>Writing about the trailer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/12/new-trailer-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-released-after-disastrous-first-version"><b>The Guardian’s Keith Stuart</b></a> said the cartoon character: "resembles a cheap knock-off Sonic toy your child might win at a fairground stand and then be terrified of".</p>
      <p>The film features Jim Carrey as Dr Robotnik alongside the animated character and about the particularly nasty backlash, Jeff Fowler, the film’s director, tweeted: "The message is loud and clear... you aren’t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It’s going to happen."</p>
