      <h1>India Ratings cuts JSW Steel outlook, says liquidity will rise in FY20</h1>

      <p>India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) has affirmed JSW Steel Limiteds long-term issuer rating to IND AA and revised the company's outlook to negative from stable.</p>
      <p>The rating on the company's Rs 53.51 billion NCD was also revised.</p>
      <p>The outlook revision reflects Ind-Ra's view of a higher-than-expected fall in per tonne EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) and consequent deterioration in JSW Steel's credit profile in FY'20.</p>
      <p>JSW has announced reduction in the budgeted capital expenditure by about Rs 47 billion to about Rs 110 billion in FY'20 as a measure to conserve cash in the background of the current economic situation.</p>
      <p>The company has also deferred capex at its Baytown facility in the US by around USD 240 million of the announced USD 500 million.</p>
      <p>The rating agency expects outflows relating to any inorganic stressed asset acquisition in FY20 to be limited to Rs 50 billion and would primarily be executed through ring- fenced financial structures with only a minority stake by JSW Steel.</p>
      <p>However, Ind-Ra expects the FY20 liquidity to remain adequate with well-planned debt refinancing amid substantial capital expenditure outflows by the company.</p>
      <p>The agency highlights JSW Steel's significant cost advantage as the company benefits from locational advantages, low manpower costs and operational efficiencies.</p>
      <p>"The company has a dominant market share in southern and western India. JSW strategic partnership with JFE Steel Corporation (Japan) for technology underpins the companys efforts to develop value-added products," Ind-Ra said in its rating note.</p>
