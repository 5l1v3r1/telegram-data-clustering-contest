      <p>Cape Town – The Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences has disqualified another best international feature Oscar consideration.</p>
      <p>This comes after it barred Nigeria's first-ever Oscar submission, <i>Lionheart</i>, last week because it is a predominantly English language film.</p>

      <p>The film written and directed by Sudabeh Mortezai centres Joy a Nigerian woman caught in the cycle of sex trafficking.

      <p>The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2018 and is available to stream on Netflix. In 2018 it won the Best Film Award at the London Film Festival. </p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the Academy said in a statement that "the film was reviewed and found ineligible because only 33 percent of the dialogue is non-English", reports <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/joy-austria-oscar-disqualified-too-much-english-sudabeh-mortezai-1203400543/"><b>Variety</b></a>.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "Another one. How about letting countries submit the film they feel best represents its cinematic work in any given year? I'm really asking. There has to be a good reason for not. I want to understand, @TheAcademy. I know when the no English rule originated. But why? Please share."</p>
      <p>Oscar nominations will be announced on Monday, 13 January 2020. The ceremony will take place on Sunday, 9 February.</p>
