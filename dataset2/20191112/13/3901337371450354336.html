      <p>The search for a new coach is ongoing for one of the Absa Premiership clubs that recently parted ways with their mentor.</p>
      <p>Following a string of poor results in recent matches, Polokwane City relieved Serbian coach Zlatko Krmpotic of his coaching duties at the club last Friday.</p>

      <p>Bernard Molekwa, who has been Krmpotic’s assistant and Rise and Shine team manager, took charge of the team’s match against Baroka FC in the Limpopo derby on the weekend.</p>
      <p>Rise and Shine lost 1-0 against Bakgaga at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. The indication from sources is that the club is seeking a replacement outside the borders of South Africa.</p>

      <p>“The search for a new coach for Polokwane City is in progress. The club is looking for their man from outside of the country. The club is likely to appoint a foreign coach again if they succeed in their search,” said the source.</p>
      <p>Krmpotic had replaced Slovakian coach Jozef Vukusic at Rise and Shine, when he took over the reins at the start of the season.  </p>
