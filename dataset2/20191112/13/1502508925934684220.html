      <p>The lawyer said the SC registry informed that it will "not be possible to constitute a bench today".</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>has asked us to mention the writ petition that we filed at 10.30 AM on Wednesday before the court," Advocate Sunil Fernandes, who filed the petition on behalf of the Shiv Sena, told PTI.</p>
