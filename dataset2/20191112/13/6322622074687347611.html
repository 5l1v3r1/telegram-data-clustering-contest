      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): UEM Sunrise Bhd is disposing of a property in Melbourne for A$107.09 million (RM304.13 million).</p>
      <p>The group said its wholly-owned subsidiary UEM Sunrise (St Kilda Road) Pty Ltd (acting as a trustee and on behalf of UEM Sunrise (St Kilda Road) Unit Trust), is selling the asset to Acme Co. No 4 Pty Ltd.</p>
      <p>“The proposed divestment allows UEM Sunrise to immediately unlock the value of the property at a gain in line with market value, and free up the cash to enable the group to pursue other investments and venture opportunities.” it added in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The disposal, it added, is expected to be completed by the end of the year and give rise to an estimated net gain on disposal of RM54.32 million (A$19.12 million).</p>
      <p>UEM Sunrise said the property was acquired in May 2016 for A$58 million.</p>
      <p>The property is located at a strategic corner site of St Kilda Road and Bowens Crescent, one of the main arteries into the Melbourne Central Business District and flanked by a mix of office, residential and mixed-use towers.</p>
      <p>The site currently accommodates a 21-storey building with panoramic views overlooking the Royal Botanic Gardens to the north, Fawkner Park to the north-east and Albert Park, as well as Port Philip Bay to the south and south western aspects, according to the group.</p>
      <p>Shares price of UEM Sunrise closed half a sen or 0.66% lower at 75 sen today, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM3.4 billion.</p>
