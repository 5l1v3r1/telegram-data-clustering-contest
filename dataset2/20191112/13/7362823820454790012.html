      <p>Anthony Rocco Martin picked up his 17th professional victory Saturday at UFC Fight Night 163, but it wasn’t his victory that was being talked about after the match.</p>
      <p>Martin dedicated his unanimous-decision victory over Ramazan Emeev to his mother, who has been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. Martin gave a heartfelt speech after his fight, which left no dry eyes in the building.</p>

      <p>“Most importantly, this is my 14th UFC fight and I never dedicated a fight to anyone,” Martin said. “And I just want to tell a woman in my life that’s really special to me.</p>
      <p>“And this woman, I never tell her how much I love her and how much she means to me. She just got diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. She means the world to me and I want to tell her how much I love her. So, mom, I love you. Get that bucket list ready. Let’s go out with one hell of a bang.”</p>

      <p>Martin has been fighting in UFC since 2014 and his career with the promotion started off a bit slow as he dropped three of his first four fights.</p>

      <p>However, five wins in his last six fights since April 2018 has him back on track. The 29-year-old welterweight could be lining up for a UFC main-card bout next year.</p>
