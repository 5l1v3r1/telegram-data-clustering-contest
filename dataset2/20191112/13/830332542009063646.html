      <h1>Montgomery, Alabama, will swear in its first black mayor</h1>
      <h2>City is cradle of civil rights movement</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:15:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Hanna, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Alabama's capital city, a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/us/montgomery-alabama-makes-history/index.html">hub of the civil rights movement</a> decades ago, is about to gain the first African-American mayor in its 200-year history.</p>
      <p>Steven Reed will be inaugurated as mayor of Montgomery in a ceremony late Tuesday morning at the Montgomery Performing Arts Center.</p>
      <p>Reed, a Montgomery County probate judge, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/us/montgomery-alabama-makes-history/index.html">won an October runoff</a> to replace Mayor Todd Strange, who did not run for reelection after holding office since 2009.</p>
      <p>It's a historic moment for Alabama's second-largest city, which has a complicated racial history. A cradle of important civil rights events, it also was the <a href="https://visitingmontgomery.com/play/first-white-house-of-the-confederacy">first capital of the Confederacy</a> early in the Civil War, and many streets and schools still bear Confederate names.</p>
      <p>Montgomery was the site of Rosa Parks' <a href="https://civilrightstrail.com/destination/montgomery/">famed bus boycott in 1955 </a>and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s <a href="https://civilrightstrail.com/attraction/dexter-avenue-baptist-church/">Dexter Avenue Baptist Church</a>, as well as the destination of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/15/us/1965-selma-to-montgomery-march-fast-facts/index.html">1965 Selma-to-Montgomery protest marches</a> that were met with brutal police violence and led to the Voting Rights Act.</p>
      <p>The nation's first memorial for more than 4,000 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/us/montgomery-alabama-makes-history/index.html">victims of lynchings</a> opened there last year. About 60% of the city's residents are black.</p>
      <p>Reed, born and raised in Montgomery, told CNN after his victory last month that while a number of factors delayed the city's election of a black mayor, it's now time to move forward.</p>
      <p>"We've been unified on the message of opportunity and creating an environment where people can live, learn and earn," Reed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/us/montgomery-alabama-mayor-new-day-cnntv/index.html">said</a>.</p>
      <p>In Reed's first 100 days in office, he wants to focus on public education and restoring trust between the police and the community, two issues he ran on, he told CNN.</p>
      <p>"We want to let everyone know that this is a new Montgomery," Reed said. "This is a new day, and we're going to be a great part and a great asset to this country."</p>
