      <h1>The year 2019 has been a learning year for me: Harikrishna</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:11:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Prasad-RS-479236858.cms" target="_blank">Prasad RS</a></address>
      <p>CHENNAI: Grandmaster <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/P-Harikrishna">P Harikrishna</a> - along with Vidit Gujrathi - may have the tag of wildcards at the upcoming <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Grand-Chess-Tour">Grand Chess Tour</a> leg of Kolkata but one will take them lightly at their own peril.</p>
      <p>Harikrishna, who finished second in the rapid event of Tata Steel chess in Kolkata behind <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hikaru-Nakamura">Hikaru Nakamura</a>, is understandably excited at the prospect of featuring in the tournament once again. "I had a good tournament last year and it will be nice to be back in action against the top players in the world," Harikrishna told TOI.</p>
      <p>With wildcards such as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anton-Korobov">Anton Korobov</a> - in Bucharest leg of GCT - giving a good account of themselves, Harikrishna seems to be deriving some confidence from their show. "It is a good sign. But me and Vidit have both featured at the Tata Steel chess last year, and rapid &amp; blitz events often produce surprising results," added Hari, who has been associated with Chessable.com.</p>
      <p>Hari will be hoping for a good show in Kolkata after having witnessed a fair share of highs and lows this year. He finished a close second behind <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anish-Giri">Anish Giri</a> at the Shenzhen Masters in China in April and followed it up with another second-placed finish at the Tepe Sigeman event held in Malmo, Sweden.</p>
      <p>Hari also took part in the French League and Polish League. If the first half of the year went as per plan, the second half necessarily didn't. Hari endured ordinary outings at the World Cup and Grand Swiss event in Isle of Man.</p>
      <p>"The year 2019 has been a learning year for me. I have learned that I can make comebacks and win against the top players in the game. I did well in Shenzhen and in Tepe Sigeman but didn't have the best of World Cup and Grand Swiss," said Hari, who is currently featuring at European club cup for AVE Novy Bor. Hari will be keen on finishing the year on a high.</p>
