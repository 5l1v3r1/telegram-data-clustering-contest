      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ant-mcpartlin">Anthony McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> have discovered they are distant cousins after appearing on the documentary <i>Ant and Dec’s DNA Journey.</i></p>
      <p>The long-time collaborators traced their ancestral history throughout the two-part series, which ended on Monday night (11 November). </p>
      <p>In the final part of the show, it was revealed that the pair share the same DNA marker S660, meaning they must be related. </p>
      <p>The presenters also share the same Viking warrior descendant through their fathers' bloodlines.</p>
      <p>A genealogist explained: “There’s only one way to share a DNA marker – and that’s because you’re related.</p>
      <p>“Recently, a Viking age warrior’s Skelton has been dug up in Dublin. He was in his late 20s, and died over 1000 years ago.   </p>
      <p>“What’s amazing to me is that when his DNA was analysed, it was shown he carried the S660 marker – the same marker that Ant and Dec carry.  </p>
      <p>“This warrior is directly related to them, in the father line. He’s the first one warrior we’ve ever found in the world with the S660.”</p>
      <p>On hearing the news, McPartlin said: “Its been two years, we started out in Newcastle and here we are now… cousins!”</p>
      <p> “Oh my God!” added Donnelly.</p>
      <p>McPartlin, who recently took a break from his television commitments due to an addiction to subscription painkillers and his conviction for drink-driving in 2018, said his friendship with Donnelly “feels even deeper” than it did before. </p>
      <p>The pair are reuniting to launch the new series of<i> I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! </i>on Sunday 17 November on ITV. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/im-a-celebrity-2019-lineup-cast-ant-dec-australia-jungle-contestant-list-caitlyn-jenner-itv-a9197851.html">Check out the full line-up here.</a></p>
