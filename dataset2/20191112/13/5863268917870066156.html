      <h1>Court rejects Zardari's application for treatment in Karachi</h1>

      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – An accountability court in Islamabad on Tuesday rejected former president Asif Ali Zardari’s application seeking his transfer to Karachi for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, the court extended Zardari and his sibling Faryal Talpur’s judicial remand till November 26 in the money laundering through fake bank accounts case.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor presented his arguments in the courtroom as the court resumed hearing.</p>
      <p>“Zardari was shifted to the hospital upon recommendation of a medical board formed by the government […] filing an application with the government is not begging,” the prosecutor stated.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor further asked whether the former president was transferred to the hospital due to begging.</p>
      <p>“The situation is not like this […] now seeking recommendation of the same medical board and the government is being interpreted as begging,” he argued.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the court extended judicial remand of both PPP leaders till Nov. 26 and asked the accountability watchdog to produce them again in the court upon expiry of the remand.</p>
