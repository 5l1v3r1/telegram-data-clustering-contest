      <p>In New South Wales alone there are 60 fires, 40 of which are are considered out of control.</p>

      <p>It read: "It was our pleasure to save your house. Sorry that we could not save your sheds. Urunga RFS. p.s. - we owe you some milk."</p>
      <p>Paul <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214955910993479&amp;set=a.2268061983256&amp;type=3&amp;theater">posted a snap of the note to Facebook</a> with the caption: 'The best note on my kitchen bench since the morning after my wedding'.</p>
      <p>The image racked up 4,700 shares and even appeared to reach the very fireman who had penned it.</p>
      <p>Kale Hardie-Porter replied to say: "Hi Paul Sekfy, you have made my day!</p>
      <p>"I'm happy to know that my note got to you in one piece (knowing that the house survived once we had to leave).</p>

      <p>"Our crew of 4 did the best we could with what we had but unfortunately your two sheds didn't last a second.</p>
      <p>"We took refuge in your house for a moment and that's when we discovered the fridge."</p>
      <p>He also apologised for his 'shocking handwriting' before saying it 'was late and I couldn't see a thing'.</p>
      <p>Kale signs it off: "Again it was our pleasure to do a little good in such horrendous conditions. All the best in future."</p>
      <p>Others were quick to share in the sweet moment, with one writing: "Heartwarming news Paul in a heartbreaking story for many. Those fire fighters are legends."</p>
      <p>Another added: "If you've just saved my house, hell you can have my whole fridge and everything inside it too!"</p>
      <p>Paul declined to reveal the contents of the note he discovered the day after his wedding.</p>
