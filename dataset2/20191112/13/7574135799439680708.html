      <p><b>Thursday</b> recently announced they’d be opening the first <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/thursday-opening-my-chemical-romances-la-reunion-show/"><b>My Chemical Romance</b> reunion show</a> in LA, and they’ve now added three headlining West Coast shows around then too. And keeping with the NJ punk scene theme, they’ll be joined by <b>Saves The Day</b> frontman <b>Chris Conley</b> during their sets to play “a selection of classic songs.” Here’s Thursday frontman <b>Geoff Rickly</b>‘s full <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRickly/status/1194313890009665538">announcement</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Many of you know that we are opening for our dear friends, My Chemical Romance, for their return at the Shrine on December 20th. As that show has been sold out since it went on sale, we thought it only right to add a couple of shows for all who won’t be able to attend.<br/><br/>We are playing two special/secret warmup shows, on the 18th in San Diego and on the 19th at the legendary Roxy. On Saturday the 21st we’ll be ending the year with a special West Coast version of our Holiday Show at one of our oldest stomping grounds: the Glasshouse in Pomona.<br/><br/>In keeping with this celebration of friendship and legacy, Chris Conley of Saves the Day will be joining us, to play a selection of classic songs. <br/><br/>We can’t wait to see you there!!!</blockquote>
      <p>The shows happen in San Diego, LA, and Pomona. All dates are listed below.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Saves The Day just <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/saves-the-day-giving-through-being-cool-expanded-20th-anniversary-reissue/">reissued</a> <i>Through Being Cool</i> for its 20th anniversary and played it in full <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/saves-the-day-expand-through-being-cool-tour/">on tour</a>. We recently published a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/a-look-back-on-saves-the-days-through-being-cool-for-its-20th-anniversary/">retrospective review</a> of the album, and Chris Conley talked to us about the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/saves-the-days-chris-conley-discusses-the-music-that-influenced-through-being-cool/">music that influenced it</a>.</p>
      <p>My Chemical Romance also have <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/my-chemical-romance-add-reunion-shows-w-jimmy-eat-world-including-download-fest/">dates overseas</a> and presumably many more TBA.</p>
