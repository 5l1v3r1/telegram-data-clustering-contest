      <p>According to the Pinellas Park Police Department, officers found a dead kitten lying on the road, the <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/11/11/someone-threw-kittens-out-of-a-moving-car-in-pinellas-park-one-is-dead/">Tampa Bay Times</a> reported. It was unclear how many cats were thrown from the vehicle, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>“Our pets are just like our children for some people and they are like family members, so this is a sad kind of call for us,” Pinellas Park Police spokeswoman Sgt. Roxanne Pohl told the <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/11/11/someone-threw-kittens-out-of-a-moving-car-in-pinellas-park-one-is-dead/">Times</a>. “But we are taking the case very seriously and urge anyone who has witnessed this to contact our police department.”</p>
      <p>Police do not have a description of the car or the driver's appearance, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>If there were other cats, Pohl said she did not know what happened to them.</p>
      <p>“It’s possible these kittens could have run off and into neighboring streets,” Pohl told the <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/11/11/someone-threw-kittens-out-of-a-moving-car-in-pinellas-park-one-is-dead/">Times</a>.</p>
      <p>If a suspect is identified and caught, they could be charged with aggravated animal cruelty, the newspaper reported.</p>
