      <p>To ensure better price to the farmers of newly created union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Finance Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-nirmala-sitharaman">Nirmala Sitharaman </a>on Tuesday said the government will seek help of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nabard">NABARD </a>in procuring farm produce like saffron, peaches and walnuts from them.</p>
      <p>Also, she said, the government wants to promote solar energy generation in the union territory (UT) of Ladakh, which is also carved out of the erstwhile state of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir.</a></p>
      <p>The government has recently procured apples from the farmers of UT of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>(J&amp;K) through National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).</p>
      <p>"Now I'm ensuring that I will take the chairman of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nabard">NABARD </a>to J&amp;K even if it's winter now because I want ... the next crop of saffron, peaches and walnuts and other agri produce of J&amp;K to get that kind of support which through <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nabard">NABARD </a>the central government can extend to Jammu and Kashmir," she said at an event organised by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).</p>
      <p>NABARD Chairman Harsh Kumar Bhanwala said after the event, "Whatever responsibility is given by the government, we will do it."<br/><br/>NABARD will speak to farmers of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>and understand their issues, he said, adding that efforts will be made to provide help farmers of saffron, peaches and walnuts. Both long-term credit and short-term credit issues will also be looked at, he added. Sitharaman further said, the government was focusing on the priorities of fishermen in the coastal and inland water areas.</p>
      <p>"NABARD can focus on marketing of local nutrients in the coastal areas. It can work with the farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and self help groups (SHGs) in these areas to help increase nutritional input of the area, which could be well received in the wellness industry," she said.</p>
      <p>Pointing out that the government has taken various measures to promote financial inclusion and insuring un-insured and funding the un-funded, additional secretary in the finance ministry Debasish Panda said the effort is to ensure that the banking services are available within 5 km of every villages in the country.</p>
      <p>Financial inclusion-led intervention over a short period of time has led to transformational and directional change, he said.
