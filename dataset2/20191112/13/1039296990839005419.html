      <h1>Royal Enfield Himalayan likely to get updated in coming months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:33:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author">Firoze Irani</a></address>
      <p>The dual-tone colour schemes will most likely make their way to the Royal Enfield Himalayan in January 2020.</p>
      <p>Royal Enfield’s stand at EICMA 2019 wasn’t the most exciting one, but it did have a few interesting motorcycles on display. While the stand was mainly dominated by custom bikes built around the 650cc engine and frame, the company also had its Himalayan on display in three new colour schemes – red-and-black, blue-and-white and matte grey.</p>
      <p>What makes these colour schemes unique is that this is the first time around that the metal bracket near the tank and the grab rails are painted in colours like red and blue. These components have only been available in black until now.</p>
      <p>These colours will most likely make their way to the Himalayan in India in January 2020. What remains to be seen, however, is if these new colours will replace the existing ones – a single-tone white, a single-tone black, and a snow camouflage.</p>
      <p>There is also a high chance of Royal Enfield introducing these colour schemes on the BS6-compliant models that are also expected to debut in the coming months. Not only will this act as a mid-life refresher, but also help to better distinguish the upcoming BS6-ready models.</p>
      <p>The upcoming 2020 BS6 Royal Enfield Himalayan will most certainly come with a minor hike in its price. At present, its price begins at Rs 1.81 lakh and we can expect the entry-level updated model to be priced closer to Rs 1.90 lakh (all prices, ex-showroom, Delhi).</p>
