      <h1>MotoGP, Marquez already in 2020: "Some experiments at Valencia before the tests"</h1>
      <h2>Marc could become the first rider to achieve 400 points in a season. Lorenzo is hopeful: "I'll push myself to improve"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:12:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">GPone</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, along with brother Alex, Marc Marquez was able to celebrate his MotoGP title and now the final weekend of the season awaits him. There is not much still to play for of course, but the cannibal doesn't want to leave anything to his rivals.</p>
      <p>The team title for example, the <b>Ducati team currently leading by two points over the Honda team</b>, or rather over Marc, considering Lorenzo's limited contribution.<b> Marquez could also become the first rider in history to score 400 points in a season </b>(he is just 5 points short), <b>without forgetting the pleasure of rounding out the year with another win, which would be his twelfth of the season.</b></p>
      <p>So Marc is not without motivation, at a track where he has often reached the MotoGP podium (on 5 occasions), despite having only won the Valencia race once.<br/><br/>“<i>First I want to say thank you to everyone who came out to celebrate in Cervera, it’s always very special to do this party and to have my brother alongside me as World Champion again was really magical" </i>he comments, recalling the recent celebrations.</p>
      <p>Then he looks ahead to the upcoming weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <i><b>"Now we return to work. We have the objective of winning the Team Championship in Valencia, but also we are looking to 2020 already and continuing to try some options while we have this time before we go into test mode after the race.</b> We will try to put on one more really nice show for the fans before winter."</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Jorge Lorenzo: “I am striving to improve”</h3>
      <p>Lorenzo's previous achievements at Valencia are enviable (4 wins and 5 podiums during his career) but it will be hard to the Majorcan to improve on those stats this time. His relationship with the Honda is a difficult one and so perhaps <b>Jorge is already thinking ahead to 2020 and the new bike he'll be able to test on Tuesday, after the race.</b></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Valencia is a circuit that is quite different to the ones we have been racing at. It is very tight compared to the likes of Phillip Island and Sepang and it can <b>sometimes be quite cool, especially in the morning and this is something we must pay attention to</b>." </i>
      </p>
      <p><i><b>"After a more positive race in Malaysia, I am striving to continue making these gains and do everything I can to help the team win the title" </b></i>concludes Lorenzo.</p>
