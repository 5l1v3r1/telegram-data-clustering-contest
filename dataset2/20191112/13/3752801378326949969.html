      <p>An Eastern Cape businessman and a woman were gunned down outside his house in Port Elizabeth in the early hours of Monday, police said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Captain Andre Beetge said Luvuyo Nyongoba, 51, and friend Nonkosi Ndevu, 39, were found dead outside Nyongoba's house in Mahambehlala Street, Kwazakhele.</p>
      <p>They were found hours after a 16-year-old boy inside Nyongoba's house heard shots fired in the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>"He was too scared to go outside," said Beetge.</p>
      <p>The bodies of the two were found at about 05:30 when he eventually went out to have a look.</p>
      <p>Beetge said a rented Toyota Yaris was also found at the scene.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tensions around business dealings</b>
      </p>
      <p>He said police were investigating all possible angles and leads.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2019-11-12-black-business-caucus-director-gunned-down/">The Herald</a> reported that Nyongoba was a director of the Nelson Mandela Bay Black Business Caucus, a small business owner and a director of the Baba Ningi Black Business Caucus.</p>
      <p>It said Ndevu was listed as a director of a company called Viviyam's General Trading – registered in East London – but the company appears to have been deregistered recently.</p>
      <p>Lungelo Ningi, the former chairperson of the Baba Ningi Black Business Caucus, was killed in a shooting in January, <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/black-business-caucus-leader-killed-in-eastern-cape-20190128">News24 reported</a> at the time.</p>
      <p>Ningi, 48, was shot dead in Koyana Road, Zwide, reportedly following an argument inside a butchery between Ningi and another person in the shop.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.algoafm.co.za/article/local/98903/second-pe-man-murdered-allegedly-over-smme-dealings-in-metro-#prettyPhoto">AlgoaFM</a> reported at the time that 38-year-old Nkululeko Ngcakasi was also gunned down in Tshawula Street, New Brighton, on the same day, and police thought the shootings might have been linked.</p>
      <p>It was thought that those killings were linked to tensions around business dealings involving SMMEs in the metro, including a R21m drain cleaning tender.</p>
