      <p>Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) is considering jumping into the 2020 presidential race strongly enough that he called former Vice President Joe Biden last week to discuss his hypothetical bid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020-president.html">According to the New York Times,</a> he has also reached out to possible campaign staffers and held strategy meetings about how to mold a late-to-the-game bid.</p>
      <p>While he is not yet fully decided, he’s motivated by a fear that none of the candidates currently in the race have sufficiently energized a big enough faction to beat President Donald Trump. The same concern prompted former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to possibly enter the race last week — he filed to run in Alabama on Friday due to the state’s early deadline but has not decided for sure.</p>
      <p>Patrick faces a similar decision in New Hampshire, where he must file this week if he wants to run there.</p>
