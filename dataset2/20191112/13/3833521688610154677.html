      <h1>The Daily Chase: Pot earnings ramp up; Disney launches streaming service</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:36:58+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/talent/noah-zivitz-1.451955" target="_blank">Noah Zivitz</a></address>
      <p>Pot sector earnings season started with a thud late yesterday when Organigram posted preliminary fourth-quarter revenue that fell well short of expectations and telegraphed an adjusted loss for the period. Notably, the New Brunswick-based producer said it expects to book $3.7 million in provisions tied to product returns and “pricing adjustments.” Its stock has been down more than 20 per cent in pre-market trading. And it was a similar narrative this morning when Cronos Group also disappointed on revenue and posted a larger adjusted loss than analysts anticipated, though its shares are treading water.</p>

        <b>CHERRY OUSTED</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’re following the money on Rogers’ decision to drop Don Cherry. Most notably, how sponsor Labatt Breweries may have factored into the equation. “The comments made Saturday on Coach’s Corner were clearly inappropriate and divisive,” said a spokesperson for the brewer whose Budweiser branding is attached to the segment. “As a sponsor for the broadcast, we immediately expressed our concerns and respect [Rogers’] decision…” Paige Ellis is looking into what other Hockey Night in Canada sponsors are saying.</p>

        <b>TRUMP ADDRESSES BUSINESS ELITE</b>
      </p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump will deliver a lunch-hour speech to the Economic Club of New York today. “Nobody really knows [what to expect]. This is Donald Trump. Anything could happen,” is how Bloomberg economics expert Mike McKee teed up the speech on The Street this morning. Separately, Bloomberg News is reporting the Trump administration may delay a decision on European auto tariffs.</p>

        <b>KEY TRUDEAU MEETINGS</b>

      <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will attempt to set the tone for his minority government today with a pair of key meetings in Ottawa. First, he sits down with Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer at 9:30. Then, western alienation is on the agenda when he meets with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who’s in the nation’s capital to discuss pipelines, the carbon tax and equalization. We’ll monitor developments.</p>
