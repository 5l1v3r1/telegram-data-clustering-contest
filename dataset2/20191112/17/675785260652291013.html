      <h1>Sergio Romero let three Man Utd stars into an "Anthony Martial secret"</h1>
      <h2>The Manchester United goalkeeper played alongside Anthony Martial at Monaco before signing for the Red Devils and informing the club of the youngster's quality</h2>

      <p>Sergio Romero claims he let three Manchester United stars into the "secret" of Anthony Martial in 2015 - before the Red Devils signed him.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014 Romero was on loan at Martial's former club Monaco from Sampdoria and after signing for United a year later, spoke to David De Gea, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera.</p>
      <p>He told the Spanish trio that Monaco had a youngster in their academy named Martial and that one day "you'll all be talking about him."</p>
      <p>Martial followed Romero to United in 2015, with Louis van Gaal splashing out £36million rising to £58m for the Frenchman - the highest fee paid for a teenager at that point.</p>
      <p>Reminiscing on his first memories of Martial, Romero told Utd Unscripted: "Back in 2015, not long after I joined United, I was chatting with Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata.</p>

      <p>"I let them in on a secret. 'There's a kid at Monaco. Anthony Martial. For sure, in a short while, you'll all be talking about him'.</p>
      <p>"I'd known about Anthony for two years. In the 2013/14 season, I went to AS Monaco on loan for a year from Sampdoria in Italy.</p>
      <p>"Anthony was still very young, just a kid - I think he was 17 years old at that time - but you could already see that he was that he was a special player with lots of class and lots of talent. The kid was a natural.</p>

      <p>"You'd just be amazed at the things he would do in the training sessions."</p>
      <p>Martial is enjoying a positive run of form at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United,</a> but has fallen down the pecking order with the France national team.</p>

      <p>France boss Didier Deschamps recently spoke out about future opportunities to play the forward. He said: "He was part of the French team on a regular basis, but recently he was often injured.</p>
      <p>"He came back not so long ago and it's going well in his role as a central striker with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>. For a long time he's been part of the players likely to be called up."</p>
