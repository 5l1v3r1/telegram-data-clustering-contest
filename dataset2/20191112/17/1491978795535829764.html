      <p>Great Britain’s Sophie Hahn claimed a fourth straight World Para-Athletics title and lowered her own world record to take T38 100m gold in Dubai.</p>
      <p>The Commonwealth Games, European and 2016 Paralympics champion again proved too strong for the field as she raced clear to win in 12.38 seconds. Hungary’s Luca Ekler secured the silver medal, finishing in 12.89secs, with Australian Rhiannon Clarke (12.94s) taking bronze ahead of Britain’s Olivia Breen, while Ali Smith was sixth.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Tuesday, Rich Chiassaro won bronze for Great Britain in the T54 400m, as did 2018 European champion Vanessa Wallace in the F34 shot put, her first World Championship medal. Ireland’s Niamh McCarthy took bronze in the women’s F41 discus.</p>
      <p>Brazil, meanwhile, delivered a clean sweep in the men’s 100m T47 final, as Petrucio Ferreira Dos Santos took gold ahead of Washington Junior and Yohansson Nascimento.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Britain’s Hollie Arnold and Jonathan Broom-Edwards both won gold. Arnold set a new championship record of 44.73m to defend her women’s javelin F46 title, while Broom-Edwards cleared 2.02m at his third attempt to win the T64 high jump.</p>
      <p>Arnold broke her own championship record to take the lead halfway through her event and that was enough to seal victory ahead of New Zealand’s Holly Robinson and the Venezuelan bronze medallist Naibys Morillo.</p>

      <p>Broom-Edwards and closest rival Temurbek Giyazov, from Uzbekistan, both failed to clear 2.02m at their first two attempts, but the Briton, who ruptured his achilles last season, cleared it with his final attempt to take gold.</p>
      <p>The British sprinters Kadeena Cox and Thomas Young both took silver after being edged out in photo finishes in their respective events. Cox lost out to Russia’s Margarita Goncharova in the women’s 400m T38 and Young was beaten by a thousandth of a second by China’s Zhu Dening in the men’s 100m T38.</p>
