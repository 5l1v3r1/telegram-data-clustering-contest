        <i>Boarding schools | Wellington college fees | Steve McQueen’s Year 3 project | Spike Milligan’s election advice | Shared ancestry | Parliamentary disillusion</i>

      <p>George Monbiot’s article on boarding schools (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/07/boarding-schools-boris-johnson-bullies">Journal</a>, 7 November) will have been a painful read for many, and may well have been painful for him to write. As a director for <a href="https://www.bss-support.org.uk/">Boarding School Survivors Support</a> (BSSS), I read of experience after experience of suffering. I applaud Mr Monbiot for having the courage to bring his story into the public eye. For those who suffer, there is help: visit the <a href="https://www.bss-support.org.uk/">BSSS website</a> as a first step.<br/><b>Margaret Laughton </b><br/><i>London</i></p>
      <p>• Mike Hoskin (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/10/big-flute-discovery-and-billionaire-woes">Letters</a>, 11 November) says the current fees for Wellington college (my alma mater) are about £30,000. In fact it charges about £42,000 a year for boarders. His point nonetheless remains entirely valid.<br/><b>Chris Entwistle</b><br/><i>Tiptree, Essex</i></p>
      <p>• Last year two of our grandchildren were in year 3. They live in Cumbria and Dorset, so they didn’t qualify for a photo by Steve McQueen (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/11/steve-mcqueen-hopes-year-3-inspire-arts-next-generation">Report</a>, 12 November). How good it would have been for him to step out of the capital and record some of the other millions of British children.<br/><b>Janet Mansfield </b><br/><i>Aspatria, Cumbria</i></p>
      <p>• Adrian Chiles’ discovery of so much voter apathy (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/06/unconditional-love-for-pet-not-political-party-adrian-chiles">G2, 7 November</a>) is best countered by reference to Spike Milligan, who <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2019-10-14a.70.0">once said</a>: “One day the don’t-knows will get in, and then where will we be?”<br/><b>Roy Hollingworth</b><br/><i>Boston Spa, West Yorkshire</i></p>
      <p>• Thank you to Adam Rutherford (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/12/ant-and-dec-dna-test-all-inbred-historical-connections">Journal</a>, 12 November) for solving our Brexit identity mess: “All people of long-standing European descent have the same ancestors a thousand years ago.” QED. <br/><b>Rev</b><b> Dr Alan Race </b><br/><i>Market Harborough, Leicestershire</i></p>
      <p>• I’m sure that I heard the BBC newsreader Huw Edwards refer to the disillusion of parliament last week. Seems appropriate.<br/><b>Neil Thomas</b><br/><i>Colchester</i></p>
