      <h1>Confirmed: Manchester United dealt injury blow ahead of Aston Villa clash</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side welcome the Villa Park outfit at the beginning of December in the Premier League after a clash with Newcastle United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:41:24+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has pulled out of the Scotland squad for European Championships qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>McTominay had to be carried off the Old Trafford pitch in Sunday's 3-1 defeat of Brighton and Hove Albion with an ankle injury, the international team-mate of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> star John McGinn withdrawing from his national team's camp as a result.</p>
      <p>The Scots will play Cyprus in Nicosia on Saturday night before hosting Kazakhstan at Hampden Park the following Tuesday, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">McGinn</a> called up for those matches.</p>
      <p>But McTominay's withdrawal hands Villa a major boost ahead of the Premier League meeting between the pair in Manchester at the beginning of December.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has started every Premier League game this season.</p>

      <p>Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney, AFC Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser and Liverpool full-back Andy Robertson joined McTominay in leaving the Scotland squad.</p>
      <p>Scotland assistant head coach Alex Dyer refuted suggestions players had decided to leave the Scotland squad for any other reason.</p>
