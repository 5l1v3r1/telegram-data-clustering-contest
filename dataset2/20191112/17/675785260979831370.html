      <h1>I'm A Celebrity: How Katie Price seduced Peter Andre with lewd act at jungle reunion</h1>
      <h2>Peter Andre wasn't sure if he saw a future with Katie Price when they reunited after I'm A Celebrity... but he didn't take much convincing</h2>

      <p>When Katie Price and Peter Andre's paths crossed in the Australian jungle in 2004, it was lust at first sight.</p>
      <p>The unlikely duo couldn't keep their hands off each other, driving their fellow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here</a> campmates to distraction with their constant flirting and hammock massages.</p>
      <p>Katie - who was dating Scott Sullivan when she entered the show - ended up getting evicted as punishment for giving Pete the runaround.</p>
      <p>But she was waiting for him on the outside and ready to take their romance to the next level... in more ways than one.</p>

      <p>However, there was one hurdle standing in the way - and that was Peter's second thoughts.</p>
      <p>"When I saw her for the first time with her hair done nicely and with full make-up on, do you know what I thought? Inside I went, ugh!" he wrote in his 2010 autobiography, All About Us - My Story.</p>
      <p>"She was also a bit drunk and I didn't like that.</p>
      <p>"She could tell I was staring at her face, which was so different from the one I'd become accustomed to in the jungle. All I could think to say that wouldn't be too unkind was, 'I think you looked better... in the jungle without the make-up and the hair off your face."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>His concerned parents had already warned him to 'stay away' from the glamour model, but despite Katie's appearance, Pete was hooked.</p>
      <p>Not wanting to waste any time, he says Katie virtually proposed right there and then, whispering, "There's one thing I have to say. It begins with M and it's a leap year."</p>
      <p>Before he could answer, he was whisked off into isolation to protect those precious exclusive deals, but Katie managed to get a present to him - a recording of Phil Collins' Against All Odds.</p>
      <p>That, Peter said, was the first time he realised they were meant to be.</p>

      <p>"That was the moment I knew Katie and I were going to spend the rest of our lives together. Our love really was against all odds," he wrote.</p>
      <p>A determined Katie then managed to weasel her way past Pete's security and infiltrate his lockdown by 'storming' into his room.</p>
      <p>"She was wearing a horrible low cut top and a very short skirt. Her hair was all frizzy and looked a mess," Pete sniped, claiming she barged into the bathroom and again asked him to marry her.</p>
      <p>"She was drunk and I couldn't take her seriously. Judging by the state of her, I doubted a relationship would last more than a week!" he said.</p>
      <p>Then she started to cry before offering him a taste of the good stuff - a move Peter couldn't resist.</p>

      <p>"No, you can't let me go. I've never felt his way about anyone," Pete said she wailed.</p>
      <p>"Never, never, never. Look, I'll prove it to you... I'll never leave your side... every day... every night... do you want a little suck?"</p>
      <p>Despite being in turmoil over whether to 'respect her or not', Pete admitted the lust too strong to resist and the "acorn was once again an oak".</p>
      <p>From that moment on he was preoccupied by "what it would be like to be inside her," and Katie and Peter became a thing.</p>
