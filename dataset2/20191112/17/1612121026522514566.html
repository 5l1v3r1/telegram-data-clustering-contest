      <p>Disney+ launched today, and it’s probably the most hyped up video service launch that we’ve ever seen. It’s a good deal, too, offering so much content for a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339113-disneys-netflix-killer-is-coming-later-this-year-and-its-cheap/">relatively small monthly fee</a>.</p>
      <p>But apparently Disney wasn’t prepared for how many people would want to stream on day one, and it’s been riddled with issues all day.</p>
      <h3>Even Disney has launch issues</h3>
      <p>After launching early in the morning to users on the east coast, a cute error message with Wreck-It Ralph popped up stating that <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/334566-disneys-streaming-service-is-called-disney-and-set-to-launch-late-2019/">Disney+ was unable to connect</a>. It’s not happening with everyone, but users across social media have reported the problem with a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343332-disney-plus-devices-supported/">variety of devices</a>, including Roku sticks, mobile phones, Apple TVs, Xboxes, and everything else that it’s available on. Not a great look for something launched by the biggest media company on the planet.</p>
      <p>Disney said they were ready for this launch, and they tested things out in The Netherlands ahead of its full release, but clearly things weren’t really prepared for this much traffic. They did say that they’re monitoring Disney+ 24/7 to try and mitigate any issues, so hopefully the errors are short-lived, but this might interrupt your <i><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346065-disney-plus-ads-for-starz/">Star Wars</a></i><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346065-disney-plus-ads-for-starz/"> binge</a> during launch week.</p>
