      <h1>Samsung Galaxy A51 leaked with four rear cameras, sticks with headphone jack and microSD slot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:03:04+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/jules-wang/" target="_blank">Jules Wang</a></address>
      <p>It might not be <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/24/samsung-announces-flagship-exynos-990-soc-5g-exynos-modem-5123-and-new-12gb-ram-chip/">the phone we're going to talk the most about</a>, but we think it's still pretty important to have a look at and learn about one of Samsung's upcoming smartphones coming out next year. Now, courtesy of some leaks, we're getting a preview of what will be the Galaxy A51.</p>
      <p>The A51 is supposedly a follow-on to this year's <a href="https://www.samsung.com/in/microsite/galaxya/a50s/">A50s</a> and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/02/28/samsung-announces-galaxy-a50-and-a30-midrangers-with-glass-tic-bodies-and-teardrop-notches/#Galaxy_A50">A50</a>. Most of the Galaxy A portfolio targets the South Asia and Indian markets which pack on raw horsepower for a value price. In the case of the A51 — the speculative details and renders of which come from leaks blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1194147185555845120">Steve Hemmerstoffer</a> via Indian blog <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-images-punch-hole-display-quad-cameras-exclusive">Pricebaba Daily</a> — we're looking at a couple of spec bumps.</p>

      <p>In addition to the three vertically-aligned cameras on the back, there's now a fourth one offset to the right of the bottom lens — we have no explicit context on what each does, but going by context clues, we may see a dedicated telephoto unit come alongside the standard, ultra-wide, and depth cameras.</p>
      <p>The AMOLED display gets stretched out the tiniest bit from 6.4" to 6.5". While surface area shrinks by a tad, the A51 does become slightly thicker than the A50 by 0.2mm at 7.9mm. The camera bump pushes things up to 8.5mm. We may expect an in-display fingerprint sensor as seen on the A50s.</p>

      <p>However, many of the A51's other specs are tipped to be carried over from the older A50s, according to DroidShout: the Exynos 9611 SoC, 4GB of RAM (as one option, we believe), the 48MP main rear camera, the 32MP selfie sensor, USB-C, a microSD card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack — the latter two remain a sight for sore eyes heading into 2020. The best thing to hope for, though, is that the phone will run with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/10/samsung-one-ui-2-0-beta-with-android-10-hits-a-snag-delayed-til-mid-october/">Android 10 and One UI 2.0</a> right out of the box.</p>
      <p>The phone is said to be in production at Samsung's plants in Greater Noida, India, and will debut in the first quarter. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/07/galaxy-a50-us-price-release-date/">If history repeats itself</a>, some U.S. carriers and unlocked phone sellers will sell this phone next summer.</p>
