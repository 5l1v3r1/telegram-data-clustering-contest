      <h2>As I'm A Celebrity returns, presenter Dec Donnelly is holding on to his youth with a fresh dye job covering his grey hair</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:48:36+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p>I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! presenter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> has unveiled his brand new look ahead of the show's return next Sunday.</p>
      <p>The star, who will host the ITV show alongside <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ant-mcpartlin">Ant McPartlin</a> , is sporting a fresh dye job in the new promo shots for the series.</p>
      <p>Last year, the 44-year-old let his natural greys show, but this year he has opted to cover them with dark brown dye, making him look even more youthful.</p>
      <p>This year will see Dec's presenting partner Ant return to the show after he missed last year's series due to troubles with alcohol and prescription pills.</p>

      <p>Ant's issues led him to check into rehab in 2017, and then in March 2018 he was fined Â£86,000 and banned from driving after a drink drive crash,.</p>
      <p>In his absence, This Morning host Holly Willoughby stepped in to join Dec on the show.</p>
      <p>But now the Geordie duo are reunited after recently starring in their documentary Ant &amp; Dec's DNA Journey.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> hosts have been best pals for years, and on the doc they discovered they were DNA cousins.</p>

      <p>They were told the exciting news by the show's scientist, after fans speculated the stars were related somewhere down the line.</p>
      <p>Ant read out a message on his phone saying: "Ant you have a DNA cousin match," as Dec also read out the same message on his phone.</p>
      <p>Each of them split off into different locations ahead of the announcement - where Dec was greeted by his American cousins Megan and Greg.</p>
      <p>Dec was handed an envelope which revealed the pair are in fact DNA cousins, leaving them both completely shocked at the news.</p>

      <p>In an emotional speech shown on the documentary, the long time pals discussed Ant's substance abuse and how it tested their friendship.</p>
      <p>Ant said: "The last few years have been quite emotional, hard... they've been testing I would say how strong your love is, friendship is..."</p>
      <p>And Dec added: "It's been a tough couple of years it's really tested the bond we've shared since we were 13 years old.</p>

      <p>"I was incredibly angry at the start, so angry and disappointed in him that he didn't ever come to me and say 'I'm struggling, I need you', because I thought if the shoe was on the other foot I would have gone to him said 'I'm in trouble', and he never came to me and that hurt me a lot."</p>
      <p>Ant gushed over Dec for being "fantastic" and a "very kind man" while he supported him through his trying times.</p>
      <p>He added: "Dec's been fantastic, he's a very kind man who's been supportive of me, and our friendship has been tested and it's come out through the other end and I'll be forever grateful for the love we have.</p>
