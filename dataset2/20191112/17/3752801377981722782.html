      <p>A Durban family is struggling to come to terms with the death of their parents following heavy storms in and around the city on Monday.</p>
      <p>Amaoti couple Nomathamsanqa Nyangule, 55, and Simangaliso Zondo, 69, died after the roof and wall of their house collapsed on them at around 21:00 on Monday.</p>
      <p>Also on Monday in rural KwaZulu-Natal, an Okhahlamba woman, 24-year-old Sthembile Zimba, was killed following a lightning strike, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to journalists outside their devastated home, the couple's daughter, Zilungile Nyangule, 19, said she was at a loss for words after her parents' death.</p>
      <p>"We were so close. They meant the world to me. We loved each other. I don't know what to say because we were so close."</p>
      <p>Nyangule said they were asleep when the family woke to a loud bang.</p>
      <p>"It was around 21:00, my sister and I were sleeping. I heard a noise and woke up and came to the sitting room and saw the walls on top of my parents. We called the community to help, which they did, but [my parents] were dead."</p>

      <p>Durban Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda sent his condolences to the family.</p>
      <p>"We have visited the family and passed on our heartfelt condolences. We pledge our support for them during this difficult period," Kaunda said.</p>
      <p>He cautioned motorists to drive slowly when it rains and urged residents not to throw garbage in drainage systems.</p>
      <p>"We have put together a team from all units led by disaster management so we can deal with the damage. In some areas bridges have collapsed, and roads developed sinkholes."</p>
      <p>

      <p>Hlomuka called on residents residing in low-lying areas to seek shelter on higher ground.  </p>
      <p>"We are urging residents to be extremely cautious as severe thunderstorms [are expected]."</p>
      <p>He said the northern areas of the province - which include uThukela, Mzinyathi, Amajuba and Zululand district municipalities - could be affected.</p>
      <p>"Our teams are on the ground and we are urging residents to be cautious and to double-check the weather forecast before making any long journeys. We appeal to parents and teachers to ensure that scholars utilise proper routes going to and coming back from schools."</p>
