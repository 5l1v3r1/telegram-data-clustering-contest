      <h1>Watch British Trio Our Girl Perform Songs from Their Debut LP in the Paste Studio</h1>

      <p>British trio Our Girl stopped by <i>Paste</i>’s Atlanta Studio to perform songs from their debut album <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/08/our-girl-stranger-today-review.html"><i>Stranger Today</i></a>, out now via Cannibal Hymns. <i>Paste</i> included <i>Stranger Today</i> in our list of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/12/10-great-albums-you-mightve-missed-in-2018.html">10 Great Albums You Might’ve Missed in 2018</a>, and we also premiered their “Being Around” <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/10/exclusive-brighton-rock-trio-our-girl-share-englis.html">music video</a>.</p>
      <p>Our Girl are currently touring the U.S. with The Japanese House, and they popped into our Atlanta HQ to perform three songs: “I Really Like It,” “In My Head” and “Two Life.” Lead vocalist and songwriter Soph Nathan also discussed the origins of the band and filming their video for “I Really Like It” in her living room. Completed by drummer Lauren Wilson and bassist Josh Tyler, Our Girl’s tender lyrics and steamy guitar squalls are an incredibly effective paradox.</p>
