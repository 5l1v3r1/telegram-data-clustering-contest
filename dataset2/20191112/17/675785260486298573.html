      <h1>Tahith Chong 'decides against signing new Man Utd contract' amid Juventus interest</h1>
      <h2>The young Dutch winger has made four appearances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side so far this season but is thought to be tempted by a move to Italy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:28:32+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Tahith Chong could follow in the footsteps of Paul Pogba by leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> on a free and joining Serie A side <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Chong made his first senior appearance for the Red Devils last season and has since featured eight times in all competitions as manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer tries to gradually bed him into the first-team.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old is out of contract in June and has been offered a new deal by the club, but according to Italian outlet <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/juventus-si-studia-il-colpo-a-parametro-zero-in-casa-manchester--15199">Calciomercato</a> Chong is tempted to seek another challenge away from Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>If he did go to Juventus it would be a carbon copy of Pogba's move from United in 2016, with the Frenchman eventually re-signing for United for a then-world record fee of Â£89m.</p>

      <p>Chong's agent Erkan Alkan recently admitted elite clubs were monitoring his client's situation, and said the player would not be willing to leave United on loan.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.vi.nl/cookies/;jsessionid=4A0322B880BA14387E1ABD8161160EC9">Voetbal International</a> he said: "Tahith does not want to be loaned, but he wants to fight for his chance at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>"Top clubs from the Bundesliga and La Liga also have him in sight. He has done a strong preparation in which he has proven to be one of the better attackers of United."</p>
      <p>Chong himself, meanwhile, said: "For me, all options are currently open. I have to focus on the season first, then I'll see where my journey takes me."</p>

      <p>The loss of Chong would come as a big blow for United supporters, who see him as one of their brightest young players.</p>
      <p>He won the club's Young Player of the Year Award in 2017-2018 and also featured during United's historic 3-1 win over PSG in the Champions League last-16 second leg last season.</p>
