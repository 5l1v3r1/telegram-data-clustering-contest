      <p>The German giants are currently without a full-time manager after Niko Kovac departed the Allianz Arena nine days ago. Hans-Joachim Flick has since taken over in the interim and guided the Bavarians to two comfortable wins, over Olympiacos and Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Flick, a former assistant coach to Germany boss Joachim Low, will likely lead Bayern until the end of the season, when the club's bosses will present a new coach, unless the incumbent can convince all doubters otherwise with silverware.</p>

      <p>According to <i>The Athletic</i>, though, the Bundesliga champions' dream candidate to lead the club into a new era of success, in particular in the UEFA Champions League, would be Tottenham Hotspur coach Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Bayern "would do anything to get him" if he and Spurs were to go their separate ways, but Manchester United and Real Madrid could also be after his services.</p>
      <p>However, the same report also suggested that there is a chance that Bayern will lure Guardiola back to Germany.</p>
      <p>It is the feeling in some circles that this season is his last with City, and he still has a strong relationship with Bavarian club's leadership and also retains a property in Munich.</p>

      <p>Guardiola, though, did say in June that he would not return to Bayern or FC Barcelona.</p>
