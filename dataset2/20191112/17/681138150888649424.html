      <p>A resident living in Barrett's Lane has described being woken at around 12.45am on Sunday by a loud bang as the car came to rest in his front garden.</p>
      <p>The man, who asked to remain anonymous, got out of bed and peered out of his window to discover his garden wall had been "destroyed"'</p>
      <p>After running outside, he found a man laying on the ground and the car resting in his garden.</p>
      <p>The eyewitness said: "It was quite a way to wake up to be honest.</p>
      <p>"I heard a noise and looked through my window outside. There was a Range Rover smashed through the wall at the front of my house and stopped on the grass. I ran outside and there was a group of men on the pavement and one on the floor.</p>
      <p>"The wall is completely destroyed. You can see that is was smashed to bits."</p>
      <p>A man then got in the Range Rover and drove away from the scene.</p>
      <p>"The Range Rover just reversed off the grass through the wall and drove off," said the resident.</p>
      <p>Suffolk police later arrested a man in connection with the incident.</p>
      <p>A police spokeswoman said: "We were called to a road traffic collision at 12.45am on Sunday, November 10 between a car and a pedestrian.</p>
      <p>"We arrested a man on suspicion of failing to stop following a road collision and driving with excess alcohol.</p>
      <p>"He was later released under investigation while enquires continue."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from the ambulance service, said: "An ambulance was called to Barrett's Lane, Needham Market, shortly before 1am on Sunday morning, following reports that a pedestrian had been injured in a road traffic collision. A man was transported to Ipswich Hospital for further assessment and care."</p>
