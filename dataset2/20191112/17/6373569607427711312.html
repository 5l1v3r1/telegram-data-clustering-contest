      <p>A range of designs that have been worn by the likes of Sienna Miller and Kate Moss are being sold in Plymouth this week for cheap.</p>
      <p>Emma Hanbury started Marosa Ltd in 2000 when she began selling her own designed clothes and accessories.</p>
      <p>For many years she had a shop on the Kings Road in London as well as a successful online business.</p>
      <p>Now, Emma is closing Marosa to pursue other ventures and all remaining stock will be available to buy at Wembury House this week.</p>
      <p>"I've been living in Plymouth for around 30 years," Emma told Plymouth Live.</p>

      <p>"I started Marosa around 20 years ago when my children were reasonably grown up.</p>
      <p>"I've always had a love of India and embroidery as well as the colours they used, so this theme has been the basis for my designs.</p>
      <p>"Marosa started organically and slowly, and peaked around ten years ago when I had a shop in London.</p>
      <p>"But, I decided I needed to live more full time in Devon, so that coupled with London's high rent and the fact I would have to employ someone to work in the shop, meant that I worked mainly as an online business.</p>

      <p>"Now, my attentions have moved to interior design, and I feel like this is the right time to close Marosa.</p>
      <p>"This week, everything must go, and it would be amazing if it did."</p>
      <p>Coats, jackets, skirts, shawls, stoles, boots, jewelery and more will be on sale this week.</p>
      <p>Dates and times are Thursday, November 14, 6pm- 9pm, Friday, November 15, 10am - 5pm and Saturday, November 16, 10am - 1pm.</p>
