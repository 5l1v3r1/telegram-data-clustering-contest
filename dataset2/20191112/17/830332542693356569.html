      <p>(CNN) - Former 2016 US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has spoken out in support of the Duchess of Sussex over the way the royal has been treated in the UK.</p>
      <p>Race and gender are "absolutely" a factor, Clinton said during an interview with the BBC on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Meghan Markle recently said she struggled to deal with the repercussions of being a new mother in the spotlight and together with her husband is suing a British newspaper for releasing an edited version of a private letter she sent to her father.</p>
      <p>Clinton said "race was clearly an element" in some of the comments Meghan has received on social media.</p>
      <p>"To think that some of your -- what we would call mainstream -- media actually allowed that to be printed in their pages, or amplified, was heartbreaking and wrong," Clinton said in a joint interview on BBC Radio 5 Live alongside her daughter Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"I feel as a mother I just want to put my arms around her.</p>
      <p>"Oh my God, I want to hug her. I want to tell her to hang in there, don't let those bad guys get you down, keep going, do what you think is right."</p>
      <p>The former first lady was full of praise for the Duchess, who she called "an amazing young woman."</p>
      <p>"She has stood up for herself, she has made her own way in the world," said Clinton.</p>
      <p>"And then she falls in love, and he falls in love with her, and everybody should be celebrating that because it is a true love story."</p>
      <p>Clinton said that Meghan could benefit from learning some "techniques" like "some humor, some deflection," but added: "It is tough what she is going through and I think she deserves a lot better."</p>
      <p>Meghan gave a rare glimpse into her personal life in an interview with ITV in October, talking about the issues she's grappled with as a new wife, mother, and duchess whose life has been judged and dissected by the media and public since she first began dating Prince Harry.</p>
      <p>"Not many people have asked if I'm OK, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes," she said.</p>
      <p>Clinton is in the UK as part of a book tour with her daughter.</p>
