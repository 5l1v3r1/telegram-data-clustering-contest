      <p>As both <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/greta-gerwig-director-lady-bird.html">Greta Gerwig</a> and new show <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/dickinson-tv-show-literary-weirdos.html"><i>Dickinson</i></a><i> </i><a href="https://twitter.com/kvanaren/status/1192183042435158017">will tell you</a>, Louisa May Alcott was <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/emily-dickinson-tv-show-historical-accuracy.html">all about that hustle</a>, and the writer and director of the new <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/little-women-trailer-with-timothe-chalamet-saoirse-ronan.html"><i>Little Women</i></a><i> </i>film has been very clear that her update of the classic story by Alcott is in no small part about women and money. In the time of the beloved March family, it was hard for women to earn their own money, and almost impossible for them to keep it if they were contractually bound to a man. In this new clip from Gerwig’s film, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/midsommars-florence-pugh-interview-little-women-group-text.html">Florence Pugh’s</a> Amy March makes that exact dilemma clear to Laurie (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/timothee-chalamet-hollywoods-new-king.html">Timothée Chalamet</a>), who has the luxury of being an impractical hopeless romantic while she does not. <i>Little Women </i>arrives in theaters on Christmas Day.</p>
