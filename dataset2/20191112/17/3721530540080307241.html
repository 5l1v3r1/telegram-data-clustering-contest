      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/26/18518584/13-reasons-why-katherine-langford-avengers-endgame-role-casting-rumors">Katherine Langford </a>finally makes her <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> appearance — in a deleted scene available on Disney Plus.</p>
      <p>The <i>13 Reasons Why</i> star was cast in an unspecified Marvel Cinematic Universe role back in Oct. 2018, but when the movie was first released, she was nowhere to be found. Ardent <i>13 Reasons Why</i> fans theorized she might’ve been in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo. Alternatively she may have been playing Hawkeye’s protege Kate Bishop, or that she may never have been cast in the first place.</p>
      <p>Turns out, Langford did have a role and a filmed scene ... it just didn’t make the final film. The scene, now viewable on Disney Plus, has her playing a grown-up version of Tony Stark’s daughter Morgan, in a vision that Tony sees after snapping the Infinity Stones. It was intended to serve as a goodbye scene for Iron Man, but was eventually removed because it didn’t really add much.</p>
      <p>“We felt it ground the movie to a halt and we felt he did something similar in the next sequence when he gives his own eulogy,” explains Joe Russo in the commentary. “What can happen in a film this big is you can have ending after ending after ending and it starts to feel like the movie’s never going to end. When you have too many [ending] sequences in a row, you can dilute the value of each one of them.”</p>
      <p>Now that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/12/20955914/disney-plus-down-slow-launch-day-the-mandalorian-error-76">Disney Plus is running more-or-less smoothly</a>, the full scene is available on the service, under the extras tab for <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>
