      <p>Nigerian Afrobeats musician, Burna Boy, has pledged part of his earnings from a concert to be held in Capetown, South Africa to the victims of xenophobic attacks that rocked the country a few months ago.</p>
      <p>Burna Boy, who was one of the attacks’ fiercest critics on social media, <a href="https://twitter.com/burnaboy/status/1168952955296473089?lang=en">initially promised</a> he would “NOT EVER go to South Africa again for any reason until the SOUTH AFRICAN government wakes the f**k up”.</p>
      <p>He even got into an exchange of words with South African rapper, AKA, whose sentiments on the xenophobic attacks seems to have rubbed off the wrong way on Burna Boy.</p>
      <p>But the Nigerian superstar seems to have had a change of heart and is billed as one of the big names to headline the November 23 concert.</p>
      <p>The concert has been dubbed Africa Unite and will feature other musicians such as Nigerian-American Jidenna as well as South Africans Kwesta and Busiswa.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Burna Boy confirmed rumours which had circulated for weeks that he was going to be in South Africa after all.</p>

      <p>He tweeted: “The first of many! Part of the proceeds will be donated to the victims of Xenophobic attacks by me! I really hope we can all keep contributing in our own way to make the world a better and safer place for each other. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Africansunite?src=hashtag_click">#Africansunite</a> , it’s bigger than all of us.”</p>
      <p>The artiste has enjoyed a successful 2019 which saw him releasing his fourth studio album titled <i>African Giant.</i> Burna Boy was also awarded 2019’s BET Best International Act.</p>
