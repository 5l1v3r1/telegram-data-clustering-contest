      <p>"We have shared the most amazing times and life together, and we are truly grateful for knowing love at its full capacity.</p>
      <p>"We will continue on our paths as the ultimate friends, and dog mums, united by the bond and memories we will always share.</p>

      <p>The sad news comes six months after the couple had announced that they were having <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/x-factors-lucy-spraggan-has-fostered-12-children-while-having-fertility-treatment/">fertility treatment in order to try for a baby</a>.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the singer had said they were getting plenty of practice at being parents as they had opened up their home to children in need.</p>

      <p>The couple had become foster parents, taking in 12 children so far - ranging in ages from newborns to teenagers.</p>
      <p>Lucy told The Mirror that she and Georgina decided to act after seeing the plight of homeless Syrian refugee children on the news.</p>
      <p>"The next day we headed to our local fostering centre in Stockport to see if we could help," she said.</p>

      <p>Lucy told stand-in host Christine Lampard that she had made changes in her lifestyle to achieve the weight loss.</p>
      <p>"The beer, biscuits and bread, I did that quite a while ago and I'm quite good at doing things to an excess," she admitted."I'm not drinking at all at the moment, so that makes a big difference," she continued.</p>
      <p>"With regards to weight loss, beer, bread and biscuits... for me I had to knock them on the head."</p>
