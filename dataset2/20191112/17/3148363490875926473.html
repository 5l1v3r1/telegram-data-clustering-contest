      <p>“I am suspending my race for the Presidency because impeachment has made my goal of making the debt, deficit and spending issue a part of this presidential debate impossible right now,” Sanford announced his of his intention to exit the race after a brief press conference in New Hampshire, an early primary state.</p>
      <p>“From day one, I was fully aware of how hard it would be to elevate these issues with a sitting president of my own party ignoring them,” he added. “Impeachment noise has moved what was hard to herculean as nearly everything in Republican party politics is currently viewed through the prism of impeachment.”</p>
      <p>Sanford entered the race in September, claiming that the GOP had “lost” its compass under President Trump and pledging to make national deficit solutions his primary campaign focus.</p>
      <p>His departure still leaves former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld as Republican primary candidates.</p>
