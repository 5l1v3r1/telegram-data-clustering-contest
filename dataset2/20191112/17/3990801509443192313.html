      <h1>Russian blockchain token named in false Tunisian digital currency report pumps, then dumps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:21:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>Despite government-issued digital currencies being all the rage these days, the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) has quickly refuted claims that it had launched its own version with the help of a foreign company.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.bct.gov.tn/bct/siteprod/actualites.jsp?id=638">statement published</a> on Monday said the BCT denied “all these allegations and unfounded information.”</p>
      <p>The statement clarifies that the BCT is currently exploring all existing payment alternatives, but insists this is “still in the phase of reflection.”</p>
      <p>However, the BCT did admit that it is considering a central bank digital currency (CBDC), as it claims to be exploring “all existing alternatives,” but it does not have immediate plans for the “E-dinar” to go live.</p>
      <p>“The bank is studying the opportunities and risks inherent in these new technologies, particularly in terms of cybersecurity and financial stability,” the statement reads.</p>
      <p>Finally, the statement confirms that the “BCT has not engaged, in any relationship, of any kind, with a national or foreign provider with the aim of creating any digital currency.”</p>
      <h3>Throughout all of this, Universa Blockchain token attracts serious attention</h3>
      <p>Rumors about Tunisia’s state-issued digital currency <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/11/moonday-mornings-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-condo-new-york/">surfaced recently</a>, after Russian news agency <a href="https://tass.ru/nacionalnye-proekty/7090822">TASS reported</a> that it had launched a test version of its “E-dinar,” issued by Universa Blockchain, a platform created by Russian developers.</p>

      <p>The price of Universa Blockchain’s token, Universa, underwent a pump that lasted several days during the surfacing of these reports. In the wake of this debunking, it’s price dumped.</p>
      <p>It’s currently trading at $0.002976 per token, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/universa">down over 50-percent</a> in the past day.</p>
      <p>One possible explanation for the increased volume (and price) is that keen-eyed speculators saw the erroneous reports and immediately looked to capitalize on the news. After all, “buy the rumor, sell the news,” is a popular adage for cryptocurrency traders.</p>
      <p>The bank’s denial comes after the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/12/former-federal-reserve-chair-says-bank-issued-digital-currencies-are-pointless/">rendered central bank digital currencies pointless.</a></p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/14/ing-says-bank-owned-digital-currencies-are-coming-and-were-all-doomed/">Dutch bank ING</a> and <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/30/ibm-joins-ing-in-saying-central-bank-digital-currencies-are-on-the-way/">IBM recently speculated</a> that central bank digital currencies were on their way, and would become a part of our financial future — likely given that <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/28/chinas-tech-race-with-the-us-heats-up-as-it-readies-to-launch-its-digital-currency/">China is reportedly readying</a> to launch its own state-run digital currency.</p>
