      <h1>UK Labour Party hit by second cyber attack in 24 hours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:35:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Labour has suffered a second cyber attack on its digital platforms within the space of 24 hours, the party said.</p>
      <p>A party spokeswoman said the latest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incident was being dealt with “quickly and efficiently”.</p>
      <p>Earlier, leader Jeremy Corbyn expressed concern after the party experienced what it described as a “sophisticated and large scale” DDoS attack on Monday.</p>
      <p>However, PA understands it was a relatively “low level” attack.</p>
      <p>The National Cyber Security Centre confirmed it would not be investigating the matter further, while a source said there was no evidence of “state-sponsored activity”.</p>
      <p>DDoS attacks – where hackers flood a target’s online platforms with traffic from various sources, causing them to slow or crash – are considered relatively common.</p>
      <p>Following the latest incident, a Labour spokeswoman said: “We have ongoing security processes in place to protect our platforms, so users may be experiencing some differences.</p>
      <p>“We are dealing with this quickly and efficiently.”</p>
      <blockquote>If this is a sign of things to come in this election, I feel very nervous about it all</blockquote>
      <p>Speaking at a campaign event in Blackpool following the first incident, Mr Corbyn said he was “nervous” about what it could mean for the rest of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>“We have a system in place in our office to protect us against these cyber attacks, but it was a very serious attack against us,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So far as we’re aware, none of our information was downloaded and the attack was actually repulsed because we have an effective in-house developed system by people within our party.</p>
      <p>“But if this is a sign of things to come in this election, I feel very nervous about it all because a cyber attack against a political party in an election is suspicious, something one is very worried about.”</p>
