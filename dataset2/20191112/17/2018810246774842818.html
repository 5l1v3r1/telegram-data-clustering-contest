      <p>It's a busy week for new games: hello <i>Jedi Fallen Order</i>, <i>Sword &amp; No Psyduck Shield</i>. But the week's about to get even more frantic, because it's sale season.</p>
      <p>We already had a string of deals earlier in the week to coincide with Singles Day, the biggest online and retail shopping day of the year. But Australians have some extra bargain days of their own, starting with Click Frenzy.</p>
      <p>The day doesn't traditionally have as much in the gaming and electronics space, compared to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but this year the offering has expanded a fraction. They're not the only retailer that's offering Click Frenzy-themed discounts however, with online game marketplace Fanatical also offering a sitewide discount to coincide with the day.</p>
      <p>We'll start with the hardware and accessories from Catch, which has some bargains on Switch controllers, games, and other peripherals, a quick twist to Harvey Norman for some cheap consoles, and then we'll do a big roundup of the online stores. I'll also periodically update this post with more bargains from other retailers as they come in.</p>
