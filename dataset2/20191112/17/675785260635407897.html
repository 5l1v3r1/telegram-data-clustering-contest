      <p>EastEnders actress Tamzin Outhwaite has hinted that Mel Owen could meet a brutal end after planning to expose Sharon Mitchell.</p>
      <p>Tonight, Mel's party for Sharon and Louise is in full swing tonight as she plans to make a big announcement.</p>
      <p>Teasing tonight's action-packed episode, Tamzin said: "Mel has gone past the point of no return and she would stop at absolutely nothing to get revenge on Sharon.</p>
      <p>"Each time Sharon wrongs Mel, Mel’s determination to bring her down, builds."</p>

      <p>She added: "By revealing Sharon’s secret Mel knows it would kill Sharon and even better kill Phil. 2 birds with 1 stone! Exactly what she wants."</p>
      <p>Speaking about working with co-star Lucy Benjamin on the storyline for her final scenes, she said that it was a "perfect end" to her time on the soap.</p>
      <p>"Working with Lucy has been incredible," Tamzin said. "Initially it was all hugging and crying over Hunter and some wonderful dialogue and then it got vicious the more revengeful Mel got, the more electric the scenes felt to shoot.</p>

      <p>"We know each other well and it was a perfect end to my time at EastEnders."</p>
      <p>Tonight, Mel and Sharon will be involved in a furious car chase to the airport as they try to meet Phil there.</p>
      <p>"The car chase with Tish [Letitia Dean] was like filming a different programme as we were driving on location," Tamzin said. "Working with Tish is always the best of laughs as we laugh, we work, we talk. Just like me and Lucy. Joyous!"</p>
