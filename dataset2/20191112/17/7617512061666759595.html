      <p>A piece of infrastructure critical to the growth of the cruise-ship industry has arrived at Ogden Point.</p>
      <p>The large-diameter steel pile for the 58-metre-long mooring dolphin extension of Pier B at the Victoria Cruise Ship Terminal is a replacement for the original steel that slipped into the ocean while transiting from China in rough seas last year.</p>
      <p>The steel — 3.05 metres wide, 64 metres long and weighing 204 tonnes — will be embedded into the seabed as part of a $6.8-million project.</p>
      <p>The dolphin extension will allow for large cruise ships, close to 350 metres long, to safely moor in port. Construction will start in the next two weeks and take about five months.</p>
