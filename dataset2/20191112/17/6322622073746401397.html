      <p>(Nov 12): The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rose to record highs on Tuesday, as trade-sensitive technology stocks gained ahead of a much-awaited speech by President Donald Trump, which was likely to provide some clarity on the U.S.-China tariff talks.</p>
      <p>Hopes of a resolution to the 16-month long tariff dispute and a strong corporate earnings season have powered Wall Street's gains so far this month.</p>
      <p>All 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were trading higher, with the technology sector's 0.53% rise providing the biggest boost, followed by healthcare shares.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 0.84%.</p>
      <p>Trump is scheduled to discuss the country's trade policy at the Economic Club of New York later on Tuesday and markets are likely to hang on to every word.</p>
      <p>"There is some optimism that Trump will tell people something they like to hear, whether it's the civics or a general delay in tariffs," said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>"The focus is very much on those expectations on 'if not good news then at least the avoidance of bad news' from Trump."</p>
      <p>About three quarters of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far have topped analysts' profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>A fresh set of economic data is also expected later this week. Retail sales in October is expected to rebound from a surprise contraction in the previous month and industrial production is likely to decline by the same measure as last month.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give his comments on the domestic economic outlook this week.</p>
      <p>At 11:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 43.08 points or 0.16% at 27,734.57; the S&amp;P 500 was up 11.65 points or 0.38% at 3,098.66; and the Nasdaq Composite was up 42.67 points or 0.50% at 8,506.95.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney Co rose 1.62% as the company launched its widely awaited streaming service, Disney+. Netflix shares were down 0.6%.</p>
      <p>Rockwell Automation Inc jumped 12.5% as the factory automation equipment maker beat fourth-quarter profit expectations.</p>
      <p>CBS Corp dropped 2%, after the media company missed quarterly revenue estimates. Shares of Viacom Inc, which is merging with CBS, were also down nearly 2%.</p>
      <p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.42-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.36-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 38 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 91 new highs and 61 new lows.</p>
