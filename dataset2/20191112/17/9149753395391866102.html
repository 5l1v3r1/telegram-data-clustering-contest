      <p>Razer's Blade laptop series series of laptops have always paired sleek aesthetics with awesome performance, and typically have a substantial price tag to match. However today you can grab this year's model of the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/razer-blade-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2070-max-q-512gb-solid-state-drive-mercury-white/6349380.p?skuId=6349380">Razer Blade 15 at Best Buy for $2,199 ($400 off)</a>. </p>
      <p>Available in stunning mercury white, this gaming laptop sets itself apart from its peers by pairing an eye-catching form factor with specs that would rival some desktops. Performance of this caliber doesn't come at the cost of portability however, weighing less than 5 lbs., and is also somehow less than an inch thick.</p>
      <p>This particular model of the Razer Blade features a 1080p display that pushes a 240hz refresh rate. While some gaming laptops have hardware that can barely touch those kinds of framerates, the Razer Blade soars above the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">best gaming laptops</a> with an RTX 2070 Max-Q graphics card backed up by an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU, giving you the ability to really stretch the performance envelope.</p>
      <p>If you need to put this to the test, buying this laptop from Best Buy will also nab you a free copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to flex your shiny new RTX-enabled hardware. And just because it wouldn't be Razer without RGB, so the Blade features a full RGB keyboard as well.</p>
      <p>The Blade also comes equipped with a substantial 512GB storage capacity as well as 16GB of DDR4 memory, making it well suited for multitasking.
