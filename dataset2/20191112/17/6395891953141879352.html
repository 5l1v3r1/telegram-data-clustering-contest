      <p><b>ANN ARBOR, Mich.Â (AP)</b> - Officials say populations of fish-killing sea lamprey remain at near-historic lows in Lakes Michigan and Ontario but are above target levels in Lakes Huron, Superior and Erie.</p>
      <p>The Great Lakes Fishery Commission issued a progress report Tuesday on containing the parasitic lampreys, which invaded the lakes in the last century from the Atlantic Ocean and threatened trout and other native species.</p>
      <p>They use suction-cup mouths and razor-sharp teeth to feed on blood and body fluids of other fish, usually killing their hosts.</p>
      <p>Crews use specially designed poisons and traps to control lamprey numbers.</p>
      <p>The commission says Lake Huron populations are close to target levels and have held steady the past five years.</p>
      <p>Although above target, numbers in Superior and Erie have dropped significantly since near-record highs were observed in 2017.</p>
