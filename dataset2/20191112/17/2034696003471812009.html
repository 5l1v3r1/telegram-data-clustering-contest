      <p><i>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</i> is being written by Derek Kolstad, creator of <i>John Wick</i>, and he’s spoken a little about what to expect in a new AMA on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“In a post-blip world, while touching upon the darkness of it all, there’s got to be some resilient fun to it,” Kolstad wrote.</p>
      <p>He then confirmed that the show will be<i> </i>“totally” focused on platonic relationships between the titular heroes, saying: “There is an element of <i>Band of Brothers</i> to this by way of <i>Lethal Weapon</i>.”</p>
