      <h1>Free curry and cups of tea handed to hundreds along Soho Road for Guru Nanak birthday</h1>
      <h2>Midland Langar Seva Society organised a special 'street feed' on one of the city's busiest roads - Soho Road in Handsworth - to mark the celebration.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:56:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Sanjeeta Bains, https://www.facebook.com/sanjeetabainsbm/</a></address>
      <p>More than 334 free meals were handed out on Soho Road today to help the homeless and mark the 550th birthday of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/guru-nanak-dev-ji-550th-17229797">Guru Nanak Dev Ji</a> - the first Sikh guru.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/inspirational-mans-journey-homelessness-housing-16136858">Midland Langar Seva Society,</a> one of the biggest homeless charities in the UK, organised a special 'street feed' on one of the city's busiest roads - Soho Road in Handsworth.</p>
      <p>There were people giving out free cups of Indian masala tea,  information stalls giving a brief introduction to Sikhism and Guru Nanak and on a big red  bus, people were being served langar - curry, dahl, rice, naan bread and rice pudding while listening to live Kirtan - Sikh hymn music.</p>
      <p>Even drivers stuck on the road's legendary traffic jam were given free juice bottles in honour of Guru Nanak Gurpurab - one of the most sacred festivals in all of Sikhism. Gurpurab is the Sikh word for birthday.</p>
      <p>The charity's Guru Nanak Langar Bus was parked on Soho Road opposite Handsworth Library serving langar - food to all passersby.</p>
      <p>One man who was being served the food told BirminghamLive: "I heard about this through the society's volunteers in town - it is so good to get a nice hot meal.</p>
      <p>"I have been to the society's street feeds before - everyone is always so welcoming and warm."</p>

      <p>Another said: " I was just walking down Soho Road - when I saw the big red bus. It was good to get some shelter and enjoy a hot meal. I like the music too."</p>
      <p>The charity was built on the teachings of Guru Nanak Ji - to practice 'seva' - serving humanity and provide food and hunger relief to people in need.</p>
      <p>Guru Nanak Ji was born on April 15, 1469, and died on September 22, 1539, at the age of 70.</p>
      <p>Because <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/guru-nanak-dev-ji-550th-17229797">Guru Nanak was born at the time of the full moon (Purnima)</a> in the month of Kartika, the event is timed for the full moon in that same month each year.</p>
      <p>This year it fell on Tuesday, November 12.</p>

      <p>Surjit Singh, who is part of Midland Langar Seva Society, told BirminghamLive : "The three Sikh pillars are Nam japna: keeping God in mind at all times, Kirt Karna: earning an honest living, Vand Chhakna which literally means sharing - giving to charity and caring for others.</p>
      <p>"Guru Nanak laid these foundations for Sikhism. Although, he didn't actually create the religion - Sikhism was born in 1699, Guru Nanak was at the forefront of a different unique kind of thinking - the principles of Sikhism that we adhere to today.</p>

      <p>"Vand Chhakna - langar for all was key.  He believed everyone should be treated equally. This is why if you go into a Sikh gurdwara we sit with the congregation and eat all together and then go and pray to god. Traditionally it is about sitting on the floor - whether you're a king or a destitute homeless person.</p>
      <p>"The sharing of food while sitting together is to remove class differences and to generate humility."</p>
      <p>"We don't fast in Sikhism, like many other religions  - and that is part of Guru Nanak's teachings. He said that food and nutrition is important to make sure you can look after yourself so you can earn a living and look after your family.</p>
      <p>"If you're hungry, you can't work and so you can't earn money for you and your family.</p>
      <p>"It all links to what Midland Langar Seva Society is all about. Our bus is in Soho Road today but the bus goes round the country. We help people all over the UK - it's not just about giving them food - it's about signposting vulnerable people to services to help them get back on their feet.</p>

      <p>"MLSS is a gobal charity now but as a Midlands founded charity we wanted to do something in Birmingham - to spread the message of equality -where everyone is welcome to eat and we should all eat together. That is fundamental to Guru Nanak's teachings."</p>
      <p>The Midland Langar Seva Society serves hundreds of hot meals to homeless and poor people every day across the UK as well as India, Germany and Bangkok.</p>
      <p>It was set up in 2013 operating from the Glebe Centre in Walsall.</p>
      <p>The society, which won a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/moin-younis-fellow-winners-shine-12926346">TSB Local Pride of Birmingham Award</a> in April 2017, is a non-profit organisation that aims to help the homeless and provide food to those in need.</p>

      <p>Other events taking place today included an exhibition in Birmingham's St Philip's Cathedral.</p>
      <p>Much further afield, Sikhs have also been celebrating in Pakistan following the historic opening of the Kartarpur corridor.</p>
      <p>The 2.5 mile crossing to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur  - is where Guru Nanak spent the last 18 years of his life and is Sikhism's holiest shrines.</p>
      <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan had meant Sikh pilgrims were unable to visit the site without a visa.</p>
      <p>Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan formally inaugurated the historic Kartarpur corridor ahead of the 550th anniversary celebrations on Saturday. </p>
      <p>The Golden Temple in Amritsar, in north-western India, is the holiest Gurdwara. It was lit up to host processions as Sikh worshippers took part in three-day celebrations of Guru Nanak's birth.</p>
