      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - The Cannabis Control Commission has ordered a quarantine on all marijuana vaping products except medical use flower vaporizers. </p>
      <p>At 12:01 p.m. Tuesday, medical marijuana patients in Massachusetts were set to be able to purchase vaping products. This, after a <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/judge-rules-gov-baker-dph-overstepped-authority-in-vaping-ban/1005444298">judge ruled</a> that only the state's Cannabis Control Commission has the authority to regulate marijuana and that Governor Charlie Baker's ban was out of line. </p>

      <p>Last Thursday, the CCC chose not to uphold Baker's vaping ban for medical marijuana patients, allowing for sales for patients to begin again at 12:01 p.m. Tuesday. </p>
      <p>However, the CCC has now "issued a <a href="https://mass-cannabis-control.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191112114809266.pdf">quarantine order</a> for marijuana products and devices that rely on vaporization or aerosolization, including, but not limited to, vape pens, vape cartridges, aerosol products, and inhalers, in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Massachusetts."</p>
      <p>This means that medical marijuana patients can now purchase flower vapes again, but oil vape cartridges remain banned. </p>

      <p>This move comes days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/us-officials-identify-strong-culprit-in-vaping-illnesses/1006701777">vitamin E acetate</a> as a "strong culprit" in the nationwide outbreak of vaping illnesses.</p>
      <p>The Commission says its existing testing regulations and protocols do not require testing for vitamin E acetate. </p>
      <p>The Commission says it has "agreed to set standards for ingredients, labeling, testing, sourcing, storage of marijuana products intended for vaporization, the manufacturing and consumption processes of marijuana products and marijuana accessories, and more."</p>
      <p>It also says more information about the regulatory process "will be announced later."</p>
