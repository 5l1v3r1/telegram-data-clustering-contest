      <h1>Scotland assistant boss Dyer underlines importance of final Euro 2020 qualifiers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:14:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Scotland assistant manager Alex Dyer stressed the importance of their final two European Championship qualifiers after Andy Robertson was among three fresh withdrawals.</p>
      <p>The skipper pulled out along with Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser and Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay.</p>
      <p>Leeds skipper Liam Cooper withdrew from the squad on Monday with a slight tear in his groin, with Celtic winger Lewis Morgan and Graeme Shinnie of Derby called up.</p>
      <p>Robertson played a key role as Liverpool beat Manchester City 3-1 on Sunday while Fraser played 90 minutes as Bournemouth lost 2-1 at Newcastle on Saturday. McTominay was expected to withdraw after being carried off on a stretcher at the final whistle of United’s win over Brighton after picking up an ankle injury.</p>

      <p>With Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney already absent at the request of his club as he works his way back from long-term pelvic and groin problems, Celtic’s Greg Taylor looks set to feature at left-back despite only playing one game in the past three months.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Shinnie can also play there although he had a torrid time at his old position when Scotland lost 3-0 against Kazakhstan in their opening qualifier.</p>
      <p>That result left Scotland up against it in the group and they never recovered with a top-two finish beyond them ahead of their final two matches in Cyprus on Saturday and at home to Kazakhstan next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But Dyer has his sights set on moving up to third in Group I while building some momentum and confidence ahead of the play-offs in March.</p>

      <p>Dyer said: “It is definitely not a dead rubber. You are representing your country which is the main thing.</p>
      <p>“No matter who you play you are representing your country and you should be proud.</p>
      <p>“The second thing is they are injured they are injured, you can’t do nothing about that.</p>
      <p>“Andy is an outstanding full-back, one of the best in Europe if not the world.</p>

      <p>“So he is a good captain so you will miss him but you have other players in the squad who need to step up and will step up and do a good job.</p>
      <p>“We just have to concentrate on the ones who are here. It is part of football.</p>
      <p>“We put a squad together. There is still another round of fixtures and we know we will get some withdrawals, that’s the way it is. We just have to adapt.”</p>
      <p>Dyer insists the prospect of glory with Scotland is a key driver for him despite another failed group campaign coming to a close.</p>

      <p>The Scots have not been at the finals of a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup in France and sit in fourth place in Group I with nine points from eight games, but Nations League success last autumn has given them a lifeline via the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Assistant coach Dyer, who came in with boss Steve Clarke in March, said: “I knew it would be tough just for the history of the country, not being at finals for 20 years.</p>
      <p>“We know what the job is all about. It is a pressure you put on yourself because you want to be part of something special.</p>
      <p>“We take the job on because of that little bit of glory that you can get, that feel-good factor, the players, the supporters and the country wants, they want to get to a tournament and we want to be part of it, we want to be that group that does it. That’s why you are here.”</p>
      <p>“I grabbed this job with both hands and you want glory. You want to go away thinking, ‘look what I’ve done, I’ve been part of this’.”</p>
