      <p>It had been a tough start to the season for Racing Point but consecutive points finishes for the team since returning in Belgium has brought the team up into sixth position in the championship, 18 behind fifth placed Renault.<br/> <br/><i>“Brazil presents us with another good opportunity to score points,” </i>said Szafnauer.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“The car has been working well across a range of different tracks and I’m confident we can be just as competitive this weekend. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“It’s hard to judge our performance at the last race in the USA because it was compromised by various factors, but there’s no doubt we didn’t show our true potential.”</i><br/><i> </i><br/><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sergio-perez">Sergio Perez</a> has been Szafnauer’s man in form for the team scoring in the points at every race other than a retirement in Singapore, in which <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lance-stroll">Lance Stroll</a> picked up ninth, having not scored in the points for eight consecutive.<br/> <br/><i>“Overall, as we near the end of the season, I can say that I am pleased with our performance since the summer break,"</i> he added.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“We’ve worked hard to improve the car and scored points in all but one of the last seven races.  The point we scored in America helped move us up to sixth place in the championship and mathematically we can still aim for fifth. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“There’s lots at stake and lots to fight for, so we need to maximise the opportunities this weekend.”</i></p>
