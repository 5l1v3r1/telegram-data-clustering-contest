      <p>(CNN) - Don't you dare leave us, Chris Evans!</p>
      <p>The Marvel star sat down for a chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/chris-evans-scarlett-johansson-marvel-marriage-story-knives-out-1203399017/">"Variety Studio: Actors on Actors" </a>and revealed he often considers leaving the business.</p>
      <p>"Every couple of months, I decide I'm done acting," Evans said. "This has been my thing for decades now. I'm always looking for a way out, but I do love it."</p>
      <p>The "Captain America" actor engaged in the chat with his fellow Marvel co-star Scarlett Johansson when talk turned to what Evans was now looking to.</p>
      <p>"I think TV right now, those creative minds are given a bit more freedom," he said. "It feels like movies sometimes get inundated with studio notes, and all of a sudden, what was once an original idea becomes boiled down to the lowest common denominator, and then you have no one's favorite movie but everyone's lukewarm movie."</p>
      <p>"I think that's why people may be turning away, and looking to things like streaming service shows that actually are innovative," he added.</p>
      <p>Evans is delving into television with the new Apple TV+ limited series "Defending Jacob," based on the novel of the same name by William Landay.</p>
      <p>Johansson has been keeping busy with the films "Jojo Rabbit," "Marriage Story" and next year's "Black Widow."</p>
      <p>She joked that she, Evans and their "Avengers" co-stars needed to take a vacation in light of the success of their franchise.</p>
      <p>"We've been trying to organize this 'Avengers' vacation," Evans said. "We deserve a little victory lap."</p>
