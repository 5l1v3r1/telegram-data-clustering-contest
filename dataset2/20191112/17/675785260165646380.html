      <p>A Tory crime chief has unexpectedly quit his £85,000-a-year post amid a probe into his conduct.</p>
      <p>Jason Ablewhite resigned as Police and Crime Commissioner for Peterborough and Cambridgeshire after a complaint was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p>
      <p>No details are available about the complaint - which was made by a member of the public - have been revealed.</p>
      <p>Today it emerged that letter from the chief executive of the office of the police and crime commissioner revealed the allegations against Mr Ablewhite are of a potentially ‘criminal nature’.</p>
      <p>Mr Ablewhite, 47, has been the county's police commissioner since 2016 when he was elected to take over from fellow Conservative Sir Graham Bright.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner said: "A referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.</p>

      <p>"Jason Ablewhite has today [Monday] tendered his resignation as Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.</p>
      <p>"It would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment."</p>
      <p>An IOPC spokesman said: “The IOPC has started an independent investigation following a referral about a public complaint into the conduct of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cambridgeshire.</p>
      <p>“The investigation is in its early stages and it is too soon to speculate on the outcome.”</p>
      <p>Today it emerged that letter from the chief executive of the office of the police and crime commissioner revealed the allegations against Mr Ablewhite are of a ‘criminal nature’.</p>
      <p>According to a letter sent by the chief executive of the office of the police and crime commissioner, Dorothy Gregson, to members of the Cambridgeshire police and crime panel the allegation had been assessed as being potentially criminal.</p>
      <p>An acting commissioner will be appointed and serve until the next scheduled election for the post in May 2020.</p>
      <p>He remains a district Conservative councillor for St Ives in Huntingdonshire.</p>
      <p>Cllr Ablewhite has been contacted for comment.</p>
