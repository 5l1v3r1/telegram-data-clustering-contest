      <p><b>THE WORLD, TODAY … THE SUPREME COURT</b> is allowing victims of gun violence to sue a gun manufacturer, and at the same time seems “inclined” to let President <b>DONALD TRUMP </b>do away with <b>DACA.</b> … <b>A MAJORITY OF GEORGIA VOTERS</b> approve of the impeachment investigation into <b>TRUMP. </b>… <b>THE NEW YORK TIMES </b>has a monster story about the ties between the Turkish elite and the <b>TRUMP</b> world. … <b>ROGER STONE’S TRIAL</b> appears to be wrapping up.</p>
      <p><b>DACA UPDATE … BLOOMBERG’S GREG STOHR: “Supreme Court Justices Seem Inclined to Let Trump Cancel DACA”:</b> “Hearing arguments Tuesday in Washington, the justices suggested they will be ideologically divided in the case, with at least the five conservative justices backing the Trump administration.” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/supreme-court-justices-seem-inclined-to-let-trump-cancel-daca">Bloomberg</a></p>

      <p><b>BRIEFLY NOTED … NIKKI HALEY</b> on the <b>“TODAY SHOW”: </b>“In his mind, he thinks it was a perfect call. I think it’s never a good practice for us to ask a foreign country to investigate an American.”</p>
      <p><b>MEMO FROM THE CHAIRMAN … ADAM SCHIFF WRITES HOUSE INTEL MEMBERS ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEARINGS -- <i>Highlights:</i></b> “[O]nly Members of the Committee may participate in hearings conducted by the Committee. Although Members who are not assigned to the Committee are not permitted to sit on the dais, make statements, or question witnesses, they may of course sit in the audience. Seating for non-Committee Members wishing to attend will be available …</p>
      <p><b>“Witnesses will be sworn in before they testify</b> and will have the opportunity to deliver an opening statement. … [T]he Chair and Ranking Member may conduct at the outset of each open hearing extended rounds of questioning for periods of up to 90 minutes, as determined by the Chair and split evenly between the two sides. … [T]he Chair and Ranking Member may not yield time to other Members during these extended question periods, though either may yield time to Majority and Minority Committee Counsels, respectively. …</p>
      <p><b>“As Chairman, I expect to yield extensive </b>time to Majority Committee Counsel during the extended questioning periods … After I announce the conclusion of extended questioning, Committee Members will be recognized for customary five-minute rounds.” <b><a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191112_-_hpsci_chm_memo_to_members_on_open_hearings.pdf"><i>The memo</i></a></b></p>
      <p><b>-- ALSO NOTABLE: </b>Schiff all but says that if anyone mentions what they presume to be the whistleblower’s name, they could have an ethics investigation on their hands. House Ethics, however, is bipartisan -- five Republicans, five Democrats -- so one Republican would have to cross over to get an ethics investigation.</p>
      <p><b>SEN. RICHARD BURR</b> (R-N.C.) said the Senate’s impeachment process will take six to eight weeks. <b><a href="https://t.co/gJ4EKHeZYB"><i>The video from Wake Forest</i></a></b><i> </i>(h/t CBS’ Alan He)</p>
      <p><b>THE FLIP-FLOP … “Mulvaney won’t file lawsuit challenging impeachment subpoena,” </b>by Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio: “President Donald Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney reversed course Tuesday and opted against filing a lawsuit to determine whether he must comply with a subpoena to testify as part of the House’s impeachment inquiry. Instead, Mulvaney indicated in a court filing that he will follow Trump’s instructions to refuse giving testimony, all but ensuring Democrats will not secure his critical account before they consider articles of impeachment against the president.</p>
      <p><b>“Mulvaney’s decision comes a day after</b> he decided to drop an effort to intervene in a lawsuit seeking a judge’s ruling on the validity of the House Intelligence Committee’s subpoena for Charles Kupperman, a former Trump national security aide and close ally of former national security adviser John Bolton. Mulvaney’s lawyer, William Pittard, said late Monday that his client planned to file his own lawsuit challenging the committee’s subpoena.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/mick-mulvaney-lawsuit-challenging-impeachment-subpoena-069834">POLITICO</a></p>

      <p><b>THE ROBERTS COURT … AP’S MARK SHERMAN: “Supreme Court lets Sandy Hook shooting lawsuit go forward”: </b>“The Supreme Court said Tuesday a survivor and relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting can pursue their lawsuit against the maker of the rifle used to kill 26 people. The justices rejected an appeal from Remington Arms that argued it should be shielded by a 2005 federal law preventing most lawsuits against firearms manufacturers when their products are used in crimes.</p>
      <p><b>“The court’s order allows the lawsuit filed in Connecticut state court</b> by a survivor and relatives of nine victims who died at the Newtown, Connecticut, school on Dec. 14, 2012 to go forward.

      <p><b>“The poll found that nearly 54% of registered Georgia</b> voters approve of the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to enlist Ukraine to open investigations into his political opponents. That’s compared with 44% of voters who oppose and 2% who don’t know or refused to answer.</p>
      <p><b>“Asked whether he should be removed from office, Georgians</b> were almost evenly split: About 47% say he should be removed, about 47% say he should not, and about 6% did not answer or didn’t know.” <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/ajc-poll-georgians-support-impeachment-inquiry-split-trump-ouster/grQAEPhAanEgDiSYfqsAaL/#">AJC</a></p>
      <p><b>HOW WE GOT HERE … NYT’S DAVID KIRKPATRICK </b>and <b>ERIC LIPTON </b>in Istanbul:<b> “Behind Trump’s Dealings With Turkey: Sons-in-Law Married to Power”: </b>“One, Turkey’s finance minister, is the son-in-law of its strongman president and oversees his country’s relationship with the United States. Another is the son-in-law of a Turkish tycoon and became a business partner to the Trump Organization. Now he advocates for Turkey with the Trump administration. And the third is Jared Kushner, who as the son-in-law of and senior adviser to Mr. Trump has a vague if expansive foreign policy portfolio.</p>
      <p><b>“Operating both individually and in tandem, the three men</b> have developed an informal, next-generation line of communication between Mr. Trump and his Turkish counterpart, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. … At a moment when Mr. Trump has come under bipartisan criticism from Congress for a series of stands favorable to Mr. Erdogan, the ties among the three men show how informal and often-unseen connections between the two presidents have helped shape American policy in a volatile part of the world.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/trump-erdogan-family-turkey.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NYT</a></p>

      <p><b>THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- “Senior Trump official embellished resume, had face on fake TIME cover,” </b>by NBC’s Dan De Luce, Laura Strickler and Ari Sen: “An NBC News investigation found that Mina Chang, the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Conflict and Stability Operations, has inflated her educational achievements — like claiming, falsely, to be a Harvard grad — and exaggerated the scope of her nonprofit's work.</p>
      <p><b>“Whatever her qualifications, Chang had a key connection</b> in the Trump administration. Brian Bulatao, a top figure in the State Department and longtime friend of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, attended a fundraiser for her nonprofit in Dallas and once donated $5,500 to her charity, according to a former colleague of Chang's. Chang, who assumed her post in April, also invented a role on a UN panel, claimed she had addressed both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, and implied she had testified before Congress.” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/senior-trump-official-embellished-resume-had-face-fake-time-cover-n1080356?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">NBC</a></p>
