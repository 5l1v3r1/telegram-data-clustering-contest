      <p>TORONTO -- A senior official from the Bank of Canada says government and the private sector need to develop more ways to share information about the cybersecurity threats they're detecting on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>The central bank's chief operating officer, Filipe Dinis, says that it's necessary to defend the Canadian economy from the threat of a major cyberattack.</p>
      <p>He made the remarks in a speech to a Toronto cybersecurity conference organized by the Information Technology Association of Canada.</p>
      <p>Dinis says there have been improvements to the Bank of Canada's cybersecurity protections over the past five years -- including an operations centre in Calgary that can take over the central bank's critical functions in an emergency.</p>
      <p>But he adds the best defence for Canada's overall economy is broad collaboration and information sharing -- particularly in critical industries such as banking, telecommunications, energy and transportation. </p>
      <p>Dinis suggests that may require new regulatory frameworks or legislation in order to lower barriers that "get in the way" of collaboration between competitors and industries.<br/> </p>
