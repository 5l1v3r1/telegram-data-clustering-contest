      <p>Seattle police are investigating a shooting in the Rainier Valley and are warning motorists to expect traffic delays.</p>
      <p>Seattle Fire Department (SFD) medics transported an 18-year-old man who suffered a gunshot wound to Harborview Medical Center in stable condition, said spokeswoman Kristin Tinsley.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred around 4:20 p.m. Tuesday outside the Rainier Beach Community Center at 8825 Rainier Ave. S., north of South Henderson Street, according to SFD’s online database of 911 responses.</p>
      <p>According to Seattle police, the shooting suspects have fled the area. Detectives assigned to the department’s gang unit are investigating.</p>
      <p>In addition to traffic delays while the investigation unfolds, King County Metro announced on Twitter that it also expected transit delays because of the shooting.</p>
