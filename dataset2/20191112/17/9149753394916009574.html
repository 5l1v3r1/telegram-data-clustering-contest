      <p>As HDDs go the way of the dinosaur, SSDs have become the storage solution of choice for PC gamers due to their speed and performance. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190709221433/https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-pc//">best gaming PCs</a> all have a decent SSD that cuts down game loading times. More importantly, as game game sizes get bigger (like Call of Duty Modern Warfare's upcoming <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/modern-warfare-system-requirements/">massive 175GB download</a>) you'll need a larger model to be able to keep all your favorite games on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190709221433/https://www.pcgamer.com/best-ssd-for-gaming//">best SSDs for gaming</a>.</p>

A good mix of SATA SSDs with some obscenely huge discounts along with our choices for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-nvme-ssd/">best NVMe SSDs</a>.
