      <p>SINGAPORE: An electric scooter rider admitted on Tuesday (Nov 12) to going above the speed limit and colliding into a pedestrian.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old woman fell as a result and knocked her head on the floor, bleeding from a cut on her scalp that required stitches at the hospital.</p>

      <p>Skye Lee Shi Jia, 17, pleaded guilty to one charge of a negligent act endangering the personal safety of others.</p>
      <p>A second charge of riding a non-compliant personal mobility device on a footpath will be taken into consideration for sentencing. </p>
      <p>The court heard that Lee was 16 and a student at the time, and was working part-time delivering pizza.</p>
      <p>He rode on an e-scooter to perform his deliveries, even though the device was 740mm wide and exceeded the width limit of 700mm stated in the Active Mobility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <p>At about 6pm on May 23 last year, Lee was delivering food on his e-scooter along a footpath near Block 137, Teck Whye Lane.</p>
      <p>The victim, Toh Meng Wan, was walking along a nearby footpath.</p>
      <p>Lee was travelling at a speed of about 20kmh, above the then-prevailing speed limit of 15kmh.</p>
      <p>He did not slow down when nearing the junction, even though his view was obstructed. When he spotted the victim, he was unable to stop in time and collided with her.</p>
      <p>Madam Toh fell and knocked her head and began bleeding. Lee attended to her, applying pressure to the wound in a bid to stop the bleeding.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to hospital with a 4cm-long laceration on her scalp and bruises over her arm, ankle and head.</p>
      <p>She was given three stitches and discharged the following day with eight days' hospitalisation leave.</p>
      <p>Lee has paid her medical costs of S$488 in full as restitution.</p>
      <p>The judge called for a probation report and adjourned sentencing to Dec 10.</p>
