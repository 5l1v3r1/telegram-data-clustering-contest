      <p>Today was an exciting one for Marvel fans, as Disney+ was finally launches, with a slew of MCU favorites available to stream immediately. This includes <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, which became the highest grossing movie of all time. Obviously moviegoers are eager to have <i>Endgame</i> available to stream anytime they want (<i>Infinity War</i> is still on Netflix), and they might be surprised upon learning that one deleted scene is available on the new service. And it shows Tony reuniting with his daughter Morgan, played by <i>13 Reasons Why</i> Katherine Langford.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2460248/avengers-4-has-added-a-13-reasons-why-star">Katherine Langford's casting</a> in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> inspired countless fan theories, with many Marvel fans believing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470128/how-avengers-endgame-could-set-up-hawkeyes-partnership-with-kate-bishop">she'd play Kate Bishop</a>, Hawkeye's daughter. But it turns out she was actually an older version of Morgan, which appeared to Tony after he snapped Thanos and his forces out of existence. The scene was just revealed for the first time; you can check it out below. Or, if you'd like to check it out for yourself on Disney+, <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/410947/705874/9358">you can use this link for a free 7-day trial</a>.</p>

      <p>Well, that was powerful. Titled "Tony At The Way Station", this new clip finally reveals <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471332/katherine-langfords-cut-avengers-endgame-role-would-have-been-very-cool">what Katherine Langford shot</a> for <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. Hey, it only took a whopping seven month after the film's release.</p>
      <p>The above sequence comes to us from <a href="https://twitter.com/awarmann/status/1194270951246094336">Twitter</a>, and mirrors what happened at the end of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. After Thanos collects the Infinity Stones and snapped his fingers, he was transported to the same interdimensional setting. And while the Mad Titans spoke with a young Gamora, Katherine Langford's Morgan Stark was all grown up. The two reunite, and discuss Tony's action to sacrifice himself in order to end Thanos once and for all.</p>
      <p>Iron Man's heroic sacrifice saved the entire MCU, but it came at a great cost. No regular human was meant to wield the Infinity Stones, and the snap <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471488/theres-a-perfect-timeline-leading-to-tonys-fate-in-avengers-endgame">cost him his life</a>. This new <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> scene cues us into Tony's psyche at the time of his snap, and the doubt he had about going through with it. The main sense of guilt was for his daughter Morgan, who lost her father the day The Blip brought back half the population. Luckily, she was able to quell these concerns for him in the deleted scene, revealing she grew up to be strong. What's more, she didn't resent him for perishing.</p>
      <p>Tony's main concern with re-joining the Avengers in <i>Endgame</i> was related to Morgan. He didn't want to do anything that would change the timeline, which saw him settle down and become a father. And the good guys won, although Tony sacrificed himself in the process of the final battle.</p>

      </p>
      <p>While I thought the above scene was emotional, it also might have ruined the impact of Tony's death <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477882/tony-starks-endgame-funeral-almost-added-another-character-added-digitally">and proceeding funeral</a>. The theatrical cut expertly honored and grieved the OG MCU hero, with every major character from the shared universe assembling to put him to rest. What's more, Tony's video message to Morgan was its own emotional gut punch. And that goodbye simply wouldn't have read as well if he'd already talked to a grown up Katherine Langford's Morgan.</p>
      <p>It should be interesting to see how the MCU continues moving on without Iron Man. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477152/deadpool-2-director-david-leitch-thinks-the-third-movie-could-still-happen-in-phase-four">Phase Four</a> will kick off <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482818/scarlett-johansson-says-black-widow-gave-her-closure-after-avengers-endgame">when <i>Black Widow</i> arrives</a> on May 1st, 2020.
