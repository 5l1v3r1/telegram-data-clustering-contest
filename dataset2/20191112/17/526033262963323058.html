      <p>A U.S. soldier was killed in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/south-korea">South Korea</a> last week after his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-armored-vehicles-infantry-troops-arrive-eastern-syria/story?id=66663099">armored vehicle</a> overturned.</p>
      <p>Spc. Nicholas C. Panipinto, 20, of Bradenton, Florida, died from injuries sustained when the Bradley Fighting Vehicle overturned at Camp Humphreys on Nov. 6, the Army said in a statement. Two other soldiers were injured in the incident, <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/us-soldier-dies-two-others-injured-when-armored-vehicle-overturns-during-training-in-south-korea-1.606990">according to Stars and Stripes</a>.</p>
      <p>The accident is under investigation.</p>
      <p>Panipinto deployed as an infantryman with the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division to South Korea in July 2019. The brigade will hold a memorial for Panipinto on Friday as a way for the unit to, "say farewell to their brother in arms and honor his service to the nation," the Army said.</p>
