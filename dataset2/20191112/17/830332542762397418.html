      <p>(CNN) - Fifth time's the charm?</p>
      <p>Comedian Ricky Gervais is returning to host theÂ 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards, it was announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Once again, they've made me an offer I can't refuse," he said in a statement. "But this is the very last time I'm doing this, which could make for a fun evening."</p>
      <p>Gervais hosted -- sometimes controversially given his biting humor -- the Golden Globes 2010-12 and returned for a fourth time in 2016.</p>
      <p>The British comic can most recently be seen in the dark comedy "After Life," which he created, directs, stars in and executive produced. The Netflix series premiered March 8 and will return for a second season in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Golden Globes serve as the official kickoff for the 2020 awards season.</p>
      <p>The 25 categories, 14 in film and 11 in television, are voted on by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p>
      <p>The 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards will air live on NBC from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday, Jan. 5, 2020, starting at 8:00 p.m. ET/5:00 p.m. PT.</p>
