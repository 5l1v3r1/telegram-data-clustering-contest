      <h3>Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>The support at $9,000 failed and the price now hovers around the area at $8,600. The downward trend is something that a lot of analysts think will continue. The resistance around $8,900 is where the most recent breakout attempt came. It’s also important to consider the level the price could dip to if the 50MA is breached.</p>

      <h3>Ethereum</h3>
      <p>Against the USD, the volume is increasing and support is around $180 on the 50MA line. If it’s breached, the next support can be expected at $170. Resistance in this range is at $200 and the price breaks above it, the next one is at the 200MA around $220.</p>

      <p>Against Bitcoin, the trend continues to be positive as the support at 0.02BTC holds. Resistance is at around 0.022BTC. However, the RSI remains high and a short-term correction should also be taken into consideration.</p>

      <h3>Ripple</h3>
      <p>Against the USD, the support at 26 cents is being tested again since the last failed attempt to close above 30 cents. The destination we have marked was reached. If the price doesn’t hold, we can see a dip or a trend reversal.</p>

      <p>Against BTC, XRP is relatively stable around 3000SAT which is currently the support. Resistance is built around the 50MA line in the 3200SAT range. Following this is the 200MA around 3500SAT.</p>

      <h3>EOS</h3>
      <p>After reaching the critical level of $2.60, we saw another attempt to break above and a consequential return to support with a dip to $2.50. From here we saw another attempt to break out at the beginning of November. Resistance is being built around $3.20 and support is around $3.70.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Against Bitcoin, support around the 50MA at 0.00036BTC held and the price increased towards the resistance at 0.0004BTC where we saw two failed breakout attempts since August. The support, however, has brought back the security to the market and it appears that we are in front of a significant move.</p>

      <h3>Qtum</h3>
      <p>Against the USD, we saw a sharp increase at the beginning of November towards the impressive 200MA from the level of the Fibonacci 0.5. The support at $2.10 is fragile while resistance in this range stands at around $2.30.</p>

      <p>Against Bitcoin, the price broke out in October, reaching 0.0002BTC. From there, we saw a correction to the 0.168 Fibonacci levels and another attempt to break up with support around 0.00023BTC. In this range, the resistance is at around 0.00025BTC.</p>
