It just dropped to $90 at B&amp;H from $110 in recent days. Amazon’s price is a match of the all-time low.

Normally selling for $450 direct from JBL, today’s offer saves you as much as 66%, matches our previous mention, and is right around the all-time low. Helmed by the inclusion of built-in Google Assistant, this smart speaker will be able to command your smart home, answer questions, and so much more. Thanks to four 15W internal speakers and dual high-performance transducers, Link 500 should sound great, too. JBL notes that it can “fill large rooms with amazing stereo sound, deep bass, and clear highs.”</p>

      <h3>Bundle Nest Thermostats with Nest Hub, more from $169</h3>
      <p>BuyDig currently offers the<a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/12/nest-learning-thermostat-nest-hub-bundle/"> Nest Learning Thermostat bundled with a Google Nest Hub for <b>$249</b></a>. With the thermostat usually selling for $249 by itself, this is like getting the smart display for free instead the $100 it typically fetches. Today’s offer is one of the best values we’ve seen all-time and comes within $32 of both devices combined all-time lows. Swap in a <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/12/nest-learning-thermostat-nest-hub-bundle/">Google Home Speaker</a> for the same price. Featuring one of the more ascethically-pleasing designs on the thermostat market, Nest’s model allows you to cut back your heating bill this winter thanks to a suite of tools that help make sure your heating only runs when it needs to. Throw in the Nest Hub, and you’ll be able to take full advantage of its smart home capabilities.

      <h3>Acer Chromebook 14 sports all-day battery at $179</h3>
      <p>Walmart currently offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/12/acer-chromebook-14-walmart/">Acer Chromebook 14 1.6GHz/4GB/32GB bundled with a protective sleeve for <b>$179</b></a>. Usually selling for around $260 at <a href="https://amzn.to/2X6g32m">Amazon</a>, today’s offer beats the all-time low there by $20. That’s without factoring the sleeve’s value, which bumps the overall savings here to 33%. This is also the best we’ve tracked to date. Acer’s high-end Chromebook sports a 14-inch display, which is built into an aluminum housing. On top of that, there’s 4GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage. You’re looking at up to 12 hours of battery life per charge, and in terms of ports there’s dual USB 3.0 and HDMI.</p>
