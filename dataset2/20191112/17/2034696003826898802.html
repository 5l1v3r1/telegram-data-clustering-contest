      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/lily-allen">Lily Allen</a> has faced a barrage of criticism after calling for ‘Rule Britannia’ to be banned.</p>
      <p>The ‘Smile’ singer dissected the lyrics of the traditional anthem, which was first penned in 1740, in a series of posts on her Instagram stories.</p>
      <p>Taking aim at the track, which originated from a poem by James Thomson, she singled out the lyrics: <i>“Britons never, never, never shall be slaves. The nations, not so blest as thee, Must in their turn, to tyrants fall, While thous shalt flourish, shalt flourish great and free.”</i></p>
      <p>Allen said: “Sorry what? Britannia rule the waves… I think we should not read this song anymore.”</p>
      <p>While Allen’s criticism comes after the track was featured in last weekend’s Remembrance Day services, the idea soon faced widespread backlash.</p>

      <p>One Instagram user wrote: “You should respect the fallen, who gave you the chance to sing and make a career. It’s a song going back hundreds of years. Britain shouldn’t be slaves nor should any country. It was created when Britain did rule the waves with the largest naval fleets.”</p>
      <p>Another argued: “She should be bloody grateful. Shame on her and her inflated ego!”</p>
      <p>But others were more supportive. Defending Allen, one fan said: “Hear hear. Progress. Update. Be the country we ought to be, not the awful nation we once more.”</p>
      <p>A second fan joked: “We could sing Vindaloo instead.”</p>
      <p>Allen’s criticism of the anthem comes after critics likened it to a “Ukip rally” in 2016.</p>

      <p>In 2002, it was also removed from the repertoire at the Last Night Of The Proms in a break from tradition.</p>
      <p>Leonard Slatkin, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, subsequently claimed the choice reflected the views of the public, describing the anthem as “militaristic.”</p>
      <p>Allen is currently living in the US, having vowed not to permanently return to the UK until “Brexit is sorted”.</p>
      <p>The latest controversy comes after she backed an open letter backing Extinction Rebellion, which signed by a string of celebrities who <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/yes-hypocrites-say-artists-celebrities-extinction-rebellion-letter-2558124">admitted they were “hypocrites” for demanding change. </a></p>
