        <b>And the message came through Bale's son's school</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dick Cheney wasn’t all too happy with Christian Bale’s recent portrayal of him on the big screen, Bale has revealed.</p>
      <p>Bale played the former Vice President in 2018’s <i>Vice</i>, a role he picked up a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama for.</p>

      <p>Now, speaking to <i><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/christian-bale-dick-cheney-vice-reaction-message-220039507.html">Yahoo Entertainment</a></i>, Bale has revealed that Cheney sent a second-hand message to him via an unusual route to express his distaste for the film.</p>
      <p>“Strangely enough it was through my son’s school,” Bale remembered.</p>

      <p>“One of the moms was at a party that [Cheney] was at, and she said, ‘Oh, I’m going to be seeing Christian tomorrow, you have anything to say to him?’ And he said, ‘Tell him he’s a dick.’</p>
      <p>“I went, ’Oh, at least he’s got a sense of humour,” Bale continued. “And she said, ‘No, there was no humour to it whatsoever.'”</p>
      <p>It’s not the first war of words between the pair: when Bale accepted his Golden Globe for the film, his speech included a special dedication.</p>
      <p>“Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration on how to play this role,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/hail-christian-the-church-of-satan-salutes-christian-bales-golden-globes-victory-2427738">The stunt led the Church of Satan to thank Bale</a>, writing: “To us, Satan is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential.</p>
      <p>“As Mr. Bale’s own talent and skill won him the award, this is fitting. Hail Christian! Hail Satan!”</p>
