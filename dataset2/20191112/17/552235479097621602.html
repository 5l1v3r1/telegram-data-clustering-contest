      <h1>John Kennedy's Hibs odds tumble as Celtic coach emerges as favourite for Easter Road job</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops coach is highly respected for his work under Neil Lennon and Brendan Rodgers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:01:04+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic coach <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> has been installed as the odds-on favourite to become the new Hibs manager.</p>
      <p>The Leith side are on the lookout for a new boss after the sacking of Paul Heckingbottom.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> initially emerged as the favourite to land the vacant position at Easter Road, but an influx of cash has arrived for Kennedy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's No.2 is priced at 10/11 with Ross just in behind at 2/1 with McBookie.</p>
      <p>Harry Kewell is 4/1 after he was spotted at Hibs' win over St Johnstone at the weekend as he declared his interest for the hotseat.</p>
      <p>Neil Warnock (16/1) previously stated his desire to manage a club in Edinburgh but is set to retire after leaving Cardiff City.</p>

      <p>Nathan Jones, Steve Clarke, Alan Stubbs and Gordon Strachan are all long shots for the post.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola phoned Hibs to recommend Raul Caneda Perez as the experienced Spanish coach expressed his interest in the post.</p>
      <p>Parkhead boss Lennon admitted after his side's win over Motherwell that he isn't surprised Kennedy has been short-listed for the role but issued a hands-off warning to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> .</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>He said: "I don't want him to go for a start.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't surprise me, because he is a superb coach.</p>
      <p>"It is a feather in a cap for John if that is the case but as far as I'm concerned he won't be going anywhere, he is very integral to what we are doing here."</p>
