      <h1>Katie Price may set up 'soft porn app' to get 'revenge' on pal Danielle Lloyd</h1>
      <h2>Danielle is selling saucy snaps for £115…</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:25:36+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Brown</a></address>
      <p>They were once firm friends, attending each other's hen parties and weddings. Now, however, it appears there's no love lost between <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> and Danielle Lloyd.</p>
      <p>Katie was first said to be furious that Danielle had "copied" her surgery after having a boob job, liposuction and a Brazilian bum lift at the same Turkish clinic that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/katie-price-reportedly-heads-overseas-for-4000-worth-of-body-tweaks/">Katie visited earlier in the year</a>.</p>
      <p>Now she is said to be unhappy that Danielle has returned to her glamour modelling roots and is showing off the results of her body makeover via a paid-for app.</p>

      <p>Danielle is said to be selling "saucy" photographs for £115 and offering fans on the OnlyFans app the chance to enter a raffle to watch her in a "sexy shoot" for £12.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Katie maintains that she taught Danielle "everything she knows" and, to get her revenge, is said to want to set up her own "soft porn app" to rival Danielle's new money-making scheme.</p>
      <aside>She has bitterly claimed Danielle is a poor man’s version of her but, deep down, it’s clear she’s green with envy.</aside>
      <p>As the news broke, Katie shared a saucy throwback picture of herself to Instagram. In the shot, she can be seen wearing a skimpy bikini and a sparkly fishnet top.</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://closeronline.co.uk/celebrity/news/jealous-katie-price-revenge-danielle-lloyd/">Closer</a>: "Katie was enraged that she copied her surgery, but now she’s even angrier because she thinks Danielle’s saucy antics are an attempt to position herself firmly in the spotlight."</p>

      <p>They added: "She has bitterly claimed Danielle is a poor man’s version of her but, deep down, it’s clear she’s green with envy over how good she looks and how much attention and money she’s getting from her snaps."</p>

      <p>The pair met on the glamour modelling scene more than 20 years ago, often being pictured out on the town together.</p>
      <p>However, that's clearly not the case today, with the source adding that Katie's blood is "boiling" and revealing that she "won't let anyone trump her".</p>

      <p>They said: "She’s now considering setting up her own soft porn app to rival what Danielle is doing. She has vowed to do whatever it takes to get revenge on Danielle – even if it means posing fully naked and using her house as the UK version of the Playboy mansion to film her own content."</p>
      <p>Let's hope she has a tidy up of her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/katie-price-shows-off-mucky-mansion-on-youtube/">mucky mansion</a> before inviting the cameras in.</p>
      <p>The house was reportedly in such a state over the summer that even her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/katie-price/junior-andre-is-too-embarrassed-to-visit-mum-katie-prices-mucky-mansion/">kids wouldn't stay the night</a>.</p>
