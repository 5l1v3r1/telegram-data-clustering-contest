      <p>THE three goalkeepers on the Mayo senior football squad are set to sign for soccer clubs.</p>
      <p>Micheàl Schlingermann is seeking a return to League of Ireland football after placing his name on the PFA transfer list.</p>
      <p>Robert Hennelly will be joining Castlebar Celtic from December 1 while David Clarke is linked with a move back to Moy Villa FC.</p>
      <p>Both Hennelly and Clarke will still be available for GAA duties in 2020 but that won't be the case for Schlingermann if he signs a professional contract.</p>
