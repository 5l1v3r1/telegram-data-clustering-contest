      <p>“How do I know she’s into me?” This is the question guys have been asking themselves from time immemorial. Girls, on the contrary, have developed an elaborate sign language to let their men know how they really feel about them. But sometimes the signals women send to their men end up unnoticed and it causes the most funny and awkward situations.</p>
      <p>Here at <b>Bright Side</b> we overheard a few funny stories told by women who were sending their men the most obvious signals, but they went under the radar.</p>

      <p>After chatting for hours on top of a mountain from sunset until like 2 a.m., sharing a blanket, me leaning my head on his shoulder, telling him he’s attractive, etc. he turns to me and says, “How do you tell if a girl is into you?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@frapp-my-ccino</a></p>
      <p>He told me my hair looked nice. I said, “I bet it would look nicer with your hands in it.” He said, in a very confused tone, “...you want me to style your hair?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@CaptPizza</a></p>
      <p>When my boyfriend and I had just started dating we were laying down and watching a movie, but this was a small bed and he was being respectful and giving me space. I kept wiggling backward so I could get closer to him and he kept inching backward too, since he thought I was just trying to get comfortable and he was in the way. He ended up sitting in a chair next to the bed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@deerpajamapants</a></p>

      <p>Before we started dating, I told my current boyfriend, “I love you” and he said, “Awe, I love you too, you’re such a good friend.” The whole time we thought we were both friend-zoning each other. Wasted 6 months going in circles. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@jjdanielle511</a></p>
      <p>Him: How do I know a girl is flirting with me? Me: She touches you a lot while you 2 are talking. Him: I cannot relate at all. That never happens to me. Me, as I hit his arm: I’m sure it does! Him: I can’t think of any time that’s ever happened. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@naimeeerp</a></p>
      <p>Complained I was a little bit cold, so he gave me a blanket. I then told him there’s space for 2 under the blanket (in an obvious flirting tone). He answered with “No thanks, I’m not cold.” I still tease him with it once in a while (we’re married now). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@karamelais</a></p>

      <p>We were discussing costumes and I sent a picture of myself in my bunny suit and said that I’d need help out of it. His response was telling me that he hoped my roommate was home. I had to tell him I was implying that I’d like HIM to take it off me and it took him a minute to catch up. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@cauldronbubblesover</a></p>
      <p>Literally said, “I want to be yours” and the dude just keeps smiling and goes on about random space facts. That one hurt a little bit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@ChingchongIgotnodong</a></p>
      <p>He invited me to his house to watch a movie after a few dates. He ended up playing <i>League of Legends</i> for hours while I was lying in his bed and asked him many times if he would like to join. “Sorry just one more match.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@kaethegreat</a></p>

      <p>I once was modeling the clothes I planned to take on vacation for my boyfriend. After showing off a couple of outfits, I told him to close his eyes and changed into lingerie. He opened his eyes and I asked him what he thought. His jaw dropped and he said, “You can’t wear that outside!” I put my clothes back on. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@notrandomspaghetti</a></p>
      <p>A guy I’m currently seeing invited me camping earlier this month. We were cuddling and I noted how nice the showers are in the bathroom at the provincial park. I said “They’re really warm and there’s enough space for 2 people.” This man without missing a beat says, “Actually, you could fit like 10 people in those showers.” We laughed about it really hard the next weekend and he said, “I knew what you were getting at, but my brain just wanted to answer it logically.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@kaleywhalie</a></p>
      <p>I once invited a coworker crush over at 9 p.m. on a Sunday night. When he asked how he should get to my place, I told him to take an Uber and that he should bring clothes for work the next morning. Somehow he arrived at my apartment thinking I had invited him over to help me pick out an outfit for a first date I was going on later that week. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/?sort=confidence">@existalive</a></p>

      <p>I was living with my then-boyfriend a few years ago. Feeling a little flirtatious, I suggested we could take a shower together, you know, to save water, wink wink. His response? “Why? We don’t pay for water.” Shut. Down. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6d53vz/ladies_what_is_the_most_obvious_hint_youve/">@unknown</a></p>
      <p>My then-not-boyfriend and I were waiting at the train station for my train home. He had planned to leave with the bus after it arrived. My train came and I thought, “darn it” and kissed him on the mouth. Immediately afterward, I jumped on the train, where the doors then closed. I didn’t see his reaction nor did I feel it, so I sat on the train pretty anxious, thinking I had ruined it all. About 5 minutes later, I got a text saying: “That was meant as a friends kiss, right?” Lol, bless his heart. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6d53vz/ladies_what_is_the_most_obvious_hint_youve/">@Bimpnottin</a></p>
      <p>Me: “That suit looks great on you. It would look better on the floor.” Him: “That would wrinkle the suit.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6d53vz/ladies_what_is_the_most_obvious_hint_youve/">@Truffleshuffled</a></p>
      <p>Me: So you’re saying, if I like this guy, I should just be straightforward and ask him out? Him: Ya. Me: Ok, do you want to go out with me this Friday? Him: Ya, just like that, that was perfect. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6d53vz/ladies_what_is_the_most_obvious_hint_youve/">@Katrath</a></p>
      <p>Ladies, has something similar ever happened to you? What were the most obvious signals you sent your men that they didn’t get?</p>
