      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMl-N) has said that it would not give any return date if Nawaz Sharif goes abroad for his medical treatment.</p>
      <p>PML-N sources while commenting on removal of Nawaz’ name from ECL said court has already given him 8 weeks bail so why government is asking for his date of return.</p>
      <p>Sources added that Nawaz Sharif has already submitted surety bonds in the court.</p>
      <p>Sources said further decision would be taken after consulting the legal team, adding that the date of return would be confirmed after medical treatment of former premier starts.</p>
      <p>Earlier, it surfaced that federal cabinet is likely to approve conditional removal of former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL).</p>
      <p>Sources said that the former prime minister will have to provide guarantee to travel abroad. The federal cabinet is considering the option of submitting bonds as surety.</p>
      <p>Sources said that Nawaz Sharif’s name would be removed from the ECL if he fulfills the conditions of the Sub-Committee.</p>
      <p>The Sub-Committee has also demanded the lawyers of the PML-N supremo to handover some assets.</p>
      <p>The subcommittee will send a summary to the federal cabinet after approval of conditions from Nawaz Sharif and the committee will take final decision till 9pm.</p>
