      <p>Since her mum Debbie moved to Scotland with her little brother Jack, Sarah has been staying with her grandmother <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-charity-dingle/">Charity</a> and Charity's (now ex) fiancée <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-vanessa-woodfield/">Vanessa</a>.</p>
