      <p>Telus brings high-speed internet to Ahousaht</p>
      <p>The Ahousaht First Nation near Tofino will have access to high-speed wireless voice text and Internet service after Telus spent over $500,000 to erect a new cell site in the remote community. The tower is nearing completion, with Telus saying it should be in use in December.</p>
      <p>“This new wireless coverage means residents can call for help in the event of an accident or medical emergency, and access previously unavailable services such as consulting with a physician through the Babylon by Telus Health app,” said Shayne Draper, Telus general manager for the Island.</p>
      <p>The Babylon software gives all B.C. resident access to a symptom checker and can schedule a live video consultation with a licensed B.C. physician.</p>
      <p>Scott Fraser, minister of indigenous relations and reconciliation, said the investment means people living in Ahousaht will be connected to cellular service and improved internet access for the first time. “Better access means community members will benefit from digital tools that can increase health services, education and employment opportunities,” he said.</p>
      <p>BBB hands out Torch Awards</p>

      <p>Fish health centre increases standards</p>
      <p>The B.C. Centre for Aquatic Health Sciences in Campbell River, a private fish-health diagnostic lab, has received International Standards Organization accreditation. That means the lab can carry out four virus detecting procedures, including one for piscine orthoreovirus, to a recognized international standard, said CEO Jim Powell.</p>
      <p>First Nations RV park wins honour</p>
      <p>Salish Seaside RV Haven has been named the Business Partnership of the Year by the B.C. Achievement Foundation. The award recognizes the effort of the partners behind the enterprise, the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations, and their efforts to increase employment and training opportunities for Indigenous people and businesses.</p>
      <p>The Salish Seaside RV Haven is a project that began under the leadership of late Songhees Chief Robert Sam and late Esquimalt Chief Andy Thomas. They negotiated the purchase of the lots from Transport Canada to acquire the waterfront lands.</p>
      <p>The RV park is open year-round and caters to travellers.</p>
