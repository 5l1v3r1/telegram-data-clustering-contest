      <h1>James McClean: FA investigate Barnsley after anti-IRA chants aimed at Stoke winger</h1>
      <h2>McClean, who hails from Derry, chooses not to wear a poppy on his shirt</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-football-association">The Football Association</a> have opened an investigation into alleged discriminatory behaviour during <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BarnsleyFc">Barnsley’s</a> defeat to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/StokeCity">Stoke City</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/james-mcclean">James McClean</a>, the Stoke and Republic of Ireland winger, was regularly booed and subjected to sectarian chanting by a section of the home crowd at Oakwell.</p>
      <p>Anti-IRA and anti-Pope songs were directed at McClean, who hails from Derry, where British soldiers shot 28 unarmed civilians on Bloody Sunday in 1972, killing 13.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the referee Jeremy Simpson included an allegation of discriminatory behaviour in his match report, leading to the FA’s investigation.</p>
      <p>The meeting between the two Championship strugglers came on the eve of Remembrance Sunday, with a minute’s silence held before the game and both sets of players wearing poppies of their shirts. </p>
      <p>McClean chooses not wear a poppy as it commemorates all British military personnel and he believes it would be disrespectful to the victims of Bloody Sunday and others who lost their lives in The Troubles.</p>
      <p>In a statement released last year, McClean said: “I know many people won’t agree with my decision or even attempt to gain an understanding of why I don’t wear a poppy.</p>
      <p>“I accept that but I would ask people to be respectful of the choice I have made, just as I’m respectful of people who do choose to wear a poppy.”</p>
      <p>McClean was targeted by his own supporters last year for not wearing the poppy during Stoke’s goalless draw with Middlesbrough.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old described the fans in question as “uneducated cavemen”, adding: “They have nothing in their whole imperial arsenal that can break the spirit of one Irishman who doesn’t want to be broken.”</p>
