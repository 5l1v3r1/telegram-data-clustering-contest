        <b>Legendary Australian cricketer Adam Gilchrist believes that the Kangaroos are in prime shape heading into next year's World T20 and fancies Aaron Finch's mean heading into next year's global showdown. Gilchrist also lavished praise on Tim Paine for stabilizing Australian cricket in times of trouble.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For a team that thrives on big-hitting and for a team that has, throughout the course of the past decade, produced world-class T20 cricketers, it is indeed baffling that the only <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a> trophy that has evaded the Australian cricket team is the T20 World Cup. But with the tournament set to be held at home next year, Australia will, arguably, have their best chance to add the WT20 trophy and have taken the first step towards doing so by finishing the calendar year 2019 unbeaten in T20I cricket.</p>
      <p>Adam Gilchrist, who has been a part of three successful ODI campaigns for Australia, feels that the Men in Yellow are extremely well-placed heading into next year's showdown and believes that home advantage will play a major part in helping the Kangaroos in their quest to win the T20 World Cup.</p>
      <p>"I think they are really well-placed seeing how they've started the summer. They'll love the conditions, they love the grounds, they're bigger grounds, they'll play them well," Gilchrist was quoted as saying by Times of India.</p>
      <p>"We got everyone available now, which is great. I think Australia is, probably for the first time ever, focusing on picking their best team regularly and not just for the World Cups," he added.</p>
      <p>The former wicket-keeper batsman believes that Australia are still figuring out their best combination, but is happy with the re-emergence of Ashton Agar and feels that spin will play a key part in the tournament. Gilchrist also feels that Australia have a very well-balanced squad heading into next year's WT20.</p>
      <p>"I think they're probably still working out whether to use two spin bowlers or one spin bowler and a batting all-rounder like Mitch Marsh or (Marcus) Stoinis.</p>
      <p>"Ashton Agar is doing a really good job, and if you look at all the successful bowlers in T20 around the world, they're all spinners. Nine out of the top 10 in the rankings are spinners. They've got time to work that out but I think they have got a really well-balanced squad," Gilchrist opined. </p>
      <p>One of the raging debates in Australian cricket of late has been how long Tim Paine should continue as captain, with several experts suggesting <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/steve_smith">Steve Smith</a> to be reinstated as captain as soon as his ban ends. But Gilchrist believes that Paine has well and truly earned his spot in the team and has backed the Tasmanian to carry on as captain for the forseeable future. He also lauded Paine's glovework and feels that the 34-year-old is the best wicket-keeper in the country. </p>
      <p>"I still think in test cricket you've got to be looking to pick your best wicket-keeper. Like every player he's got to hold his spot in the team. As far as being selected as the best available option for that player-type, I think he's doing a wonderful job. </p>
      <p>"What he took on, when he took it on, he in partnership with (coach) Justin (Langer) and all the players over the past 12 months have done a remarkable job to just get a nice, stable balance back. I can't see any rush to push him out, as long as he's still performing, like we all had to, to stay in the team," Gilchrist signed off. </p>
