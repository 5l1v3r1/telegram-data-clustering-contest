        <b>Chiefs Dominate In The Air</b>
      </p>
      <p>Early in this game, Amakhosi were extremely dangerous and dominant in aerial battles against a Pirates defence missing Happy Jele and Mthokozisi Dube through suspension and Thabiso Monyane to South Africa under 23 duty. The own goal came from a long throw, the second goal from a corner, and Chiefs had other good openings from headers for target men, Samir Nurkovic and Leonardo Castro. The Serbian striker won six aerial duels by the end of the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pirates Use Pace Up Front</b>
      </p>
      <p>After seeing the impact of Gabadinho Mhango as a substitute in last week’s Telkom Knockout clash, Rulani Mokwena played the speedy forward from the start. After a tough opening period as a striker, he moved wide to a left winger role and caused all sorts of problems for Chiefs, setting up a clear chance for Thembinkosi Lorch and then scoring by cutting inside. Mhango also won the free-kick from which Vincent Pule scored. Lorch and Pule both joined the Malawian in attack and the front three had no defensive duties besides pressing and could focus on attacking a slow Amakhosi rear-guard. </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lopsided Bucs Shape</b>
      </p>
      <p>An average position map showed that Pirates focused most of their attacks down the left and rarely attacked up the right, with no right winger used and Abel Mabaso staying back to provide defensive cover from right back. Pirates delivered 17 crosses in open play with a massive 14 coming from the left flank. </p>
      <p>Part of the reason for this strategy could be that Pirates wanted to keep Reeve Frosler too busy defensively to get forward, whilst they were not concerned by Yagan Sasman’s attacking threat on the other side. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Middendorp Subs Stop The Bleeding</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just as Pirates threatened to go in front, Chiefs stopped the pressure they were under somewhat by bringing on Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya and Bernard Parker to dovetail on the right flank. That brought some more defensive control to stop Mhango and Paseka Mako, before Parker won the crucial penalty. </p>
