      <p>City suffered a 3-1 defeat to title rivals Liverpool on the weekend, in a match that saw the Reds benefit from several contentious decisions, and Guardiola was left angered by VAR's failure to intervene.</p>
      <p>Following the match, former striker Trevor Sinclair told <i>talkSPORT</i> he believes the former FC Barcelona boss will leave the Premier League if VAR is not used more consistently.</p>
      <p>"Pep wants clarity to what the rules are, because at the moment, the fans, players and managers haven't got a clue," Sinclair said.</p>
      <p>"This is my fear, that if this continues, managers like Pep and the best players are going to start leaving the Premier League.</p>

      <p>"If it continues to be this inconsistent, people are going to start leaving the Premier League and go to different leagues. I think Pep is right on the cusp.</p>
      <p>"The Premier League is so good because we get the very best managers who attract the very best players.</p>
      <p>"If you want to go to a top club, you look at who the manager is there. That's how City have got the players they have got – because of Pep.</p>
      <p>"Now, if managers start leaving the Premier League because there's no consistency and it's a flawed system, I think they're (the league) in danger of ruining what they've produced over the last 25 years in the Premier League."</p>
