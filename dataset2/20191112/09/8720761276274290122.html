      <p>The U.S. military may have finally found a way to fix a glitch with the world's most high-tech helmet used by pilots flying the most expensive fighter jet in history. From a report:<i> A bug in the $400,000 helmet display screen used by F-35 aviators caused a green glow when flying in very low-light conditions and is now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-10/pentagon-gets-a-fix-for-f-35-bug-in-400-000-pilot-helmets">expected to be overcome by using a different type of semiconductor illumination</a>. The distracting green glow was deemed so critical that restrictions were imposed on some night landings on aircraft carriers, and the fault was classified as a "Priority One" fix by the Pentagon's test office. Jittery lines were also visible to some pilots. Defense giant Lockheed Martin has been contracted by the F-35 Joint Program Office for the redesign, modifying headpieces by installing new organic light-emitting diodes to replace traditional liquid crystal displays. "In partnership with the F-35 Joint Program Office and our U.S. Navy customer, we've been working to transition the helmet technology from a traditional LCD to an Organic LED system," Program Manager Jim Gigliotti said by email. Lockheed Martin did not provide a figure for the number of helmets requiring modification or the upgrade cost.</i></p>
