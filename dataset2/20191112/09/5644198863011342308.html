      <p>RIYADH: A Yemeni man stabbed three performers during a live play in the Saudi capital Monday (Nov 11), police said, in the first such attack since the ultra-conservative kingdom began easing decades-old restrictions on entertainment.Â </p>
      <p>The assailant was arrested after state television footage showed him stomping onto the stage in Riyadh's King Abdullah Park during a musical performance by what appeared to be a foreign theatre troupe.</p>

      <p>"Security forces dealt with a ... stabbing attack against two men and a woman from a theatre group during a live performance," a police spokesman was quoted as saying by the official Saudi Press Agency.</p>
      <p>Police said the man arrested was a 33-year-old Yemeni expatriate and that the knife used in the attack was seized.</p>
      <p>The statement added the victims were in stable condition but offered no information about their nationality or the motivation of the assailant.</p>
      <p>The King Abdullah Park is one of the venues hosting the two-month "Riyadh Season" entertainment festival, part of a broad government push to open up the austere kingdom to tourists and diversify its economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>The country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced stunning reforms including allowing concerts, re-opening cinemas and lifting a ban on women driving as part of a contentious liberalisation drive.</p>
      <p>In scenes that were unimaginable just two years ago, Saudi Arabia has staged glitzy performances by a host of international artists, from South Korean boy band BTS to pop icon Janet Jackson and rapper 50 Cent.</p>
      <p>But Saudi officials warn that introducing such reforms in a society steeped in conservatism is fraught with peril.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"COLLISION COURSE"</b>
      </p>
      <p>While they are wildly popular among Saudi Arabia's majority young population, the reforms risk angering arch-conservatives, including hardline clerics and the religious police whose powers have been clipped in recent years.</p>
      <p>"The risk of this sort of attack against the recent introduction of public entertainment, which many clerics have been inciting against, is a key reason (the government) has pursued a zero tolerance policy towards their public attacks against change and reform," Saudi analyst Ali Shihabi said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, human rights campaigners reported the arrest of religious scholar Omar al-Muqbil after he criticised the Saudi General Entertainment Authority for hosting such concerts, saying they were "erasing Saudi society's original identity".</p>
      <p>"Liberals and conservatives in the kingdom are on a collision course and that probably worries Saudi leaders the most," Quentin de Pimodan, a Saudi expert at the Greece-based Research Institute for European and American Studies, told AFP.</p>
      <p>"After this attack we can expect a sharper crackdown on those opposed to Saudi's entertainment push."</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia has already drawn international censure for its sweeping crackdown on critics, including clerics, intellectuals and women activists.</p>
      <p>The kingdom has faced international scrutiny over its human rights record since last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>Developing the tourism and leisure sector is one of the foundations of Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 plan to prepare the Arab world's largest economy for the post-oil era.</p>
      <p>The General Entertainment Authority has said it plans to pump US$64 billion into the sector in the coming decade.</p>
      <p>Some Saudis, however, view the push for entertainment as an attempt to blunt public frustration over an economic downturn and high youth unemployment in the petro-state.</p>
