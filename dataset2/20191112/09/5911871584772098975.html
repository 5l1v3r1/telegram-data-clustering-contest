And there are some non-instrumental tracks from Calvi, including an as-yet-unheard cover of FKA Twigs' &quot;Papi Pacify&quot; and a new original called &quot;You're Not God.&quot; The latter Calvi track is out today. It's a rock song with lumbering swagger and piercing noise, toggling between a heavy groove and long passages of near-silence.
