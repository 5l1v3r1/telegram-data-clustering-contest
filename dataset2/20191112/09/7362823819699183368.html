      <p><b>Good morning and welcome to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/columns/fox-news-first">Fox News First</a>.</b> Here's what you need to know as you start the day ...</p>
      <p><b>GOP's plan to defend Trump revealed ahead of public impeachment inquiry hearings</b><br/>Top Republicans serving on panels involved in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump penned a memo to GOP members on those committees outlining "key points of evidence" from the closed-door inquiry ahead of public hearings slated to begin Wednesday. The memo to the GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Oversight Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-memo-outlines-partys-plan-to-defend-trump">outline arguments in defense of Trump</a>.</p>

      <p>They make the case that Democrats failed to present any evidence of quid pro quo in Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They said Trump had a “deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine and U.S. taxpayer-funded foreign aid" due to the country's history of "pervasive corruption" since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Conservative radio talk show legend Rush Limbaugh has warned Trump supporters to expect Democrats to employ a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rush-limbaugh-democrats-kavanaugh-impeachment-hearings">strategy similar to the one they used against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh</a> during his confirmation hearings last year. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-memo-outlines-partys-plan-to-defend-trump"><b>Click here for more on our top story.</b></a></p>

      <p><b>Showdown over Trump's bid to end Obama's 'Dreamer' program goes before Supreme Court</b><br/>The long-running battle over the Trump administration’s bid to end the Obama-era program for young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/daca-lands-before-supreme-court-showdown-over-trump-bid-to-end-dreamer-program">will land before the Supreme Court on Tuesday</a>. With a ruling expected in the midst of a presidential election year, the case puts the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues since the start of President Trump’s term.</p>

      <p>For the administration and Dreamers alike, it all comes down to the Supreme Court, where Trump picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch now sit. Federal appeals courts across the country have rejected efforts to phase out the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but the administration has looked to the high court for support. Legal experts say <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/daca-heads-to-supreme-court-and-all-eyes-are-on-chief-justice-john-roberts">look closely at Chief Justice John Roberts</a>, who could be the tie-breaker in the case. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/daca-lands-before-supreme-court-showdown-over-trump-bid-to-end-dreamer-program"><b>Click here for more.</b></a></p>
