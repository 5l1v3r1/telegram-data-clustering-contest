      <p>Nadine Coyle has arrived Down Under ready for her I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! stint.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old former Girls Aloud singer was spotted arriving at Brisbane Airport ahead of Sunday night's launch show.</p>
      <p>She joins Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Andrew Maxwell, Jacqueline Jossa, James Haskell, Roman Kemp, Kate Garraway and Myles Stephenson for the 2019 series.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of her bug-infested trip to the jungle, Nadine said she was fed up of being scared of everything, believing it was the birth of her daughter Anaiya that caused her to lose her gutsy attitude to life.</p>
      <p>"I really want to try something completely new. I am scared of so many things," she confessed.</p>

      <p>"I used to be brave. In the past, I've opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these. Now I have got so fearful even being in the car, flying or general things. I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid."</p>
      <p>Nadine went on: "I really hope that by doing this, it pushes me so far out the comfort zone and that I learn to be comfortable, feel relaxed and do the things that I didn't used to be afraid of."</p>
      <p>If she survives the first round of voting, it will be the longest time Nadine has ever spent away from her daughter.</p>

      <p>"I have been away for ten days for work before but not longer," she said.</p>
      <p>"I am dreading being away from everybody and not being able to phone and say 'how are you doing?' 'How is my daughter?'.</p>
      <p>"I am excited but it also feels like a dream still. I know it is going to be a whole different story when I get out there!"</p>
      <p>It comes as ITV bosses hope Nadine will spill the beans on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/drugs-rows-backstabbing--inside-15422174">the infamous Girls Aloud feud</a> , which saw her and Sarah Harding fall out with Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh in 2013.</p>
      <p>According to reports from around the time of the girl group's split, Cheryl and Sarah were the first to cause a rift.</p>

      <p>While Sarah loved to party - and later admitted she had an addiction to prescription painkillers - Cheryl rarely drank and preferred an early night.</p>
      <p>As the pair begun to bicker, the group split down the middle, with Sarah and Nadine separating one way while Cheryl, Kimberly and Nicola formed a trio.</p>
      <p>"So yeah there was [a divide]. We’re all very, very different characters," Nadine once told The Sun as she reflected on the frosty dynamics.</p>
      <p>"It’s so sad for me to have to admit this stuff now because for so long, there’s the band, and you want everybody to think we’re best friends and we have pillow fights and, you know, drink milkshakes.</p>
      <p>"That's what I wanted it to be. I really, really wanted that to be, but it just wasn't how it was."</p>

      <p>But it was reportedly in 2013, when the group made the decision to call it a day, that things really shattered between them.</p>
      <p>Nadine maintains that she wasn't consulted, and was only told moments before the announcement, after the girls grouped up and decided without her.</p>
      <p>With betrayal still ripe in the air, the group didn't talk for a while after their last gig, and the tension between them was hitting the headlines.</p>
      <p>Nadine went on to publicly slam their decision to quit, and Cheryl clapped back that she was "full of s**t" during an interview in Attitude magazine.</p>
      <p>While Sarah reached out and apologised to Nadine for leaving her out of the decision, and they put any drama to rest, it was evident to fans that the five singers were no longer the best of pals.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Cheryl and Kimberly reunited with Nicola at her 30th birthday party – but the other girls didn't get a look in.</p>
      <p>And ever since, the trio have regularly met up without their other two band-mates - meaning Nadine will have plenty of gossip to drop in the jungle.</p>
