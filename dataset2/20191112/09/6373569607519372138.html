      <h1>Relocation of Plymouth Argyle season ticket holders to £8m-plus Mayflower Grandstand gets under way</h1>
      <h2>It will be open for the first time when Derek Adams brings Morecambe to Home Park next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:44:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle season ticket holders are being invited to relocate to the Mayflower Grandstand, which reopens next month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">After an £8 million-plus, 18-month renovation</a>, it will be open to 50 per cent of its 5,403-seat capacity for the League Two game against Morecambe on Saturday, December 14.</p>
      <p>That match will mark the first return to Home Park of former Pilgrims’ boss Derek Adams, who was appointed as Morecambe manager last week.</p>
      <p>Letters from Argyle chief executive Andrew Parkinson were sent out on Tuesday to supporters who held a 2017/18 season ticket.</p>
      <p>They are being offered the chance to relocate to the grandstand to a seat as close as possible to the one that they vacated.</p>
      <p>Supporters are unlikely to be given an identical seat number to the one that they previously held.</p>
      <p>That is because the seat numbering runs the opposite way to before, so seat one is at the Devonport End of the grandstand, for example.</p>
      <p>Argyle have a team of staff members ready to assist supporters with their relocation inquiries.</p>
      <p>The club has also set up a dedicated email address <a href="mailto:grandstand@pafc.co.uk">grandstand@pafc.co.uk</a> to help make the process as smooth as possible.</p>
      <p>Supporters can also call 01752 907700 or visit the Home Park Ticket Office to discuss their seat migration.</p>
      <p>The grandstand will be open to 75 per cent of its capacity – 4,050 seats – for the league game against Stevenage on Sunday, December 29.</p>
      <p>It will then be fully open, taking the Home Park capacity up to 18,200, when Swindon Town are Argyle’s opponents on New Year’s Day.</p>
