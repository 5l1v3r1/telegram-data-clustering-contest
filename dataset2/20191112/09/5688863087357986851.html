        <b>After a humbling loss to Liverpool, Manchester City are ready to spend atleast £100 million in the winter window to help them catch up to their title rivals. After just 12 league games, the Cityzens sit nine points off the Reds with Leicester City and Chelsea in second and third place respectively.</b>

      <p><a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_city">Manchester City</a> are set for a January transfer spree, reports the Mirror, with the Cityzens set to spend in excess of £100 million. This comes just after a humbling 3-1 loss to Liverpool despite the away side dominating the football pitch for large parts of the match. That, combined with a myriad of injury issues, has seen <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/pep_guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> ask the club’s board for reinforcements, the Mirror has reported.</p>
      <p>The report further added that a replacement for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/david_silva">David Silva</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/sergio_aguero">Sergio Aguero</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/vincent_kompany">Vincent Kompany</a> are at the top of the shortlist despite their business over the summer window. However, the Daily Mail has further added that a Kompany replacement is their main priority with the others coming second after injuries and various other issues have seen Guardiola consider a new partner for Laporte.</p>
      <p>The report further added that the Manchester City board are trying to make sure that their squad does not decline and will also target contract re-negotiations over the next few months. That list, while not confirmed, should include <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/raheem_sterling">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/ilkay_gundogan">Ilkay Gundogan</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/kevin_de_bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a>, with an extension for Pep Guardiola also being discussed. The Spaniard has been linked with a move to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bayern_munich">Bayern Munich</a> but the Daily Mail has reported that he will see out the rest of his 18-month deal.</p>
