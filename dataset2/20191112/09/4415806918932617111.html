      <p>Deliveroo wants Irish employment laws to change so it can offer its riders benefits such as sick pay.</p>
      <p>More than 5,000 people in Ireland have delivered food for the company since it began operating here in 2015.</p>
      <p>Research carried out by the company shows most of its riders work less than 15 hours a week, and say it is important that they can choose their own working hours.</p>
      <p>Deliveroo's General Manager Michael Healy says they want to offer contractors additional benefits without compromising their employment status:</p>
      <p>"If you change the employment status, we remove the flexibility that they so desire," he said.</p>
      <p>"If we were to offer them sick pay... we would have to guarantee a minimum number of hours and take away the flexibility which is literally the number one reason they work with Deliveroo."</p>
