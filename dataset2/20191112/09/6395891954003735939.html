      <p>A "Jeopardy!" contestant's heartwarming tribute to Alex Trebek prompted an emotional response from the show's longtime host – and many viewers, as well.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/11/jeopardy-alex-trebek-chokes-up-over-sweet-answer-we-love-you-alex">According to USA Today</a> and <a href="https://www.gainesvilletimes.com/life/people/we-heart-you-alex-gainesvilles-dhruv-gaur-ends-jeopardy-run-with-note-to-host/">the Gainesville Times</a>, the moment came during Monday night's Tournament of Champions episode as Brown University student Dhruv Gaur, of Gainesville, Georgia, revealed his Final Jeopardy response. </p>
      <p>"You're smiling. I like that," Trebek, who is battling pancreatic cancer, told the grinning 18-year-old. "Let's take a look at your response. Did you come up with the right one?"</p>
      <p>But Gaur had not. </p>
      <p>"What is, 'We love you, Alex,'" Trebek read from Gaur's blue screen. "That's very kind. Thank you."</p>
      <p>The 79-year-old then paused and took a deep breath, appearing to hold back tears before unveiling Gaur's wager.</p>
      <p>"Cost you $1,995," Trebek continued, still visibly emotional. "You're left with $5."</p>

      <p>"For context, Alex had just shared with us that he was re-entering treatment for pancreatic cancer.

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/dhruvg_/status/1194073687156285442">He added</a>: "I'm just very grateful I got the opportunity to say what I know everyone was thinking. Sending all the love."</p>
