      <h1>Sinas: Drug-using cops have no place in NCRPO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:33:59+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/alfred-p-dalizon" target="_blank">Alfred P. Dalizon</a></address>
      <h3>HE ordered the dismissal of at least nine Central Visayas policemen who tested positive for substance abuse last year and as the new head of the National Capital Region Police Office, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas warned that drug-using policemen have no place in the Metro Manila police force.</h3>
      <p>The member of Philippine Military Academy ‘Hinirang’ Class of 1987 said that since he assumed the top NCRPO post from his mistah, Major Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo T. Eleazar who is now the Philippine National Police Chief Directorial Staff, two NCRPO personnel have tested positive for illegal drug use and are now undergoing summary dismissal proceedings.</p>
      <p>The two were identified as Corporal Sonny Florence and Patrolman Darwin Resurecion.  Florence initially tested positive for shabu during a screening test and an ensuing confirmatory test.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Resurecion tested positive for marijuana use during a screening and confirmatory test.</p>
      <p>Sinas said that he has ordered the continuing conduct of random drug testing among all personnel of the NCRPO regional headquarters and its five districts and numbered police stations in order to ferret out policemen who are into illegal drug use specifically rogue anti-narcotics agents who are ‘recycling’ seized drug evidence.</p>
      <p>“I’m reminding our policemen that drug testing will continue. If ever you are using drugs you better stop or you would suffer the same fate as Florence and Resurecion. I’m telling you I would not hesitate to dismiss drug-using Metro Manila policemen as there are so many applicants ready to replace them,” the official told the Journal Group.</p>
      <p>As PRO7 director in Central Visayas, Sinas dismissed nine of his men who had the ranks of Patrolman to Master Sergeant after they tested positive for substance use.</p>
      <p>The nine tested positive in drug tests held in 2018 and 2019 and have been relieved from their post since then.</p>
      <p>Sinas said that apart from  being dismissed from police service, these ex-cops will also be facing administrative charges and a case for violating  Section 11 of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.</p>
      <p>The NCRPO director said that as part of their ongoing internal cleansing program,  surprise drug testing will continue in the metropolitan police force in partnership with the PNP Crime Laboratory. Sinas also used to be a PNP-CLG director.</p>
      <p>Weeks before he was installed by PNP Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa as NCRPO director, Sinas was lauded by Gamboa for his ‘very good leadership and incomparable accomplishments as PRO7 Regional Director’ starting in June 2018.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said that under the command of Sinas, the accomplishments of the Police Regional Office 7 stand as a challenge, a gauge to other regional headquarters.</p>
      <p>Under Sinas, the PRO7’s anti-criminality specifically anti-drug operations increased from 5,688 to 6,857 in 2017.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the PRO7 arrested 5,281 felons and seized more than P400 million worth of shabu from P300 million in 2017. A total of 79 armed suspects were also killed in gunbattles with the local police in 2018.</p>
      <p>Sinas said he is making big adjustments as the Metro Manila police director since NCRPO is a much larger police force with almost 20,000 policemen compared to the much smaller Central Visayas police. Add to that the fact that Metro Manila has a much bigger population.</p>
      <p>The official said ‘we will walk the talk’ when he issued a series of directives which called on his men to pursue their unrelenting drive against illegal drugs, criminality and rogues in uniform and at the same time implement a ‘no-take’ policy on all illegal gambling or any other criminal activities.</p>
      <p>However, he stressed he would be implementing all effective policies of Eleazar. “I don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Hopefully, I can match my classmate’s accomplishments,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sinas has enforced a ‘No-Take’ policy in the Metro Manila police force and banned his men from playing golf during weekdays.</p>
      <p>A known disciplinarian who strictly enforced discipline at the PNP national headquarters in Camp Crame when he was still the PNP Secretary to the Directorial Staff, Sinas said that he wants his men to strictly observe discipline inside police camps and all police stations and precincts in Metro Manila.</p>
