      <p>The arts and music festival makes its triumphant return this year, and it’s all happening on the weekend of 23-24 Nov. The fourth installment of the festival sees the Grammy-winning group <b>Mumford and Sons</b> and Grammy-nominated songstress <b>Halsey </b>headlining on Saturday and Sunday respectively, accompanied by an exciting lineup of local and international favorites.</p>

      <p>A whole bunch of performers from different genres will be in attendance, and electronic fans will especially be spoilt rotten. Everyone who’s anyone in the scene will be there, from <b>Nick Murphy fka Chet Faker</b> and <b>Clean Bandit, </b>to pop duo <b>HONNE </b>— who are returning to our sunny shores for the third time. <b>Aurora</b> and her hauntingly beautiful voice also make an appearance.</p>

      <p>Singer-songwriter <b>Gus Dapperton</b> and electronic acts <b>Mura Masa</b> and <b>Joan</b> will also be making their Singaporean debut on the Neon Lights stage. That’s not all, as the +65 is well represented too, with acts such as folk-blues set-up <b>Shak &amp; the Baits</b>, funk band <b>MMLD</b>, the lively <b>Mariachi Viva Mexico </b>and percussion group <b>Bloco Singapura</b> set to perform. Also recently announced is the indie quartet <b>Disco Hue</b>, who are set to rock the main stage.</p>

      <p>When you’d like to take a break from the action, you can kick off your dancing shoes and participate in the myriad of activities on offer. Neon Lights is more than just about the music, and this year is no different. Step away from action and immerse yourself in fun activities such as <b>Neon Nooks</b>, featuring South African visual artist <b>Francois Knoetze </b>and <b>Aliens of Manila x Singapore</b> and of course, <b>Silent Disco Asia </b>which returns to the festival this year. Festivalgoers will be plied with a selection of gourmet food and drinks as well.</p>
      <p>The little ones will also have no shortage of things to do, with the return of <b>Neon Kids</b>, which sees the introduction of a <b>Silent Disco Kids Edition</b>, <b>Aliens of Manila Sci-Fi Helmet Workshop</b>, and the return of the <b>Sideshow Garden Games</b>.</p>
