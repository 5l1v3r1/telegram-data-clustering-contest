      <p>Kerry Katona was left reeling after her young daughter told her that friends at school had branded the Atomic Kittens singer a "cokehead".</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old mum of five slammed gossipping mums and dads for talking about her previous addition issues, saying children of her daughter's age should not know about her lurid past.</p>
      <p>"[She] came home a couple of weeks ago saying one of the kids in her class had called me a cokehead," Kerry wrote in her New magazine column.</p>
      <p>"How do kids of [that age] know about my drugs past from over a decade ago? It goes to show the parents are talking about me to their children.</p>

      <p>"I didn't know what a cokehead was at that age and I don't think the kids in [her] class should be aware of my problems," she went on.</p>
      <p>"[She] is defensive of me, but I've always been open about it with my kids, so they know the truth."</p>
      <p>Kerry became addicted to drugs at the age of 14, after her alcoholic mum gave them to her saying Kerry should try her "sherbet dip".</p>
      <p>Years of cocaine abuse, toxic relationships and her bipolar diagnosis saw Kerry brought to the brink of suicide, unsure how she was still even alive.</p>

      <p>Speaking of using cocaine as a crutch, Kerry said earlier this year: "I call it devils <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/how-rid-dandruff-treatments-cure-12193094">dandruff</a> because it's toxic, it’s manipulating, it gives a false sense of security, it’s not really there for you, it's ruining you.</p>
      <p>"It's an escapism. Taking coke is better than facing the scariest thing going on in your life. You're constantly chasing that buzz and you don't want the come down. The downers are awful."</p>
      <p>She added: "After taking drugs I used to have fits. My eyes would roll back and I'd be frothing at the mouth.</p>

      <p>"I could have died, I could have chocked on my own tongue, my own saliva."</p>
      <p>Kerry's abusive ex-husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kerry-katona-breaks-silence-over-18777920">George Kay died in July this year</a> from a drug overdose at the age of 39.</p>
      <p>George, who shared daughter DJ with Kerry, died after eating cocaine off the desk of a Holiday Inn hotel in Cheshire, watched by horrified staff.</p>
