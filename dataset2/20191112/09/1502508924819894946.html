      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>will, on Wednesday, pronounce the verdict on whether or not the office of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chief-justice-of-india">Chief Justice of India </a>comes under the ambit of Right to Information (RTI) Act.</p>
      <p>The order will be passed by a five-judge Constitution bench of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justices NV Ramana, DY Chandrachud, Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna on a petition filed by a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>Secretary-General challenging the January 2010 judgment of the Delhi High Court.</p>
      <p>The High Court in its order had declared the CJI's office a "public authority" and said that it should come under the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rti-act">RTI Act.</a></p>
      <p>The bench had reserved the order on April 4. Chief Justice Gogoi had earlier observed that in the name of transparency, one cannot destroy the institution.</p>
      <p>In November 2007, an RTI activist Subhash Chandra Aggarwal had filed an RTI in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>seeking information on judges' assets but the information was denied.</p>
      <p>Aggarwal then approached the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/central-information-commission">Central Information Commission </a>(CIC) which asked the apex court to disclose information on the ground that the Chief Justice of India's office comes within the ambit of the Act.</p>
      <p>In January 2009, a plea was moved in the Delhi High Court against the CIC order but the same was upheld.</p>
