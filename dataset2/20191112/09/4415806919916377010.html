      <p>The Crown star Tobias Menzies has said he remains “republican” despite his new royal role.</p>
      <p>He stars as the Duke of Edinburgh in the upcoming series of the Netflix show.</p>
      <p>Despite getting to know his character and the nature of blue-blooded responsibilities, he does not support the monarchy.</p>
      <p>Menzies concedes that Prince Philip has “real wit” and the ruling family is more interesting than he anticipated, but said he is glad they have little power.</p>

      <p>The actor has also taken issue with the honours system, and said he would think about turning down an OBE if ever offered one.</p>
      <p>He told Radio Times: “I’m still more of a republican, and instinctively I don’t love the idea of hereditary power.</p>
      <p>“But given that there isn’t a lot of power attached to that role, maybe it’s a good idea.”</p>
      <p>Menzies praised Philip for working hard and being energetic in his duties.</p>
      <p>The actor also sympathised with his gaffes, believing it is difficult to walk into a room of people tongue-tied due to the presence of royalty.</p>
      <blockquote>Inherently I don’t massively agree with the honours system. It feels like it entrenches privilege</blockquote>
      <p>He said royal life would be “very boring” and has a problem with institutional privilege.</p>
      <p>Menzies said: “I’d definitely think about not accepting an OBE.</p>
      <p>“Inherently I don’t massively agree with the honours system. It feels like it entrenches privilege.”</p>
      <p>Menzies attended fee-paying schools before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and has gone on to star in Outlander and Game Of Thrones.</p>
      <p>He stars alongside Olivia Colman in the new series of The Crown.</p>
      <p>The full interview with Menzies is available in Radio Times, out now.</p>
