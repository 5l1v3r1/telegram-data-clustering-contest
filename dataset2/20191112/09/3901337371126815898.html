      <p>Prior to the Soweto Derby between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates at the weekend, coach Ernst Middendorp, coach of log leaders Amakhosi, honoured reigning champions Mamelodi Sundowns in their absence.</p>

      <p>During a photo opportunity for the media Middendorp decided against posing with the Absa Premiership trophy at the Killarney Country Club and explained the reason behind his actions moments later to the press.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, I thought leave it and respect in a way that if you have it at the end of the season then you can touch it for the next 12 months. I am not superstitious at all, it is just to show a little bit of respect that this trophy currently belongs to Mamelodi Sundowns and that’s it. It’s just my opinion, if you ask me,” the coach said.</p>
      <p>Chiefs went on to win the Soweto Derby 3-2 on Saturday afternoon, with Amakhosi opening a 10-point gap at the top of the standings, while Sundowns suffered defeat by the same scoreline to Golden Arrows a day later.  </p>
