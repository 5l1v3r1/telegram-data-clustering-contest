      <p>MANILA, Nov 12 — A communist rebel ambush killed six Philippine soldiers and wounded 20 others, the military said today, in one of the deadliest assaults in the nation’s five-decade-old Maoist insurgency. </p>
      <p>Troops patrolling on foot on the eastern island of Samar were hit with homemade bombs and fought a 30-minute gunfight with New People’s Army rebels on Monday.</p>
      <p>“They used IEDs (improvised explosive devices), leading to a large number of casualties,” regional military spokesman Captain Reynaldo Aragones told AFP, adding one rebel was also killed.</p>
      <p>The NPA, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, launched its rebellion to create a Maoist state in 1969. According to the military, the insurgency has claimed 40,000 lives.</p>
      <p>Samar is an impoverished region that is fertile ground for recruitment by the 4,000-member NPA.</p>
      <p>“There are many areas still outside the government’s reach,” Aragones said.</p>
      <p>The NPA killed six soldiers in a similar attack elsewhere on Samar in April, while a military raid uncovered and destroyed NPA bomb-making camp last month, he added.</p>
      <p>President Rodrigo Duterte shelved peace talks with the Maoists in 2017, alleging their leaders were not interested in making peace. — AFP</p>
