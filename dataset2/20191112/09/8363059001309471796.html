      <h1>How to Screen Record on an iPhone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:00:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tegan Jones</a></address>
      <p>I recently discovered that I've been <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/how-to-move-iphone-apps-android">dragging iPhone apps the hard way</a> for my entire adult life. And I certainly wasn't the only one.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate the easier way to do it, I took a screen recording of my phone. As it turns out, not everyone knows how to do this.</p>
      <p>So here's an explainer.</p>
      <h3>How to set it up</h3>
      <p>Before you go on a screen recording frenzy, you'll want to set it up for ease of use later.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open 'Settings'</li>
        <li>Go to 'Control Center' and then 'Customise Controls'</li>
        <li>Tap the green '+' symbol next to 'Screen Recording'</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These instructions will also work for iPad and iPod Touch.</p>

      <h3>How to use it</h3>
      <p>For iOS 12 and later you'll see the round recording icon when you swipe down from the top right corner of your screen.</p>
      <p>If you're on iOS 11 or earlier, you'll need to swipe up from the bottom edge of your screen to find the record icon.</p>
      <p>Tap the icon to trigger a 3 second countdown. Your screen will then start recording. Tap the red icon in the top left corner when you want to stop recording.</p>
      <p>The footage will save in the photos app.</p>
      <p>It's as simply as that! Happy recording.</p>
