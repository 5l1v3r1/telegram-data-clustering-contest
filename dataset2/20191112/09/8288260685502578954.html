      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | The AVFC record signing was a surprise call-up to the Brazilian international side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:13:10+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea star Willian has revealed he has been following Wesley's early Premier League performances ahead of his maiden Brazil call up.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> striker was a surprise name in Brazil's latest squad for the friendly fixtures against Argentina and North Korea.</p>
      <p>Since arriving on B6 for a club-record £22m fee, Wesley has netted four times in 12 top flight performances, but still has his fair share of claret and blue doubters.</p>

      <p>A number of fans continue to call for Dean Smith to look at other options to lead the line, including splashing the cash in the January window.</p>
      <p>But Willian, who will join up with Wesley this week feels he has adapted well to English football.</p>
      <p>“He’s doing great, I’ve been following his games a little,” Willian told Globo Esporte.</p>

      <p>“He is a player who is very well adapted, looks like he’s been in England for a while, scoring goals. I hope he can be happy in the Brazilian team too.”</p>
      <p>The decision has gone down controversially in his homeland, as the former Club Brugge striker has never played for a top flight club in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Wesley posted an emotional message, after the news emerged: “I am living a very special moment and I have no words to describe my happiness.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I always dreamed of representing Brazil and I will have the possibility of realising this dream.</p>
      <p>“I have had a hard time getting here and I will never forget the people who have helped me since the beginning of my career.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I thank all those who have always believed in my football and the clubs that have trusted me. I can only thank my family, who are by my side in good times and bad times, and my managers.</p>
      <p>“I always kept my feet on the ground and now it will be no different. I will do my best to prove that I can contribute to the National Team.”</p>
