      <h1>Google Chrome Will Soon Shame Slow Websites and Reward Optimized Ones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:28:49+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:28</time> by <a rel="author">George Kamau</a></address>
      <p>Google has just announced that its browser app, <a href="https://techweez.com/?s=Chrome">Chrome</a> will soon start to identify and label slow websites while rewarding optimized websites. When browsing using the app, Chrome will notify users when a site may load slowly. This announcement was made during the Chrome Developer Summit ad the company will use a badging system.</p>
      <h3>How the badging system will work</h3>
      <p>The badging system Chrome plans to use will look at historical load latencies of websites to determine if they’re authored in a way that makes them load slow. This feature will be expanded in the future to include identifying when a page is likely to load slowly because of your internet connection or device.</p>
      <p>When users click on a website that Chrome has identified as slow, users will be shown a message saying “Usually loads slow” on the loading screen. The site will also have a blue progress indicator.</p>
      <p>When users visit an optimized site that loads faster, they’ll see a green progress indicator.</p>

      <p>“Speed has been one of Chrome’s core principles since the beginning – we’re constantly working to give users an experience that is instant as they browse the web. That said, we have all visited web pages we thought would load fast, only to be met by an experience that could have been better. We think the web can do better and want to help users understand when a site may load slowly, while rewarding sites delivering fast experiences,” read the statement posted on the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html">Chromium blog</a>.</p>
      <p>The exact dates of when the new badging system will go live were not revealed.</p>
      <p>Attendees also resolved the spirited tabs vs spaces fight.</p>
