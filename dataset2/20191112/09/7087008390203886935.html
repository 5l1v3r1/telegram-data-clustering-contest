      <h1>Central Banks Must See Libra As Improvement To Their Cryptocurrencies, Libra’s Co-Creator Says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:40:24+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Lyanchev</a></address>
      <p>Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, Libra, could be used to build on top of central bank digital currencies. That’s what the venture’s co-creator and head economist reiterated today at a FinTech conference in Singapore. Interestingly enough, the statement also comes at times when a few countries are contemplating the launch of their own state-backed digital currencies.</p>
      <h3>Libra Improving State-Backed Digital Currencies</h3>
      <p>Christian Catalini, Libra’s co-creator and head economist of Calibra, <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/banking-finance/facebooks-libra-can-coexist-with-central-banks-digital-currencies-says-its-co">spoke</a> in Singapore at a FinTech Festival today about Facebook’s projected cryptocurrency. According to him, Libra could not only co-exist with the upcoming central bank digital currencies (CBDC), but it could build on top of them:</p>
      <blockquote>“From the start, it was clear to us that eventually, central banks will be issuing some flavors of central bank digital currency, and we wanted the system to be future-proofed for that. In fact, Libra would have built on those central bank digital currencies.”</blockquote>
      <p>During his speech, Catalini also addressed the concerns behind Libra’s backing. He said that the cryptocurrency’s reserve represents a complement to monetary policy and that the assets behind it are managed, controlled, and generated by central banks.</p>

      <h3>Libra’s Impact On CBDCs</h3>
      <p>Libra was first officially introduced back in June and it took the world by a storm. <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/libra-vs-bitcoin-what-is-facebooks-libra-coin-why-is-it-different-from-bitcoin/">The project</a> also attracted serious regulatory attention with legislators across the world battling to take a stance on the matter.</p>
      <p>It’s also interesting that a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/rivaling-facebooks-libra-eu-draft-suggests-creation-of-a-new-coin/">draft document</a> of the European Union implies the creation of a new coin that would compete with Libra. In other words, state-backed cryptocurrencies are starting to get more traction.</p>
      <p>Another example comes from China. Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/china-to-reportedly-launch-government-backed-cryptocurrency-in-novembe/">announced</a> that the central bank will launch a government-backed cryptocurrency to be distributed to certain major institutions and corporations in the country. Additionally, the vice-chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chinas-cciee-chair-we-will-be-the-first-to-launch-central-bank-digital-currency/">said</a> that their product will be a first market mover.</p>
      <p>Just today, Mu Changchun, head of the People’s Bank of China’s digital currency research institute, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-digital-currency/chinas-digital-currency-not-seeking-full-control-of-individuals-details-central-bank-official-idUSKBN1XM0H2">reassured</a> the public that they will be creating a balanced currency:</p>
      <blockquote>“We know the demand from the general public Is to keep anonymity by using paper money and coins […] we will give those people who demand it anonymity in their transactions. But at the same time, we will keep the balance between the “controllable” anonymity and anti-money laundering, Counter-terrorist financing, and also tax issues, online gambling, and any electronic criminal activities.</blockquote>
      <p>In any case, it does appear that Catalini’s comments are properly timed and they do seem to follow the trends in the field.</p>
