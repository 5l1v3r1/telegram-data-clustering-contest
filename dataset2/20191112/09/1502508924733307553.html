      <p>IL&amp;FS Group on Tuesday said it has received approval from creditors for sale of education business to<br/><br/>Career Point Publications Pvt Ltd (CPPPL).</p>
      <p>Schoolnet India Ltd (erstwhile IL&amp;FS Education &amp; Technology Service Ltd) would be sold to CPPPL.</p>
      <p>The Committee of Creditors (CoC) represents all the financial creditors to IL&amp;FS Ltd, the holding company of the IL&amp;FS Group.</p>
      <p>According to a release, CPPPL's financial bid was approved by more than 78 per cent of IL&amp;FS's creditors, in terms of value, through an e-voting process that concluded on November 5.</p>
      <p>Sources said the outstanding debt for this business amounts to Rs 600-650 crore.</p>
      <p>The transaction marks the latest step towards overall resolution of debt totalling around Rs 94,000 crore.</p>
      <p>IL&amp;FS Group holds 73.70 per cent stake in Schoolnet India Ltd (SIL). The latter has 80 per cent stake in IL&amp;FS Skill Development Corporation (ISDC) and also has two subsidiaries -- IL&amp;FS Cluster Development Initiative (ICDI) and Skill Training Assessment Management Partners (STAMP).</p>
      <p>The sale was approved by IL&amp;FS board on November 7.</p>
      <p>Under the resolution framework for IL&amp;FS, approval of Justice (Retd) D K Jain would be sought for the deal before approaching the National Company Law Tribunal for clearance.</p>
      <p>The release said CPPPL made a binding offer, at an implied enterprise value, whereby it shall assume responsibility for all the debt of SIL and ISDC in addition to paying a certain amount towards purchase of SIL's equity.</p>
      <p>"As part of this transaction, CPPPL will also get ownership of 80 per cent stake in ISDC held by SIL," it added.</p>
      <p>Further, CPPPL has also made a binding offer to purchase the businesses, including certain business debt of the two subsidiaries of SIL -- ICDI and STAMP for an additional consideration.</p>
