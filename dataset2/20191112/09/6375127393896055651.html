      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa responded to Vice President Leni Robredo’s call for police to wear Body-Worn Cameras or BWCs in their anti-narcotics operations saying that the Duterte government in 2018 has allotted P334 million for the same purpose.</h3>
      <p>“We warmly welcome Vice President Leni Robredo as co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs. Under her leadership, the PNP looks forward to intensified anti-illegal drugs operations and rehabilitation of drug users and upholding the rule of law,” said Gamboa.</p>
      <p>He added  that they will make Mrs. Robredo as “comfortable as possible” as she starts in her new job.</p>
      <p>The official explained that he is against the Vice President joining actual anti-drug operations simply because of the risk it poses to officials like her.  </p>
      <p>Gamboa said  PNP generals like him don’t join actual police raids and the same could be considered by Mrs. Robredo.</p>
      <p>However, he said  amid the Vice President’s suggestion to require police to wear body cameras during the conduct of anti-drug operations,  the idea is really not new since in 2018, the PNP proposed for the procurement of these BWCs.</p>
      <p>“In response to the need, the government has allotted P334 million for this purpose. At present, a total of six suppliers are undergoing post-qualification to meet all the requirements. The procurement will include accessories, video management software, computer servers, storage and connectivity systems for the body-worn cameras.</p>
      <p>“The PNP will not only procure body cameras but a sophisticated, reliable and secure system which will allow complete system management, real-time live streaming, data storage and backup, and overall connectivity and monitoring,” Gamboa  said.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said as planned, a Central Data Center --  National Management and Monitoring Center, 17 Regional Monitoring Centers and 81 Provincial Monitoring Centers -- will also be established to fully support the systems of body cameras.</p>
      <p>“The CDG shall be located at the PNP Information Technology Management Service; the NMMC shall be located at the PNP National Operation Center; 17 Regional Monitoring Centers  shall be located at the Police Provincial Offices nationwide,” he added.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC said  apart from the WBCs, they are also programming the procurement of more protective gears to support their anti-narcotics agents.</p>
      <p>Gamboa reiterated that the PNP has not launched killings as a part of their anti-illegal drug operations.</p>
      <p>He said the over 5,000 recorded deaths since the police launched its war on drugs at the start of the Duterte administration, officials have maintained that the suspects were killed in gunbattles with officers having no recourse but to return fire when the armed drug dealers started shooting at them.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC said that BWC would really be a tool for transparency and that there would be official protocols on when and how to use them.</p>
      <p>“We also have to balance it with the Data Prevention Act. In the PNP, it will be for departmental use only, maybe part of our transparency program,” he said.</p>
      <p>Gamboa  clarified that the BWCs they are procuring will not only be used in the conduct of anti-drug operations but also for all other law enforcement operations like conduct of checkpoints and combat operations.</p>
