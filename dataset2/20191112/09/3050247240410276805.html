      <h1>Bitcoin Price ‘Ranging’ Continues as Trader Says $8,400 Could Be Next</h1>

      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) was struggling to recapture $8,800 on Nov. 12 after selling pressure sent the largest <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> broadly lower late on Monday.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin fails to gain momentum to break $9K</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD trading between $8,700 and $8,800 on Tuesday morning, having fallen to local lows of $8,630 in the past 24 hours. </p>
      <p>Despite volatility waning in recent days, Bitcoin remained broadly lower as the week began, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-returns-to-87k-as-resistance-becomes-new-bull-support">losing support at $9,000</a>.</p>

      <p>Having exited its previous trading range, Bitcoin was now laying the foundations for further downside, analysts said. </p>
      <p>In his most recent <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1193963882370543618">Twitter update</a>, regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> eyed the potential for BTC/USD to fall to around $8,400. </p>
      <p>“Could continue the ranging here. For bulls; break back above $9,050 required,” he summarized.</p>
      <p>Van de Poppe added that current price behavior signified a tussle between bull and bear forces over Bitcoin, something which nonetheless was not repeating on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">altcoin</a> markets.</p>
      <p>Despite the current slide, Bitcoin remains higher than many models forecast for this year. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rallies-hardest-in-november-so-why-are-the-charts-bearish">reported</a>, the most accurate models call for an average BTC/USD price of $8,300 until next May’s block reward halving event. </p>
      <h3>Altcoins diverge from sluggish BTC</h3>
      <p>Altcoins indeed showed mixed behavior over the past 24 hours. While Bitcoin stayed mostly static, shifts of up to 5% characterized the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, nonetheless copied Bitcoin’s behavior, shedding just 0.25% to remain at $186.</p>

      <p>The leader was NEO (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/neo">NEO</a>), however, which rose almost 6% and extended a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tron-price-up-25-as-china-reportedly-bans-anti-blockchain-sentiment">Chinese token run</a> which began in late October. </p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $240.3 billion at press time, with Bitcoin’s share making up 66% of the total.</p>
