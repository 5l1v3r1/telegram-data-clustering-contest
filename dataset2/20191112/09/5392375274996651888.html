      <p>According to reports, this chip uses the 7nm process technology. In addition, it is the world’s first smartphone chip that uses ARM’s latest and fastest Cortex A77 CPU and Mali-G77 GPU. More importantly, it integrates the Helio M70 5G modem with 4.7Gbps download speed and 2.5 Gbps upload speed. It further supports 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G connectivity as well as a dynamic power allocation.</p>
      <p>This product is suitable for 5G independent and non-independent (SA/NSA) networking architecture. It also supports the sub-6GHz frequency band as well as 60fps 4K video encoding/decoding, and up to 80MP camera.</p>
      <p>This MediaTek 5G mobile platform is energy-efficient, and the design can achieve higher transmission speeds with lower power consumption. It creates a comprehensive ultra-high-speed 5G solution for terminal handset manufacturers. In addition, it uses a new AI architecture, equipped with a new independent AI processing unit APU which supports more advanced AI applications. The chip also supports image processing technology that eliminates image blur. Thus even when the object is highly unstable, the user can still take a wonderful photo.</p>
