      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Indonesia’s Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Wishnutama Kusubandio said that news of him suggesting to make Bali more Muslim-friendly was a misreporting.

      <hr/>
      <p>Bali Governor I Wayan Koster has now weighed in on supposed plans to transform the island into a Muslim-friendly destination, stressing instead that Bali has always been open to everyone and therefore requires no such labels. </p>
      <p>“All this while, tourism in Bali has never looked at [tourists’] religion or origins. Everyone who comes here are treated well, and so far there has been no problem. So don’t go around disturbing the tourism concept here in Bali,” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kanalbali/guburnur-bali-soal-wisata-ramah-muslim-1sEPrPtwXSX">Koster said yesterday, as quoted by <i>Kumparan</i>.</a></p>
      <p>In case you aren’t all caught up, Indonesia’s Tourism and Creative Economy Minister, Wishnutama Kusubandio, last week suggested that top destinations in the country, such as Bali, will <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/indonesias-tourism-minister-plans-to-make-bali-more-muslim-friendly/">undergo some changes to accommodate more Muslim tourists.</a></p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://bali.idntimes.com/news/bali/ayu-afria-ulita-ermalia/gubernur-bali-wayan-koster-singgung-ramah-wisman-muslim-wishnutama-1">Koster said he had communicated via WhatsApp with the minister</a>, who claimed that the media outlet who reported on his plans to transform Bali had made a mistake, according to a report from <i>IDN Times. </i></p>
      <p>“I haven’t communicated [in person], but I think the Minister must seriously learn the tourism policy that we’ve implemented all this time. It’s not necessary to make counterproductive statements,” Koster said. </p>
      <p>“If Bali were to be attached with taglines, such as halal tourism or Muslim-friendly tourism, then I will firmly reject it. It must not be so. Let Bali grow on its own, according to its culture.” </p>
