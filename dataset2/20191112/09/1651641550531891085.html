      <p>At the Galaxy Note 10 launch event, we saw Microsoft-Samsung partnership reaching new heights. Of all the announcements, the most interesting was the ‘Link to Windows,’ which was first launched as a Note 10 exclusive feature. Samsung later <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsofts-link-to-windows-for-galaxy-note10-series-to-come-to-more-samsung-galaxy-smartphones/">announced</a> that it will bring the feature to more Galaxy smartphones.</p>
      <p>True to its word, In a new software update, Samsung has launched the ‘Link to Windows’ feature for Galaxy A70s smartphones.</p>
      <p>For those unaware, the ‘Link to Windows’ does pretty much similar things to what you can do with Your Phone Companion app. With the ‘Link to Windows’ feature, you’ll be able to access your recent photos, text messages, notifications, and mobile apps right on your PC. Microsoft also promised that it will add the ability to make and receive mobile calls directly from your PC to the feature list.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the software update also brings other new features such as support for the Bixby side key function, Type C Headsets. Apart from that, the software update includes bug fixes and device stability improvements, and October 2019 security patches.</p>
      <p>‘Link to Windows’ works smoothly on other Samsung devices too, but to enjoy the feature on unsupported Galaxy devices, you’ll need to go follow a few steps. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10s-link-to-windows-feature-works-on-other-samsung-devices-too-and-here-is-how-to-enable-it/">This link will walk you through the entire process</a>.</p>
