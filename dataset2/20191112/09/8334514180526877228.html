      <p>BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia’s regional parliament approved on Tuesday a non-binding motion expressing the will to exercise self-determination, defying a warning from Spain’s Constitutional Court.</p>
      <p>The motion calls for political action but has no legal effect, a parliament spokeswoman told Reuters. Catalan pro-independence parties hold a majority in the chamber.</p>
      <p>The Spanish court has warned that Catalan lawmakers would face legal consequences if they pushed forward with the motion, which said the parliament expressed the “will to exercise in a concrete way the right of self-determination and to respect the will of the Catalan people.”</p>
