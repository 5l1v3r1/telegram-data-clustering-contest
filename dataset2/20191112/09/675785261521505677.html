      <p>Hundreds of fans turned out to give Great Britain a superstar welcome to Papua New Guinea today.</p>
      <p>Rugby league is the national sport on the island - the only country in the world where league dominates.</p>
      <p>Supporters flocked to the Jackson International Airport in Port Moresby to see them arrive and then mobbed the players as they came out.</p>
      <p>Centre Jake Connor said: "It was a bit crazy, it was a bit mind blowing. I have never seen anything like it before.</p>
      <p>"It was like something off a film. Everyone wanted to touch you and wanted to take some of your training kit. It opens your eyes to what it is like over here."</p>

      <p>Great Britain have lost all three games on their tour Down Under, to Tonga and twice to New Zealand.</p>
      <p>But Connor said they are determined to feed off the league frenzy in PNG and respond with a win against the Kumuls on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are going to experience some different things and hopefully put a smile on our faces and forget about the losses that have happened and refresh our minds.</p>

      <p>"The first defeat to New Zealand was not nice but we really thought we were going to come away with a win in the second game.</p>
      <p>"It was quite tough. We fell short again but we know what we are capable of and I am sure we will bounce back."</p>
      <p>Half backs George Williams and Jake Trueman will both make their Lions debuts in Saturday's game.</p>
