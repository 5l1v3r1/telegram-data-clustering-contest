      <h1>Dad's touching photo of steamed-up shower shows 'crazy' reality of being a mum</h1>
      <h2>The father's photo of his wife's dedication to their daughter has struck a chord with other parents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:55:27+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>A dad who shared a simple photo of a steamed-up shower door has used the powerful image to illustrate the little-sacrifices his wife makes every day as a mum.</p>
      <p>After coming home from work, Zack Williams noticed his baby daughter Lottie's basket was in the bathroom.</p>
      <p>His wife Heather explained she had put it in there while she got cleaned up during the day and the couple went on to talk about how much their little one had grown.</p>
      <p>The next morning as Zack turned on the shower, he spotted a tiny detail which made him 'so appreciative' of his wife - and it's really struck a chord with other parents.</p>

      <p>The dad, from the United States, turned on the shower and as the steam filled the room, he noticed an area where Heather had wiped the glass so she could keep an eye on their daughter and make faces to keep her entertained.</p>
      <p>"I literally just sat there and stared at the glass and smiled," he wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>"I could see it, I imagined it, it was like I was there in the room with them.</p>
      <p>"I could see Heather just looking through the glass and making faces at Lottie as she smiled and played in her bassinet. I just melted!</p>
      <p>"It’s so crazy to me, how the smallest things can make me so appreciative of my wife. It’s the little sacrifices my wife makes for this family, that would normally go unnoticed."</p>
      <p>He continued: "Mannnnn... I can’t tell you how much this fogged up glass means to me!</p>
      <p>"The fact that my wife can’t even shower without caring for someone else, tending to someone else’s needs. She doesn’t get a second to herself to relax.</p>

      <p>"My wife doesn’t get to clock out, my wife doesn’t get the satisfaction of seeing a cheque deposited in the bank in return for her hard work, my wife doesn’t get to eat lunch with coworkers, my wife doesn’t get to just walk outside and just take a deep breath.</p>
      <p>"This may be just a fogged-up piece of glass to some, but to me it means so much more.</p>
      <p>"It’s the little things like this that don’t go unnoticed. It’s the little things like this that constantly remind me how badass she is. It’s the little things like this that make me fall in love with her all over again."</p>
      <p>The touching post was shared to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HisViewFromHome/posts/2391820904468987">His View From Home</a> , a Facebook page sharing real stories about fatherhood, where it's since been shared 28,000 times and attracted 6,200 comments.</p>
      <p>Other related heavily to the post and shared their own experiences of the sacrifices their partners make as parents.</p>
      <p>One mum said: "I'm a retired nurse. When my kids were little on Saturdays he would wake the boys and take them to breakfast so I could sleep in. So Sweet.</p>
      <p>Another said: "If anyone ever wrote something so beautiful for me my heart would stop."</p>
