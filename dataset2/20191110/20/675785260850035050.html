      <h2>Staff at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Canberra finally worked out why so many poppies were missing when they spotted the bird's new home near a stained glass window at The Australian War Memorial</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:39:13+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Pippa Allen-Kinross</a></address>
      <p>The mysterious disappearance of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/poppies">poppies</a> from The Australian War Memorial has been solved after a pigeon was found to have built a rather patriotic nest on Remembrance Day.</p>
      <p>Staff had been concerned when they noticed that poppies were going missing from the Tomb of the Unknown <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/soldiers">Soldier</a> in Canberra, until a maintenance worker spotted the nest in the Hall of Memory a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Photographs show the pigeon proudly sat on its nest by the stained glass window of a wounded Australian solider in the mosaic-covered hall.</p>
      <p>A war memorial spokesperson told <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6479925/pigeon-steals-poppies-to-make-its-home-at-the-australian-war-memorial/?cs=14225">The Canberra Times</a> that the nest would be cleared once the pigeon has finished with it.</p>

      <p>They added that the wounded soldier symbolised the quality of "endurance", and the nest of poppies was a "reminder of the powerful bond between man and beast on the battlefield."</p>
      <p>Pigeons have been used regularly in warfare, including the First and Second World Wars, as a way of sending messages.</p>
      <p>Historian Dr Meleah Hampton said: "Pigeons are particularly of use in warfare when you've got a couple of men trying to get a message from where they are back to the backline.</p>
      <p>"A pigeon can get that through sometimes when nothing else can."</p>

      <p>According to the Royal Pigeon Racing Association, in Britain alone nearly a quarter of a million pigeons were used by the Army, the Royal Air Force and civil defences services including the police and fire service during World War Two.</p>
      <p>The Dickin Medal was inaugurated in 1943 to honour the work of animals in war.</p>
      <p>According to Historic UK, 32 messenger pigeons have received the award, as well as 34 dogs, four horses and a cat.</p>
