        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Acting Afghan Interior Minister Masoud Andarabi announced on Sunday that the Daesh terrorist group* had been defeated in the country, while remaining small cells would be eliminated, media reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The minister declared the victory over the terror group in eastern Nangarhar province, where he was introducing a new police chief, according to Afghanistanâ€™s 1TV channel.</p>
      <p>Nangarhar is considered to be a key province since it was where Daesh* <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911071077243858-daesh-branches-in-afghanistan-plan-expansion-to-cis-territory---russian-security-service/">first emerged</a> in the country in 2014 and established its stronghold.</p>
      <p>Andarabi noted that some Daesh cells still remained in the country, shifting to other provinces, and pledged to destroy them.</p>
      <p>Daesh announced the creation of its branch in Afghanistan in January 2015, having launched a number of deadly attacks on civilians and soldiers.</p>
