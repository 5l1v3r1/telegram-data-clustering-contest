      <h2>Malcolm lands a move to League One despite nightmare season with East Kilbride</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:10:39+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Stuart Malcolm has left East Kilbride to become the new manager of League One Forfar Athletic.</p>
      <p>The former Loons defender has presided over Kilby's worst-ever start to a Lowland League season, taking them to 8th in the table in defence of their title and 16 points adrift of leaders Kelty Hearts.</p>
      <p>But, in a surprise move, Malcolm has secured a big switch to Scotland's third tier.</p>
      <p>He told the News: "I was interviewed for the role this afternoon, so it's been a bit of a whirlwind. I was only appointed an hour ago."</p>
      <p>Malcolm is set to confirm his backroom team shortly and will take his first training session with the Station Park side tomorrow.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Malcolm denied he'd applied for the post to replace Jim Weir, who resigned from the post last week.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the 40-year-old guided East Kilbride to the fourth round of the South Challenge Cup with a 1-0 win over 10-man East Stirlingshire at K-Park in his last act as manager.</p>

      <p>Last season Malcolm guided EK to the league title, but suffered a heavy 5-1 aggregate defeat to Cove Rangers in the SPFL play-offs.</p>
      <p>Since then, EK have plummeted down the table and have lost four out of six home games in the league this season.</p>
      <p>Malcolm had come under fire from fans for recent results, but the Kilby board resisted calls for him to be relived of his duties.</p>
      <p>He now takes charge of a side who have lost their last six games on the spin and sit bottom of League One.</p>
