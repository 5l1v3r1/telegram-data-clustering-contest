      <p>Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is only in his second season in the league, but he continues to look more and more like Falcons legend Michael Vick with each passing week.</p>
      <p>It’s been said that Vick is Jackson’s ceiling, although many believed he wouldn’t play anywhere near that level. ESPN analyst Bill Polian even advocated for Jackson to declare himself as a wide receiver, not a quarterback, heading into the NFL Draft. It’s clear he was very wrong, though.</p>
      <p>Jackson made the highlight reel once again on Sunday, when he used an insane spin move to juke a few Bengals defenders out of their cleats.</p>
