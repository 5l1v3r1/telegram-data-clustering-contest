      <p>The Reds brought back their regulars from their UEFA Champions League win over Genk, with Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah flanking Roberto Firmino in attack. Meanwhile, Man City had a suspect defensive line that included deputy goalkeeper Claudio Bravo Ederson and Fernandinho playing makeshift centre-back alongside John Stones.</p>
      <p>The game got off to a flying and controversial start after Fabinho opened the scoring for Liverpool in the sixth minute with a wonder strike from outside the box, just moments after the Citizens players were appealing for a penalty after a ball glanced off Trent Alexander-Arnold's arm inside the box but the Video Assistant Referee was not convinced.</p>
      <p>Salah gave Jurgen Klopp's troops a 2-0 lead in the 13th minute after pouncing on a diagonal cross from Andrew Robertson to nod past a helpless Bravo.</p>
      <p>The Reds almost made bagged a third goal with eight minutes remaining of the first stanza after Firmino let fly with a threatening strike from outside the box , but Bravo was on hand to deny the Brazilian.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Reds had a great start in the second stanza after Sadio Mane extended the lead six minutes after the break with a free header at the back post from Jordan Henderson's cross.</p>
      <p>Guardiola responded with his first change with 20 minutes remaining, after bringing on Gabriel Jesus in place of Sergio Aguero in the hope of a change of fortunes upfront.</p>
      <p>City did manage to pull a goal back with 12 minutes remaining after Bernardo Silva rifled one into the bottom corner after being getting on the end of Angelino's cross.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's charges had another penalty appeal in the last eight minutes after Raheem Sterling's shot hit Alexander-Arnold's hand for the second time in the match but the referee again was not persuaded as the encounter finished 3-1 in favour to the hosts.</p>
