      <h1>Man dies after screams for help from castle tower during Remembrance Day service</h1>
      <h2>Emergency services dashed to Caernarfon Castle in north Wales on Remembrance Day but were unable to save him - with guests were evacuated from the landmark</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:54:05+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Bagnall, Sarah Hodgson</a></address>
      <p>A man has died at a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance Sunday</a> service.</p>
      <p>Visitors at Caernarfon Castle in north Wales heard the man screaming for help just before midday.</p>
      <p>Guests were evacuated from the landmark, moments after the traditional two minute's silence was observed.</p>
      <p>Paramedics from the air ambulance rushed to help the stricken man but were unable to save him.</p>
      <p>A witness told <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/man-dies-caernarfon-castle-remembrance-17232260">North Wales Live</a> how a member of the emergency services went into nearby shops and asked staff to pull down the blinds as the body was removed from the castle.</p>
      <p>"It is very sad to hear," Eleri Gray-Thomas who runs the caf√© opposite said.</p>
      <p>It is not known who the man was but it is believed he was from overseas.</p>

      <p>All entrances to the castle were blocked off with a cordon put in place from the town square to the castle ditch.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service confirmed they were called to a medical emergency at Caernarfon Castle.</p>
      <p>Ambulance staff who had been stationed nearby were first on the scene with police and two more ambulances following.</p>
      <p>It is thought <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-british-legion">Royal British Legion</a> had held the service at the attraction.</p>
      <p>Caernarfon Castle and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/north-wales-police">North Wales Police</a> have provided no further details.</p>
