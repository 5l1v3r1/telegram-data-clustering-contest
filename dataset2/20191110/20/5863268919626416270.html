        <b>President, PM extend felicitations to Muslims</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Imran Khan have extended their felicitations to Muslims on the occasion of Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).</p>
      <p>In separate messages, they said the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) established a welfare state and a role model society by better management.</p>
      <p>The president, in his message, said the government has been striving to develop Pakistan as a welfare state based on the principles of the State of Madina.</p>
      <p>He said the government has been making economic and social reforms in various sectors which can bring positive outcomes very soon.</p>
      <p>The president urged the citizens particularly the religious scholars to play their role to make Pakistan a welfare state.</p>
      <p>The PM said the thought of welfare state was, first ever, introduced by Islam in the human history. He said the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) and Khulafa-e-Rashideen practically materialised this thought in the first Hijri Century.</p>
      <p>He said the birth of Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) marked the end of a history of inhumanity, oppression, tyranny, ignorance, injustice and deviation from the right path and purified civilisation by inculcating characteristics like human dignity and forgiveness.</p>
