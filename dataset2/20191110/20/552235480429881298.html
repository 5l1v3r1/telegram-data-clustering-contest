      <h2>The Celtic boss has revealed the striker still has some hurdles to overcome before being selected.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:39:26+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon has explained <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leigh-griffiths">Leigh Griffiths</a> ' continued absence from the Celtic squad as the striker was not involved in the 2-0 victory over Motherwell.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> forward hasn’t played for the champions since a 3-1 victory over Hearts in late August. Following his personal problems the former Hibs star has been hit with niggling injuries and a virus.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was pictured at Celtic Park as he took part in a full training session before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> jetted out to Rome.</p>
      <p>But he was not involved in the heroic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> result or the visit of the Steelmen.</p>

      <p>And Lennon has provided an update on Griffiths' fitness and issued a challenge to his talisman to get up to speed in the next fortnight.</p>
      <p>He told Celtic TV: “We’re hoping to give him two good weeks of work, then he has a developmental game next week – see how he comes through that.</p>
      <p>“We want him up to speed, he’s not up to speed, not at the level that we want him at, he’s got to do the work in the next two weeks."</p>
