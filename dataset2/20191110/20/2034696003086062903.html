      <p>The ad shows a defeated mother driving her kids around with ‘Nookie’ playing on repeat because the song is stuck in the car’s CD player. A voiceover says: “You’d do anything to get rid of this car, but who’d buy it…with a CD player that’s stuck playing Limp Bizkit?”</p>
      <p>As the mother looks up at an intersection, Fred Durst makes a cameo crossing the street with a bag of groceries looking baffled. “Just sell it to CarMax. We’ll buy any car, even this one,” the narration continues, driving the point home that CarMax, the largest used-car retailer in the United States, will buy any car, even one with a Limp Bizkit CD stuck in it.</p>
