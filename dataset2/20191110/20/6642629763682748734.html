      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/romania.html">Romania</a>'s incumbent President Klaus Iohannis won the first round of a presidential election on Sunday, and is likely to face opposition Social Democrat leader and former prime minister Viorica Dancila in a November 24 runoff, exit polls showed.</p>
      <p>An exit poll conducted by IRES pollster showed Iohannis garnered 38.7 percent of votes followed by Dancila with 22 percent. Save Romania Union head Dan Barna got 16.1 percent.</p>
      <p>Another poll by Curs-Avangarde ranked Iohannis first with 39 percent and Dancila with 22.5 percent.</p>
      <p>"The official results will come tomorrow but exit poll data show that millions of Romanians from the country and from abroad voted for our project, for a normal Romania and for us to continue the important process of changing Romania for the better," Iohannis told supporters.</p>
      <p>Data by the electoral bureau, which is expected to unveil partial official results from Monday morning, showed a turnout of 48 percent with a record high diaspora voter presence of 660,000 - which was not taken into account by the exit polls.</p>
      <p>If no contender wins more than 50 percent, there will be a second round of voting.</p>

      <p>Voters in Romania headed to the polls earlier on Sunday to pick their next president after a lacklustre election campaign overshadowed by a political crisis which saw a minority government installed just a few days ago.</p>
      <p>Around 18.2 million voters were eligible to vote for one of 14 candidates vying for the five-year presidency.</p>
      <p>Dancila's Social Democrat government was forced to step down after losing a no-confidence vote in Parliament, amid corruption scandals and allegations it wanted close control of the judiciary.</p>
      <p>Iohannis is a former leader of the National Liberal Party, which on Monday formed a minority government led by Prime Minister Ludovic Orban.</p>
      <h3>Polarisation </h3>
      <p>Political analyst Andrei Taranu said polarisation over the political crisis has benefitted the two top candidates.</p>
      <p>"This situation kept Klaus Iohannis and Viorica Dancila in the spotlight, while other candidates had no chance to rise on the political stage," he told news agency Associated Press.</p>
      <p>While lacking an executive role, Romania's president has significant decision-making powers, including on matters of national security and foreign policy, and can reject party nominees for the prime minister and government nominees for judicial appointments.</p>
      <p>The president can also return legislation approved by Parliament but has to ratify it if legislators back it a second time.</p>
      <p>Polling stations across the country opened at 05:00 GMT and will close at 19:00 GMT. </p>
      <p>Voting opened at many locations abroad on Friday and by midday on Saturday more than 200,000 diaspora Romanians had already voted, a record for the first round of a presidential election.</p>
