      <p>Heeeeere's a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484375/midway-box-office-the-world-war-ii-movie-performs-a-surprise-upset-and-beats-doctor-sleep">disappointing opening weekend</a>! <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2474954/doctor-sleep"><i>Doctor Sleep</i></a> was redrum-ed at the box office by a surprise surge from <i>Midway</i> -- which maybe <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484354/why-did-everyone-sleep-on-midway-war-film-set-for-surprise-veterans-day-box-office-win">shouldn't have been a surprise</a> since it's Veterans Day weekend, but anyway.</p>
      <p>The point being, <i>The Shining</i> sequel did not make anywhere near as much money as expected. But rather than focusing on the numbers, <i>The Shining</i> and <i>Doctor Sleep</i> author Stephen King would rather fans discuss the "terrific" film itself.</p>
      <p>Stephen King <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1193005397864599552">replied</a> to a comment from author Matt Serafini, who argued fans shouldn't spend the weekend moping over <i>Doctor Sleep</i>'s box office:</p>

      <p>All box office talk and no play makes Steve a dull boy! It's good to see Stephen King's support for <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, one of the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479397/11-stephen-king-adaptations-worth-streaming-on-netflix-hulu-amazon">many King adaptations</a> this year and coming soon. He could've easily disavowed the new movie, since it's not only based on his own sequel to <i>The Shining</i> but also Stanley Kubrick's film <i>The Shining</i>, which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483769/stephen-kings-hatred-for-stanley-kubricks-the-shining-explained">King infamously disliked</a>. Instead, King called the <i>Doctor Sleep</i> adaptation "terrific" and previously called it "wonderful" in a <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1192459305326432256">tweet</a> suggesting people see the movie.</p>
      <p><i>Doctor Sleep</i> has had some <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483208/doctor-sleep-has-screened-see-what-people-are-saying">very positive reviews</a>, and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483251/heres-how-stephen-king-feels-about-the-early-doctor-sleep-reviews">Stephen King was "delighted"</a> for writer/director Mike Flanagan. King even said he read Flanagan's <i>Doctor Sleep</i> script very carefully, and decided everything he disliked about the Stanley Kubrick film <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483961/stephen-king-thinks-doctor-sleep-redeems-his-dislike-of-the-shining">was redeemed in the new movie</a>. That's high praise! No wonder Flanagan -- who previously <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1708519/geralds-game-review">adapted <i>Gerald's Game</i></a> -- is now talking to King <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483926/doctor-sleeps-mike-flanagan-is-actively-talking-with-stephen-king-about-another-adaptation">about another book adaptation</a>.</p>
      <p>Not everyone was OK with the <i>Doctor Sleep</i> movie's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484338/doctor-sleep-how-different-was-the-movie-from-stephen-kings-book">changes from Stephen King's novel</a>, among other things. However, <i>Doctor Sleep</i> got a B+ CinemaScore from moviegoers polled on opening night, and it has a 90% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes from 2,386 users, which is even higher than the critics' score. <i>Doctor Sleep</i> also has a 7.7/10 rating from more than 14,000 IMDb users.</p>
      <p>So it sounds like many of the fans who <i>did</i> see <i>Doctor Sleep</i> enjoyed it. Sure, Warner Bros. was expecting <i>Doctor Sleep</i> to open to something like $25 million rather than the $14 million it collected. But money can't buy quality. How many times have we heard about movies that were basically ignored at theaters and went on to be cult classics? <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> comes to mind -- also based on a Stephen King story, mind you.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Stephen King, let's talk about Stanley Kubrick's <i>The Shining</i>. King didn't like it, and it got its ass handed to it at the box office over <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/1980W21/occasion/us_memorialday_weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_table_1">Memorial Day weekend 1980</a>, because a little movie called <i>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</i> opened up the same week. (<i>The Shining</i> was also topped by <i>The Gong Show Movie</i>, so let that tell you something.) <i>The Shining</i> had a very limited release and made $44 million, which wasn't blockbuster money back in 1980 either. (Compare that to the $400 million worldwide for <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>.)</p>
      <p>At any rate, <i>The Shining</i> is still considered a classic. People are still talking about it. Same for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, but not so much <i>The Gong Show Movie</i>. Money is often a short-term story that does not dictate the long-term legacy. That especially true for a movie like <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, which isn't trying to launch more sequels. That's not quite the case for some movies, like <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>, which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483700/is-terminator-dark-fates-quiet-opening-a-death-sentence-for-that-trilogy-plan"><i>was</i> trying to start a new trilogy</a>. Also true of the <i>Star Wars</i> films, which would've probably died back in 1977 if the first film fell flat. Then the box office really does mean life-or-death for funding a future franchise.</p>
      <p>So that's me done babbling. What about you? Have you seen <i>Doctor Sleep</i> yet? Are you planning to see it?</p>
