      <h1>Queen of the South 3 Ayr United 1: Former Kilmarnock boss sinks Honest Men</h1>
      <h2>There was Championship success for Allan Johnston over 10-man Ayr at Palmerston yesterday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:01:51+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <p>Allan Johnston last night saluted his deadly Doonhamers as their second-half super show sank Ayr.</p>
      <p>Goals from Connor Murray and Gary Oliver clinched victory for Queens after Michael Moffat had cancelled out Kevin Holt’s opener.</p>
      <p>Ayr had Luke McCowan sent-off as their hopes of reducing the six-point gap to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-championship">Championship</a> leaders Dundee United crumbled at Palmerston.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queen-of-the-south-fc">Queen of the South</a> boss Johnston believes his top team got what they deserved for taking the game to the Somerset Park high-fliers after the interval.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was a massive game for the fans in terms of bragging rights so I’m really happy to get the result and it was a great performance as well.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Some of our passing and moving was really good in the second half when we totally dominated and thoroughly deserved to win.</p>
      <p>“A few of the guys who haven’t played much lately showed a great attitude and with a wee bit more luck we could have scored a couple more.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a great reaction from the players after the previous three games and they’ve set the standard now. We have a hard run of games coming up but this is a nice way to start them.”</p>
      <p>The Honest Men could have taken the lead after just five minutes.</p>
      <p>Moffat received the ball in the six-yard box and despite being surrounded by four defenders, dragged a shot inches wide of the far post.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ayr dominated the early stages but it was Queens who struck the opener against the run of play in the 18th minute.</p>
      <p>Some neat interchange play on the edge of the box involving Stephen Dobbie created space on the left-hand side for Holt to exploit and the defender emphatically blasted home when the ball was rolled into his path.</p>
      <p>It was tough on the visitors but they continued to threaten and, in the 38th minute, grabbed an equaliser.</p>
      <p>McCowan’s deep cross to the back post found Craig Moore who nodded down perfectly for Moffat to slam home his sixth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Ayr could have gone in at the break ahead when Moffat turned wide from another dangerous McCowan cross but it was the home side who restored their lead with a terrific goal in the 67th minute.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Midfielder Murray started then finished the move when Dobbie threaded the ball through for the 22-year-old to bend a shot into the top corner.</p>
      <p>And Queens made it 3-1 in the 75th minute when Dobbie pinged the ball out to Scott Mercer who pulled back for Oliver to slot home.</p>
      <p>The red mist descended on Ayr three minutes later when McCowan was sent-off for a nasty lunge on Oliver which led to some handbags.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Ayr</a> gaffer Mark Kerr said: “Going into a break is never good when you have a result like that. We were happy coming in at 1-1 but we then lost a goal from nothing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve not seen Luke’s red card but I think we’ve lost a bit of discipline and started chasing around and not kept our shape.”</p>
