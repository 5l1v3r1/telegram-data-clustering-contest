      <p>NAHARAYIM, Israel:  Israelis were prevented from entering Jordanian border enclaves on Sunday (Nov 10) after a deal allowing farmers to work land there expired, 25 years after a landmark peace treaty.</p>
      <p>Since the two countries signed the deal in 1994, Jordan has allowed Israeli farmers access to the territories of Ghumar in the north and Baqura in the south under a renewable 25-year arrangement.</p>

      <p>In October last year however, Jordan's King Abdullah said his country had notified Israel that it wants them back.</p>
      <p>An AFP journalist in northern Israel on Sunday said the yellow gate to a bridge over the river dividing the two countries, long the portal for Israeli farmers to access Baqura, was locked.</p>
      <p>Baqura, known in Hebrew as Naharayim, lines on a spit of land where the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers meet.</p>
      <p>Ghumar, deep in the Negev desert south of the Dead Sea, is known in Hebrew as Tzofar.</p>
      <p>The lands have been privately owned by Israeli entities for decades, but the 1994 deal saw the kingdom retain sovereignty there.</p>
      <p>Since the heady days of Israel's second peace treaty with an Arab state - after Egypt - relations with Amman have been strained.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls have repeatedly found that the peace treaty with Israel is overwhelmingly opposed by Jordanians, more than half of whom are of Palestinian origin.</p>
      <p>In 1997, a Jordanian soldier opened fire at a group of Israeli schoolgirls touring the so-called "Peace Island" at Naharayim, killing seven and prompting then-King Hussein to conduct condolences visits with the families.</p>
      <p>In 2017, an Israeli embassy security guard in Amman killed two Jordanians.</p>
      <p>Three years earlier, an Israeli soldier at a border crossing killed a Jordanian judge he deemed a threat.</p>
      <p>Just last month, Amman recalled its ambassador from Israel over the prolonged detention without trial in the Jewish state of two Jordanians. The ambassador returned after the two were released.</p>
