      <h1>Gladiators star turns born-again Christian and installs assault course in chapel</h1>
      <h2>Ace, real name Warren Furman, travels to churches with inflatables from the original Gladiators set</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:17:02+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author">Ashleigh Rainbird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ashleigh-rainbird/</a></address>
      <p>Gladiator, ready! Pastor, ready! 3, 2, 1... Sunday Service!</p>
      <p>Former Gladiators star Ace has installed Hang Tough rings in a chapel so youngsters can “benefit physically and spiritually”.</p>
      <p>“The body is a temple,” he says. “It makes sense for a church to teach how to look after the body.”</p>
      <p>Born-again Christian Ace, real name Warren Furman, travels around churches with inflatables from the original 1990s Gladiators set, and has now hung the rings from kingpins in the roof at Calvary Chapel.</p>
      <p>Ace, who describes himself as a “Gladiator for the Gospel”, is encouraging the Chapel’s “superfit” Pastor Dave Sylvester to start his sermons swinging from the ceilings, insisting it would grasp the attention of the congregation.</p>

      <p>“He could swing on from one side and his curate from the other,” he laughs. Sadly, Pastor Dave has ruled out arriving to the Lord’s Table via the hoops.</p>
      <p>But Ace – who previously dated <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> – says the rings, installed last week, have already proved popular after services.</p>
      <p>“If you put the Gladiator music on, everyone wants a go,” he laughs. “Maybe it’s not appropriate, you think, as a 60-year-old fellow limbers up.”</p>
      <p>He believes the idea will “catch on” after Norwich Cathedral installed a helter skelter this year.</p>

      <p>“The church has a great big space in the middle of a city,” he says. “What a place where people can come to a fun environment where they’re going to benefit physically and spiritually. It’s a no-brainer.”</p>
      <p>However, his church, York’s St Michael the Belfry, features a snag.</p>
      <p>“The ceilings are 150ft high,” he sighs. “The chains would be a bit long.”</p>
