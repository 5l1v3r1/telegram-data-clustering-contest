      <h1>Neil Lennon explains why Celtic players love 'wonderful' Jonny Hayes as Hoops boss sends John Kennedy message</h1>
      <h2>The Parkhead gaffer singled-out his utility man after his side's comprehensive victory over Motherwell.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:53:20+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon has told Hibs to forget about trying to prise <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> away from Parkhead.</p>
      <p>The Celtic boss admitted he’s not shocked to see the Easter Road club sticking the Hoops coach on their short list for land the manager’s gig.</p>
      <p>Kennedy is a target for the Leith men, along with Motherwell’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson</a> , ex-St Mirren boss Jack Ross, recently sacked Stoke manager Nathan Jones and Liverpool legend Harry Kewell.</p>
      <p>Hibs are expected to make their move this week but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> has no intention of letting his trusted lieutenant leave the building as Kennedy has a major role to play on his coaching staff.</p>
      <p>The Celts gaffer said: “I don’t want him to go but it doesn’t surprise me there’s talk because he’s a superb coach.</p>

      <p>“It’s a feather in John’s cap if that’s the case but as far as I’m concerned he won’t be going anywhere because he’s an integral part of what we do here.”</p>
      <p>Lennon was thrilled his side managed to avoid any Rome hangover in their 2-0 win against Motherwell yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Hoops boss revealed man-of-the-match Jonny Hayes is putting forward a strong case for a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “He is, yeah. Jonny is popular with the other players and he has shown a real reliability, quality and confidence.</p>
      <p>“The pace he brings down that left hand side, he put in several good crosses today. He can play wing-back, midfield or left-back. I’m so happy with him and happy for him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He knows his role within the parameters of the squad. His fitness levels are fantastic, his pace is fantastic along with his enthusiasm for the game.</p>
      <p>“His game intelligence is improving all the time. I thought he was wonderful, so he has been a real plus for me. “It was probably his best game.</p>
      <p>“But he has played in some big games for me - a cup final, a semi-final, a game against Rangers. He has not let me down. He might not be everyone’s cup of tea but he does a brilliant job for us.”</p>
      <p>Lennon hailed his side for going in to the international break on top spot in the Premiership – and maintaining the domestic push after the sensational success against Lazio.</p>
      <p>Odsonne Edouard and Richard Tait’s own goal were enough to see off the Steelman and keep up the feelgood factor at Parkhead.</p>

      <p>Lennon said: “I’m delighted, it’s a great performance, another clean sheet and a good win. We could have won the game by more and I don’t remember Motherwell having a shot on target. That speaks volumes for the way the team are playing.</p>
      <p>“They arrived back in Glasgow at four o’clock on Friday morning and they’ve gone out and played ever so well again today.</p>
      <p>“So I’m absolutely thrilled and really proud of them, not just the ones who played today but the whole squad throughout this round of games. They have been absolutely sensational.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a great week and a great few weeks for us. That’s eight straight wins in all competitions now, so I can’t ask for anymore.</p>
      <p>“Some of the football they are playing, the fluidity of the team and the confidence has been fantastic.</p>
      <p>“Now we take stock and I think some of them need the break because it’s been a really heavy load of games.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lennon admitted his men had to dig deep after a brutal run of fixtures and he’s hoping his international stars come through the break unscathed.</p>
      <p>The Hoops boss won’t make any demands on Scotland boss Steve Carke but he’s wary with the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/callum-mcgregor">Callum McGregor</a> , James Forrest and Ryan Christie having a heavy workload.</p>
      <p>Lennon – who hopes to have Leigh Griffiths available after the break – said: “Hopefully the international boys go away and are successful but come back fit and healthy. It’s difficult. I know Arsenal have done it with Kieran Tierney but it’s also important for Steve to have our players there. Whether we can have a chat about how much of a contribution they can make is another thing, and that goes for the other players as well. Some of them have big games and they enjoy playing for their country, it means a lot to them.</p>
      <p>“They probably like going home for a bit as well, because it breaks up the rigours of the Scottish game as well.</p>
      <p>“There are some things that are out of your control and they’re proud to play for their country. I hope they’re successful, the majority of them are in a good place and we just want them back injury-free.”</p>
