      <h1>Mike Bushell vows to keep dancing after he's given the boot from Strictly</h1>
      <h2>The BBC Breakfast host has finally left Strictly after losing out in his fourth dance-off of the series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:01:04+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Methven, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-methven/</a></address>
      <p>Mike Bushell was finally given his marching orders on Strictly and immediately vowed to carry on dancing.</p>
      <p>The BBC Breakfast sports host lost out to Michelle Visage in his fourth dance-off.</p>
      <p>Now, instead of pro partner Katya Jones, he will strut his stuff with his wife Emily.</p>
      <p>Mike, 53, said: “I’d encourage anyone to take up dancing.</p>
      <p>“Emily and I would like to join a salsa class. And my mum and dad are talking about getting some ballroom lessons – she’s 77 and he’s 81.”</p>
      <p>Paying tribute, to Katya, 30, he said: “I can’t tell you the dedication she puts in. She’d make the greatest sporting coach ever. She makes you believe anything is possible.</p>
      <p>“She hasn’t taken it easy on me. We had difficult routines.”</p>

      <p>Judge Craig Revel Horwood, 54, said he saved Michelle, 51, a judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race, despite Mike putting up a “very good fight”.</p>
      <p>Motsi Mabusi, 38, said Michelle’s American Smooth with Giovani Pernice, 29, was “the clear winner”.</p>
      <p>They scored 36 points, compared to 25 for Mike and Katya’s paso doble.</p>
      <p>Mike said that, despite being trolled, and even sent a death threat, by people who wanted him out, he had enjoyed the show. He said: “The positives of this outweigh the negatives by 99/1. I’ve got a thick skin.”</p>
      <p>Fellow contestant Alex Scott, 35, denied reports that she had wanted to continue with stand-in Kevin Clifton, 37, as her pro partner.</p>

      <p>Alex, an ex-Lioness, was reunited with pro Neil Jones, 37, who missed two live shows with injury.</p>
      <p>It was claimed that she was “fuming”, but Alex said: “I started laughing when I read it.”</p>
      <p>Saturday’s rating for the BBC1 show topped 10 million, while, over on ITV, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity hit a new low of just 2.9 million viewers.</p>
