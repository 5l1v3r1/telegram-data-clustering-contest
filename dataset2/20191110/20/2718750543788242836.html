      <h1>How <i>The Good Place</i> Inspired Manny Jacinto to Propose to His Girlfriend</h1>

      <p>A very important piece of romantic news broke at this year’s Vulture Festival: Manny Jacinto and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/top-gun-sequel-adds-manny-jacinto.html">his incredible jawline</a> are engaged! And we’re <i>so </i>sorry, but it’s not to you, unless your name is Dianne Doan. (Dianne, if you’re reading this, congrats girl!) <i>The Good Place </i>hunk confirmed the engagement <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/vulture-festival-2019-darcy-carden-the-good-place-finale.html">during his panel</a> alongside co-stars D’Arcy Carden and Marc Evan Jackson on Saturday afternoon, and even divulged the very cute backstory that went into the proposal. In fact, it was none other than a <i>Good Place </i>(non-Jacksonville related) quote from his character, Jason, that helped solidify the decision. “I was toying when to pop the question for a long time,” Jacinto explained. “I looked at the Janet/Jason relationship, and there’s a sentence that Jason says to Chidi about relationships and it hit me pretty hard. I thought it was a sign that I needed to do it, and a week later I popped the question.”</p>
      <p>Jacinto wound up taking Doan to a handful of locations that were significant to them as a couple. “I took her to places that really meant a lot to us,” he said. “Where I first met her, where I first saw her, where we had our first date, and where we had our first dance class. I had these canvas things written down with a message saying why the places were important to us. At every location I had her close her eyes, I’d hold up the canvas, and she would open her eyes. I took her through five different places, and at the last place I had our families waiting and I proposed.” Even a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/the-good-place-season-3-darcy-carden-janet.html">not-a-girl</a> would love this.</p>
