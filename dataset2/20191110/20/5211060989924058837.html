      <p>The calendar says early November, but southern Ontario is forecast to be slammed with a mid-winter-style snow storm on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?on61">Environment Canada has expanded</a> a special weather statement to include the City of Toronto. </p>
      <p>Snowfall accumulations of 10cm to 15cm will be possible in Toronto by the time the snow ends late Monday night, Environment Canada said. </p>

      <p>Areas to the west of Toronto and around the Golden Horseshoe could be hit even harder. </p>
      <p>"This snowfall is due to a developing low pressure system which will track south of the lower Great Lakes on Monday," Environment Canada said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"There remains some uncertainty regarding the track of the low, and the expected snowfall amounts."</p>
      <p>Cities like Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Niagara Falls and St. Catharines could pick up 15 to 25 cm of snow, thanks to gusty northwest winds. </p>
      <p>Travel is expected to be hazardous throughout the GTA, with the afternoon commute likely to be impacted.  </p>
