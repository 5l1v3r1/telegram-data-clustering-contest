      <p>BERLIN: Mainz sacked Sandro Schwarz as head coach on Sunday (Nov 10) after more than two years in charge, making him the third boss to be dismissed by a Bundesliga club in the last week.</p>
      <p>Schwarz, 41, was shown the door after Saturday's 3-2 home defeat to newly-promoted Union Berlin which followed last week's 8-0 drubbing at high-fliers RB Leipzig.</p>

      <p>Schwarz's dismissal comes after Achim Beierlorzer was sacked by Cologne on Saturday, and Niko Kovac was let go by Bayern Munich last weekend.</p>
      <p>Defeat to Union saw Mainz drop into the bottom three after losing eight of their first 11 league games this season - the worst start to a season in the club's history.</p>
      <p>Mainz now have a fortnight to find a new coach during the international break before their next game on November 24 at Hoffenheim, who are fourth after winning all of their last six games.</p>
