      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Some Alaskans are calling for greater financial transparency from Hilcorp, the company seeking to buy BP’s North Slope assets.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reported Sunday that Hilcorp asked the Regulatory Commission of Alaska to allow recent years of financial records to remain confidential.</p>
      <p>BP has announced plans to sell its Alaska assets including the Prudhoe Bay oil field to Hilcorp for $5.6 billion.</p>
      <p>The regulatory commission is responsible for the aspects of the transaction involving the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.</p>
      <p>Public comments indicate some residents want Hilcorp to open its records to ensure it has the means to respond to a costly accident in the region that includes the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.</p>
      <p>The privately held company based in Houston, Texas, says disclosure could hurt its competitive advantage.</p>
