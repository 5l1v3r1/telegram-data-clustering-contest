      <p>SAINT PETERSBURG: A prominent Saint Petersburg-based Napoleon expert has confessed to murdering his young lover and former student and dismembering her body in a grisly crime that sent shock waves across Russia.</p>
      <p>Oleg Sokolov, a 63-year-old history lecturer who received France's Legion d'Honneur in 2003, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of murder after he was hauled out of the icy Moika River with a backpack containing a woman's arms.</p>

      <p>"He has admitted his guilt," Sokolov's lawyer Alexander Pochuev told AFP, adding he regretted what he had done and was now cooperating.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was reportedly drunk and fell in as he tried to dispose of body parts.</p>
      <p>After disposing of the corpse he reportedly planned to commit suicide at the Peter and Paul Fortress, one of the former imperial capital's most famous landmarks, dressed as Napoleon.</p>
      <p>Sokolov teaches history at Saint Petersburg State University, President Vladimir Putin's alma mater, and was close to the Russian authorities.</p>
      <p>He told investigators that he shot and killed his lover during an argument and then sawed off her head, arms and legs, local media reported.</p>
      <p>Pochuev suggested Sokolov may have been under stress or emotionally disturbed.</p>
      <p>"He is an elderly person," he said, adding he was being treated for hypothermia in a hospital.</p>
      <p>Police discovered the decapitated body of Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24, with whom Sokolov had co-authored a number of works, and a blood-stained saw at his home.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"SIMPLY MONSTROUS"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The historian, who also taught at Sorbonne University, is the author of books on French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
      <p>He acted as a historical consultant on several films and took part in historical re-enactments of Napoleonic wars.</p>
      <p>Both he and his lover studied French history and liked to wear period costumes, with Sokolov dressing up as Napoleon.</p>
      <p>Students described Sokolov as both a talented lecturer who could impersonate the French emperor and his generals and a "freak" who called his lover "Josephine" and liked to be addressed as "Sire".</p>
      <p>"What happened is simply monstrous," a Saint Petersburg State University lecturer told AFP.</p>
      <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said Sokolov was dedicated to his work but was also emotionally unstable and abused alcohol.</p>
      <p>His former student, Fyodor Danilov, said Sokolov was regarded as one of the university's best lecturers but an eccentric man who at times yelled in French.</p>
      <p>His relationship with Yeshchenko was an open secret, he said. "But everyone was fine with that, it was her own business," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"HUSHING THINGS UP"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many expressed dismay, saying Sokolov had long been known for his hostile behaviour but officials had ignored complaints.</p>
      <p>Vasily Kunin, who studied with the victim, blamed the university management.</p>
      <p>"They did not pay attention to certain things," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>"There was a certain policy of hushing things up."</p>
      <p>Media reports said that Sokolov also beat up and threatened to kill another woman in 2008 but was never charged.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, screenwriter Andrew Ryvkin said Sokolov was one of his lecturers, describing the Saint Petersburg-based university as a place where "alcoholics" and "anti-Semites" felt at ease.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was a senior member of the Russian Military-Historical Society headed by Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky.</p>
      <p>The organisation immediately sought to distance itself from the controversy.</p>
      <p>In 2003, Red Star, the official newspaper of the defence ministry, gushingly described Sokolov as a "serious historian" whose works were published in France.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was also a member of Lyon-based Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (ISSEP).</p>
      <p>On Saturday the society announced that he had been stripped of his position on its scientific committee.</p>
      <p>"We learn with horror about the atrocious crime of which Oleg Sokolov is allegedly guilty," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>ISSEP was founded by Marion Marechal, the niece of Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party.</p>
