      <p>E-commerce giant <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">Alibaba </a>will kick off it's 24-hour shopping mega-event on Monday and is hoping to achieve another record 'Singles' Day' sales this year.</p>
      <p>The shopping festival, also known as Double 11, is referred as Singles' Day because its date, 11/11 (November 11) consists of four 'ones', representing four singles.</p>
      <p>The event, which began in 2009 with a total of USD 7.8 million in GMV, raked in a record USD 30.8 billion in GMV in 2018.</p>
      <p>More than 22,000 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">international </a>brands from over 78 countries and regions will participate in this year's 11.11 on Tmall Global, Alibaba's dedicated channel for cross-border e-commerce.</p>
      <p>"This year's Singles' Day will have many many new records ," Alvin Liu, General Manager Tmall Global Import Export said.</p>
      <p>Liu noted that the first hour of 11.11 pre-sales for Tmall Global saw 113 per cent year-on-year rise in transactions and broke last year's sales record in just 1 hour 47 minutes on first day of pre-sales.</p>
      <p>The 11.11 event serves as a gateway to China for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">international </a>brands and merchants looking to tap into China's market and purchasing power of Chinese consumers, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">Alibaba </a>said.</p>
      <p>Daraz Group, owned by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/alibaba">Alibaba </a>Group Holdings Ltd, first brought 11.11 to South Asia last year and is gearing up again with celebrations in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Nepal.</p>
      <p>India will celebrate 11.11 with the UC Shopping Festival in association with Paytm, VMate and 9Apps.</p>
      <p>The number of new products on offer stand at 1 million and 250 leading <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">international </a>brands will debut with more than 240 '11.11-themed' special edition products, according to Alibaba.</p>
