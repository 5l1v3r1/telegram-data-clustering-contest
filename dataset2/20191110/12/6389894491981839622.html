      <p>The People’s Vote new chief executive has resigned less than two weeks into the job pending an investigation into sexual harassment claims.</p>
      <p>Ex-Labour election strategist Patrick Heneghan has stepped away from the campaign after a tumultuous two weeks in the job, which included mass staff walkouts, a vote of no confidence and a data privacy row.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He was appointed by Roland Rudd, chairman of PR firm Finsbury and People’s Vote co-founders Open Britain, who simultaneously sacked campaign director James McGrory and communications chief Tom Baldwin.</p>
      <p>It was described as a “boardroom coup” by staff.</p>
      <p><i>City A.M. </i>exclusively revealed on Thursday that Heneghan was also the subject of an independent investigation relating to sexual harassment claims.</p>
      <p>He has now stepped down from the position until the results of the investigation are made clear.</p>
      <p>Three young female staff alleged Heneghan had propositioned them and invited them back to his house to take cocaine just weeks before he was appointed chief executive.</p>
      <p>In a statement seen by <i>City A.M.</i>, one complainant alleged Heneghan had been “very handsy with female staff members” and that he “touched them in a way that made them feel uncomfortable” after a People’s Vote march in October.</p>
      <p>Heneghan denies the claims.</p>
      <p>He sent staff an email yesterday, saying he was taking a “leave of absence” pending the investigation.</p>
      <p>“Patrick has said that he wants the opportunity to try to clear his name,” it said.</p>
      <p>“I know that the last few weeks have been difficult for many people but I hope that we can begin to put these events behind us and proceed as a team.”</p>
      <p>Former Conservative party elections official Stuart Hand has been appointed as interim campaign director.</p>
      <p>However, People’s Vote staff have made clear they are not happy there was no consultation before the appointment was made.</p>
      <p>Forty members of staff walked off the job shortly after Heneghan’s hiring, after they voted no confidence in him and Rudd at a fiery meeting.</p>
      <p>A statement from People’s Vote staff said they now feel comfortable re-entering People’s Vote offices, but they are still unhappy with Rudd’s role in the campaign.</p>
      <p>They have called for a meeting on Monday between staff, Rudd and all five organisations that run the People’s Vote campaign.</p>
      <p>“There is a real danger that the errors of the past fortnight will be compounded unless the board of Open Britain finally grasps the opportunity to open a proper dialogue,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>“Above all, Mr Rudd needs to demonstrate he is more than a wealthy man playing politics as a hobby.</p>
      <p>“He needs to show…that this campaign is not his personal property.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Rudd said months ago that he would resign from the People’s Vote campaign, but gave no timetable.</p>
      <p>A source close to Rudd said he is still intending to step away from the campaign and that the timing would depend on the results of the general election.</p>
