      <p>The family of a bride and groom are planning to sue a hotel where a lavish wedding reception descended into a brawl.</p>
      <p>Shocking video footage of the punch up at the Ramada Hotel in Wolverhampton on October 12 was shared by thousands of people across the world.</p>
      <p>Three people were taken to hospital with injuries after the brawl, which is thought to have been sparked when a guest started flirting with other guests.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the bust up but no arrests were made.</p>
      <p>Hotel staff previously said the matter had been resolved amicably but now the couple's family have threatened to sue the four-star hotel franchise for an alleged breach of privacy, after claiming they received an '£85,000 damages bill'.</p>
      <p>They staged a protest outside the hotel claiming staff filmed the fight and uploaded the footage on to social media.</p>

      <p>Members of the family have formed The Ramada Injured Party Action Group, demanding an apology from the hotel for its alleged failings.</p>
      <p>The group say there was a lack of safeguarding at the wedding attended by 500 guests.</p>
      <p>The family have also criticised the police for closing the main gates of the Park Drive hotel for a short period which they claim prevented ambulance crews from accessing the building.</p>
      <p>Some of the group staged a protest outside the Grade II-listed Ramada, wearing hi-vis yellow jackets and holding placards with slogans such as 'Absolute Invasion of Privacy' and 'No Duty of Care'.</p>

      <p>They claim people could have been seriously injured as a result of an alleged poor crowd control. Guests were also suffering 'ongoing trauma' as a result of the broadcasts online.</p>
      <p>But the hotel have refuted all the accusations and say the figure quoted is 'ridiculous', adding it was nowhere near that amount.</p>
      <p>A Ramada spokesman said: "These claims are all fabricated. We refute them entirely."</p>
      <p>The original video footage shows men pushing, punching and pulling at each moments before the fight outside.</p>
      <p>A teenage hotel worker was treated for a medical condition and injuries and two men in their 20s were taken to hospital with injuries sustained in the incident.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police said they have received no complaints about the conduct of its officers.</p>

      <p>A spokesman said: "No complaint has been received from a member of the public regarding any officers involved in the disorder at the Ramada Hotel on 12 October.</p>
      <p>"Officers have conducted extensive CCTV enquiries and spoken to several people present at the venue, however no complaints have been made. Therefore the matter has been filed pending any new information.</p>
      <p>At the time of the incident a spokesperson for the Ramada said: "Having hosted hundreds of weddings we have never seen scenes like this.</p>
      <p>"We do not accept this behaviour and would like to praise the quick thinking of our team who immediately contacted the emergency services.</p>
      <p>"We're in close liaison with all staff members who were present on the night and are ensuring that they get all the support they need.</p>
      <p>"Fortunately, there hasn't been any lasting damage and the room has been fully reinstated.</p>
      <p>"The families of the bride and groom have offered to pay for the damages in full."</p>
