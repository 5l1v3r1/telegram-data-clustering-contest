      <p>MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police say gunmen have ambushed a security force vehicle in Punjab province, killing five people.</p>
      <p>Police spokesman Kaleem Qureshi says dead were two police officers, two intelligence officers and an informant.</p>
      <p>He said they came under attack late Sunday while en route to raid a militant hideout in the Arbi Tabba area of Rajanpur district.</p>
      <p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>But the area borders southwestern Baluchistan province, which has been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baluch separatist groups.</p>
      <p>Islamist militants also operate in the region.</p>
