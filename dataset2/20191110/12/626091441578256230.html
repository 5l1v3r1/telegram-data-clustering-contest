      <p>Slashdot reader <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/~dryriver">dryriver</a> writes: <i>More and more professional 3D software like 3DMax, Maya, AutoCAD (Autodesk) and Substance Painter (Adobe) is now <b>only</b> available on a monthly or yearly subscription basis — you cannot buy any kind of perpetual license for these industry standard 3D tools anymore, cannot offline install or activate the tools, and the tools also phone home every few days over the internet to see whether you have "paid your rent". Stop paying your rent, and the software shuts down, leaving you unable to even look at any 3D project files you may have created with software.<br/><br/>This has caused so much frustration, concern and anxiety among 3D content creators that, increasingly, everybody is trying to replace their commercial 3D software with Open Source 3D tools. Thankfully, open source 3D tools have grown up nicely in recent years. Some of the most popular FOSS 3D tools are the complete 3D suite <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, polygon modeling tool <a href="http://www.wings3d.com/">Wings 3D</a>, polygon modeling tool <a href="https://dust3d.org/">Dust3D</a>, CAD modeling tool <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>, PBR texturing tool <a href="https://armorpaint.org/">ArmorPaint</a>, procedural materials generator <a href="https://rodzilla.itch.io/material-maker">Material Maker</a>, image editing tool <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, painting tool <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>, vector illustration tool <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> and the 2D/3D game engine <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>. <br/><br/>Along with these tools comes a beguiling possibility — while working with commercial 3D tools pretty much forced you to use Windows X in terms of OS choice in the past, all of the FOSS 3D tool alternatives have Linux versions. This means that for the first time, professional 3D users can give Windows a miss and work with Linux as their OS instead.</i> <br/>In <a href="https://slashdot.org/comments.pl?cid=59389034&amp;sid=15149868&amp;tid=384">a comment on the original submission</a>, <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/~dryriver">dryriver</a> offers some anecdotal evidence: <i>Go on any major 3D software forum on the Internet and it is filled with enraged 3D users revolting against forced software subscriptions and threatening to switch to FOSS Blender as soon as possible. <br/><br/>Some major 3D animation studios are also working Blender into their CGI pipeline. Companies like EPIC and Nvidia have begun donating to the Blender foundation. Its happening. The move away from commercial closed source tools - which are expensive, stagnant and don't offer you permanent licenses anymore - is in full swing. The fact that Blender has an innovative GPU accelerated realtime render engine called EEVEE that none of the commercial software has has only accelerated this trend. <br/><br/>Blender is widely believed to have 2 - 3 million active users already, and the fact that V 2.80 comes with a much more usable UI is only accelerating things.</i></p>
