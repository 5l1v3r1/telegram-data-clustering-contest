      <h3>Moussa Wague could finally be set to feature for Barcelona following Nelson Semedo’s injury.</h3>
      <p>Lost in another sublime performance by Lionel Messi in Barcelona’s <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/09/barcelona-celta-4-1/"><b>win against Celta Vigo</b></a> was the injury picked up by right-back Nelson Semedo.</p>
      <p>Semedo came off midway through the first-half. Sergio Busquets took his place and the camera caught him having a few words with Ernesto Valverde.</p>
      <p>Initially, some assumed it might have been a tactical change but the words Semedo was having with Valverde were not of anger or annoyance. He was not playing poorly so an injury looked the most likely explanation.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191109/471481548138/semedo-lesionado-y-sustituido-por-busquets.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a>, Semedo suffered a calf injury that will leave the Portuguese right-back sidelined for approximately five weeks.</p>
      <p>His injury means that Moussa Wague could finally be in line to play meaningful minutes for the Catalans. The 21-year-old has been discarded by the manager and has watched the majority, if not all, the games from the stands.</p>
      <p>When Semedo was forced to come off, Sergi Roberto filled in at right-back. Roberto is likely to take up that spot until Semedo returns but Wague is likely to play the next game against Leganes.</p>
      <p>The reason being is Sergi Roberto is suspended for yellow card accumulations. With Wauge being the only other natural right-back, logic dictates that he should play against Leganes.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese player was the starting right-back for Barça B last season and featured in a couple of games at the end of the season with the first team. But he, alongside backup keeper Neto, are the only players <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/is-it-moussa-wague-time-7721852"><b>yet to play</b></a> a single minute this season.</p>
      <p>Unless Ernesto Valverde decides to play an unorthodox line-up, there is no other option besides playing Wague.</p>
      <p>It is worth remembering that Wague played well with the ‘B’ team and did not look out-of-place with the first team. The only question will be match fitness because he has not played at all this season.</p>
      <p>With the international break coming up, Barcelona should have a bit more time to prepare and make sure that Wague is ready. He will finally get a chance to prove himself and will be eager to take full advantage of it.</p>
