      <h2>Hull City 0-1 West Bromwich Albion match reaction | The Baggies continued their fine form with a narrow away win over in-form Hull City on Saturday afternoon at the KCOM Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T12:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Kemble</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion continued their fine form with a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-albion-hull-ratings-17230238">win over Hull City on Saturday afternoon</a>.</p>
      <p>Jake Livermore's first-half effort was enough to see Baggies through to a hard-worked victory at the KCOM Stadium.</p>
      <p>The win means the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Baggies</a> remain top of the Championship table, two points ahead of second-placed Preston North End heading into the international break.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Hull are in 12th place, suffering their first defeat in four games.</p>

      <p>
        <i>But below we take a look at how our colleagues at <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/hull-city-west-brom-verdict-3520386">Hull Live</a> and their Tigers reporter Phillip Buckingham covered the game.</i>
      </p>
      <p>It was not the happy homecoming the Allam family will have hoped for on their return to the KCOM Stadium, but Hull City’s owners were shown that a side able to challenge the Championship’s best has been built in their absence.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Although Jake Livermore’s long-range strike was enough to sink his former club and earn West Brom a slender victory, City could draw satisfaction from a performance that saw the league leaders matched for long spells of a landmark afternoon.</p>
      <p>Not since May 2015 – a gap four and a half years between games – had Assem and Ehab Allam attended a City home fixture and they watched Grant McCann’s men run the Baggies closer than most.</p>
      <p>Kamil Grosicki, Jackson Irvine and Jordy de Wijs all spurned chances to extend City’s most productive spell of the season as Livermore’s 28th-minute thunderbolt condemned the Tigers to a fourth home defeat.</p>

      <p>Unlike the shuddering setbacks against the likes of Blackburn and QPR, however, McCann could still take heart from his side’s spirited performance. Slaven Bilic’s men were pushed all the way by City, eventually hanging on to a victory that cements their place at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>The Tigers, meanwhile, just four points adrift of the play-off places that McCann targets.</p>
      <p>Seven days after making light work of Fulham, the Tigers struggled to replicate such a measured performance against another compelling promotion candidate.  </p>
      <p>West Brom began with the confidence and authority of a team that tops the division, playing City at their own strengths on the counter. The dangerous Grady Diagnana twice went close inside the box.</p>
      <p>The best chance of the first half nevertheless went to McCann’s men. A probing pass from Jackson Irvine was all it took to carve open the Baggies’ back four but Grosicki was unable to profit, poking wide when one-on-one with Sam Johnstone.</p>

      <p>That miss was made to look all the more costly once West Brom took a 28th-minute lead. George Long had done superbly to deny Matt Phillips from distance but from the resulting corner came an even better hit from distance. Livermore’s thunderbolt denied Long as much as a prayer.</p>
      <p>City were quick to mount a response to falling behind and again should have found a goal to cap their inventive play. Jarrod Bowen’s close-range finish was flagged for offside after Irvine had failed to take the initial chance when denied by Johnstone from eight yards out.</p>
      <p>The Tigers could take heart from standing toe-to-toe with the league leaders and continued to show bite and aggression in their search for an equaliser after the break.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A remarkable run from Eric Lichaj, who first showed trickery and then tenacity to reach the byline, brought a chance for Kevin Stewart but, like so many openings in the second period, City were unable to get a shot away.</p>
      <p>Attack followed attack without an end product and the Tigers were reliant on Diangana missing a huge chance to stay in the contest with 16 minutes to play. A slick passing move climaxed with the winger getting in behind the City defence but his shot was dragged past the post.</p>
      <p>City fought on manfully until the final whistle but a rare chance in the final minute could not be grasped. Jordy De Wijs, so imperious in his defensive work, fired well over from 10 yards out to snuff out the last hope.</p>
