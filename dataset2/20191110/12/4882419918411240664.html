      <p>Former Barcelona winger Adama Traore, currently at Wolverhampton Wanderers, is in the Spain squad after Rodrigo Moreno pulled out injured.</p>
      <p>The Spanish-Mali winger played for the U21 before but this is his first international call-up.</p>
      <p>Adama is 23 years old and was poised to play for Mali before Spain called him up. He left Barcelona in 2015 after coming through the youth academy.</p>
      <p>He signed for Aston Villa, then Middlesborough, and finally joined Wolves on a five year deal, where he has played frequently this season.</p>
