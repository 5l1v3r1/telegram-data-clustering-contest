      <p>Immediately after the event began to air, <b>Riot Games</b> released the official music video for "<b>GIANTS</b>," this year's special single featuring virtual hip-hop group <b>True Damage</b>, voiced by <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/g-idle">(G)I-DLE</a>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/soyeon">Soyeon</a>, <b>Duckwrth</b>, <b>Thutmose</b>, <b>Keke Palmer</b>, and <b>Becky G</b>. The single is meant to promote the release of new in-game skins, similar to how <b>K/DA</b>'s "<b>POP/STARS</b>" promoted a special 'popstar' skin. While most of the lineup is new, Soyeon is back to reprise her role as the voice of <b>Akali</b>.</p>
      <p>True Damage came together to perform the song as part of the opening ceremony, where the artists behind the voices stood on the same stage alongside AU versions of their characters.</p>
