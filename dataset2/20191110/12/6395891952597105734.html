      <p>According to <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/conway-police-officer-suspended-after-dancing-naked-at-nightclub">KATV</a>, cellphone video captured Conway police Officer Cebron Hackett, who was off-duty, dancing and stumbling while nude and apparently intoxicated at Little Rock's Discovery Nightclub on Oct. 13. In the clip, he also appears to push a security guard, <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/conway-police-officer-suspended-after-dancing-naked-at-nightclub">the news station reported</a>.</p>

      <p>A second video shot outside the club immediately afterward appears to show Conway getting dressed and speaking with officers before walking off, <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/conway-police-officer-suspended-after-dancing-naked-at-nightclub">according to KATV</a>. Hackett's wife then gave him a ride to his vehicle, which was parked in Conway, and he drove home, <a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/weird/conway-police-officer-naked-dancing/91-e9abd54d-a81e-4de1-b9a2-3b404e57eade">KTHV reported</a>. He was not arrested or charged, authorities said.</p>
      <p>In a letter dated Oct. 25, Conway police Chief Jody Spradlin placed Hackett on a 30-day suspension without pay, <a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/weird/conway-police-officer-naked-dancing/91-e9abd54d-a81e-4de1-b9a2-3b404e57eade">KTHV reported</a>. Spradlin, who scolded the officer for bringing "discredit and embarrassment" on the department, also expressed doubts that Hackett had been sober enough to drive after the incident, <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/conway-police-officer-suspended-after-dancing-naked-at-nightclub">according to KATV</a>.</p>
      <p>The Little Rock Police Department said its officers weren't aware that Hackett also worked in law enforcement when they decided not to arrest him, <a href="https://katv.com/news/local/conway-police-officer-suspended-after-dancing-naked-at-nightclub">KATV reported</a>.</p>
      <p>In a recent Facebook post, Hackett called the incident a "mistake," <a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/weird/conway-police-officer-naked-dancing/91-e9abd54d-a81e-4de1-b9a2-3b404e57eade">KTHV reported</a>.</p>
      <p>"A few weeks ago I made a huge mistake," the post read, <a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/weird/conway-police-officer-naked-dancing/91-e9abd54d-a81e-4de1-b9a2-3b404e57eade">according to news outlet</a>. "I have apologized profusely for my mistake and accepted the consequences that came along with it. ... Please understand that mistake does not and will not define me."</p>
