        <b>The unrest in Bolivia erupted in the wake of the 20 October presidential election. The electoral authorities said that Morales had secured a new term in the first round, while Mesa refused to recognise the results of the vote.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The opposition’s demand for the president's resignation in the wake of new elections announced in the country qualify as a coup attempt, according to the head of Bolivia, Evo Morales.</p>
      <blockquote>"They demand that I resign, this is an attempted coup .... This is unconstitutional and illegal. I have a constitutional mandate that lasts until January next year," he said in an interview with Telesur.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier, Bolivian opposition candidate Carlos Mesa said Sunday that President Evo Morales should not run for new elections after the Organisation of American States (OAS) found serious irregularities in the vote that took place on 20 October.</p>
      <p>Mesa expressed the view that "Morales and vice president Alvaro Garcia Linera cannot be candidates" in the new election. He also called on parliament to convene a meeting with all political forces to select new members of the High Electoral Court.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Armed Forces of Bolivia have announced in a statement that they have ordered air and land operations to 'neutralise' armed groups that are acting outside the law.</p>
      <p>Bolivian president Evo Morales said that he would call for new elections after the Organisation of American States (OAS) released a report saying that the results of the vote should be annulled due to irregularities.</p>
      <blockquote>"I made a decision to call a new election," Morales said during a press conference broadcast by the ATB channel.</blockquote>
      <p>Morales went on to say he would reshuffle the composition of the supreme election court.</p>
      <p>Reacting to Morales' calls for new elections, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Washington supports the move by the Bolivian president.</p>
      <p>The OAS earlier in the day said in its preliminary report that it cannot verify the Bolivia 20 October election result and recommends another vote take place.</p>
      <blockquote>According to the report, it is statistically unlikely that Bolivia's Evo Morales had the 10% difference necessary to win the presidential election in the first round.</blockquote>
      <p>The South American country has been rocked by the protests which started after <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911101077268646-bolivia-police-guarding-presidential-palace-abandon-post-to-join-protesters---report/">20 October when Evo Morales secured a new term in</a> the presidential election, while opposition refused to recognise the results.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations peaked on Friday, with Bolivian media reporting that law enforcement officers took to the streets and protested with demonstrators in the capital of Sucre and the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. </p>
      <p>On Saturday, the Bolivian government called on the police to engage in dialogue and offered to possibly raise their pensions 100 percent.</p>
