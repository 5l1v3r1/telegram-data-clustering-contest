      <p>A magnitude 3.5 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/earthquakes">earthquake</a> shook southern <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> early Sunday, marking the latest of a swarm of temblors to hit the state over the last few days.</p>
      <p>The quake happened at 1:44 a.m. local time about 13 miles from Palm Springs and 3.6 miles from Cabazon, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. It occurred at a depth of 9.4 miles.</p>

      <p>There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</p>
      <p>Over the past week, there have been three earthquakes that registered as magnitude 3.0 or greater in the same area, according to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-10/earthquake-near-palm-springs">Los Angeles Times</a>.</p>

      <p>Several small earthquakes also unnerved the Ventura County area near the coast, about 176 miles west of Palm Springs, in recent days. While some quakes registered above 3.0, a majority were between 1.0 and 2.0, the <a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2019/11/08/what-do-experts-say-ventura-earthquakes/2531688001/">Ventura County Star</a> reported.</p>
      <p>However, swarms like these are common and don’t foreshadow “the big one,” earthquake experts say.</p>

      <p>“Swarms are common. Similar ones in Ventura in 1984 &amp; 2015. Swarms are NOT more likely to be followed by a big quake,” seismologist Lucy Jones <a href="https://twitter.com/DrLucyJones/status/1192874842137088000">tweeted</a> Friday.</p>
