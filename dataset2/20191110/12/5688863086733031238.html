        <b>While Real Madrid are Paul Pogba’s top suitor but Juventus are willing to offer five players for the Frenchman. The former Juventus midfielder has been heavily linked with a move away and no move materialized in the summer with the Red Devils insisting that they’re not willing to sell their star.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paul Pogba admitting that he’s looking for a new challenge opened the floodgates for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_united">Manchester United</a> and it caused a few problems. However, in the end no move materialized for the French midfielder with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/real_madrid">Real Madrid</a> reportedly unable to afford the Red Devils’ asking price. But Italian news outlet Tuttosport has reported that <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/juventus">Juventus</a> are back in the race and the Old Lady are willing to offer five players for Pogba.</p>
      <p>The report went on to add that Mario Mandzukic, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/emre_can">Emre Can</a>, Daniele Rugani and Blaise Matuidi could all be offered. Manchester United have already been linked with moves for Mandzukic and Can over the last few months and were linked with a move for Matuidi during the summer window with a move close. This comes despite the fact that the Red Devils are unwilling to sell their marquee superstar but reports have indicated that they could be convinced.</p>
      <p>The club’s asking fee is set at around £150 million for the midfielder and a move will only take place if Pogba forces the issue with Manchester United not looking to let him go. Reports indicate that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to build the team around him, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/marcus_rashford">Marcus Rashford</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/anthony_martial">Anthony Martial</a> and a few others which does indicate that the Frenchman’s future lies at Old Trafford.</p>
