      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has laid a green laurel wreath on Remembrance Sunday in Enniskillen.</p>
      <p>In November 1987, an IRA Poppy Day blast in the Co Fermanagh lakeland town killed 12 and injured 68.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and DUP leader Arlene Foster also placed floral tributes at the town’s war memorial.</p>

      <p>The deputy US counsel general in Belfast left a wreath which quoted former US president Ronald Reagan.</p>
      <p>It said: “Their lives remind us that freedom is not bought cheaply.</p>
      <p>“It has a cost, it imposes a burden.</p>
      <p>“And just as they whom we commemorate were willing to sacrifice, so too must we – in a less final, heroic way – be willing to give of ourselves.”</p>
      <p>Veterans from both sides of the Irish border attended.</p>
      <p>Crowds packed the narrow street around the memorial.</p>
      <p>Wreaths were left by RAF air cadets, the commanding officer of the Royal Dragoon Guards from Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire, a Regimental Association of the Royal Irish Regiment, the local council, Ulster Unionist Party, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers Regimental Association and Mrs Foster.</p>

      <p>She wrote: “In proud and grateful remembrance of all those who made the supreme sacrifice.”</p>
      <p>The IRA bomb detonated during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony in 1987.</p>
      <p>Eleven people were killed in the bombing. A 12th, Ronnie Hill, went into a coma and died 13 years later. The Queen and then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher sent their sympathies.</p>
      <p>The Ballyreagh Silver Band, who played at the 1987 Remembrance Sunday ceremony, provided music for this year’s ceremony.</p>
      <p>On Remembrance Day 1997, former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams apologised for the bombing.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Enda Kenny became the first Taoiseach to attend Enniskillen’s Remembrance Sunday ceremony, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the blast.</p>
      <p>It is the second time Mr Varadkar has taken part in the event, and the eighth year that the Government has been represented.</p>
      <p>The Taoiseach also read a prayer at a service in St Macartin’s Cathedral.</p>
