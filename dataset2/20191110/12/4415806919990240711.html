      <p>Chris Packham has criticised Ant and Dec for ignoring his call to stop using creatures on I’m A Celebrity’s Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>The Springwatch host, 58, previously penned an open letter saying teaching young viewers that killing for “exploitative ‘entertainment’” was unacceptable.</p>
      <p>Now Packham has told the Daily Star Sunday newspaper: “Every year, for the past five years, I’ve written to the producers of the programme complaining about the way they stereotype animals and abuse them. I always write to them and I’ve never had a reply.</p>

      <p>“I then published an open letter in Radio Times asking for a personal reply from Ant and Dec. They didn’t reply.”</p>
      <p>The show is famous for its trials, featuring bugs, rats, snakes and spiders.</p>
      <p>Packham said of I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! bosses: “I think they still believe that a significant part of the audience are titillated by animals being abused. But that is wrong …</p>
      <p>“We’ve done away with circuses and dolphinariums. The way we think about animals is changing very rapidly and it’s time I’m A Celebrity caught up.”</p>

      <p>ITV has said the show “complies with all regional and national laws concerning the use of insects, animals and reptiles”.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec are back hosting the show, and posted a selfie on Instagram from Australia with the caption “G’day”.</p>
      <p>Olympian Caitlyn Jenner,  who revealed her identity as a trans woman in 2015, DJ Adele Roberts, pundit Ian Wright, singer Nadine Coyle and Corrie’s Andrew Whyment are among those taking part this year.</p>
      <p>Ant was replaced by Holly Willoughby last year, after pulling out from presenting following his arrest for drink-driving.</p>
