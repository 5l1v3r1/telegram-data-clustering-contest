      <p>While <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/category/crypto/bitcoin/">Bitcoin’s</a> price seemingly moves without rhyme or reason — collapsing by dozens of percent and embarking on face-melting rallies on a whim — the cryptocurrency market is filled to the brim with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/fractals.asp">fractals</a>.</p>
      <h4>Related Reading: Analyst: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/09/analyst-bitcoin-price-likely-to-fall-to-low-8000s-as-chart-remains-weak/">Bitcoin Price Likely to Fall to Low-$8,000s as Chart Remains Weak</a></h4>
      <p>A brief aside: A fractal, in the context of technical analysis and financial markets anyway, is when an asset’s price action is seen during a different time. This form of analysis isn’t that popular, but it has proven to be <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/?s=fractal&amp;lang=en">somewhat valuable</a> in analyzing Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>One recent fractal popularized by a well-known cryptocurrency trader is implying that BTC is going to return to the low-$7,000s in the coming days.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Fractal Implies Retracement to Low-$7,000s</h3>
      <p>A well-known crypto trader going by “Tyler Durden” on Twitter recently posted the chart below, which shows that a Bitcoin price fractal may be playing out. The fractal has four phases: horizontal consolidation marked by one fakeout, a surge above the consolidation phase, a distribution, then a strong drop to fresh lows.</p>
      <p>If the fractal plays out in full, BTC could reach the low-$7,000s again, potentially as low as $7,100. This would represent a 20-odd percent collapse from the current price point of $8,800.</p>

      <p>It isn’t only a fractal that is hinting Bitcoin has the potential to visit its lows. As we reported on Saturday, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/09/key-technical-indicator-signals-bitcoin-may-soon-revisit-7300/">believes</a> that if the GTI Vera Convergence Divergence Indicator flips red, a downtrend could push the cryptocurrency back to $7,300.</p>

      <h3>Can Bulls Step In?</h3>
      <p>But again, many believe it is irrational to have such bearish interpretations of the cryptocurrency’s chart at the moment. As<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/09/stephen-colbert-pokes-fun-bitcoin-monologue-mainstream-gone-wrong/"> reported by NewsBTC earlier</a>, Popular crypto trader Mayne <a href="https://twitter.com/Tradermayne/status/1192888783894544384">recently noted</a> that the “people waiting for $6,000” are irrational. He quipped that Bitcoin retracing and consolidating after its fourth-biggest bull move in history ($7,300 to $10,500, a 42% gain) is perfectly par for the course, but noted that it’s totally possible we can go lower from $8,800.</p>
      <p>The medium-term technicals support this.</p>
      <p>Trader and CoinTelegraph contributor FilbFilb found that by the end of November or start of December, the 50-week and 100-week moving averages <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/bitcoin-see-collosal-golden-cross-2019-precede-price-boom/">will see a “golden cross,”</a> which he claims is far more significant” for the Bitcoin market that other technical crosses.</p>
      <p>Also, a Bitcoin price model created using Facebook Prophet machine learning found that the leading cryptocurrency is likely to end the year at just over $12,000. What’s notable about this model is that it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/19/model-bitcoin-price-drop-8000-bears-done/">called the price drop to $8,000 months in advance</a>, and forecasted a ~$7,500 price bottom for BTC.</p>
      <p>To put a cherry on the cryptocurrency cake, Crypto Thies observed that when Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/03/research-firm-bitcoin-price-bottomed-7300-recovery-possible/">bottomed at $7,300,</a> it bounced decisively off the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement of the move from $3,000 to $14,000, which correlates with the two-week volume-weighted moving average. He added that summer 2019’s consolidation was marked by Bitcoin flipping major resistances into support levels, implying that a bullish reversal and subsequent continuation is likely possible in the coming weeks.</p>
