      <p>Milan will do battle with the Serie A champions on Sunday night, although the encounter does not have the same hype as it use to when Milan were at top of Italian football.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo has had a slow start after only registering five goals in nine league appearances this season, but Poli feels the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is will be tough to stop.</p>
      <p>“How can you stop a player like Cristiano Ronaldo and where would I put him in terms of the all-time greats? It’s very hard to say how you can stop Ronaldo, because he has so many different ways in which he can hurt you: in the air, he can shoot from distance, he can dribble past players… he’s a phenomenal superstar," Pioli told reporters, as per rossoneriblog.</p>

      <p>"You need to be more careful against a player like Ronaldo, those operating close to Ronaldo need to be switched-on, determined and not allow him too much space. Because he only need an inch to be able to hurt you.</p>
      <p>"As for where he is, he’s a superstar, he’s one of the best, with Maradona, Platini, Messi, Ronaldo, Pele… I don’t know, you can’t really make too many mistakes with those. He’s certainly among one of the best players of all time. His goals-per-game ratio is impressive, his ambition too is impressive.</p>
