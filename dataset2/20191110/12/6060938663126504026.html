      <p>RANCHI: People may have termed him as the 'coolest man' on the planet after witnessing him on the cricket field, but <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahendra-Singh-Dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> is always the same, be it on the ground or away from it.</p>
      <p>At a time when the entire cricket fraternity is speculating whether the former India skipper will take a call on his future or continue playing, Ranchi's favourite son is busy spending time with his friends and bikes on the streets of Ranchi.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Dhoni was seen celebrating the birthday of his childhood friend Seemant Lohani at his farmhouse -- Kailashpati -- in the outskirts of the town where all his old friends had gathered to make the occasion worth remembering.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the debate over Dhoni's future, well, that is a puzzle which will need some solving. The former India skipper last met his teammates at the JSCA Stadium here, when India beat South Africa for a clean sweep in the three-match Test series.</p>
      <p>Newly-appointed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bcci">BCCI</a> president <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> has already made it clear that the decision to retire is Dhoni's personal choice and that he will be having a discussion on it with the 2011 World Cup-winning captain.</p>
      <p>India head coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ravi-Shastri">Ravi Shastri</a> has also said that Dhoni has earned the right to retire from the game when he wants to.</p>
