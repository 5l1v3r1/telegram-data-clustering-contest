      <h3>Operatives of the Task Force Aguila (TFA) intercepted some P1 million worth of plastic scrap materials as it was about to exit this free port through the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) gate the other day.</h3>
      <p>Arnel Maguillo of TFA said they received information that a white wing van truck was about to leave the free port without proper bring out documents.</p>
      <p>When intercepted, TFA operatives found an estimated 10 tons of plastic scrap materials inside the container and the truck was brought to the task force office for documentation.</p>
      <p>One Jeolyn Salmoro arrived at the TFA office and claimed that she owns the intercepted materials. But she failed to show appropriate documents for the seized materials.</p>
      <p>The TFA found out that Salmoro had no accreditation from the Clark Development Corp.</p>
      <p>Earlier, TFA operatives also intercepted a white Mitsubishi L300 FB van containing assorted law materials for metal frames from La Forge Designs, Inc.</p>
      <p>The driver of the van, according to TFA, “appeared to be a subcontractor of La Forge.”</p>
      <p>The items were brought to TFA Headquarters for inventory and temporary impoundment.</p>
