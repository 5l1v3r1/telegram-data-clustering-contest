      <h1>Arsenal chiefs 100 per cent behind under-fire Unai Emery despite Leicester loss</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal have suffered their worst start to a season for 37 years after losing to Leicester on Saturday. That result piled the pressure on Unai Emery from fans but the club don't seem to agree</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:47:07+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:47</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is not in imminent danger of losing his job - despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> facing another year of Champions League exile.</p>
      <p>Under-fire Emery has the full backing and support of the Arsenal hierarchy who look certain to keep faith unless the season descends into a real disaster.</p>
      <p>That comes after Arsenal’s defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> which leaves Emery nine points off finishing in the top four with the fans losing faith in the Gunners boss.</p>
      <p>However, the view from the boardroom is that they have built a strong squad, there is enough time to turn the season around and they are confident that Emery can help them achieve their ambitions which start with finishing in the top four.</p>
      <p>Arsenal do not want to pull the trigger on Emery having backed him in the transfer market last summer, including a club record £72m signing of Nicolas Pepe.</p>

      <p>There are concerns in the dressing room about tactics and Emery’s communication while the Spaniard has also been criticised for the handling of the Granit Xhaka fiasco after the Swiss midfielder was stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>But Emery’s three year contract has a get-out option in the summer and Arsenal are ready to bide their time unless results turn badly, with the club facing a particularly difficult month and then the festive programme includes games with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>.</p>
      <p>Board members technical director Edu and Head of Football Raul Sanllehi were both in situ at the King Power Stadium to watch the latest reverse.</p>

      <p>Emery, who still has a year left on his current contract, issued a defiant statement over his future after the defeat to Leicester.</p>
      <p>"We need time and patience. We have changed a lot of players and we have a lot of young players," he told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"We are going to achieve. We have had a lot of circumstances that haven't helped but with consistency, we can do it."</p>
      <p>Asked if he will get the time from the board, Emery added: "The most important thing is to be calm but step up in our intensity and our work."</p>
