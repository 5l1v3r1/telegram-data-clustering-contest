      <p>A cyclist and pickup truck collided, the impact throwing the cyclist several metres where he reportedly came to rest under a parked SUV, described a witness on scene.</p>

      <p>It was raining at the time of collision.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck remained on scene and was reportedly cooperating with police.</p>
