      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/mfbty">MFBTY </a>are back with a new single!</p>
      <p>On November 10 KST, the hip-hop group dropped their latest single "<b>Dream Catcher</b>," their first release as a trio since the release of their 2015 album '<b>WondaLand</b>.' The single playfully fuses rock and hip-hop, creating an exciting mood with a looping guitar riff hook.</p>
      <p>The unique music video for the song is somewhat theatrical, having worked with director <b>Han Sang Bum</b> (<b>IU</b>, <b>Suzy</b>, <b>Urban Zakapa</b>) to put together dynamic visuals the match the powerful energy of the song. The video was made in collaboration with South Korea's <b>Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism</b>, the <b>Korea Creative Content Agency</b> (KOCCA), as well as <b>SM C&amp;C</b> to help promote Korea's fashion culture.<br/><br/>Check out the music video for "Dream Catcher" above!</p>
