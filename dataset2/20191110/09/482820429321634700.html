      <h1>Reactions To the News That Microsoft's Edge Browser Is Coming to Linux</h1>

      <p>"Microsoft is bringing Edge to Linux, <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083423/microsoft-edge-linux-official">for all the Microsoft fans running Linux</a>," jokes the headline at the Inquirer. ("We can just imagine the amount of bunting and party poppers that the Linux community has just ordered. After all, why wouldn't you want a browser from the company that you joined Linux to get away from?") And the headline at Liliputting quips that the Edge browser "is coming to Linux (<a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/11/microsoft-edge-web-browser-is-coming-to-linux-whether-you-want-it-or-not.html">whether you want it or not</a>)," calling the move "the latest evidence that Microsoft's relationship to Linux has changed a lot in recent years.<br/><br/>But TechRadar had an even more sardonic headline. "<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/finance/technology/hell-freezes-over-as-microsoft-edge-comes-to-linux/ar-AAJXAMt">Hell freezes over as Microsoft Edge comes to Linux</a>." <i>One other thing to consider is that the introduction of Edge to Linux is something of a thorny subject in that the folks who choose a Linux distro often do so to break away from the chains of Microsoft and Windows (or indeed Apple). So certainly some of the more fervent open source types out there may not welcome a Microsoft browser with open arms, and doubtless it will be regarded with suspicion in some quarters. No matter how much Microsoft has been banging the open source drum in many different ways in recent times.<br/><br/>That said, there will doubtless be Linux users who are curious, and may want to pick up a mainstream alternative to Firefox on Linux which, when compared to Chrome -- with its famous memory hogging antics -- makes a far preferable choice in some respects. Edge will also do streaming better (by default Chrome limits you to 720p when you're trying to watch a spot of Netflix). All the testing feedback about Edge has been pretty positive in the main thus far, too, so maybe that will persuade even doubters to at least consider it.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure: it will certainly be interesting to see the reaction Microsoft's browser gets when it is deployed to Linux.</i> <br/>Edge may face a rocky reception. "I am not feeling a tingling all over at the thought of Edge coming to Linux," posted <a href="https://betanews.com/2019/11/05/new-edge-browser-linux/#comment-4678336947">one commenter on Beta News</a>. "It's not really necessary to bring Linux down to the level of Windows 10."<br/><br/>But how do Slashdot's readers feel? What's your reaction to the news that Microsoft's Edge browser <a href="https://twitter.com/zacbowden/status/1191451820746522629/photo/1">is coming to Linux</a>?</p>
