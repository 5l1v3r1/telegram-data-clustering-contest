      <h1>What happened to Liverpool and Man City squads from last time Blues won at Anfield in 2003?</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City's last win at Liverpool came all the way back in 2003 as Nicholas Anelka bagged the winning goal in stoppage time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>It’s been 16 years since <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> turned over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on their own patch.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard was a mere teenager, Michael Owen had won the previous year's Ballon d’Or and Nicholas Anelka was only playing for the third of his eventual six Premier League clubs.</p>
      <p>Little did City know that their 2-1 victory would still be talked about now.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Anelka cancelled out Milan Baros' opening goal in the 75th minute before securing victory in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>It would prove to be the only joy that City can remember at Anfield in recent memory.</p>
      <p>But what happened to the starting XIs for that day? We investigated...</p>

      <h3>Liverpool</h3>
      <h3>Jerzy Dudek</h3>
      <p>Has written himself into <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> folklore thanks to his display in the 2005 Champions League final. Although, conceded two goals the last time City won at Anfield with Nicholas Anelka blasting in a late winner. After retiring in 2011, Dudek turned his attention to motor racing where he took part in the 2014 Volkswagen Castrol Cup.</p>
      <h3>Jamie Carragher</h3>
      <p>Played 737 times for the Reds in a one-club career lasting 15 years. The centre-back was described by Didier Drogba as his toughest opponent labeling the former England International as aggressive but fair. Carragher joined Sky Sports in 2013 as a pundit where he is regularly seen alongside ex-United defender Gary Neville.</p>
      <h3>Sami Hyypia (C)</h3>
      <p>Boyhood Liverpool fan Hyypia signed for the club in 1999 and went on to win every competition in English football barring the Premier League. He represented the Reds for ten years before leaving to join Bayer Leverkusen becoming their assistant manager upon retirement. Since then he’s gone on to manage Leverkusen, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> and FC Zurich where he’s received a hat-trick of P45s.</p>

      <h3>Djimi Traore</h3>
      <p>Despite being a Champions League winning full-back, his most memorable appearance came against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> in the FA Cup where he scored a clamatious own goal. An attempted a drag-back on the edge of his six-yard box went horribly wrong as the ball trickled past Dudek into the net. He is now the current assistant manager to Brian Schmetzer at Seattle Sounders after joining the club as a player in 2013.</p>
      <h3>John Arne Riise</h3>
      <p>Fondly remembered for his rocket of a left-foot, Riise’s free-kick against Man United in 2001 almost took the net off as his shot crashed in off the bar sealing a 3-1 win. Riise is currently head coach of Norweigan side IL Flint having resigned as sporting director of Maltese club Birkirkara earlier in 2019.</p>
      <h3>Danny Murphy</h3>
      <p>A central-midfielder by trade, Murphy often had to settle for a place out wide due to competition for places in the Liverpool team. A part of the Reds’ 2001 treble winning side, Murphy was also voted supporters player of the season during the 2002/03 campaign. Since retirement in 2013 Murphy has appeared as a regular pundit on Match of the Day and radio show Talksport.</p>
      <h3>Dietmar Hamann</h3>
      <p>Played the second half of the 2005 Champions League final with a broken toe and instigated Liverpool’s dramatic comeback from 3-0 down. Scored Liverpool’s first in the penalty-shootout as the Reds went on to claim their fifth Champions League title. Currently works as a pundit on Irish broadcaster’s RTE Sport for World Cup and European Championships. Also appearing as a guest pundit on Match of the Day 2.</p>

      <h3>Steven Gerrard</h3>
      <p>Considered by many to be Liverpool’s greatest ever player, Gerrard has won several accolades including PFA Players Player of the Year, UEFA Club Footballer of the Year and even an OBE from Her Majesty the Queen. The 2006 FA Cup final is often referred to as the ‘Gerrard final’ for his role in inspiring another Liverpool comeback and his equalising goal from 35 yards out in the 91st minute. Current manager of SPFL side Rangers having taken charge in 2018.</p>
      <h3>Milan Baros</h3>
      <p>38 years-old and still playing football, Baros is mainly remembered on Merseyside for dropping the Champions League trophy during the 2005 celebrations. Liverpool decided not to mend the dent as it ‘added character to the cup’. Currently plays for FC Banik Ostrava in the Czech Republic first division.</p>
      <h3>El Hadji Diouf</h3>
      <p>A £10 million signing by Gerard Houllier, Diouf netted twice on his Anfield debut but then failed to score for almost seven months. Carragher later stated Diouf has one of the worst strike rates for a forward in Liverpool history with the Senegalese international going the entire 2003/04 campaign without scoring. Diouf was last seen working in home-country Senegal as a government goodwill ambassador and advisor on sport to President Macky Sall.</p>

      <h3>Michael Owen</h3>

Since retiring in 2013, Owen now works as a pundit and commentator for BT Sport and also owns the Manor House Stables in Malpas where he breeds racehorses.</p>
      <h3>Manchester City</h3>
      <h3>Peter Schmeichel</h3>
      <p>Formerly of rivals United, Schmeichel remarkably never lost a Manchester derby during his nine years with United and his single season with City. Upon retirement in 2003, he now works as a pundit on Danish TV and has received an MBE for his services to football.</p>
      <h3>David Sommeil</h3>
      <p>The first City player to score a league goal at the Etihad Stadium, Sommeil made 55 appearances for the club before joining Sheffield United upon release. He was forced to stop playing in 2008 after suffering a heart attack during a training session with French side Valenciennes FC.</p>

Having retired in 2015, Dunne recently finished his A-Licence coaching badge.</p>
      <h3>Sylvain Distin</h3>
      <p>A then club record signing for a defender, Distin was named the club’s Player of the Year in his inaugural season at City and was named club captain the following year taking over from Ali Benarbia. Distin retrained as a strength and conditioning coach after retiring.</p>
      <h3>Niclas Jensen</h3>
      <p>Signed when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> were in the First Division, January-signing Jenson played the remaining 18 games of the 2001/2 season as City were promoted back to the Premier League.

      <h3>Kevin Horlock</h3>
      <p>Frank Clark’s first signing for Manchester City, he once picked up a second yellow card against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> for walking up to the referee in an aggressive manner and asking a question. Horlock is now manages Needham Market Academy in Suffolk.</p>
      <h3>Shaun Wright-Phillips</h3>

      <h3>Joey Barton</h3>
      <p>Barton had to wait five months longer than he should have for his City debut after his shirt went missing away at Middlesbrough when he left it on the substitutes bench at half-time.
