      <h3>THE campaign to meet the mushrooming medical needs of the people, particularly the still growing army of poor Filipinos, is gaining more and more adherents across the country.</h3>
      <p>Elaborately orchestrated by neophyte Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, the drive calls for the setting up of “Malasakit Centers” from Batanes in the North down to Sulu in Mindanao.</p>
      <p>A “Malasakit Center” serves as a one-stop shop for all medical and financial assistance to patients in the country, where many people still die without seeing a medical doctor due to poverty.</p>
      <p>The highly-popular Go, a close friend of President Duterte, hopes to establish “Malasakit Centers” in all hospitals under the Department of Health (DoH), drawing cheers from the public.</p>
      <p>A center houses government agencies with medical assistance programs. They include the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), DoH and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO).</p>
      <p>This removes the burden for patients of traveling to different offices just to receive medical assistance from concerned government agencies. “Huwag po natin silang pahirapan,” he said.</p>
      <p>Aware that the six-year presidency of Duterte ends June 30, 2022, Go has filed a bill seeking to institutionalize “Malasakit Centers.” He said: “Sa ngayon , initiative ito ng Office of the President.</p>
      <p>Last Thursday, Senator Go opened the 50th “Malasakit Center” at the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, the 22nd in Luzon but the first in the Cordillera Administrative Region.</p>
      <p>Unlike other elected government officials, Go, the man his followers call the “Darling of the Poor,” has not shown any sign of backing off from his commitment to help the needy across the country.</p>
      <p>Although many politicians tower over him, people consider Sen. Bong Go as a giant when it comes to helping unfortunate Filipinos, including the many victims of man-made and natural disasters.</p>
