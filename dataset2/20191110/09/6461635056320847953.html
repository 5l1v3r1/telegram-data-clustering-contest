      <h1>Interesting revelations being made about failed Barcelona man</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona were rinsed when they offered a bumper deal to one of their out-of-favour stars and they will surely regret their doing for as long as he stays.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona continued topping La Liga Santander with a slender goal difference lead courtesy of a 4-1 win over Celta Vigo. As is usually the case, Lionel Messi occupied the headlines after a sensational hat-trick but there was a rare fixture in the Barca squad in the shape of Samuel Umtiti, who is expected to leave the club by the start of next season.</p>
      <p>Samuel Umtiti has struggled with fitness since the end of the 2018 FIFA World Cup and Clement Lenglet has done a very good job to become a regular in the squad alongside Gerard Pique in the centre of defence. As Samuel Umtiti prepares for an imminent Barcelona exit, <a href="https://www.diariogol.com/fcbarcelona/zidane-lo-rechaza-y-juega-en-el-barca-de-messi-bombazo-en-el-real-madrid_20005766_102.html"><b>Diario GOL has revealed</b></a> some facts which will majorly trouble the Blaugrana.</p>
      <p>The France international was stunning during the Euro 2016 and his two seasons as a starter at the Camp Nou, but in the longer run, he has turned out to be a liability which earns a big wage and is proving difficult to sell. Real Madrid were offered the chance to sign Umtiti, but Zidane turned down the offer as he did not see anything extraordinary in his compatriot.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Barcelona gave a bumper contract to Umtiti before he went for the World Cup with France, but since coming back from his national triumph the defender has barely featured for the club. However, what Barca would now look back and regret is how they were exploited by the player when he got the new deal.</p>
      <p>Manchester United and Bayern Munich were thought to be in the running for Samuel Umtiti back in the summer of 2018, but most importantly, the player used Barca’s arch rival Real Madrid’s interest in order to get an increase in his payment. As it stands, neither of the three clubs would be ready to accommodate the Frenchman in their squads.</p>
      <p>Do you think Samuel Umtiti would be remembered well at Barca given his demands by using Real Madrid as bait?</p>
