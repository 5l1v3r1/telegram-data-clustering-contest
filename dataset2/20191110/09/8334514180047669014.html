      <p>In a slugfest between the two inexperienced fighters, Briton KSI got the decision on the scorecard after six wild rounds.</p>
      <p>Two judges scored the fight 57-54, 56-55 in favor over KSI, while one had it 56-55 for Paul.</p>
      <p>Each boxer seemed to throw all of their force in the opening three rounds before tiring.</p>
      <p>American Paul landed a big uppercut in the fourth round but was deducted two points when he pulled KSI down to the canvas and hit him in the back of the head.</p>
      <p>KSI was allowed time to recover, and he did so in a big way by getting the best of the final furious three minutes of the fight.</p>
      <p>“I’m a dog. I don’t stop, I keep going,” KSI said, following the win.</p>
      <p>“I was scared to fight last time, I was scared to get close to him; this time I just kept going. I’ve done it, I’m victorious.”</p>
      <p>Paul paid respect to his opponent.</p>
      <p>“I just want to say fair play to JJ, you’re one of the toughest people I know,” Paul said. “He had my respect before the fight, it was all for show. I wish you the best. You’ll see me in the squared circle again, I’ll be back!”</p>
      <p>The online personalities, who boast 20 million YouTube subscribers each, fought to a draw at Manchester Arena in August 2018 before setting up a rematch.</p>
      <p>Prior to Saturday’s bout, Paul’s brother Jake, also a well-known YouTuber, announced that he has wants to fight KSI.</p>
      <p>“I want KSI. I am waiting patiently in the stands tonight to watch Logan beat KSI, and then it’s my turn,” Jake said.</p>
