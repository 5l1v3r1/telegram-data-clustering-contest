      <p>A shopper threatened to kill an Aldi worker while high on a cocktail of drink and drugs, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Andrew Loftus, 25, abused staff in the store in Norton Heights, Stoke-On-Trent and when a manager intervened Loftus told him ‘Why are you harassing me, why are you following me around?’, before chillingly telling him 'I'll f*****g kill you, mummy's boy...'</p>
      <p>When later interviewed by police about his outburst on October 3, Loftus said he had little memory of it because he had taken synthetic drug monkey dust and drunk booze, North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Christy Woods said: “The injured party went to help and saw the defendant, who was described as drunk and very aggressive. He and another staff member approached the defendant and asked him to leave the store.</p>
      <p>“Words were exchanged between his colleague and the defendant, before Mr Loftus turned to the injured party and said, ‘I don’t know what you're looking at, big chest, I will knock you out cold’.</p>

      <p>“The defendant selected items and staff members followed him. He was saying, ‘Why are you harassing me, why are you following me around?’ He then said to the injured party, ‘I will f*****g kill you, you’re a mummy’s boy’.”</p>
      <p>Loftus, of Smallthorne, Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words of behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.</p>
      <p>The court heard pottery worker Loftus has been off sick for several weeks, <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/ill-fg-kill-you-mummys-3517470">StokeonTrentLive reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Simon Dykes, mitigating, said: “Mr Loftus had been making a significant effort to turn things around and there had been a significant gap in his offending.</p>

      <p>“Sadly he suffered a relationship breakdown which hit him hard and he also suffered an injury to his knee. He fell back into substance misuse and drink.</p>
      <p>“He has now accessed help under his own steam. He is genuinely sorry about his behaviour.”</p>
      <p>Magistrates handed Loftus a 12-month community order with a 20-day rehabilitation activity requirement.</p>
      <p>He was also given a six-week curfew - which means he must stay at home between 7pm and 7am.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Philip Taylor said: “You made verbal threats to kill a member of staff in this Aldi store and you had taken alcohol and monkey dust. This was not a very pleasant situation for the person to deal with.” </p>
      <p>Loftus must also pay £225 in court costs and victim surcharge.</p>
