      <h1>NFL Week 10: Russell Wilson looks to underline MVP credentials vs unbeaten San Francisco 49ers</h1>
      <h2>Mirror NFL columnist JASON BELL looks at another huge weekend of action - including Seattle Seahawks vs San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football and Dallas Cowboys vs Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:35:44+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/, Jason Bell</a></address>
      <p>The NFL has some massive games this week, but the San Francisco 49ers vs the Seattle Seahawks is the pick of the bunch, no doubt about it.</p>
      <p>It’s Monday Night Football, the last unbeaten team left in the 49ers, and we’re going to see Russell Wilson, the front-runner in the MVP race, go up against the No.1 defence in football.</p>
      <p>This game is going to check a lot of boxes. Most importantly, if Wilson can have success against this 49ers defence, then he’s hands down the leading candidate to be MVP.</p>
      <p>Wilson is going to have to be at his best for the Seahawks, because, as good, as they are on defence, the 49ers are electric offensively right now.</p>
      <p>The Seattle defence is not one of the beat on the league, especially in the passing game, and they’re going to be tested by Jimmy Garoppolo as the 49ers look to take advantage of that.</p>

      <h3>Cowboys look to recapture mojo</h3>
      <p>On Sunday, the Minnesota Vikings vs Dallas Cowboys will be interesting. The Cowboys started fast, but I don’t think they handled that success well.</p>
      <p>That happens in Dallas because the star in Dallas has been made so big by Jerry Jones. Sometimes, you believe it when you haven't done anything to really warrant it yet.</p>
      <p>I think this team was thinking they were on a fast-track to the Super Bowl after those first three wins, then reality struck.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>They’ve turned things back around this last couple of weeks, and this is a big game to make it three wins in a row and really get their mojo back.</p>
      <p>These are two well-balanced teams and a chance for Dallas to show they are the real deal in the NFC, because they need to keep winning to keep the Philadelphia Eagles off their back.</p>
      <p>For Kirk Cousins, these are the games he needs to be winning. Primetime. Sunday night. Bright lights need a big performance from him.</p>
      <h3>Panthers commit to life without Cam Newton until 2020</h3>
      <p>We’ve seen one of the stars of the NFL, Cam Newton, places on injured reserve by the Carolina Panthers and ruled out for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>The main thing that decision did is it showed the team what they are this season. Now, there are no questions about when or if Cam is coming back.</p>
      <p>Right now, Kyle Allen is the guy. In reality, this is Christian McCaffrey's team, he's the superstar, but with Kyle Allen at quarterback it's his team.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Long-term, I think Cam will come back and still be their quarterback due to the team-friendly contract he has next year, but in the short term, they need to keep winning without him.</p>
      <p>They take on the Green Bay Packers this week, and I really like this match-up for the Panthers against a defence that is not good at stopping the run.</p>
      <p>On offence, they match up well with Green Bay and on the other side of the ball they're also pretty well-matched. One thing Carolina leads the league in is sacks, and that's the quickest way to slow Aaron Rodgers down.</p>
      <p>It's a big game between two teams that are looking strong at the moment.</p>
