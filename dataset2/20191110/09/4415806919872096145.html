      <h1>ESB power plants that are closing should never have been built - An Taisce</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:57:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>An Taisce has said the two power plants in Lanesborough in Co Longford and Shannonbridge in Co Offaly should never have been built.</p>
      <p>It is after the ESB announced both power stations will close next year.</p>
      <p>ESB <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/simply-not-good-enough-esb-to-close-to-two-power-stations-in-the-midlands-90-workers-to-be-affected-962650.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">announced the closures last week</a> saying it was a matter of significant regret, and it very much appreciates the commitment of staff.</p>
      <p>Up to 90 workers are believed to be affected.</p>
      <p>An Taisce said there were political decisions made that were wrong adding that scrapping a plan to ship in biomass from countries like Australia is welcome.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Ian Lumley said the Government ignored advice at the time they were built.</p>
      <p>"The technical advice to Government was that this was an ill-advised investment that would require massive subsidy, which was allowed by the European Union, to an amount of hundreds of millions as well as a capital cost," said Mr Lumley.</p>
      <p>"That was a waste. That investment and that subsidy could better have been put into energy efficiency."</p>
