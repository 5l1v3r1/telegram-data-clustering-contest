      <h1>Scots war veteran breaks silence to reveal he was a top secret code-breaker</h1>
      <h2>Eric Dodd, 95, kept his role at Bletchley Park secret for decades - even from his own family.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:30:11+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">Eaglesham</a> World War Two veteran has spoken for the first time about his vital role as a top secret code-breaker.</p>
      <p>Eric Dodd kept his role at Bletchley Park hidden for more than 50 years – even from his family.</p>
      <p>The 95-year-old is one of just a few surviving Bletchley Park veterans, but until recently, it was only his late wife – and fellow veteran, Lin – who knew of his pivotal war time efforts.</p>
      <p>Shrouded in secrecy, Bletchley Park near Milton Keynes was the centre of Allied code breaking.</p>
      <p>Having volunteered at just 18, Eric went from scrubbing floors at an old mill requisitioned by the armed forces as a training base, to intercepting enemy Morse code from code breaking outposts known as the War Office Y Service.</p>

      <p>Without the work of the code breakers – who have been immortalised in numerous film and TV productions – and special wireless operators like Eric, our history and world as we know it, may have been very different.</p>
      <p>Originally from London, Eric was on duty on D-Day intercepting messages from German troops as they came under attack.</p>
      <p>But like many veterans Eric for so long didn’t utter a word and hasn’t spoken publicly until now.</p>
      <p>“No one was allowed to know what we were doing – my own parents thought I was just a basic wireless operator,” Eric told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride News.</a> “They had no idea what I was actually up to.</p>
      <p>“We were told to never speak of it and we didn’t. The only one who knew was my late wife, Lin, as she was in the service too – that’s how we met.</p>
      <p>“Our own children didn’t even know until Lin and I went to a reunion, in the 90s, and we told them we had been part of Bletchley Park .”</p>

      <p>Eric initially wanted to join the Royal Artillery, his dad’s old regiment, but it had no space and he ended up in the Royal Corps of Signals as a wireless operator.</p>

      <p>After initial training he was moved to an old mill in Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>He went on: “There were two or three hundred of us and for weeks all we did was scrub oil off floors with hot water and ammonia – we didn’t get anywhere near a wireless let alone learn how to use one.</p>
      <p>“Then one day a top ranking general appeared and spoke about looking for volunteers for a ‘special role’ but he couldn’t tell us what it was for and we couldn’t tell anyone – everyone was so sick of scrubbing we all volunteered.</p>
      <p>“Around 30 of us were chosen and we were told we were being sent to a training centre on the Isle on Man.</p>
      <p>“So there I was, 18 years of age, in charge of getting around 30 of us to the Isle of Man - for someone who had never been outside of Watford before it was quite something.”</p>
      <p>By March 1943 Eric was on the Isle of Man learning Morse code.</p>
      <p>Rigorous tests ensued and the numbers were whittled down with Eric then learning to not only decipher Morse code, but know where it originated from.</p>
      <p>He added: “I never sent a word of Morse, but you just listened and listened till you knew where it was coming from – each country has its own system.</p>
      <p>“I was eventually sent to Hampstead in north London where a new section was formed.</p>
      <p>“The messages we intercepted were then sent by motorcycle to Bletchley Park where it was decoded – we didn’t know where Bletchley Park was,it was just a name.”</p>

      <p>In 1944 Eric was moved to a Portsmouth listening post, eavesdropping on a German Panzer division.</p>
      <p>That’s where he spent D-Day.</p>
      <p>He went on: “Each watch had an intelligence officer – he gave you a frequency and you listened until you got something but other than that you were told very little – sometimes the odd thing just to keep you interested.</p>
      <p>“But we had a field near us that was full of Americans who suddenly disappeared, then we had an officer tell us ‘it’s going to be a little bit different tonight – something exciting is happening’.</p>
      <p>“We heard the planes overhead all night and when we came off duty at 8am the next morning we had it confirmed that our troops had landed on the beaches.</p>
      <p>“We knew it was coming as I had intercepted German communications.</p>
      <p>“Usually meticulous, the operators in the panic had started relaying messages in German rather than Morse – and having studied German, I understood their meaning.”</p>
      <p>After D-Day he moved to Northumbria to a direction finding section, which instead of just listening to messages, pinpointed where they came from.</p>
      <p>From there he moved to Y Service HQ in Harrogate in preparation for deployment after VE Day to the Far East where fighting continued – but  the dropping of the Hiroshima bomb on August 6, 1945 meant this never happened.</p>

      <p>It was whilst stationed in Harrogate that Eric met his wife-to-be, Lin.</p>
      <p>She had been based there throughout the war doing the same as him.</p>
      <p>He told us: “We had been playing at darts and the women got fed up of the banging on their wall and Lin being Lin, came through and gave us what’s for – and that’s were it started.”</p>
      <p>Demobbed in 1947, the couple married and put their war time feats behind them, moving to Eaglesham in the early 60s through Eric’s job with Ford and raising their four children.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until an American journalist researched Bletchley Park in the late 70s that Eric and Lin thought about sticking their heads above the parapet.</p>
      <p>Spotting a small newspaper article about it, Eric and Lin decided to open up more about what they had been through and actually set foot inside Bletchley Park for the first time.</p>
      <p>On a visit to one of their daughters in Cambridge, Eric decided the couple would track down the mysterious code-breaking HQ.</p>
      <p>Despite the gates being firmly shut, he managed to speak to the secretary of the Trust restoring it and, as veterans, they were shown around.</p>
      <p>Since the 90s Eric has attended annual Bletchley Park reunions with Lin before she passed away two years ago and since their children discovered their parents' secret, they have went along too.</p>
      <p>He said: “To actually set foot inside it was surreal.</p>
      <p>“When we left the service, in all honesty, we put it to the back of our minds and got on with life.</p>
      <p>“Winston Churchill wanted the whole place destroyed after the war - he never wanted what we did to come out but thankfully it was saved.</p>
      <p>“Finally talking about it after all these years has brought back memories in all honesty I had forgotten about.</p>
      <p>“At the time we were told to do a job and we just got on with it – I wasn’t anymore special than anyone else.”</p>
