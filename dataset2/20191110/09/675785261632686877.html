      <p>Two boys were lucky to escape with their lives after they were sucked into a pipe as they walked home from school.</p>
      <p>Euan Bottomley, 12, was walking with Luke Davies in Holdingham, Lincolnshire, when he slipped into some water, caused by heavy rain, and was sucked into the pipe before being chucked out at the other side.</p>
      <p>Seeing his friend’s PE bag in the water, Luke reached in to grab it, only to be sucked through the pipe as well, <a href="https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/local-news/two-teenage-boys-lucky-alive-3520016">Lincolnshire Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Euan said: “It sucked me in with a lot of force, so much so that I didn’t have time to hang on.</p>
      <p>“I thought at first I would just get my feet a bit wet and thought the water might go up to my knee.</p>
      <p>“When I fell in I was fully submerged.</p>

      <p>“I don’t remember getting out. I just remember putting my head up out of the water about a metre from where I came out.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The river was so overflowing that we couldn’t actually see the pipe.</p>
      <p>“It was so overflowing we didn’t know the river was there – we couldn’t tell.”</p>
      <p>Euan, who couldn’t see what had happened, noticed his bag come through the pipe, only to find some resistance.</p>
      <p>He then realised it was Luke, who had done the same thing as him.</p>
      <p>“Luke told me he saw my PE bag and thought I was messing about so went to go and get it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He said he got sucked though. Both of his legs got pulled and he couldn’t hold on.”</p>
      <p>The pair were unhurt and returned home, but Euan says the incident has left him realising just how lucky they were.</p>

      <p>“If I had got stuck or a branch had been in the way I could have drowned,” he said.</p>
      <p>"The shock made me not cry. Normally at that sort of stuff I would have cried but I was just so shocked.</p>
      <p>“I was a bit traumatised when I got home with me having been underwater.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would have been shallow but in the click of my fingers I was in the pipe.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t breathe for five seconds.</p>
      <p>“Luke told me he swallowed some water when he tried to breathe.”</p>
      <p>The Carres Grammar School pupil broke down when he told his parents what had happened after returning home sodden.</p>
      <p>Stephen Bottomley, who works in the  <a href="https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/all-about/raf">RAF</a>  , said: “He told me he had been holding his breath for five to six seconds – but it felt like forever.</p>
      <p>“Both lads thought they were going to die.”</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old dad-of-two is reporting the incident to the authorities as he fears if something isn’t done to block the pipe then next time there could be a fatality.</p>
      <p>He said: “What if someone does die in the next week or year? How could I live with myself if I didn’t report it?”</p>
      <p>“It needs a gate or something to make sure no one can get through,” he added.</p>
      <p>“It needs a bit of metal to stop people going through or they could both be dead.</p>
      <p>“Both kids could have been dead and we wouldn’t have known for hours.</p>
      <p>“You don’t think about looking through a pipe.”  </p>
