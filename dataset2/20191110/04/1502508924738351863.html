      <h2>Centre-owned ports had handled 62.08 MT of the thermal coal in the same period previous year</h2>

      <p>Thermal <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal">coal </a>imports declined by 17.69 per cent to 51.10 million tonnes at the country's top 12 major ports during April-October this fiscal, latest Indian Ports Association report has said.</p>
      <p>The Centre-owned ports had handled 62.08 MT of the thermal <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal">coal </a>in the same period previous year.</p>
      <p>The Indian Ports Association (IPA), which maintains cargo data handled by these 12 ports, in its recent report said "percentage variation from previous year" in thermal <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/coal">coal </a>handling was at 17.69 per cent.</p>
      <p>As far as coking and other coal is concerned, its handling recorded a rise of 6.88 per cent at 33.43 MT during the seven months period.</p>
      <p>These ports had handled 31.28 MT of coking coal in the corresponding period last fiscal.</p>
      <p>Thermal coal is the mainstay of India's energy programme as 70 per cent of power generation is dependent on the dry fuel, while coking coal is used mainly for steel-making.</p>
      <p>Earlier, mjunction services -- a B2B e-commerce joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL -- has reported 9.3 per cent rise in India's coal imports to 126.91 million tonnes (MT) in the first six months of current fiscal.</p>
      <p>The provisional compilation by mjunction is based on monitoring of vessels' positions and data received from shipping companies.</p>
      <p>The country had imported 116.04 MT of coal in April-September period of 2018-19, according to mjunction - which publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.</p>
      <p>"On a progressive basis (April-September 2019) (provisional), total coal and coke imports were recorded at 126.91 MT, which is 9.36 per cent higher than 116.04 MT imported for the same period (April-September 2018) last year," it had said.</p>
      <p>India is the third-largest producer of coal after China and the US and has 299 billion tonnes of resources and 123 billion tonnes of proven reserves, which may last for over 100 years.</p>
      <p>India has 12 major ports Kandla, Mumbai, JNPT, Marmugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (Ennore), V O Chidambarnar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia) which handle approximately 61 per cent of the country's total cargo traffic.</p>
