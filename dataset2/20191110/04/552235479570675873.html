      <h1>Exasperated cop on Barra in plea to stop drink-driving becoming the 'norm'</h1>
      <h2>PC Colin Scott took to the Hebridean island's community website to warn that drink driving is not acceptable.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Derek Alexander, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/derek-alexander/</a></address>
      <p>It’s enough to drive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/road-safety">road safety</a> campaigners to despair.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> on one of Scotland’s most remote islands have gone to the lengths of issuing an online appeal to locals to stop getting behind the wheel drunk.</p>
      <p>Local bobby Colin Scott made the call amid claims it has become “the norm” for some residents to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drink-driving">drink-drive</a>.</p>
      <p>The astonishing plea was posted on the island’s community website Guth Bharraidh – Scots Gaelic for Voice of Barra.</p>
      <p>It read: “It has become apparent that certain individuals see mixing alcohol consumption with driving a motor vehicle as the ‘norm’ or acceptable.</p>
      <p>“PC Scott couldn’t disagree more. Your licence, job, liberty, livelihood, community respect, personal safety and the safety of others – these are a few things that could be lost through driving under the influence.</p>
      <p>“The legal limit in Scotland is 22mcg of alcohol in 100ml of breath and there is no sure-fire way to ensure how much one drink will impact on each individual’s body until it’s too late. The only way to ensure complete safety is not to drink drive.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It adds: “If you know someone drink-driving, please inform local police. This can be done anonymously and should not be seen as ‘grassing’ but, in fact, protecting one another.”</p>
      <p>Campaigners hit out at the soft approach to drink-driving, which was linked to 30 fatalities on Scottish roads in 2016, according to Transport Scotland figures.</p>
      <p>IAM RoadSmart said: “On a small Scottish island, the relationship between the residents and local police is often very different from on the mainland. However, drink-driving is a crime no matter where it takes place. Police resources may be limited on Barra but the whole community should be working together to ensure its roads are safe for everyone.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Tory shadow justice secretary Liam Kerr said: “I understand police have to occasionally try something different but a simple social media plea is not going to cut this level of crime.”</p>
      <p>The island has a population of just over 1000 people.</p>
      <p>Barra’s SNP councillor Donald Manford said: “Messages similar to this are not uncommon in remote communities. I’m not aware of any change in circumstances but there’s always a level of concern that varies.”</p>
      <p>Police declined to comment.</p>
