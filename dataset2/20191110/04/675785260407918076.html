      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:03:12+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:03</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>As the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle camp gets ready to welcome a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-2019-line-20835125">new batch of celebrities</a>, some behind-the-scenes secrets have been revealed.</p>
      <p>ITV production crews have been working hard  Down Under to ensure the set is ready for its new incumbents and there is lots that viewers don't get to see.</p>
      <p>From smuggling in contraband to secret pregnancies and even a near death miss, there is plenty to keep the show's bosses on high alert.</p>
      <p>The show first aired in 2002 and proved to be a ratings hit from the initial episode. An average of 11 million people watched that first series and that has risen to more than 13 million.</p>
      <p>It wasn't always certain that it would prove to be popular.</p>

      <p>Co-creator and executive producer Richard Cowles said he was nervous before its debut show.</p>
      <p>He said: “On the first series I found myself standing in the middle of the camp, minutes before the celebrities were due to arrive.</p>
      <p>"There was fear - and not just because there were a lot of venomous snakes in the jungle surrounding that first camp.”</p>
      <p>Nowadays, there is a big 'fight' each morning among the cameramen to be the one that gets to film the famous waterfall showers.</p>

      <p>From Myleene Klass in 2006 to Helen Flanagan in 2012 via two stints by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> , the morning shower is often one of the hottest moments on the show.</p>
      <p>And there is plenty of interest among the crew over who gets to be the one that brings the 'show' to the nation.</p>
      <h3>I'm A Celebrity - in numbers</h3>

      <p>In one extraordinary series, The Sun has reported that I'm A Celebrity medics treated the following;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>30 insect bites,</li>
        <li>14 cases of tonsillitis,</li>
        <li>11 cases of flu,</li>
        <li>2 tick fevers,</li>
        <li>30 rashes,</li>
        <li>Removed 100 ticks from celebs,</li>
        <li>Relocated 22 pythons</li>
        <li>And handled 2 pregnancies</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scriptwriter Mark Busk-Cowley, who has been with the series ever since the first edition, says there is a real reason why so many campmates strip off.</p>
      <p>He said: “If you’ve got a hot bod, there’s nothing like wandering around the jungle in a bikini to win some votes.</p>
      <p>“The younger celebrities are well aware of this and, more often than not, it’s when evictions are on that the clothes come off.</p>

      <p>“The moment those phone lines open, you’ll find our sexy young things diving into the pool or heading off to the shower for the third time that day.”</p>
      <p>There has also been cases of the celebrities trying to smuggle in contraband, with underwear and mobiles at the top of the list.</p>
      <p>Former world champion boxer David Haye was caught trying to smuggle in mobile phones while comedian Joe Pasquale managed to enter the camp with six pairs of boxer shorts instead of the one that was originally allowed.</p>
      <p>This has been upped to three after one pair was deemed cruel on the campmates but Joe said that he thought crew members must have assumed he was “well endowed” and he was “looking huge in the southerly department”.</p>

      <p>What is for sure is that the cameramen were rather non-plussed by the contestants body odour, after deodorants were originally banned.</p>
      <p>After protests from the crew, the ban was overturned and show co-creator and executive producer Natalka Znak confirmed: “It was awful. The camera crew were complaining about it, it was that bad.”</p>

      <h3>Not funny in the dunny</h3>
      <p>If the jungle dunny is not bad enough, the show’s co-creator Natalka Znak originally wanted to ban toilet paper and make contestants use leaves.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for campmates, she changed her mind and allowed toilet roll, much to the relief of those heading Down Under.</p>
      <h3>Tara terror</h3>
      <p>Tara Palmer-Tomlinson was the first person ever to do a Bushtucker Trial and it could have been horrific.</p>
      <p>Originally, Tara was meant to have a neck brace to hold her head in place while thousands of cockroaches were poured over her head.</p>
      <p>To Tara's relief, show bosses pulled the plug on the idea as they thought it would be too cruel.</p>
      <h3>No peeking</h3>
      <p>Danny Baker said that the campmates chosen for a Bushtucker Trial are blindfolded before being put in a Land Rover and driven to where the trial clearing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It could have been worse as the original plan was to let the celebs forage for their own food but Natalka admitted: “It was too risky because there were things in the jungle that will poison you in minutes.”</p>
      <p>During the first series of the show, campmates complained that there was no privacy when it came to getting ready.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Co-creator Richard changed this quickly with a simple hack. He said: “I invented what I called a ‘modesty smock’ — basically, a sheet with a hole to put your head through.</p>
      <p>“It turns out it was exactly what they wanted. We’ve used it ever since and never changed the design.”</p>
      <p>The fact that there is toilet roll in the jungle toilet shouldn't be taken for granted as it was originally not on the supply list.</p>
      <p>Show co-creator Natalka Znak wanted to make contestants use leaves, but she changed her mind and decided to allow celebs the luxury of toilet roll in the dunny.</p>
      <p>Possibly the biggest luxury for the campmates is the giant canopy that is cover the camp from 50ft above them.</p>
      <p>This keeps them reasonably dry when it begins to pour down and stops the fire from going out.</p>
      <p>It is not an infallible cover though and during heavy downpours have seen the rain running through the cover and down on the celebrities below.</p>
