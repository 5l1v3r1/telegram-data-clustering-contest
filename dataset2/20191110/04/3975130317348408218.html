      <p>"Wednesday night was an exciting one for investors and employees at American Gene Technologies," reports a local Maryland news station. "After years in the making, they <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/medical-company-believes-they-have-the-cure-for-hiv-aids/">submitted a nearly 1,000-page document to FDA</a>. And within its pages just may lie the cure for HIV/AIDS."<br/><br/>Founded in 2007, the privately-held company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-gene-technologies-international-inc">has less than 50 employees</a> according to LinkedIn. Based in Maryland, the company's milestone was soon picked up <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/08/maryland-medical-company-claims-to-have-hiv-aids-cure/">by other local newscasts</a>, including one <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/national/medical-tech-company-claims-to-have-cure-for-hiv/">attributed to WDVM/CNN.</a> <br/><br/>Long-time Slashdot reader <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/~Aristos+Mazer">Aristos Mazer</a> writes: <i>This is not one of those on-going maintenance drugs. This, they claim in 1000+ pages of FDA filing, is an out-right cure. The drug, AGT 103T, delivers a virus that performs cell and gene therapy. <br/><br/>In AGT's words: "Gene therapy is a technique that allows doctors to <a href="https://www.americangene.com/">treat a disorder by inserting genes into patients' cells</a> to mitigate the underlying genetic drivers of disease. Human cells can be re-engineered to create highly-effective hunter/killers of invasive pathogens or cancer cells, or reprogramed to produce secretions that provide potent remedies to other disease conditions."<br/><br/>If FDA approves, then AGT will have the green light to begin phase one clinical trials in January 2020. </i><br/>"Our aim is to treat HIV disease with an innovative cell and gene therapy that reconstitutes immunity to HIV and will control virus growth in the absence of antiretroviral drugs," the company's chief science officer <a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/08/maryland-medical-company-claims-to-have-hiv-aids-cure/">told CBS Baltimore</a>.</p>
