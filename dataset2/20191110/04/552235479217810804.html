      <h1>Cancer patient claims Sick Kids hospital scandal has delayed vital brain operation</h1>
      <h2>The woman says she is left in agony due to the delayed opening of the new Edinburgh hospital which was to house the Department of Clinical Neurosciences.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancer</a> patient has claimed the Sick Kids ghost hospital scandal has left her waiting months in agony for a vital operation.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old woman says she is forced to take a toxic cocktail of up to 48 tablets a day as a result of the delayed brain surgery.</p>
      <p>It could have taken place at a state-of-the-art neurology unit that was supposed to open at Edinburgh’s new Royal Hospital for Sick Children in July.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> has yet to admit patients after serious safety concerns with the controversial private finance project surfaced.</p>
      <p>Instead, the woman faces a constant battle to control shooting pains that rip through the nerves in her face and head every few minutes.</p>
      <p>She is waiting for a life-changing neurological operation with a success rate of more than 80 per cent – but has claimed a consultant told her four months ago that a lack of hospital facilities meant he couldn’t carry out the procedure.</p>
      <p>A public inquiry into the new mothballed NHS Lothian hospital has now been ordered. It was funded and managed by a consortium set up by Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Futures Trust (SFT), using a model that has been criticised for delivering sub-standard, over-priced public buildings.</p>

      <p>NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government insist the failure of the new hospital to open has not impacted on the woman’s treatment. But her MSP Neil Findlay has described these claims as “unbelievable”.</p>
      <p>The patient – who can barely hold a conversation for the pain she experiences – spoke to the <i><b>Sunday Mail</b></i> at her home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston">Livingston</a>. She said she felt abandoned with a myriad of prescription painkillers piled on her kitchen worktop.</p>
      <p>The pills – including the highly addictive opioid OxyContin, which is at the centre of thousands of lawsuits in America – do little to ease the condition which leaves her wincing in agony at regular intervals. She said: “I want people to know that there is a real human cost to this disgraceful situation.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt in my mind that I would have been given the treatment I need by now had the new neurology unit opened when it should have. I remember reading about the hospital scandal in July and dreading that it would impact on me.</p>
      <p>“Then a month later I was told I needed a microvascular decompression operation. The consultant said he’d be willing to carry out the procedure the next week but there was no chance of accessing an operating theatre because facilities were under such pressure.”</p>
      <p>Microvascular decompression involves opening the skull and exposing the nerve at the base of the brainstem to insert a tiny sponge. It has a high success rate and can dramatically relieve pain and the need for drug treatment.</p>
      <p>The new hospital was supposed to bring together the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, near the city’s Meadows, and the Department of Clinical Neurosciences from the Western General Hospital.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Its failure to open has left both overstretched and run-down existing sites to continue treating patients. The customer services worker – who spoke under condition of anonymity – added: “I feel like I am wasting away, dumped on all these pills and left to fend for myself.</p>
      <p>“All I want is to go back to work and to get back to my old life. I think this operation will allow me to do that.</p>
      <p>“I have total respect for all the doctors and nurses who work in the NHS. I think they do an amazing job and I have no criticism of them. But I think they have been let down by the people at the top.”</p>
      <p>The cancer survivor was diagnosed with a tumour in her tonsils in 2017, resulting in months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>
      <p>Her delight at finally beating the disease was cut short when shooting pains in her face and head developed and grew worse over the next year. Procedures to numb the nerves were unsuccessful, and it was at a private consultation, accessed through her employer in August, that she was told a microvascular decompression operation was necessary.</p>
      <p>However, it was unavailable because of a lack of NHS operating theatre availability in the Lothian area.</p>
      <p>It was only after Findlay raised the case with Nicola Sturgeon at First Minister’s Questions on October 31 that she was finally given an NHS consultation last week and a date for the operation at the Western General early next year.</p>
      <p>Findlay told Parliament his constituent couldn’t get urgent surgery because of the Sick Kids hospital debacle. Sturgeon promised to have Health Secretary Jeane Freeman look into the case and, within days, an appointment was provided.</p>

      <p>The patient added: “I am delighted I am finally going to get help but I know there are hundreds of others that might not be lucky enough to have an MSP who takes up the case and gets some action.”</p>
      <p>Findlay told us: “It is unbelievable for NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government to claim that there has been no impact on my constituent as a result of the shambolic situation at the new hospital.</p>
      <p>“My constituent is a woman who has been living with appalling pain for over two years. She cannot work, cannot drive and has to take around 48 tablets a day to try and stop the pain.</p>
      <p>"Her quality of life is suffering greatly, yet she was left with no prospect of an operation because of the SNP’s handling of the new Sick Kids hospital and neurological centre, which lies empty with no patients yet and is costing taxpayers £1.4million a month.</p>
      <p>“It shouldn’t have had to take me raising this with Nicola Sturgeon to get this woman the treatment she so desperately needed.”</p>
      <p>A public inquiry was ordered in September after patients were unable to move into the new hospital in July.</p>
      <p>The facility is not expected to be fully operational until next autumn, despite £1.4 million of taxpayers’ money being paid to private consortium Integrated Health Solutions Lothian (IHSL) every month.</p>
      <p>Serious issues with ventilation and drainage, along with 2000 “snagging” problems, were discovered.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jacquie Campbell, chief officer of acute services, NHS Lothian, insisted: “The delay to the new Department of Clinical Neurosciences in NHS Lothian has had no impact on this case.</p>
      <p>"The patient has been seen well within the expected 12-week waiting time, given a direct link to the service in case symptoms began to deteriorate, has been shortlisted for surgery and can expect an appointment very soon.”</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesman added: “The patient has been seen within the target waiting time but we, of course, appreciate how distressing it is for the patient to be requiring this treatment.</p>
      <p>“As NHS Lothian have confirmed, the delay in moving to the new site has had no impact on this patient’s case.</p>
      <p>“We are working with the board to support the department of clinical neurosciences and its staff to continue to deliver high-quality care and support to patients from existing sites.</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government, NHS Lothian and other relevant partners are working together to minimise delay in migrating to the new site, which will take place as soon as is safely possible.”</p>
      <p>IHSL is led by Australian bank Macquarie, a firm that was slammed for generating £392million on the back of the building of the M6 toll road in the Midlands in 2006.</p>
      <p>Last month, we revealed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/secret-lobbying-firm-run-snp-20470255">Charlotte Street Partners</a>, a lobbying firm run by Andrew Wilson – a former SNP MSP who was head of Sturgeon’s Sustainable Growth Commission – has been representing IHSL.</p>
