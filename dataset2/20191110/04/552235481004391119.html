      <h1>Crisis-hit private prison boss quits after inmates revolt and set fire to cells</h1>
      <h2>Ian Whitehead resigns from his post at HMP Addiewell as prison officers drafted in from England to help control jail.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>The director of a crisis-hit private <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prisons">jail</a> has left his job amid claims that warders are struggling to control the high-security prison.</p>
      <p>Ian Whitehead resigned from his role at HMP Addiewell on Friday – days after prisoners staged a protest at ­conditions caused by a staff ­shortage.</p>
      <p>A female officer quit her job on Tuesday after failing a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs">drugs</a> test. Five trainee officers also left their jobs in October after failing drug tests when cocaine was detected.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-lothian">West Lothian</a> jail – ­managed by Sodexo Justice ­Services – has been hit by ­problems leading to a prisoner revolt.</p>
      <p>We revealed last week how low staff numbers had led to prisoners being kept in cells up to 22 hours.</p>
      <p>Inmates have set two cells on fire and some refused to carry out duties, including ­serving food at meal times, in protest.</p>
      <p>Management have had to bring in officers from two private jails in England – HMP ­Northumbria in Morpeth and HMP Forest Bank in Salford, near Manchester – as auxiliary staff.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Whitehead was made governor of Barlinnie Prison in 2014 but left in 2016 to go to Addiewell.</p>
      <p>He has been replaced by Emma Stuart on a temporary basis.</p>
      <p>Sodexo has admitted the jail was around 47 officers short.</p>
      <p>A jail insider said: “The place is a joke at the moment.</p>
      <p>“There was a protest in one of the recreation halls a couple of days ago when inmates refused to go back to their cells.</p>
      <p>“Staff tried to herd them out but ended up getting chased back. Everyone eventually went back but only when they decided.</p>
      <p>“The prison officers are ­relying on the inmates toeing the line. But there would be a big problem if they didn’t – the staff would lose control.”</p>

      <p>An Addiewell spokesman said: “We can confirm a prison officer resigned on Tuesday due to not meeting the high ­standards we require.</p>
      <p>“We can also confirm that a small number of prison custody officers were brought in from HMP Northumberland and HMP Forest Bank to assist at HMP Addiewell. They weren’t involved in the direct management of ­prisoners and have since returned to their prisons.</p>
      <p>“Ian Whitehead has decided to leave the company. Emma ­Stuart is ­acting ­director while we recruit a ­permanent ­successor.</p>
      <p>“Short-term ­staffing issues have been resolved, and have been since last ­Sunday. The prison is running ­normally.”</p>
      <p>Last month, almost 100 letters laced with a so-called ­zombie spice drug were ­intercepted at Addiewell. Two officers were ­suspended in July over claims they forgot to lock a ­cell, resulting in a prisoner being attacked.</p>
      <p>In January, a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland Wendy Sinclair-Gieben expressed concerns over staffing levels and the use of inexperienced staff. The report also said some inmates were being routinely locked up as long as 22 hours a day.</p>
      <p>Liam Kerr, Scottish ­Conservative justice spokesman, said: “This is a very ­concerning ­situation. However the wider ­pressures of staffing, under­funding and overcrowding are across the prison estate.</p>
      <p>“Prison officers have been ­operating under extreme pressure for years but this seems to be a significant escalation in chaos and staff issues.”</p>
      <p>HMP Addiewell has been run by Sodexo since 2006 with the contract due to expire in 2034. It was built under the controversial private finance ­initiative and the contract will cost the taxpayer £995million.</p>
