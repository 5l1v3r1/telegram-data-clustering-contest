      <h1>XDA’s Daily Best Value Recommendations! – Singles’ Day Sale Day 2 (Exclusive Coupons can only be used 50 times!)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:14:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/abdulq/" target="_blank">Abdul</a></address>
      <p>The last week just brought to an end the Big Diwali sales frenzy which can be considered the equivalent of Black Friday in India. However, it seems the big shopping spree will continue as Singles’ Day approaches fast. If you’re not yet aware of what it is, let me bring you up to speed on why you should be tracking it. </p>
      <p>Singles’ Day takes place every year on 11/11 and while it started off as a way to celebrate being single, it is now literally the world’s biggest shopping festival. With almost <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/alibabas-singles-day-sets-online-shopping-record-with-31b-in-sales/">$31 billion in retail sales last year alone</a>, the yearly 24-hour 11/11 Global Shopping Festival is now bigger than Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday put together. More than 180,000 Chinese and international brands participate in this sale and we’ll be mentioning some of the products that are up for grabs on Banggood that are worth taking a look at. We will also be <b>giving away coupons (can be used 50 times only for each product)</b> to redeem more discount on the deals mentioned below. So, here’s the list. </p>
      <h3>Xiaomi 10000mAh Wireless Power Bank 10W</h3>

        <img src="https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2019/11/xiaomi-wireless-powerbank-1.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Xiaomi already sells a variety of power banks across different regions of the globe. However, its wireless power bank is not available in many places, especially in India. It’s a fast-charging battery pack that supports up to 10W (wireless) and 18W (wired) USB-A charging. It can charge two devices via the ports and do wireless charging simultaneously. Singles’ Day is a nice time to grab one of these from Banggood as it is being sold for ₹3,308.46. </p>
