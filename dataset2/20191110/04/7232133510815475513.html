      <h3>Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis (BTC)</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, bitcoin consolidated in a range above the $9,000 support against the US Dollar. However, the bulls failed to protect losses, resulting in a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/bitcoin-btc-price-showing-signs-of-bearish-continuation/">downside break</a> below the key $9,000 support area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,317 low to $10,578 high. More importantly, there was a break below a major contracting triangle with support near $9,180 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>It <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/07/bitcoin-btc-price-positioning-for-breakout-or-further-decline/">opened the doors for more losses</a> below the $8,920 support and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). The decline was strong and bitcoin even settled below the $8,800 level.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the price is consolidating below the $9,000 and $8,900 levels. An immediate support is near the $8,600 and $8,560 levels. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,317 low to $10,578 high is near the $8,560 level.</p>
      <p>If there are more downsides, the price could slide towards the $8,330 and $8,300 support levels. The mentioned $8,300 area acted as a resistance earlier and now it is likely to provide support.</p>
      <p>Any further losses may push the price towards the $8,080 support. It represents the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,317 low to $10,578 high.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the recent support area near the $9,000 level could act as a resistance. Besides, the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) is a major hurdle near the $9,100 level. Therefore, a successful close above $9,100 is needed for more gains in the near term.</p>
