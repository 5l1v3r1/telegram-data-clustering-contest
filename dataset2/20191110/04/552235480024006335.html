      <h2>Martha Rafferty was hit with the fine by the Scottish Solicitors Discipline Tribunal after being found guilty of professional misconduct.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>A criminal <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/justice">lawyer</a> with a series of drink-driving convictions has been found guilty of professional misconduct by a watchdog and fined £10,000.</p>
      <p>Martha Rafferty, 59, was hit with the punishment after a hearing of the Scottish Solicitors Discipline Tribunal (SSDT) in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The misconduct finding follows her conviction for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drink-driving">drink-driving</a> for the third time in six years.</p>
      <p>It was also the second time in four years that Rafferty has been found guilty of professional misconduct.</p>
      <p>The SSDT last week confirmed the decision against Rafferty, who has been a lawyer for 36 years.</p>
      <p>It said: “She was found guilty of professional misconduct, censured and fined £10,000.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The SSDT declined to give details of the “complaint” against Rafferty but said a full decision will be made public on their website within two months.</p>
      <p>Rafferty has three identical drink-driving convictions from 2012, 2014 and 2018. On each occasion, she was convicted for refusing to take a breath test. The hearing last month follows her conviction in August last year.</p>
      <p>Rafferty, of Dowanhill, Glasgow, had pled guilty at Hamilton Sheriff <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> to a charge of twice failing to provide specimens of breath to the police.</p>
      <p>The court was told she had appeared unsteady on her feet when she was spotted by officers in the car park at the town’s police station.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, she was handed a 10-year driving ban and ordered to do 200 hours’ unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Rafferty declined to comment when contacted by the <i><b>Sunday Mail</b> </i>last week.</p>
