      <p>US President Donald Trump appeared in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on Saturday, attending a Alabama-Louisiana State football game alongside several local Republican lawmakers.</p>
      <p>In contrast to reports of a warm welcome for POTUS at the game, his floating caricature - 'Baby Trump' balloon - was not so lucky, as it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906051075632879-uk-woman-stabs-trump-balloon/">was knifed by a protester</a> in a park located close to the site where the University of Alabama football game was held.</p>
