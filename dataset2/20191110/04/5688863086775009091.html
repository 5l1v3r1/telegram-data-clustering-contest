        <b>Eden Gardens is set to expect around 50,000 spectators for the first three days of India's pink-ball Test against Bangladesh from November 22-26. Both the teams will be making their debut in D/N Tests and this promises to be a pleasant viewing experience as huge crowds have always been a speciality.</b>

      <p>One of the most iconic stadiums in the world, the Eden Gardens, is set to host India's first D/N Test and naturally large crowds are expected to see history being made. Crowds in excess of 50,000 are expected to watch this spectacle and it promises to be a blockbuster event.</p>
      <p>"More than 50,000 people to witness India's first Pink Ball D/N Test at Eden Gardens each day for the first three days as demand for tickets shoot through the roof," the Cricket Association of Bengal tweeted</p>
      <p>17000 tickets of the 50000 were sold online and the rest were sold to the affiliated members and one of the officials said that there are plans to open sales for more tickets one week prior to the mega event.</p>
      <p>"It's for the first three days and the demands are really high. Rest 16,000-odd will go for counter sales after November 14. We are expecting a full house," the official said.</p>
      <p>Ringing the Eden bell has been a tradition at the Eden Gardens before every game and before this game the tradition will be done by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Union home minister Amit Shah and West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankar will also be among the chief guests present for this event.</p>
      <p>A number of sports icons like Olympic Gold medalist Abhinav Bindra, tennis star Sania Mirza, World Badminton champion PV Sindhu and Boxing champion MC Mary Kom will also grace the occasion as they will take laps of this iconic ground in golf-carts and will welcome the crowds. </p>
      <p>"Specially designed mementos will be given to the dignitaries while they will also make rounds of the stadium aboard golf carts," the source added.</p>
      <p>BCCI President <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sourav_ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> had made his debut as the skipper of India in Bangladesh's first-ever Test in 2000 and thus CAB has decided to felicitate all the members of both the teams who played that Test.</p>
