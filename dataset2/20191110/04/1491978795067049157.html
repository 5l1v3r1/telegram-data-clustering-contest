        <i>Police say businessman masterminded killing of reporters who were helping local people in dispute with his company</i>
      </p>
      <p>An Indonesian palm oil executive has been arrested for allegedly ordering the killing two activist journalists who were mediating a land dispute between his company and local residents.</p>
      <p>Maraden Sianipar’s body was found last week in a ditch near a palm plantation in Labuhan Batu in North Sumatra province. Police found the remains of his colleague Maratua Siregar in the same area a day later. Both had been stabbed multiple times.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, North Sumatra authorities said they had arrested businessman Wibharry Padmoasmolo for allegedly masterminding the plot by paying nearing $3,000 to four men to commit the killings.</p>
      <p>Padmoasmolo owns a firm that produces palm oil, a widely used vegetable oil found in everything from soap to chocolate. The two victims were advocating for locals who were in dispute with Padmoasmolo’s company, police said.</p>
      <p>The killings were aimed at stopping the pair’s involvement, according to authorities, who added that Padmoasmolo has denied owning the firm under questioning.</p>
      <p>In all five people have been arrested in connection with the murder plot and police say they’re searching for several suspects still at large.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for the three, while the five other suspects have been detained for further questioning,” said North Sumatra police chief, Agus Andrianto.</p>
      <p>Sianipar and Maratua worked together for a local online news portal before going freelance in 2017.</p>
      <p>A friend of Siregar said they had recently become known for their activism in land disputes – a common source of conflict across resource-rich <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia">Indonesia</a>.</p>
      <p>The friend said Siregar was active in an organisation that advocated for residents in the dispute.</p>
      <p>Many cases of violence against journalists in Indonesia go unsolved, according to the Independent Journalists Alliance, which has reported at least two dozen cases this year alone.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is ranked 124th out of 180 countries on the 2019 world press freedom index published by Reporters Without Borders.</p>
