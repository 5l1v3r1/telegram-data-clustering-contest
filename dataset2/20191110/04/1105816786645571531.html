      <h1>First census on stray dogs launched in Peshawar</h1>

      <p><b>PESHAWAR: </b>With the number of stray dogs in the city rising, creating panic amongst the residents, the Water and Sanitation Services Peshawar (WSSP) has planned to conduct a census of the animals in the area, the number of vaccines available and to sterilise the aminals to prevent further growth of their population.</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by WSSP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Syed Zafar Shah in a meeting with Livestock Department District Director Syed Masoom Ali on Friday. Shah proceeded to ask zonal managers to complete the census within five days.</p>
      <p>Based on the data compiled by WSSP, the Livestock Department will launch a dog vaccination and sterilisation process.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, WSSP and Livestock Department decided to prepare a detailed project concept-I (PC-I) for the project and discussed details of arranging the necessary vaccines and equipment.</p>
      <p>Ali shared details of the different ways how the growing population of stray dogs can be controlled, especially the non-lethal means. This also includes surgically neutering dogs.</p>
      <p>WSSP and Livestock Department agreed to arrange the necessary funds and equipment for the project in line with the rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>After being vaccinated and operated on, the dogs will be tagged with micro-chips while a ribbon will be tied around their collars to identify them.</p>
      <p>Zonal managers were asked to complete the census at the union council level for which they will be provided with a Pro-forma. The WSSP’s Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (PMER) wing was tasked with presenting the draft PC-I and the Livestock Department will finalise it.</p>
      <p>It was decided that until the PC-I is finalised and the equipment becomes available, WSSP will launch a pilot project on its own by utilising the expertise of the Livestock Department in vaccinating and sterilising stray dogs in a chosen locality.</p>
      <p>Another meeting on this project has been scheduled for next month.</p>
