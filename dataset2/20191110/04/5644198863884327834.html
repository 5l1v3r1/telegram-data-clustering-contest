      <p>MILAN: Inter Milan were rewarded for a relentless second-half performance when a magnificent strike from Nicolo Barella gave them a 2-1 win over Verona after the visitors had taken a shock first-half lead in Serie A on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Barella collected the ball on the left, cut inside and curled the ball into the far corner from the edge of the area for his first goal Serie A goal since joining Inter from Cagliari at the start of this season.</p>

      <p>Inter, who blew a 2-0 lead and lost 3-2 to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday, went back to the top of Serie A with 31 points from 12 games, two ahead of Juventus who host AC Milan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It was Inter's seventh game in 20 days - something coach Antonio Conte has complained bitterly about, saying his squad does not have enough strength in depth for such an intense fixture list.</p>
      <p>"We gave an important response against a team which defends man to man over the whole pitch," said the former Juventus, Chelsea and Italy coach.</p>
      <p>"We've faced these 20 days with strength and intensity. I congratulate the lads, who found the strength to react, learned the lesson and had Verona on the ropes for the whole game."</p>
      <p>Inter gave away a penalty in the 19th minute when goalkeeper Samir Handanovic caught Mattia Zaccagni as he raced through and Valerio Verre made no mistake from the spot.</p>
      <p>The hosts dominated the game and Marcelo Brozovic clipped the crossbar before Verona goalkeeper Marco Silvestri managed to turn Vecino's shot off the line at point-blank range just before the break.</p>
      <p>Inter's furious assault continued after the break and the pressure finally paid off in the 65th minute when Vecino headed in from a Valentino Lazaro cross.</p>
      <p>Verona's Sofiane Amrabat gifted Inter a glorious chance by hoofing the ball back towards his goal from the halfway line and straight into the path of Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian, however, misjudged the bounce and sent a weak header straight into Silvestri's arms.</p>
      <p>Lukaku's blushed were spared by Barella's strike, the midfielder also earning a yellow card for taking his shirt off and throwing it to the ground as he celebrated.</p>
      <p>In the earlier game, Brescia's new coach Fabio Grosso had a nightmare debut as his side were thumped 4-0 at home by Torino.</p>
      <p>Andrea Belotti converted penalties in the 17th and 26th minute, both awarded for handball, to put Torino in charge and Brescia's problems increased with a red card for Ales Mateju before halftime.</p>
      <p>Brescia forward Mario Balotelli was substituted at the break to make way for defender Bruno Martella and Alex Berenguer piled on the misery for the hosts with two goals in a five-minute spell late in the game.</p>
