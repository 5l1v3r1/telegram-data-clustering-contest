      <h1>Man Utd 'weighing up £70m transfer return' of Arsenal summer target Wilfried Zaha</h1>
      <h2>United are reportedly leading the race to sign their former player Zaha, who was linked with Arsenal move all summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly planning a summer swoop for Wilfried Zaha - and will hope to succeed where <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> failed.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were linked with Zaha all summer, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> refused to sell their star man.</p>
      <p>Now United - who sold <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wilfried-zaha">Zaha</a> to Palace for £3.4million in 2015, are hoping they can bring the Ivory Coast international back to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>That's according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10313556/man-utd-transfer-news-wilfried-zaha-70m-crystal-palace/">The Sun</a> , who report that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> are leading the race to sign the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>They will have to shell out for the winger though, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> having had a £70m bid for Zaha turned down in the summer.</p>

      <p>Zaha subsequently handed in a transfer request, furious at seeing what he believed was a "reasonable offer" turned down.</p>
      <p>Palace were unwilling to sell just 48 hours before the close of the window, however.</p>
      <p>The winger had been Arsenal's top target throughout the summer, but they eventually signed Nicolas Pepe from Lille instead for £72m.</p>
      <p>Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson's final signing as United boss in 2013, joining from Palace for £10.8m.</p>

      <p>But he endured a frustrating spell with the Red Devils and was sold back to Palace two years later.</p>
      <p>However, the Sun reports that United believe an older and wiser Zaha can succeed in a second spell at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side signed right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Palace for £50m during the summer.</p>

      <p>Zaha would add pace and creativity to an attack that badly needs it, with United struggling in 14th place in the Premier League ahead of their clash at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>United have won just three league games this season and are five points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>They lost their last Premier League outing 1-0 away to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> last weekend, although since then they have beaten Partizan Belgrade 3-0 at Old Trafford to secure a place in the last 32 of the Europa League.</p>
