      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/time-show-bojo-door-20829109">Boris Johnson</a> has been accused of leaving Scotland “royally shafted” after being filmed boasting of Northern Ireland’s preferential Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Leaked footage has emerged of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/north-border-under-radar-20836524">Prime Minister</a> telling business leaders in Ulster they were getting to keep free movement and access to EU markets under his revised plans for leaving the EU.</p>
      <p>He said: “Northern Ireland has got a great deal. You keep <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-declares-scotland-always-16502042">free movement</a>, you keep access to the single market but you also have unfettered access to the EU.”</p>

      <p>The SNP has argued that Scotland should also be allowed to retain access to lucrative European markets after Brexit by remaining in the Customs Union and Single Market.</p>
      <p>But under the Withdrawal Agreement Johnson hopes to implement, free market access will only be given to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/northern-ireland">Northern Ireland</a> to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-vow-keep-trumps-hands-20834773">SNP</a> candidate for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine Fergus Mutch said: “Despite voting overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, Scotland is being royally shafted by the Tories.</p>
      <p>"Boris Johnson is holding Scotland in contempt, with leaked footage this week showing the rambling Tory leader boasting about the special deal handed to Northern Ireland.</p>

      <p>“Scotland is the only country in the UK that’s being dragged out of the EU against our will and given no say over our future relationship with Europe.</p>
      <p>“That is beyond shameful and frankly makes a complete mockery of claims the UK is a partnership of equals.</p>
      <p>On December 12, voters have the chance to send Boris Johnson a message and escape this Brexit fiasco once and for all.”</p>
