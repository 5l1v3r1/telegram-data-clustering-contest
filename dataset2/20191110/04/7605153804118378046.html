        <b>ALGIERS, Algeria, Nov 10 – Five candidates, including two former prime ministers under deposed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, have been selected to run in Algeria’s December presidential poll, the country’s consitutional council confirmed Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Twenty-three candidates had registered for the election which comes as Algeria has been mired in months of street protests demanding an overhaul of the entire political system.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Kamel Feniche – head of the constitutional council, which validates candidates for the election – said Saturday that only five of those candidates have been selected to run in the December 12 polls, confirming a decision announced by the elections authority a week ago.</p>
      <p>Protesters are opposed to any Bouteflika-era figures taking part in the election, fearing the elite will use the poll to choose his successor.</p>
      <p>Among the five cleared to run, Bouteflika era prime ministers Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune are considered the front-runners.</p>
      <p>Benflis, 75, served as a premier under Bouteflika from 2000 to 2003 and ran as his main opponent in the 2004 and 2014 elections.</p>
      <p>Tebboune, 73, was a senior civil servant and served as Bouteflika’s communications minister when he came to power in 1999.</p>
      <p>Among the other candidates is Azzedine Mihoubi, leader of the Democratic National Rally party (RND) which was the main ally of the former president’s party.</p>
      <p>Islamist former tourism minister Abdelkader Bengrina, whose party backed Bouteflika, and Abdelaziz Belaid who belongs to a youth organisation that supported the former president, are also in the race.</p>
      <p>The election to find a successor to Bouteflika – who was forced to resign in April under pressure from the protest movement — was originally planned for July.</p>
      <p>But the date was postponed due to a lack of viable candidates.</p>
