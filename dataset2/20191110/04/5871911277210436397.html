      <p>Before we go any further, we should note that <b>international</b><b> athletic  commissions  don’t release fighter pay info, so none of the following  salary data for the event is official.  </b>However, you can get a fairly accurate picture of a fighter’s pay based on official purse info released from past fights.  So, based on that info, here is the estimated pay breakdown for the 26 fighters that traded blows at the event.  But please remember – this is only an estimate, not official info.</p>
