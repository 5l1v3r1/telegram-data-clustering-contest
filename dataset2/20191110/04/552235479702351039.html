      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Norman Silvester, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/norman-silvester/</a></address>
      <p>The family of a woman ­murdered 25 years ago say they have not given up hope of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a> catching her killer.</p>
      <p>Shona Stevens was found on a footpath near her home on November 10, 1994, after being battered in a frenzied attack.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old died three days later in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> from head injuries.</p>
      <p>Police have launched a new appeal on the anniversary of her death.</p>
      <p>Shona’s mum Mhairi Smith, 85, and daughter Candice Stevens, 32, still believe someone will be arrested for her murder.</p>
      <p>Mhairi said: “It’s been 25 years since Shona was taken from us and we’re still as hopeful as ever that those responsible for her murder can be brought to justice.</p>
      <p>“I can’t emphasise enough how ­important even the smallest piece of information could be in being able to give me and my family closure.</p>

      <p>“I want to know who was responsible for this attack or why they did it.”</p>
      <p>Shona was attacked shortly after 1pm around 200 yards from her home in Alder Green in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/irvine">Irvine</a>’s Bourtreehill as she came back from a supermarket shopping trip.</p>
      <p>Candice added: “I was only seven at the time of mum’s murder but that does not make it any easier to deal with.</p>
      <p>“I spent a large part of my ­childhood growing up ­without my mum and I would ask­ ­anyone who knows ­anything about the incident to please come forward.”</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Paul Livingstone said: “I firmly believe that ­someone has seen who was responsible for this. In 25 years, people’s allegiances change. They should have no fears about coming forward after all this time.”</p>
      <p>Vital evidence from the crime scene was feared to have been blown away by the downdraught of the helicopter ­airlifting Shona to hospital in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Shona’s death is part of a cold case review. Officers hope advancements in science could lead to a breakthrough.</p>

      <p>Livingstone added: “The investigation has never been closed.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t just stop because we’ve not brought anyone to justice.</p>
      <p>“The support of the local ­community here is vital. We’ll never know what evidence was there or what was lost.</p>
      <p>“The priority today, as it was then, would be the ­preservation of life.</p>
      <p>“Murder inquiries do not just rely on forensic ­evidence. For such a young person with a young child to be ­murdered in broad ­daylight is ­unacceptable.”</p>
