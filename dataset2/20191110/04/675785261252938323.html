      <p>Pensioners aged 90 and over are being admitted to hospital after taking cocaine, NHS research has revealed.</p>
      <p>The report said ten elderly patients were taken to hospital with mental and behavioural disorders 'due to the use of cocaine'.</p>
      <p>The number of people admitted to hospital due to cocaine use within the nonagenarian group remains the same as last year, but it is a five-fold compared with two a decade ago, according to <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/find-data-and-publications/supplementary-information/2019-supplementary-information-files/cocaine-use-admissions-by-age-group-2007-2008-to-2018-2019">NHS Digital</a> .</p>
      <p>The analysis shows a whopping 88 per cent increase in the number of people, aged 60 and above, being treated for cocaine-related disorders in England.</p>

      <p>It went from 45 people a year in 2009 to 379 people this year.</p>
      <p>Dr Emily Finch, vice-chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/aged-90-and-still-taking-cocaine-increase-in-older-people-admitted-to-hospital-with-drugs-effects-vsbbllzsw">told the Sunday Times</a> that the rise in the number of pensioners taking drugs was related to longer longevity, the increasing purity of the drug and the falling prices to purchase them.</p>
      <p>She said the trend is 'deeply worrying'.</p>
      <p>Dr Finch added: "Many people don't realise that cocaine use can cause mental health problems, resulting in people becoming so unwell they need to be admitted to hospital."</p>

      <p>Karen Tyrell, from drug charity Addaction, said: "We need to shift the narrative to let people know that it's OK to ask for help or support at a much earlier stage."</p>
      <p>In April, Chancellor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp">Sajid Javid</a> accused middle-class users of playing key role in the drug problem.</p>
      <p>He was quoted saying: "They may never set foot in a deprived area. They may never see an act of serious violence, but their illicit habits are adding fuel to the fire that is engulfing our communities."</p>
