        <b>Ulster head coach Dan McFarland was a little more optimistic than expected when he spoke to the media after seeing his side fall to a second defeat of the season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The northern province led Munster by a point with a quarter of the game remaining in Thomond Park but they weren’t able to capitalise any further as Andrew Conway’s sublime try 15 minutes from the full-time whistle proved the difference.</p>
      <p>This was a game which Ulster could and perhaps should have won but McFarland was evidently looking at the bigger picture.</p>
      <p>His side pushed Munster all the way in a fixture where they leaked 64 points last season and he knows that progress has been made in that period.</p>
      <p>“In Thomond Park it’s intense and, for large parts of that game, physically we were excellent,” McFarland said of his side’s performance.</p>

      <p>“We needed to be because it’s Munster in Munster.”</p>
      <p>“To put yourself in a position where at 63, 64 minutes you’re a point ahead the game’s there for the taking, then to lose it is really disappointing,” McFarland continued.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, we turned the ball over in contact too much. Not handling errors, not passing errors, just in the bang and bash of contact.</p>
      <blockquote>”If we’d held onto the ball I think we would have caused them problems.<br/><br/>“I was proud of our physicality, proud of our set-piece. I thought that went well. Against a really excellent scrum and maul, I thought we did well.”</blockquote>
      <p>Next up for Ulster is a trip to Bath in the opening round of this season’s Champions Cup and the head coach will take confidence from how his side went toe-to-toe with a Munster team who pride themselves on a very strong setpiece.</p>
      <p>“We go from one European fortress to another. Bath for a long time have prided themselves on set-piece and anyone playing in the Premiership has to be good at set-piece. We’ll have to step it up a gear going into Europe.”</p>
