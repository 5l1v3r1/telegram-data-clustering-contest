      <h1>Ethereum Co-Founder: Hopefully We Can Interoperate With China’s Crypto</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:36:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:36</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> co-founder and founder of Consensys, Joseph Lubin, said that he hopes China’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will allow for interoperability with public permissionless blockchains, including Ethereum.</p>
      <h3>Ethereum is “a very positive virus”</h3>
      <p>Lubin made his remarks during an interview with Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/11/09/joe-lubin-talks-trump-blockchains-frankenstein-and-willingness-to-work-with-china/#3617b4c778bc">published</a> on Nov. 9. He explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“I assume it is going to be exactly what Chinese leadership thinks is most beneficial to Chinese leadership. Hopefully that’s also open and we can interoperate with it, but I don’t know.”</blockquote>
      <p>Furthermore, Lubin added that he would like to see more participation from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a> in the Ethereum ecosystem. He cited the case of the Belt and Road blockchain-based commerce platform, noting that it uses one of the “weaker technologies” compared to public blockchains like Ethereum. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I would love to help China get expert in Ethereum technology. [...] The main idea is that Ethereum is the strongest of the blockchain technologies and it’s a very positive virus to implant in people’s minds.”</blockquote>
      <p>Lubin also noted that he expects that China will continue to undermine the U.S. dollar’s status as the world reserve currency. But he also believes that China’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ibm-expects-a-central-bank-to-issue-digital-currency-within-5-years">CBCD</a> will only have a minor impact in this regard. He pointed out that Russia and China are making efforts to conduct business without using the U.S. dollar and concluded:</p>
      <blockquote>“There are lots of reasons why American influence is shrinking and will probably continue to shrink. That may not be a bad thing but in some ways, it’ll be a bad thing. China’s particular cryptocurrency I don’t think is a major factor.”</blockquote>
      <h3>China can censor crypto “if it wants to”</h3>
      <p>Lubin also addressed China’s willingness to obstruct access to digital currencies competing with its own, including Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>). He explained that the government’s ability to impede access to Ethereum in China depends on progress in deep packet inspection and how motivated the nation is to this end.</p>
      <p>In the end, he admits that the Chinese government “can do it if it wants to.” Still, new technologies such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-from-space-blockstream-cso-explains-its-satellite-services">satellite-blockchain streaming</a> and mesh networking could provide a way to circumvent censorship.</p>
      <p>When asked whether he believes China’s CBDC implementation could subvert blockchain's benefits or abuse blockchain's transparency to monitor and control every citizen’s transactions, Lubin said:</p>
      <blockquote>“China is a business that writes its own rules and has an enormous customer base — 1.4 billion people. That’s a tough economic force to compete with. I do think there’s an instability. I think leaders are constantly terrified of revolution, so they have to keep the people relatively happy at some baseline level.”</blockquote>
