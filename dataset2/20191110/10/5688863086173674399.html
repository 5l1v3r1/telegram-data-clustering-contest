        <b>Ahead of the 3rd and decisive T20I between India and Bangladesh, the visitors have faced a double blow with Mustafizur Rahman and Mosaddek Hossain hit by injuries. The final game of the three-match T20I series is set to be held on Sunday, November 10, at Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium. </b>
      </p>
      <p>To start with, Bangladesh toured India without the banned <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shakib_al_hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a> and now they will be playing without the all-rounder Mosaddek Hossain and fast bowler <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mustafizur_rahman">Mustafizur Rahman</a> for the third and final T20I against a <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a>-led India. According to a leading Bangladesh website BDCrictime, Hossain has sustained a groin niggle and is struggling ahead of the T20I.</p>
      <p>According to the report, both Rahman and Hossain missed the practice session on the eve of the Nagpur T20I, on Saturday.  If Hossain can’t play then Mohammad Mithun might be named as his replacement. For Rahman, Taijul Islam might be considered to be brought in the playing XI but the 27-year-old left-arm legspinner has only played two T20I so far for Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>According to Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo, as reported by BDCrictime, they will take a call on who to play only after looking at the pitch. Meanwhile, India are likely to go ahead with an unchanged XI. </p>
