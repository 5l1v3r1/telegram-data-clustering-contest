      <h1>Not a Surprise: Tron (TRX) To Be Added To Poloniex Exchange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:01:20+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Lyanchev</a></address>
      <p>TRON (TRX), one of the largest altcoins, will be listed on the cryptocurrency exchange – Poloniex on November 12th. The news comes after the exchange was recently sold to new owners who are reportedly set to increase Asian involvement.</p>
      <h3>TRON To Be Added On Poloniex</h3>
      <p>According to an <a href="https://medium.com/@Poloniex/tron-trx-is-coming-to-poloniex-soon-b4fc79f29a77">official statement</a>, TRX, which is currently ranked as the 11th largest cryptocurrency, will be listed on one of the popular exchanges, Poloniex. TRX sits on a market cap slightly over $1.1 billion and marks a slight increase of around 1.5% at the time of this writing.</p>
      <p>As of November 12th at 15:00 UTC, users will be able to start posting limit orders for TRX/BTC, TRX/USDT, and TRX/USDC. Reportedly, only limit orders will be available at first, and full trading will be enabled “shortly after this date.” In the coming days, TRX deposits and withdrawals will be allowed as well.</p>
      <p>Tron’s listing on Poloniex was also <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1193409911478198272">confirmed</a> by the Founder and CEO of the popular cryptocurrency – Justin Sun.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that the Poloniex team recently <a href="https://blog.circle.com/2019/10/18/poloniex-to-spin-out-of-circle/">announced</a> that they will be spinning out of Circle into “a new independent international company – Polo Digital Assets, Ltd. Backed by an Asian investment group, the spin-out will bring significant resources and freedom to deliver the product features and marketing strategies needed to be competitive.”</p>
      <p>With Poloniex’s recent spin-out from Circle to an Asian investment backing, TRX’s listing on their platform might not come as a surprise.</p>
      <h3>Further Updates From Tron</h3>
      <p>Arguably, the most significant news came when the company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/breaking-tron-will-now-be-available-in-samsungs-blockchain-keystore/">announced</a> a partnership with the tech giant – Samsung. TRON’s blockchain was added to Samsung’s Blockchain Keystore, allowing those using the Keystore SDK to create decentralized applications on it.</p>
      <p>The company recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tron-trx-spikes-19-following-justin-suns-protocol-update-news/">updated</a> its Odyssey protocol. With it, the network incentive mechanism has reportedly reached full decentralization as the rewards data will be accessible by everyone, thus making sure that the voters’ rewards are secured.</p>
      <p>Just a week ago TRON Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/Tronfoundation/status/1190940721521414145">announced</a> that TRX is also to be listed on McAfeeDex – the decentralized exchange, which was recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-mcafee-sets-to-launch-mcafeedex-today-a-no-restrictions-decentralized-exchange/">launched</a> by former antivirus software tycoon – John McAfee.</p>
