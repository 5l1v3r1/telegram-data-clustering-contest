      <p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> have released a photo of a tattoo on the remains of a woman whose partially decomposed body was found last month in a wooded area of Valley Township, hoping someone will recognize the design and help <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons">identify</a> her, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Investigators were unable to match the body with any known <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/missing-persons">missing persons</a> from the area.</p>
      <p>Investigators said the woman, who was likely white or Hispanic, between ages 16 and 40, had a tattoo of a ram (or a Capricorn astrological sign) on her hip, according to The Philly Voice.</p>
