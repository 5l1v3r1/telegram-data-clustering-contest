      <p>Midfield playmaker Danny Mayor was back in the fold for Plymouth Argyle as they beat Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>But his return meant that George Cooper was left out for the first round tie at the University of Bolton Stadium.</p>
      <p>Cooper, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">who was Plymouth Live’s Argyle player-of-the-month for October</a>, was an unused substitute for the 1-0 win.</p>
      <p>It was good to see after the game that Cooper took to social media to praise his team-mates for their ‘great performance’ and add that he was ‘buzzing for the fans’.</p>
      <p>However, the loan signing from Peterborough United must have been disappointed not to have featured in the tie.</p>
      <p>A valid question to ask now is whether Pilgrims’ boss Ryan Lowe can find a way to accommodate two such talented players as Mayor and Cooper in the same side?</p>
      <p>On their day, both are capable of being matchwinners, as they have already proven this season.</p>
      <p>If Argyle are to start pushing up the League Two table towards the play-off positions in the coming weeks they will need the quality that Mayor and Cooper can bring.</p>
      <p>It is a case of how Lowe fits them into the same team and there is no obvious solution.</p>
      <p>Mayor had two games as a substitute after serving a one-match suspension when the Pilgrims beat Carlisle United 2-0 at Home Park on October 19.</p>
      <p>Now refreshed and restored to the starting line-up, he will surely be one of the first names on the teamsheet every week.</p>
      <p>While he has perhaps not hit the heights that some expected of him, the 28-year-old has still been a key part of their attacking play.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Mayor has scored only once this season but he has had a number of assists and has linked up on the left superbly with wing-back Callum McFadzean.</p>
      <p>That almost instinctive understanding was again evident at Bolton where Mayor provided the cross for McFadzean to score the decisive goal of the tie with an emphatic finish.</p>
      <p>Mayor also forced Bolton’s former Argyle ‘keeper Remi Matthews, into a fine diving save soon afterwards.</p>
      <p>With McFadzean and Mayor so influential for the Pilgrims on the left, there seems no prospect of the extremely versatile Cooper playing in either of their positions.</p>
      <p>The midfield holding role is set to be a choice between Joe Edwards and Josh Grant, who started there against Bolton and impressed.</p>
      <p>Jose Baxter is another alternative for that position, provided he can overcome the calf injury which has troubled him for almost a couple of months now.</p>
      <p>Antoni Sarcevic has been one of Argyle’s most consistent players this season in central midfield.</p>
      <p>So with him and Mayor occupying those two spots in the side, it leaves Cooper with either a right wing-back role or possibly playing up front.</p>
      <p>Lowe now has six fit strikers to select from – Joel Grant, Byron Moore, who both started against Bolton, as well as Billy Clarke, Dom Telford, Ryan Taylor and Zak Rudden.</p>
      <p>Rudden, the loan signing from Glasgow Rangers, did not even make the squad for the FA Cup clash such was the competition for places.</p>
      <p>So, realistically, right wing-back seems the most likely role for Cooper to take on.</p>
      <p>However, Edwards can play there effectively, as he did against Bolton, and Riley is another alternative when fit so Lowe has choices there too.</p>

      <p>Argyle have the option to sign Cooper on a permanent deal from Peterborough in January.</p>
      <p>But, first of all, he needs to be playing regularly for either party to seriously consider that.</p>
      <p>Lowe has made no secret of the fact how highly he rates Cooper but if everyone is fit and on form it is clearly not a given that the Pilgrims’ loanee will be selected.</p>
      <p>It will be fascinating to see how that unfolds over the next couple of months leading up to January.</p>
