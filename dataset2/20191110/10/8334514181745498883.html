      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid said the opposition Labour Party’s spending plans would trigger an economic crisis within months, citing a contested dossier published by his Conservative Party and refusing to give costs for his own fiscal strategy.</p>
      <p>“These are eye-watering levels of spending - 1.2 trillion (pounds) - it will be absolutely reckless and will leave this country with an economic crisis within months,” Javid told the BBC on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party have dismissed the Conservative analysis of their spending plans, and have yet to publish their full manifesto.</p>
