      <p>Earlier this week (November 6), <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/looks-like-frank-ocean-justice-collaboration-happening-2564982">Mike D of Beastie Boys appeared to reveal that a Frank Ocean and Justice collaboration is on the way</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Beats 1, Mike D explained that he’d heard a couple of “sneak previews” of music the French electronic duo were working on for 2020 whilst he was in Paris with the other members of the group. “They were really, really good,” Mike D added.</p>
      <p>He then added: “There’s a track that’s coming down next year, Frank Ocean and Justice,” Mike D revealed. “It’s wicked,” he joked, in a mock English accent.</p>
