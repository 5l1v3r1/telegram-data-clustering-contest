      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> has found himself in a tricky situation after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-walliams">David Walliams</a> reportedly refused to go his birthday party if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/piers-morgan">Piers Morgan</a> is going to be there.</p>
      <p>The music mogul <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/simon-cowell-postpones-extravagant-60th-20753575">abruptly cancelled</a> his lavish 60th celebrations just days before the bash was due to take place last month and is yet to finalise a new date.</p>
      <p>According to a new report, Simon is now facing a guest list dilemma as well as logistical issues.</p>
      <p>Comedian David, 48, is said to have refused to attend the rearranged party unless Good Morning Britain host Piers' invitation is withdrawn.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10313653/simon-cowell-centre-spat-david-walliams-piers-morgan-60th-birthday/">The Sun</a> : "David refuses to be in the same room as his nemesis, and has told Simon it’s him or Piers.</p>
      <p>"Poor Simon is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Piers and David may be ITV colleagues, but once the cameras stop rolling they cannot abide one another."</p>

      <p>The source compared their feud to "open warfare" and hinted one of the British telly legends might have a meltdown if they both attended Simon's party.</p>
      <p>The insider went on to reveal why the two stars appear to hate one another.</p>
      <p>They said: "David hates Piers’ tabloid newspaper background, and is fairly snobby about it, whilst Piers thinks David is a bit of a duplicitous d**k - nice to his face, and snide behind it."</p>

      <p>Last week claims suggested Simon was forced to postpone the milestone bash due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7627473/Simon-Cowell-CANCELS-60th-birthday-party-leaves-celebrity-pals-plans-chaos.html">Mail Online</a> , the TV star had celebrity guests flying in from all over the world specifically for the party.</p>
      <p>However, Simon and his partner Lauren Silverman sent out cancellations just days before the birthday extravaganza was due to take place.</p>

      <p>Piers and David have been embroiled in a long-running feud for years following a number of public spats.</p>
      <p>Just last month, Piers slammed David online by calling him a "snivelling toady" after the BGT judge liked tweets slating the GMB presenter.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Amusing that @davidwalliams regularly ‘likes’ the nastiest tweets about me, yet is such a snivelling toady to my face."</p>
      <p>Last year the controversial telly host called for the comedian to lose his spot on the BGT panel as he plotted his return after leaving the show in 2011.</p>
      <p>Back in 2017, David refused an interview with Piers for his series Life Stories, opting instead to feature in a sit down chat with John Bishop’s series, A Conversation With.</p>
