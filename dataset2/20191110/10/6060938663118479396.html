      <h1>Kento Momota defends China Open crown for 10th title of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:46:09+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:46</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>SHANGHAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kento-Momota">Kento Momota</a> won his 10th title of a remarkable year as Japan's world number one defeated <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chou-Tien-chen">Chou Tien-chen</a> to retain his Fuzhou <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/China-Open">China Open</a> crown on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Home hope <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chen-Yufei">Chen Yufei</a> similarly successfully defended the women's title with a gritty victory over Japan's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nozomi-Okuhara">Nozomi Okuhara</a>.</p>
      <p>Reigning two-time world champion Momota battled past Taiwan's world number two Chou 21-15, 17-21, 21-18 in a repeat of last year's final.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Chou is in the unusual position of not having a coach and instead relies on his longtime physio to guide him courtside during matches.</p>
      <p>Chou saved one match point but handed Momota the title by hitting into the net. The Japanese player fell onto his back and screamed in celebration, his fists clenched.</p>
      <p>The peerless Momota, 25, has had another hugely successful year, his haul of titles in 2019 including another world crown and the prestigious All England Open.</p>
      <p>The women's final was a similarly gruelling affair and likewise went to three games.</p>
      <p>China's Chen lost the first game 21-9 to Okuhara but recovered to lift the Fuzhou title for the second year in a row by winning the next two 21-12, 21-18.</p>
      <p>It was more disappointment for Okuhara, who has now lost all six finals she has contested this year.</p>
