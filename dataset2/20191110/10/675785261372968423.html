      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: I'm A Celebrity star Caitlyn Jenner has taken the first step towards the rope bridge after jetting into Brisbane this morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:32:31+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has landed Down Under ready to take part in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-2019-line-20835125">I'm A Celebrity</a> .</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashian star, 70, was the second contestant to land in Brisbane Airport for this year's jungle show.</p>
      <p>Asked if she was excited to be taking part in the show, Caitlyn said: “Yeah.”</p>
      <p>But she declined to answer further questions about whether any members of her family would be joining her or if she wanted to win and then got into a waiting car.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, reports said Caitlyn won't be talking about anything her gender reassignment in camp.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn - formerly Olympic gold medallist Bruce Jenner - had gender reassignment surgery in 2017.</p>
      <p>But she says: “It is not something I talk about. Yes, I had gender confirmation and that for me was important.</p>

      <p>"For many trans people it is not important to them. But for me it was.</p>
      <p>"Femininity and womanhood is in your brain and in your soul. That is the issue.</p>
      <p>“It is not what is between your legs. So yes, I had it done. But that is all out of respect to me, my privacy but also respect to the community. It is really not something you talk about.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of taking her flight from LAX airport, Caitlyn admitted that she “doesn't know how I'm A Celebrity works” ahead of her rumoured appearance.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, 70, will earn £500,000 - one of the show's biggest-ever fees for going into the jungle.</p>
