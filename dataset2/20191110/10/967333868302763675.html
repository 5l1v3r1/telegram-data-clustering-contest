      <p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday a new oilfield containing 53 billion barrels of crude had been discovered in the country.</p>
      <p>Hassan Rouhani said that the discovered field was located in Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province.</p>
      <p>The discovery of a new oilfield would boost Iran's proven crude oil reserves by a third. At the moment, Iran has some 150 billion barrels of crude oil reserves.</p>
      <p>In January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) presented a report in which it stated that oil production in Iran, constrained by US sanctions, dropped by 520,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December, down from 2.8 million bpd in October. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201909211076860114-iran-denies-suffering-from-cyber-attack-on-its-oil-sector/">US reinstated energy-related sanctions</a> against Iran last year after withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal, aimed at bringing Iran's oil exports to zero and pressuring it to negotiate a new agreement. Iran has been reluctant to cave in to pressure from the United States and started rolling back some of its nuclear commitments.</p>
      <p>The US sanctions, however – which also discourage foreign companies from doing business with Iran – have prompted the country to search for ways to avoid them, and exporting crude from just outside the Persian Gulf may well be one of them.</p>
