      <h1>Midway review – sinks like a depth charge</h1>

        <i>Impressive aerial battle scenes haven’t a hope of rescuing this jaw-jutting, second world war tosh</i>
      </p>
      <p>The second world war. The US is caught on the back foot after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese are better equipped; the American fighter planes are creaky crates, and their torpedoes have all the destructive power of conkers. But, as this macho war wank from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/roland-emmerich">Roland Emmerich</a> argues, the US had one thing in its favour: its men. All the most enormous, jutting, chiselled chins in Hollywood are called up to do their duty, and armed with lines of dialogue that sink like depth charges.</p>
      <p>In fairness, the screenplay, by Wes Tooke, was never intended to be the main attraction here; the priorities in this account of the Battle of Midway are the admittedly impressive aerial battle sequences, featuring numerous gut-churning plunges as the US pilots dive-bomb the enemy ships.</p>
      <p>British actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/28/deadpool-star-ed-skrein-quits-hellboy-reboot">Ed Skrein</a> stars as the most reckless of all the flyboys, Dick Best; Woody Harrelson dons a silver wig and an expression of noble fortitude as Admiral Chester Nimitz. Every tired war movie cliche is unearthed in a film that brings nothing new but will no doubt please fans of men in uniform yelling at explosions.</p>
