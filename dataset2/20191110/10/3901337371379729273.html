      <p>Orlando Pirates’ interim head coach, Rulani Mokwena felt that more than one Kaizer Chiefs player should have gotten a red card yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Buccaneers suffered a 3-2 defeat to Amakhosi in a thrilling Soweto derby showdown at the FNB Stadium, where in added time, Eric Mathoho was given marching orders after a red card booking.</p>

      <p>However, speaking to the media after the game, Mokwena expressed how he felt that Chiefs’ ‘thuggish’ behaviour should have seen more than just ‘Tower’ exit the field.</p>
      <p>“I hear Coach (Ernst) Middendorp saying that he doesn’t know what happened with the red card, I watched it again and it is just not just Mathoho that should have been sent off, it is real thuggish behaviour, it doesn’t belong on the pitch, it is very bad for football,” Mokwena said.</p>
      <p>“It starts with Katsande’s tackle on Fortune Makaringe in the first half, over the top, career threatening tackle and thuggish as well. Those are the situations that I am talking about, those things does not belong in South African football.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a player bleeding now with a broken nose because he was punched in the face, Kaizer Chiefs is good enough to beat us on tactics, on personnel, (they are a) well coached team - excellent, but not on diving inside, Parker’s excellent dive, not on thuggish tackles and not on boxing, we don’t train boxing,” he added.</p>
