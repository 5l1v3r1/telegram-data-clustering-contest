      <h1>A car accident at 17 saved my life: Jameela Jamil</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:45:56+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>British actor-activist Jameela Jamil has opened up about how a “very intense” car accident had a roundabout way of saving her life.</p>
      <p><i>The Good Place</i> actor was 17 at the time and embroiled in the modeling industry she now speaks out against for promoting a life of disordered eating habits from a young age, reported <i><a href="https://www.instyle.com/syndication/the-good-places-jameela-jamil-explains-how-a-car-accident-at-age-17-saved-her-life">InStyle</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“I only modeled for a while and then I got hit by a car and ended up in a wheelchair, which probably actually saved my life,” the 33-year old told <i>Cosmopolitan</i>. “Otherwise, I would probably still be a model with an eating disorder.</p>

      <p>Jamil said that as a teenager in the business, she was instructed by agents and other models to smoke and engage in unhealthy practices to maintain an unrealistic physique.</p>
      <p>“I was encouraged to only eat red peppers or take a small bag of sweetener around with me so that whenever I felt like I was gonna faint, I would just have a little bit of sugar rather than eat any full meals,” she recalled.</p>

      <p>Then, when she was involved in the car accident that “destroyed” her back — she was bedridden for about a year and used a wheelchair for six more months — she was forced to reassess her health.</p>
      <p>“At that point, I had gained about 70 pounds on steroids, so I was ‘too big’ for modeling,” said Jamil, now thankful for the career-halting incident. “I also developed a sense of purpose to protect my body after that and stop starving myself.”</p>

      <p>She added, “I still had an eating disorder mentality, but I stopped actively starving myself once I got better because I realized that my body was fragile and I was taking it for granted.”</p>
      <p>Jamil now is an advocate of body neutrality or body liberation, as opposed to body positivity. When she stopped by <i>The Daily Show with Trevor Noah</i> in October, she said that movement was “not for me” because of its inherent discrimination based on size.</p>
      <p>“I believe in just not thinking about your body, and I have the luxury of being able to do that because I’m not being constantly persecuted for my size,” she explained.</p>
