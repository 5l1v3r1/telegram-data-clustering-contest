      <p>MILAN: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nicolo-Barella">Nicolo Barella</a> scored his first league goal for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Inter-Milan">Inter Milan</a> in a 2-1 win over <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Verona">Verona</a> which put <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Antonio-Conte">Antonio Conte</a>'s side top of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Serie-A">Serie A</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former Cagliari forward's curling effort seven minutes from time allowed Inter to overtake defending champions Juventus.</p>
      <p>Inter have 31 points from 12 games, two points ahead of Juve, who host 13th-placed AC Milan in Turin on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Conte had been furious after his side threw away a two-goal lead to fall to a 3-2 Champions League defeat to Borussia Dortmund in Germany midweek.</p>
      <p>And they got off to the worst possible start when Valerio Verre put Verona ahead from the spot on 19 mintues afer Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic tripped Mattia Zaccagni.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Marco Silvestri and the Verona defence held off Inter at the San Siro before Matias Vecino broke through sending in off a Valentino Lazaro cross on 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>But Barella grabbed the winner with a superb curling effort on 83 minutes whipping off his jersey as he celebrated wildly with his teammates.</p>
      <p>It was his second goal since joining Inter last summer having scored the equaliser in a 1-1 Champions League draw to Slavia Prague as Verona drop to ninth place with the defeat.</p>
      <p>Later, Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli, in seventh after three league defeants without a win, host 17th-placed Genoa.</p>
      <p>In Turin, Andrea Belotti converted a pair of penalties with Alex Berenguer bagging a brace of his own to get Torino back to winning ways with a 4-0 romp over ten-man Brescia.</p>
      <p>Torino snapped their six-match winless run and inflicted a first defeat on new Brescia coach Fabio Grosso whose side are second from bottom in the Serie A table.</p>
      <p>Belotti got Torino off the mark after 17 minutes with a penalty awarded after a Simone Verdi free kick bounced off Brescia defender Andrea Cistana's arm.</p>
      <p>The second came on 26 minutes when Czech defender Ales Mateju was deemed to have used his arm to block a Belotti shot on goal after a VAR review.</p>
      <p>Belotti again slotted in to bring his tally to seven Serie A goals this season.</p>
      <p>Brescia were reduced to ten men before the break when Mateju was sent off for a second yellow card for fouling Belotti.</p>
      <p>A man down, Grosso substituted Brescia forward Mario Balotelli by defender Bruno Martella after the break.</p>
      <p>Jesse Joronen denied Belotti a hat-trick before Berenguer broke through and fired past the Finnish keeper on 75 minutes.</p>
      <p>And five minutes later Berenguer added a third when he picked up a Diego Laxalt cross to slot in his second goal this season.</p>
      <p>Brescia, with a game in hand, fell to their fourth consecutive defeat with their winless run now stretching back seven games.</p>
      <p>Torino's first win since September 26 puts them 11th with 14 points from 12 games.</p>
