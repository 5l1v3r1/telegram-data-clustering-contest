      <p>A photograph of Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg having a bite of a cinnamon roll at Ruby’s Restaurant went viral on Twitter as users thought at first that he was eating ‘a chicken wing’.</p>
      <p>Twitterians widely ridiculed and made fun of the photo, reposting earlier photographs in which the candidate <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908151076553911-us-dem-candidate-buttigieg-helped-create-phone-alert-to-warn-about-ice-raids--report/">appeared to be eating and drinking</a> in “funny manners”.</p>

      <p>Some Twitter users argued that Buttigieg’s eligibility to be a US president and run the country would be diminished if he “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911081077260125-trump-says-democratic-presidential-hopeful-bloomberg-will-fail-in-2020-election/">can’t eat a cinnamon roll</a>.”</p>
      <p>Lis Smith, Buttigieg’s senior advisor, wrote “these are actually chicken wings” adding a photo of two trays of chicken wings.</p>

      <p>The purported food gaffe bears a striking similarity to the outcry against current US President Donald Trump who, in 2011, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911021077203965-democratic-candidate-beto-orourke-announces-withdrawal-from-us-presidential-race/">was seen in the company</a> of former US vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, oddly eating a piece of regular cheese pizza with a fork and knife.</p>

      <p>​"I don't even understand how biting into a tiny piece of soft pastry could possibly require...two hands? and that... face?," said someone.</p>
