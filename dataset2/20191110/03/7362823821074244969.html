      <h1>MLB star Todd Frazier calls out Dem governor as wild turkeys invade NJ neighborhood</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T03:59:34+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 03:59</time> by <a rel="author">Dom Calicchio</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb">MLB</a> star Todd Frazier went to bat for his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> neighbors Saturday, calling out Democratic <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/governors">Gov</a>. Phil Murphy over the problem of aggressive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature">wild turkeys</a> invading Frazier’s hometown.</p>
      <p>“Animal control needs to step up and move these animals ASAP,” Frazier wrote in a Twitter message directed at Murphy. “State wildlife control needs to figure it out. What’s it going to take?”</p>

      <p>Minutes earlier, Frazier described how the problem has affected him and people he knows in Toms River, where Frazier played for the team that won the Little League World Series in 1998.</p>

      <p>“They are a big problem here,” wrote Frazier, who has played for the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/cincinnati-reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/chicago-white-sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-yankees">New York Yankees</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-mets">New York Mets</a>. “Toms River and the Toms River wildlife say they can’t move them. That’s ridiculous.</p>
      <p>“They have come close to harming my family and friends, ruined my cars, trashed my yard and much more.”</p>

      <p>“The turkeys are taking over,” one resident told <a href="http://newjersey.news12.com/story/41291732/they-go-to-attack-you-aggressive-gaggle-of-wild-turkeys-terrorize-55andup-community">News 12 New Jersey</a>. “It’s like an infestation."</p>
      <p>But despite fielding numerous complaints, personnel at the local animal control office said they can't do anything about the turkeys due to state regulations.</p>

      <p>“It's nuisance wildlife,” Toms River Animal Control’s Richard Barbosa <a href="https://abc7ny.com/pets-animals/wild-turkeys-terrorizing-new-jersey-neighborhood-residents-say/5684163/">told WABC-TV of New York City</a>. “We are not licensed to trap, relocate or, as they use the word, harass the turkeys -- or any wildlife, for that matter, that's a nuisance.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the state's Department of Environmental Protection told the Associated Press the agency was aware of the issue but does not have further comment.</p>
