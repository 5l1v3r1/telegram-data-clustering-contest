      <p>LOURDS, France:Â French bishops on Saturday (Nov 9) approved a programme of payouts to victims of sex abuse by priests - but survivors have already objected that the Church has not gone far enough in admitting responsibility.</p>
      <p>Voting at the bi-annual Conference of French Bishops (CEF) in the southern city of Lourdes, a large majority of the 120 bishops approved the payments to those who had suffered abuse within the Church.</p>

      <p>The size of the payouts will be made will be determined at a meeting in April, conference chairman Eric de Moulins-Beaufort, the archbishop of Reims, told reporters.</p>
      <p>A source at the CEF said the sums being discussed were in the thousands of euros.</p>
      <p>They would prioritise paying victims of abuse where the offences happened too long ago to be prosecuted. Victims whose cases could still be prosecuted would receive payments at a later date.</p>
      <p>Those paying into the fund would be bishops, any members of the Church who wanted to contribute -- and those priests, still alive, who had committed the abuse.</p>
      <p>But any money paid was designed neither as compensation that would be determined by a court "or by canonical justice", nor as reparation, said Moulins-Beaufort</p>
      <p>But some victims said this did not go far enough.</p>
      <p>"The word 'responsibility' of the Church does not appear, that really bothers me," said Jean-Luc Souveton, a priest and a member of the working group on the issue, who was himself abused by a priest when a child.</p>
      <p>Michel, another priest who was also a victim but who did not want to give his full name, agreed with Souveton that the statement was not enough.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'NEGLIGENCE, INDIFFERENCE'</b>
      </p>
      <p>But De Moulins-Beaufort, who is Archbishop of Reims, did acknowledge the "silence, negligence, indifference, an absence of reaction, bad decisions or dysfunctionality at the heart of the Church".</p>
      <p>An independent commission set up by the Church to investigate the scandal started work in June.</p>
      <p>Committee chairman Jean-Marc Sauve told AFP in September that they had received about 2,000 messages in its first three months.</p>
      <p>Most of those who had come forward were older then 50, and two-thirds were men, he added. The committee is looking at allegations dating as far back as the 1950s.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, another victim of abuse, Olivier Savignac, objected that the bishops had not waited for the findings of the independent commission.</p>
      <p>"The bishops are getting around the recommendations of the ... commission so they don't have to face up to what is going to be a tsunami" of complaints, he said.</p>
      <p>In May, Pope Francis passed a landmark new measure obliging anyone in the Church who knew about sex abuse to report it to their superiors.</p>
      <p>A few months earlier, a French cardinal, Philippe Barbarin, received a six-month suspended jail sentence for failing to report sex abuse by a priest under his authority. His case is up for appeal later this month.</p>
      <p>In August, the Vatican's former number three, Australian Cardinal George Pell, lost his appeal against his conviction for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys at a Melbourne cathedral in the 1990s.</p>
