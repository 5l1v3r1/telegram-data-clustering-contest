      <h1>ISL: ATK beat Jamshedpur FC 3-1 to go top of table</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T03:05:52+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 03:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Aritra-Chowdhury-479248777.cms" target="_blank">Aritra Chowdhury</a></address>
      <p><b>KOLKATA:</b> Striker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roy-Krishna">Roy Krishna</a> converted two second-half penalties as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/atl%C3%A9tico-de-kolkata">ATK</a> edged past <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jamshedpur-ISL-team">Jamshedpur FC</a> 3-1 in their ISL-6 match at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salt-Lake-Stadium">Salt Lake Stadium</a> here on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After a barren first half, Krishna broke the deadlock in the 57th minute, followed by his second in the 71st. Substitute Edu Garcia (90+1) scored the team's third. For Jamshedpur, Sergio Castel pulled one back in the 87th minute.</p>
      <p>The third win on the trot helped Antonio Lopez Habas' men climb to the top of the table with nine points from four games. On the other hand, Jamshedpur, after their first loss of the season, are in fourth spot with seven points from as many games.</p>
      <p>Despite rain pouring down, both the teams started the match on a positive note.</p>
      <p>The first chance came for the away side after eight minutes when Francisco Medina's fine cross from the left found Farukh Choudhary. But the forward headed the ball straight into the crossbar, spurning an easy chance.</p>
      <p>From there on, both the teams held on to go into the break goalless.</p>
      <p>The second half began with both teams pressing forward in search of the lead.</p>
      <p>It was the home side that was rewarded for its positive intent. The combination of Roy, David Wiliiams and Soosai Raj made the difference for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes into the half, Roy made a surging run from the middle past a couple of Jamshedpur defenders but was brought down by Luis Espinosa inside the box. The referee did not hesitate in pointing to the spot and the Fijian forward easily slotted home past goalkeeper Subrata Pal.</p>
      <p>Roy continued to trouble the Jamshedpur defence.</p>
      <p>He won another penalty soon after when Medina brought down the striker inside the box. Roy completed the formalities to net his third of the season.</p>
      <p>As ATK looked set to run away with a comfortable win, Jamshedpur won a penalty in the 85th minute after a tough challenge on Noe Acosta by Anas Edathodika. Castel made it 2-1 with a calm finish.</p>
      <p>As the game entered its final minutes, Habas handed Jobby Justin his debut. The former East Bengal star, who missed the first three games due to suspension, got some time on the field.</p>
      <p>A minute into the added-on time, Spaniard Garcia consolidated for the hosts with a fine finish.</p>
      <p>ATK will take on Odisha FC on November 24 in an away tie while Jamshedpur will be up against FC Goa two days later.</p>
