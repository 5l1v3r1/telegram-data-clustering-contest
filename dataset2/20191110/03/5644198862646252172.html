      <p>NEW YORK:Â New York City FC, which had the second-best record in Major League Soccer this year, has parted ways with coach Domenec Torrent, a former assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The team announced the amicable split with the 57-year-old Spaniard and his staff on Friday (Nov 8), a little more than two weeks after NYCFC, which topped the Eastern Conference with 64 points, was ousted by Toronto in the MLS playoffs.</p>

      <p>Torrent replaced Patrick Vieira in June 2018 as coach of NYCFC.</p>
      <p>"This is the right time for myself and my family to look for other opportunities as I develop my career as a head coach," Torrent said.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank NYCFC for giving me this opportunity. I've learned a lot during my time at the club."</p>
      <p>NYCFC Vice Chairman Marty Edelman said the timing also worked for the team.</p>
      <p>"In discussions with Dome since our season finished, we've decided that this is the right moment for both parties to focus on new opportunities," Edelman said.</p>
