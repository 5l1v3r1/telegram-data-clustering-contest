      <p>A toddler was left fighting for his life after he snagged a vegetable steamer and it poured nine litres of boiling water all over his body.</p>
      <p>Dougie Dodd suffered third-degree burns to his face, neck, chest, hands and feet following the horrific accident.</p>
      <p>The tot, who was one at the time, was in hospital for two months fighting toxic shock syndrome - a potentially fatal condition caused by an infection.</p>
      <p>Mum Nadia Hulse, 25, recalled the incident that happened in March and told of the horror that left her heartbroken.</p>
      <p>She was cooking and on a video chat with her mother while little Dougie was playing with saucepans on the kitchen floor.</p>

      <p>He was also holding a spoon as he reached up towards the steamer that contained nine litres of boiling water and vegetables.</p>
      <p>Nadia, from Cannock, Staffordshire, said: "I was right next to Dougie when it happened. I shouted, 'Dougie, no!' which startled him.</p>
      <p>"As he jumped back the handle of the spoon got caught on the wire and the vegetable steamer tipped over.</p>
      <p>"I stripped Dougie and raced him upstairs into a cold bath but he was screaming hysterically and trying to out of the bath and on to me."</p>

      <p>Nadia's mum called an ambulance after watching the incident unfold on FaceTime.</p>
      <p>Doughie was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital with burns covering half of his body.</p>
      <p>"He was touch-and-go in the hospital at one point and I couldn't stop crying. I was an absolute mess," she said.</p>
      <p>Receptionist Nadia was told her son had to undergo skin grafting where doctors took skin from Dougie's thigh to cover his left wrist and chest.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't the end of Dougie's harrowing ordeal.</p>
      <p>On 14 March, doctors diagnosed toxic shock syndrome – a potentially fatal condition caused by an infection.</p>

      <p>Dougie’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ten-ways-banish-high-blood-9621402">blood pressure</a> soared and he needed an oxygen mask to breathe. Doctors were then forced to administer a blood plasma transfusion.</p>
      <p>But the brave boy fought back and within hours of the transfusion he was showing signs of recovery.</p>
      <p>He was finally discharged on April 8.</p>
      <p>Seven months later Dougie, now two, still wears a compression vest at night to try to reduce scarring.</p>

      <p>Nadia said: "Dougie is such a happy, lively little boy and has not changed his outgoing personality one bit.</p>
      <p>"But I still feel guilt. I know it was a freak accident and the only thing I could have done differently was not let him play with the saucepans.</p>
      <p>"I worry about him growing up with his scars but will constantly reassure him every day of how brave he was and how beautiful he is with his scars."</p>
