      <p>In support of the Duterte administration’s goal to decentralize the economic activities from “imperial” Metro Manila to the countryside, the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP) is aligning with the government and its initiatives for inclusive growth, security and rural development. </p>
      <p>Newly elected LMP President Luis “Chavit” Singson vowed on Wednesday to strengthen the league’s relationship with the Office of the President, as well as the Senate and Congress, in order to make their programs at synch with the national level.</p>
      <p>He also made a commitment to back up the Chief Executive’s 10-point socioeconomic agenda and other notable efforts, including local governance reforms, achieving lasting peace in Mindanao and the fight against corruption, crimes and illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>“[We] will work as one team to achieve our goals,” Singson said during the LMP National Directorate Meeting at the New World Hotel in Makati City.</p>
      <h3>Quality service</h3>
      <p>For the first time in LMP history, the mayor of Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, has made an unprecedented record being a candidate for the top position that faced no challenger from the 81 provincial chapter presidents representing the country’s more than 1,400 municipal mayors.</p>
      <p>Elated by this rare show of unity among his colleagues that led to his unopposed election, Singson dedicated an honest-to-goodness leadership to all members of the league.</p>
      <p>“[The] overwhelming trust and confidence of my fellow mayors…will all the more spur me to deliver the best services to all our municipalities all over the country,” he said upon taking his oath of office. “So expect transparency, accountability and legality in my service.” </p>
      <p>Vision veering away from the traditional way of governance, especially in rural areas, the LMP president shared his vision to make the municipal local government units (LGUs) “innovative and enterprising.”</p>
      <p>He advised the town executives not to be “too dependent” on their internal revenue allotments (IRA) to bankroll their development projects in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>To do so, they “have to learn how to harness the corporate powers and abilities of our LGUs in the delivery of basic services,” according to him. </p>
      <h3>Connecting Filipinos with govt</h3>
      <p>With his intention to bring the government closer to the people, the mayor revealed several priority projects that he wants to accomplish during his three-year term of leading the league, foremost of which is a state-of-the-art connectivity linking all municipalities through public Wi-fi that his company would provide for free.</p>
      <p>The Luis Chavit Singson (LCS) Group comprises a diverse array of companies, one of which is Gracia Telecom that caters to customers in his stronghold in Ilocos Sur. </p>
      <p>“This way, even far-flung towns will have direct connection with national government agencies and easy access to information and data from all over the world,” Singson said of his  firm that banded together with Mindanao-based Internet provider TierOne Communications in an attempt to be the third-biggest telecommunications firm in the country.</p>
      <p>Such ambitious project, he bared, will immediately start initially in the areas of all the provincial chapter presidents. </p>
      <p>“Then, they will help us later on to mobilize this to other municipalities nationwide until all will have a free Wi-fi,” he told reporters in mixed Filipino and English after their meeting and election of a new set of league officers.</p>
      <p>The former Ilocos Sur governor, likewise, asked further assistance from the municipal mayors to recommend ideal sites for the common telco towers that the government is eyeing to put up for use of all the telco players.</p>
      <h3>Other plans, initiatives</h3>
      <p>Bringing with him his experience in leading the Philippine Councilors League (PCL), Singson intends to enhance his colleague’s masteral of local governance with continuous education.</p>
      <p>As regards to their environmental thrust, Singson said he will push for a waste-to-energy program to help the town executives to manage their garbage problems in an ecological and sustainable manner.</p>
      <p>Through the help of his renewable-energy company, he offered to provide their solutions to several places in the provinces to convert the collected garbages into a clean source of power. </p>
      <p>The Narvacan mayor also showed his concern to the safety of his counterparts given the recent spate of killings victimizing some local executives.</p>
      <p>“Probably in our upcoming meetings, we will call our law-enforcement agencies, not only the police but also the military, to get their recommendations on how to solve this issue,” he said. “To avoid such crimes committed against our mayors, we need a continuous policing, especially on crowded places. The most important thing to do is intelligence.”</p>
      <p>Singson rises to the LMP presidency as a seasoned political leader with more than 30 years of experience in various capacities as Ilocos Sur governor, first district congressman, Vigan City councilor and Narvacan municipal councilor.</p>
