      <p><i>Destiny 2</i> killed off <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2019/02/04/what-is-so-complicated-about-trials-returning-to-destiny-2/#6c42827c39ba">Trials of the Nine over a year ago</a>, and the mode hasn’t returned the game since. When it <i>does</i> return, the heavy implication has been that it will revert back to its <i>Destiny 1</i> concept, Trials of Osiris, which was a more beloved version of the mode.Much has changed since Trials left. The game has already gone back to making dual primaries optional instead of mandatory. It’s also made 3v3 standard in competitive play. The road is paved for a return, but now fans are simply wondering…when.</p>
      <p>I think there are quite a few clues that Trials may return as soon as next season, though it’s not exactly a guarantee at this point. Some have to do with the mode itself, others with the namesake of the mode, Osiris.</p>
      <p>Fans are not terribly amused with how the character of Osiris has been handled in <i>Destiny 2</i> so far, as he was the star of the game’s worst DLC, Curse of Osiris, and had nothing to do with D2 Trials. And yet I have to believe that we have not seen the last of him, and signs are pointing to a possible return for him in the story very, very soon. And if Osiris comes back, so should his trials.</p>
      <p>So, where are we?</p>
      <p>We are currently barreling toward the grand conclusion of Season of the Undying. The Triangle Darkness people are throwing waves of Vex at is with the Vex Invasion/Offensive, and we are about to put a stop to it after building a Vex portal in the Tower and killing the Undying Mind in so many parallel timelines he stays dead for good.</p>

      <p>When you have a storyline that includes Ikora, the Vex and multiple timelines and realities, it certainly seems like Osiris should end up being part of the equation, given his involvement with all three of those things. The idea is that this season could end with Osiris returning to the game’s story in some capacity, and there are also hints that his protégé Saint-14 may return as well, as he’s listed as having a voice actor for this season, and there are long-running theories that he’s not dead, just in stasis.</p>
      <p>That’s present day, but fans are also drawing on the future. According to glimpses of whiteboards in Bungie Vidocs, one working title for next season is Season of the Dawn, and the implication there is Dawn = Sun = Mercury = Osiris. There’s also a note about “fixing the timeline,” which would seem to be Osiris’s specialty, with the idea that we are probably going to screw something up with this portal, the Undying Mind and Ikora’s plans. And perhaps Osiris will be there to help us fix it (while being as condescending as possible).</p>
      <p>And then there’s the actual mode itself. Bungie has been testing a bunch of different variants of Elimination, the core Trials mode, all season long where the aim is no doubt to pick the best one and make that…Trials. This has not been some covert test, it’s been out in the open, and it’s very, very clear its express purpose is to playtest Trials ahead of Trials actually returning.</p>

      <p>It may seem a <i>bit</i> sudden to just pick a mode and run with it for a season that is probably just a month or so away, and yet all these clues would lead me to believe that this will indeed happen next season. If not, I would almost <i>guarantee</i> the season after, though I think there are just too many Osiris clues here for this not to be happening next season. There is the ongoing problem of cheating, however, which is especially rampant on PC after the switch to Steam, and would absolutely decimate the return of Trials if not fixed before its launched.</p>
      <p>This raises another question about what a season based around the return of Trials would be like, given that it’s a pinnacle PvP activity, more so than even Iron Banner, and it would be tough to root an entire season around it, no matter how loud the cries have been for its return. But that’s a debate for another day.</p>
      <p>I really do believe that Trials is coming back next season with at least 80% certainty. Okay maybe 70%. 65. The mode is tested, the story beats are coming together, and now we just have to see what Bungie has planned, and who will volunteer to carry me to flawless this time.</p>
