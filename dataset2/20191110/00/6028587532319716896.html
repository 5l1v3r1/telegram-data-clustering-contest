      <p>It’s an awkward moment for Bethesda’s <i>Fallout</i> series. This autumn was supposed to be <i>Fallout 76</i>’s big triumph—a free large-scale story expansion, seasonal events, new frequently requested features. But many of the game’s core players aren’t happy with recent developments, from the <i>Wastelanders</i> update getting pushed back to 2020 to the rocky launch of the controversial <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch">Fallout 1st subscription program</a>.On October 17, players learned that <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more"><i>Wastelanders</i></a>, originally announced for a fall 2019 release, would launch sometime early next year. Just six days later, Bethesda detailed its plans for a new premium subscription service that gives users access to “private worlds” (limited to eight players instead of the usual 24), a handful of exclusive digital goods for use in-game, and 1,650 “Atoms,” the game’s virtual currency. Some players saw this as a betrayal, some felt a great sense of disappointment, and others simply saw it as a fair and natural step in the game’s transition from a new release to something more akin to Rockstar’s unstoppable cash cow, <i>Grand Theft Auto Online</i>. Make no mistake, however: Consumers who regularly play games would <i>never</i> mistake <i>Fallout 76</i> for <i>GTA Online</i>.</p>
      <p>It’s a shame that <i>76</i> has had so many issues as a product, because its game world is inspired and lovely, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkane/2019/10/18/halloweentime-in-appalachia/">its player community</a> is nothing short of astounding. It’s had every reason to become a major competitor in the rapidly growing “live-service” games market. And yet it’s suffered <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/7/18214008/fallout-76-updates-patch-fix-future">one disaster after the next</a>. It’s rewarded endgame raiders with <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-player-completes-new-raid-earns-useless-dri-1837457053">useless power tools</a> instead of weapons; its Fallout 1st perks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/">haven’t worked as advertised</a>; players are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50182885">protesting against the game</a> and engaging in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/6/20950122/fallout-76-apocalyptic-aristocracy-peasants-class-war-bethesda-subscription-1st">class warfare</a>. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/zenimax-to-refund-consumers-for-the-fallout-76-game">recently ruled</a> that Australian gamers who requested refunds for the software between November 24, 2018, and June 1, 2019, would receive them.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, the new <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i> is ranked sixth for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory">viewership on Twitch</a>, <i>Fortnite</i> is ranked eighth, <i>GTA Online</i> is ranked twelfth, and <i>Fallout 76</i> doesn’t even crack the top 100. <i>Skyrim</i>, a Bethesda title released in 2011, currently has more viewers. These numbers fluctuate often based on scheduled events and individual streamers’ whims, but they also paint a solid picture of games’ cultural relevance.</p>
      <p>During an <a href="https://youtu.be/PPWDwBrUNyY?t=1031">E3 2018 interview</a> with Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley, studio director Todd Howard outlined some of Bethesda Game Studios’ vision for <i>76</i>, including the Fallout 1st service. “Once we find out here’s what the players like, or here’s what they’re missing and they want—since we’ve built a system—our plan is to be adding into the game constantly, tweaking it, and have that long-term interaction with all of our fans,” Howard said. “We love mods, and so we are one hundred percent committed to doing that in <i>76</i> as well. We will not be able to do that at launch, though.”</p>
      <p>He added, “We’re currently still designing what that service looks like. You’ll be able to have your own private world, and be able to mod it and do all of that.” Perhaps wisely, he didn’t mention price at the time. Fast-forward to fall of 2019, and private worlds are finally available as part of the Fallout 1st program—which costs U.S. consumers $12.99 a month, or $99.99 annually.</p>

      <p>“People are so hyped up on the cost of it,” says Kim Campbell, a 48-year-old paramedic who plays the game on an almost daily basis. “But I spent probably more than twenty bucks a month on Atoms. More than I care to admit. Because they do that update every Tuesday or Wednesday, and they have all this cool stuff in there. Now, I’ll grind out for some Atoms, like everybody else, but sometimes it’s just not enough. Or, because of my work schedule and stuff like that, I don’t have time.”</p>
      <p>For a player as dedicated as Campbell, a subscription model makes sense. “With Fallout 1st—look, I get a private server, I get the exclusive outfits, and sixteen hundred Atoms a month. For less than what I’d normally pay for Atoms. People are like, ‘<i>Fortnite</i>’s free.’ Yes, it is. <i>Battle Royale</i> is. But I’ve also seen people—my coworkers—drop a hundred bucks on <a href="https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/V-Bucks">V-Bucks</a> <i>in one sitting</i>. For skins.”</p>
      <p>This phenomenon isn’t new or surprising; frequent big spenders, known within the industry as “whales,” are the ones <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/2/26/11623998/a-long-tail-of-whales-half-of-mobile-games-money-comes-from-0-15">shelling out most of the money</a> on in-game purchases—despite representing only a tiny percentage of players.</p>
      <p>“I think we can all agree that a large portion of the community was just not happy, but from my perspective, I was noticing that a lot of people weren’t really clear about what was happening,” says Dom Retana, a 37-year-old system administrator who worked as a tester at Bethesda several years back. (He’s credited on 2014’s <i>Wolfenstein: The New Order</i>.) “When I saw the news, I was like, ‘Okay, this is cool; this is something we’ve been <i>waiting</i> for. Everybody wanted private servers, just to either enjoy a single-player perspective or get away from the griefers and whatnot.’”</p>
      <p>“We knew private servers were coming, and we knew that they were going to cost something,” Campbell says. “People were speculating on how much it was gonna cost—some people were saying fifteen dollars a month. People knew that they were going to have to pay for it before it came out. So that’s what surprised <i>me</i>. ‘Wait, wait, wait. Why is everybody acting so surprised?’”</p>
      <p>“When I saw that there was a subscription for it, I understood, fully, that it was specifically for the servers,” says Retana. “Yeah, you are getting certain buffs with it—the monthly Atom allowance, the cosmetics, and all that stuff. But I was okay with it because I understood it: you’re paying for a service that’s being run on their hardware and being maintained by them.”</p>
      <p>Despite being a dedicated <i>Fallout 76</i> player, Retana hasn’t subscribed to the service thus far, but he feels the price point is reasonable. “I’m also coming from a standpoint of being a pretty big <i>Minecraft</i> player,” he says, “and I’ve seen prices for <i>Minecraft</i> servers. And those range anywhere from six dollars to thirty or even more, sometimes. And that just depends on the type of hardware you’re trying to get behind these servers. It’s not overly expensive, but it’s not cheap either.”</p>
      <p>Other <i>Fallout</i> players spoke less kindly of Bethesda’s new offering.</p>

      <p>“Fallout 1st was a huge slap in the face,” says Chandler Jordan, 19, who works at a department store in California. “Anybody who’s paying for it is not only buying into a system designed to screw them over; they’re supporting a game that doesn’t even fundamentally function.”</p>
      <p>“I pre-ordered the <a href="https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76#Editions">Tricentennial Edition</a> the day it was announced,” says Ethan, a 20-year-old marketing researcher from San Diego. “I was an avid member of the <i>Fallout</i> community and even defended the game relentlessly while simultaneously being frustrated with the game for the first three weeks. I stopped playing the game altogether after about three months.” He says he’s talked at least four of his friends out of “falling victim” to the Fallout 1st “trap.”</p>
      <p>“Private servers and mods were promised to us pre-launch,” says Dylen, a 26-year-old cook from Maryland. “Now, it seems like, yeah, it’s <i>coming</i>, but we’ll have to subscribe for them. Which I imagine will also put off <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4">the modders themselves</a> from making mods for the game. I don’t like how they’re taking promised features and player ideas and selling them to us, like, ‘But you guys wanted these things.’”</p>
      <p>“I do think <i>Fallout 76</i> had something to offer as a multiplayer game, but Bethesda keeps changing things that make it harder for the fans to play the way they want,” says Emily King, a thirtysomething nurse from Texas. “Right before the release of Fallout 1st—and what should have been the much-anticipated <i>Wastelanders</i>—they got rid of the Survival mode, where PvP players could play a more [aggressive] style. So the Survival players came back to Adventure, where farmer characters work cooperatively, and caused trouble. Then they release these ‘private worlds,’ and the farmers felt obligated to get to get away from the Survival players. Bethesda forced the conflict, then made you pay to get out of it.”</p>
      <p>For Samantha Terry, a 30-year-old mother from Bristol, Virginia, there’s a less obvious benefit to private servers: sanctuary for players with disabilities such as adult ADHD, anxiety, or depressive disorders.</p>
      <p>“I, personally, am happy with Fallout 1st,” Terry tells me. “I’m able to add six or seven of my friends, and we can let loose and not be afraid of trolls. I like that I can make it to where it’s sensory-friendly for those who may have anxiety and things associated with that; I like the peaceful environment I can create with it. Bethesda games have always been a calm in the storms I’ve faced, and Fallout 1st allows me, as the player, to enjoy the multiplayer experience stress-free. Everyone faces something different in life, and I think there’s something in the private servers for everyone’s needs.”</p>
      <p>“I work thirty-six hours straight, and then I’ll come home and have like two and a half days off. But I can play <i>Fallout</i> at work,” Kim Campbell says of her job as a paramedic. “Our chief lets us bring our gaming consoles to work. Because our job is <i>stressful</i>, and this is my outlet. It’s always been my outlet; I’ve been playing since Atari. That’s another thing—with the private servers, sometimes I just wanna be alone, you know? And so that’s where I go. Games have been my escape, my therapy, and sometimes I just wanna be by myself and explore the world by myself, as if I was playing <i>Fallout 4</i>.”</p>
