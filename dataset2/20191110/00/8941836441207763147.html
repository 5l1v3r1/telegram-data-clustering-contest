      <p>ST. LOUIS (AP) - Some Missouri business owners looking to profit from the state’s burgeoning marijuana industry worry they’re at a disadvantage to established out-of-state organizations that have been aggressive in applying to process or sell medical marijuana in Missouri.</p>
      <p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that nearly 700 groups have filed more than 2,000 marijuana business applications in the state. That comes after voters approved a measure last year to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes in Missouri.</p>
      <p>Missouri will issue only 60 licenses to grow marijuana, 86 to make marijuana-infused products and 192 to open dispensaries.</p>
      <p>Simply applying is expensive: $6,000 for each dispensary or processing license and $10,000 per cultivation license. The most licenses any one business can win is 11.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>At least 21 groups, most of them marijuana retailers from other states, have applied for 11 or more licenses.</p>
