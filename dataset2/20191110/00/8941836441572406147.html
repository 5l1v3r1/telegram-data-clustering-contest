      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - President Donald Trump’s former U.N. ambassador, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Nikki Haley</a> , alleges in her upcoming memoir that two top administration officials tried to enlist her in opposing some of Trump’s policies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> writes that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-White House chief of staff John Kelly were following a “dangerous path.”</p>
      <p>In her book, “With All Due Respect,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> describes a meeting with Tillerson and Kelly, both of whom had differed with Trump on pulling out of the Paris climate accords and other decisions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> writes that Tillerson and Kelly believed they were trying to “save the country,” but she remembers thinking they were only trying to impose their own beliefs.</p>
      <p>“I was shocked,” she writes.</p>
