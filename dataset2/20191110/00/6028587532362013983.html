      <h1>Are Your Surveys Aligned To Your Customer’s Journey?</h1>

      <p>Recently I took a flight from London to the US for work. Before getting to the airport, I made sure I had checked in online and had my boarding pass available on my phone. So, on arrival at the airport, the only thing I had to do before going through security was to have my passport and visa status checked by the airline staff that I was flying with. Having done that, I then headed through security and Duty-Free into the departures area.</p>
      <p>On arriving there, I was then surprised to receive a text message from the airline that I was flying with saying:</p>
      <p>"Thanks for flying X airline. We'd like to ask you about your experience. Please go here for survey and privacy policy (link) To stop SMS text STOP."</p>
      <p>Reading the text message, I thought "What?….. I haven't even gotten on the plane yet."</p>
      <p>Rereading the text message, I was further confused as it was not clear what they wanted me to do.</p>
      <p>Did they want a comment?</p>
      <p>Did they want a score? But, if so, out of what?</p>
      <p>Did they want me to click on the link? But, it was not clear whether that was a link to the survey and the airline's privacy policy or it was a link to the airline's survey and privacy policy.</p>
      <p>What was even odder to me was that after I had landed at my destination, I didn't get another text asking how my flight was. I thought this was unusual given that the flight tends to be the central and most important part of the flying experience.</p>
      <p>My experience with the airline was not an isolated incident. I've had similar experiences with other brands, where their requests for feedback have been ill-timed, not clear, too frequent or their surveys have just required too much effort to complete, and that has put me off.</p>
      <p>Why is it that so many companies still get it so wrong when it comes to asking their customers for feedback, particularly when there is such a lot of talk and activity around customer journey mapping and better understanding the customer's experience right now?</p>
      <p>To not align a feedback request with a customer's journey feels clumsy and suggests that their surveying effort is driven more by process than anything else.</p>
      <p>But, to not take the time to make sure a survey request is unambiguous in its meaning is just plain lazy.</p>
      <p>So, when it comes to asking for feedback from customers, companies should remember two things:</p>
      <p>One, their ability to ask for feedback is a gift given their customers don't have to provide feedback; and</p>
      <p>Two, their survey process is still part of their customers' experience so to ask for feedback too often, in an unclear way, in the wrong place or in such a way that it requires too much effort can undermine the whole experience.</p>
