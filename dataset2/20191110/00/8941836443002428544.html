      <p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Indiana is home to dozens of aging dams in need of repairs to prevent possible failures that could send water cascading downstream, putting lives and property as risk.</p>
      <p>A two-year investigation by The Associated Press identified at least 1,688 dams nationwide rated as high hazard and deemed to be in poor or unsatisfactory condition.</p>
      <p>Sixty-five of those dams are found in Indiana, and they have structural problems such as cracks and erosion or spillways that might not withstand a historic storm. Water seeping through some of them is also a problem.</p>

        <p>Although Indiana has only a few large dams, the AP found that many of its high hazard dams in poor or unsatisfactory condition lack proper safeguards to alert local communities should they fail.</p>
