      <p>AVE MARIA, Fla. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ave-maria-university/">Ave Maria University</a>’s Board of Trustees has selected Christopher Ice as the private school’s next president.</p>
      <p>The university made its announcement Friday.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old is a Kansas City area native and CEO of Catholic Charities of Kansas City in St. Joseph. He will be the third president of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ave-maria-university/">Ave Maria University</a>.</p>
      <p>The Naples Daily News reports that he’ll take over in January for current President Jim Towey, who served for nearly nine years at the helm of the Catholic school.</p>
