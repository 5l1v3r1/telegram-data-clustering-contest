      <p>Bitcoin prices rose sharply today, climbing upwards of 4% in a very short period of time. The digital currency started appreciating around 11:15 a.m. EST, increasing from $8,787.11 to an intra-day high of $9,123.34 less than 10 minutes later at roughly 11:21 a.m. EST, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin">CoinDesk figures</a> show.</p>
      <p>After enjoying this rally, bitcoin has retained most of its gains, trading at $9,038.34 at the time of this writing, additional CoinDesk data reveals.</p>
      <p>[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]</p>
      <p>Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a href="https://www.bitbullcapital.com/">BitBull Capital</a>, cited technical factors for the rapid price climb.</p>
      <p>“The current move is a technical recovery,” he stated.</p>
      <p>“We mentioned previously that we expect the 50-day moving average to continue acting as support, and that has allowed the price to recover temporarily.”</p>
      <p>DiPasquale <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2019/11/08/bitcoin-struggles-to-recover-after-6-drop/#5e2941fd5c5c">noted</a> before that bitcoin’s 50-day moving average was roughly $8,600.</p>
      <p>“However, the 200-day moving average is still a strong resistance at $9,200 and Bitcoin needs to surpass that level with good volumes to put $10,000 on the radar - failing to do so would keep the possibility of a return to $8,000 alive.”</p>
      <p>Digital currency investor Marius Rupsys also spoke to technical factors, noting that bitcoin has been “trading close to 50 and 200 day moving averages.”</p>
      <p>“Traders are quite cautious around these areas. So it might be just some traders positioning themselves before Monday.”</p>
      <p>Rupsys and Dipasquale both emphasized bitcoin’s relatively low trading volume when explaining the cryptocurrency’s recent gains.</p>
      <p>The “weekend has less volume, therefore price action can have more volatility,” noted Rupsys.</p>
      <p>Dipasquale emphasized that because “volumes are low,” “price surges like this one [are] temporary and unreliable.”</p>
