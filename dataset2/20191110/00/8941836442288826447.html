      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - A former Republican California congressman says he will try to win back his old seat after the Democrat who beat him last year abruptly resigned.</p>
      <p>Steve Knight announced on his website Sunday that he will enter an anticipated special election for the seat vacated by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/katie-hill/">Katie Hill</a>.</p>
      <p>It had been the last Los Angeles County seat held by a Republican. But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/katie-hill/">Hill</a> defeated Knight as part of a Democratic wave that knocked seven California Republicans out of power in 2018.</p>
      <p>She resigned last month amid allegations that she had affairs with a campaign aide, which she confirmed, and a congressional staff member, which she denied.</p>
