      <p>China’s economy is in a deflation-inflation trap. Producer prices are falling, as consumer prices rise.That’s according to statistics <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1169461.shtml">published</a> last week by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). They show that the prices China’s factories charge to their clients are in a deflationary spiral, while prices charged by retailers to consumers are in an inflationary spiral. </p>
      <p>China’s producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, dropped at an annual rate of 1.6% in October. </p>
      <p>So far this year, PPI has declined 0.2% from that in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Factory prices of capital goods were hit the hardest, falling at an annual rate of 2.6% in October, in addition to a 2% decline in September.</p>
      <p>PPI’s fall in October is the worst year-on-year price contraction since August 2016, and it’s the result of both demand and supply pressures on the Chinese economy.</p>

      <p>On the demand side, there’s the continued weakening of exports.</p>
      <p>Exports from China declined by 0.9% year-on-year to $212.93 billion in October of 2019, following a plunge of 3.2% in September, according to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tradingeconomics.com+China%27s+home+prices&amp;oq=Tradingeconomics.com+China&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j0l2j69i60l3j5.8542j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Tradingeconomics</a>.com. It’s the third back-to-back month of yearly dip in overseas sales, due to a slowing global economy and the persisting trade dispute with America.</p>
      <p>On the supply side, there’s excess factory capacity, due to the building of factories that practically duplicate each other, as discussed in a previous piece <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/10/31/china-is-heading-for-a-long-growth-recession-not-because-of-the-trade-war/#3cfd97c2649c">here</a>. These factories churn out similar products and engage in a price war.</p>
      <p>In short, the roots of China’s PPI deflation run much deeper than the ongoing trade dispute with the US, to the structure of its economy. This means they will persist even if the trade dispute eases in the near future.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, PPI deflation will co-exist with consumer price inflation (CPI), a measure of the change in the cost of living. And the CPI is an upswing. It rose at an annual rate of 3.8% in October, up from 3% in September.</p>
      <p>That was the highest inflation rate since January 2012 — due to African swine fever decimating the country’s herds — and above the target set by China’s central bank.</p>
      <p>“The simultaneous decline in PPI and rise in the rise in CPI create a deflation-inflation trap for China’s policy makers,” says Finance Professor Christos Giannikos of Baruch College and Columbia University. “An effort to stimulate the economy and push PPI higher could also push CPI higher raising the cost of living.”</p>
      <p>It could also help pour money into the wrong places, inflating further the housing bubble, which makes it impossible for young people to buy a home and raise a family, as was discussed in a previous piece here.</p>
