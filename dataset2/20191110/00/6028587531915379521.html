      <p>The 3-5-1 Arizona Cardinals are on the road to face the 2-6 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This is the first time the Buccaneers’ coach Bruce Arians will face the Cardinals since he retired from the team after the 2017 season. Arians had a lot of success with the Cardinals and was beloved not only by the players but by the fans too. It’ll be an emotional game for both teams due to their connection to Arians. Here’s how the Cardinals can leave Tampa Bay with a win.</p>
      <h3>Capitalize on the Buccaneers’ turnovers:</h3>
      <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have struggled with turning the ball over, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/turnovers">giving up 18 turnovers this year, second behind the New York Giants</a>. The Cardinals are the opposite as they’ve only given up the ball <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/turnovers">four times so far this year</a> but haven’t had too much success with takeaways, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/turnovers">racking up seven</a>. Turnovers can make or break a game and the Cardinals will have plenty of chances to take the ball away from the Buccaneers. If the Cardinals capitalize on those mistakes, this could get ugly quickly.</p>
      <h3>Kyler Murray must shine and attack the Buccaneers’ secondary:</h3>
      <p>The Buccaneers have also struggled against the pass, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/defense/table/passing/sort/netPassingYardsPerGame/dir/desc">giving up 293.5 yards per game, dead last in the league</a>.This is the perfect opportunity for Cardinals’ coach Kliff Kingsbury and quarterback Kyler Murray to show off their offensive prowess. Murray and the offense have had signs of brilliance this season but have struggled to make it last a full game. The Buccaneers have the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/defense/table/rushing/sort/rushingYardsPerGame/dir/asc">best run defense in the league, surrendering 78.1 yards per game</a>, it makes perfect sense for the Cardinals to throw the ball often. The Buccaneers don’t have a top-tier defensive back and with the scheme and talent at display for the Cardinals, it should be enough for the team to overpower them.</p>
      <h3>Finish drives off with touchdowns, not field goals:</h3>
      <p>I’ve written about this issue in nearly every article but it’s something the Cardinals need to fix if the team wants to win games. The Cardinals can move up and down the field with the best of them, they’re able to make big plays and have put up plenty of points via field goals. However, the team has struggled to put touchdowns on the board and score within the red zone. There has been plenty of drives where the Cardinals get inside the red zone and walk away with three points. A handful of those drives occurred when the team was trailing and an argument could be made that Arizona should have been more aggressive. The Bucs have had a lot of success scoring this year, putting up <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/offense/stat/total/table/passing/sort/totalPointsPerGame/dir/desc">28.8 points per game, fourth in the league</a>. However, the Bucs are <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/defense/table/passing/sort/totalPointsPerGame/dir/desc">31st in the league in points surrendered per game with 31.5</a>, making this the perfect game for the Cardinals to fix its red zone issue.</p>
      <p>The Arizona Cardinals’ playoff dreams are nearly dead but the team is still in the hunt and can fight to secure its’ first winning record since the 2015-16 season. If Arizona can succeed in these fields, the team should leave Tampa Bay with a win.</p>
