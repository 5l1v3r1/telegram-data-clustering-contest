      <p>Zabit Magomedsharipov did what he needed to do to position himself to face the winner of UFC 245’s Featherweight title bout. On Saturday in Moscow, Russia, and in front of thousands of adoring fans, Magomedsharipov took a unanimous-decision victory over a game Calvin Kattar. Magomedsharipov’s varied striking game proved to be too much for Kattar who struggled to time the Dagestani star and to find his range. Through the first two rounds, Magomedsharipov outstruck Cattar 66-36. In the third and final frame, Kattar began to connect, and that led to him winning the round on all three judges’ scorecards.</p>
      <p>Magomedsharipov looked great through the first 10 minutes, but he did appear to slow down a bit in the third. Unlike most UFC main events, this bout was only scheduled for three rounds. Because of the way he appeared to fade, you have to wonder how well Magomedsharipov will do if he gets a shot at the winner of Max Holloway vs. Alexander Volkanovski.</p>
      <p>In any case, both men walked off with additional bonuses as the bout was named the Fight of the Night.</p>

        <b>Alexander Volkov Picks Greg Hardy Apart</b>

      <p>In the co-main event, Alexander Volkov showed there was a clear line between the elite heavyweights in the UFC and Greg Hardy. However, love him or hate him, Hardy was competitive and dangerous the entire fight.</p>
      <p>Volkov’s length and clinical striking were exactly what the doctor ordered. Hardy tried to block a kick early in the bout and it appeared to result in an injured hand for the former NFL All-Pro. After squandering a bout the last time out against a one-dimensional slugger in his loss to Derrick Lewis, Volkov was determined to stay disciplined and focus against Hardy.</p>
      <p>Despite the one-sided nature of the fight, Hardy fans should be encouraged by what they saw. The fight was the fifth of the year for Hardy and while he’s had some issues in the UFC, there is no question he has the look of a legit future contender. He can no longer be dismissed as a novelty act.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Volkov needs one more victory and then no one should be able to deny him a title shot. Apparently, that one win might have to come against Francis Ngannou.</p>
      <p>The former UFC title challenger called him out after his win.</p>
      <p>Here is a look at all of the results from Moscow.</p>
      <p>

      <p>
        <b>Ankalaev Channels His Inner Anderson Silva and Lyoto Machida</b>
      </p>
      <p>One sure way to take home a Performance of the Night bonus is to win a fight with a front kick to the face. That’s what Magomed Ankalaev did when he destroyed Dalcha Lungiambula.</p>
      <p>Ankalaev had already dismantled Lungiambula through the first two rounds with striking and some energy-absorbing ground-and-pound strikes. The front kick was set up by Lungiambula’s exhaustion. He has a long way to go if he’s going to be able to have success against the top guys in his division.</p>
      <p>Ankalaev is starting to look like the title-contending talent we thought he’d be when he arrived to the UFC. He got victimized by a last-second submission loss to Paul Craig in his debut, but he has gone on a run and is someone to watch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Zawada Was Great, But...</b>
      </p>
      <p>David Zawada looked great off his back en route to a submission win over Abubakar Nurmagomedov, the cousin of Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
      <p>However, it wasn’t a performance that was worthy of a POTN bonus on the same card that saw Danny Roberts destroy Zelim Imadaev with a single shot, and when Karl Roberson shook off a nasty eye poke to submit the previously undefeated Roman Kopylov in the final round.</p>
      <p>I think the folks in charge of determining bonuses got too caught up in Zawada beating a Nurmagomedov. We learned all Nurmagomedovs are not created equally. Zawada was a huge underdog and this was a big win, but Roberts and Roberson were more deserving of the extra money.</p>
