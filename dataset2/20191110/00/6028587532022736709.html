      <p><b>Rewriting, history</b>If Kanye West’s discography has been a stroll through his world, then, for most of his career, his Christian faith has been a small garden near the entrance. A small garden marked “Jesus Walks” that was, album by album, left farther and farther behind as we moved away from <i>The College Dropout</i> and into the increasingly harrowing landscapes of <i>Late Registration</i>, <i>Graduation</i>, <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>, <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>, <i>Watch the Throne</i>, <i>Cruel Summer</i>, and <i>Yeezus</i>. After nine years and seven albums, the spiritual garden of “Jesus Walks” could feel to many like an afterthought.</p>
      <p>But 2013’s <i>Yeezus</i> was the first indication religion was back on the mind of Kanye West, even if it was in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/watching-the-throne-a-lyrical-analysis-of-kanye-west/id1023488671?i=1000374193943">seemingly</a> blasphemous ways: comparisons to Jesus, declarations of Godhood. The website <a href="https://thinkchristian.reframemedia.com/get-behind-me-yeezus?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ThinkChristian+(Think+Christian+Blog)"><i>Think Christian</i></a><i> </i>had a review called, “Get Behind Me, Yeezus!” in which the author, John J. Thompson, had this to say: “[West] has a long history of insisting that he is a man of God, a fan of Jesus and a good person. The problem is that his lyrics paint an entirely different, morally chilling picture. If I were to walk up to a stranger on the street and say some of the things Kanye growls out on his new release, <i>Yeezus</i>, there is a decent chance I could be prosecuted for verbal assault.”</p>
      <p>Kanye followed <i>Yeezus</i> with <i>The Life of Pablo</i>. Hours before the album’s February 2016 release, he <a href="https://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=4633882.0">took to Twitter</a> to provide context, saying: “Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler... He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world... He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship...I have the right to speak my voice... Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessing to my brother [Pastor] Kirk [Franklin] for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins... All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up... Let’s dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world.” [Author note: the “...” were included by Kanye in the tweets; they don’t signify the removal of any text.]</p>
      <p>While fans and media had speculated “Pablo” referred to the duality of the artist Pablo Picasso and drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, West corrected the “memes.” Pablo was his version of Paul the Apostle. The story typically goes that Paul was originally known as Saul, a non-believer who attacked and even murdered Christians. Until one day on the road to Damascus when God appeared before Paul, blinding him, to question Paul’s behavior. For days, without sight, cared for by Christians, the stricken man contemplated his life to that point. When his vision returned, he accepted a baptism and set off as an apostle of Jesus.</p>
      <p>That same duality is present on <i>The Life of Pablo</i>, as the titular character is torn between living a sinful life of indulgence or giving himself over to faith and family. One path is easy. The other formidable. One lets you ignore everything that’s wrong with you. The other forces you to not just confront those weaknesses, but fight them, overcome them. If you zoom out, the message of <i>The Life of Pablo</i> is that family and God will redeem and enrich you in ways nothing else can.</p>
      <p>But many of the lyrics are, to borrow from John J. Thompson, still the kind of thing that could get you prosecuted for verbal assault. Typically, juxtaposition illuminates. Paul, for instance, when he was Saul, is said to have <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/why-did-god-let-paul-become-a-murderer">murdered Christians</a>. So his redemption is made all the more powerful because of the intensity of his sin. But in <i>The Life of Pablo</i>, the subtly of Kanye’s attempted display of redemption was complicated by the inability of some listeners and critics to hear past the crassness and egomania of the Saul (Sablo?) moments and understand those moments as the narrative foil that they are.</p>
      <p>Kanye himself, in 2019, at one of his pre-release listening parties for <i>Jesus Is King</i>, said calling <i>The Life of Pablo</i> a gospel album was, due to its graphic nature, incorrect. It was the the byproduct of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrislambert/2019/10/31/jesus-is-king-explained-a-guide-to-the-story-and-themes-of-kanye-wests-2019-album/#41e3db287961">his having been lost</a> as a Christian.</p>
      <p>With the advent of his Sunday Service performances, West has spent much of 2019 re-imagining not only the lyrics of popular songs as hymns to God but he has remade his own music to better reflect the shine of his Christianity. The depressed and longing “Say You Will” from <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i>, about a phone call from an ex and the existential tailspin it causes, has been transformed to a confident message about knowing God hears you and speaks to you.</p>
      <p>During “Jesus Walks,” Kanye has modified the line “I wanna talk to God but I’m afraid ‘cause we ain’t spoke in so long” to “I wanna talk to God, I ain’t afraid.”</p>
      <p>Other tracks have been re-imagined and re-framed through this gospel approach. West even told Beats 1 Zane Lowe he’d update his older material for use on tour, ridding it of anything profane.</p>
      <p>That small garden near the entrance of West’s discography has blossomed beyond its barriers. Its flowers proliferate throughout the park, beautifying even the ugliest periods of Kanye’s past.</p>
      <p>That brings us to his new video for “Follow God,” from <i>Jesus Is King</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Follow God, Otis</b>
      </p>
      <p>The video is straightforward. Kanye and his father, Ray West, walk through a snow-covered Wyoming plain to a waiting ATV. They board then take off. Nothing particularly special follows.</p>
      <p>At one point we cut to West praying to the beat. Another cut to him emphatically rapping at the dead grass, hills, and sky. There’s a shot of of a donkey and a llama by a lake. Aside from the ATV, it’s all very “this is what I’d expect from Wyoming.” In the video’s second half, the Wests have upgraded to a giant-wheeled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrjjV6nGh0g">Sherp</a> (which is not only all-terrain but amphibious). Their drive is even slower than before.</p>
      <p>There’s another shot of Ray and Kanye standing in the open, doing nothing much of anything. Then the absurd 13-seconds of the pair pulling lethargic donuts in the bulky Sherp.</p>
      <p>This might not seem particularly interesting at first, but it’s fascinating in the context of August, 2011. That was the month Kanye and Jay-Z released the music video for their hit single, “Otis.”</p>
      <p>The video begins as Jay and Kanye approach a car. The landscape is industrial. And this isn’t any car but a 2004 Maybach 57 with a price tag of $350,000. The two deconstruct it, chopping off the roof, the doors, and more. “Deconstruct” is probably too gentle of a word. They ruin the Maybach. Why? Because they can. They’re wealthy enough that it doesn’t matter to them. What would be a lifetime achievement for most of us—to own a Maybach—is nothing more than a gag to Jay and Ye. Most of the video consists of the duo in the front seat, driving recklessly, while models in the backseat laugh and hang on for dear life.</p>
      <p>When the “Otis” video dropped, Kanye and Jay-Z were only three days removed from the release of their collaborative album, <i>Watch the Throne</i>. The project was a joint declaration that the pair were at the top of the rap game. The throne is meant for the king. And what’s a king symbolize? Power and wealth. The 12-tracks were lyrical showcases of just that. Two men who came from nothing celebrating the limitless everything they had attained. From money, to material goods, to women, to respect and prestige. The “Otis” video was a perfect distillation of the album’s barbaric yawp, its echoing victory cry.</p>
      <p>
        <b>History, rewritten</b>
      </p>
      <p>After 2011, the brotherhood shared by Hov and Yeezy began to fray. 2012 had reports of the two clashing while on tour. Despite the decade-long friendship, Jay and his wife, Beyoncé, were conspicuously absent from West’s 2014 wedding. “The Throne” hadn’t been seen together much at all or heard from. West didn’t appear on Jay’s 2013 album <i>Magna Carta Holy Grail</i>, nor Jay on Ye’s 2016 <i>Pablo </i>project. By the end of 2016, West, during a concert in Seattle, would (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/10/20/kanye-talks-jay-z-during-saint-pablo-tour-stop-our-kids-never-even-played-together/92479994/">among other things</a>) bemoan the state of their relationship, admitting their daughters had never played together (Blue Ivy Carter was born in 2012, and North West in 2013).</p>
      <p>Two years later, in 2018, Jay-Z and Beyoncé would release their first collaborative project, <i>Everything Is Love</i>. While it wasn’t called <i>Watch the Throne: Redux</i>, it might as well have been. The breakout song, “Apeshit,” had a similar sound and intensity as <i>Throne</i>’s top track: “N****s in Paris.”</p>
      <p>The most obvious connection was the song title. In “in Paris,” one of the stand out lines was Kanye saying, “Got my n****s in Paris/And they going gorillas, huh.” A gorilla is an ape. Going gorillas and going apeshit* are the same thing. The chorus of “Apeshit” even has the line, “Have you ever seen the crowd goin’ apeshit?” If that was too subtle a message for anyone, as if to put an exclamation on it, Jay and Bey filmed the video where? You guessed it: Paris.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oky_e0kRTjs">LoveHappy</a>” is the final track from <i>Everything Is Love. </i>It’s notable for having verses where Beyoncé and Jay trade bars. Is it coincidence that the final track on <i>Watch the Throne</i>, “<a href="https://youtu.be/9vktyj5c7gE?t=126">Why I Love You</a>,” was notable for having verses where Kanye and Jay trade bars?</p>
      <p>In so many ways, it seemed like Jay wanted to replace <i>Watch the Throne</i>. To erase West and draw in Beyoncé. Likewise, a year later, Kanye seems to have had a similar desire. But their methods, of course, differ.</p>
      <p>Jay has found a new partner in crime to share in the pleasures of wealth and fame-flexing, the Bonnie to his Clyde.</p>
      <p>West’s abdicated his throne to God, announcing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrislambert/2019/08/31/jesus-is-king-the-kanye-west-album-15-years-in-the-making/"><i>Jesus Is King</i></a>—he luxuriates, instead, in nature and stillness and the humble bonds of family**.</p>
      <p>A title card at the end of the “Follow God” video includes the line, “It took me 42 years to realize that my dad was my best friend.”</p>
      <p>Through discovering the Father, West has discovered his father.</p>
      <p>And so the garden continues its blooming.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>*[In case you’re curious: to “go apeshit” has been a <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2018/06/apeshit-etymology-the-history-of-the-phrase-behind-beyonce-and-jay-zs-new-single.html">phrase since the 1950s</a>.]</p>
      <p>**[With that said, Sherp’s still cost $100,000. And a picture from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4p0mcXlZBx/?igshid=1o2s6mdi241oe">Kourtney Kardashian’s Instagram</a> showed Kanye owned at least 10 of them. And the Wyoming filming location is a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kanye-west-wyoming-ranch-photos-2019-9">4,000 acre ranch</a> West purchased. So he hasn’t become totally self-denying. His fame-flexing is merely a different style than Jay’s.]</p>
