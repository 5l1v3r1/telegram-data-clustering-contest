      <h1>‘Forgotten Atlas’ Dev Uses Something Called “Paper” For Design</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Paprocki</a></address>
      <p>Rafael Martin is taking an interesting approach to developing his adventure game, <i>Forgotten Atlas</i> - it’s being planned out on something called “paper.”In an era of digital everything, <a href="https://twitter.com/hypermegapixel">developing <i>Forgotten Atlas</i></a> looks a lot like the maps kids needed to make to navigate early <i>Zelda</i> games, although that’s not why Martin goes this route. “I guess it's a habit I keep from my phase as a web designer. Before building a site I have always made a sketch in my sketchbook to define the basis and the general design. It's the same as in the game levels,” writes Martin… in an email, not a paper letter. “I have tried several times to do it digitally with an iPad but at the end I go back to paper and pencil.”</p>

      <p><i>Forgotten Atlas</i> sort of started development back in 2016. Back then, Martin was tinkering with 2D art before turning to 3D around a year later. “I started to test 3D modelling in Blender. I realized that it wasn't that hard after all and, as a result, early in 2017 I was pointing the video game to 3D,” writes Martin.</p>
      <p>Inspirations include the stealth of <i>Commandos</i> and the world of <i>Gothic</i>. Martin also mentions an indie, <i>Tunic</i>, for its style.</p>
      <p>Based in Spain, Martin feels it’s a difficult place to develop games. The support systems (and major studios) don’t exist based on his experiences. </p>

      <p>“Even if you want to go indie it is a problem because of the bad approach of the State towards the freelance workers. In addition, video games have always been seen as foreign so it's also difficult to find private investors to support your idea. I would say that 90% of the influential video games developed in Spain exist thanks to micropatronage platforms as Kickstarter that allow them to get the funding,” explains Martin. </p>
      <p>Currently, <i>Forgotten Atlas</i> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/HyperMegaPixel/posts?">relies on Patreon</a>, with the possibility of a future Kickstarter. “Patreon is more immediate and allows followers to follow your progress. I think it's the perfect option when you are starting and you don't have many things from the video game to show or you don't have it all defined yet. It's a good way to allow your followers to help and support you during the process,” writes Martin.</p>
      <p>And, you can show that process on paper.</p>
