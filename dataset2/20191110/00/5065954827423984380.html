      <p>IN a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ivryin6dsM&amp;t=1s">interview</a> with fellow songwriter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6u4McS92qhRIYLtBsIl0mA">Trina Belamide</a> for her ongoing series of songwriting tips videos, Rico Blanco admits that he continuously writes songs as a hobby.</p>
      <p>For someone who considers songwriting as a mere hobby, what the enigmatic rocker and president of the <a href="http://www.filscap.com.ph/">Filipino Society of Composers, Artists and Publishers, Inc. (FILSCAP)</a> has accomplished not just for himself, but for the local music industry as a whole is nothing short of remarkable.</p>
      <p>And he did this either on his own or with Rivermaya, the band he co-founded and wrote most of the music for 23 years.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been writing for more than half of my life. I wrote my first song when I was 13. By 18, I was writing stuff like ‘214’ and by 20, I was writing songs like ‘Awit ng Kabataan’ and ‘Himala’,” he revealed to Belamide in the same video interview.</p>

      <p>Explaining the songwriting process that gave birth to more enduring classics like “Elesi,” “Ulan,” “Hinahanap-Hanap Kita,” “Kisapmata,” “Umaaraw, Umuulan,” “Liwanag sa Dilim,” “Posible”, and many more with Rivermaya alone, Rico said he just takes note of whatever comes to his mind, even in the most unexpected moments.</p>
      <p>“I can play music in my head that’s totally something new and not anyone else’s song. Even when I’m thinking of, or working on something else, I hear instruments or a beat at the back of my head. That’s my radio, that’s my Spotify,” he further shared with Trina.</p>
      <p>On his own, the very prolific Rico has released three studio albums since leaving Rivermaya: <i>Your Universe</i> (2008), <i>Galaktik Fiestamatik</i> (2012), which he put together all by his lonesome, and <i>Dating Gawi</i> (2015).</p>
      <p>Today, Rico continues to release new music, mostly in collaboration with other artists, even as some of his older, more familiar songs are covered by other artists.</p>
      <p>Early this year, Rico collaborated with funk rock sensations IV of Spades and released his “comeback” single literally titled “Nagbabalik.” The official music video of the epic rocker that partly recalls the Fiesto Bandido persona that he unleashed with <i>Galaktik Fiestamatik</i> has to date generated over 1.3 million views since it was uploaded only last July.</p>
      <p>“Isang Gabi,” a haunting ballad with a “Total Eclipse of the Heart” vibe that he wrote, produced and recorded with singer-actress Julie Anne San Jose debuted at number 1 on iTunes Philippines all-genre chart. Describing Rico as one of the greats in the industry, Julie Anne said she was just excited to work with him on the song.</p>
      <p>“Abot Langit,” a quirky, sexy number written in collaboration with rising actress-singer Maris Racal has earned nearly 1 million views for its official music video plus another 308,000 views for Maris and Rico’s bossa nova-flavored “#Ricovered.”</p>
      <p>The synth-heavy “Baka Sakali” sees him joining forces with radio and TV host slash singer-actress Joyce Pring is also doing well while sought after actor Carlo Aquino has struck gold with his rendition of “Balisong (Transformed).”</p>
      <p>Former Moonstar88 lead singer Acel, now a successful solo artist on her own right, recently covered Rico’s “Your Universe” for the romantic-comedy film, “Between Maybes”. To date, the official lyric video of Acel’s piano-driven rendition of the well-loved ballad has earned over 279,000 views.</p>
      <p>Another popular Rivermaya ballad, “You’ll Be Safe Here” was recently covered by St. Wolf, a promising band known for its smooth sound dubbed as “<i>swabecore</i>.” “You’ll Be Safe Here” was the theme song of the hit ABS-CBN thriller series, “Spirits” in 2005.</p>
      <p>Rico’s latest is “Napapaligiran” which is credited to both him and The Good Times. Its lyric video, uploaded only last Friday, November, now has over 11,000 views.</p>
      <p>At Spotify, Rico remains a formidable presence as he currently commands over 475,000 monthly listeners in the popular streaming channel while his former band, Rivermaya, has over 796,000 monthly listeners. The band’s top 5 most streamed songs are written by Rico.</p>
      <p>And as if to further underscore the extent of Rico’s influence and legacy, 9 Works Theatrical recently teased what appears to be an upcoming jukebox musical based on his greatest hits. In a report by <a href="https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/rico-blanco-musical-9-works-theatrical-2020-interview">Bandwagon Asia</a>, Rico has confirmed that the equally formidable theater company is now “working on the story and which songs to include.”</p>
      <p>9 Works Theatrical has just concluded its production of <i>Himala The Musical</i> based on the classic Ishmael Bernal film. Coincidentally, “Himala” is also the title of one of Rivermaya’s biggest hits that Rico wrote.</p>
      <p>For someone who is now considered by most millennials as one of the more senior statesmen in the local music scene, Rico Blanco’s remarkable body of work is still very much everywhere as he continues to cast a large shadow in the scheme of things. We can only expect bigger things from him in the days to come.</p>
