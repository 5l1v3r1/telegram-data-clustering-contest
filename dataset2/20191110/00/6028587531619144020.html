      <p>As odd as it may sound, Lionel Messi wasn’t even <i>that</i> good at the Camp Nou on Saturday night.But still, his individual brilliance and genius was enough to seal a 4-1 win over Celta Vigo that sent FC Barcelona back to the top of the La Liga and naturally, the Catalan press fell over itself to hail him.</p>
      <p>‘Messi Messi Messi And Only Messi,’ ran the headline to SPORT this morning in Spain.</p>
      <p>‘Barça is still the leader of LaLiga thanks to another exhibition from the Argentine crack, who achieved a dead ball hat trick,’ it was said.</p>
      <p>‘Another Dead Ball Lesson From Messi,’ went to the title to one piece, whereas elsewhere Javier Giraldo’s started with a clever double entendre and play on words.</p>
      <p>In Spanish reading ‘<i>Messi hace más falta que nunca</i>’, this could be understood as Messi scoring more free kicks than ever and also that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner is ‘needed more than ever’ by the rest of the squad.</p>
      <p>‘In a rather gray match of the Barça team, whose game continues to offer more doubts than certainties,’ wrote Giraldo, ‘the figure of Messi, as in so many other games, rose above the rest to rescue Barça.’</p>
      <p>‘Without Messi, this Barça is flat and at times, predictable,’ contined Giraldo. ‘But when the Argentine appears, anything can happen. Ask [new Celta Vigo coach] Oscar Garcia: he will never forget that his debut as a coach in the First Division was absolutely marked by three hits from Messi.’ </p>
      <p>‘If Messi doesn’t win the Ballon d’Or it will be a global scandal,’ dived in the daily newspaper’s director Ernest Folch.</p>
      <p>‘When Barça was suffering the most, Leo Messi appeared.  How many chronicles of the last decade have started with this phrase? For one more night the same words are rewritten,  but this time with another savage [performance] to add in the unlikely curriculum of Leo Messi.’ </p>
      <p>‘The incredible thing is not that Barça's '10' marks two identical  and unstoppable free kicks but that the goalkeeper cannot do anything even knowing what will happen,’ Folch explained. ‘And it is that Messi has invented another play, the penalty outside the area, and rival teams begin to take it as a maximum penalty, an inevitable fatality that will end in a goal.’</p>
      <p>‘Apart from Messi's hat-trick, the highlight of the game was ...Leo Messi: his conductions, passes, assists and direction of the game was almost the only salvageable thing from another indigestible Barça match,’ gushed Folch.</p>
      <p>‘He’s A Genius’ was splashed across the front of Catalonia’s other big publication, Mundo Deportivo, and either in it or across their website, the complimentary term was bandied around frequently in relation to the 32-year-old.</p>
      <p>‘Messi, A Dead Ball Genius,’ Gabriel Sans called his piece in tribute to a ‘magician who turns free kicks into penalties and his game into a lifesaver’.</p>
      <p>Joan Poqui spoke of ‘a new exhibition of talent, rage and goals from Leo Messi’.</p>
      <p>‘Pissed off for his loss of the ball  [when fouling to concede the free kick that Celta equalised with] and, above all, for the outrage of Cuadra, Messi fixed it in less than three minutes. He picked up the ball after a run by Arthur that ended in a foul and nailed it. Another prodigious goal from a direct free kick. Outstanding, even if it doesn't seem like it because he does it often. Well, almost always.’</p>
      <p>‘If it is necessary to repeat, it is repeated,’ said Poqui of the third to confirm the hat trick. ‘And Messi repeated.’</p>
      <p>Receiving a maximum four stars from MD for his contribution, SPORT was more vehement with its justifaction for dishing out a 10 to the captain.</p>
      <p>‘He is the beginning and the end of everything, yin and yang, the Creator, the Almighty, the Maker,’ they said of Messi. ‘When he decided it was, it was. God exists and plays in Barça.’</p>
