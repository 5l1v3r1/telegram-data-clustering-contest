      <p>MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - Montana wildlife authorities are investigating the poaching of a mule deer buck in southwest Montana.</p>
      <p>KECI-TV reports that Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks game warden Justin Singleterry says the case involves a 4x4 buck that was found poached east of Corvallis in the Bitterroot Valley.</p>
      <p>An investigation determined the buck was killed on location and then discarded down a steep embankment. Nothing was taken from the deer and all meat left to waste.</p>
      <p>A member of the public reported the deer poached last Thursday. The deer may have been killed days before it was discovered.</p>
