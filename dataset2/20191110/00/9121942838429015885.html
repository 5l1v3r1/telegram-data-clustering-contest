      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah has unilaterally withdrawn his team’s election observers from an official recount of ballots ahead of long-delayed election results.</p>
      <p>Abdullah says Sunday the results will have no legitimacy if his team’s observers are not present during the recount by Afghanistan’s Independent Election Commission.</p>
      <p>Abdullah is a partner in the country’s unity government headed by President Ashraf Ghani, his lead contender in the election.</p>
      <p>Ghani has not so far withdrawn his observers from the recount, but other candidates have expressed frustration with the process.</p>
      <p>Polling was held on Sept. 28, but the announcement of results repeatedly postponed after accusations of misconduct and technical issues with counting ballots.</p>
      <p>Preliminary election results are expected on Nov. 14.</p>
