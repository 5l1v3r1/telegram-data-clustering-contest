      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>Fancy yourself a budding John Torode, Gregg Wallace, Joe Bastianich or Christina Tosi? If you’re a MasterChef fan, the judges, and the TV programme, will need no introduction.<br/><br/>The competitive cooking show kicked off in the UK in 1990 and has since been aired in 60 countries around the world. But while the TV show is a global concept, MasterChef, the TV Experience in Dubai Marina is the first of its kind. And although fans of the hit show will be in their element, you don’t need to be a MasterChef know-it-all to enjoy it.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/410668-50-best-dishes-in-dubai-of-2019">Dishes</a> on the menu all come from contestants and champions from various global editions of the reality TV show. So it’s fair to say expectations are high. After all those judges know their stuff. But does it translate from telly to real life? We’re pleased to say a resounding yes.<br/><br/>The menu is fun and accessible and won’t terrify you in terms of fancy ingredients or, happily, price tags. And it’s far less gimmicky than you might imagine.<br/><br/>If you’re up for the full TV experience you can opt for a Mystery Box, where you’ll have a surprise meal whipped up for you.<br/><br/>But it’s well worth exploring the à la carte menu. MasterChef UK 2017 winner Saliha Mahmood’s quail dish with sweet figs and served with a bulgur wheat salad and whipped walnut relish is a delightful nod to the Middle East.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the roasted curried cauliflower and warm quinoa salad from Jane Devonshire (MasterChef UK champion, season 12) is packed with cauliflower, sultanas, almonds and pomegranate for a tasty sweet-savoury combination.<br/><br/>Fish fans, there are some utterly superb dishes to check out. The lobster tortellini from Australian finalist Laura Cassai is an <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397978-dubais-best-italian-restaurants-2019">Italian</a>-<a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397973-dubais-best-asian-restaurants-2019">Asian</a>-style combination, with plump little <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/389565-dubais-best-pasta-dishes-2019">pasta</a> parcels swimming in a spicy lemongrass soup. Meanwhile Shelina Permalloo’s – MasterChef UK champion season 8 – Mauritian warm octopus salad is stunning, bursting with flavour and perfectly charred.<br/><br/>Service is friendly and fun, the relaxed lay out is a careful nod to the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/films">TV</a> set – complete with a kitchen table area and famous clock – it’s just a shame there aren’t many diners to enjoy it.<br/><br/>As Wallace would say, “Get your pudding spoon out and man up.” Or just make a date, now.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Restaurant based around the popular TV show<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>It’s fun, friendly and the food is surprisingly excellent</p>
