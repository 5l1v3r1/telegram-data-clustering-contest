      <p>By Jyoti Punwani <br/><br/><i>Doggedly following judicial process for riot victims, a reporter finds trauma, kindness, and surprises in court<br/></i><br/>Mandir wahin banayengey.” I first heard the cry in the late 1980s, and never did I imagine that one day it would come to pass. I well recall the night of October 30, 1990, the day the Babri Masjid was first attacked. In those days I worked at The Independent. The front page was being laid out and the photograph of a handful of Bajrang Dal activists trying to vandalise Babri Masjid was going as the lead visual. In the newsroom, I heard for the first time, some colleagues crowing about how the then UP chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav’s claim, that “not even a dove will be able to flap its wings around Babri Masjid”, had proved to be hollow. <br/><br/>I had been following the build- up to this moment from 1986, with first the yatras and abhiyans of the VHP, and then LK Advani’s rath yatra. In this time, I met the fanatical young men who distributed trishuls, and the novices who accepted these weapons in pseudo-religious ceremonies infused with anti-Muslim rhetoric. But I had never imagined my own colleagues endorsing those sentiments, though not in so many words. <br/><br/>Two years after that night in the newsroom, Babri Masjid was demolished, and with lightning speed, the 1,500 km between Ayodhya and Mumbai disappeared. Riots broke out in Mumbai by the evening of December 6, 1992. <br/><br/>In the intervening 27 years, I have tried to understand the madness that engulfed this city by trying to meet those who were affected. I wanted to tell the stories of those, mainly the victims, whose versions found little space in the mainstream media but who were heard patiently for five years by a sitting high court judge. Images of those days of the Srikrishna Commission hearings remain imprinted in memory. Visibly nervous, dirt-poor Muslim victims who stood up to hostile cross-examination by English-speaking lawyers, khaki-clad senior inspectors reduced to stammering wrecks, wiping their brows in the witness stand responding to the commission’s sharp questioning. <br/><br/>I also saw a rather cocky Ram Dev Tyagi (former CP) laughing as he stepped down from the witness box after breezing through his cross-examination. But this same man looked very different four years later, as he emerged from Mazgaon court following a hearing in the murder case against him in the January 1993 Suleman Usman Bakery incident that had left eight innocent Muslims dead. These, too, were small victories, I realised later. <br/><br/>Right from the start of the riots until the very end of the decades-long process, there’s been no justice (not just for the victims, but for the Muslim community as a whole) in the Babri Masjid case. But what does one do? Some have simply borne up stoically. Like the son of the maulana killed during the Suleman Usman Bakery raid. Last week, he appeared in court as a prosecution witness for the fifth time, only to be sent back. The hearing didn’t take place. <br/><br/>Then there’s the boy whose father and brother were killed in their own house by local Shiv Sainiks. I’ve seen him grow from a tongue-tied college youth to a well-mannered IT executive who now works in the Gulf. There’s Farooq Mapkar, shot through the shoulder as he bent down for namaz in Wadala’s Hari Masjid. All these <br/>victims lived in ghettoes during the riots, or shifted there later. They should have made ideal candidates to be radicalised, and yet this maulana’s son — a Deoband graduate who was just 12 when his father was tortured and shot dead for no fault except that he was a Muslim — will dutifully return to court the next time he is summoned, even though he’s sure the policemen who killed his father won’t be punished. <br/><br/>After the 2012 Azad Maidan rally that ended in violence, Mapkar, whose own fight for justice drags on, pulled up Muslim youth who were harassing a Hindu. On Saturday, when Mapkar called me to vent his anger and frustration at the Supreme Court judgment, he didn’t forget to point out the only silver lining: a Hindu lawyer had fought the Muslims’ case brilliantly and all along, he reminded me, Hindus had fought for him too. <br/><br/>This was something I discovered very early: not all the hate spread by LK Advani’s rath yatra and by Saamna had been enough to turn Hindus and Muslims into rabid enemies. There was the Hindu schoolboy who saw the temple in his Nagpada home being desecrated, as his Muslim neighbours sheltered him. His family shifted to distant Dombivli, but this boy kept going back to his Muslim friends in Nagpada. “Friends remain friends,”’ he simply said. <br/><br/>Barely a month after the Radhabai Chawl incident where six Hindus — all but one of them women — were burnt alive by Muslims in Jogeshwari, a local Muslim driver was called back to work by his Hindu employer, also a Jogeshwari resident. Sadly the driver was arrested for the Radhabai Chawl incident, only to be acquitted by the Supreme Court five years later. <br/><br/>Pursuing riot cases, I’ve often been the only person in the courtroom, apart from the judge and the typist, and sometimes, the PP or the accused. A curious magistrate once asked me why I came there every day, and when I replied that I was following up on the riot cases, she expressed sympathy for my boring work. Little did she know! There’s no place more interesting than a court; in no other place have so many of the stereotypes I nurtured, been broken. Not all cops were cold-blooded monsters, I realised, as most of them struggled to explain the indiscriminate arrests they had made during the riots — of Muslims of course, but also of Hindus. Rioters, I found, were often regular people like the rest of us, swayed temporarily by venomous demagogues or by partisan police, only to regret their actions later. <br/><br/>It was in court that I met Madhukar Sarpotdar. Accused in two serious riot offences and finally convicted in one, the late Sena leader turned out to be quite different from the rabble-rouser I’d expected. Courteous and soft-spoken, dressed in spotless white, he would attend every hearing punctually, chide me for always writing against him and, seeing that I was as regular as he was, he once even turned around to ask (with a twinkle in his eyes) if the next date sought by his lawyer suited me. <br/>It was in these courts that I learnt that justice might be impossible to get, despite our ‘secular’ Constitution, but there are other, smaller vindications. A Muslim <br/>living in a Sena-dominated area refused to identify those who’d attacked his home in court. Outside the court premises, they touched his feet in tearful gratitude. “They came to me last night begging me not to identify them,’’ he explained to me. Was his act one of defeat or magnanimity? A Hindu, whose brother had been killed during the riots, refused to identify the Muslim accused as his killer. After the hearing, he and the accused went home together. “I don’t know who killed my brother, there was violence all over,” the Hindu told me. “Will pointing a finger at my neighbour bring my brother back?” <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest surprise for me has been the change in Muslim attitudes towards the Sena. Years after the riots, I managed to trace an unusual Muslim — a chairman of his Hindu-dominated housing society who had been hounded out during the riots. I found him living in a Muslim ghetto. But he had joined the Sena. The Sena government of 1995-99 had recognised his caste as OBC, something that the Congress had refused to do. In the political crises that played out in the state last week, a majority of Muslims were rooting for the Shiv Sena against the BJP. Sometimes I wonder if I am the only one who remembers the ugliness of 1992-93.</p>
