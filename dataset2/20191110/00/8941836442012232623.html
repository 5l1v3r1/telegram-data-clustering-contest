      <p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Rhode Island lawmakers are asking a judge to dismiss <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gina-raimondo/">Gov. Gina Raimondo</a>’s challenge to a new medical marijuana and hemp law.</p>
      <p>The Democratic governor wants the state Superior Court to block legislation giving lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry.</p>
      <p>The provision was included in the new state budget approved by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers argue in a legal motion Friday that court doesn’t need to intervene because House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio have committed to repeal the language when the legislature reconvenes in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gina-raimondo/">Raimondo</a> says legislative leaders should convene sooner rather than wait until next year.</p>
