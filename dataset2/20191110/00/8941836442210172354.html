      <p>MARATHON, Fla. (AP) - A Florida resident has won a stone crab claw eating competition in the Florida Keys.</p>
      <p>Miamian Kevin Bombardier bested 23 rivals Saturday by cracking and consuming 25 stone crab claws in 14 minutes and 16 seconds, a new record at the Keys Fisheries Stone Crab Claw Eating Contest.</p>
      <p>Marathon, Florida, residents Greg D’Agostino and Ryan Beckett claimed a fifth consecutive top team title, finishing in 6:40.</p>
      <p>Contestants had to pick claws completely clean of meat in the fastest time. Meat left behind resulted in time penalties.</p>
      <p>The Keys contribute an estimated 40 percent of Florida’s annual stone crab claw harvest.</p>

      <p>The fishery is considered a renewable resource because of the crabs’ ability to re-grow harvested claws.</p>
