      <p>Joining the leadership circle of an organization is exciting. From my own experience and in talking to rising executives, I find there's enthusiasm for the challenge as well as hand-wringing when it comes to the details, especially if it’s new to you. I write frequently about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2018/09/05/indelible-impressions">career lessons</a>, where <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2017/09/13/where-creative-directors-go">creative</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matzucker/2019/01/22/account-people">account</a> people end up, not to mention my <a href="https://www.rising-podcast.com/">new podcast</a> on marketing careers. I thought it would be valuable to get into the paperwork stress as one takes on a new senior job. What does one look for, or ask for? Does one need an attorney, and if so, on what? </p>
      <p>To answer these questions, I spoke to peers who like me have been through this as well as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/howard-matalon-85418415/">Howard Matalon</a>, an employment attorney and partner at OlenderFeldman. Matalon, who I know from childhood, is one of few lawyers with a “360” practice representing both management and employees. He is also a certified Human Resources professional. “We’re putting executives at eye level with employers on employment agreements for a good reason,” he explained. “Human capital is the most important asset of a business. If expectations are better aligned from day one, the relationship will be stronger and last longer.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Fundamentals</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Employment agreements are about allocating the risk of the relationship between employers and executives. That’s why each side has a different agenda in the negotiations process,” Matalon offers. “Employers want flexibility, so everything is written in basic, general terms. That’s why you see short offer letters rather than lengthy agreements for all but key management now. Execs want certainty and definite terms on comp, promotional opportunity, termination, etc. Neither side gets everything they want. The art is in finding compromise without killing the deal.”</p>
      <p>Here are tips for new executives (and those who have been around the block), eager to sign their first big gig:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Be a leader from the start</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Start with your objectives. </b>"The one thing executives don’t think through is what they want,” noted Matalon. Why are you applying? If you don’t know what you want, how can you manage that into a new career. </li>
        <li><b>Do your own due diligence.</b> Figure out the business. The title may sound good, but know where it fits in the organization. What is the company looking for, and why? What is the CEO’s expectations for the role? One buddy investigates by going right to the top. Perhaps someone in your network can connect you to someone on the board, he suggests.</li>
        <li><b>Get a job description.</b> If there’s no description in the offer, there’s no way for you to baseline expectations. Do they know why they’re hiring you? Do you know what you're in for and what you bring to the table?</li>
        <li><b>Be judicious in what you share.</b> In an increasing number of cities and states, they can’t ask what you currently make. If pushed, tell the employer in broad strokes what your comp <i>expectations</i> are (<i>i.e.,</i> base salary, bonus and equity commensurate with position, skill set and experience). </li>
        <li><b>Project manage yourself.</b> While it doesn't hurt to ask for changes, Matalon cautions that your approach <i>really</i> matters. "Make the number of asks few in nature, even group them by topic. Plan out your discussions. You shouldn’t be doing death by hundred cuts, asking questions every day. Employers will just walk away, finding someone easier to deal with.”</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>The devil is in the details (or lack thereof)</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Learn to speak employment.</b> Phrases like “discretionary bonus,” “target bonus <i>up to</i>” or “must be actively employed” mean that the employer reserves the right to deny, deprive or limit its obligation to pay compensation. Up to can mean zero. Define what it will be based on. If objectives can’t be set now, perhaps within a timeframe (e.g., the first thirty days). Note that in your first job, at least in marketing fields, you’re unlikely to get guaranteed bonus. Follow any links in your electronic offer letter too. “They can involve critical documents requiring a close read, like non-competes,” Matalon says.</li>
        <li><b>Ignorance is never bliss</b><u>.</u> Employers often leave out terms to give them breathing room you can’t afford to ignore, including the scope of your job, when compensation will be paid or earned, what happens if you are fired before the compensation is paid etc.  </li>
        <li><b>Willing to be at will.</b> Most employment is “at will,” allowing employers to terminate you for any lawful reason. A severance provision providing a specific number of months of base salary may be your best defense to a firing decision. "If the employer gets to decide when it’s convenient to let you go, there can be bargained accountability for that decision,” argues Matalon. But be wary, he adds. Many employers include a “Cause” provision allowing them to terminate you for performance reasons with no severance unless this is specifically addressed upfront. One peer of mine remembers he was so concerned with failure in his first leadership job, he asked for a 90-day severance agreement. As he confidently continued into the middle of his career with a good track record of employability, he became less concerned about safety nets and more concerned about negotiating for a good potential upside.</li>
        <li><b>The best defense is a good…</b> The inclusion of a “Good Reason” clause can force employers to pay severance if they adversely change your job duties and responsibilities, reporting line, or fail to pay you some part of your compensation or benefits. Think of it as your own “Cause” provision.</li>
        <li><b>(In)equity.</b> The terms and conditions of equity offers are usually the most complex aspects of a comp package and often require a legal or tax advisor to unravel. Make sure you understand the nature of the equity (options vs. grants), its tax treatment, the vesting and the liquidity of the equity. Find out what happens if the business ownership changes (equity vesting may accelerate) or if you lose your job (which can deprive you of unvested equity).</li>
        <li><b>Non-compete is not insignificant.</b> Common in leadership roles and often buried in confidentiality and stock agreements, this can be a non-compete with competitors and/or with customers. Some agreements could prevent you from working in your own industry. You might tie a severance agreement to the length of any agreed to. Non-compete laws are changing, however, with some states eliminating them for a more free market economy.</li>
        <li><b>Speak no evil.</b> On separation, Matalon has seen terms like “non-disparagement” clauses spill over from separation agreements into those governing your job itself. That can chill your ability to do your job (e.g prevent reporting wrongdoing) or give an excuse to terminate you without the severance you bargained for. </li>
        <li><b>Surprises</b>. Will you need to do a drug test? One former colleague, now a head of marketing, was unexpectedly asked for one.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Neither Seen Nor Heard</b>
      </p>
      <p>I come from a family of lawyers, so while I’m comfortable with the expertise, I know others may not be. Matalon recommends if the comp terms are complex and include bonus schemes or equity, you need a lawyer. “Better to invest a few dollars now for the counseling rather than find out the hard way that the offer isn’t worth the paper it is printed on.” </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Be tactical.</b> Your attorney should be your silent partner, coach and document editor.  Don’t bring the lawyer out, or the employer will too. An exception is if there is a complicated tax or golden parachute issue. As Matalon says, “If you can’t negotiate for yourself on non-legal matters, the employer has reason to question whether you will be effective at your job.”</li>
        <li><b>I got a guy.</b> Don’t use your general business lawyer or play one. “You can’t Google your way to a great contract. Find someone that understands the ins and outs of employment law and leverage and, better yet, your <i>industry</i> as well.”</li>
        <li><b>Pro tip:</b> Ask for a fixed fee. If hourly, get a budgeted amount. Much of this, according to Matalon, can be accomplished in a handful of hours unless complex equity or tax related issues exist.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>The quest for certainty</b>
      </p>
      <p>On average, employers won’t terminate an offer because of reasonable negotiation looking for clarity. If it costs them nothing to make a change, and they refuse to make it (i.e., “We don’t do that here”), it could be a signal they’re not agile or adaptive enough or just not a great company for you. Either way, it’s two parties working out an agreement to work together. A good understanding becomes a good foundation, and on top of that you can get to the real work to be done.</p>
