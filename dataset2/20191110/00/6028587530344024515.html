      <p>BlizzCon <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/01/can-we-stop-hating-on-diablo-3-ahead-of-blizzcons-diablo-4-reveal/#51b495162e38">has come and gone</a>, and with it, the debut of two big new games, <i>Overwatch 2</i> and <i>Diablo 4</i>, both of which lack release dates. <i>Diablo 4</i> feels like the further off game, still years away, potentially, and yet it showed off a <i>ton</i> of stuff both inside and outside of the show.One showcase that I think got mostly overlooked was from an extensive preview run through Game Informer. Though their cover story went through most of Blizzard’s properties, Diablo 4 was a big focus. Now, I’ve seen that GI has published three videos of the three playable classes that add up to pretty much a full hour of Diablo 4 gameplay, all of which I had not seen before.</p>
      <p>You can watch all three bits of footage below, and when you’re satisfied, I wanted to talk a bit about my impressions, at least from watching, though not playing.</p>
      <p>Barbarian:</p>
      <p>Druid:</p>
      <p>Sorceress:</p>
      <p>So, after all that, what to make of it?</p>
      <p>Here’s what I like. The environments here are <i>truly</i> gorgeous. I always wondered how <i>Diablo</i> would continue to evolve over time, given that it needed to stay with this kind of isometric format, but they really have done a fantastic job with the environment design here, which goes well beyond anything we’ve seen from the series to date. I hope the final build does not lose any of this detail.</p>
      <p>Of the three classes shown here, I feel like the Barbarian is looking the strongest with its movesets and different weapons. I have always been a Barbarian main so perhaps I’m a bit biased, but I like what I see here.</p>
      <p>Past that, gameplay still feels a bit…off to me in general. It seems very slow, very plodding. Granted, that may be because these characters are at a lower power level, but I think the D4 team has gone out of their way to make things a bit slower and less arcade-y than <i>Diablo 3. </i>I am not sure I love that change, based on what I’m seeing here. Part of the fun of Diablo 3 was tearing through legions of demons like a maniac not…hacking through one or two every so often.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, while I like the detail of the environments, I do feel like overall the view of most sequences comes off as a bit of a blur of grey and brown and makes things feel a bit dreary and lifeless. Yes, yes I know it’s <i>Diablo</i> and we want things to be scary and evil, but there’s haunting and there’s drab, and a lot of this falls into the former camp for me.</p>
      <p>I want to see what else the game has in store across other classes. Given how intimately we’re being tied to <i>Diablo 2</i> here, I’m willing to almost guarantee we will see the Amazon and Necromancer. Maybe the Assassin too. Maybe the Demon Hunter if they’re not erasing D3 entirely.</p>
      <p>Again, I wonder about how much footage they’re showing off and what kind of build this actually is if the game is still so many years away. This feels like something that may have been crafted just for the show and the reveal, so I wonder how much it will truly represent the final product in the end. I guess I’ll get back to you on that in 2022 or something.</p>
