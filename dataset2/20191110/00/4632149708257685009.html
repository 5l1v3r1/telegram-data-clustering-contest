      <p>Court sets Dec 24 as last day for prosecution to present evidence <br/><br/>While the Ayodhya land battle was decided by the highest court on Saturday, a criminal case to punish those responsible for demolishing the Babri Masjid and the violence that followed, in 1992, continues to remain pending before a special CBI court, in Lucknow. <br/><br/>A trial court verdict is only the first step towards the completion of the case as its judgment can be challenged in the High Court, followed by the Supreme Court. <br/>The sessions court in Lucknow has set December 24 as the last day for the prosecution to present evidence, in accordance with a Supreme Court order. The court had recently criticised the prosecution for not presenting witnesses against Kalyan Singh, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, despite its repeated orders after charges were framed on September 29, 2019. <br/><br/>The trial against BJP leaders LK Advani, Uma Bharti and Murali Manohar Joshi had started at the Lucknow special court on May 25, 2017, after the Supreme Court on April 19, 2017 struck down an Allahabad High Courtâ€™s order discharging them in the case. <br/><br/>Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the mosque was razed on December 6 in 1992, was put to trial two years later in September 2019 when his term as Rajasthan Governor got over. As Governor he had immunity from the legal procedure. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court in its order on April 19, 2017 had ordered the trial to be completed within two years. The apex court had again on July 19, 2019 directed that the judgment in the case be delivered within a period of nine months. <br/><br/>The agency had taken over the investigation in two crimes -- crime no 197 of 1992 against kar sevaks for bringing down the structure and crime no 198 of 1992 against eight accused Advani, Ashok Singhal, Vinay Katiar, Uma Bharati, Sadhvi Ritambara, Murli Manohar Joshi, Giriraj Kishore and Vishnu Hari Dalmia related to hate speech. <br/>The CBI on October 5, 1993 filed a consolidated charge sheet against 48 persons adding 13 accused Bala Saheb Thackeray, Kalyan Singh, Moreshwar Save, Champat Rai Bansal, Satish Pradhan, Mahant Avaidyanath, Dharam Das, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, Mahamadleshwar Jagdish Muni, Ram Bilas Vadanti, Vaikunth Lal Sharma, Prama Hans Ram Chandra Das, and Dr. Satish Chandra Nagar. <br/><br/>On October 8, 1993 the state government amended its notification to include crime number 198 against the eight persons to be tried in Lucknow. The notification was struck down. <br/><br/>The CBI filed a supplementary charge sheet against the eight accused in 1996 at Lucknow. <br/><br/><br/>On September 9,1997, a special judge in Lucknow passed an order that there was a prima facie case against all the accused persons for framing charges of criminal conspiracy under Section 120-B read with various other sections of the Penal Code. <br/><br/>Initially, the CBI cited around 894 witnesses in the cases. However, hundreds of these witnesses went missing, the investigation agency claimed. As many as 280 witnesses have appeared before the special CBI court in Lucknow. <br/><br/><br/>A lawyer, representing the accused in the case, said only investigating officers remained to be examined as witnesses. As for the case against kar sevaks, nearly all the witnesses fifty-seven of them have been examined.</p>
