      <p>BRASILIA: Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro asked his supporters Saturday (Nov 9) "not to give ammunition to the scoundrel," the day after popular leftist leader <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/brazil-s-leftist-icon-lula-walks-free-from-jail-12078122">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> walked free from jail.</p>
      <p>Breaking his silence on the release of his arch-nemesis, Bolsonaro told his Twitter followers: "Lovers of freedom and good, we are a majority. We cannot make mistakes."</p>

      <p>He added Lula was "momentarily free, but guilty."</p>
      <p>Lula's exit from jail on Friday came a day after a controversial Supreme Court ruling that could release thousands of convicts.</p>
      <p>In an impassioned address to hundreds of supporters who greeted him as he left the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba, Lula vowed to keep fighting for poor people.</p>
      <p>He also denounced the economic policies of Bolsonaro, who was swept to power in 2018 in an election Lula had been widely tipped to win.</p>
