      <p>A former Home and Away actor has told of the 'mental hell' he endured being raped as a child 40 years ago.</p>
      <p>Trevor Allan Dale, 60, was sentenced on Friday to a minimum of five years and eight months in prison for raping former soap star Bryan Wiseman.</p>
      <p>The brutal attack left the then-10-year-old bleeding and in 'excruciating' pain.</p>
      <p>Bryan was repeatedly abused by Dale at his family home in Sylvania, southern Sydney in Australia in 1980.</p>
      <p>The abuse started when he was cornered behind a granny flat when they played in the family's yard.</p>
      <p>He said he got in trouble after the assault because his father thought damage to the granny flat's fibro wall was caused by his soccer ball.</p>

      <p>In a victim impact statement, Bryan told the New South Wales District Court: "I have been a prisoner to what Trevor Dale has done to me for 40 years and there is no sentence that can make up for the mental hell that I have endured."</p>
      <p>Bryan also said he was in year seven when he tried to warn a child living on Dale's street about the paedophile.</p>
      <p>But it led to an onslaught of 'horrendous teasing and bullying' at school.</p>
      <p>He revealed: "I was called names such as 'c***sucker...this teasing would happen on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old actor has been diagnosed with chronic depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>"During my really bad times over the years I have even planned my own suicide - and planned how I would kill myself so as not to be found," he explained.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want anyone at my funeral as I did not feel worthy enough."</p>
      <p>It was only in 2017 Bryan went to New South Wales Police, which sparked a two-year investigation.</p>

      <p>Dale was caught after police taped a phone call between Bryan and Dale, in which Dale told him the abuse 'was a bit of fun'.</p>
      <p>Judge Siobhan Herbert said in court there'd been 'zero evidence of remorse'. Dale pleaded guilty to the rape and indecent assault and two other counts of indecent assault.</p>
      <p>Bryan rose to fame as Dr John Wilson in Australian TV series 'Home and Away' - starring between 1998 and 2003.</p>
