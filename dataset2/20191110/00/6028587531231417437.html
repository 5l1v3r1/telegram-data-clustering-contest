      <p>During the holidays, there’s no shortage of visual dazzle in cities and towns around the world, but to enjoy the sights and events of the season in extra-special settings head to a majestic stately or historic home. Here are eight destinations in England and France (listed alphabetically) not to miss.<b>ENGLAND</b></p>

      <p>Set on some 2000 acres, <a href="https://www.blenheimpalace.com/">Blenheim Palace</a> is one of England’s largest and most magnificent residences, the seat of the dukes of Marlborough since the 18th century, and where Winston Churchill was born. (Grandson of the seventh duke, he never held a hereditary title, and declined dukedoms from the monarchy after WW II and when he retired.) <a href="https://www.blenheimpalace.com/christmas/">Holiday happenings </a>at Blenheim provide extraordinary visual treats, among them a one-mile light trail, including a tunnel with over 100,000 sparklers, a woodland laser garden, and a dramatic light show projected on the palace’s lengthy facade. Despite the grandeur of Blenheim’s interior, children should feel at home, as state rooms will have an Alice in Wonderland theme this year. There’s also a Christmas market at Blenheim from November 22 to December 15.</p>

      <p>When you approach <a href="https://www.castlehoward.co.uk/">Castle Howard</a>, the North Yorkshire stately famously used as the setting for the televsion series <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>, it’s easy to have a reaction similar to that described by the novel’s author, Evelyn Waugh, when his protagonist Charles Ryder sees the fictional Bridehead for the first time— astonishment–and during the holidays the property offers more stunning splendor. Visit the castle’s grand salons lit with candles and glowing fireplaces, as music flows in the background, and take in the huge Christmas tree in the Great Hall, one that typically can absorb 3000 ornaments. This year’s seasonal program, called a “<a href="https://www.castlehoward.co.uk/whats-on/christmas">Christmas Masquerade</a>,” will play up the castle’s Italian baroque origins and connections to the theater with decor and installations by Charlotte Lloyd Weber and Bretta Gereke. There are events for children, evening openings on select dates, gift and farm shops, and the opportunity to have tea in the stately Grecian Hall. (Christmas at Castle Howard runs from November 16 to January 5.)</p>

      <p>Winston Churchill spent some of his happiest times at <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/chartwell">Chartwel</a>l, retreating to his beloved estate in the Kent countryside for more than four decades. Christmas was a cherished holiday for the Churchills, giving the family of such a prominent pubic figure the chance to gather and relax away from the public eye, as Sonia Purnell recounts in her biography <i>Clementine: The Life of Mrs. Winston Churchill, </i>where Celia Sandys recalls how her grandmother created the best Christmases “she had ever seen.” On three weekends in December (December 7-December 22) you can visit <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/chartwell/lists/share-in-the-memories-of-a-churchill-family-christmas">Chartwell </a>and take in various rooms decked out for Christmas, Churchill style (many areas remain as they were when the couple and their children lived here), with trees bearing the glass and gold ornaments that Clementine liked. There’s also a Christmas market (November 21-24) and a shop with Churchill favorites like Pol Roger Champagne and 4711 Cologne, along with ornaments, accessories, artisan chocolate and even locally-made gin. After a walk in the winter gardens and around the lakes of the sprawling 80-acre property, head to a hearty (and well-priced) lunch at the estate’s restaurant, where a special brunch on Boxing Day, December 27 and New Year’s Day will also be available.</p>

      <p>If you want to add some royal luster to your holiday celebrations, head to <a href="https://www.highgrovegardens.com/">Highgrove</a>, the exquisite estate in Gloucestershire that’s home to the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. Renowned for its gardens, considered among the most innovative in the U.K. for the pioneering eco-conscious methods used when creating them, the Highgrove landscape remains beautiful, even during cold-weather months, appearing particularly magical when doused with a bit of snow. In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Highgrove-English-HRH-Prince-Wales/dp/0847845613"><i>Highgrove: An English Country Garden</i></a>, the prince, an accomplished artist, explained how he saw various parts of the garden as distinct ‘paintings,’ designing them to be of aesthetic interest, even in winter.) For the holidays, Highgrove has scheduled a number of special events, including a glamorous b<a href="https://www.highgrovegardens.com/collections/christmas-wrapped-up/products/black-tie-dinner-at-highgrove">lack-tie dinner on December 21st</a>. The evening, held in the estate’s Orchard restaurant, will include live jazz and a charity auction. On other dates, <a href="https://www.highgrovegardens.com/pages/christmas-highgrove-2019">Highgrove </a>will host holiday suppers (check for availability regarding the Christmas teas and lunches). All profits from these events and products from the <a href="https://www.highgrovegardens.com/collections/">Highgrove Shop</a> are donated to the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Fund. </p>

      <p>Built by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the 19th century, the French Renaissance-style <a href="https://waddesdon.org.uk/">Waddesdon Manor</a> quickly became one of England’s most important estates. Not only was it a repository for Rothschild’s significant art and decorative arts collections, the manor was the site of many Saturday-to-Monday (the term used before ‘weekend,’ the word that flummoxed Downton Abbey’s Lady Violet, came into use) house parties for power players of the time (even Queen Victoria stopped by). During the holidays (November 16-January 5) <a href="https://waddesdon.org.uk/whats-on/christmas/">Waddesdon</a> has a lot on offer—beautiful rooms with a seasonal decor inspired by popular Christmas music, light shows illuminating the manor’s dramatic architecture, a stunning light trail for exploring the garden, a Christmas fair and holiday pop-up shop, along with Christmas lunches and teas at the estate’s restaurant.</p>

      <p>It’s the Loire valley’s largest château with more than 400 rooms and, not surprisingly, the <a href="https://www.chambord.org/en/groups/christmas-in-chambord/">Château de Chambord,</a> whose construction began 500 years ago, does the holidays in grand style. This elaborate French Renaissance landmark—Leonardo da Vinci may have contributed to its design—served as a hunting lodge for French kings (Francis I, Louis XIV) and become the hideaway during World War II for art works from the Louvre. During the holidays (from December 1 to early January), the château and its grounds showcase a dazzling assortment of Christmas trees—at dusk more than 100 glitter in the garden and inside there are plenty more, designed by an assortment of well-known brands invited to compete for best in show. Various holiday programs are also planned, with Renaissance music, dance performances and trumpet concerts.</p>

      <p>Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte, about an hour’s drive from Paris, provides one of France’s most lavish holiday settings. Built in the 16th century by Louis XIV’s finance minister, Nicolas Fouquet, the magnificence of the chateau inspired the king’s envy (Fouquet was jailed after a royal visit to the estate), as well as the subsequent design of Versailles. Starting November 23 and running until January 5, the program “<a href="https://vaux-le-vicomte.com/en/vaux-le-vicomte-celebrate-christmas/">Vaux-le-Vicomte Celebrates Christmas</a>” does so in grand style with sumptuous holiday decor (various salons and bedchambers are toned to a particular hue, like the king’s boudoir in shades of green) and thousands of lights illuminating the boxwood and topiary in the famous Le Nôtre-designed gardens. A new sound-and-light show will play out on the château’s facade, and carriage rides can be booked in the garden.</p>

      <p>The ultimate stately home, the <a href="http://en.chateauversailles.fr/">Château de Versailles</a> glitters year-round with its grand salons awash in gilded surfaces, crystal and mirrors, making it a particularly glorious setting during the holiday season. On select dates in December the palace hosts a special evening event, <a href="https://www.chateauversailles-spectacles.fr/programmation/le-parcours-du-roi_e2135">Le Parcours du Roi</a> (The King’s Path) that showcases some of Versailles’ best-known areas—the Hall of Mirrors and Grand Apartments with dancers, singers and musicians in Baroque costumes, and Santa settled in among the Christmas trees. The tours start from 6 to 7:35 PM and last an hour. In addition to its historical significance, the Château deVersailles is a noted <a href="https://www.chateauversailles-spectacles.fr/programmation/1">cultural hub</a>, with many performances scheduled for December, including ballet (<i>Gravity </i>by<i> </i>Ballet Preljocaj), opera (Corigliano’s <i>The Ghosts of Versailles,</i> Offenbach<i>’s The Périchole</i>) and concerts like Handel’s <i>Messiah</i> on December 15, Bach’s <i>Magnificat</i> on December 20, and the Praetorius <i>Christmas Mass </i>on December 21.</p>
