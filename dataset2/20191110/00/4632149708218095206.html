      <h1>1992 to Now: Ram links &amp; cleaves Sena-BJP</h1>

      <p><i>Jury is out on whether Ayodhya will help BJP in the event of a re-election<br/></i><br/>He liked being called the Hindu Hridaya Samrat –Emperor of Hindu Hearts. And so, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray was not going to let the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) walk away with the credit of having brought down the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. <br/><br/>The demolition of the mosque was the culmination of a high-pitched rath yatra led by L K Advani, which eventually catapulted the BJP from the fringes of Indian politics into the mainstream. All the leaders present at the site when the domed structure was brought down were either BJP leaders or belonged to its associate organisations. The outfits that had led the Ram Mandir campaign – creating a frenzied atmosphere in the country in the run up to the rath yatra – were all also linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Sena or Sainiks were, at best, on the fringes. <br/><br/>But soon after the demolition, the BJP offered Thackeray what he was pining for -- on a platter. At a press conference in New Delhi, BJP vice-president Sundar Singh Bhandari claimed that no BJP worker was involved in pulling down the mosque and that the vandals were probably all Shiv Sainiks. The wily Sena chief accepted the gift without as much as a thank you to the BJP. <br/><br/>Till his last days, Thackeray did not tire of claiming that the mosque was brought down by his partymen.</p>

      <p>In the following days, as Hindu-Muslim riots broke across India, Sena got inextricably linked to December 6, 1992. Mumbai, known for decades as a melting pot of cultures and castes, was blighted by violent communal eruptions, leaving over 700 dead. As the city burned, Sena projected itself as the savior of Hindus and Thackeray as Hindutva’s patron saint. <br/><br/>The riots were followed by what was one of India’s first terrorist attacks. A series of blasts, that left over 250 dead, further polarised the city. The Sena-BJP combine won 31 out of 34 assembly seats in the city. <br/><br/>On Saturday, as the Supreme Court delivered its verdict granting Hindu outfits the entire disputed plot of land in Ayodhya to a build a temple, Shiv Sena, now led by Thackeray’s son Uddhav, must struggle once again to retain the party’s “aggressive Hindutva” credentials, if not the title of Hindu Hridaya Samrat that, many now believe, has gone to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. <br/><br/>Though it is the Supreme Court that has given the land to the Hindus, all concerned see it as a victory for the party in power at the Centre – the BJP. Modi, of course, did not waste any time to appear on prime time TV on Saturday, appealing for calm and peace. The idea wasn’t as much to ensure law and order was maintained as it was to lay claim to a victory. The attempt, perhaps, was also to ensure that his words and picture appeared on the front page of every newspaper on Sunday alongside the court verdict. <br/><br/>The timing of the SC verdict couldn’t have been worse for the Sena. Uddhav just a day before nearly severed all ties with the BJP, refusing to help it form the government. It was a bitter parting – Uddhav called Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis (now reduced to care-taking responsibilities) and Amit Shah “liars” for not honouring a 50:50 power sharing formula, which, he claimed, included a Sena CM for half the term. Fadnavis accused Uddhav of back-stabbing, referring to his “all options are open” statement the day the results were declared. <br/><br/>In the following days, reams of newsprint and hours of TV footage will be used to debate whether the court verdict will benefit the BJP electorally. An attendant question to be answered would be – will the BJP opt for a re-election and cash in on its Ayodhya success? And this will be followed by another question. Did the BJP deliberately break ties with the Sena, knowing the Ayodhya verdict was on its way? <br/><br/><br/>The Shiv Sena on its part will wonder whether the BJP will flatten everything in its way using the Ayodhya verdict if a re-election were to be held or whether the voters will punish it for not honouring a mandate to form government. Whatever may be the outcome, after 27 years Ayodhya is at the centre of the Sena-BJP partnership once again. Just this time, there is no Bal Thackeray nor an Advani, who has been pushed into retirement. What the Sena must contend with, instead, is the ultra-aggressive pairing of Modi-Shah in Delhi and a wounded adversary in Mumbai. <br/><br/>Uddhav has already fired the first shot. At a press conference on Saturday, he tried to take the credit away from Modi reminding the BJP that it was Advani who started the Ram temple movement. “I will visit Advaniji to thank him and congratulate him,” he said. Uddhav also declared that he will visit Ayodhya, where he launched his party’s 2019 Lok Sabha campaign, on November 24. <br/><br/><br/>He knows the stakes are high. This battle isn’t for a title any longer. This is a fight for survival.</p>
