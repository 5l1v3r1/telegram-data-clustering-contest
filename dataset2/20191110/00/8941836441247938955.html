      <h1>Jeff Bezos could help Redskins with new stadium: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/matthew-paras/" target="_blank">Matthew Paras</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> founder <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Jeff Bezos</a> is interested in owning an NFL team and has become close with league owners, including Washington’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-snyder/">Dan Snyder</a>, according to a new report from CBS Sports. </p>
      <p>Jason La Canfora <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-interested-in-owning-nfl-team-has-strong-support-among-current-owners/">reported</a> Sunday that “some believe” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Bezos</a> could help the Redskins’ pursuit of a new stadium, as well. </p>
      <p>“Perhaps even with an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> sponsorship,” La Canfora writes. </p>
      <p>The Redskins are in the midst of trying to build a new stadium with FedEx Field’s lease set to expire in 2027. Team president Bruce Allen said over the summer that an announcement for the new venue could come “within a year.” He said the deadline to make a decision is 2022. </p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Bezos</a>, meanwhile, is moving to the District, according to CBS Sports. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amazon/">Amazon</a> CEO has strong support from the league’s owners for purchasing a team, though no club is up for sale at the moment. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeffrey-p-bezos/">Bezos</a> has reportedly spent “considerable time” with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dan-snyder/">Snyder</a> and others. </p>
