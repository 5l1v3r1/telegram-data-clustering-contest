      <p>Wall Street and the financial media touted new all-time closing highs on Friday for the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq. Closing highs and lows are meaningless as technicians draw lines connecting all-time intraday highs which were set on Thursday, November 7. Before data feeds were seen on computer screens, intraday highs and lows were not tracked by the exchanges. Then in the mid-1980s things changed for the better when intraday highs and lows became visible on charting services seen on desk top computers.</p>
      <p>I ought to know as I was a beta tester for Market Vision’s Athena graphics, which has evolved into the graphics I use today on Refinitiv platforms. My input was used to determine what indicators must be included. One thing I insisted upon as a consultant to Market Vision and Liberty Brokerage was the need to track intraday highs and lows.</p>
      <p>Closes are used for moving averages, intraday highs and lows are used to draw trend lines and calculate momentum such as the 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading I use on my weekly charts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wall Street and financial media who ignore intraday highs and low miss important trading signals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For example, they say that the Dow and S&amp;P 500 set their closing lows on December 24, but the intraday lows occurred on December 26. They missed the technical buy signal called a “key reversal” day. These major averages set intraday lows on December 26 then closed that day above the highs of December 24, which is a buy signal I talked about when I began 2019 bullish on stocks.</p>
      <p>Now with the three major averages entering their zones of monthly and quarterly risky levels, I am telling investors to reduce holdings in the stock market by 50% just as I did in March 2000 with the Nasdaq above 5,000 and in late-2007 when I predicted the Crash of 2018. There’s nothing wrong with reducing holdings when the astute investor may have doubled or tripled their investment portfolios in 2019.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average set its all-time intraday high of 27,774.67 on November 7 with its quarterly risky level at 28,537.    </p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 set its all-time intraday high of 3,097.77 on November 7 and is above its quarterly and monthly pivots at 3,076.9 and 3,089.5, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq Composite set its all-time intraday high of 8,483.16 on November 7 in-between its monthly pivot at 8,469 and its quarterly risky level at 8,591.</p>
      <p>The Dow, S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Transports and Russell 2000 remain above their semiannual pivots at 27,266, 2,955.6, 7,999, 10.720 and 1,572.85, respectively.  </p>
      <p>All five major averages have positive weekly charts, and the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq are now overbought.</p>

          <i>How to use my value levels and risky levels:</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on Dec. 31, 2018. The original annual level remains in play.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The close at the end of June 2019 established new monthly, quarterly and semiannual levels. The semiannual level for the second half of 2019 remains in play.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The quarterly level changes after the end of each quarter so the close on September 30 established the level for the fourth quarter. The close on October 31 established the monthly level for November as monthly levels change at the end of each month.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires.</i>
