      <p>With all the discussions about GMO’s/non-GMO’s (genetically-modified foods), organic food, “natural” food and “farm to table,” we can all be rather confused about what to eat.  </p>
      <p>It’s all about the food supply, according to a fascinating woman I spoke with recently who, in the search for resolutions to her own health challenges, discovered how opaque our food supply chain really is and why that’s not good for us, the economy or the planet.</p>
      <p>“I personally have medical allergies, and have had a lot of medical issues,” Gabrielle (Ellie) Rubenstein told me, so that, “when I was able to figure out the difference between one egg and a Vital Farms egg, I don’t have an egg allergy! It turns out that I have a feed and a hormone allergy, which got me excited. Wait a second, this is great knowledge! What (else)…do I not have allergies to?”</p>

      <p>Rubenstein discovered that how exactly our food gets from its source to our plates – no matter if it’s plant-based, fish, or meat – needs some serious sunlight shed on it, literally and figuratively. She says we’d all be healthier and eating much more nutritious food, if the food supply was transparent, enabling us to make better informed choices.</p>
      <p>Nonprofit health advocate? Not. Ellie Rubenstein is an entrepreneur and investor like her famous father, <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/about-carlyle/team/david-m-rubenstein">David Rubenstein</a>, and a self-described “outdoorswoman” who hunts and fishes in Alaska for her own food like her mother.  She is the founder and CEO of Manna Partners, who decided to put her formidable energy, resources and intellect into forming Manna as “<a href="https://www.mannapartners.us/">an asset management firm</a> committed to providing consumers with a more transparent food supply chain from production to plate.”</p>
      <p>Not your typical investor, Rubenstein is focused solely on the food supply and wanted to thoroughly understand it, so she earned a Master of Science in agricultural economics at Purdue University, and talks enthusiastically about being out in the farm fields or with fishermen in her waders.</p>
      <p>Here are insights on our food supply from our conversation:</p>

      <p>·      <u>What is the food supply chain?</u> Rubenstein broke it into four “buckets”: (a) The source: The land, or fishermen and their boats; (b) Processing: “There’s nothing bad about processing,” Rubenstein insisted, “it’s where they bring the materials, so that they are able to go out” to the distributor; (c) The distribution: That is, the food manufacturer or commercial food supplier; and (d) the consumer brand: the entity that creates and packages their version of it and gets it into stores or restaurants.</p>
      <p>·      <u>What’s wrong with our food supply now</u>?:  In addition to too the food being farmed-raised with too many hormones and chemicals, the process lacks transparency and traceability, she said, and therefore, we don’t know nor can trust what we’re really eating. She said that transparency and traceability will provide visibility into the food’s path from source to plate and will build consumer trust.  For example, one of their portfolio companies, Vital Farms, she said provides a scanning code for each egg, so you can see which farm it came from, how the chicken was raised, what they were fed, and what kind of processing the egg went through.  </p>
      <p>·      <u>Are genetically-modified foods, GMO’s, good or bad</u>?: “ I think that how to feed the world in developing countries versus how do you improve the health of the food supply chain in developed countries needs to be separated,” Rubenstein emphasized. She said people have been developing more nutritious seeds for generations, so that’s nothing new, and that all options for how to get more nutrients to people in each region should be explored. “In emerging markets today, they used to all want phones; now they want to be healthier.”</p>

      <p>·      <u>What’s the impact of climate change on the food supply</u>?: “The problem isn’t that we’re running out of food,” in Rubenstein’s opinion; “the problem is there’s a mismatch of the production and where the population is.” She stressed the importance of checking the source of the knowledge and making sure that farmers and fishermen are among those sources to get the best information.</p>
      <p>·      <u>What are the latest food supply chain trends to watch</u>?: There are three trends to keep an eye on, according to Rubenstein: (a) <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/aquaculture">Aquaculture</a>, or farmed fish and seafood, which she said is a sustainable way to raise more fish especially for areas that do not have easy access to this vital protein. Disneyworld has an aquaculture demonstration in its “Living with Land” exhibit, which I  experienced earlier this year. (b) <a href="http://www.regenerativeagriculturedefinition.com/">Regenerative agriculture</a>, which focuses on maintaining the soil health and mineral content, thereby growing healthier crops, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers  and which “offers increased yields, resilience to climate instability, and higher health and vitality for farming and ranching communities.” And, (c) Blockchain, which she thinks enables greater traceability from the food’s source to your plate.</p>
      <p>One key takeaway for me from my conversation with Ellie Rubenstein is that current food labeling does not adequately tell us where the food came from, and that we need to focus on finding that out to fully understand what to eat and buy for our families.</p>
