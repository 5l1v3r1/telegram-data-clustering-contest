      <h1>The Latest: Hoyer latest in string of fill-in QBs this year</h1>

      <p>The Latest on Week 10 in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> (all times Eastern):</p>
      <p>5 p.m.</p>
      <p>With Brian Hoyer making his first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> start in more than two years, the Indianapolis Colts are the 16th club to have used multiple starting QBs this season.</p>
      <p>Hoyer stepped in for Jacoby Brissett, out with an injured left knee.</p>
      <p>Half of the league - 16 of its 32 teams - have used more than one guy behind center at the get-go of a game.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Hoyer opened Sunday’s game against the Miami Dolphins and Ryan Fitzpatrick by going 5 of 10 for 86 yards and an interception.</p>
      <p>Fitzpatrick, of course, is not the only quarterback to start for Miami this season; Josh Rosen has started for the Dolphins, too.</p>
      <p>Earlier Sunday, the Bengals went with Ryan Finley in place of the benched Andy Dalton, while the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a> used <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-driskel/">Jeff Driskel</a> instead of the injured <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matthew-stafford/">Matthew Stafford</a>. Both the Bengals and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a> lost.</p>

        <p>So much for the New Orleans Saints’ six-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>And so much for the Atlanta Falcons’ six-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>In a stunner Sunday, Grady Jarrett delivered 2½ of Atlanta’s six sacks of Drew Brees - one fewer than the Falcons’ defense had managed all season coming in - and Matt Ryan threw for a pair of TDs in a 26-9 win at New Orleans.</p>
        <p>New Orleans dropped to 7-2, while Atlanta improved to 2-7.</p>
        <p>Here are the other results in Sunday’s early games:</p>
        <p>- Ravens 49, Bengals 13</p>
        <p>- <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> 35, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> 32</p>
        <p>- Browns 19, Bills 16</p>
        <p>- Bears 20, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a> 13</p>
        <p>- Jets 34, Giants 27</p>
        <p>- Buccaneers 30, Cardinals 27</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>3:45 p.m.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Patrick Mahomes</a> not only is back for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a>, he’s making sure everyone sees just how healthy the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s reigning MVP is.</p>
        <p>Early in the fourth quarter at Tennessee, he found himself with the pocket collapsing. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a> jumped up and threw to Mecole Hardman, who ran with the pass for a 63-yard touchdown and a 29-20 lead for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a> has 379 yards passing and three touchdowns so far in his return after missing two games with a kneecap injury.</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>3:10 p.m.</p>
        <p>Lamar Jackson’s breakout season now has its signature moment.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Ravens quarterback took off on a videogame-worthy run, replete with a spin move, for a 47-yard TD in the second half against the Bengals.</p>
        <p>Defender after defender was left grasping at air as the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner made his way down the field.</p>
        <p>Jackson’s touchdown increased Baltimore’s lead to 35-10 in the road game.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>3 p.m.</p>
        <p>New Orleans receiver Tre’Quan Smith is still in the game for the Saints - somehow.</p>
        <p>Smith held onto the ball for a 13-yard gain despite being hit hard enough by Damontae Kazee that his helmet popped off.</p>
        <p>It was Smith’s first catch since Week 2. He missed five of the previous six games with an ankle injury</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>2:45 p.m.</p>
        <p>The most surprising halftime score from the early games? Without a doubt, it’s the New Orleans Saints’ 13-6 deficit at home against the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
        <p>The Saints were winners of six straight and entered 7-1, while the Falcons came into the day on a six-game losing streak and a 1-7 record.</p>
        <p>Falcons tight end Austin Hooper has the lone touchdown so far on an 8-yard pass from Matt Ryan. It was Hooper’s sixth TD catch this season.</p>
        <p>The other scores around the league after two quarters:</p>
        <p>- Ravens 28, Bengals 10</p>
        <p>- Browns 9, Bills 7</p>
        <p>- Bears 7, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a> 6</p>
        <p>- Jets 14, Giants 13</p>
        <p>- <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> 13, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> 13</p>
        <p>- Buccaneers 17, Cardinals 13</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>2:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Tennessee Titans</a> are tied with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Patrick Mahomes</a> 13-13 at halftime thanks to a big defensive touchdown by Rashaan Evans.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> led 10-7 and were driving when rookie linebacker David Long hit Damien Williams for a 3-yard loss and knocked the ball loose.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> linebacker Evans, the No. 22 pick overall out of Alabama in 2018, picked up the ball, juked out <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a> - who went down to the turf - and ran 53 yards for the score.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> right tackle Mitchell Schwartz went down with 2:46 left in the first half, snapping a streak of 7,894 consecutive snaps played that had been the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s longest active streak.</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>2:20 p.m.</p>
        <p>Giants left tackle Nate Solder has been ruled out of their game against the Jets with a concussion, leaving the team without the two tackles who had started every game this season.</p>
        <p>Right tackle Mike Remmers was ruled out before the game with a back problem.</p>
        <p>The Giants’ offensive tackles now are Nick Gates on right side, making his first career start, and Eric Smith on the left side, making his <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> debut.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>2 p.m.</p>
        <p>Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan has departed Chicago’s game against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Detroit Lions</a> with a left elbow injury.</p>
        <p>Trevathan ran off the field with his arm dangling by his side after he got hurt while trying to sack <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-driskel/">Jeff Driskel</a> in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>The 29-year-old Trevathan began the day with a team-high 67 tackles. The Bears say his return is questionable.</p>
        <p>Nick Kwiatkoski replaced Trevathan at inside linebacker.</p>
        <p>- Jay Cohen reporting in Chicago.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>1:25 p.m.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Patrick Mahomes</a> was almost picked off on his first throw back with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. Instead, he picked up right where he left off.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a> got lucky on his first play against Tennessee after missing two games with a knee injury, nearly throwing an interception.</p>
        <p>But a replay review showed that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> safety Kenny Vaccaro trapped the ball, so KC kept possession.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a> then drove the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> 69 yards over 11 plays, capping the series with a shovel pass to Travis Kelce for a 3-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a>, the reigning <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> MVP, began the game 6 of 8 for 57 yards.</p>
        <p>- Teresa M. Walker reporting in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>1:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>Kareem Hunt has his first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> touch in nearly a year following an eight-game suspension.</p>
        <p>The troubled Browns running back returned for his first action since Nov. 19 last season, when he was with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a>.</p>
        <p>The Browns signed the Cleveland native in February.</p>
        <p>He was banned for eight games by the league for two physical off-field altercations, including one when he shoved and kicked a woman.</p>
        <p>On Cleveland’s first possession against Buffalo on Sunday, Hunt caught a short pass from Baker Mayfield for a 7-yard gain.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old Hunt led the league in rushing for Kansas City in 2017.</p>

        <p>11:55 a.m.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Patrick Mahomes</a> will start for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a> at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Tennessee Titans</a>, just over two weeks after the reigning <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> MVP dislocated his kneecap.</p>
        <p>There initially was concern that the quarterback could be sidelined for months.</p>
        <p>But it turned out there was no structural damage to the knee, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-mahomes/">Mahomes</a> never missed a practice.</p>
        <p>He missed two games, with Matt Moore starting in his place.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>11:30 a.m.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matthew-stafford/">Matthew Stafford</a> has been ruled out for Detroit’s game at Chicago because of hip and back issues, stopping his streak of 136 consecutive starts.</p>
        <p>The 31-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matthew-stafford/">Stafford</a> had been listed as questionable. It’s the first time he has missed a regular-season game since the 2010 season.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-driskel/">Jeff Driskel</a> is stepping in for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matthew-stafford/">Stafford</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-driskel/">Driskel</a> is making his sixth career start.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matthew-stafford/">Stafford</a> is working on another terrific year for Detroit, throwing for 2,499 yards and 19 touchdowns in the first half of the season.</p>
        <p>The Bears had been a 2½-point favorite over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/detroit-lions/">Lions</a>, but Chicago was favored by 6½ points Sunday morning after the Stafford news broke.</p>
