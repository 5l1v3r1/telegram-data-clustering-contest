      <p>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - Indiana University has reopened the Bloomington campus’ art museum following a 3-year renovation that’s opened up some of its workings to public view.</p>
      <p>The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art reopened Thursday to the public following the extensive updates to the building’s infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Those improvements include the installation of large windows that allow museum patrons to watch conservators at work. Previously they had done their jobs hidden away inside the space.</p>
      <p>The Herald-Times reports that those windows are part of the museum’s efforts to focus on transparency and education after its $30 million renovation.</p>
      <p>The museum opened in 1982 and was closed in May 2017 for the renovation project .</p>
