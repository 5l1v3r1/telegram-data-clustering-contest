      <p>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - Wayne Simmonds and Jesper Bratt scored 22 seconds apart in the first period and Mackenzie Blackwood made 30 saves in the New Jersey Devils’ 2-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Brock Boeser had a power-play goal for Vancouver. The Canucks are 0-3-1 in their last four games.</p>
      <p>Simmonds opened the scoring on a power play with 8:12 left in the first period. Taylor Hall sent a pass into the Canucks’ zone that Kyle Palmieri directed to Simmonds. He put it past goalie Jacob Markstrom for the Devils’ second road power-play goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Bratt quickly made it 2-0 at 12:10 when he deflected Damon Severson’s point shot.</p>
      <p>Boeser scored with 7:20 left in the second. He took J.T. Miller’s pass, used his speed to skate into the Devil’s zone, then beat Blackwood with a low shot to the far corner.</p>

      <p>It was the second head-to-head brother clash between Vancouver’s Quinn Hughes, the 20-year-old defenseman picked seventh overall in the 2018 draft, and Jack Hughes, the 18-year-old center picked No. 1 by the Devils this year. In an Oct. 19 meeting, Jack Hughes scored his first NHL goal in the Devils’ 1-0 win over the Canucks. On Sunday, Quinn Hughes earned an assist on Boeser’s goal while Jack was kept off the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>NOTES: Vancouver’s Brandon Sutter played in his 701st career game. He’s the sixth member of the Sutter family to play 700 or more games. … The Devils are 8-0-3 in their last 11 games against Vancouver. … Markstrom stopped 25 shots.</p>
