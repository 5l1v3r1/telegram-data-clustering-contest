      <p>SHIGA, Japan (AP) - Overnight leader Ai Suzuki shot a bogey-free 5-under 67 on Sunday to win the Japan Classic by three strokes for her first LPGA career victory.</p>
      <p>Suzuki carded her fifth birdie of the day on the par-5 18th hole at the Seta Golf Course to finish with a 17-under 199, three shots ahead of Hyo Joo Kim (66).</p>
      <p>“This one is special because it’s a US LPGA tour event,” Suzuki said through a translator. “It’s beyond Japan, an International event.”</p>
      <p>Suzuki is the second straight Japanese winner of the Japan Classic following Nasa Hataoka. With the win, Suzuki, a regular on the JLPGA, becomes eligible for LPGA Tour membership.</p>
      <p>“It was my dream so I feel like I want to challenge,” Suzuki said. “But I can’t speak English so I need to talk to my family because I need their support.”</p>

      <p>Minjee Lee finished in third place at 11-under 205 after shooting a 68 in the final event of the LPGA Tour’s Asia Swing.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Kupcho of the United States was tied for fourth with Jin Yang of China after a 68 left her seven strokes back.</p>
      <p>“I was hitting the ball really well,” Kupcho said. “Gave myself a lot of putts. I even missed a couple, left them on the lip,” Kupcho said. “I played really well this week and I’m pretty happy with it.”</p>
      <p>Gaby Lopez, who started the final round in second place three strokes back, offset a pair of birdies with two bogeys for an even-par 72 that left her tied for sixth place with three others including two-time Japan Classic winner Shanshan Feng (70).</p>
