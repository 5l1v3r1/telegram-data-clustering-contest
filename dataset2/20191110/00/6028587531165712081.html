      <p>Epidemic is a word that’s thrown around a lot these days, from public health crises related to vaping, opioids, and even obesity. But, word choice is important here. Epidemic is a specific term which refers to the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. Surely, public health problems related to vaping, opioids, or obesity do not qualify as epidemics under this definition.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, bandying about the term epidemic for these public health problems without proper context or explanation can be misleading.</p>
      <p>Besides occasionally alarmist headlines, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/27/fear-factor-worry-alarmist-health-reporting-medical-scare-stories">media</a> sometimes portray public health problems in a vacuum.</p>
      <p>Take, for example, opioids. Media headlines often refer to an “opioid epidemic” without making it clear that there are two concurrent opioid problems in the U.S. First, there is the very large problem of illicit opioids, such as heroin, fentanyl, and counterfeit opioids, accounting at present for well over<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/21/the-myth-of-the-roots-of-the-opioid-crisis-217034"> 80% </a>of opioid-related deaths. Second, there is the problem of prescription opioid abuse, misuse, overuse, and diversion. A relatively small percentage - approximately <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1507771">8%</a> - of people who are prescribed opioids for pain develop an opioid use disorder. An even smaller number become addicted to prescription opioids.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the vast majority of those who are addicted to and die from prescription opioid overdoses obtained these medications through diversion, or sources other than legitimate prescriptions from physicians. Overall, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0033354919878429#articleShareContainer">prescription opioids</a> contribute very modestly to overdoses, and almost always in combination with other drugs, either illicit or licit. In a recently published large-scale study, only <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l5993">1.3% individuals</a> who had a fatal opioid-related overdose had an active legitimate prescription for an opioid, as shown in the toxicology reports on the date of death.</p>
      <p>Media headlines and reports often don’t delve into the complexity of the public health problems related to opioids.</p>
      <p>Then, there’s the complicated case of vaping. Dozens of people have died and thousands have come down with vaping-related pulmonary illnesses.</p>
      <p>While it’s important to report on vaping-related illnesses, nuance is crucial. In one of the first studies <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911614">published</a> on the mysterious vaping-related illness 87% of patients said they had vaped tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, from prefilled cartridges purchased from “informal sources.” The study went on to assert that additional work is needed to “characterize the pathophysiology and to identify the definitive causes.”</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1913069">publication</a> appeared to confirm the hypothesis that vaping-related illness likely stems “from one or more inhaled toxic substances,” but at the same time stated that the “pathology is poorly understood.”</p>
      <p>The very latest <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/11/08/vaping-illnesses-vitamin-e-acetate/">study</a> points to a possible role played by vitamin E acetate. The chemical is sometimes used as an additive or thickening agent in illicit vaping products, particularly those <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investigators-find-clue-to-mysterious-vaping-injuries-11573236635">containing THC</a>. Notably, federal and state health officials haven’t thus far reported finding vitamin E acetate in any of the tested nicotine products linked to the patients suffering from a vaping-related illness.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, some media headlines and reports have arguably contributed to a misinformed public. According to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/09/19/as-vaping-related-lung-illnesses-worsen-public-holds-e-cigarettes-like-juul-culpable/">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted in September 58% of respondents believed people had "died from lung disease" caused by “e-cigarettes” based on what they had “seen, read, or heard on the news lately.” Merely 34% of respondents said the cases involved “marijuana or THC e-cigarettes.” Perhaps most striking of all, only 22% of respondents understood that e-cigarettes are generally considered less hazardous than the conventional kind.</p>
      <p>The latter point has been lost in <a href="https://reason.com/2019/09/24/why-is-the-cdc-still-fostering-potentially-deadly-confusion-about-vaping-and-lung-disease/">muddled messaging</a> by the media, and also federal agencies.</p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may not be helping matters with some confused messaging of its own. The clear part of CDC’s message is that it is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6841e3.htm#clinicalcareandpublichealthrecommendations">recommending</a> that people should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC. But, the unclear part is that it is also recommending that “persons consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain nicotine.”</p>
      <p>What is a vaper, hooked onto nicotine, to do? Smoking cessation products, such as bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy are long-term options with varying degrees of effectiveness. But, in the short term, if the person is representative of the Morning Consult poll above, in which 78% of respondents believe that e-cigarettes are more dangerous than conventional cigarettes, then there’s a good chance the person will revert to smoking.</p>
      <p>A recently published review by Public Health England, the British counterpart to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, should give pause. The review concludes that vaping is 95% less dangerous than smoking. In fact, the <a href="https://www.apnews.com/3ff4e419802144998ca31ae88029457b">Royal College of Physicians</a> explicitly tells doctors to promote e-cigarettes “as widely as possible” to people trying to quit smoking.</p>
      <p>The general lack of nuance in the coverage of public health crises is a worrisome trend. Balanced reporting is preferable in which neutral language is used that captures the facts concerning these crises, and then educates the public on relative risk.</p>
