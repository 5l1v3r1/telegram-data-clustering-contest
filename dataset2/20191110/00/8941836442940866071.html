      <p>MONTREAL (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shea-weber/">Shea Weber</a> led by example for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Montreal Canadiens</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal/">Montreal</a> captain scored two power-play goals in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Canadiens</a>‘ 3-2 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-kings/">Los Angeles Kings</a> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“We know we haven’t been good enough here in the last little while,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shea-weber/">Weber</a> said. “We got to take a look in the mirror and we’ve all got to be better. I thought tonight we had a much better start and obviously you saw what a start can do.”</p>
      <p>Nate Thompson also scored and Carey Price made 31 saves. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/montreal-canadiens/">Canadiens</a> improved to 9-5-3 with their fifth victory in six games.</p>
      <p>Blake Lizotte scored his first NHL goal, Anze Kopitar also connected, and Jonathan Quick stopped 34 shots for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-kings/">Kings</a>. Los Angeles has only one victory in its last eight.</p>

      <p>“We had a good second, we had a good third,” Kopitar said. “We’ve talked about this enough so far. I mean, it’s been 16 games in. You can’t play 40 minutes, or 45, or 55. You got to fight for the full 60.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shea-weber/">Weber</a> opened the scoring midway through the first period. The defenseman fired a shot from the top of the faceoff circle that hit defenseman Matt Roy. As the puck landed back toward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shea-weber/">Weber</a>, he blasted it past Quick.</p>
      <p>“That was a weird one, definitely,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shea-weber/">Weber</a> said. “Just waiting for it to come back down. Got lucky on the timing.”</p>
      <p>Thompson made it 2-0 15 seconds later, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/shea-weber/">Weber</a> added his second in the period.</p>

        <p>“I’ve been dreaming about that one for a while,” Lizotte said. “I’ve had some good chances that haven’t gone my way but it really feels good to get that one.”</p>
