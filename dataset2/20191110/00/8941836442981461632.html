      <p>ATLANTA — A daughter of the Rev. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/martin-luther-king-jr/">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> has sent a letter to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> executives in which she accuses the company of trying to “dismantle” a law barring racial discrimination.</p>
      <p>The letter released Saturday from the Rev. Bernice King addresses a $20 billion lawsuit from comedian and media mogul Byron Allen that is headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices are scheduled to hear arguments in the case Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A lower court ruled in favor of Allen, who says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> declined to distribute his channels because he’s black.</p>
      <p>Justices are weighing whether Allen needs to show that race was just a factor in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a>’s decision or whether it was the sole factor.</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> wins, the bar will be high to bring and succeed with similar suits.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/martin-luther-king-jr/">King</a> says if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> wins, “pivotal” anti-discrimination legislation could be compromised.</p>
      <p>“Are you prepared to say business decisions based on racism are acceptable if combined with other non-racist reasons?” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/martin-luther-king-jr/">King</a> wrote to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> CEO Brian Roberts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> has said its decision not to carry Allen’s channels has nothing to do with race. It has called Allen’s content “not particularly high quality.”</p>

        <p>“We have been forced to appeal this decision to defend against a meritless $20 billion claim, but have kept our argument narrowly focused,” a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> spokesperson said in response to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/martin-luther-king-jr/">King</a>’s letter. “This case cannot detract from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a>’s strong civil rights and diversity record or our outstanding record of supporting and fostering diverse programming from African-American owned channels. There has been no finding of discriminatory conduct by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/comcast/">Comcast</a> against this plaintiff by any court, and there has been none.”</p>
