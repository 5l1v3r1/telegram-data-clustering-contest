      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Ryan Tannehill threw a 23-yard touchdown to Adam Humphries with 23 seconds left, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Tennessee Titans</a> blocked a last-second field goal attempt to beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Kansas City Chiefs</a> 35-32 to spoil the return of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> MVP Patrick Mahomes.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> (5-5) only had a chance to take the lead after a bad snap by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> on Harrison Butker’s fifth field goal attempt of the day. The snap caught holder Dustin Colquitt by surprise, and he threw the ball away in desperation for an intentional grounding call, setting the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> up at their own 39.</p>
      <p>Tannehill scrambled for 18, hit Anthony Firsker for 20 yards and then found Humphries who ran in for the TD. Tannehill also ran for the 2-point conversion for a 35-32 lead.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> (6-4) had a final chance with Mahomes. He drove them down, setting up Butker for another field goal try from 52 yards.</p>
      <p>Joshua Kalu blocked the kick with his left hand, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> poured onto the field to celebrate.</p>

      <p>Derrick Henry ran for 188 yards, including a 68-yard TD that put Tennessee up 20-19 with 5:58 left in the third. His 1-yard TD with 6:26 remaining pulled the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> within 29-27.</p>
      <p>Tannehill finished with 181 yards passing and ran for 37 yards for the win.</p>
      <p>The loss spoiled the best passing game this season for Mahomes as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> outgained the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> 530-371. Mahomes threw for 446 yards and three touchdowns. His best play came with the pocket collapsing around him when he jumped up to throw over the linemen to Mecole Hardman who ran for a 63-yard TD with 11:54 left and a 29-20 lead.</p>
      <p>Mahomes looked very healthy playing for the first time since dislocating his right kneecap Oct. 17. He got lucky when his first pass first ruled an interception was overturned by replay for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> safety Kenny Vaccaro trapping the ball on the ground. Mahomes capped the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a>‘ first drive with a 3-yard shovel pass to Travis Kelce.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> sacked Tannehill four times and also forced a fumble but could only turn that into one of Butker’s four made field goals.</p>
        <p>Tannehill got the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tennessee-titans/">Titans</a> going with a 52-yard throw to Kalif Raymond, then he hit Anthony Firkser for a 9-yard TD. Then rookie linebacker David Long forced a fumble by Damien Williams, and linebacker Rashaan Evans picked up the ball, juked away from Mahomes and ran 53 yards for a TD and a 13-10 lead with 6:14 left in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>INJURIES</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kansas-city-chiefs/">Chiefs</a> came in with left tackle Eric Fisher still healing up from a groin injury that has kept him out all but the first two games of the season, and right guard Laurent Durvernay-Tardif missing a second game with an ankle. Late in the first half, Kansas City lost an offensive lineman on consecutive plays. First, right tackle Mitchell Schwartz hurt a knee and went to the sideline, snapping the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s longest active snap streak at 7,894 snaps. Then Martinas Rankin, who started at right guard, moved over a spot and hurt his right knee on the next play. He was carted to the locker room and did not return.</p>
