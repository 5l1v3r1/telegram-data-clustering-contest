      <p>WITHIN a span of only two weeks in October, three strong tremors shook most of the central, eastern and northern sections of Mindanao, with tremors that could reach intensity 7, in what the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) described as probably the most destructive string of quakes to jolt the South in recent history.</p>
      <p>And indeed it was.</p>
      <p>A quarter of a million residents, or 254,474, were rattled, dazed and traumatized, and 39,128 persons opted to sleep and find refuge in tents and makeshift structures than get trapped on the next unpredictable ground-shaking.</p>

        <figcaption>Rescue workers assess the damage to a residential condominium building that partially collapsed after a strong earthquake in Davao City on October 31, 2019. The third strong earthquake this month jolted the southern Philippines on Thursday morning, further damaging structures already weakened by the earlier shaking.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Twenty-two persons died, 417 injured and two were reported missing in four regions.</p>
      <p>The temblor has so far rendered inhabitable, or dangerously standing, some 34,583 houses, which comprised 95.99 percent of all damaged infrastructure in five regions.</p>
      <p>Response, while quick in coming from even among the affected, may not be totally comforting and assuring. With aftershocks coming in streams, with periodic magnitudes of over 4—while in the category of moderate ground shaking —may further trigger more destruction of weakened structures, especially when the quake occurs from shallow depths.</p>
      <h3>Not yet in the recovery phase</h3>
      <p>Secretary Emmanuel F. Piñol, chief of the government’s socioeconomic planning unit for Mindanao, said the responses were not yet at the level of recovery for the hard-hit areas.</p>
      <p>Although areas like M’lang, and the epicenter town of Tulunan in North Cotabato, and Digos City and the towns of Bansalan and battered Magsaysay towns of Davao del Sur may be able to recover immediately, he said the entire affected regions could not proceed with serious recovery and rehabilitation efforts.</p>
      <p>“We are not even near the recovery stage yet because of the uncertainties and fear that there could be more tremors,” Piñol told the BusinessMirror in an exchange of mobile-phone text messages on Thursday. “The areas are still awaiting the Phivolcs [Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology] assessment on the danger zones.”</p>
      <p>In its situation report as of Thursday, and in its October 29 primer on the day the second, 6.6-magnitude quake occurred, the Phivolcs said “small- to moderate- magnitude earthquakes [are expected] to occur in the epicentral area which may continue for several days to weeks,</p>
      <p>“Although the occurrence of another earthquake higher than [magnitude 6.6] cannot be discounted, the possibility of it coming from the same source area is low,” the agency said.</p>
      <p>Even if no succeeding ground shaking were felt, Piñol said other hard-hit areas were expected to be on a slow road to recovery. These would be the towns of Magpet, Kidapawan and Makilala, all to the northeast of Tulunan town, from where the three strong quakes occurred at shallow depth of focus: 9 kilometers (of the October 16, magnitude 6.3), 7 km (of the October 29, magnitude 6.6) and 8 km  (of the October 31 magnitude 6.5).</p>
      <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said temblors of magnitude 6.3 and over are considered strong quakes, and could generate high intensity at shallow depths.</p>
      <p>The Phivolcs said a destructive intensity 7 was felt in these towns where damage was enormous, including the collapse of Eva’s Hotel in Kidapawan City, and the gymnasium in Barangay Batasan in Makilala town, both on October 31. One evacuee was killed in the latter, where many other families were seeking refuge after the October 29 quake.</p>
      <p>Landslides in mountain areas also occurred and families were evacuated.</p>
      <p>Piñol said several urban areas in Magpet, Kidapawan and Makilala were also declared no-go zones and families were evacuated.</p>
      <p>The MinDA has already established a disaster command center to centralize and coordinate all relief efforts, to avoid untoward incidents, such as a food-poisoning incident when 18 evacuees in a center in Barangay Malabuan, Makilala, were treated in a hospital after private donors distributed food.</p>
      <p>Several individuals in a pickup van were mobbed by hungry evacuees in Barangay Malasila in Makilala, though authorities said no one was hurt, according to a report by the Davao City-based Mindanews, which witnessed the incident.</p>
      <p>Piñol, however, appeared to be apprehensive though, with the unpreparedness of certain areas to cope with a disaster of such magnitude.</p>
      <h3>Unpreparedness, psychological tension</h3>
      <p>“The disaster showed that many local government units, in spite of their huge calamity funds, are ill-prepared for emergency situations,” he said, and cited Kidapawan City as a case.</p>
      <p>Piñol said the city “prides itself as the city of highland springs but had to ask for water support from other areas when its water pipes were busted by the earthquake.”</p>
      <p>“There should have been a pre-identified backup water source based on a worst-case scenario. This calls for the upgrading of disaster preparedness for LGUs, especially those located in high-risk areas like earthquake faults,” he added.</p>
      <p>The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said the Metro Kidapawan Water District reported, as of Thursday, that only 26.5 percent of the total consumers of the city, including its other service areas of Makilala City, Makilala and Magpet, have water supply. It has set up water rationing centers, along with the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Philippine Red Cross.</p>
      <p>A resident of Kidapawan said many other residents who have access to water have offered their water connections. “People come in droves, bringing 5-liter gallons and other containers,” she told a relative in Davao City.</p>
      <p>Piñol said there must be a ground commander to coordinate all efforts, especially since efforts to maintain relief operations, relocate the communities and rebuild lives would have to start.</p>
      <p>“What should also be given focus [are] the psychosocial and sanitation interventions,” he added.</p>
      <p>Accounts from many residents in Kidapawan City and Makilala, and in Magsaysay town of Davao del Sur, said “people take a bath with clothes on, and they make sure that doors are open when they sleep.”</p>
      <p>“No one is sleeping in their rooms anymore. Everyone, family members, neighbors, sleep in tents, or in the sala or in the terrace, where they can run,” a former local news reporter said.</p>
      <p>Everyone would be sharing about “a queer but funny feeling that there seems to be an earthquake. People would suddenly stop, eyes gazing and try to figure out if the ground was really shaking. Funny, that most often, it’s our knees that are occasionally shaking,” the former scribe said.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know what’s really happening. There might have been an aftershock after all,” a city hall officer in Davao City said.</p>
      <h3>Setback, forecast</h3>
      <p>Adrian Tamayo, an economist and former sociopolitical analyst before he worked with the MinDA, told the BusinessMirror that the gross domestic regional product would be directly affected as consumption pattern and spending change, and industries could not operate.</p>
      <p>But the impact is not seen to be widespread enough as to affect the entire island of Mindanao. Even in the affected areas, “it’s just good that the incident happened during the last quarter when industries and corporations have already prepositioned their forecast, mostly on expansion plans.”</p>
      <p>“The expansion plan may have to be waived, but with prepositioned stocks, relief goods have been easily available and have been mostly the source of the immediate relief supply for the affected areas,” Tamayo said.</p>
      <p>Thus, he said, “this reduced panic to buy and hoard, that could hyper-inflate the local economies. All other things constant, they actually are helping normalize the already difficult and chaotic situation.”</p>
      <p>“Had it happened during the lean months, like between April and June, the lack of supply and difficulty to purchase or access the goods would likely have inflationary impact, as local suppliers would jack up prices, and prices prevailing would be already high,” Tamayo said.</p>
      <p>The immediate and adverse impact was expected to be absorbed by the real-estate sector because of the magnitude of infrastructure damage, and the pre-purchases made by contractors and developers.</p>
      <p>“Between now and December, the concentration would be on relief operation and damage assessment activities,” he added.</p>
      <p>But by the second quarter of next year, the construction sector would retake its position as the driver of the local economies as the construction frenzy to rebuild or repair damaged houses and buildings gets under way.</p>
      <p>“By then, what people lost in jobs and livelihood because of the earthquake would have the opportunity to be offset by the jobs to be needed in construction alone,” he said.</p>
      <p>“With construction and the repair of roads, bridges, government buildings and other infrastructure, business and industries are expected to come back and resume normal operation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It would also demonstrate how resilient our people are,” Tamayo said.</p>
