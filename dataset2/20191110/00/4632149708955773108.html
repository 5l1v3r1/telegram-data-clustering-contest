      <p>Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is all set to begin weeding of 20 lakes soon. At a recent meeting chaired by Chief Minsiter BS Yediyurappa, it was announced that BBMP will take over all the city lakes except Bellandur and Varthur that are being developed by Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). Shortly after the announcement, BBMP has already planned to weed the lakes. <br/><br/>Among several measures, BBMP has planned to provide walk paths, maintain sewage treatment plants (STPs) at all lakes and provide safety measures for residents at the lakes. The CM had also directed officials to remove all encroachments from the lake. A senior BBMP official says, “To start with, we are now taking up weeding of the water body and the wetland and cleaning of inlets of the lakes. The work will be taken up at the cost of Rs 1.86 crore.” <br/><br/>Several lakes in the city have been dying a slow death due to presence of excessive weed. Recently it was reported Doddanekundi Lake was so full of weeds that it could hardly hold any water. BBMP officials had said that they were awaiting funds. Sadaramangala Lake, in Hoodi ward, which is one of the lakes to be taken up for weeding had recently been desilted and cleaned by BBMP. BBMP had started the restoration of the lake in 2017 but had never completed it on time. Though few works were taken up, the fencing still remains to be completed by BDA. The lake still awaits an STP. <br/><br/><br/>However, this is a new plan for our lakes. Along with weeding, BBMP will take up detailed survey of the buffer zones of lakes. Recently, tenders were called for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the existing boundaries and buffer zones, identification of structures within the buffer zones, with details of ownership, fixing up of 75 boundary pillars, 20 information boards in buffer zones for every 50 m intervals around the periphery of Agara, Bellandur and Varthur Lake in 6 months. <br/><br/><b>Lakes to be weeding<br/></b><br/><br/>Sheelavathana Lake, Garudacharpalya Lake, Sitharampalya Lake, Doddanekundi Lake, Bhoganahalli Lake, Panathur Lake, Anjanapura Lake, Chunchaghatta Lake, Kothanur Lake, Devarakere Lake, Gottigere Lake, Begur Lake, Horamavu Agara Lake, Bhattarahalli Lake, Sadaramangala Lake, Hoodi Lake, Subramanyapura Lake, Singapura Lake, Ulsoor Lake and Allalasandra Lake.</p>
