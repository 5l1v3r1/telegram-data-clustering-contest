      <p>Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte should suspend his drug war and visit Finland. That’s where he can learn about peaceful ways of bringing calm and safety to a nation’s cities and towns. </p>
      <p>Public safety is an important factor for doing business in emerging markets and attract foreign capital.</p>
      <p>That’s something the Philippines needs to help deploy its human and non-human resources efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p>It also needs foreign capital — to help finance Duterte’s Build, Build, Build campaign, as China doesn’t seem to be up to the pledge it made back in 2016. Finance Philippine infrastructure projects that is.</p>
      <p> President Duterte has made city street safety a central issue of his administration. That’s why he launched a drug war, fighting fire with fire in the country’s streets. But his harsh tactics haven’t worked, thus far. In spite of thousands of lives lost, Philippines has gotten less safe in recent years. </p>
      <p>That’s according the 2019 Global Competitiveness report, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth">published</a> by the World Economic Forum (WEF). </p>
      <p>By competitiveness, WEF means the attributes and qualities of an economy that allow for a more efficient use of its human and non-human resources. The  report rated the Philippines 64 out of the 141 countries, down eight positions from last year’s ranking. </p>
      <p>It also ranked Philippines far worse in “organized crime” metric in 2019, down from 89 in 2018 to the 114<sup>th</sup> position; and 126th in “reliability of police” metric, down from 110. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, net foreign direct investment into the Philippines declined by 41.4% year-on-year to $0.54 billion dollars in July 2019 from $0.93 billion a year earlier, according to <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/philippines/indicators">Tradingeconomics</a>.com. Net equity capital investments dropped to USD $0.10 billion from $0.26 billion in the same month a year ago. </p>
      <p>Apparently, President Duterte’s violent tactics in trying to keep cities safe do not work. They must be replaced with social policies that address the source of the problem: the failure of the country’s institutions. </p>
      <p>That’s why he should visit Finland, a country which ranks number 1 in the “security” metric in the 2019 Global Competitiveness report; and number 1 in both “organized crime’ fighting and ‘reliability” sub-metrics within this metric. </p>
      <p>Finland also takes the top marks in other institutional metrics. When it comes to property rights and checks and balances, it is ranked number 1 – and the Scandinavian nation has earned positions of #2 in public sector performance; #3 in transparency; and #11 in quality of land administration. </p>
      <p>These are all areas where the Philippines receives very low marks (#85 in transparency and #75 in property rights). </p>
      <p>To be fair, Finland is a developed country ,while the Philippines is an emerging market country.</p>
      <p>But it’s about time for the Philippines to look up to developed countries as role models for its future, rather than looking complacently at how its low rankings compare to other emerging market countries.</p>
