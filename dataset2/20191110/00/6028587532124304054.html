      <p>The Green Bay Packers are coming off their worst performance of the 2019 season.The Carolina Panthers have won five of six games since starting the year 0-2.</p>
      <p>These teams, who both hope to play meaningful football in January, meet Sunday at 3:25 p.m. CST at Lambeau Field. Green Bay, which was shellacked by the Los Angeles Chargers one week ago, is a 5.5-point favorite.</p>
      <p>“We know the team that we’re about to play, they’re as good as anybody,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Friday. “And so, we’re going to have to bring our best.”</p>
      <p>Here’s a look at each positional group and which team has the edge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>QUARTERBACKS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers is having a solid year, with 17 touchdowns, two interceptions and a 104.4 passer rating. But in a 26-11 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers last week, Rodgers looked more like the player who struggled from mid-2015 through 2018. </p>
      <p>“After a rough (game) like (last) Sunday, you might spend a little extra time on it just to see if there's anything fundamentally footwork-wise, eye discipline that you can really hone in on, work in on,” Rodgers said. “But I think we took a really hard look at that one and pushed past it. But it didn't go without a lot of correction.”</p>
      <p>Carolina placed Cam Newton, the No. 1 pick in the 2011 draft and arguably the best player in franchise history, on injured reserve with a foot injury Tuesday. The 30-year-old Newton, who has one year left on his contract and is scheduled to count $21.1 million against the 2020 salary cap, has likely taken his last snap for Carolina.</p>
      <p>The Panthers have gotten a jolt from undrafted, second-year quarterback Kyle Allen, who is 5-1 this season. Allen, primarily a game manager at this stage of his career, has a passer rating of 87.8 with nine touchdowns, four interceptions and a completion percentage of 60.7.</p>
      <p>“I have, to be very honest with you,” Panthers coach Ron Rivera said. “It’s one of those things that sometimes you watch a guy and you see a guy do things and you say, ‘Wow, this guy’s got a chance.’ But it’s not just all about Kyle. We’ve been able to protect him, we’ve been able to run the ball effectively, we’ve been able to distribute the ball to the different playmakers we have.”</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Packers</p>
      <p>
        <b>RUNNING BACKS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carolina’s Christian McCaffrey is having a brilliant season and is among the MVP frontrunners.</p>
      <p>McCaffrey leads the league in total touchdowns (13), as well as yards from scrimmage (1,244). McCaffrey is second in rushing yards (881), just 13 behind NFL leader Dalvin Cook of Minnesota. McCaffrey also leads Carolina with 42 receptions.</p>
      <p>McCaffrey, the son of former Denver Broncos standout Ed McCaffrey, is on pace for a remarkable 414 touches this season. The Panthers will feed McCaffrey early and often in both the run and pass game, believing he’s their best chance to victory every week.</p>
      <p>Green Bay has two high-level backs in Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams. For some reason, though, Packers head coach Matt LaFleur forgot about them both last week and gave them just 10 combined carries.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to get those guys going,” Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said of Williams and Jones. “We need to get them the touches. We’ve got to get Aaron 15-20 touches and Jamaal 10-15 touches. I think that’s when we’re playing at our best.”</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Panthers</p>
      <p>
        <b>RECEIVERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Panthers second-year man D.J. Moore is on the rise and on pace for 90 receptions and 1,128 yards this season. Moore, a first-round draft choice in 2018, runs extremely well (4.42), but lacks ideal size (6-0, 210).</p>
      <p>Third-year player Curtis Samuel, a second-round pick in 2017, is having his best season (30-407-3). Samuel is a burner (4.31) who is still learning the wide receiver position after being used in a plethora of roles at Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Veteran tight end Greg Olsen will garner Hall of Fame consideration one day. Olsen has 682 career receptions, more than 8,000 receiving yards and 59 touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Olsen, 34, has declined a bit, but is still on pace for 54 catches and 662 receiving yards. It’s almost unfathomable that Chicago dumped him nine years ago for a mid-round draft pick.</p>
      <p>Packers Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams had seven receptions last week. The rest of the wideouts combined for just five, though, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling was shutout.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Even</p>
      <p>
        <b>OFFENSIVE LINE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Panthers have played reasonably well up front despite early-season injuries. Now, Carolina is getting healthier and could be formidable down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Pro Bowl right guard Trai Turner is back after missing a month with an ankle injury. Center Matt Paradis, who signed in free agency in March, was the NFL’s No. 2 rated center in both 2016 and 2018 by Pro Football Focus.</p>
      <p>Left tackle Daryl Williams, who suffered a dislocated right kneecap and injured an MCL during training camp in 2018, has made an impressive return. Taylor Moton has settled in at right tackle after bouncing around the line his first two years. And Greg Van Roten, a Packer in 2012-’13, has turned himself into a respectable starter and has played every snap at left guard since the start of 2018.</p>
      <p>Green Bay’s offensive line was one of the best in football the first seven games of the season. But things haven’t gone nearly as well the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>The Packers allowed five sacks to Kansas City in Week 8. And against the Chargers last week, Aaron Rodgers was sacked three times.</p>
      <p>“All you can go back to is how you prepare and I think specifically that group, the offensive line, has done a great job all week,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “Now you’ve got to go out and play.”</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Packers</p>
      <p>
        <b>DEFENSIVE LINE</b>
      </p>
      <p>After ranking just 27<sup>th</sup> in sacks last season, the Panthers’ overhauled their pass rushing unit last offseason and today lead the league with 34.0 sacks. Carolina, which played a 4-3 base throughout Rivera’s tenure, now incorporate far more 3-4 elements in their front.</p>
      <p>End Gerald McCoy, a six-time Pro Bowler with Tampa Bay, was signed in June after the Buccaneers released him. McCoy, the third overall pick in the 2010 draft, is a complete end who can still wreak havoc.</p>
      <p>Nose tackle Dontari Poe, a two-time Pro Bowler with Kansas City earlier this decade, has been more active in 2019 after a disappointing 2018. End Vernon Butler, who has three forced fumbles and three sacks in just four games, is questionable with a back injury.</p>
      <p>Green Bay’s front continues to struggle, especially in the run game.</p>
      <p>The Chargers entered last week’s game averaging just 69.5 rushing yards per game, then gashed Green Bay for 160 rushing yards and 4.44 yards per carry. Green Bay now ranks 24<sup>th</sup> in rushing yards allowed per game (127.7) and 22<sup>nd</sup> in rushing yards allowed per play (4.7).</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Panthers</p>
      <p>
        <b>LINEBACKERS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carolina’s group is terrific.</p>
      <p>Right inside linebacker Luke Kuechly is smart, cerebral, instinctive and arguably the NFL’s best player at his position.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to be smart about what colors are live, what colors are dummy colors and same with your calls and your code words,” Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “He’s been doing it for a while at a high level and been an All-Pro. He’s an impact player in both the run game and covering guys. He can do it all.”</p>
      <p>Fellow inside linebacker Shaq Thompson runs sideline to sideline, gets after quarterbacks (3.0 sacks) and is a sure tackler (68).</p>
      <p>Veteran defensive end Bruce Irvin is versatile, can line up in 4-3 and 3-4 looks and has 3.5 sacks. Outside linebacker Mario Addison, a free agent in March, leads the team in sacks (6.5) and is setting himself up for a big pay day.</p>
      <p>Rookie end Brian Burns, taken four picks after Green Bay selected Rashan Gary, is off to a solid start with 4.5 sacks. Gary, on the other hand, has had little impact and has notched just one sack.</p>
      <p>Green Bay inside linebacker Blake Martinez is playing with a club on his right hand and admits it can be problematic.</p>
      <p>“That’s just something you’ve got to work through, I think,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “And the more you get accustomed to it, the better you’re going to feel about what you’re doing.”</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Panthers</p>
      <p>
        <b>SECONDARY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carolina ranks ninth in passing yards allowed per game (227.0), while Green Bay ranks 21<sup>st</sup> (255.2). The Panthers also rank fourth in opponent quarterback rating (77.5), while the Packers are ninth (88.8).</p>
      <p>Panthers’ No. 1 cornerback James Bradberry is questionable with a groin injury, though. If he can’t go, there’s a significant dropoff.</p>
      <p>Fellow cornerback Donte Jackson is a rising player, but led all cornerbacks in missed tackles in 2018. Ex-49er Eric Reid has developed into one of the league’s better strong safeties and signed a three-year extension last offseason. Free safety Tre Boston is on his fourth team in four years, but has helped solidify the Panthers’ secondary.</p>
      <p>Packers’ second-year corner Jaire Alexander must up his game. Alexander has gambled too often and lost in what’s become a disappointing second season.</p>
      <p>Rookie safety Darnell Savage was off to a terrific start, then missed two games and part of a third with an ankle injury. Savage returned two weeks ago, but has had minimal impact.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Even</p>
      <p>
        <b>SPECIAL TEAMS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Green Bay’s special teams have been a disaster for years now. And that unit killed the Packers again last week.</p>
      <p>Midway through the third quarter, Los Angeles rookie Drue Tranquill blocked JK Scott’s punt to set up a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Then with 10 ½ minutes left, Los Angeles’ Michael Badgley kicked a 19-yard field goal on a fourth-and-goal from the 1. Green Bay’s Tony Brown was off sides on the play, though, the Chargers accepted the penalty and scored another touchdown on the ensuing play.</p>
      <p>On top of that, the Packers are averaging minus-1.3 yards per punt return in 2019.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, that’s football,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “So, I mean, yeah, we’re always trying to do the best we can in all areas. There’s no doubt about it. but these guys on the other side get paid too, and that is reality. We’ve got to do a better job absolutely. I’m not making excuses for our guys. We have got to coach better, and we’ve got to play better. Bottom line.”</p>
      <p>Panthers rookie kicker Joey Slye made 10-of-11 field goals to start the year, but just 5-of-10 since. He could be out of a job soon. Punter Michael Palardy ranks 16<sup>th</sup> in average (46.3) and 21<sup>st</sup> in net (41.5). The return games have been poor.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Panthers</p>
      <p>
        <b>COACHING</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carolina’s Ron Rivera is in his ninth season and has compiled a 76-59-1 record. Rivera has led the Panthers to the playoffs four times in his first eight years, including a loss to Denver in Super Bowl 50.</p>
      <p>Rivera, a former Chicago Bears linebacker, took over the defense this season, although Eric Washington still has the title of defensive coordinator. Norv Turner, 67, who was a head coach of the San Diego Chargers from 2007-’12 and the Oakland Raiders in 2004-‘05, runs the offense.</p>
      <p>Packers rookie head coach Matt LaFleur admitted his team didn't handle its trip to Los Angeles very well a week ago. It’s important LaFleur gets the Packers headed in the right direction before the bye week.</p>
      <p><b>ADVANTAGE:</b> Panthers</p>
      <p><b>Prediction:</b> Packers 27, Panthers 20</p>
