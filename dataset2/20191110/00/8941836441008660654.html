      <p>TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/federal-bureau-of-investigation/">FBI</a> has identified a second suspect in the theft of a Brink’s armored vehicle last month in Tempe.</p>
      <p>They say a warrant has been issued for the arrest of 20-year-old Juan Carlos Ramirez on charges of theft and conspiracy to commit theft.</p>
      <p>The armored vehicle was taken from outside a Costco store on Oct. 27. It was later found nearby, but money was missing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/brink-s/">Brinks</a> is offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Ramirez and up to $25,000 for information leading to the recovery of all the stolen money.</p>
      <p>A man previously identified as a suspect in the case - 23-year-old Edwin “Johnny” Jobany Villa - was arrested Tuesday.</p>
