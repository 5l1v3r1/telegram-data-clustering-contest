      <p>As soon as the Federal Reserve announced it was through with lowering short-term rates, Wall Street sold its bets on more rate reductions. “Poof” went the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp">inverted yield curve</a>, thus proving that “recession” had nothing to do with it. The graph below shows the effects of Wall Street’s speculations: First, pushing yields up in anticipation of Fed increases, then pushing them down when expectations turned to decreases.</p>

        <b>Now what?</b>
      </p>
      <p>With the return of a positive-slope yield curve, perhaps a form of “normality” has returned.</p>

      <p>However, the changes happened too fast for a full adjustment. While Wall Street is efficient at making instant trades, not so for investors (both institutional and individual). The latter need time to digest 180-turnabouts.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, the popular beliefs were recession ahead, too-low inflation, falling consumer confidence, weakening corporate results and tariff-trade wars. Adding up all that negativity produced expectations of further Fed rate cuts and high risk from holding stocks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reality strikes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Instead, earnings reports are good, stocks are rising, consumer confidence is retracing its drop and the Federal Reserve says not to expect any further cuts because conditions look fine.</p>
      <p>Therefore, stocks are acceptable again, but they have risen into new high territory. As a result, investors now wonder if they should jump in or wait. Likely, they are taking the latter approach, either by decision or by indecision.</p>
      <p>And that brings up bonds. Look at that 10-year US Treasury bond yield of below 2%. That means it is at best breaking even on a “real” (inflation-adjusted) basis. Based on the bond’s yield over the past ten years of Fed-controlled low rates, that level is too low. Taking on the risk of a ten-year commitment in order to earn a real 0% (ignoring any tax effect) when economic and business conditions are fine just isn’t right. Therefore, there appears to be risk without an appropriate return from holding bonds at this time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But selling bonds means needing to put the proceeds somewhere else</b>
      </p>
      <p>Short-term investments now earn above 0%, so the income reduction is not as onerous as before, plus the risk of capital losses is reduced.</p>
      <p>As to stocks – while the market is in all-time high territory, it has only just broken out of an almost two-year “pause.” Importantly for income investors, there are high quality stocks that offer good dividend yields. (Of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial stocks, 21 have yields over 2%.)</p>
      <p>And that brings up the possibility of a widespread investor action that was popularly anticipated in 2013: the “Great Rotation.” When bond prices stopped rising and the economy was doing well, the reasoning went, investors would move out of their low-yielding bonds into stocks offering good return potential. The theory petered out back then (as do most popular beliefs), so now would be the perfect time to occur – when nobody is talking about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The bottom line</b>
      </p>
      <p>The no-longer-inverted yield curve and the other recent developments are significant and potentially rewarding – <i>if </i>investors take action.</p>
      <p>It can seem like a spin in the barrel, but that is investing. From own bonds and avoid stocks to own stocks and avoid bonds. Really? Yes!</p>
