      <p>KSI got the victory over fellow YouTube sensation turned professional boxer on Saturday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. KSI took the split decision as two of the three judges scored the fight in his favor. One judge scored it 56-55 and another 57-54. A third judge saw it in Paul’s favor 56-55. Here’s how Twitter reacted to the fight:</p>
      <p>If you’re wondering why there was no real boxing analysis provided by the boxing community, it’s because the bout didn’t feature any <i>real</i> boxing.</p>
      <p>The fight was wild, though a touch more refined than the amateur scrap the two men had in England in 2018 that ended in a draw. The wildness led to a controversial two-point deduction after Paul held KSI behind the head, and hit him while he was down. Paul had dropped the popular UK YouTuber with a sound uppercut initially, but seconds later the grabbing and late punch caused the penalty.</p>
      <p>Referee Jack Reiss was excessive with his penalty of two points. If anything, Paul should have only been penalized one point. A warning might have even been acceptable. That wasn’t the only bit of controversy in the six-round bout. In the third round, KSI hit Paul behind the ear with one of his wild right hands. Paul dropped to a knee and looked to try to grapple KSI’s legs. He was a little out of sorts from the punch, but Reiss wrongly called it a push, and KSI didn’t get credit for the knockdown.</p>
      <p>When you consider the two errors from Reiss wound up canceling the other out, the scores seem more legitimate. Even if Paul had an extra point taken away, he was spared the automatic point deduction he should have had from the third-round knockdown.</p>
      <p>To put it plainly, the right man got the decision. KSI was the aggressor most of the fight. His punches weren’t accurate, but he dictated the pace and kept Paul on his back foot throughout the fight. Paul’s jab was his best weapon, but he didn’t use it enough. He also neglected to throw the uppercut with enough frequency.</p>
      <p>After the fight, Paul expressed an interest in a third fight, but KSI refused.</p>
      <p>Instead, he suggested Paul get into MMA and perhaps challenge former WWE Superstar and UFC competitor CM Punk to a fight. Paul, who was trained by former heavyweight champion Shannon Briggs, says he wants to continue to box. We’ll see what comes of his next journey into the ring.</p>
      <p>The crowd was loud and into the bout throughout. However, it was not a normal fight crowd. I recognized dozens of YouTubers near the ringside area, and other celebrities such as Justin Bieber were on hand. However, DAZN cameras didn’t find any of the normal faces you see at a big-time bout with established professionals in the ring. While the event didn’t draw boxing purists, you can’t help but wonder if the popularity of this event will create more celebrity boxing in the near future. Time and money will tell.</p>
