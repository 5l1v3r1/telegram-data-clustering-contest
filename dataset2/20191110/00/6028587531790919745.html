      <p>Most American travelers have been to Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane, but how many can say they’ve ventured up to Darwin, Australia’s northernmost city? With roughly 140,000 people, it’s the largest city in the Northern Territory and one of the most culturally diverse in the country between the sizeable indigenous population and all the folks from Australian, European, Southeast Asian, Chinese and Indian backgrounds who call it home. In other words, the food here is fantastic, but more on that later.Considering Darwin is so far from Australia’s other major metropolises, it’s still easy to reach by air thanks to nonstop hops from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Cairns, Alice Springs and Perth via Virgin Australia, Qantas, Jetstar Airways, Tigerair Australia and regional airlines like Airnorth—you can also fly in directly from Singapore, Bali or Shenzhen. Whether you’re visiting for a few days or using it as a base to begin an epic road trip through the Australian Outback, here’s why Darwin deserves a spot on your travel bucket list.</p>
      <h3>There’s Plenty To See And Do Downtown</h3>

      <p>There’s no shortage of live music venues in Darwin’s Central Business District, or CBD. Start at <a href="https://shenannigans.com.au/">Shenanigans</a>, Darwin’s quintessential Irish pub on Mitchell Street, and walk toward the Waterfront side of town. You’ll pass a multitude of craft breweries, bars, restaurants, and night clubs — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sixtanks/">Six Tanks Brew Co</a>., <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thetapdarwin/?rf=205899069478076">The Tap on Mitchell</a>, <a href="https://www.wisdombar.com.au/">Wisdom Bar &amp; Cafe</a>, and <a href="https://monsoonsdarwin.com.au/">Monsoons</a> are local favorites, as are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheLostArc/">The Lost Arc</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DiscoveryDarwin/">Discovery</a>, located a block over on the other side of Shenanigan’s. A few streets away, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/THROBNIGHTCLUB/">Throb Nightclub</a>, Darwin’s only LGBTQ bar, hosts amazing drag shows on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
      <p>Darwin’s also home to a burgeoning foodie scene, with a delicious mix of seafood, Greek, Italian, Indian, Middle Eastern, and Asian fare on offer. <a href="https://www.hanuman.com.au/darwin/home">Hanuman</a> features a menu of Thai, Malaysian, and Indian delicacies, while <a href="http://www.manolisgreektaverna.com.au/">Manoli’s Greek Taverna</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Stonehousedarwin/">Stone House Wine Bar &amp; Kitchen</a> are all about old-world European charm and tapas-bar-style elegance. <a href="http://littlemisskorea.com/">Little Miss Korea</a> is known for its creative, modern twists on Korean BBQ dishes, while <a href="http://wharfone.com.au/">Wharf One Food &amp; Wine</a> and <a href="https://www.crustaceans.net.au/">Crustaceans on the Wharf</a> remain crowd favorites near the Darwin Waterfront.

      <p>During the day, head to the Darwin Waterfront and cool off in the calm, croc-free waters of the <a href="https://www.waterfront.nt.gov.au/darwin-waterfront-precinct/water-recreation/wave-lagoon/">Darwin Wave Lagoon</a> or go for a swim next door at the Recreation Lagoon, where you can sunbathe alongside the locals. After watching a perfect Top End sunset from your perch along the Esplanade, catch a movie under the stars at <a href="https://www.deckchaircinema.com/">Deckchair Cinema</a> — just keep your food on your lap so the possums don’t grab it!</p>

        <figcaption>DARWIN, AUSTRALIA - JULY 01: A stall holder at Mindil Beach sunset markets blows bubbles as the ... [+] crowd passes during Territory Day celebrations on July 1, 2018 in Darwin, Australia. Every year on July 1, Northern Territorians celebrate self-governance. It is the only day of the year pyrotechnics are allowed to be sold to the public, with locals allowed to set off fireworks between 6pm and 11pm. The only restriction is that fireworks must not be used at Territory Day community events, and the noise they emit must not exceed 115 decibels.

      <p>Remember that amazing array of international food I mentioned? You can find it at many of Darwin’s markets, the largest being in <a href="https://mindil.com.au/">Mindil Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Parapvillagemarket/">Parap Village</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nightcliff-Markets-164673453567229/">Nightcliff</a> and <a href="https://rapidcreekmarkets.com.au/">Rapid Creek</a>. Opening dates and times vary, so check their websites before you go.</p>
      <p>Try your luck at Mindil Beach Casino Resort or head to <a href="https://www.mindilbeachcasinoresort.com.au/bars/infinity">Infinity</a>, its chic poolside club where DJs play tunes as you take in views from the city’s only beachside infinity pool (note that the resort’s lagoon pool is for hotel guests only). Nearby, <a href="https://nt.gov.au/leisure/parks-reserves/find-a-park/george-brown-darwin-botanic-gardens">George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens</a> are also worth a look.</p>
      <p>If you happen to find yourself in Darwin on a Wednesday night, don’t miss the <a href="https://www.darwinrailwayclub.org/">Darwin Railway Club’s</a> legendary Swing Night, where you can learn to swing dance as a 20-piece big band provides the perfect background music.</p>
      <h3>Australia’s Best National Parks Are Close By</h3>

      <p>Darwin’s proximity to three of the Top End’s best national parks makes it the perfect base for beginning a road trip to any of them.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most popular — and Australia’s largest — is <a href="https://parksaustralia.gov.au/kakadu/">Kakadu National Park</a>, located about a two-hour drive from downtown Darwin. A $17 park pass gives you access for up to 14 days so you can take your time exploring and hiking to your heart’s desire among stunning riverside scenery and marshlands, ancient Aboriginal rock art and dramatic waterfalls reachable only by 4WD vehicle or helicopter. You don’t necessarily have to rough it either, as there are hotel accommodations available inside the park, including the <a href="https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-9616-mercure-kakadu-crocodile-hotel/index.shtml">Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel</a>, which was designed to look like a giant crocodile. Otherwise, there’s a hotel, caravan park, and campground <a href="https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-9638-cooinda-lodge-kakadu/index.shtml?utm_term=mar&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAh5_uBRA5EiwASW3Iatis2ztIrRoBrUcEe9TlbYqYIMgbeBEb_dFECN-h-sI4LAUtp28ZDRoCPHsQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_campaign=ppc-ach-mar-goo-au-en-au-exa-sear-au&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=au-en-all-all&amp;utm_source=google">at Cooinda</a> near the center of the park, which has a lovely pool and restaurant to help you relax after a long day of sightseeing.</p>
      <p>Closer to the town of Katherine and about a three-hour drive from Darwin, <a href="https://nt.gov.au/leisure/parks-reserves/find-a-park/find-a-park-to-visit/nitmiluk-national-park">Nitmiluk National Park</a> is home to Katherine Gorge and Edith Falls, both favorite spots of locals and visitors alike. Take a boat or canoe ride down the Katherine River to get up close to the wildlife (prices vary). The 1.8-km (1.1-mile) Baruwei Lookout Walk near the Visitor Center requires a walk up many steps, but the views of the gorge below make it all worthwhile.</p>
      <p>About a 90-minute drive from Darwin is <a href="https://nt.gov.au/leisure/parks-reserves/find-a-park/find-a-park-to-visit/litchfield-national-park">Litchfield National Park</a>, the perfect escape from the city for a swim at Florence Falls, Wangi Falls, or Buley Rockhole. Check out the park’s magnetic termite mounds and go for a stroll at the overlook point for impressive views of Tolmer Falls.</p>
      <p>Remember that no natural body of water in the Northern Territory is guaranteed to be croc-free at all times so <a href="https://nt.gov.au/emergency/community-safety/crocodile-safety-be-crocwise">pay special attention</a> to any posted signs before you dive in!</p>
      <h3>You’ll Find Hotel Options For Every Budget</h3>

      <p>Whether you’re a backpacker on a budget or want to splurge on your big trip to Australia, Darwin’s got an assortment of accommodations for everyone. Along the Esplanade, you’ll find two DoubleTree hotels next to each other — the <a href="https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/northern-territory/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-esplanade-darwin-DRWEDDI/index.html">DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Esplanade Darwin</a> wins in my book because of the pool — <a href="https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-1748-novotel-darwin-cbd/index.shtml">Novotel Darwin CBD</a> and <a href="https://www.mantrahotels.com/mantra-on-the-esplanade/">Mantra on the Esplanade</a>.</p>
      <p>Toward the city center, you’ll find a Hilton, Rydges, another Mantra property and several smaller hotels attached to lively restaurants and bars. There’s also a <a href="https://www.travelodge.com.au/hotel/resort-darwin/">Travelodge</a> near Frogshollow park, and a variety of <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/findabed.php/ChosenCity.Darwin/ChosenCountry.Australia">hostels with swimming pools</a> to choose from if you’re into the Darwin #hostellife scene and are looking for new travel buddies.</p>
      <p>Those looking to splurge should check out <a href="https://www.mindilbeachcasinoresort.com.au/">Mindil Beach Casino Resort</a>, where you can stay in super-luxe resort rooms that lead out to the lagoon pool or overlook Mindil Beach. Its infinity pool is pictured above.</p>
