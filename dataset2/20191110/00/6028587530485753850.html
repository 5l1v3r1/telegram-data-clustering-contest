      <p><i>Anthem</i>, the seemingly immortal loot shooter, is not done making content yet. Though what BioWare is currently producing for the game appears to be a dramatically scaled back version of their original intentions.A few weeks ago, BioWare Head of Live Services Chad Robertson wrote an article that said that <i>Anthem</i> was abandoning its “Act” structure in favor of making seasonal content instead. Robertson has since left BioWare completely, but the concept of <i>Anthem</i> seasonal content lives on under…I actually have no idea who is running <i>Anthem</i> right now.</p>
      <p>But someone is making stuff. First we had a Halloween-based event with Season of the Skulls that included modified enemies and a reworking of the Catacylsm into something spookier. Now, the PTS is live with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/dthp1t/public_test_server_megathread_discussion_feedback/">new, winter-themed event, Icetide.</a></p>
      <p>So far, there appear to be three main components of the Icetide:</p>
      <p><b>A Snow Map</b>: BioWare is covering the current <i>Anthem</i> map in snow to celebrate the winter season, even the steamier jungles. I’m not sure how this effects enemies or environmental hazards, but it looks pretty.</p>
      <p><b>Time Trials</b>: This is introduction of in effect, Javelin racing, as there will be courses around the map full of what I am deeming “<i>Superman 64</i> rings” that you have to fly through, albeit with a less frustrating flight system than that infamous game had. Could be fun.</p>
      <p><b>Stronghold Challenges</b>: This is effectively introducing scoring to Strongholds, borrowing from the Cataclysm’s score/currency system, where you will have to kill a lot of enemies and beat the Strongholds quickly for max prizes, complete with Inversions modifying play. Reminds me of <i>Destiny</i>’s Nightfalls more or less exactly.</p>
      <p>There may be more, but that’s mainly what I’ve gathered from early info, including this video from Food Then Games, which you may want to check out:</p>
      <p>It seems clear that <i>Anthem</i>’s current plan is less about making new content and more about modifying existing content into something replayable. The Cataclysm was a truly large, worthy addition to the game, but now we don’t know when we’re going to see something like that added to <i>Anthem</i> again, if ever. Most everyone is writing the game off as dead at this point, but BioWare has not abandoned it yet. At least not fully, even if resources do clearly appear to be getting scaled back in time.</p>
      <p>As ever, I remain fascinated by this saga and sure, I’ll play some Icetide to see what’s up when it arrives.</p>
