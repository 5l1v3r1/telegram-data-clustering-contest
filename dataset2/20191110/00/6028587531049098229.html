      <p>Women have had enough.They have found their voices and, as they travel the globe, they are proudly standing up for their rights.</p>
      <p>These gifts will empower them as they make their way and, because women tend to take care of the world, many of them also give back to important causes with each purchase.</p>
      <p>As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie said, “We should all be feminists.” Sure, feminists experience delays and lost luggage and reclining passengers who end up in their lap, too; nevertheless, they persist.</p>
