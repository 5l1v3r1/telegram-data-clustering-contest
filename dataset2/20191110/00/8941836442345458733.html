      <p>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) - The latest on the political crisis in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bolivia/">Bolivia</a> (all times local):</p>
      <p>10:40 p.m.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bolivia/">Bolivia</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Evo Morales</a> claims authorities are seeking to arrest him now that he has given up the presidency under pressure after weeks of social unrest over the country’s disputed election.</p>
      <p>But a police commander said Sunday night no warrant has been issued for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a>, whose whereabouts are unknown.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a> said: “I report to the world and Bolivian people that a police officer publicly announced that he has instructions to execute an unlawful apprehension order against me; in addition, violent groups also stormed my home.”</p>

      <p>Police Gen. Yuri Calderon says rumors of police seeking to arrest <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a> are “fake news.” He says no apprehension order has been issued for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a>.</p>
      <p>Armed intruders, however, did break into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a>‘ home in Cochabamba.</p>

        <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he is standing with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bolivia/">Bolivia</a>’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Evo Morales</a>, who has abruptly resigned as president amid political turmoil that erupted after his disputed election to a fourth term.</p>
        <p>Maduro said Sunday in a nationally broadcast statement via telephone that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a> has fallen victim to the same U.S.-backed plot that seeks to topple him from power and install a right-wing government in Venezuela. The two leftist leaders are long political allies.</p>
        <p>Venezuela’s socialist party leaders are calling on Venezuelans to join in a march next Saturday to show solidarity with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a>.</p>
        <p>In Maduro’s words: “Let’s go to the street to defend the people’s right to democracy, freedom and socialism.”</p>
        <p>Also next Saturday, U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido is urging his supporters to demonstrate against Maduro.</p>

        <p>In a statement, Argentina’s government says calm is needed for Bolivians to navigate the transition to new elections. In its words: “It is imperative that all Bolivian political forces and leaders act at this delicate time with responsibility and restraint.”</p>
        <p>The Argentine statement also says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bolivia/">Bolivia</a> should work with its regional neighbors as well as impartial international groups and observers to ensure a transparent election.</p>

        <p>In a statement Sunday night, the department says: “We urge the OAS to send a mission to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bolivia/">Bolivia</a> to oversee the new electoral process and to ensure that the new Electoral Tribunal is truly independent and reflects a broad swath of Bolivian society. The Bolivian people deserve free and fair elections.”</p>

        <p>Marcelo Ebrard also says on Twitter that Mexico would offer asylum to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a> if should ask for it. There is no indication that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a> has done that.</p>

        <p>The attorney general’s office earlier announced that it was opening an investigation into allegations raised by the OAS report.</p>

        <p>Marcelo Ebrard says that “there is a military operation going on, and we reject it.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Morales</a> announced his resignation Sunday soon after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bolivia/">Bolivia</a>’s military commander called on him to resign amid unrest over allegations of fraud in the country’s Oct. 20 presidential election.</p>
        <p>Going on Twitter, Ebrard said: “Mexico will maintain its position of respect for democracy and institutions. Coup no.”</p>

        <p>Bolivian President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evo-morales/">Evo Morales</a> has announced his resignation, seeking to calm the country after weeks of unrest over a disputed election that he had claimed to win.</p>

        <p>A preliminary report by the Organization of American States found a “heap of observed irregularities” in the presidential contest and said a new vote should be held.</p>
