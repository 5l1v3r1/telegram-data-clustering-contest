      <h2>Miley Cyrus' boyfriend Cody Simpson has said the procedure was a success as the singer begins several weeks of convalescence after surgery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:02:28+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Miley Cyrus has undergone surgery on her vocal cords and will have to remain silent for weeks.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old was hospitalised last month with tonsillitis but was forced to return to hospital this week.</p>
      <p>People magazine reported the Wrecking Ball singer has 'now left the hospital' after undergoing surgery.</p>
      <p>A source told the site: "When Cyrus was hospitalised for tonsillitis last month, she discovered a separate issue with her vocal cords, which she had unknowingly had for years.</p>
      <p>"After learning of the issue, Cyrus was told she would need to have surgery before the end of the year, and that the recovery process would include several weeks of silence."</p>

      <p>The surgery comes after Miley revealed last month that she was on vocal rest after being hospitalised with tonsillitis.</p>
      <p>She posted a video of her working out, performing pilates and captioning it with: "On vocal rest not body."</p>

      <p>Cody also shared a pic of his girlfriend, to which he added: "She made it home [sic] Recovering from surgery send all the vibes."</p>
      <p>Miley and Cody have been together for just over a month, with their romance being revealed when they were spotted kissing in a Los Angeles restaurant.</p>
      <p>The star has had a turbulent few months since splitting from her ex husband Liam Hemsworth after seven months of marriage.</p>
      <p>She then embarked on a two-month fling over the summer with her friend Kaitlynn Carter.</p>
