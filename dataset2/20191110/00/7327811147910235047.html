      <p>MIDTOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- The arrival of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree officially kicked off the holiday season.</p>
      <p>The symbolic 77-foot tall Norway Spruce arrived early Saturday and was lifted into place by a crane.</p>
      <p>The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree came from the village of Florida in Orange County, NY, about an hour north of New York City.</p>
      <p>Visitors were able to witness the engineering feat as the iconic holiday symbol was raised off a 115-foot-long trailer and erected into its prominent home in Rockefeller Center.</p>
      <p>The donor, Carol Schultz, had the privilege of driving the spike into the trunk of the tree with a sledgehammer before the tree was lifted into place.</p>
      <p>Thousands of spectators are expected to come and visit the tree in all its splendor throughout the holiday season but can now get a sneak peek of the tree before it is properly lit.</p>
      <p>The Tree Lighting Ceremony is scheduled for early December.</p>
