      <h1>General election 2019: The town that won't get a choice</h1>

        <b>At every general election, there is one constituency in the UK where the voters don't get to vote for the main parties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"A pointless vote."</p>
      <p>"Undemocratic."</p>
      <p>"A sham."</p>
      <p>Those are the views of some of the 80,000-strong electorate in Buckingham, who feel they haven't had a democratic say at a general election since 2005.</p>
      <p>That's because Buckingham's MP has been John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons for the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>A longstanding parliamentary tradition means major parties agree not to stand against the Speaker, who is considered to be politically neutral.</p>

      <p>The convention is occasionally broken by some parties - such as the Green Party and UKIP - but that didn't hamper the re-election of Mr Bercow.</p>
      <p>He won his seat at the last election in 2017, standing as "the Speaker seeking re-election", with 65% of the vote - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000608">a majority of more than 25,000.</a></p>
      <p>"It looked for a while as though Bercow would never go - that we would never actually get a meaningful vote," jokes Phil Harriss, 57, from the village of Brill, 16 miles from Buckingham.</p>
      <p>He started a campaign called "Give us a voice, not a Speaker" before the 2015 election when his daughter became eligible to vote.</p>
      <p>"I realised she didn't really have a meaningful vote and neither did anyone else in the constituency," he said. "We haven't had since 2005."</p>
      <p>The predominantly rural constituency of Buckingham is nestled between Oxford, Aylesbury and Milton Keynes and covers Chequers - the official country residence of the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Phil, who is not affiliated to a particular party, said there was a lack of awareness about the situation facing Buckingham voters - both within the constituency and outside.</p>
      <p>People would vote for Mr Bercow thinking they were voting Conservative, he said, but they didn't realise that, as Speaker, he no longer represented the party.</p>
      <p>He said the problem didn't stop at elections, but also between elections the Speaker didn't vote in Parliament "so effectively we're not represented".</p>
      <p>"The more I investigated it, it just seems so undemocratic," he said. "There's a lot of things that need modernising in Parliament and this is certainly one of them. It's a sham."</p>

      <p>Lifetime Conservative supporter Trevor Nicosia, 60, from Princes Risborough, described his vote at the last three elections as "useless".</p>
      <p>"Why do I go down to the polling station? I do because that's democracy and my son is 20 and it would be bad for me to not set an example for my kids.</p>
      <p>"But it seems a bit pointless. It makes you wonder why you are getting up off your backside to do so."</p>
      <p>After Mr Bercow's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50242631">retirement as Speaker,</a> Labour MP and deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50293505">elected as his replacement</a> on Monday.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>So now it's the turn of the voters in Sir Lindsay's constituency of Chorley, Lancashire, to find their options restricted.</p>
      <p>The market town of Chorley sits at the heart of the south Lancashire constituency - a mainly rural area lying to the north west of Manchester.</p>
      <p>Laura Crowther, a 39-year-old teacher from Chorley, said she was "really angry" that at such an important time in British politics, her MP has essentially been assured his seat by Parliament.</p>
      <p>She said Sir Lindsay, who has held the seat since 1997, would probably have been re-elected.</p>
      <p>But "to deny me and thousands of others our chance to at least have our say - even if the outcome would probably be the same - just seems a little unfair and, frankly, corrupt".</p>

      <p>Laura has always voted in elections, but said she was unsure what to do this time around, although she was leaning towards spoiling her ballot.</p>
      <p>"Why don't they take his parliamentary seat from him and allow another Labour candidate to stand in Chorley - then at least the people are given their hard-fought right to vote?" she asked.</p>
      <p>Voting in his second general election will be 22-year-old Oliver Knights, who represents the Young Conservatives in Chorley but admitted there was no longer any point in trying to drum up support for the Tories in his hometown.</p>
      <p>"For this election I'll canvass support in other constituencies. There are a lot of marginal seats in Lancashire, so I'm trying to think of the bigger picture."</p>

        <figcaption>Oliver Knights says he'd like to have a choice at the election but he understands the tradition<cite>Oliver Knights</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Oliver said despite having different party allegiances to the new Speaker, he would probably vote for Sir Lindsay rather than spoil his ballot paper.</p>
      <p>Not voting isn't an option, he added, as "it's a right that people died for".</p>
      <p>He said while it was disappointing not to get a choice at the election, the increasing prominence of the role of Speaker, largely down to Mr Bercow, could benefit his town.</p>
      <p>He hopes Sir Lindsay getting the position will help "create a buzz" in the area and engage people in politics.</p>
      <p>"If you take a step back then it gives Chorley uniqueness," he said, "only we have the Speaker".</p>
