      <p>The 50th anniversary of the Internet was recently celebrated by those that trace the origins of the vaunted worldwide web to the first time that a message was transmitted on the ARPANET (a forerunner to the Internet), <a href="https://samueli.ucla.edu/upcoming-events/internet50-celebrating-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-the-internet/">occurring on October 29, 1969 at UCLA</a> and in connection with the Stanford Research Institute (known today as SRI).Philosophically, most of those involved in the development of the Internet hoped that having a global means to electronically communicate might lend itself to greater freedom on this earth.</p>
      <p>When people get to know each other, presumably the chances of treating each other as inanimate objects and discounting their humanity is lessened.</p>
      <p>There was some heartfelt cheering going on when the Internet was later used as a means for accelerating revolutions that overcame dreadful oppression. Famous instances of pro-democracy grassroots efforts using the Internet that ultimately toppled untoward governments are exactly the kind of people-power catalyzing capabilities that were envisioned.</p>
      <p>Technology typically though is a dual-edged sword.</p>
      <p>You can be freed by the sword, and yet you can also be imprisoned by the sword.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is a concern <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rising-threat-of-digital-nationalism-11572620577">that digital nationalism</a> is beginning to take hold.</p>
      <p>Countries can opt to craft an immense electronic firewall that prevents those within that specific country to readily connect with people outside of that country. Special “kill switches” can be established too, allowing the government of a country to quickly disconnect any efforts to go electronically beyond the borders of the country by citizens that are stretching out their necks.</p>
      <p>Besides restricting access, a government might also dictate what kind of content will be allowed onto the country-constrained Internet. Undesirable content can be electronically detected and removed. Electronic filters can attempt to inhibit access. Freedom of expression becomes only the kind and amount of expression that the government declares suitable.</p>
      <p>On top of those disquieting aspects, the government can also use the Internet to trace the activities of its citizens. Personal privacy becomes lacking when the government keeps track of what online sites you’ve visited and with whom you are online communicating.</p>
      <p>Those of us that use the Internet each day in everyday ways are ingrained in the assumption of a fully open and globally far-reaching Internet and are shocked and taken aback at the very idea that a country might turn the tables on the Internet and make it into a foreboding tool of government control and public repression.</p>
      <p>I’d like to briefly switch topics and then tie together seemingly disparate topics that are perhaps surprisingly quite related.</p>
      <p>Efforts are underway by tech firms and automakers to create the next generation of cars. We are on the verge of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/11/03/self-driving-cars-likely-to-spur-solo-occupancy-and-paradoxically-undercut-true-ridesharing/">having true self-driving cars</a>, ones that are driven by AI and there is no human driver involved.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of hoped-for pluses that are expected to come along with true self-driving cars.</p>
      <p>Presumably, driverless cars will be in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/08/13/the-moral-imperative-of-self-driving-cars/">lot less car accidents</a>, reducing immensely the 40,000 deaths and 1.2 million injuries that occur in the United States alone each year. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/05/21/princeton-summit-bolsters-driverless-cars-for-all-including-the-mobility-marginalized/">mobility will be expanded</a> via self-driving cars to include those that are today mobility disadvantaged. All in all, it seems like driverless cars will be a societal godsend.</p>
      <p>Time to tie together two key topics.</p>
      <p>Here’s the question to seriously ponder: <i>Could a nation-state decide to take over true self-driving cars that are within its sovereignty?</i></p>
      <p>Just as digital nationalism involves taking over the Internet by a country, a likewise act could possibly occur involving a country that takes over all the vaunted driverless cars within its borders, a form of self-driving nationalism.</p>
      <p>Yes, it can occur.</p>
      <p>Yikes!</p>
      <p>Let’s unpack the matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is important to clarify what I mean when referring to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/22/musk-unveils-audacious-vision-for-tesla-self-driving-tech-but-level-5-target-looks-unlikely">true self-driving cars</a>.</p>
      <p>True self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</p>
      <p>These driverless cars are considered a <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/">Level 4 and Level 5</a>, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at a <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/">Level 2 or Level 3</a>. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</p>
      <p>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/">possible to achieve</a>, and nor how long it will take to get there.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/08/06/thinking-logically-about-the-risks-of-self-driving-cars/">all life-or-death guinea pigs</a> in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some point out).</p>
      <p>Since the semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, such cars aren’t particularly going to alter the determination of where cars go, since human drivers will remain in the driver’s seat (of course, a government could nonetheless regulate the driver’s as to monitoring them and dictating where they can drive, but this is a gargantuan distributed kind of control that is hard to implement and enforce).</p>
      <p>There is essentially no difference between using a Level 2 or Level 3 versus a conventional car when it comes to the nationalism topic.</p>
      <p>It is notable to point out that in spite of those dolts that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, do not be misled into believing that you can take away your attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</p>
      <p>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the car, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</p>
      <p>
        <b>True Self-Driving Cars And Control</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the use of Level 4 and Level 5 driverless cars, there isn’t a human driver in the car. Occupants inside the self-driving car are all considered passengers.</p>
      <p>The AI system that’s on-board the driverless car is doing the driving.</p>
      <p>Updates to the AI software are undertaken via the use of <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/air-ota-updating-ai-self-driving-cars/">OTA (Over-The-Air)</a> updating, consisting of the car initiating an electronic connection with a cloud-based service and downloading the latest system patches.</p>
      <p>The OTA is also used to upload data that has been collected by the self-driving car.</p>
      <p>Data that can be uploaded include the <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/multi-sensor-data-fusion-msdf-and-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/">sensor collected data</a> that is being captured by the cameras of the self-driving car, along with data coming from the radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, ultrasound, and any other sensors mounted to the vehicle as an aid in the AI performing the driving task.</p>
      <p>In addition, there are likely to be cameras pointing inward into the interior of the driverless car.</p>
      <p>If you own a self-driving car and are allowing it to be used in a ridesharing service, you’ll want to know whether any passengers happen to mark graffiti or tear-up those expensive leather seats. And, if your children are riding in a driverless car to school, you’d feel better about them riding in the no-adults-present self-driving car by being able to watch the kids on your smartphone during their driving journey.</p>
      <p>Not all self-driving cars will be the same.</p>
      <p>This comes as a surprise to many people that seem to think that the tech firms and automakers are all taking the same approach to devising true self-driving cars.</p>
      <p>Instead, each brand or model of a self-driving car will likely have its own proprietary way of performing the driving task.</p>
      <p>That being said, the odds are that most driverless cars will be operating in somewhat the same ways. They all need to abide by the driving laws and driving rules to sufficiently be roadway capable on our public streets.</p>
      <p>Pundits are predicting that self-driving cars will be <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/affordability-of-ai-self-driving-cars/">primarily owned in fleets</a>. A large company such as an automaker or a ridesharing firm or any other entity will buy a flock of driverless cars and put them around town for use on a ridesharing basis.</p>
      <p>Despite the aspect that the self-driving cars might be somewhat distinct by model or brand, and despite the aspect that flocks might be owned by various companies, there is one thing that all driverless cars will likely have in-common.</p>
      <p>The in-common element is that the driving will be performed by an on-board AI system, and furthermore that the on-board AI system can be changed via OTA, along with the data collected by the driverless car being pumped-up to an online cloud someplace.</p>
      <p>So what, you might ask?</p>
      <p>Here’s the rub, and it’s a big one.</p>
      <p>
        <i>A nation-state could decide that any of the self-driving cars within its sovereignty must abide entirely by the wishes of the government.</i>
      </p>
      <p>If any automaker or tech firm didn’t want to comply, the nation-state could kick those cars out of the country.</p>
      <p>The government might take such steps in a slow and gradually ratcheting up manner or might wait until driverless cars are relatively well-established in its domain and then try a midnight takeover if you will.</p>
      <p>What makes the whole takeover aspect feasible is the point that the driver is a piece of automation and the automation can be established and changed remotely.</p>
      <p>A kind of perfect storm for a government that wants to control its people.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Chilling Impacts</b>
      </p>
      <p>In theory, the government could decide whether Jane or Joe can use a self-driving car, perhaps denying them any kind of car-related usage or might dictate where Jane or Joe can be driven to by the driverless cars.</p>
      <p>To keep the public from avoiding the strong arm of the government, a nation-state might ban all human driving, forcing everyone that wants to use a car to use a government-controlled driverless car.</p>
      <p>The government can grab the voluminous data being gathered by the sensors of the driverless cars and aggregate it to get a large-scale indication of where its people go.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that the sensors are like a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/06/11/making-money-on-self-driving-cars-the-roving-eye-will-be-golden/">roving video camera</a>, and when you have millions of cars crisscrossing your city or town, you could stitch together a rather comprehensive understanding of not just where the cars go, but also whatever the cars see wherever they go (such as you standing at a street corner or playing ball in your front yard with your children).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the government might <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/multi-party-privacy-and-ai-autonomous-cars/">insist that the inward-facing camera</a>s be continually videotaping whatever happens inside the driverless cars. This video could be uploaded via the OTA and the government might use it in nefarious ways.</p>
      <p>Imagine that people riding in these government zombie cars would need to be extremely cautious in what they say while sitting inside the self-driving car. Their every utterance could be readily examined and used against them by the government.</p>
      <p>This is a form of digital nationalism that goes beyond the online world and reaches directly into the physical and everyday world.</p>
      <p>If this doesn’t already send chills up your back, I’ll add another equally scary thought.</p>
      <p>You are riding in a self-driving car and have told the AI that you are heading to the grocery store. The AI replies that yes, it will drive you to the grocery store.</p>
      <p>Along the way, you are looking at your smartphone and reading some emails and playing a fun online game.</p>
      <p>The AI seemingly reaches your destination and suddenly two-armed government officials open the door of the driverless car.</p>
      <p>Turns out that the government has decided that you are a wanted person.</p>
      <p>You were easy to find because the moment that you got into the driverless car the facial recognition knew who you were. The AI communicated with the cloud, and the government then notified some goons to meet you at your destination.</p>
      <p>Of course, the AI could have been directed to simply take you <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/features/robojacking-self-driving-cars-prevention-better-ai/">straight to a government detention center</a>, rather than taking you to the destination that you thought you were going to.</p>
      <p>Scary upon scary, it would seem.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is easy to write-off this kind of self-driving nationalism or governmental take over as utterly fanciful and could never happen.</p>
      <p>Maybe even place the idea into one of those crackpot <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/conspiracy-theories-about-ai-self-driving-cars/">conspiracy theory buckets about AI</a>.</p>
      <p>I’d say that you ought to rethink that assumption.</p>
      <p>First, let’s be clear that I’m not saying the <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/singularity-and-ai-self-driving-cars/">AI becomes sentient</a> and opts to take over. Instead, the AI is merely a form of automation that is dependent upon humans that run the overall aspects.</p>
      <p>The humans in-charge of the AI software for the self-driving cars and that are responsible for the OTA are, well, they are humans, and subject to the whims of their government.</p>
      <p>In that manner, this takeover theory is about a socio-political matter, more so than a technical-only matter.</p>
      <p>The technology makes the Pandora's box possible, and it is the human element that can open the box.</p>
      <p>Second, it is important to emphasize that this would most likely occur within a nation-state.</p>
      <p>This would not necessarily be widespread among many nations and instead be limited to those governments that have an oppressive will and are able to control the freedom of their people.</p>
      <p>As such, you might end-up with most nations having driverless cars that roam freely and are not being government-controlled. Meanwhile, a smaller set of nation-states that are bound to see the controlling opportunities in nationalizing their driverless cars will choose to do so.</p>
      <p>Third, you might be tempted to claim that no rightful thinking automaker or tech firm would ever allow this to occur.</p>
      <p>That’s a debatable contention.</p>
      <p>Sure, presumably many or most of the automakers or tech firms might insist that such a take over won’t be allowed. If their driverless cars are already in the nation-state that wants to do the takeover, the automaker or tech firm <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/freezing-robot-problem-and-ai-self-driving-cars/">might “brick” the self-driving cars</a> and null out the on-board AI and turn-off the OTA.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if there are firms that were working closely with the government all along, those firms might either find themselves in a slippery slope fashion allowing a takeover to occur or might be woven into the government such that there really is no independence about how the driverless cars are to be utilized.</p>
      <p>Fourth, you might believe that humans could fight back.</p>
      <p>Of course, if the people within the nation-state decide to revolt against the government takeover, the people would likely be able to re-institute “freedom” among the self-driving cars in that nation.</p>
      <p>Would rebels that are hackers be able to usurp the government control of driverless cars?</p>
      <p>There’s an irony involved in asking such a question.</p>
      <p>Right now, most are worried that bad hat hackers will be able to break into self-driving cars and get the AI to do their bidding. To prevent this, automakers and tech firms are supposed to be building all sorts of <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/catastrophic-cyber-hacking-self-driving-cars/">cyber protections and security mechanisms</a> to prevent such intrusions.</p>
      <p>The irony, of course, is that we are herein asking whether “good attackers” that want to turn the enslaved driverless cars into freedom driverless cars could hack their way into doing so.</p>
      <p>The answer should be no, since if the nefarious hackers cannot get into the rightful self-driving cars, the same barriers should be preventing the freedom fighter hackers from getting into the oppressive self-driving cars.</p>
      <p>Some might merely wave their hands and say this is all a tempest in a teapot.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is provide an override for humans to take over a driverless car, they might chortle. In that manner, if a human doesn’t like the government controlling the self-driving car, the human merely hits a button and voila, the human is now driving the car.</p>
      <p>Sorry, that’s a rabbit hole.</p>
      <p>I won’t go into all of the details, but the moment that you allow humans to drive a driverless car, it no longer is a true self-driving car, and you are back to square one about the notion of autonomous cars. Plus, there are unlikely to be accessible driving controls for humans to use on a true autonomous car.</p>
      <p>Okay, you say, but at least allow the human to command the AI rather than the government. Oops, that’s not going to work either because the human in the vehicle might be untoward or have untoward intentions.</p>
      <p>On and on it goes.</p>
      <p>You might make a stretch offer that maybe the AI ought to indeed become sentient, in which case it could presumably just say no to the government oppressors. That’s a bit of sardonic commentary since there are many AI conspiracists that insist that once AI becomes sentient <a href="https://www.aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/super-intelligent-ai-paperclip-maximizer-conundrum-and-ai-self-driving-cars/">it will imprison or kill us al</a>l.</p>
      <p>One additional argument is that maybe a totally government run and controlled nationalistic self-driving industry is a good thing. Perhaps it would induce a country to ensure that all have equal access to autonomous cars and there would be greater efficiencies than if left to a marketplace disparate approach.</p>
      <p>I have my doubts that such a concentration would end-up swaying to the goodness of mankind and that the abject power it would create might be overly tempting toward undermining the overall freedoms of the people.</p>
      <p>Hope that doesn’t seem excessively pessimistic as a socio-political outcome.</p>
      <p>Anyway, let’s not all panic just yet.</p>
      <p>This discussion about the potential of a nation-state takeover is intended as a wake-up call, serving to spark insightful and reasoned debate about how the self-driving tech that is perceived by most to be neutral is, as always, something that can be turned toward the good of mankind or toward the bad of mankind.</p>
      <p>Nation-states that are eager to find additional means to control their people are ready to pounce on the advent of driverless cars.</p>
      <p>Nation-states that are excited about the opportunity to extend mobility and reduce car crashes are ready to adopt and accept driverless cars.</p>
      <p>It’s up to the people to help shape which way the self-driving cars go, including whether driverless cars are a freedom boon or a form of freedom bondage.</p>
      <p>You decide.</p>
