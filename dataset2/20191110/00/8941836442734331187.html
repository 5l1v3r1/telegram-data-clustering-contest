      <h1>LSU-Alabama scores most-watched game of season for CBS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>The LSU-Alabama game drew 16.636 million viewers for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cbs/">CBS</a>, making it the most-watched college football game of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cbs/">CBS</a> said LSU’s 46-41 victory against Alabama, a matchup of the AP Top 25’s No. 1 and No. 2 teams, scored a 9.7 rating, the highest for any regular-season college football game on any network in eight years.</p>
      <p>The Tigers and Crimson Tide kicked off in the afternoon for the first time since 2010 because <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cbs/">CBS</a> had used its one night game on Notre Dame-Georgia in September. That was the previous most-watched game of the season at 9.349 million viewers.</p>
      <p>Overall, the “SEC on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cbs/">CBS</a>” is having its best year through 11 weeks since 1990, averaging 7.091 viewers. That’s up 39% from last year’s 5.088 million.</p>
