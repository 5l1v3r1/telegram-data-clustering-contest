      <p>On Friday’s broadcast of Fox News Radio’s “Brian Kilmeade Show,” Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) stated that he expects former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to be the Republican nominee in the Alabama Senate race and stated that he’ll try to help Sessions however he can.</p>
      <p>Cornyn said, “Jeff Sessions is my friend, and I think he has conducted himself honorably through a very, very difficult period of time. And I think he’s got every right to run. And I expect him to be the nominee and to win. So, I’ll be trying to help every way I can.”</p>
