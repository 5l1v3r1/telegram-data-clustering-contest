      <h1>Watch Out Korean Air? Asiana Airlines Poised To Receive New Cashed Up Investor</h1>

      <p>Could Asiana Airlines have a renaissance like All Nippon Airways? For decades ANA was Japan’s challenger but made inroads, eventually becoming the largest airline domestically and then biggest internationally, a position cemented with changed public and government opinion from Japan Airlines’ bankruptcy. Across the Sea of Japan, Asiana has firmly been South Korea’s number two airline but is now at an inflexion point, poised to receive a new cashed up shareholder while public and government support is turning against Korean Air after various scandals.A joint bid from Hyundai Development and Mirae Asset Daewoo is likely to be selected as Asiana’s new controlling shareholder, according to local media reports. The consortium is expected to buy Kumho’s 31% stake for KRW400 billion (US$345 million) and then invest approximately KRW2.1 trillion ($1.8 billion) in Asiana to fund rejuvenation and expansion.</p>
      <p>Lack of cash has seen Asiana operate an older fleet, be slow to install latest seats and even curtail amenity kit distribution.</p>
      <p>Asiana has largely sat out this century’s Asian growth due to poor finances at parent owner Kumho Asiana. In typical chaebol structuring, Asiana was the shareholder of non-aviation companies that later under-performed and dragged Asiana down. This was not unique to Kumho: Korean Air was the largest investor in bankrupt sea logistics company Hanjin Shipping.</p>
      <p>Asiana was in a spiral of high debt that increased borrowing costs, generating more debt. Asiana’s debt ratio is nearly 900%. Besides the direct investment, Asiana will benefit from Hyundai and Mirae’s stronger accounts to reduce borrowing costs and guarantee debt. Hyundai’s debt ratio in June was under 120%.</p>
      <p>Not only would Asiana be on firmer footing, it could overtake Korean Air, part of the Hanjin chaebol that is stronger than Kumho but far smaller than Hyundai. “A large-scale rights offering, if executed, will make Asiana Airlines’ financial conditions stronger than Korean Air,” an unnamed source told the Korea Economic Daily.</p>

      <p>The Hyundai-Mirae consortium is said to have outbid by upwards of KRW1 trillion ($863 million) a consortium led by Aekyung Group, which is the largest investor in Jeju Air, Korea’s largest low-cost carrier and third-largest airline overall. A successful Aekyung bid could have raised anti-competitive questions since Asiana is being sold with its LCC units Air Seoul and Air Busan.</p>
      <p>Aekyung did not address anti-competitive concerns, arguing instead its investment in Jeju Air made it Asiana’s only bidder with aviation experience. Aekyung told local press: “There has been no single case in the history of the global aviation industry in which a company that doesn’t have any experience in airline business acquires an air carrier.” Yet many carriers launched with non-aviation shareholders, such as Aekyung, which started as a soap and detergent company.</p>
      <p>Observers cautioned it would be a leap for Aekyung to transition from owning a relatively small and regional LCC to running a large and global full-service airline. Corporate culture was a concern: Asiana staff may have resented having a LCC owner. Jeju Air’s performance weakened in early 2019, suggesting underlying problems since exacerbated by the Korea-Japan travel downturn.</p>
      <p>Politics could partially see Hyundai’s larger bid outweigh any consideration of Aekyung having a smaller bid but sectoral experience. Hyundai could provide the long-term financial cushion to see Asiana through. Whereas most Korean businesses and politicians come from a Seoul-Busan axis, Kumho Asiana is the most prominent company to originate from Korea’s south. Kumho Asiana needs to be a champion for the region, not a failure.</p>
      <p>There have been few details about a third bid led by activist investor group KCGI, but it was seen to lack a strong financial partner as well as a strategic investor. Korean law prohibits airlines from being owned purely by financial investors.</p>
      <p>In the Hyundai-Mirae bid, Mirae is the financial investor while Hyundai is considered the strategic investor. Hyundai does not have aviation experience but has tried to argue there will be synergies between Asiana and Hyundai’s hotel and duty free business. Mirae also owns hotels. Such synergies may exist but be relatively insignificant, likewise for the suggestion Hyundai’s workforce switches travel preference to Asiana. An alternative read is that Hyundai is diversifying, Asiana has positive long-term prospects for a strong investor, and an airline’s naturally high cash flow will boost the owner.</p>
      <p>Kumho Industrial’s 31% stake has to be sold as part of Kumho’s agreement earlier this year with Korea Development Bank to extend a financial lifeline to Asiana. State-owned KDB was exhausted by Kumho’s repeated financial difficulties and mismanagement under Kumho chairman Park Sam-koo. From the Asiana sale, Kumho makes a decent earning to repay other group debt, but Park will no longer be affiliated with the airline he dearly loves.</p>
      <p>Park’s passion for Asiana is said to have resulted in control, inefficient management and ultimately holding Asiana back – similar but more extreme and antiquated than the management style of late Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho. In a sudden change for Korean aviation, Cho passed away in April, less than two weeks after Park resigned as Asiana chairman.</p>
      <p>Observers expect a successful Hyundai bid will need at least two years to fully immerse itself in Asiana and aviation before mounting a large-scale restructuring and expansion. With Korea’s next general election not until 2022, Hyundai has time to curry government favour.</p>
      <p>Korean Air has a wide advantage over Asiana but would be wise to accelerate the modernisation started under Cho Won-tae, the son of late chairman Cho. Amongst various head starts, Korean Air is learning from joint-venture partner Delta Air Lines about general business improvement.</p>
      <p>Asiana could call on its Star Alliance partners that have been waiting for their Korean peer to show initiative. One Star Alliance member has a relatable rag-to-riches story: ANA.</p>
