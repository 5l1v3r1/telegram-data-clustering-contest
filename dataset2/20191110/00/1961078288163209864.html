      <h1>Woody Allen and Amazon Settle Breach of Contract Lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:49:55+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:49</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Vigdor</a></address>
      <p>Woody Allen and Amazon settled a breach of contract lawsuit that the director had filed after the company backed out of a four-picture movie deal because #MeToo allegations from the 1990s had resurfaced against him.</p>
      <p>The terms of the settlement were not disclosed in a one-page filing on Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The filing said the lawsuit had been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Mr. Allen and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mr. Allen, 83, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/movies/woody-allen-amazon-lawsuit.html?module=inline">sued Amazon in February</a>, accusing the company of reneging on a lucrative commitment for him to make four films.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood division of Amazon, the Seattle-based conglomerate founded by Jeffrey P. Bezos, severed its ties with Mr. Allen in June 2018. The company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/business/media/woody-allen-amazon-lawsuit.html?module=inline">cited a renewed focus on sexual assault allegations against Mr. Allen</a>, primarily those that he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/movies/woody-allen-mia-farrow-dylan-farrow-a-timeline.html?module=inline">molested his daughter</a> Dylan Farrow in 1992, when she was 7.</p>
      <p>Mr. Allen has denied the allegations and has not been charged with any crime. The misconduct allegations against Mr. Allen arose during a bitter child custody battle between Mr. Allen and his former partner, Mia Farrow.</p>
      <p>Mr. Allen’s affair with Soon-Yi Previn, who had been adopted by Ms. Farrow and who later married Mr. Allen, further fueled the dispute, which split the family.</p>
      <p>The feud between Mr. Allen, a three-time Academy Award winner, and Amazon is another product of the #MeToo era in the movie industry, politics, media and business. Among those who have fallen from grace: Harvey Weinstein, Bill O’Reilly and Matt Lauer.</p>
      <p>A key figure in exposing the sexual misconduct cases has been the journalist Ronan Farrow, a son of Mia Farrow and Mr. Allen who has sided with his mother and sister Dylan.</p>
      <p>Mr. Allen’s lawsuit said that Amazon was well aware of the allegations against him when it entered into four separate deals with the director.</p>
