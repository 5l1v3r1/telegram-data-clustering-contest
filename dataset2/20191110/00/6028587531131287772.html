      <h1>Can This Week’s ‘Full Beaver Moon’ Trump A Rare ‘Transit Of Mercury?’</h1>

      <p>Monday, November 11 is a day of astronomical proportions. Veterans Day in the US and <a href="https://www.wincalendar.com/uk/Armistice-Day">Armistice Day</a> and <a href="https://www.wincalendar.com/uk/Remembrance-Day">Remembrance Day</a> in the UK, Australia and Canada, it’s a day that this year hosts some astronomical treats. For the US, it starts with a rare Transit of Mercury across the sun, something that will be witnessed in Europe either side of lunchtime. </p>
      <p>However, there’s something else going on Monday that’s worth your attention, and that’s a beautiful moonrise. Given clear skies above the eastern horizon, dusk will see a bright full moon—called variously the Beaver Moon, Frosty Moon or Long Nights Moon—grace the early evening skies. </p>

      <p>Technically speaking, November 2019’s moon is full on Tuesday, November 12. However, it’s on Monday that the moonrise occurs closest to sunset. From the moment it nudges above the eastern horizon draped in pale orange light, you’ll be in for a celestial sight to match or even surpass the day’s Transit of Mercury. It’s that first 15 minutes that’s the most precious, after which the full moon has risen high enough in the sky to turn yellow, then bright white. After that’s it’s tricky to look at for more than the briefest moments. Its glare is just too much.</p>
      <p>However, if you miss moonrise on Monday (here’s how to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/">find the exact times for your location</a>), try moonset early on Tuesday morning, which should be an even better spectacle given clear skies. Now virtually full, the sight of a full moon apparently peeling off its layers of brightness and once again retreating into muted orange hues, before sinking under the western horizon, is a mesmerising sight. </p>

      <p>To watch the the sun set and moon rise within a fifteen minute time span the night before the full moon, just get outside and find yourself an observation point a few floors up, or on a hill or mountain. If you want an extra-special sight, bring along any pair of binoculars.</p>
