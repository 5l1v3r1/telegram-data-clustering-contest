      <h1>Man arrested after 'Baby Trump' protest balloon stabbed, deflated at Alabama-LSU game</h1>

      <p>A suspect was taken into custody Saturday after he allegedly stabbed a "Baby Trump" protest balloon on display near the University of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/alabama">Alabama</a>, where President Trump was attending the Crimson Tide's football game against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers">LSU</a>.</p>
      <p>Hoyt Hutchinson, 32, was charged with felony first-degree criminal mischief, according to the <a href="https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20191109/suspect-accused-of-stabbing-baby-trump-balloon">Tuscaloosa News</a>. The paper reported that Hutchinson posted a Facebook Live video saying he planned to deflate the balloon depicting Trump as a crying baby wearing a diaper and holding a cell phone.</p>

      <p>“I’m going down here to make a scene, so y’all watch the news,” he said in the video. “This is pathetic. I’m fixing to get rowdy.”</p>
      <p>Later, Hutchinson launched a crowdsourcing page to raise money for legal fees and restitution, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/tuscaloosa/2019/11/trump-balloon-protest-over-after-man-stabs-balloon-arrest-made.html">AL.com reported</a>.</p>
      <p>"Hoyt made sure our beloved president didn't have to see this disrespectful balloon on the streets of Ttown today!!," a message on the page read. As of early Sunday, it showed more than $13,000 had been pledged, surpassing a goal of $6,000.</p>
      <blockquote>"Hoyt made sure our beloved president didn't have to see this disrespectful balloon on the streets of Ttown today!!"<cite>— Fundraising page for Hoyt Hutchinson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>"Good on you," wrote a donor who pledged $20. "I am sick of these nasty social maggots getting away with offensive behavior. That balloon offends me!"</p>
      <p>"Antifa can all but KILL a conservative reporter - a HUMAN BEING - nothing is done. No arrest," another donor wrote. "This young man deflates an OFFENSIVE BALLOON &amp; is arrested. I think we are a little lopsided with justice."</p>
      <p>Jim Girvan, organizer of a group that "adopts" out Baby Trump balloons for protests, told the Associated Press a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut an 8-foot-long gash in the back.</p>

      <p>Baby Trump first rose over London when local activists brainstormed a way to troll Trump. Now several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas around the U.S.</p>
      <p>Donors contributed $7,882 to bring the inflatable roughly a mile from Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium for the Alabama-LSU game. The rental cost $4,500 and any donations above that went to the Equal Justice Initiative. The balloon was surrounded by about a dozen anti-Trump protesters.</p>
      <p>“I’m shaking, I’m so mad right now,” Hutchinson said. "I’m fixing to pop this balloon, without a doubt. Stay tuned, this should be interesting.”</p>
      <p>Hutchinson’s bond was set at $2,500.</p>

      <p>Robert Kennedy, a volunteer "baby sitter" said the balloon immediately began to sag after it was cut.</p>
      <p>The day had been going mostly smoothly, Kennedy said. Some people yelled "Trump 2020" as they passed while others posed for selfies with the balloon. But then Kennedy said a man sidled up on the back of the balloon and attacked it with a knife. He ran away but was caught by police officers.</p>
