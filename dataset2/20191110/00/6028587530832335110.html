      <p>It was the first public appearance as a foursome and a very anticipated one for the <a href="https://orbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/10/19/in-photos-prince-william-and-kate-middletons-trip-to-pakistan-the-best-display-of-soft-power/#5879076430d5">Duke and Duchess of Cambridge</a> and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/10/21/why-are-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-having-such-a-hard-time-with-their-royal-life/#7165292c6229">Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> since Prince Harry admitted publicly that there was a rift with his brother.They reunited for the <a href="https://www.royal.uk/remembrance-2019">British Remembrance celebration</a> and although the four gathered along with other members of the royal family around <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/11/05/dressing-the-queen-royal-behind-the-scene-secrets-revealed-by-her-majestys-dresser/#3109d02f4325">the queen</a> to commemorate the nation's dead during World War I, the two couples never got together and there were no opportunities for photos of the “Fab Four” as the British press called them in days gone by.</p>

      <p>There are a few events on the royal calendar which require Kate, William, <a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">#kensingtonpalace</a>, Harry and Meghan to be in attendance, this one among them. The two couples participated Saturday in the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, followed by the Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall on Sunday, arriving separately within moments of each other, according to precedence as is customary. But they didn't break tradition to talk to each other.</p>
      <p>The British press also noted that they didn’t sit together and palace officials promptly explained there is nothing unusual about the couples being sat far apart and pointed out that they also sat separated at last year's event. </p>

      <p>At the Royal Albert Hall in West London, Harry and Meghan, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?hl=en">@Sussexroyal</a>, were seated in the second row behind Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his girlfriend, while William and Kate, @<a href="https://www.instagram.com/kensingtonroyal/?hl=en">Kensingtonroyal</a>, were seated beside the queen. The service was also attended by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, the Duke of York, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and hundreds of servicemen and veterans. </p>
      <p>Remembrance Day, which falls on November 11, marks the day of the armistice ending the First World War between the Allies and Germany that was signed at Compiègne, France, on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. A two-minute silence is held at 11 a.m. to remember those who died in battle and is observed throughout the Commonwealth,</p>

      <p>The last time the brothers and their wives were seen side by side was at an apparently impromptu family playdate in July, when William and Harry played at a charity polo match in Berkshire and Meghan and Kate brought their children, George, Charlotte, Louis and Archie to watch.</p>
      <p>Their reunion for Remembrance celebrations was also the first since Harry and Meghan’s television documentary during which they revealed their struggles with public life and Harry admitted that he and his brother had drifted apart and were “on different”paths,” confirming months of speculation in the British press about a rift between them.</p>

      <p>Interviewed during <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/10/08/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-vs-british-tabloids-is-it-really-an-open-war/#992c5527636d">their October royal trip to South Africa</a> by broadcaster Tom Bradby for the documentary “<i>Harry &amp; Meghan: An African Journey,</i>” the couple appeared deeply emotional as they confessed that their “idyllic life” as members of the royal family is becoming a struggle, complaining of what they called unfair scrutiny and untruthful stories published by the tabloid media.</p>
      <p>Harry also spoke about his difficulties to deal with the “incredibly raw” death of his mother, Princess Diana, and admitted that his anxieties require “constant management.” </p>
      <p>Meghan, on the other hand, spoke of the pressure of life in the spotlight, saying she had “no idea” of the strain she would deal with as a member of the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Prince William admitted that he was “worried” about Harry and hoped that he and Meghan were alright, which sparked even more rumors about the brothers’ separation.</p>
      <p>In March, the two popular couples officially separated their joint “court” at Kensington Palace and created their own offices to deal with their work and the causes they patronize. Since then, Meghan and Harry have moved from London to their own Frogmore Cottage in Windsor Castle  – about 25 miles away – and launched their own <a href="https://sussexofficial.uk/">Instagram page</a>.</p>
      <p>For the Remembrance commemoration Meghan and Kate opted for similar looks wearing black dresses adorned with a red poppy pin that has been used since 1921 to pay homage to military members who have died in battle.</p>
      <p>William and Harry both wore dark suits with red-and-dark striped ties.</p>
