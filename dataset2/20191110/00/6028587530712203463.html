      <p>Organizations of all sizes and across all industries are under siege from cyber threats around the clock. Cybersecurity is a concern for every business, however, not all targets have equal value necessarily. Companies that form the backbone of our critical infrastructure are prime targets for attackers seeking to maximize disruption or potential damage, which is why it’s crucial to take every precaution possible to defend them. Last week, a new platform was introduced to help electric energy companies improve protection while reducing the costs of defending the power grid from cyber threats.</p>
      <h3>Asset to Vendor (A2V) Network</h3>
      <p>The roughly 3,000 companies that provide electricity to the United States share many of the same supply chain vendors when it comes to equipment, software, and services. That can be an Achilles heel because it means that malicious actors intent on targeting the power grid can leverage common exploits across many companies, but it is also an advantage because it means that those companies can share information to accelerate efforts to identify and resolve exposed weaknesses. The Asset to Vendor (A2V) Network for Power Utilities—a joint venture between <a href="https://www.fortressinfosec.com/a2v">Fortress Information Security</a> and American Electric Power (AEP)—was designed to promote collaboration among electric companies.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://fortressinfosec.com/fortress-aep-asset-to-vendor-a2v/">press release</a> announcing the launch of the A2V Network, Stephen Swick, Director of Cybersecurity Intelligence and Defense for AEP, said, “Power utilities need to work together to accomplish our shared goal of a secure power grid. A2V offers the opportunity for companies to collaborate and help mitigate the significant costs of protecting the grid.” </p>
      <h3>Supply Chain Risk Management</h3>
      <p>While pursing efforts to improve cybersecurity makes sense on its own merits, for organizations governed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), it is also a regulatory mandate. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) developed guidelines around supply chain risk management standards at the direction of FERC.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nerc.com/FilingsOrders/us/FERCOrdersRules/Order%20No.%20850%20Supply%20Chain%20Risk%20Management%20Reliability%20Standards.pdf">directive explains</a> that the shared supply chain offers a variety of benefits, such as lower costs and better interoperability, but that also creates opportunities for adversaries to develop exploits that can disrupt operations and put end users at risk. “Supply chain risks include insertion of counterfeits or malicious software, unauthorized production, tampering, or theft, as well as poor manufacturing and development practices.”</p>
      <p>The resulting rules require that utilities develop a plan for managing the cyber risk related to their supply chain. The plan must include procedures for prioritizing supply chain vendors based on risk and requirements for standardized risk assessments on each vendor, and a means to verify the authenticity of software manufacturers and the integrity of software updates. The deadline for implementing the plan is June of 2020, and organizations that fail to meet the deadline face potential penalties that could range as high as $1 million per day.</p>
      <h3>Addressing the Supply Chain Challenge</h3>
      <p>The sheer volume of supply chain vendors that provide equipment, software, and services to power utilities makes this a daunting task. The vast majority of the 3,000 electricity providers are small, regional operations that don’t have the manpower or budget to address this requirement effectively.</p>
      <p>The reason Fortress and AEP developed the A2V Network is to provide a platform for sharing technology and information to support security efforts for these organizations. The A2V Network includes a substantial library of completed vendor risk assessments that comply with FERC regulations.</p>
      <p>The press release explains, “Power companies who join A2V will be able to purchase vendor assessments for much less than it would cost for them to conduct the assessment themselves. Participating utilities also will be able to contribute their own completed assessments for purchase by the network and receive a portion of the proceeds. This will help them recover some of their investments in vendor assessments and help reduce overall operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs associated with cyber security compliance.”</p>
      <p>The A2V Network is an example of the kind of sharing and collaboration that needs to happen on a broader and more regular basis to improve cybersecurity for all industries and businesses. Siloed efforts exist and the trend is growing, but everyone will be better off when we are able to break down the walls and openly share relevant information to improve cybersecurity for everyone, rather than every organization trying to fight a futile battle against cyber attacks on its own.</p>
