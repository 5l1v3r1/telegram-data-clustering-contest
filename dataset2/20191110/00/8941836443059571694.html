      <p>SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Jaylen Brown scored 30 points and the Boston Celtics routed the San Antonio Spurs 135-115 on Saturday in a victory that was tempered by the loss of Gordon Hayward, who broke his left hand late in the first half.</p>
      <p>Kemba Walker add 26 points as Boston (7-1) won its seventh straight game and set season highs for total points, first quarter scoring (39 points) and first half scoring (72 points).</p>
      <p>There was a somberness to the victory, though, as Hayward suffered his second significant injury since signing with the Celtics three seasons ago.</p>
      <p>The Boston forward broke his left hand after colliding with San Antonio’s LaMarcus Aldridge with just over a minute remaining in the first half. Hayward was sent for an X-ray that confirmed the diagnosis. He did not return to the game. The Celtics said Hayward will miss at least a month and he could undergo surgery, according to coach Brad Stevens.</p>
      <p>DeMar DeRozan had 22 points for the Spurs (5-4), who trailed by as many as 22 points.</p>

      <p>Boston has not lost since dropping its season opener to Philadelphia, 107-93, on Oct. 23. The Celtics have outscored their opponents 115-101 since that opening loss and raised that dominance against the Spurs.</p>
      <p>PELICANS 115, HORNETS 110</p>
      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Brandon Ingram had 25 points and nine rebounds, and New Orleans overcame 26 turnovers to beat Charlotte and snap a three-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>JJ Redick had 22 points on five 3-pointers and Jrue Holiday added 12 points and 11 assists for the Pelicans (2-7).</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Ingram, who was born and raised in Kinston, North Carolina, finished 8 of 12 from the field and had 10 points in the fourth quarter while the Hornets went cold down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Devonte Graham led the Hornets with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Terry Rozier had 18 points. However, both players shot 5 of 14 from the field as the Hornets were limited to 41% shooting as a team.</p>
        <p>ROCKETS 117, BULLS 94</p>
        <p>CHICAGO (AP) - James Harden narrowly missed his first triple-double of the season, finishing with 42 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists as Houston pulled away in the second half and beat Chicago.</p>
        <p>Russell Westbrook scored 26 points as the Rockets won their third straight.</p>
        <p>Wendell Carter Jr. had 13 points and 16 rebounds for Chicago, which has dropped six of eight.</p>
        <p>The Bulls were a woeful 4-for-32 shooting from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>MAVERICKS 138, GRIZZLIES 122</p>
        <p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Luka Doncic fell just short of a triple-double with 24 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists to lead Dallas over Memphis.</p>
        <p>Doncic recorded his stats in three quarters as Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle sat the second-year guard while Dallas maintained a double-digit lead in the final period. Kristaps Porzingis already had taken the night off recovering from a left knee injury.</p>
        <p>Tim Hardaway Jr. added 20 points for Dallas, Justin Jackson had 17 points and Seth Curry scored 16, all in the first half.</p>
        <p>Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 23 points on 10-for-17 shooting from the field, including a pair of 3-pointers. Jae Crowder added 18 points for the Grizzlies, which lost their second straight.</p>
        <p>THUNDER 114, WARRIORS 108</p>
        <p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Danilo Gallinari scored 19 points, Dennis Schroder added 18, and Oklahoma City beat short-handed Golden State.</p>
        <p>Chris Paul had 16 points and nine assists, Steven Adams scored 13 and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 12 to help the Thunder beat the Warriors for the second time this season. Oklahoma State has won three of its last four games.</p>
        <p>D’Angelo Russell scored 17 of his 30 points in the third quarter to lead Golden State, including a 3-pointer at the buzzer to tie the score at 84-all heading to the fourth. One night earlier, Russell had 52 against Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Alec Burk had 23 points for the Warriors, and Glenn Robinson III finished with 18.</p>
