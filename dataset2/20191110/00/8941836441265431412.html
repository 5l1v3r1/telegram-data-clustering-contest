        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ve starting thinking of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-napolitano/">Andrew Napolitano</a> as prosecutor, jury and hangman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-napolitano/">Napolitano</a>. He’s no longer the fair-minded judge of the president that he was at the beginning of Donald Trump’s term in office. (I would never have accused him of being a supporter, but he seemed fair at one time.)</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-napolitano/">Mr. Napolitano</a> likes to toss names around, as he did in his latest column “Would Roosevelt have made a Trumpian demand with a world leader?” (Web, Nov. 6). In the column he throws up Peggy Noonan, “whose friendship I have enjoyed for many years ” The central point he seems to want to make was on the question of “how history would view President Franklin Delano Roosevelt if, when asked by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for help fighting the Nazis in 1940, he had conditioned that aid on the provision of dirt on Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt’s eventual Republican opponent in the 1940 presidential election.”</p>
      <p>Is <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-napolitano/">Mr. Napolitano</a> suggesting the British government led by Churchill was a corrupt kleptocracy akin to today’s Ukraine?</p>
      <p>Here is a more important question: Would President Trump ever intern American citizens, a la FDR?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-napolitano/">Mr. Napolitano</a>, there was a time when your columns were worth reading for the ideas you brought forth. No more.</p>
