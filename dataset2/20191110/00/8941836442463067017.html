      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Freshman D.J. Carton and Kaleb Wesson each had 13 points and No. 18 Ohio State routed UMass-Lowell 76-56 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes (2-0) got contributions throughout the lineup in the tuneup against the Atlantic East squad ahead of Wednesday night’s matchup with No. 10 Villanova.</p>
      <p>Wesson also had 13 rebounds and five assists. Luther Muhammad added 11 points, while Alonzo Gaffney and Kyle Young each added 10.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes played without senior forward Andre Wesson, who suffered an eye injury in the team’s win over Cincinnati on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>His brother, Kaleb Wesson, already had a double-double by halftime. He had tallied 11 points, 11 rebounds and four assists as the Buckeyes built a 38-25 halftime lead.</p>

      <p>Obadiah Noel led UMass-Lowell (1-2) with 15 points, and Connor Withers had 10.</p>
      <p>It was a tough game for UMass-Lowell guard Christian Lutete, who was coming off a 51-point outburst in the River Hawks’ victory over LIU-Brooklyn on Friday. He had nine points on 4-for-12 shooting.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes shrugged off a slow start and eventually grabbed the lead for good with 13 minutes left in the half. Kaleb Wesson had a one-handed jam off an E.J. Liddell lob before Wesson returned the favor by dishing to Liddell after tracking down an errant pass. Wesson’s crosscourt assist to Carton for a 3 gave OSU its 13-point halftime lead. Ohio State went on a 21-9 run to open the second half.</p>

        <p>UMass-Lowell: The River Hawks have a veteran squad and could be a team to watch in the America East this season. But they couldn’t stay with the more-talented Buckeyes.</p>
        <p>Ohio State: Buckeyes get plenty of contributions against an overmatched team. A better gauge of where they are early will come midweek against national power Villanova.</p>
