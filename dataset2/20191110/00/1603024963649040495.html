      <p>The traders' body alleged that these companies were circumventing the law and abusing Press Note No 2 of the government's foreign direct investment (FDI) policy.</p>
      <p>Khandelwal said the conference has chalked out a roadmap for its nationwide agitation from November 13, which will be observed as "National Awareness Campaign Day" when traders delegations across the country will submit an exhaustive memorandum to all MPs, urging them to raise the issue in Parliament.</p>
      <p>The first phase of nationwide agitation will be concluded with a three-day National Traders Convention -- to be held from 6 to 8 January in New Delhi -- which will be attended by trade leaders of about 20 thousand trade associations.</p>
      <p>National governing council of CAIT in association with other stakeholders will hold a meeting on January 9 and while taking stock of the situation will decide modalities of the second phase of its agitation.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
