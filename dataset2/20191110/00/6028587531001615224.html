      <p>Balconies overlooking a sweeping cityscape; stunning bathroom suites; or maybe you want to learn how to capture hotel or resort exteriors after the sun sets? If you are a professional travel blogger or an influencer, your photos should look professional and be memorable to stand out in this now crowded field. Antonio Cuellar has been a <a href="https://antoniocuellarphotography.com/">luxury hotel and resorts photographer </a> creating some quite spectacular images of the world's most incredible luxury hotels and resorts for many years. When photographing hotels, there are many factors to consider, from angles, gear, lighting, to finding the best levels to capture important architectural lines. Here is Antonio’s essential guide to photographing your next hotel travel adventure:</p>

        <b>Essential Gear</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are interested in producing professional images, you will need to invest in a certain amount of equipment. When photographing interiors, you generally need to use a wide-angle lens. To provide the maximum coverage, you will need a wide-angle lens in combination with a full-frame sensor camera. Most camera manufacturers produce full-frame sensor cameras. If architecture and interiors photography is something you want to pursue seriously, I would recommend purchasing a 24mm tilt and shift lens, and 60 percent of photographers who work in the architecture and interiors field use this type of lens. Another piece of equipment that is essential when producing serious images is a sturdy tripod. The most obvious reason is that most interiors and architectural photography require a longer shutter speed and a tripod will prevent camera shake. Further reasons for using a tripod will be illuminated below:</p>

        <b>Use a level</b>
      </p>
      <p>You must use a level for hotel and interiors photography. Having the correct levels in your photography is a defining difference that distinguishes amateurs from pros. Most modern cameras have a built-in level, so there is no excuse for crooked architectural lines in your images. Ensuring that your images have a level is another reason to use a tripod as not having one would make this extremely difficult to achieve.</p>

        <b>Avoid going too wide</b>
      </p>
      <p>As an amateur, it is natural to try to go as wide as possible so you can capture all the elements in the room. Although this is not entirely crazy, it can result in many problems with your images. It is interesting to note that many hotels prefer that you don't go any wider than 24mm as this approach can create a false sense of space, making the room look more significant than what it actually is. If you want to go wide, be careful to avoid furniture or compositional elements too close to the edge of the frame as this can lead to a distortion of their shape. </p>

        <b>Go low when you can</b>
      </p>
      <p>Something that I always recommend is to go low when you can. As a rule of thumb, shooting from a hip height is my starting point. Shooting from a position that is lower than your eyesight automatically creates a different and unusual line of sight that can make the image slightly more interesting. Additionally, and referring to our previous point, shooting low will assist with any furniture or elements in the frame looking less distorted. However, shooting low is not always possible, especially if you are trying to capture larger spaces effectively, like this shot I took of a suite at the <a href="https://www.mandarinoriental.com/">Mandarin Oriental, New York</a>. Then I recommend placing the camera a little higher, which will allow all spaces in the room to come back into the frame, allowing you to get a better feel for all the areas in the room.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Composition is key</b>
      </p>
      <p>In architectural and interiors photography, your vertical lines must always be straight. Also, if you are producing a one-point perspective image, both vertical and horizontal lines must be straight. Both one-point perspective and two-point perspectives have their place, and they can be equally beautiful, depending on what spaces you are shooting. When it comes to shooting a two-point perspective, make sure you shoot at an angle greater than 30 degrees. This way, it will look like you intended to shoot a two-point perspective, and you will avoid the viewer thinking your image is a poorly executed one-point perspective.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Don’t forget camera aperture</b>
      </p>
      <p>Use your camera at an aperture of f8 or smaller. Contrary to what common sense would indicate, by smaller, I mean a higher number such as f9 or f11. Combining a small aperture with accurate focusing can result in ultra-sharp images that are mandatory in the commercial world. There are occasions, mostly when shooting exteriors, where the first element you wish to capture is at a substantial distance away from you. This instance is when you can get away with using wider apertures. Smaller apertures require longer shutter speeds, and this is another reason why a sturdy tripod is mandatory. I wouldn't suggest going wider than f5.6. I rarely go wider than f11 unless I am photographing interiors with people, and often then decide to compromise between shutter speed and sharpness.</p>

        <b>Use correct lighting</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many real estate photographers make a living without using artificial lighting. They use a method called HDR, where they combine multiple exposures into one image. HDR software has continued to improve since its creation, and it is now at a point where it creates images of a high enough standard that some pros use them. HDR is my recommended method for travel bloggers or influencers since the more professional method described below will, most likely, require the help of assistants increasing your production costs.</p>

      <p>Most professional interiors photographers, including myself, use strobes as their preferred method of artificial lighting. The trick is to use artificial lights in a way that the viewer is only able to see natural light and is unable to detect any artificial lighting. The best way to achieve this is by using a method called motivated lighting. Make sure you place your strobes close to existing light sources to create the effect that the light is coming from the existing source, and this will allow images to look more natural. Using strobes can be challenging because when photographing interiors, you need to use wide-angle lenses, and it is highly likely the actual strobe will end up in the frame. Shooting multiple images on a tripod with and without strobes will become a crucial skill so that you can compost a final image that includes the lit segments of the shot without the strobes.</p>
