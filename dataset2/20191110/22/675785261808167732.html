      <p>A star of hit comedy Derry Girls has warned against using cube plugs after one at her bedside sparked a devastating blaze.</p>
      <p>Siobhan McSweeney, who plays austere nun Sister Michael in the Channel 4 series, was fortunately out of her flat when the multi-plug malfunctioned.</p>
      <p>Firefighters arrived at the Belfast property and chopped down her front door to discover the whole flat filled with "acrid smoke".</p>
      <p>The flames were so hot they cracked the property's windows, <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/tv/derry-girls-star-siobhan-mcsweeney-17232974">Belfast Live reported.</a></p>

      <p>A fire chief told McSweeney her a cube double adaptor had fallen a small way out of its socket and created an electrical arc.</p>
      <p>This in turn had sparked and caused the fire to take hold.</p>
      <p>She told her 40,000 followers on <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter:</a>  “I’ve got some bad news. Last night my flat went on fire. Thankfully I was out at a stupid play otherwise it could have been a worse story.</p>

      <p>"The fire alarms alerted my neighbours and thankfully they’re all safe too.</p>
      <p>“Their kindness last night was an extraordinary thing. The thought of something happening to them makes me feel even more nauseous. Lovely old buildings and their thick walls.</p>
      <p>“Two fire brigades arrived, chopped down my new front door to discover the whole flat in acrid smoke and my bedroom so hot it had cracked the windows."</p>

      <p>Perhaps most alarmingly, the plug had fallen less than 2mm out of the socket.</p>
      <p>“It had smouldered through my mattress and created such a heat it has melted the fire alarms and the fuse box in the hall next door," the actor continued.</p>
      <p>"(The fire chief) assured me it wasn’t my fault.”</p>
      <p>McSweeney, who grew up in Cork and has also starred in Dave's Porters, urged people with cube plugs to ditch them.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve called my brother and he had a few in the house. Now the bin. Please please get rid of them.</p>
      <p>"They are structured badly and it only takes a mm for there to be a spark.”</p>
