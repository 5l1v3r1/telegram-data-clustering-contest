      <p>Jeff Mayweather has told Shannon Briggs to "get the f*** out of here" after Logan Paul lost his rematch to KSI by a split decision.</p>
      <p>Mayweather, who is the uncle of unbeaten five-weight world champion Floyd Mayweather, was present to see the second meeting between the Youtube rivals in Los Angeles on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The former IBO super-featherweight champion was part of KSI's coaching team for the fight while Briggs was in Paul's corner.</p>
      <p>Briggs, who won 60 of his 68 fights as a heavyweight, was at the centre of the build-up to the highly-anticipated bout and stole the limelight when he clashed with coach Viddal Riley at Friday's weigh-in.</p>
      <p>And Mayweather gave a scathing verdict of 47-year-old after watching the Brit take victory in the fight.</p>

      <p>When asked about about the future of the rivalry between Paul and KSI, he told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmeUy_KenQY">iFL TV</a> : "It should be over now."</p>
      <p>“All the b******* that Shannon was saying – get the f*** out of here.</p>
      <p>“He’s not relevant anymore. What is he going to talk about now?”</p>
      <p>After fighting to a controversial draw in their first meeting last year, KSI was victorious over his American rival after six rounds.</p>

      <p>The fight was not without controversy though, with Paul deducted two points in the fourth round after being found to have punched the British Youtuber after he had been knocked down.</p>
      <p>It turned out that the two points were crucial, as he lost 56-55 on the third and final judge's decisive scorecard.</p>
      <p>One judge scored the fight 56-55 in favour of Paul, the other scored it 57-54 in favour of KSI, before the final and decisive card ensured the split decision result.</p>

      <p>But Mayweather felt the final outcome was the correct one, adding: "I don't think it should have been a split decision. I think he [KSI] should have won easily.</p>
      <p>"First of all, you took two points and he won the first three rounds - that's five points. Logan Paul could only win by knockout.</p>
      <p>"But for some reason, one judge gave him the fight - those two points deserved to be deducted."</p>
