      <h1>Leicester fans reach for the pitchforks after heavy loss to recently promoted London Irish</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:10:30+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>The mood down at Welford Road has quickly soured after Leicester’s poor start to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> resulted in a heavy 36-11 defeat at the hands of the recently promoted London Irish.</p>
      <p>After surviving a relegation battle last year, the Tigers have won one from their opening four games, sitting last on the Premiership ladder with the worst points differential in the league.</p>
      <p>Leicester fans described the away loss to the Exiles as a ‘pathetic performance’, ‘atrocious’ and ’embarrassing’. Many fans called for the resignation of ex-player Geordan Murphy, who took over the side after the sacking of Matt O’Connor early last season, and questioned the performance of chief executive Simon Cohen who is ‘killing the biggest club on the planet’.</p>

      <p>The Tigers are headed for another relegation battle and look squarely in the firing line based on the first month of the competition. The outcome of the salary cap punishment for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> will be closely followed by Tigers’ fans, which will no doubt play a part in deciding their future this season.</p>
      <p>Leicester were always going to be up for a tough away match with the recently re-stocked <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish">London Irish</a> outfit signing a host of internationals such as former All Black <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders/players/waisake-naholo/">Waisake Naholo</a> who scored in his debut for the club. Former Wallabies <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/waratahs/players/curtis-rona/">Curtis Rona</a> and Nic Phipps along with South African <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks/players/ruan-botha/">Ruan Botha</a> brought some much-needed firepower to the Exiles roster.</p>
      <p>Tigers’ fans can’t welcome back the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> internationals soon enough to turn the season around.</p>
