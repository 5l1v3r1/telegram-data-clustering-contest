      <h2>School days should be happy, yet children with mental health issues are being abandoned with callous indifference</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:24:53+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>Labour and Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to invest £845million, guaranteeing the most vulnerable receive support and specialist help, would right a scandalous Tory wrong.</p>
      <p>Seeing mental and physical health as equally important for a person to fulfill their potential is a landmark stance by Labour.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives regularly announced parity of treatment but this never happened. No wonder millions have given up on hollow words from the NHS-undermining Tories.</p>
      <p>Worried parents must pin their faith in Labour to transform mental health services. Never doubt Mr Corbyn’s commitment on this issue. He understands and is concerned about the suffering inflicted by poor mental health and poorer, underfunded services.</p>
      <p>We can do better. We just require a party in power prepared to do better for us.</p>

      <h3>Flood aid.. now</h3>
      <p>Flooded homeowners, tenants and business owners deserve more than sympathy. What they really need is help.</p>
      <p>This national disaster must be declared an emergency – with financial assistance from central funds so lives can be restarted.</p>
      <p>This Southern Tory government is ignoring the devastated families and entrepreneurs in the North of England. If this tragedy was in Surrey or Sussex it would be very different.</p>
      <p>Lessons need to be learned to avoid future flooding but, more urgently, swamped houses and buildings need to be dried, cleaned, repaired and renovated. There is no time to waste. Let’s see the colour of the Tories’ money.</p>
      <h3>Honour unites</h3>
      <p>The dignity of those at Remembrance Sunday services honouring the nation’s war dead was touching.</p>
      <p>During a divisive election campaign and the often poisonous debate over Brexit, let us recall that more unites than divides us.</p>
