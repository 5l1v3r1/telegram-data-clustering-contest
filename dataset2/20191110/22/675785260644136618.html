      <h1>Jamie Vardy compared to Cristiano Ronaldo after Leicester beat Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>Jamie Vardy set up one and scored another against Arsenal to return to the top of the Premier League scoring charts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Ricardo Pereira reckons Jamie Vardy is as “ruthless” up front as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> ’s Portuguese right-back Pereira is international team-mates with Ronaldo, who has scored more than 600 career goals.</p>
      <p>Former Non-League hitman Vardy was a comparatively late starter but now has 91 Premier League goals after helping City beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> 2-0 with his 11th this term.</p>
      <p>Pereira said: “They are very different people but they are both ruthless in front of goal.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to have a player like that. When he has a chance he scores.</p>

      <p>“In some games where we don’t have many chances, it’s important to take them and score one goal.</p>
      <p>“In some games the small details make the difference. We are happy to have him.”</p>
      <p>Pereira was one of several outstanding Leicester players against the Gunners as he was solid defensively and got forward to help tee up the opener.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers’ side now have the best defensive record in the Premier League after letting in only eight goals.</p>
      <p>Pereira added: “It not only the back four, it’s the whole team, it’s another good thing not to concede a lot.”</p>

      <p>The win over Arsenal boosted Leicester's top four chances but Brendan Rodgers insists a title challenge is unlikely.</p>
      <p>“I suppose we have thrown a hand grenade right into the middle of the top four.</p>
      <p>“But we're not thinking about the title race. We're thinking about developing a team and improving the players. That is our only focus.</p>
      <p>“Our job is to hope to be in the top four. I said when I came here that it would be great to play European football.</p>
