      <p>MUMBAI: The United States Court of Appeals in its recent order has concurred with the views of ‘Save Jobs USA’ that granting of work permits (employment authorisations) to spouses of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/h-1b-visa">H-1B visa</a> holders increases competition for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/American-jobs">American jobs</a>. As spouses are able to work, it provides an incentive to the H-1B visa holders to continue to stay in the US.</p>
      <p>It is not an absolute victory for this group of American tech workers who had filed the suit, as the Court of Appeals has not rescinded the employment authorisation policy. Instead, the court has remanded the matter to a lower court to decide the case on merits.</p>
      <p>The case was filed in April 2015, by Save Jobs USA, a group of American technology employees who had lost their jobs to H-1B visa holders. This group had challenged a regulation which enabled certain categories of spouses of H-1B workers to obtain employment authorisation.</p>

      <p>Spouses of H-1B workers hold a dependent visa, which is the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/H-4-visa">H-4 visa</a>. This visa does not give them the right to work. Given the decade-long wait for obtaining green cards especially by Indians, the Obama administration had introduced a policy enabling spouses (in certain instances, such as those who were waiting for a green card) to work by obtaining an employment authorisation document (EAD).</p>
      <p>The Appellate Court’s order is mixed news for the 80,000 plus spouses of Indian H-1B holders who hold an EAD. For now, they can continue to work if they hold an EAD and can even apply for a new EAD or renew an existing one. “Yet, uneasiness over our future prevails,” says an EAD holder.</p>
      <p>“The Court of Appeals’ order, has given Save Jobs USA, the standing to challenge the EAD rule. The decision does not impact the H-4 EAD rule,” says Cyrus Mehta, a New York-based immigration attorney.</p>
      <p>The crux of the matter which will now be examined by the lower court is whether the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) has the authority to give EADs to H-4 visa holders.</p>
      <p>But, the sword of Damocles continues to sway over the families where the spouse holds an EAD, as the Trump administration in the course of court hearings had reiterated the intent to rescind the EAD policy. In its letter to the court, DHS had stated that a proposed rule to rescind the EAD program could be published earliest by spring 2020. Typically, post publication of the rule, it takes a few months for the new policy to come into effect.</p>
      <p>If the finding by the lower court is that DHS acted beyond its scope in granting EAD or the policy is rescinded by the Trump government, it will adversely impact many Indian families (TOI has earlier reported on this aspect).</p>
