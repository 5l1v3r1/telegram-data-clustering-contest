      <p>On Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci accused President Donald Trump of committing “full-blown traitorous activity.”</p>
      <p>Scaramucci said, “I think it’s not just a Ukrainian call. There will be other elements of the story that unfold where people say wait a minute. There’s a combination of incompetence. There’s a combination of a destruction of the executive branch of the United States. In addition to the lawlessness and traitorous-like behavior.”</p>
      <p>Stelter asked, “Traitorous-like behavior?”</p>
      <p>Scaramucci said, “Oh, there’s no question.”</p>
      <p>Stelter said, “Strong word.”</p>
      <p>Scaramucci said, “What word would you use? You’re on the phone with the president of the Ukraine, and you’re strong-arming him to have him go after your political opponent? That is, you’ve become a traitor of the Constitution and a traitor to the laws of the United States. Do you want to pretend that it’s not traitorous behavior? We can pretend that it isn’t, and we can continue to gaslight.”</p>
      <p>He added, “We have to call him into account for what is going on. This is full-blown traitorous activity.”</p>
