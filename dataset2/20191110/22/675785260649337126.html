      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:52:33+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Even <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michelle-keegan">Michelle Keegan</a> enjoys a McDonald's takeaway every now and again.</p>
      <p>And the Our Girl beauty, 32, tucked into her late night treat on her cheat day and she broadcast her fast food cravings to her 4.1million followers on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In the snap, the Corrie star curled up in the back of the car as she clutched her McDonald's close to her chest.</p>
      <p>The Brassic star was holding not one but two big brown paper bags from the fast food chain.</p>
      <p>Set out next to her were three sour cream dips to add extra flavour.</p>

      <p>Michelle washed it down with a cold beverage which she was holding while she posed for the cheeky picture.</p>
      <p>She wrote in the caption: "Keep what you love close, and your filet-o-fish even closer."</p>
      <p>Michelle was once voted the TV star with the best body in 2014.</p>

      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star beat curvy beauties <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/beyonce">Beyonce</a> to the hot trophy in 2014.</p>
      <p>So it may surprise fans the actress often enjoys a Chinese takeaway on a Saturday night with her husband Mark Wright.</p>
      <p>As well as her once-a-week cheat night, the brunette bombshell confessed one of her favourite food groups is cheese.</p>
      <p>She previously said: “One of my favourite foods is cheese and I love having a Chinese on a Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“I think it is healthy to have a relaxed approach and balanced outlook.”</p>
