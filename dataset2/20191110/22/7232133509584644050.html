      <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is about to see a massive bout of volatility, according to a long-term technical indicator. Sure, the leading cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/26/bitcoin-price-tapped-10600-in-fourth-largest-bull-move-ever/">spiked by 42% two weeks back</a>, surging from $7,300 to $10,500 seemingly on the news that China’s President was calling for the formal adoption of blockchain technologies. But, something bigger is purportedly brewing.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin Volatility on Its Way</h3>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/TrueCrypto28/status/1191380849947742208">recent analysis</a> of the one-week BTC chart by trader Mr. Anderson, a massive Bitcoin move is brewing. He noted that while it’s easy to get caught up in the “flashes of volatility” on lower time frames, a key indicator signals an even larger, extended move for the cryptocurrency market.</p>
      <p>The indicator in question is the one-week Bollinger Band Width (BBW) indicator — an indicator that shows the width between the highest and lowest Bollinger Bands, which itself is a tool used to determine ranges.</p>
      <p>Right now, the indicator has reached 0.42, or really long-term volatility. The last time this indicator interacted with this BBW range was in late-March — just a week before Bitcoin shot from $4,000 to $5,000 in the shocking move that kicked off this year’s micro bull market.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The BBW also was under the 0.40 range just a week or two before Bitcoin crashed in November 2018, when the previous bull run began in October 2016, and a few months prior to Bitcoin breaking past $100 for the first time ever in 2013.</p>
      <p>In other words, a long-term Bitcoin price trend is soon to form.</p>

      <h3>Up or Down?</h3>
      <p>Of course, this may leave you wondering — will Bitcoin continue its bull trend higher or return to a bear market state?</p>
      <p>According to the seeming consensus of analysts, a resumption of the bull trend earlier this year is more likely than not. As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/01/analyst-bitcoin-more-likely-to-surge-50-to-14000-than-fall/">reported by NewsBTC previously</a>, Trader <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHornHairs">HornHairs</a> has noted that he “likes the chance we hit $14,000 before $7,000.” He remarked in a recent tweet that with Bitcoin bouncing strong and holding above the one-month bullish breaker, the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement of the entire cycle, the Point of Control as defined by the volume profile, and the yearly pivot, BTC is leaning rather bullish.</p>

      <p>Also, trader and CoinTelegraph contributor FilbFilb found that by the end of November or start of December, the 50-week and 100-week moving averages <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/31/bitcoin-see-collosal-golden-cross-2019-precede-price-boom/">will see a “golden cross,”</a> which he claims is far more significant” for the Bitcoin market that other technical crosses.</p>
