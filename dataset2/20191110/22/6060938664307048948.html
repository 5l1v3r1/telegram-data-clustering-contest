      <p>Besides e-commerce, beauty is also seeing an increase in the number of homegrown skincare and cosmetic brands, latest among them being Grofers’ own Orange Something and Mahesh Bhupati-backed Scentials. With increasing activity in the high-margin business, investors are placing bets in this category.</p>
      <p>“Consumers are becoming increasingly aware today and do not subscribe to a one-size-fits-all approach offered by traditional, off-the-shelf products. When it comes to personal care and beauty, they want a unique solution and a perfect look that works for them. We are keen to back founders and brands with a clear plan for sustainable and profitable growth, and have put in money on Bare Anatomy, which builds a long-term relationship with the customer,” said Manu Chandra, managing partner, Sauce.VC</p>
