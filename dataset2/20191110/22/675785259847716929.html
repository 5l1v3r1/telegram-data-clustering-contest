      <h1>Alexandre Lacazette lifts lid on mood in Arsenal dressing room amid Unai Emery pressure</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal were beaten 2-0 by Leicester on Saturday as the pressure increases on boss Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette admits Arsenal are low on confidence as the pressure grows on boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners’ record of 17 points and a minus-one goal difference is their worst start to a top-flight season after 12 games since 1982-83.</p>
      <p>They had just one shot on target in this match from Lacazette in the 20th minute as skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang later had a goal ruled offside.</p>
      <p>Emery’s men are now winless in their last five Premier League away games and have just one win in seven games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Striker Lacazette said: “We miss confidence and we need the international break. I hope we are going to come back well. We need to work more than we do now to find confidence.</p>

      <p>“We are very disappointed, we had chances in the first half. We couldn’t score and you need to take your chances in this type of game.</p>
      <p>“We have to work again and keep working everyday. But I think we didn’t play so bad, we just missed our chances in the first half.”</p>
      <p>Defeat leaves <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> below promoted Sheffield United well off the pace in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>

      <p>The French striker added: “We want to be top four of course.</p>
      <p>“Now we are nine points behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and it is going to be hard but everything is possible in football.</p>
      <p>“We still have time until the end of the season. We are going to work to come back.”</p>
