      <p>The 38-year-old Swiss, bidding for his seventh title at the event but his first since 2011, struggled to handle Thiem’s aggressive game as he went down 7-5 7-5.</p>
      <p>Only once in 16 previous appearances has Federer failed to survive the group phase, in 2008, and to avoid a repeat he will have to beat Italian Matteo Berrettini on Tuesday and most probably Novak Djokovic on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Djokovic, aiming to claw back the year-end number one ranking from Rafael Nadal, destroyed debutant Berrettini 6-2 6-1 in the day’s opening singles match at the O2 Arena.</p>
      <p>Thiem put constant pressure on Federer and broke at 5-5 in each set to claim his third win over the Swiss this year.</p>
      <p>“My forecast, it’s a normal tournament from here on forward,” 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer, beaten by Djokovic in an epic Wimbledon final in July, said.</p>
      <p>“Not allowed to lose anymore for me. That’s how it is every week of the year for the last 20 years, so from that standpoint there is nothing new there.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to recover, I’ve got make sure I play better than today, and hopefully I can win that match (against Berrettini).”</p>
      <p>The warning signs were there in Federer’s opening service game which he dropped and although he hit back impressively he faltered at 5-5 when Thiem hurried him into errors.</p>
      <p>Federer had the majority of support in the packed arena but, try as he might, he could not find his A game in the second set as Thiem again dominated the baseline rallies.</p>
      <p>Thiem, who has flourished this year since hiring coach Nicolas Massu after a slow start to the season, broke again at 5-5 and although Federer fought hard and had a point to take the set into a tiebreak he was unable to turn things around.</p>
      <p>“I thought he played a tough first-round performance today, and my game was probably just not good enough, and the start didn’t help,” Federer said.</p>
      <p>Thiem will face Djokovic on Tuesday.</p>
