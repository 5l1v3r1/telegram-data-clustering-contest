      <h1>Stephen Robinson hails Motherwell kids for resilient display against Celtic</h1>
      <h2>The Fir Park gaffer insisted his side could hold their heads high despite slumping to defeat at Parkhead.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:43:24+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:43</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Stephen Robinson hailed his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> kids for holding their own against Celtic.</p>
      <p>The Fir Park gaffer insisted his side could hold their heads high despite slumping to defeat at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>Robinson’s starting XI was wrecked in the build up when skipper Peter Hartley joined the crock list alongside key men such as Liam Donnelly and Charles Dunne.</p>
      <p>Robinson said: “When you lose you captain on the day of the game and your top goalscorer in Liam Donnelly, who also gives us that defensive backbone, of course.</p>
      <p>“I asked Richard Tait to come in and do a job at the left of the back three because we’d worked all week on a shape and he was terrific, as was Barry Maguire.</p>

      <p>“That’s where we are as a football club we have to put young kids into the team.</p>
      <p>“They are bringing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-christie">Ryan Christie</a> on, we’re bringing on kids.</p>
      <p>“The positive aspects though certainly outweigh any negativity.</p>
      <p>“I take things from the performance, but not the result. We are never happy getting beat.</p>
      <p>“I have to give a lot of credit to the players, they worked their socks off for me.</p>
      <p>“I thought we were very good on the ball from the back to the middle, and I put two attacking subs on to try and got for it.</p>
      <p>“We go away, take the positives and we learn again. At Rangers we lost a goal from our free-kick too.</p>
      <p>“We’ll go on to the next set of games with a positive mind-set.”</p>

      <p>Motherwell went behind early but never buckled and even when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> went two up they were still in the game.</p>
      <p>Robinson said: “I thought it was a good performance. Our shape worked well and we contained them a lot, and we had a threat on the counter.</p>
      <p>“We had some good performances, Devante Cole was terrific, Bevis Mugabi, young Barry Maguire making only his second start of the season.</p>
      <p>“We limited Celtic to an own goal, and we had the free-kick that they scored the first one from and put it in the goalkeeper’s hands and then it’s a defensive error after that.</p>
      <p>“We got punished, Declan Gallagher intercept the ball and Edouard puts it in the top corner, that’s the level you’re up against.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of positives for us, we were very organised and the boys carried it out to the letter.</p>
      <p>“Could we have held more of a threat in the final third? Yeah, but they wear you down.</p>
      <p>“You don’t beat Lazio if you’re not a top-class side.”</p>

      <p>Well defender Gallagher was unfortunate in the build up to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> ’s opener but he has been backed by his boss to shine with Scotland this week.</p>
      <p>Robinson said: “I think Declan Gallagher showed that he is right in the mix.</p>
      <p>“Steve will be well aware of that and may well have been at the game. He knows how well he has been doing.</p>
      <p>“He has improved no end. He’s a very good footballer and he’s at the top of his game.”</p>
