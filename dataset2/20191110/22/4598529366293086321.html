      <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has reportedly signed a book deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/media/john-bolton-book-deal/index.html">CNN</a> and the <a href="https://apnews.com/9d2af632621f453595b9cf3643b936bd">Associated Press</a> reported on Saturday that Bolton had signed with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster after several weeks of negotiations.</p>
      <p>Unnamed publishing officials told the AP the deal was worth approximately $2 million.</p>
      <p>Though the exact release date is unknown, an anonymous source told CNN the book will be published before the 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>House impeachment investigators are eager to hear from Bolton after several testimonies from White House officials point to the former national security adviser as a resister in President Donald Trump’s efforts to use foreign policy to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on his political rivals.</p>
      <p>However, Bolton <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bolton-impeachment-inquiry-testimony">skipped</a> his scheduled deposition on Thursday because he wants a judge to decide whether he and his former deputy, Charles Kupperman, are allowed to defy the White House’s orders to not cooperate with the impeachment investigation.</p>
