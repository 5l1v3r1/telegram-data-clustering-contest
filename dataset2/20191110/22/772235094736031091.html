      <p><b>Holden</b> has recalled the <b>2019-20 Commodore</b> and <b>Astra,</b> over concerns about a problem with the rear seat crossmember.</p>
      <p>According to the company, the rear seat crossmember could have been improperly welded to the seat frame. If a car with the issue is involved in a rear-end accident, there's an increased risk passengers will be injured.</p>
      <p>A total of 131 cars are included in the campaign â€“ a VIN list is <a href="https://www.productsafety.gov.au/system/files/VIN%20list_282.xlsx"><b>attached here</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Holden will contact owners of the affected cars and advise them to organise a free fix with their nearest dealer.</p>
