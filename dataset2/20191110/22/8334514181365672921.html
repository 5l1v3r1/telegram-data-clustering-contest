      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain’s far-right Vox, on Sunday said he wanted to build a “patriotic alternative” for the country, after support for his party surged in a general election.</p>
      <p>With nearly 99% of votes counted, Vox had won 52 seats in Spain’s 350-seat parliament, more than doubling its result from the previous election in April.</p>
      <p>Abscal gave no details of what alliances such a “patriotic alternative” could entail.</p>
