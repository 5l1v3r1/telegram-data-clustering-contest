      <p>VANCOUVER — The New Jersey Devils scored goals 22 seconds apart in the first period then used some key stops by goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood to defeat the Vancouver Canucks 2-1 Sunday.</p>
      <p>Wayne Simmonds, on the power play, and Jesper Bratt scored for the Devils (5-7-4). Blackwood made 30 saves.</p>
      <p>Brock Boeser, on a power play, scored for the Canucks (9-6-3), who are winless in their last four games (0-3-1).</p>
      <p>The Canucks are also 0-8-3 in their last 11 games against New Jersey.</p>
      <p>The Devils had lost their two previous games but are 5-3-2 in their last 10.</p>
      <p>Canuck goaltender Jacob Markstrom stopped 25 shots.</p>

      <p>Early in the third period Blackwood stopped Vancouver’s Tanner Pearson on a rush, then watched as the rebound went wide of the net. Later he used his stick to steer a Boeser blast wide. In the second period Blackwood made a pad save on an Adam Gaudette shot.</p>
      <p>It took less then 30 seconds for the Devils to build a 2-0 lead in the first period.</p>
      <p>Simmonds opened the scoring at 11:48. Taylor Hall sent a pass into the Canucks zone that Kyle Palmieri directed to Simmonds. He put it past Markstrom for the Devils’ second road power-play goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Bratt quickly made it 2-0 at 12:10 when he deflected a Damon Severson point shot into the net for his fourth goal of the season.</p>
      <p>The Canucks had dodged a bullet a few minutes earlier on a Devils power play. Hall redirected a puck that got by Markstrom and slowly slid toward the open corner before defenceman Tyler Myers swept it off the goal line.</p>
      <p>Boeser’s goal at 12:40 of the second period made the score 2-1. He took J.T. Miller’s pass, used his speed to skate into the Devils zone, then beat Blackwood with a low shot to the far corner. The goal came a few minutes after Markstrom had stopped Hall on a breakaway.</p>
      <p>It was the second head-to-head brother clash between Vancouver’s Quinn Hughes, the 20-year-old defenceman picked seventh overall in the 2018 draft, and Jack Hughes, the 18-year-old centre picked No. 1 by the Devils in this year’s draft. In an Oct. 19 meeting Jack Hughes scored his first NHL goal in the Devils 1-0 win over the Canucks.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Quinn Hughes earned an assist on Boeser’s goal while Jack was kept off the scoresheet.</p>
