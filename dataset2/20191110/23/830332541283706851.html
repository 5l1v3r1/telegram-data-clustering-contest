      <p>TOMS RIVER, New Jersey (CNN) - Two people died Sunday in New Jersey after their speeding car lost control, launched off an embankment and flew into the second story of a building, police said.</p>
      <p>The car, a red Porsche Boxster convertible, was "traveling at a high rate of speed" when it hit a median and eventually crash-landed into the second-story offices of Exit Realty Elite, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4sn-vFgcOT/?igshid=1nfgppoxpce3x">Toms River Police said</a>.</p>
      <p>The car was driven by Braden DeMartin, 22, police said. DeMartin and his passenger, 23-year-old Daniel Foley -- both of Toms River -- were pronounced dead at the scene, according to police.</p>
      <p>The two are believed to have been the only occupants of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>The building, which the real estate agency shares with a software company and a family therapist, has been deemed "unsafe," police said.</p>
      <p>Isaac Kesserman, owner of the building, said no one was inside at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>The accident occurred on Hooper Avenue between Indian Hill Road and College Drive around 6:30 a.m. The area was shut down for about seven hours.</p>
      <p>The crash is currently under investigation by Toms River Traffic Safety officers.</p>
