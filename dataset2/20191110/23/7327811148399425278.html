      <p>CROWN HEIGHTS, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police are looking for the person who shattered the windows of a Yeshiva in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>Many people in the Jewish community say the vandalism is the latest in a string of incidents. Thankfully no one was injured, but many in Crown Heights are left upset over the broken windows.</p>
      <p>Officials say the incident happened shortly after 8 p.m. Friday. They say someone smashed two ground-level windows at the Bais Rivkah Lefferts Yeshiva, located on the corner of Lefferts Ave and Brooklyn Ave.</p>
      <p>The Yeshiva is a girls' school for the Hasidic community, and every day there are many students coming and going. No girls were inside the religious school at the time of the broken windows.</p>
      <p>Devorah Halberstam's son, Ari was murdered on the Brooklyn Bridge in an act of terrorism in 1994. His mother told Eyewitness News that these crimes cannot be ignored.</p>
      <p>Halberstam explained that while the pain of losing a child never goes away, it is important to understand why someone would do this in the first place.</p>
      <p>Police are currently not treating this as a bias incident.</p>
