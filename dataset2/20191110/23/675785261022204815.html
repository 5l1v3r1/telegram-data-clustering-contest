      <h1>Maurizio Sarri on Cristiano Ronaldo situation after Juventus star 'leaves stadium early'</h1>
      <h2>Ronaldo appeared to give Sarri 'a dirty look' after being hooked but Juventus boss says injury has been limiting his performance levels</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:46:24+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri has clarified why Cristiano Ronaldo was hauled off during Juventus' 1-0 win over AC Milan amid reports the Portuguese star left the stadium early.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-storms-after-being-20856648">reacted angrily after being withdrawn early in the second half</a> following a below-par performance on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It was the second game in a row in which he had been substituted, and as he left the pitch the 34-year-old stormed past Juventus boss Sarri and straight down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Reports claimed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> gave Sarri 'a dirty look' before leaving the Allianz Stadium three minutes before the final whistle</p>
      <p>Sarri's decision was vindicated by the fact that Ronaldo's replacement Paulo Dybala scored the winner to send <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> back to the top of the Serie A table.</p>

      <p>It was a similar situation during Wednesday's Champions League match at Lokomotiv Moscow, with Douglas Costa scoring a last-gasp winner for Juve <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/maurizio-sarri-explains-cristiano-ronaldos-20829888">after Ronaldo had looked unhappy at being taken off</a> .</p>
      <p>Now Sarri has confirmed why Ronaldo was hooked for the second game in succession - saying he has been playing with an injury which is limiting his performance levels.</p>
      <p>Sarri said: "Over the last month Cristiano has had this knee problem, he had a knock in training and it hurt the collateral ligament.</p>
      <p>"When he trains at or plays, it unbalances him, so he ends up overcompensating and it damages the calf and thigh muscles. It is affecting his performances."</p>

      <p>Two successive substitutions have not gone down well with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> ace Ronaldo, however.</p>
      <p>As he left the pitch on Sunday he gave Sarri a dirty look and muttered something under his breath, according to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/cristiano-ronaldo-angered-substitution-juventus-milan">Guardian</a> .</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146308/ronaldo-left-juventus-stadium-early">Football Italia</a> reported that rather than stick around to support his teammates in a crucial Serie A clash, Ronaldo was gone from the stadium three minutes before the final whistle.</p>
      <p>On Ronaldo's reaction to his substitution against Milan, Sarri said: "It's not a problem. We must thank him because he made himself available to play in exceptional conditions, then I preferred to replace him.</p>
      <p>"If he gets angry its part of the normality of all the players, especially one who has made sacrifices to be there."</p>
