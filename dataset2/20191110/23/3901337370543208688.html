        <b>Serie A</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Juventus 1-0 AC Milan</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 10 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue</b>: Juventus Stadium</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was subbed off for a second game in a row, as Juventus registered a 1-0 win over AC Milan to reclaim top spot from Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Bianconeri boss Maurizio Sarri made five changes to the side that beat Lokomotiv Moscow in the UEFA Champions League in midweek, with defender Matthijs de Ligt returning to partner Leonardo Bonucci in the heart of defence, while Dybala had to contend with a place on the bench.</p>
      <p>Juventus were nearly punished for a slow start in the 16th minute after Suso delivered a delightful cross into the box but the unmarked Krzysztof Piatek glanced his header over the bar from close range.</p>
      <p>The home side had to wait until the final five minutes of the half for their first real opening after Ronaldo unleashed a shot that was saved by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, while Wojciech Szczesny did well to deny Piatek at the other end minutes later.</p>
      <p>Juventus were finding it difficult to break down the Rossoneri defence after the break and Sarri made a big call ten minutes into the second stanza by bringing on Dybala in place of Ronaldo, who ran straight down the tunnel after being taken off.</p>
      <p>Sarri's surprise substitution was vindicated with 13 minutes remaining after Dybala finally broke the deadlock with a shot into the bottom corner after weaving his way into the Milan box.</p>
      <p>Hakan Calhanoglu almost levelled matters for Rossoneri with seven minutes remaining after latching onto a loose ball on the far side but his shot was saved by Szczesny, as Juventus held for the win on to move a point clear at the top of the table while Milan dropped to 14th.</p>
