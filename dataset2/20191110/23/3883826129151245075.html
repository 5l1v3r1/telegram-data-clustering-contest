        <figcaption>Most of Monday's papers show the Queen at the annual Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in London, with the Mail's splash appearing to show Her Majesty wiping tears from her eyes as she watched the commemorations. The newspaper leads on a pledge by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to change the law to protect Northern Ireland veterans.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Daily Telegraph also carries a story on the Conservatives' pledge, which it claims will be included in the party's manifesto. The PM will promise to change the Human Rights Act to "provide a presumption against prosecution for historical offences" in order to bring an end to "the unfair trials" of soldiers, the paper says. It adds that the current draft of the party's manifesto includes a promise to end "ongoing... prosecutions".</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Times' front page focuses on Chancellor Sajid Javid defending Conservative claims over the cost of Labour's policies, which sparked a row. John McDonnell condemned the analysis, based on Labour's 2017 manifesto and further pledges made since, as "fake news". On Sunday, Mr Javid said the figures were a "reasonable" assessment of Labour's commitments to date.</figcaption>
