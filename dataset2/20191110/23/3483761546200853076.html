      <p>Newcastle City Choir has been hard at work learning beautiful four-part arrangements of well-known carols as well as some less that usual Christmas music in preparation for the festive season.</p>
      <p>In the spirit of Christmas giving, the choir is presenting a free mini concert at John Hunter Hospital by the piano next to the food service area on Wednesday, November 20 at 10.30am. The choir will also hold a fund-raising Christmas concert for Camp Quality at Mayfield Uniting Church on Sunday, December 15 at 2pm. Tickets are $15, available at the door. Afternoon tea is included.</p>
      <p>"Camp Quality's services and programs make a real difference in the lives of children facing cancer and in the lives of their families. By joining us for this festive season concert you can help make that difference," the choir stated.</p>
      <p>New members are welcome to join the choir which meets at Mayfield Uniting Church Hall on the first Wednesday of each month from 7pm.</p>
