      <p>PARIS, Nov 11 — French comic book writer Enki Bilal laps it up as he watches two proponents of his creation combine the cerebral nature of chess with the physicality of boxing in a “sporting” first.</p>
      <p>Bilal watched spellbound as Paris’s Cabaret Sauvage hosted France’s first “bout” of competitive chessboxing Saturday, nearly three decades after he first depicted the concept in his work.</p>
      <p>A sellout crowd turned up to watch as the competitors alternated brawn and brain, three-minute rounds of boxing giving way to mini-chess bouts across a maximum 11 rounds, the whole thing ending either with a knockout — or a checkmate.</p>
      <p>A DJ whips up the audience before the bare-chested protagonists, sweatshirts slung over their shoulders, enter the ring, escorted by their respective entourages.</p>
      <p>To drown out the noise of the partisan crowd, the “fighters” put headphones on as they survey the chessboard.</p>
      <p>“Move your pawn,” reads one supportive banner in a crowd of mainly 30-something fans.</p>
      <p>Shifting to not pulling punches, the rivals launch into battle, eschewing protective headgear.</p>
      <p>After three minutes of sweaty, adrenaline-fuelled action they return to the chessboard for some more brainy manoeuvring.</p>
      <p>“Passing from the violence of boxing to re-concentrating on chess is using the two most beautiful human capacities — intelligence and physical force,” Bilal told AFP, amused to see his concept leap from the pages of his comic books to become physical reality.</p>
      <p>Bilal came up with the idea while writing his <i>Froid Equateur</i> (<i>Cold Equator</i>) trilogy in 1992. Ten years on, Dutchman Iepe Rubingh actually organised a maiden fight and an international federation was created.</p>
      <p>Today, there are a dozen national federations with around 3,500 proponents.</p>
      <p>“When Iepe read the comic book he saw the sport straight away. Boxing is a noble art, with its rules and codes, its elegance — (it is) a form of beauty and, inexorably, strength, resistance and intelligence.</p>
      <p>“Chess is strategic, about mental (strength),” said Bilal, adding that he was thrilled to witness “the birth of chessboxing champions”.</p>
      <p>“Training for chess is also about mugging up on books. It’s worse than music theory. They’ve come up with something modern, a sport which blends all the human qualities, and there are precious few sports which do that.”</p>
      <p>As for Saturday’s card, the outcome was two technical knockouts and one checkmate. — AFP</p>
