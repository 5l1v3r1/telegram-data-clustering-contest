      <h1>Lam believes Bristol laid down a 'major marker' after comeback win at Exeter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:09:17+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Pat Lam described Bristol’s stunning victory at Exeter as a “major marker” for the season after his side came back from a 17-0 half-time deficit to win 20-17 at Sandy Park.</p>
      <p>Dan Thomas came on as a half-time replacement for the injured <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/jake-heenan/">Jake Heenan</a> and it was the 26-year-old flanker who was at the centre of a driving maul that crashed over the Chiefs’ line in the last minute to snatch victory for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol">Bristol</a> and take them to the top of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> table.</p>
      <p>Piers O’Conor scored the Bears’ other try, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/callum-sheedy/">Callum Sheedy</a> kicking two penalties and two conversions.</p>

      <p>Director of rugby Lam said: “This victory is huge in our growth as we didn’t beat <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale">Sale</a> or Exeter last year so to beat both was a real learning curve for us and a major marker.</p>
      <p>“Exeter are a power-reliant team and they were fully loaded today and to come here is a real mental and physical challenge.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t play our best rugby but we were top shelf in terms of attitude and commitment.</p>
      <p>“We gave away soft tries in the first half so the message at half-time was to start from scratch, stick to our systems and build the scoreboard.</p>

      <p>“We are proud to be top of the league but we are still gutted at throwing three points away at Harlequins.”</p>
      <p>Thomas said he was “over the moon” to help his side to the summit of the table but hailed Bristol’s attitude and resilience.</p>
      <p>“You have to challenge yourself when you come down here and when we went 17-0 down, our heads didn’t drop,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Their points came from our mistakes but our offloading game worked better for us in the second half and we stuck to our systems.</p>
      <p>“We were lucky to come out on top but I’m over the moon.”</p>
      <p>Exeter had built up a 17-0 lead through tries from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/sam-simmonds/">Sam Simmonds</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/nic-white/">Nic White</a> with seven points from the boot of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/joe-simmonds/">Joe Simmonds</a>, but <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> boss Rob Baxter was critical of his side’s second-half performance.</p>
      <p>He said: “We didn’t do ourselves justice today as it was just basic sloppiness.</p>
      <p>“We made silly mistakes and when the pressure came on as a result of Nic White’s yellow card, we made some really odd decisions.”</p>
      <p>Both bosses was asked about their view on Saracens’ fine and deduction of 35 points for breaching the salary cap.</p>
      <p>Lam said: “It’s all about having a level playing field and we would do anything like that as we do everything by the book.</p>
      <p>“We have one of the richest owners in Steve Lansdown but we won’t consider anything illegal and the rules are very clear about what you can and can’t do.”</p>
      <p>Baxter added: “It’s for other people to decide what Saracens’ fate is and we and the other 10 clubs should just focus on themselves.</p>
      <p>“Losing today was nothing to do with events off the field.”</p>
