      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:21:32+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Declan Donnelly broke down on his new documentary with best pal Anthony McPartlin as they discussed the last few years of Ant being in rehab.</p>
      <p>The presenting duo were inseparable until a broken Ant admitted himself into rehab in 2017 - and their friendship was hugely tested.</p>
      <p>In an emotional speech shown on their documentary, Ant said: "The last few years have been quite emotional, hard... they've been testing I would say how strong your love is, friendship is..."</p>
      <p>And Dec added: "It's been a tough couple of years it's really tested the bond we've shared since we were 13 years old.</p>
      <p>"I was incredibly angry at the start, so angry and disappointed in him that he didn't ever come to me and say I'm struggling, I need you because I thought if the shoe was on the other foot I would have gone to him said I'm in trouble and he never came to me and that hurt me a lot."</p>

      <p>Ant then admitted: "I knew he was angry and understandably so because my action not only affected home but him.</p>
      <p>"There was a point where I thought, 'That was it', there were times I wasn't sure it was gonna survive, times that you didn't know it needed to survive, you wanted it to survive.</p>
      <p>"Focusing on me and repairing relationships and being better person working out what was important."</p>
      <p>Talking about work, Dec revealed: "The thought of that filled me with absolute fear.</p>

      <p>"Ultimately you feel all those emotions and get to put where you go... all those feelings are bit selfish about what he was going through how bad he must have felt to be in that situation - that's when I got really sad and felt sympathetic towards him.</p>
      <p>"He must have been so unhappy and that's where the care and compassion you have for that person overrides all those emotions and you want them to get well. More than anything I just wanted him to be happy."</p>
      <p>Ant gushed over his long-time BFF Dec for being "fantastic" and a "very kind man" while he supported him through his trying times.</p>
      <p>He added: "Dec's been fantastic, he's a very kind man who's been supportive of me, and our friendship has been tested and it's come out through the other end and I'll be forever grateful for the love we have.</p>

      <p>"I thought the public had had enough, I didn't think I'd be allowed to do what I love anymore, but coming back and being back on-screen and the love and support shown is overwhelming… I can't thank people enough."</p>
      <p>Dec confirmed their bond has gotten stronger since it all began.</p>
      <p>"We're much stronger together now, but our priorities have changed and now our friendship definitely comes first," he gushed.</p>
