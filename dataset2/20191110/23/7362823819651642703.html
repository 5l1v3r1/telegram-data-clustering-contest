      <p>Data from a defunct neo-Nazi website leaked online last week, potentially revealing the personal information of hundreds of extremists, some of whom have been linked to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism">acts of terrorism</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The data, which comprised the contents of the former website “Iron March,” was posted by the user “anti-data” on archive.org.</p>
      <p>Contents of the leak made it possible to obtain match usernames with registered emails, IP addresses, forum posts and direct messages, according to the open-source journalism website <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/11/06/massive-white-supremacist-message-board-leak-how-to-access-and-interpret-the-data/">Bellingcat</a>, which first flagged the leak.</p>

      <p>“Iron March” was founded in 2011 by Russian nationalist Alexander “Slavros” Mukhitdinov. It has been used by an organizational tool by multiple extremist groups, including <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/deadly-shooting-ends-friendships-forged-in-neo-nazi-group">Atomwaffen Division (AWD)</a>, a U.S.-based group that has been tied to at least half a dozen murders and multiple acts of violence over the past few years.</p>
      <p>Chats from the leak suggested that the website attracted users from around the world who shared material and offered support to each other.</p>
