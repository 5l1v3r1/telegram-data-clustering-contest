      <h1>Edmonton parents going to Tokyo after toddler's button pushing wins them contest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:55:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Antoneshyn, Digital Journalist</a></address>
      <p>Like most kids, 20-month-old Anthony Tappenden likes to push his parents' buttons.</p>
      <p>But not just the ones having to do with patience. All buttons. On phones. On remotes.</p>
      <p>This one time, his parents, Lee and Amy, don't mind.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Lee received a call from Shaw informing him the couple had won an all-expenses paid trip to Tokyo.</p>
      <p>"I just really didn’t believe it at all. I asked him many times, 'Is this a scam here? Are you really from Shaw?" Lee recalled.</p>
      <p>"He laughed it off and said, 'It’s not a scam. I’m really from Shaw.'"</p>
      <p>After doing his own research, Lee discovered "it was, in fact, true."</p>
      <p>The couple had won a contest by ordering the animated sci-fi thriller <i>Alita: Battle Angel</i> through a Shaw promotion.  </p>
      <p>Except the couple had never seen the movie, nor did they remember ordering it.</p>
      <p>"I even checked my bill, and yeah, we ordered the movie. I put two and two together," Lee told CTV News Edmonton.</p>
      <p>"Anthony always plays with the remote. He pushes buttons constantly, and it was at a time I was at work and (Amy) was home with him."</p>
      <p>Upon checking his bill, Lee found <i>Alita: Battle Angel</i> had actually been ordered twice, on Aug. 17 and Aug. 28.</p>
      <p>"Because it was the feature film, he must have just clicked a bunch of times," Amy explained.</p>
      <p>Lee is sure: "He was definitely the one that did it."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.itravel2000.com/japan">The iTravel prize</a> is valued at $8,500, and includes seven nights in a four-star hotel in Tokyo, a day tour package, as well as flights there and back.</p>
      <p>"I’m not lying: Not even a month ago, we’re sitting together just chatting in bed and said, 'You know, when we retire, what kind of places would you want to go?'" Amy told CTV News Edmonton.</p>
      <p>"Both of us, top of our list is Japan. And sure enough, a month later we get a phone call. And instead of waiting until we’re 65, we can go."</p>
      <p>Despite his role, Anthony won't be going with his mom and dad. But the pair said they've since watched the film at the root of it all.</p>
      <p>"I ended up watching it last night just to see what won us the contest," Lee said.</p>
      <p>"It was actually pretty good."</p>
