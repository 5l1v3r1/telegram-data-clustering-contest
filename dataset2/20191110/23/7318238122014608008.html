      <h1>Hannover elects first German mayor of Turkish origin</h1>

      <p>The German city of Hannover became the first regional capital and the first city in the country to elect a mayor of Turkish origin on Sunday, in a powerful symbol for German citizens of Turkish immigration descent.</p>
      <p>Belit Onay, of Die Grünen, the German Green party, won 52.9 % of the vote against the CDU candidate Eckhard Scholz, who got to 47.1%.</p>
      <p>Hannover is the fourth large city in Germany after Freiburg, Darmstadt and Stuttgart in which a "Grüner", a politician of the Green Party, has become mayor.</p>
      <p>The former mayor, the Social Democrats' Stefan Schostok, resigned earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Onay, a lawyer by profession, has served as an MP in the Lower Saxony Parliament since 2013, and before that had been a city councillor since 2011.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old new mayor was born in Goslar, Lower Saxony, to Turkish parents who emigrated from Istanbul to Germany in the 1970s.</p>

      <p>Germany hosts almost 3 million people of Turkish origin. Many came after 1945 as "guest workers" and settled in the country.</p>
      <p>Germany's Turkish population is the second-largest Turkish population in the world, after Turkey itself.</p>
