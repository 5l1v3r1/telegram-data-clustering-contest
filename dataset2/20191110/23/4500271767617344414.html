      <p>Eid-i-Miladun Nabi — a celebration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) on 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal — was celebrated with religious zeal and fervour throughout Pakistan on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the government and semi-government buildings and offices were also decorated beautifully on the occasion.</p>
      <p>Processions were taken out in all major cities of the country. Participants rode on profusely decorated vehicles. Many were children who also wore Arabic dresses and rode on decorated horses and camels.</p>
