      <p>Miley Cyrus’s poor vocal cord journey just got a lot more intense. The singer, who was recently in the hospital for tonsillitis, recently left the hospital again after having surgery on her vocal cords. <a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-undergoes-vocal-cord-surgery/">According to </a><i><a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-undergoes-vocal-cord-surgery/">People</a></i>, while Cyrus was being treated for her tonsillitis, doctors uncovered another problem with her vocal cords that had gone untreated for years.</p>
      <p>As a result of the surgery, Cyrus will need to have a few weeks of silence to recover, putting her recent recording sessions on hold. Last month she posted a photo to Instagram of her working out writing, “On vocal rest not body.”</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Cyrus fans, the surgery went well and she is expected to get back to recording her new music as soon as she can. A source told <i>People</i> that she’s “doing great and will be back and better than ever early next year.”</p>
      <p>Cyrus’s boyfriend, Cody Simpson, has been keeping her company as she heals. He recently opened up about their whirlwind romance during an appearance on <i>The Kyle and Jackie O Show</i>.</p>
      <p>“We keep each other in a good place,” he said last month. “That’s what’s really healthy about it and I think that’s the first time I’ve had that in a relationship. We’re very, very much on the same page.”</p>
      <p>Simpson was by her side during her <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29410705/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-boyfriend-instagram-story/">earlier hospital stint</a>, surprising her with flowers and a song when he came to visit her.</p>
