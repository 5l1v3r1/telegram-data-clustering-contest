      <h1>Pakistan condemns restrictions in IOK on Eid Miladun Nabi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:25:59+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Islamabad condemned on Sunday New Delhi for imposing restrictions on congregations during Eid Miladun Nabi in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK), which has been under lockdown since August 5 when its autonomy was revoked.</p>
      <p>“Imposition of restrictions on celebrations and other congregations on the birthday of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) represents utter disrespect for the sentiments of Muslims of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement. “It is also a flagrant violation of their fundamental freedom of religion.”</p>
      <p>Pakistan urged the international community, the United Nations, and other human rights organisations to take notice of the brutal suppression of the religious rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people “in violation of international laws and conventions.”</p>
      <p>For more than fourteen weeks, over 8 million Kashmiris are under the inhuman lockdown by over 900,000 Indian occupation forces.</p>
      <p>“The Indian government should immediately restore internet and mobile phone services, release all prisoners including civil society members..allow the independent media and international human rights observers to visit the region..,” the communique read.</p>
      <p>It said that India could not suppress the aspirations of Kashmiris for exercising their right to self-determination as enshrined in the UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
