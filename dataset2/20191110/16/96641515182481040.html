      <h1>Watch a herd of MIT's Mini Cheetah robots frolic in the fall leaves</h1>
      <h2>Backflips, soccer and creepy dances are part of the fun.</h2>

      <p>MIT wants to show that its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/02/mit-mini-cheetah-backflip-robot/">Mini Cheetah robots</a> aren't just solitary creatures. The school's Biomimetics department has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6fMV1UPzkg&amp;feature=emb_title">posted</a> a video of nine of the bots frolicking in the fall leaves, showing just what these pet-sized quadrupeds can do. The remote-controlled machines can backflip out of leaf piles, kick a soccer ball and have friendly tussles... well, if a bodyslam can be considered friendly. There's even some eerie coordinated dancing, in case you want to know how robots will socialize once the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/20/boston-dynamics-robots-resist/">robopocalypse</a> is over.</p>
      <p>Really, this illustrates how the Mini Cheetah project is moving forward. Now that the bot is proven to work, MIT is building a fleet to lend out examples for research projects. Demos like this are a step toward improvements in robot locomotion and other scientific pursuits. Whatever creepiness you see here could lead to robots that are better-suited to hazardous work, search-and-rescue and other efforts that might just <i>save</i> human lives.</p>
