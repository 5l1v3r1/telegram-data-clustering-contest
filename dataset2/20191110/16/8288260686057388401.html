      <p>Two minutes silence was observed at 11am across the Midlands as the country's war dead were remembered in a number of parades and services.</p>
      <p>This November marks 100 years of  <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/remembrance">Remembrance</a>  services in the UK when in 1919, the nation paid tribute to the fallen.</p>
      <p>In Birmingham the parade was held in Colmore Row outside the Cathedral.</p>
      <p>Armistice Day is commemorated every year on November 11 to mark the declaration signed between the Allies of the First World War and Germany ,which took effect at 11am - the 'eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month' of 1918.</p>
      <p>In 1919, the First World War had ended, but for three years families were denied the chance to bury their loved ones as bodies had not been sent back to the UK since 1915. Instead the men were buried where they fell.</p>
      <p>Our photographers, Iain Findlay and Adam Fradgley, were in Birmingham city centre and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/stourbridge">Stourbridge</a> to capture two of the parades.</p>

      <p>The first <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Armistice Day</a> was born as the nation united in grief on November 11, 1919 and in Whitehall a Cenotaph was erected and thousands of people gathered to mourn.</p>
