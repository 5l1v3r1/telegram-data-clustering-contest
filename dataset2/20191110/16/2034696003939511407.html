        <b>The episode tackles themes of police brutality and discrimination via its 'Citadel of Ricks' concept</b>
      </p>
      <p>In season three episode seven of <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/rick-and-morty-season-4-release-date-plot-and-everything-we-know-so-far-2146711"><i>Rick and Morty</i></a>, known alternately as ‘The Ricklantis Mixup’ and ‘Tales From The Citadel’, the fractures in a divided and unbalanced society grate against one other unbearably. The upshot – a brutal mirroring of America’s woes – earned the show its highest-ever rated episode, with an average score of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5218332/">9.9/10</a> on<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/eprate"> IMDb</a>.</p>
      <p>‘The Ricklantis Mixup’ ignores our own Rick and Morty (from dimension C-137), instead heading to The Citadel of Ricks – which was torn apart by Rick C-137’s catastrophic attack in season three, episode one. Here, Mortys from innumerate dimensions play second-class citizens who are constantly under the boot of their corresponding Ricks.</p>

      <p>As well as the institutionalised discrimination and police brutality that this scenario entails, the 22-minute episode manages to pack in populist politics, adolescent directionlessness (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/6zg5u1/in_case_you_missed_it_the_mortys_in_the_newest/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=rickandmorty"><i>Stand By Me</i></a>) and dissatisfaction, crafting an improbably searing critique of real-world America, and reintroducing a formidable villain – <a href="http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Morty">Evil Morty</a> – to set-up season three’s endgame.</p>
      <p>It was a classic <i>Rick &amp; Morty </i>episode, containing a beautiful mix of the show’s strongpoints. Wackiness, parody, science-fiction, tragedy, humour – they were all here in spades. In addition to rating the episode an unprecedented 9.8/10, fans have also lavished praise on the writing and<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/6zicw0/give_this_man_a_fucking_emmy/?st=j7hofjk3&amp;sh=5bf5d72b"> voice acting</a> – because 98% of this episode was voiced by Justin Roiland, who played dozens of variations of just two characters.</p>
      <p>Kumail Nanjiani, star of <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-big-sick-film-review-2116885"><i>The Big Sick</i></a>, was among the most vocal proponents of the episode:</p>

      <p>The show’s treatment of police brutality and corruption struck a chord with thousands of viewers:</p>

      <p>Some noted that the show didn’t even need ‘our’ Rick and Morty – the ones from dimension C-137 – to succeed:</p>

      <p>And many seem to think it’s one of the best episodes of animated TV ever:</p>
