        <p><b>NYT’S PETER BAKER </b>in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and <b>MAGGIE HABERMAN: “In Seeking to Join Suit Over Subpoena Power, Mulvaney Goes Up Against the President”:</b> “Even in a White House of never-befores, this may be one of the more head-spinning: The president’s chief of staff is trying to join a lawsuit against the president.</p>
        <p><b>“Mick Mulvaney works only about 50 steps from the Oval Office </b>as he runs the White House staff but rather than simply obey President Trump’s order to not cooperate with House impeachment investigators, he sent his lawyers to court late Friday night asking a judge whether he should or not.</p>
        <p><b>“To obtain such a ruling, the lawyers asked to join a lawsuit </b>already filed by a former White House official — a lawsuit that names ‘the Honorable Donald J. Trump’ as a defendant along with congressional leaders. The lawyers tried to finesse that by saying in the body of their motion that the defendants they really wanted to sue were the congressional leaders, but their own motion still listed Mr. Trump at the top as a defendant because that is the suit they sought to join.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/us/politics/mulvaney-trump-impeachment-subpoenas.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage"><u>NYT</u></a></p>
        <p><b>WAPO: “Republicans attempt to move impeachment inquiry away from Trump,” </b>by Rachael Bade, Karoun Demirjian and Colby Itkowitz: “House Republicans on Saturday pressed ahead with their efforts to move the impeachment inquiry away from President Trump, calling on Democrats to add witnesses to the probe including former vice president Joe Biden’s son and the whistleblower whose initial complaint kicked off the investigation.</p>
        <p><b>“The GOP demands were met with immediate skepticism </b>from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who warned against ‘sham investigations’ of the Bidens and other issues in a clear signal that many of the witnesses were unlikely to be called.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-attempt-to-move-impeachment-inquiry-away-from-trump/2019/11/09/08cc3994-0256-11ea-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html"><u>WaPo</u></a></p>
        <p><b>MESSAGING ADVICE</b> from <b>REP. JIM HIMES (D-CONN.)</b> on <b>NBC’S “MEET THE PRESS”: </b>“Well I have two problems with quid pro quo. Number one, when you're trying to persuade the American people of something that is really pretty simple, which is that the President acted criminally and extorted in the way a mob boss would extort somebody, a vulnerable foreign country, it's probably best not to use Latin words to explain it.”</p>
        <p><b>… AND FROM SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY.),</b> also on MTP: “I think we've gotten lost in this whole idea of quid pro quo. And I think Senator Kennedy kind of hit the nail on the head. It's that, if you're not allowed to give aid to people who are corrupt, there's always contingencies on aid. Even, even President Obama withheld aid. You know, he was supposed to give lethal aid. Congress said, ‘Give them $300 million in lethal aid.’ And he sent them blankets. So presidents, since the beginning of time, have resisted Congress.</p>
        <p><b>“And there's been this sort of back-and-forth jockeying over what is sent</b>. But also, presidents have withheld aid before for corruption. So the thing is I think it's a mistake to say, ‘Oh, he withheld aid, until he got what he wanted.’ Well, if it's corruption, and he believes there to be corruption, he has every right to withhold aid. So I think it's a big mistake for anybody to argue quid pro quo, he didn't have quid pro quo. And I know that's what the administration's arguing. I wouldn't make that argument. I would make the argument that every politician in Washington, other than me, virtually, is trying to manipulate Ukraine to their purposes. Menendez tried it. Murphy tried it. Biden tried it. Trump's tried it. They're all doing it.”</p>

        <p><b>AP: “Former Trump Adviser John Bolton Has a Book Deal”: </b>“The hawkish Bolton departed in September because of numerous foreign policy disagreements with President Donald Trump. He reached a deal over the past few weeks with Simon &amp; Schuster, according to three publishing officials with knowledge of negotiations. The officials were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p><b>“Two of the officials said the deal was worth about $2 million. </b>Bolton was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include former FBI Director James Comey and the anonymous Trump administration official whose book, ‘A Warning,’ comes out Nov. 19.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/09/arts/ap-us-books-john-bolton.html?module=inline"><u>AP</u></a></p>

          <b>SUNDAY BEST …</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>JAKE TAPPER</b> spoke to <b>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR</b> (D-Minn.) on <b>CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: KLOBUCHAR </b>on <b>BLOOMBERG:</b> “I don't think [voters] say, oh, we need someone richer. I don't think that, Jake. I think you have to earn votes and not buy them. … I don’t think you just waltz in and say instead of well, ‘I’m good enough to be president,’ your argument is, the other people aren’t good enough. That is not how we’ve been conducting these debates.</p>
        <p><b>CHUCK TODD</b> spoke to <b>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OHIO)</b> on <b>NBC’S “MEET THE PRESS”</b>: <b>TODD:</b> “What do you make of this feeling in the Democratic party right now about nervousness in this field?”</p>
        <p><b>BROWN: </b>“Well, it’s genetic that Democrats wring their hands about presidential campaigns, I mean we, we always do. I, I think it’s a good field. I think we’re going to beat Trump. I think when people, when voters make the contrast with President Trump’s promises, especially his promises to workers in Lordstown, Ohio and all over the industrial Midwest, and contrast that with Trump’s betrayal of workers on minimum wage, and over time, and his court appointees and the National Labor Relations Board and all the way he’s, he betrays workers in the middle west and he betrays our allies in the Middle East. And I think that’s, that’s the contrast voters are going to make with whomever, with whomever our nominee is and we win in 2020 as a result. So I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have this hand wringing anguish that a number of my, a number of others might have.”</p>
        <p><b>CHRIS WALLACE</b> spoke to <b>REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY (D-N.Y.)</b> on <b>“FOX NEWS SUNDAY”</b>: <b>MALONEY</b> said the new Trump-Zelensky transcript is not “relevant to this investigation” <b><a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSunday/status/1193546063346589700"><i>The video clip</i></a></b></p>
        <p><b>A BIT OF DISSENTION … MARTHA RADDATZ</b> spoke to <b>REP. MAC THORNBERRY (R-TEXAS.) </b>on ABC’s “This Week”: <b>RADDATZ:</b> <b>RADDATZ:</b> “Congressman, you're again talking about process. The process. I asked you about substance. How do you fend against the substance?</p>
        <p><b>THORNBERRY</b>: “Well, as you know -- maybe you know, Martha -- I believe it's inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. Now that leads to a question if there's a political rival with a family member who is involved in questionable activity, what do you do? Just let them alone. But set that aside. I believe it was inappropriate. I do not believe it was impeachable.</p>
        <p><b>“And process -- you know, you all always want to say substance, </b>not process. There's a reason we let murderers and robbers and rapists go free when their due process rights have been violated. We believe the integrity of the system, the integrity of the constitution, the integrity of the processes under our legal system, is more important than the outcome of one particular case. So, I don't think you can sweep process under the rug, because it is part of an impeachment decision, which has a constitutional requirement: bribery, treason, high crimes and misdemeanors, but also a political element about whether it's good for the country to pursue it under these circumstances.”</p>

        <p><b>NYT, A1 … SYDNEY EMBER </b>and <b>JONATHAN MARTIN: “‘I’d Consider Anybody’: Democrats Like Their 2020 Candidates, and Yet …” </b>(print headline: “<b>Bloomberg Nudges Into a Field Chock Full of Not-So-Sure Bets”</b>): “Mr. Bloomberg has jolted the Democratic primary, drawing fire from the leading liberals in the field who said he was trying to buy the presidency while posing a direct threat to the centrist candidacy of Mr. Biden. But he has also exposed the jitters among establishment-aligned Democrats who fear that the leftward turn of the party is endangering their chances of building a winning coalition.</p>
        <p><b>“For weeks, senior Democratic officials and donors</b> have been musing about whether a new candidate could be lured in the race, a striking illustration of nervousness just three months before the Iowa caucuses. Some talked up Mr. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton, but others wondered if Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio might make a late entry to unite a party splintered along ideological lines.</p>
        <p><b>“And while some party leaders have muted their concerns in an effort</b> to be neutral, that restraint has started to give way to open expressions of alarm. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been repeating the same mantra — ‘Remember November’ — in private about focusing on winning the general election, and has told Democratic allies she was uneasy about a nominee running on Medicare for all.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/09/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-democrats.html"><u>NYT</u></a></p>
