      <h2>The six-year-old French boy who plunged 30m from the London gallery's viewing platform is making good progress as Jonty Bravery awaits trial for attempted murder</h2>

      <p>The six-year old seriously injured after allegedly being thrown from the viewing platform of the Tate Modern art gallery in London is now able to venture outside, his family have confirmed.</p>
      <p>The French youngster, who cannot be named because of his age, has also regained some movement in his legs as he continues to recover from the fall three months on.</p>
      <p>He plunged 98-feet from the art gallery’s 10th floor on to a fifth-floor roof in August.</p>
      <p>In a post on a GoFundMe page, which has raised more than £119,000 to support the boy's rehabilitation, his family said their "little knight" was making progress.</p>
      <p>They said: "We would like to share with you some good news of our little knight.</p>

      <p>"He is making lots of progresses. We can now bring him outside in a wheelchair to breath fresh air.</p>
      <p>"It's tiring for him but he really likes it, of course.</p>
      <p>"He's very smiling and he laughs a lot again. He begins to move his legs since a few days, just a tiny little bit but it is really wonderful to see...!"</p>

      <p>"And just since today, he manages to make real kisses.</p>
      <p>"It warms our hearts so much... Thank you all of you. We hope we will give you other good news as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Last month, the family revealed the six-year-old had been moved out of intensive care into a rehabilitation centre with an "armour of splints" keeping many of his limbs in place as he heals.</p>

      <p>At the time the family announced: "He is now in a rehabilitation centre.</p>
      <p>"He still has some metal in his body but instead of plasters he has got a full armour of splints: legs, feet, hands, arms, neck and torso.</p>
      <p>"It is impressive - he looks like a little knight, and we can take these splints off sometimes.</p>
      <p>"He also makes some little progresses - he moves his right hand more and more and arm on command (he catches us most of the time when we are nearby!) even if he feels sometimes a little bit sad when he doesn't manage to do what he tries."</p>
