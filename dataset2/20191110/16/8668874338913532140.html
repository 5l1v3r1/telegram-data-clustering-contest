      <h1>Bevan try snatches last-gasp victory for Wales over Ireland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:52:44+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Keira Bevan’s last-gasp try gave <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> a 15-13 victory at the UCD Bowl and denied <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> a maiden November Test victory.</p>
      <p>Adam Griggs’ side were on the cusp of a winning start to their international season when Ellen Murphy kicked a penalty with six minutes remaining to put here side 13-10 up.</p>
      <p>Ireland had created some daylight through tries from Linda Djougang and Enya Breen, before Wales responded with 10 unanswered points.</p>
      <p>The hosts still looked like they would hold on for just their second success of 2019, until replacement scrum-half Bevan went over to seal a narrow win for Wales.</p>
