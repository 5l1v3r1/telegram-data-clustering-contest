      <h1>Drunk Olivia Colman Deserves Her Own Oscar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:29:37+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Madeleine Aggeler</a></address>
      <p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/oscars-2019-olivia-colman-speech-91st-academy-awards.html">Olivia Colman won</a> the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in <i>The Favourite</i>. Her performance in the film is exceptional, and the award was well-deserved. However, there was one woman in the Dolby Theatre that night who did not receive an Oscar she so richly deserved for her own captivating performance. No, I’m not talking about Glenn Close, or Lady Gaga, or any of the other Best Actress nominees. I’m talking about Drunk Olivia Colman, who was “bladdered” and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/oscars-2019-olivia-colman-speech-91st-academy-awards.html">still gave a perfect acceptance speech</a>. During an appearance on <i>The Graham Norton Show</i> this week, <i>The Crown</i> actress joked that she actually can’t remember her speech because everyone was busy boozing behind the stage. “The great thing about the Oscars is there is a bar just behind [the stage] so everyone is there,” <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7664105/Olivia-Colman-remember-winning-Oscar-drunk.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailceleb">she explained</a>. “There are hundreds of seat fillers so almost everybody is in the bar getting bladdered!”</p>
      <p>That Colman was a little sauced during her speech doesn’t come as a huge surprise, given how irreverent it was. “This is genuinely quite stressful. This is hilarious,” she said upon accepting her award, teary-eyed and with a beaming smile, before going on to thank her co-stars, assuring the audience that “this is never going to happen again,” and making a farting noise with her mouth when she got a signal to wrap up. It was a funny, charming, and moving performance that absolutely deserves its own award for excellence. Because even though it’s what we all think we sound like after three beers, none of us are actually as good at drunkenly shouting at a roomful of people as <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/09/the-crown-season-3-olivia-colman-eyes-continuity-error.html">Olivia Colman is</a>.</p>
