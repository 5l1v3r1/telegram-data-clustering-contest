      <h1>Hyundai Sales Analysis For October 2019 – i20, i10, Venue, Creta In Top 5</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:00:35+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://gaadiwaadi.com/author/pranavsiddharth0303/" target="_blank">Team GaadiWaadi</a></address>
      <h3>In October 2019, Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) showed a definite improvement in its sales performance, with Santro, Verna and Elite i20 being the biggest gainers on MoM basis</h3>
      <p>The arrival of the festive season has finally helped many Indian carmakers breath a sigh of relief, with the demand for new cars finally picking up after months of slowdown. The increase in sales has been witnessed by most companies, including Hyundai Motor India Ltd, the country’s second-largest carmaker by volume and the biggest exporter.</p>
      <p>Among a host of cars that the Indian subsidiary of the South Korean carmaker sells in India, it’s the trio of Santro, Verna and Elite i20 that have shown biggest improvement in demand last month. Here’s our model-wise sales analysis –</p>
      <h4>Hyundai Creta Oct 2019 Sales:</h4>
      <p>The erstwhile top-seller in its segment, which has seen a dip in demand due to advent of Kia Seltos, sold 7,269 units in October 2019. This is a 9.5 per cent increase over 6,641 units sold in September 2019. However, the small SUV marked a de-growth of 37.9 per cent on the YoY basis.</p>

      <h4>Hyundai Elantra Oct 2019 Sales:</h4>
      <p>The D1-segment sedan in the carmaker’s lineup recently received a pretty comprehensive facelift, which brings in many new styling elements and a set of additional features. In spite of the update, the three-box model has failed to post a respectable sales figure during this year’s Diwali season.</p>
      <p>Last month, only 59 units of the Elantra were sold, which is a massive 37.2 per cent drop from 94 units sold in September 2019. The car even suffered on YoY basis as it marked a de-growth of 48.7 per cent.</p>
      <h4>Hyundai Elite i20 Oct 2019 Sales:</h4>
      <p>The Maruti Baleno rival from Hyundai Motor India Ltd put on a decent show last month with a total sale of 14,468 units, which is a 44.8 per cent improvement over 10,141 units sold in September 2019. It also marks a 10.5 per cent increment in sales on YoY basis. The Elite i20 will be replaced by the third-gen i20 next year, which is likely to help HMIL finally outclass the Baleno.</p>
