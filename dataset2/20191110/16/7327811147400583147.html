      <p>CHELSEA, Manhattan (WABC) -- It was a NYCHA no-no in Chelsea.</p>
      <p>There is evidence that tenants of a public housing apartment put their unit up for rent on Airbnb.</p>
      <p>The apartment is in the NYCHA complex that stretches from 25th to 28th Streets between 9th and 10th Avenues.</p>
      <p>A mother and daughter booked a unit for $90 a night. They wound up reporting the official tenant.</p>
      <p>Boston resident Rachel Valerio told The New York Times that the apartment was highly rated on Airbnb but it smelled like gas and there was a roach trap next to the bed.</p>
      <p>Now there is talk of city council hearings on the matter.</p>
      <p>Airbnb says it was unaware of the situation, and it supports a ban on rentals in affordable housing.</p>
      <p>NYCHA released a statement:<br/>"Illegal subletting of NYCHA apartments on Airbnb is prohibited by HUD regulations and by our lease agreements. We are investigating the matter."</p>
