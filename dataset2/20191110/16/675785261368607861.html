      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly</a> contestant <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michelle-visage">Michelle Visage</a> has got candid about her secret battle with a rare disease.</p>
      <p>The reality star, 51, opened up about the heartbreaking side effects caused by a rare disease she struggled with in secret for years due to her old breast implants.</p>
      <p>Following a breast augmentation at 21-years-old, Michelle was diagnosed with the rare Hashimoto's disease which can cause weight gain and depression.</p>
      <p>The auto immune disease, which attacks the thyroid gland, left the Drag Race judge with unexplainable symptoms so she was forced to carry out her own research.</p>

      <p>She said: "My skin was crackly dry and my hair was falling out in clumps. I was also having hardcore panic attacks.</p>
      <p>"My journey goes back to me getting breast implants at the age of 21. My body couldn't fight off the attacker because it was there 24 hours a day, seven days a week."</p>
      <p>The telly star battled the secret health problem for decades which led to her hair falling out in clumps and her suffering with crippling panic attacks.</p>

      <p>The Strictly star had the implants removed 30 years after getting them done and has since seen improvements.</p>
      <p>She said: "Since having them removed, the thyroid nodule is going down, which is amazing."</p>
      <p>The star also revealed how she discovered over 50,000 women with similar issues from their breast implants on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>The New Jersey native faced the gruelling 20 year battle with the disease alone, and even feared it was cancer at one point.</p>
      <p>She recently told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/">OK!</a> magazine: "It's not cancer, thank God.</p>
      <p>"I got the report that it was benign the day I was coming to England for Strictly."</p>
