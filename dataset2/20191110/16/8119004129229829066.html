        <b>River transport services will resume on all routes on Monday as the impact of Cyclone Bulbul is fading.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority announced the decision on Sunday, hours after the Met Office downgraded the cyclone.</p>
      <p>Authorities suspended all river transports on Friday evening after the cyclone loomed on the Bangladesh coast.</p>
      <p>The storm hit Bangladesh coasts on Saturday midnight in a weakened form and became a land depression on Sunday, but rains with gusts continued in many parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Maritime ports had also been shut and inland water transport services suspended.</p>
      <p>The maritime ports opened on Sunday but cautionary signal No. 2 remained at the inland ports.</p>
      <p>Vessels longer than 65 feet are allowed to be operated under the signal, but the authorities appear more cautious to avoid mishaps.</p>
      <p>BIWTA Joint Director AKM Arif Uddin told bdnews24.com launch services would resume at 6am on Monday.</p>
