      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle camp is getting ready to welcome a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-2019-line-20835125">new batch of celebrities</a> .</p>
      <p>And the on-set clinic prepares for all the illnesses, injuries and accidents.</p>
      <p>The resident I'm A Celeb first aider Bob McCarron spoke about the numerous insect bites, stitches and bug removals he has had to endure over the years.</p>
      <p>The Australian medical expert works seven days a week for seven weeks straight for each series of the hit ITV show and is constantly busy due to the hot weather, snakes and thousands of poisonous critters.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/">The Sun</a> : "We treat an average of 30 cases a day in clinic. There are pretty much snake sightings every day."</p>
      <p>In one series, medic bob and the team had to deal with a crew member who went into anaphylactic shock from a tick bite and two who contracted tick fever.</p>
      <p>On that same series, more than 100 ticks were removed, while 22 carpet pythons, 12 green tree snakes and 11 brown tree snakes had to be relocated.</p>
      <p>There were also 14 cases of tonsillitis, 11 of the flu, 20 colds, 30 insect bites and two pregnancy announcements, reports the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Not forgetting the 30 rashes, numerous cuts, grazes, bumps and stitches.</p>

      <p>Famously, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fatima-whitbread">Fatima Whitbread</a> had a deadly near miss when a tree branch almost fell on her as a cockroach was being removed from her nostril.</p>
      <p>Trials Producer Kevin O'Brien recalled the incident: "The no.1 killer in the Aussie rainforest is falling branches.</p>
      <p>"We were standing in this tiny clearing with medic Bob poking around up Fatima's nose when we heard this  almighty crack.</p>
      <p>"This massive branch slams down just inches from where we are standing."</p>

      <p>A lot of the Bushtucker Trials leave celebrity's with small, unwanted souvenirs.</p>
      <p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/matthew-wright">Matthew Wright</a> had an insect stuck in his ear but luckily medic Bob was on hand to remove it with tweezers.</p>
      <p>No one can forget dramatic Gillian McKeith from 2010 after she fainted from a burial challenge involving rats.</p>
      <p>And the queen of Essex GC insisted that she suffered from post-traumatic stress from her experience in the jungle.</p>

      <p>In 2014, producers revealed a plague of ticks had infested the jungle camp, and the situation was so bad that one crew member had to be sent home.</p>
      <p>After leaving the I'm A Celebrity jungle in 2018 as runner-up, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/emily-atack">Emily Atack</a> was pictured with hundreds of agonising insect bites and painful swellings on her legs.</p>
      <p>During the same series, EastEnders star Rita Simons woke up covered in sore looking bites as did The Chase star Anne Hegerty who was seen with angry red blotches on her skin.</p>
