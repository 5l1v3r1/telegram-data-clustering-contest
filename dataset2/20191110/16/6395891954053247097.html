      <p><b>TEWKSBURY, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A Massachusetts spa owner is facing sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The Lowell Sun reports 34-year-old Xuedan Ou, of Tewksbury, was arrested Thursday following a nine-month investigation into sex trafficking and prostitution at the TCM Therapy Center.</p>
      <p>Assistant District Attorney Greg Galizio said during Ou's arraignment in Lowell District Court on Friday that authorities found advertisements on Craig's List suggesting prostitution was happening at the spa.</p>
      <p>Police say they also observed men leaving the spa who later admitted to receiving sexual acts inside.</p>
      <p>Ou's attorney maintained there's no evidence of any sexual acts being committed at the spa.</p>
      <p>She faces charges including trafficking a person for sexual servitude, keeping a house of prostitution and deriving support from prostitution.</p>
      <p>A judge set Ou's bail at $20,000. She's due back in court Dec. 2.</p>
