      <p><b>CHICAGO (AP)</b> - Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford has been ruled out for their game at Chicago because of hip and back issues, stopping his streak of 136 consecutive starts.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Stafford had been listed as questionable. It's the first time he has missed a regular-season game since the 2010 season.</p>
      <p>Jeff Driskel is stepping in for Stafford. Driskel is making his sixth career start.</p>
      <p>Stafford is working on another terrific year for Detroit, throwing for 2,499 yards and 19 touchdowns in the first half of the season.</p>
      <p>The Bears (3-5) had been a 2½-point favorite over the Lions (3-4-1), but Chicago was favored by 6½ points Sunday morning after the Stafford news broke.</p>
