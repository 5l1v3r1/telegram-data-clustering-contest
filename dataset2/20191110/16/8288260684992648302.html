      <p>This is the moment a brave shop keeper tackles a would-be thief who tried to steal vodka from his off-licence.</p>
      <p>Hero Rakesh Bhardwaj had popped out the back of his shop Jazz’s Off-Licence on <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/panic-no-teacher-emergency-stop-17215651">Wellington Road, Perry Barr</a> , when a man burst in, leapt over the counter and grabbed a bottle of Absolut.</p>
      <p>Mr Bhardwaj, 57, ran to the aid of his colleague and managed to wrestle the bottle off the man and after some coaxing, marched him of the shop without injury.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile one of Mr Bhardwaj’s friends managed to keep the thief’s accomplice from entering the shop and potentially escalating the situation.</p>
      <p>Mr Bhardwaj said he was no hero but instinctively protecting his co-worker 59-year-old Jaswinder Kaur and his livelihood.</p>
      <p>The father- of-two said: “I feel terrible because you come to work not to be abused and not to have violence. You do not expect to handle something like this.</p>

      <p>“There’s a lack of policing. Hurry up Boris Johnson, 20,000 police officers, where are they? There’s <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/almost-one-five-shops-closed-17213568">hardly any police anywhere</a> .</p>
      <p>The drama unfolded just as he headed into the backroom after 9pm on Monday, November 4.</p>
      <p>The proud shopkeeper, who keeps his business spotless, said: “I saw somebody in dark clothing dive over the counter and thought ‘what the hell’.</p>
      <p>“The guy must’ve thought Jaswinder was on her own and suddenly I appear. He was holding a bottle of Absolute and she was holding that as well.</p>
      <p>“I grabbed him too and said ‘let go of the bottle and I will let you go’ because <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/revealed-shocking-number-birmingham-children-17227909">I didn’t want a confrontation.</a> ”</p>

      <p>Mr Bhardwaj’s two friends emerged from the backroom and came to his aid. Meanwhile, the wanna-be thief’s friend saw what was happening to him inside the shop and tried to enter but was kept out.</p>
      <p>“During the scuffle, his stocky mate with a red eye tried to enter and put his hood up. Luckily my friend kept the other guy outside because if he had come inside, we would have had a problem.</p>
      <p>“Jaswinder was on the phone to the police.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/property/house-benefits-street-up-sale-17205872">West Midlands Police</a> said: “Officers were called to reports of an attempted theft at Jazz’s Off Licence, Wellington Road, Handsworth at just after 9pm on Monday 4 November.</p>
      <p>“Police enquiries are ongoing.”</p>
