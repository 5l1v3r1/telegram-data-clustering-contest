      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Aston Villa reaction | The claret and blue boss didn't hold back when he was interviewed about his side's display in the defeat at Molineux</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:58:51+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Raging Dean Smith boss let rip at his awe-struck Aston Villa players during half-time at Wolves, blasting "That’s as bad a first 45 minutes I’ve had since Wigan away last year."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> were well-beaten by their West Midlands rivals at Molineux and were fortunate to go in at the break just 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>Speaking afterwards, Smith spoke to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/">BirminghamLive</a> about his team's dour display, and here's part of the transcript from the press room.</p>
      <h4>What annoyed you most about today, Dean?</h4>
      <p>"The first 45 minutes," he said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>You didn’t move an inch in the first 45 minutes...</h4>
      <p>"A bit like some of my players as well today in the first 45 minutes," he added.</p>
      <p>"That’s as bad a first 45 minutes I’ve had since Wigan away last year. Very poor, didn’t start.</p>
      <p>"It appeared the game was bigger for them than it was for us, we didn’t win any balls, duels, didn’t pass it well. The best thing I got out of the first half was it was only 1-0 at half-time.”</p>

      <h4>What did you tell them at half-time?</h4>
      <p>"It’s something probably not for you to print!" he said.</p>
      <p>"Listen, we’ve got to go and compete, it doesn’t matter what game you’re playing.</p>
      <p>"People aren't just going to let you pass the ball and I thought they put us under pressure and we didn't cope with the pressure they put us under today in the first 45 minutes. You can't give anyone a 45-minute head start, especially in the Premier League."</p>
      <p>Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez scored for Wolves, with Trezeguet replying a late consolation for the hosts.</p>
