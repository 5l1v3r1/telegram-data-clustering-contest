      <h2>Former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was trying to take the pressure off the Citizens... but Jose Mourinho was having none of it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:31:55+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho silenced Vincent Kompany with a typically blunt comment ahead of Liverpool's Premier League title crunch clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City.</a></p>
      <p>Former City skipper Kompany was trying to say that the title won't be won or lost at Anfield this Sunday, despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> potentially going nine points clear of the champions.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho disagreed, and went a step further by suggesting he personally had a hand in some of Manchester City's previous success - in 2014 when his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> side beat Liverpool at Anfield, opening the door for the Citizens to win the title.</p>
      <p>Liverpool extended their lead over their rivals with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-3-1-man-city-20854920">a comfortable 3-1 win over their rivals.</a></p>
      <p>On Sky Sports, Kompany said: "In this case, if you look at the last decade or so, there have been numerous times where Liverpool were top of the league and there were numerous times where City were behind as well..."</p>

      <p>Mourinho interrupted: "But City was the best team!</p>
      <p>"When I gave you the title, you never told me thank you. When I gave you the title by winning here and you didn't even call me to say thank you, you were the best team.</p>

      <p>"They were not the best, they were there, they were almost there, but you were the best team, in this moment I don't think there is that difference in power.</p>
      <p>"Even in terms of statures, if statures play something. You are the champions of England but they are the champions of Europe.</p>

      <p>"They know how to win, they know how to cope with the pressure, so for me, the game today is very, very important.</p>
      <p>"Because if the distances are three points or six points, it is still very open, but if the difference is nine points, goodbye."</p>
