      <p>Police fired tear gas to break up rallies as black-clad activists blocked roads and trashed shopping malls across <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/hong-kong.html">Hong Kong</a> on the 24th straight weekend of anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy demonstrators vandalised a train station on Sunday in the central new town of Sha Tin in the New Territories region and smashed up a restaurant perceived as being pro-Beijing, overturning tables and smashing glass panels, two weeks before district council elections in the Chinese-ruled city.</p>
      <p>Violence also spilled out onto the streets of Tuen Mun outside the "V city" mall with running battles between riot police and protesters.</p>

      <p>The clashes came amid <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/anger-hong-kong-student-death-thousands-hold-vigils-191108134205877.html">rising anger</a> over a 22-year-old student activist's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/hong-kong-student-fell-weekend-protests-dies-report-191108024548301.html">death</a> and a day after the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/hong-kong-charges-pro-democracy-lawmakers-student-mourned-191109161404340.html">arrests</a> of pro-democracy city legislators.</p>
      <p>Police in green fatigues with riot helmets and shields fired tear gas to clear streets in Tsuen Wan in the northwest after chasing protesters in the district's Citywalk shopping mall. </p>
      <p>In Sha Tin in the northeast, authorities closed a subway station after protesters broke windows and damaged a ticket machine. Reporters saw police arrest three men at a residential complex elsewhere in Sha Tin but the reason was not clear.</p>
      <p>In Tuen Mun in the northwest, about three dozen people dressed in black, the symbolic colour of the protests, stormed through a shopping mall.</p>
      <p>Shopping districts across the harbour on the main island were quiet, however.</p>
      <p>"Radical protesters have been gathering in multiple locations across the territories," police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"They have been loitering in several malls and vandalising shops and facilities therein, neglecting the safety of members of the public."</p>
      <p>Al Jazeera's Sarah Clarke, reporting from central Hong Kong, said six districts were targeted.</p>
      <p>"We had a number of shopping centres damaged, MTRs [mass transit railways] were damaged and some barricades were set on fire by the protesters," she said. "The police did make some arrests."</p>

      <h3>'Shortfall in policing'</h3>
      <p>Hong Kong is in the sixth month of anti-government protests that began in June over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and other grievances.</p>
      <p>Although officials formally withdrew the bill, public anger has continued with activists demanding the resignation of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, police announced the arrest of six legislators on charges of obstructing the local assembly during a raucous May 11 meeting over the extradition bill. All were freed on bail.</p>
      <p>A seventh legislator received a summons but failed to turn up at the police station, a police spokesman said. All seven are to appear in court on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, protesters mourned Friday's death of a university student, Chow Tsz-Lok, who fell from a parking garage when police fired tear gas at protesters.</p>
      <p>"A couple hundred" gathered at one of the vigils in central Hong Kong, Clarke reported.</p>
      <p>During the five months of anti-government protests, deaths of certain protesters that were ruled suicide have fuelled the conspiracy theories of possible foul play by the police.</p>
      <p>Security officials have repeatedly denied using excessive force and refuted any allegations of wrongdoing in relation to Chow's death.</p>
      <p>Protesters have demanded an independent inquiry into police tactics, something Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has refused.</p>
      <p>In an embarrassing verdict on Sunday, a five-member international Independent Expert Panel said an analysis of the Hong Kong police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, indicated a shortfall in its powers and "independent investigative capability" to look into policing during the protests.</p>
      <p>A general strike is planned for Monday with protesters calling on people to block public transport.</p>
