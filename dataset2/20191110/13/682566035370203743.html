      <p>Cape Town - <b>Tabraiz Shamsi</b> led a spectacular bowling performance with three wickets as the <b>Paarl Rocks</b> began <b>Mzansi Super League (MSL) 2.0</b> by destroying the <b>Cape Town Blitz</b> at Boland Park on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The hosts won by 86 runs after dismissing the visitors for 84 - the lowest ever score since the inception of the competition last year.</p>
      <p>The Blitz had been trying to hunt down a strong 170 for nine, which was built around 38s by Henry Davids and Faf du Plessis.</p>
      <p>But they struggled in their chase as the 2019 edition of the tournament took its bow in Paarl.</p>
      <p>Hardus Viljoen (2/9) and Bjorn Fortuin (2/13) rocked the Blitz’ top order, before Shamsi made key lower-order inroads to send the away side packing in 15.4 overs, a score that beat the previous low mark of 92 made by the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants against Jozi Stars last year.</p>
      <p>It completed an impressive opening game all-round for the home side against a visiting team, who themselves started the competition with a bang on Friday by overcoming defending champions, the Jozi Stars, in the opening game in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>But there was no repeat this time as they completely fell apart with the bat against a ruthless Paarl outfit, led from the front by Du Plessis.</p>
      <p>The national captain won the toss and opted to bat first against their Cape rivals, with Cameron Delport (19) and Henry Davids getting their side off to a flier.</p>
      <p>The pair added 41 for the opening wicket in just 4.3 overs, before Du Plessis joined in to nearly double the score by the ninth.</p>
      <p>Davids then fell for 38 off 26 balls, with the skipper scoring the same amount of runs in just 20 balls to both end as joint top-scorers - the Rocks reaching 107 for two just over halfway.</p>
      <p>But George Linde (3/23) and Anrich Nortje (3/31) hauled the Blitz back from there as Paarl’s thin middle-order, which was hit by news of JP Duminy being ruled out of the competition due to injury in the build-up to the game, folded.</p>
      <p>However, the 171-target proved too much for their neighbours from Cape Town, especially after their two big-hitters, Quinton de Kock (14) and Janneman Malan (12), were sent packing in the first 4.3 overs by Viljoen, who conceded only nine in his two overs.</p>
      <p>Fortuin was even more miserly in dismissing Moeen Ali (13) and Aviwe Mgijima (2) – the Blitz slipping to 48 for five in eight overs by the time the latter was dismissed.</p>
      <p>Linde ended up top-scoring with 15, but he was amongst the victims of Shamsi as Paarl coasted to an impressive win.</p>
