      <h1>Jose Mourinho Claims Liverpool Will Go On To Win Premier League Title If They Beat Man City</h1>

        <b>Jose Mourinho has said that Liverpool will go onto win the Premier League title if they record a victory over Manchester City on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two best teams in English and, arguably, European football come face to face at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. Liverpool are currently six points clear of City at the top of the Premier League table and form suggests Jurgen Klopp’s team have the advantage heading into the fixture.</p>
      <p>Man City are without key players Ederson and Aymeric Laporte, while Rodri faces a late fitness test. Historically, they have struggled at Anfield and last won at the venue back in 2003 – long before the club was changed beyond all recognition by Abu Dhabi’s billions.</p>

      <p>Liverpool, meanwhile, have only lost one game in their last 50 league fixtures – a 2-1 defeat to Man City back in January. They are unbeaten at Anfield in 45 matches.</p>
      <p>Last season, Pep Guardiola’s side pipped Liverpool to the title, finishing one point ahead of them. To reverse that, Mourinho has stated that Klopp’s team must win on Sunday afternoon – even if there are still two-thirds of Premier League season to play.</p>
      <p>“I think Jurgen cannot say it, but I can,” Mourinho said on Sky Sports’ coverage.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think nine points is for a very good team, I think nine points is a difference you just have to control. So, I would say that if Liverpool win the game today, I think they will win the league.”</blockquote>

      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/ccunningham/jose-mourinho-sky/">Mourinho</a> went on to say that a draw would not be a good result for Liverpool, as Manchester City are capable of going on “very strong runs of consecutive victories” and that a “slip for Liverpool will always happen.”</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager said a draw would be a favourable result for the visitors and a bad result for Liverpool, as Klopp’s team would lose momentum.</p>
