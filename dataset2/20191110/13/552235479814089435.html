      <p>A Scots <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fan-breaks-golden-rule-19902747">tattoo artist</a> has been swamped with requests for ‘tribute ink’ in the run up to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-leads-tributes-scotland-20852940">Remembrance Day</a> .</p>
      <p>Talented William Hughes has inked dozens of tattoos to fallen comrades and colourful military themes in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>William is part of a real life Band of Brothers at one of Scotland’s first veteran-owned tattoo shops which celebrates the body art of war.</p>
      <p>He recently launched a new studio with hero former soldiers Terry Lowe and Andy McGuire who once risked life and limb fighting the Taliban together in the killing fields of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>William, 33, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> , who has been tattooing for 16 years, said: “It is a real honour to do these kind of tattoos and something that I really enjoy.</p>
      <p>"My relatives served in the military and a lot of people I know are either in the forces or are veterans.</p>
      <p>“My grandads were in the famous Desert Rats and the first regiment of the SAS. Going even further back, one of my great grandfathers was the regimental sergeant major of the Black Watch.</p>

      <p>“It’s great to be able to give someone a tribute to a comrade or a reminder of their service. I feel really lucky to be able to do this job and to see people leave happy with a lifelong memento.”</p>
      <p>Dad of four William’s studio - the Primrose Path Tattoo Society, located in the Hidden Lane in Glasgow’s Finnieston - has become a haven for military ink enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>Pride of place in their new studio is the Army stable belt and Tam o’ Shanter headdress of one of Terry and Andy’s Royal Regiment of Scotland comrades.</p>

      <p>He added: “We wanted the studio to be more than just a tattoo shop. It is about being part of a community and a place where people can hang out.</p>
      <p>"Military tattoos have a long history so it’s good to be part of that tradition.</p>
      <p>“We are thinking about having a special event offering special £11 poppy tattoos for Remembrance - and to raise cash for charity."</p>
      <p>Military tattoos have a long and colourful history. The idea of tattooing is believed to have entered British popular culture because of the Royal Navy, who discovered the art on their worldwide travels.</p>
      <p>In 2014, the British Army lifted their ban on visible tattoos.</p>

      <p>William’s tattoo shop buddy dad-of-three Terry served in the Royal Highland Fusiliers alongside Andy. They completed tours of duty together in Afghanistan and even served in the same platoon.</p>
      <p>Terry, 40, from Glasgow, said: “It’s great to be back with Andy again. We called the place The Primrose Path Tattoo Society.</p>
      <p>"It’s an old English term for the path of indulgence with disastrous consequences also known as the left hand path of Lucifer.”</p>
