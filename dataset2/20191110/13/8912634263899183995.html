He's hoping to block attempts by his chief rival, Benny Gantz, to form Israel's next government.<br/>The Cabinet voted Sunday for Bennett to become defense minister until a permanent government takes hold.<br/>Gantz is in the process of trying to cobble together a majority coalition after inconclusive elections in September. Netanyahu had the first try at forming a government, but failed.<br/>Bennett, who leads the New Right party, has demanded tougher military action against militants in Gaza.</p>
