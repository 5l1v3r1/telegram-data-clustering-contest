      <p><b>VATICAN CITYÂ (AP)</b> - Pope Francis is urging Bolivians, including its politicians, to calmly await the outcome of a disputed election review.</p>
      <p>Francis on Sunday told pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Square that he was entrusting to their prayers "the situation of beloved Bolivia," noting that it borders his homeland, Argentina.</p>
      <p>Dissension in police ranks in Bolivia is growing, posing a new threat to President Evo Morales, who seeks to curb nationwide arrest after the Oct. 20 election, in which he claimed victory.</p>
      <p>Morales' opponents say the results were manipulated.</p>
      <p>Francis invited all Bolivians, "in particular political and social players, to await with a constructive spirit, and without any previous condition, in a climate of peace and serenity" the results of the election review.</p>
