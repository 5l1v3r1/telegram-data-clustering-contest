      <h1>Walking cane once owned by Michael Collins to go under the hammer</h1>

      <p>A walking cane always carried by one of Ireland’s most revered political heroes is to go under the hammer later this month.</p>
      <p>The 98-year-old walking cane was once owned by Michael Collins and was later given as a gift to one of his drivers in the early 1920s.</p>
      <p>The 92cm rosewood and silver mounted cane is being sold with a letter of provenance from the vendor at De Vere’s Irish Auction Auctioneers and Valuers in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The walking cane forms part of the collection of John Cormack. John (Jack) Cormack, who was born in Lucan, Dublin on June 24, 1894 was a driver for Michael Collins.</p>
      <p>Cormack was shot in the leg and hand at the Red Cow in Dublin circa 1921 but a De Vere’s spokesperson explained that the, “exact date is unknown”.</p>

      <p>Collins gave Cormack the stick and it has remained in the family since.</p>
      <p>Jack Cormack’s granddaughter Sinéad inherited by descent.</p>
      <p>“We have estimated [the cane] at being worth from €2,000 to €4,000. There has been significant interest in the piece which does have historical value,” added the Auction House spokesperson.</p>
      <p>In 1921, Collins was sent to London to negotiate a Treaty with the British.</p>

      <p>A few months later in 1922, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was passed and as the country split into those who supported the Treaty and those who did not, Collins became Commander-in-Chief of the Free State Army.</p>
      <p>On August 22, 1922, Collins was shot and killed in an ambush by Anti-Treaty forces at Béal na mBláth, Co Cork. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.</p>
      <p>In 1996, the Neil Jordan directed Hollywood film, Michael Collins, starring born Liam Neeson.</p>
      <p>The auction takes place on November 26 at 6pm on Kildare St, Dublin.</p>
