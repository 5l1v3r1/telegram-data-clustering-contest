      <p>LA PAZ, Nov 10 — Bolivian President Evo Morales called fresh elections Sunday as the Organization for American States said the previous poll — which the opposition had claimed was fraudulent — must be re-run.</p>
      <p>Three people have died and hundreds injured in often violent protests since Morales claimed a fourth consecutive term in elections that the opposition charged were rigged.</p>
      <p>Morales, speaking in a TV address, said he would “call for new national elections, which, by voting, allow the Bolivian people to democratically elect new authorities.”</p>
      <p>Shortly before his announcement, the Organization for American States (OAS) recommended fresh elections.</p>
      <p>“The first round of the elections held last October 20 must be annulled and the electoral process must begin again,” it said.</p>
      <p>The OAS added that the first round of the elections should take place as soon as a new electoral commission is in place. </p>
      <p>Morales’ announcement comes a day after police in three cities joined anti-government protests and his call yesterday for urgent, open-ended dialogue with the opposition was rejected. — AFP</p>
