      <p>He said that while 2.73 lakh families were affected in the storm, 1.78 lakh people were moved to relief camps set up in nine places of the state.</p>
      <p>'Bulbul' claimed the lives of five persons in separate incidents in North Parganas alone, an official said.</p>
      <p>According to a senior police officer, a septuagenarian woman, Suchitra Mandal, died at Purba Makala village in Basirhat area of the district when a tree fell on her.</p>
      <p>Several trees were also uprooted at Gokhna village, one of which claimed the life of Reba Biswas (47).</p>

      <p>"Later I would take a meeting at Kakdwip with administration to review relief and rehabilitation measures of the cyclone-affected people. I am also planning to visit the cyclone-affected areas of Basirhat of North 24-Parganas on 13 November, 2019," Banerjee tweeted on Sunday.</p>
      <p>State power minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay said, measures were being taken to restore power supply in areas, where electric cables have been torn apart due to the cyclone.</p>
