      <p>The dad of a murdered girl scout found out he had lost his daughter when he overheard it on a police radio.</p>
      <p>Officers had collected Peter Chesney, 39, from a pub where he had been celebrating his birthday, unaware 17-year-old Jodie had been stabbed in a park in Romford, east London, on March 1.</p>
      <p>He discovered the tragic news as he was being rushed to hospital in a police van and he heard an officer’s radio crackle to life and an operator say: “Jodie’s gone.”</p>
      <p>He said he sank to his knees on hearing his daughter had died.</p>
      <p>Peter told the Daily Mail: “At first I didn’t take in the enormity of it. The human body protects you to a degree in those situations from some of the grief you later feel.</p>

      <p>“That’s how I heard my daughter had died — on a police radio. I’m not blaming them, though.</p>
      <p>“They were just doing their job and I happened to hear it.</p>
      <p>“I sank on my knees in grief, crying. We were all crying. What haunts me is the pain she was in. She screamed for a solid minute. I miss her so much.”</p>
      <p>Jodie, who lived in Dagenham, east London, was also a self-taught pianist and just three weeks from completing her gold Duke of Edinburgh award.</p>
      <p>Peter says she may now be awarded posthumously.</p>

      <p>On Thursday Scenson Ong-a-Kwie, a drug dealer, and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of Jodie's murder at the Old Bailey.</p>
      <p>Jurors were told that Ong-a-Kwie, who was the knife man, stabbed Jodie in the back mistakenly thinking she was a rival gang member.</p>
      <p>The court heard  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8636536/jodie-chesney-murder-suspect-svenson-ong-a-kwie-court/">Ong-a-Kwie</a> wanted to knife a rival gang member for stabbing him weeks earlier but in the darkness he had lunged at Jodie in a case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>Peter also revealed his marriage to Jodie's stepmother Joanne collapsed three months ago as they struggled to cope with their sad loss.</p>

      <p>The couple got married in 2012 and Joanne doted on Jodie and her older sister 20-year-old Lucy.</p>
      <p>Lucy wrote in a victim impact statement that since the killing she has been “dreading my life rather than looking forward to it”.</p>
      <p>The news comes as Eddie Coyle, the boyfriend of Jodie, has been revealed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following her murder.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was with Jodie when she was stabbed and he held her in his arms as she was dying.</p>

      <p>Eddie’s mum Cylla said: “His pain is raw. It has devastated our lives.</p>
      <p>“He’s now got PTSD and anxiety and doesn’t go out much. This has torn us apart.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t want to see counsellors and he doesn’t want to speak to anyone, but he does speak to me about it. He’s not working and he’s not at college. He was meant to be doing his A-levels.</p>
      <p>“I’m really lucky in the sense that he’s not a victim, in the sense that he wants to move forward. But obviously he’s up against the anxiety and PTSD. It has put our lives on hold."</p>
      <p>Jodie's killers will be sentenced on November 18.</p>
