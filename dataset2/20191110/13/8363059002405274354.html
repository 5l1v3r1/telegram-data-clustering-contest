      <h1>This Parody of Blade Runner Is Prepared to Hunt Down 2019's Real Machine Menace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T13:00:25+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Muncy</a></address>
      <p>Okay, yeah, the replicants aren’t bad, that’s the whole point of <i><a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/l-a-museum-opens-new-exhibit-of-dystopian-vehicles-fro-1834478920">Blade Runner</a></i>. But, throwing that little subtextual wrinkle out the window, let’s consider the fact that <i><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/03/meet-the-new-replicant-hunter-in-titan-comics-blade-runner-2019/">Blade Runner</a></i> is now set in the present. It’s November 2019, the same timeframe as the original film. It’s happening, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/heads-up-replicants-may-already-be-among-us/">out there</a>, in the streets. And if it’s happening, maybe it’s happening like this.</p>
      <p>In a very of-the-moment parody, the creators at YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwogNWtbij60iRbWySSAnlg">Back to the 2015 Future</a> decide to take <i>Blade Runner</i>’s setup into the present, replacing replicants with the modern world’s most pernicious technological menace: Amazon. Which is to say: there are a lot of people talking to Alexas in this video.</p>

      <p>Can an Alexa feel? Can it experience emotion? Can an Alexa pass the Voight Kampff test? Those are the sort of questions this version of <i>Blade Runner</i> is interested in, and it quickly devolves into various forms of slapstick as Deckard and his compatriots try to interrogate and interact with a group of rogue Alexa units. With moustaches. They’re great at disguises.</p>
      <p>It’s a funny, entertaining little thing, just precise enough to be a delight when it falls apart. Is Deckard an Alexa? I mean. Probably not.</p>
