      <h1>Remembrance Sunday: Why Kate was stood next to the Queen and Meghan wasn't</h1>
      <h2>The Duchess of Sussex was moved away from The Queen because the Royals are grouped together in order of precedence, rather than favoritism</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T13:14:28+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">Brendan McFadden</a></address>
      <p>The Queen was only joined by Kate Middleton and Camilla Parker-Bowles on a balcony during a Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London today - reigniting rumours of a rift between the duchesses.</p>
      <p>Meghan was seen on a separate balcony alongside the Countess of Wessex and Sir Timothy Laurence.</p>
      <p>But fears of negative tensions between the pair are unfounded because The Duchess of Sussex was actually moved away from The Queen because the Royals are grouped together in order of precedence, rather than favoritism.</p>

      <p>Heirs to the throne are typically seated with Her Majesty, as was seen at Saturday night's Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance service at the Royal Albert Hall, where she was flanked on her right by future king William and wife Kate.</p>
      <p>The balconies of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office building are also smaller than at Buckingham Palace when all of the royal family can squeeze onto one for events like Trooping of the Colour, <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111080350/meghan-markle-separate-balcony-kate-middleton-remembrance-sunday/">Hello! reports.</a></p>

      <p>During the two minutes silence at 11am Her Majesty, who was dressed all in black, was seen with a tear on her cheek as she stood on a balcony with Kate Middleton and Camilla Parker-Bowles.</p>
      <p>Princes William and Harry followed their father in laying wreaths during the ceremony, as Kate Middleton and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a>  watched the ceremony from balconies.</p>
      <p>Political leaders, including Prime Minister  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a>  and Labour's  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>  , took a break from election campaigning to attend the service at the memorial.</p>

      <p>During the ceremony thousands of veterans and servicemen and women marched past the Cenotaph to pay their respects to those killed in past and present conflicts.</p>
      <p>Buglers of the Royal Marines sounded the Last Post before the wreaths were laid by members of the royal family, politicians, foreign representatives and senior armed forces personnel.</p>
      <p>Five former prime ministers, Sir John Major,  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a>  , Gordon Brown, David Cameron and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a>  were at the event.</p>
      <p>Other royals who attended included Prince William, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> and Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>After the service, Andrew took the Salute at the March Past of Veteran Organisations on Horse Guards Parade.</p>
