        <figcaption>"Vigil" features Jodi, of Deer Isle, Maine, who served as a Coast Guard BMI Petty Officer (1982-91), and in the Reserves (1991-2004). <br/>For her project titled "We the People," watercolorist Mary Whyte set out to paint 50 veterans from 50 states. The men and women included in the exhibition, on display in Fall 2019 at the City Gallery in Charleston, S.C., are as diverse as the nation they served.<cite>Credit: Mary Whyte</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>"Holsteins" features Darrell, of Norwood, Mo., who was Army E-4 (1968-71).<br/>Mary Whyte began her project, titled "We the People," to depict the diversity of our nation. "I thought, what if I painted all of America, I mean this idea of one person from each of the 50 states?" Whyte told "Sunday Morning" correspondent Martha Teichner. "And that's when it occurred to me that I do believe that our veterans are our greatest patriots – anyone willing to lay down their life for our country, that's what truly makes a person most American."<cite>Credit: Mary Whyte</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>Mary Whyte traveled the country sketching, interviewing and photographing along the way. The paintings - watercolor on paper - took her seven years to complete. <br/>"Manhood" shows two veterans working in a Tennessee barber shop: Jason, of Blountville (Marines Lance Corporal E-3, 1999-2002) and, in the mirror, Daniel, of Kingsport (Army Specialist E-4, 1990-95).<cite>Credit: Mary Whyte</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>"America" depicts Kella Withhorn, of Aberdeen, S.D., in her handmade Lakota regalia. She served as an Army SP4 (1986-88). <br/>Withhorn joined the Army at 20, assuming college wasn't an option. "When I left home, I was such a shy kid. I never flew on a plane, didn't know how to get on an escalator, I was just scared to death," she told Teichner. "And being in the military just opened my eyes to the world. I got to meet all kinds of people, and it helped me grow."<br/>Now she has a master's degree, and is a budget analyst for the federal government.<cite>Credit: Mary Whyte</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>"Battleground" features Casey Maidl, of Bend, Ore., an Army Sergeant A-5, 19th SFG (2001- ). <br/>"When I first came back before my symptoms appeared, like most veterans, at the time you feel invincible. You had this experience, you served your nation," he told Martha Teichner. "But, my PTSD symptoms caught up to me, and they've made it extremely challenging to remain in public service."<br/>"But you have," said correspondent Martha Teichner.<br/>"I've struggled to do it. Driving a fire engine, the loud noises, working on the 4th of July, it's very triggering because of the fireworks."<br/>Maidl's lifeline is his service dog, Bannar, named for a close friend who served with him and died in action.<cite>Credit: Mary Whyte</cite></figcaption>
