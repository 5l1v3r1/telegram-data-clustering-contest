      <p>Neymar has a great link with Barcelona. Since he signed for the club in 2013, he's felt comfortable in the city and that means he likes to come back from time to time, even though he's now at PSG.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian star arrived in his private jet to spend the weekend in the Catalan capital. After watching PSG beat Brest, he came to Barcelona to spend some time with his pals. Given the international break is now, he could spend some time here.</p>
      <p>Neymar finds himself in a recovery period at the moment after suffering an injury in a friendly with Brazil against Nigeria on October 14. He is likely to reappear against Lille on November 22 if everything goes to plan - and then face Real Madrid in the Champions League.</p>
