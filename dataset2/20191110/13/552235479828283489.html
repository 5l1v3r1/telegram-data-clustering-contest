      <h2>The Ibrox side are flying high off the back of their impressive win against Porto midweek.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T13:58:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers will do battle with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> in their quest to topple Celtic from the Premiership summit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>'s trail their city rivals only by goal difference and can keep the heat on with a win in West Lothian.</p>
      <p>Livi are no pushovers, however, defeating <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> last month. They also made <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> work for a 1-0 Betfred Cup success earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>The Light Blues dispatched Porto in the Europa League in mid-week, and this clash has been given an extra edge by Gary Holt taking aiming at his counterpart Gerrard.</p>
      <p>Here's all the details you need to know ahead of the Premiership clash.</p>
