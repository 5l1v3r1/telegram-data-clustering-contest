        <b>Daniel Ricciardo says that he only had one issue with Max Verstappen during their almost three years as teammates, despite the pair clashing on track multiple times. The duo shared the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing garage from the Spanish Grand Prix in 2016 until the end of last season, with the Australian moving on to Renault.</b>

      <p>Being competitive teammates in F1 can often ruin friendships, but the one between these two seems to have gone the other way, with the pair often seen chatting and joking with each other in the paddock.</p>

      <p>In fact, Ricciardo's problem with the Dutchman was down to his aggressive driving style.</p>
      <p>He told Sky Sports F1: <i>“I respect Max for the way he stands up for himself.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I guess the only problem I had with him was the same as what most drivers had with him when he first got into F1 and that was the moving under braking.”</i>
