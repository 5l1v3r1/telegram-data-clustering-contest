      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 10 — PKR MP Nurul Izzah Anwar is said to have invited Cambodia's opposition figure Sam Rainsy to meet in Malaysia's Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cambodia's opposition party Cambodia National Rescue Party's (CNRP) Seng Mengbunrong took to Twitter yesterday to thank Nurul Izzah for the invite.</p>
      <p>“Thank You HE. @n_izzah for invite my Leader @RainsySam to the meeting to discuss the way forward in pursuing the best socio developmental pathways for both #Malaysia and #Cambodia,” he wrote, also attaching a letter from Nurul Izzah in her capacity as Permatang Pauh MP.</p>
      <p>Both CNRP and Rainsy have retweeted the tweet by Seng Mengbunrong, who is also an aide to CNRP vice-president Mu Sochua.</p>
      <p>The letter dated November 9 showed Nurul Izzah as inviting CNRP co-founder and acting president Rainsy and his wife and fellow opposition figure Tioulong Saumura for a meeting with "Malaysian legislatures."</p>

      <p>The meeting is set for noon on Tuesday in Parliament “to discuss the way forward in pursuing the best socio developmental pathways for both Malaysia and Cambodia.”</p>
      <p><i>Malay Mail</i> has yet to receive a response from Nurul Izzah regarding the invitation.</p>
      <p>Rainsy, who has been self-exiled from his home country Cambodia for years, yesterday landed in Kuala Lumpur International Airport after flying in from Paris, France.</p>
      <p>Rainsy was reported saying by news wire Reuters that he would speak to Malaysian MPs next Tuesday and would be meeting “like-minded friends” in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>He had initially planned to return to Cambodia by yesterday but Thai Airways had on Thursday reportedly barred him from boarding a flight from Paris to Thailand.</p>
      <p>Yesterday was Cambodia's Independence Day.</p>
