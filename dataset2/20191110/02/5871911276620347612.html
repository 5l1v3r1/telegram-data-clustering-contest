      <p>LSU defeated Alabama for the first time since 2011 on Saturday, in a game they controlled from start to finish, riding red-hot quarterback Joe Burrow to victory.</p>
      <p>The Tigers coaching staff called a masterful game, using a variety of different looks to mix it up well on offense, and getting turnovers on the defensive side of the ball to win.</p>
      <p>LSU may have been six-point underdogs in the game, but bettors lined up to back them, and sportsbooks got hit big-time. Head coach Ed Orgeron had a strong belief in his team leading up to the contest, and his confidence spilled over in to the locker room after the game, when he declared the following:</p>
      <p>“This is our house from now on!” Orgeron told his players, of Bryant-Denny Stadium.</p>

      <p>Not only that, he also went on an epic rant.</p>
      <p>“Roll tide?!? F— you!” he yelled.</p>
