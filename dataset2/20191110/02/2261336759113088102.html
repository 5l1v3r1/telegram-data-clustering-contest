      <h1>KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 highlights: Ronny Rios, Diego Pacheco score knockouts</h1>

      <p>The preliminary card for KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 is complete, and Staples Center was filled up quite nicely for the early action. They got treated to some highlight-reel stoppages and an in-ring marriage proposal, and you can see all of them in the clips below.</p>

      <p>Super-bantamweight Ronny Rios made short work of Hugo Berrio with a fourth-round KO. Rios was largely in control of the fight and walloped Berrio with a hard right hand that almost sent him through the ropes. Berrio got up, but he was groggy and taking a beating, so the corner did the sensible thing and threw in the towel.</p>

      <p>Next up, 18-year-old prospect Diego Pacheco outclassed a tough but overmatched Aaron Casper in a scheduled six-rounder. The 6’4” former amateur standout is plying his trade at super-middleweight at the moment, and he started and finished strongly. He scored a first-round knockdown, steadily picked apart Casper towards the end of round three, then delighted the local fans with two knockdowns to force the referee to save Casper from any more punishment.</p>

      <p>Lastly, Youtube star and MMA fighter Josh Brueckner won his pro boxing debut over fellow MMA fighter and boxing newcomer Tyler Smith. Brueckner took a shutout unanimous decision over four rounds, and while the fight was as club-level and not particularly interesting as you may expect, Brueckner took the opportunity not to call out Logan Paul or KSI, but his girlfriend (and fellow social media star) Katie Betzing. He proposed to her in the ring, and she said yes.</p>
