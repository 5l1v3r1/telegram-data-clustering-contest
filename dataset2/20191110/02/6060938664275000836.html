      <h1>ECB writes to ICC, won’t accept new FTP proposal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T02:52:38+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 02:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-K-Shriniwas-Rao-479202166.cms" target="_blank">K Shriniwas Rao</a></address>
      <p>MUMBAI: The England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ECB">ECB</a>), on Friday, wrote to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Manu-Sawhney">Manu Sawhney</a>, the Chief Executive at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Cricket-Council">International Cricket Council</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ICC">ICC</a>), informing the latter that they will “not support” the current proposal of the governing body’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Future-Tours-Program">Future Tours Program</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/FTP">FTP</a>) for the 2023-31 cycle.</p>
      <p>TOI had reported the same on Thursday, quoting top stakeholders in the ECB who had spoken on the condition of anonymity and said that their board would not sign the Members Participation Agreement (MPA) with the ICC. On Friday evening, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Colin-Graves">Colin Graves</a> – the ECB chairman – wrote on the same lines.</p>
      <p>“It is our view that the current proposal for ICC Events post 2023 significantly risks marginalising bilateral cricket for many ICC Member Boards, including ECB, as well as potentially devaluing the status of ICC world championship events through their increased frequency. ECB cannot support a schedule that requires our best players to play more than they currently do,” Graves’ letter read.</p>
      <p>As a result, the ECB chairman added, his board “will not be in a position to support the proposal for ICC events from 2023-31. The impact of the proposed schedule on bilateral cricket, Graves added, “is a serious concern for ECB”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, TOI understands that Cricket Australia (CA) is all set to follow the same route very soon. Well-placed sources told this newspaper that CA finds itself in the same space as the ECB in the present times, owing to the ICC’s recently proposed schedules and the accompanying risk of compromising the value of the bilateral cricket calendar for all member boards.</p>
      <p>“In the recent board meeting in Dubai, CA and ECB were on the same page on all matters concerning the proposed scheduling for the next rights cycle. The BCCI was a bystander in most things,” sources said.</p>
