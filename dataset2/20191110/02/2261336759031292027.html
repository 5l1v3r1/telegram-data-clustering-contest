      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T799ovthOTI">As reported by TMZ Sports</a>, Jake Paul, Logan’s younger brother, has been in the business of taunting Danis, including bragging about having “hooked up” with Danis’s girlfriend. For his part, Danis has said he’d gladly fight Paul, a fight Coach<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jake-paul-dillon-danis-fight-john-kavanagh-mma-2019-9"> Kavanagh said would be “embarrassing”</a> for Paul.</p>
      <p>Danis had planned on attending the fight with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/boxing/10303784/ksi-vs-logan-paul-dillon-danis-banned/">Bellator boss Scott Coker</a>, which presumably would keep Danis on a tight leash.

At UFC 229, Danis was at the center of the now <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/ufc-229-results-stream-fight-card-news-highlights-conor-mcgregor-khabib-nurmagomedov-mma/2018/10/7/17947348/raw-video-khabib-leaps-into-ufc-229-crowd-attacks-dillon-danis-after-conor-mcgregor-fight-mma">infamous brawl</a>. Hearn refused to engage with Danis when asked by the fighter why he was being banned.</p>
