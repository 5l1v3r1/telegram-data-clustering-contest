      <h1>Nicki Minaj Says She Won't Post On Instagram Anymore After They Remove Likes</h1>

      <p>Nicki Minaj is apparently getting off the gram if they remove her likes. Earlier this week, the company announced that it will start testing a feature in the United States that will hide likes from showing on certain accounts.</p>

      <p>“I’m not posting on IG after this week cuz they removing the likes,” she wrote on Twitter. “Hmmmm what should I get into now? Think of all the time I’ll have with my new life.”</p>
      <p>The testing will be rolled out only for a select group of users beginning next week, so Nicki may be speaking too soon. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29746801/instagram-hiding-likes-in-the-united-states-testing/">recently spoke</a> on the initiative with <i>Wired</i>’s Arielle Pardes and actor Tracee Ellis Ross saying that “it’s about young people.”</p>
      <p>“The idea is to try and depressurize Instagram. Make it less of a competition. Give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love, things that inspire them,” he said. “But it’s really focused on young people. We have to see how it affects how people feel about the platform, how they use the platform, how it affects creator ecosystem, but I’ve been spending a lot of time on this personally.”</p>
      <p>The company has already rolled out the feature in other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Ireland, Italy, and Brazil. The feature will still allow users to see likes on their end, but they will be hidden from public view. It’s unclear if that makes it any better for Nicki.</p>
