      <h3>Bitcoin Price: Consolidation And Retracement</h3>
      <p>A week of consolidation for BTC price this week, whilst people were still arguing over <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/did-us-regulatory-filing-really-cause-bitcoin-xi-pump/">what caused the ‘Xi’ pump</a> of two weeks ago. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-suggest-renewed-hodling-period/">Outflows from Bitcoin exchanges</a> have overtaken inflows in recent weeks, suggesting a potential renewed HODLing period.</p>
      <p>The first part of the week saw modest gains with price pushing for but not quite reaching $9500 on global markets. One exception was in Argentina, where stricter capital controls have seen <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-breaks-12k-on-argentinian-crypto-exchange/">premiums on local exchanges</a>, with the price hitting $11.6k.</p>
      <p>According to an alternate take on the stock-to-flow method, we may have to wait until after next year’s halving for a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-holding-explosive-rally-for-post-halving/">new all-time high</a>. Certainly price seemed quite happy to trade sideways… for a while.</p>
      <p>Then on Thursday, bitcoin price <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-price-dips-despite-positive-us-china-trade-talks/">began to dip</a>, developing into a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-btc-dips-below-usd-9000-stocks-slump/">$500 crash on Friday</a>. Crypto Twitter took a decidedly bearish turn, although some suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-is-this-a-crash-or-just-retracement/">this was unwarranted</a>. Certainly, price has continued to trade sideways at around $8800 since the drop.</p>
      <p>To finish on a bullish note, crypto-stalwart Bobby Lee threw his hat into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-price-usd-1-million-after-two-more-bubbles/">$1 million bitcoin prediction</a> ring. According to Lee, the figure will be reached in about 5 to 10 years, after two more bubbles.</p>
      <h3>Getting On The Bitcoin and Digital Currency Train</h3>
      <p>No further news of China’s state-backed digital currency this week, but we did find out that Turkey could possibly beat it to the punch. Plans for a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/turkey-prepares-to-mint-crypto-lira/">digital Lira</a> are well underway, with a potential launch next year.</p>
      <p>There were also reports that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/eu-might-issue-digital-currency-in-response-to-libra/">European Union might introduce a public digital currency</a>, to counteract the influence of Facebook’s Libra.</p>
      <p>A former head of the Chinese Central Bank even suggested that Libra might be better served if it was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/libra-better-in-imf-custody-ex-chinese-central-banker/">under the control of the IMF</a>.</p>
      <h3>News In Brief</h3>
      <p>Last week’s leak of customer email addresses by BitMEX, has lead to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitmex-leaked-emails-lead-to-compromised-accounts/">a number of accounts being compromised</a>. Customers were advised to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if they have any concerns about account security.</p>
      <p>Since China’s announcement of intent regarding blockchain, it has started to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/beijing-increases-censorship-surveillance-amid-blockchain-push/">censor news articles</a> denouncing the technology. Ironically, there had previously been moves to delete pro-blockchain articles.</p>
      <p>The Winklevii’s Gemini Exchange added <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-exchange-adds-automated-customer-tax-reporting/">automated tax reporting</a> for its customers this week… which is nice if you like that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>Bakkt has continued to build strongly on its perhaps underwhelming start. This week saw the company record its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-second-best-volume-day/">second highest Bitcoin futures</a> volume, followed closely by its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-set-new-record-amid-btc-dump/">highest ever daily volume</a>.</p>
      <h3>And Finally…</h3>
      <p>The power struggle at Bitmain seems to be hotting up.</p>
      <p>Co-founder Micree Zhan, who was ousted by the returning Jihan Wu last week, showed that he isn’t going down without a fight.</p>
      <p>Describing his own removal as a coup without consent, he vowed to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitmain-power-struggle-heats-up-as-co-founder-wrestles-for-control/">retake control of the company</a> through legal action.</p>
