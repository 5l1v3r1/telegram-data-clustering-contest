      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:03:20+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/foreign/africa/361899-incumbent-mauritius-pm-wins-five-year-election-mandate.html" target="_blank">allAfrica</a></address>
      <p>The ruling Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) has won more than half of the seats in parliament, securing incumbent Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth a five-year term, Reuters<b> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mauritius-election/mauritius-starts-counting-votes-after-parliamentary-election-idUSKBN1XI177">reports</a></b>.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Jugnauth’s coalition won four more seats in the final allocation to hold 42 of 70 parliamentary seats following the November 7 polls , securing an outright majority needed to form government alone, a victory that has reinforced the legitimacy of a leader who took over from his father without going through a vote.</p>
      <p>In January 2017, he was<a href="https://allafrica.com/stories/201701240728.html"> <b>chosen as the next Prime Minister</b></a> by his father and leader of the coalition government, Anerood Jugnauth, following his resignation.</p>
      <p>Sir Anerood was leader of the Alliance Lepep coalition and the longest-serving prime minister since Mauritius gained independence from Britain in 1968. Jugnauth, on the other hand, leads the Militant Socialist Movement party.</p>
      <p>Some 723,660 voters, 76.845 of those eligible, turned out for the ballot, the <b><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mauritius-election/mauritius-starts-counting-votes-after-parliamentary-election-idUSKBN1XI177">report</a></b> says. The turnout was 2% higher than the last election.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties, argue that the Jugnauth family’s rule has been marked by nepotism and corruption.</p>
