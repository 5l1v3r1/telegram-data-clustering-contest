      <h1>Instagram to hide likes from users in US to stop platform ‘feeling like a competition’</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a> has announced that some users in the US will next week have their “likes” hidden from posts on the social media platform. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the company began trialling the measure in countries including Ireland, Italy and Australia.</p>
      <p>The aim of hiding likes, the company stated, is to remove the element of “pressure” from the social media platform and to stop it feeling “like a competition”.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been testing making likes private on Instagram in a number of countries this year,” said Adam Mosseri, chief executive of the firm.</p>
      <p>“We’re expanding those tests to include a small portion of people in the US next week. Looking forward to the feedback!”</p>
      <p>When likes on Instagram are made private, this means that only users are able to see the number of likes their posts receive.</p>
      <p>When other users look at their posts, they are only able to see the name of one account that has liked a picture, in addition to “others”.</p>
      <p>Instagram first trialled hiding likes on the platform in Canada in May, before rolling out the feature in countries including Brazil, Japan and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The social media platform previously said that measurement tools for business accounts would not be affected by the update.</p>
      <p>Last month, it was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/instagram-filters-plastic-surgery-face-spark-ar-statement-facebook-a9167186.html">announced</a> that Instagram face filters that allow users to look as though they have undergone plastic surgery were to be removed.</p>
      <p>Spark AR, the augmented reality platform that creates the filters, released a statement announcing the update on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The company said it was re-evaluating its “existing policies as they relate to well-being”, saying that they want those who use Spark AR effects to have a “positive experience”.</p>
