      <p>Police have a suspect in custody for allegedly stabbing a "Baby Trump" balloon during a protest.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred on Saturday near the near the University of Alabama, where President Trump attended a football game against Louisiana State University. Hoyt Hutchinson, 32, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-arrested-for-stabbing-baby-trump-protest-balloon-at-alabama-lsu-game">reportedly</a> posted a Facebook Live claiming he was planning to deflate the giant balloon, which resembles a baby version of the president crying and holding a cell phone.</p>
      <p>"I’m going down here to make a scene, so y’all watch the news. If you've got any balls, come join me. This is pathetic. I’m fixing to get rowdy," he said in the video. "I’m shaking, I’m so mad right now. I’m fixing to pop this balloon, without a doubt. Stay tuned, this should be interesting."</p>

      <p>Hutchinson later charged the balloon and used a knife to slash an 8-foot gash in its back, according to witnesses. He was arrested and charged with felony first-degree criminal mischief and <a href="https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20191109/suspect-accused-of-stabbing-baby-trump-balloon">has opened</a> a crowdsourcing page to raise money for his legal fees and restitution. His bond was set at $2,500.</p>

      <p>The "Baby Trump" balloon first gained international attention when <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giant-trump-baby-blimp-in-the-works-to-protest-uk-visit">activists in London erected it</a> ahead of Trump's 2018 visit to the city. Replicas of the balloon have popped up worldwide in protest of the president ever since, including some in the United States. Over the summer, a woman <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/stop-resisting-woman-arrested-for-stabbing-trump-baby-balloon-in-london">was arrested</a> in the United Kingdom for popping a version of it.</p>
      <p>Donors contributed over $7,000 to bring the balloon to Alabama this weekend. Of the donations, $4,500 went to the rental cost for the balloon, but the remainder of the funds raised were donated to Equal Justice Initiative.</p>
