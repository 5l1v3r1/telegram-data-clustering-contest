      <h1>William Hughes, Congressman and Ambassador, Dies at 87</h1>

      <p>William J. Hughes, who served 20 years in Congress representing the Second District of New Jersey and then was United States ambassador to Panama during the years leading up to the transfer of control of the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama, died on Oct. 30 at his home in Ocean City, N.J. He was 87.</p>
      <p>The Godfrey Funeral Homes posted <a href="https://godfreyfuneralhome.com/tribute/details/1671/William-Hughes-Sr/obituary.html">his funeral notice</a>.</p>
      <p>In Congress, Mr. Hughes, a Democrat, was known for his work on issues related to senior citizens, the environment and gun control. For most of the 1980s, he was chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime, a period that produced a ban on armor-piercing bullets and some attempts to limit assault weapons and tighten record-keeping on handguns, among other proposals.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes said he was not anti-gun — “I’m a hunter myself, and I own guns myself,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/15/nyregion/gun-control-is-crucial-issue-in-challenge-to-congressman.html?searchResultPosition=3&amp;module=inline">told The New York Times</a> in 1992 — but the National Rifle Association continually opposed his initiatives, and his political enemies zeroed in on the gun issue when he ran for re-election in 1992.</p>
      <p>Anonymous fliers circulated that fall pictured a saluting Adolf Hitler above the words: “Everyone in favor of gun control raise your right hand. Dump Bill Hughes.” (His election opponent, Frank LoBiondo, said he had no connection to the fliers and condemned them.)</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes won that election, which turned out to be his last. He declined to run again in 1994 (Mr. LoBiondo, a Republican, won the seat that year), and in 1995 President Bill Clinton named Mr. Hughes ambassador to Panama. He served in that post until October 1998. In 1999, completing a 20-year process set in motion by treaties signed during President Jimmy Carter’s administration in the 1970s, control of the Panama Canal was formally transferred to Panama.</p>
      <p>Among the honors Mr. Hughes received in his home state was the dedication, in 2008, of a research center at Stockton University in Galloway, N.J., in his honor. New Jersey’s current governor, Phil Murphy, invoked it in a tribute <a href="https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562019/approved/20191103a.shtml">posted on his official website</a>.</p>
      <p>“Congressman Hughes will continue to inspire future leaders through the work of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University,” the governor said, “perhaps the most fitting tribute to his tremendous legacy.”</p>
      <p>William John Hughes was born on Oct. 17, 1932, in Salem, N.J., in the southwest part of the state, to William Wesley Hughes and Pauline Hughes Mehaffey. He grew up in nearby Penns Grove, graduating from Penns Grove Regional High School in 1950.</p>
      <p>He graduated from Rutgers University in 1955 and earned a law degree at the Rutgers law school in Camden, N.J., in 1958.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes joined the law firm of Loveland, Hughes and Garret in Ocean City.</p>
      <p>“Much of my work was in the area of wills and trusts and estates,” he told the States News Service in 1993, explaining how he had come to serve on the House Select Committee on Aging, “and I represented a lot of senior citizens who had no families.”</p>
      <p>He was first assistant prosecutor for Cape May County, N.J., from 1960 to 1970, accounting for another area of interest once he was elected to Congress, crime. He first ran for Congress in 1970, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Charles W. Sandman Jr.</p>
      <p>Four years later, though, after Mr. Sandman had gained notoriety for his aggressive defense of President Richard M. Nixon as the House Judiciary Committee was considering articles of impeachment, Mr. Hughes used that against him.</p>
      <p>“When Sandman spoke,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/29/archives/sandmans-aggressive-defense-of-nixon-imperils-his-chances-of.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline">told The Times</a> just before the election that November, “the nation either laughed or wept, and the people were disgusted with that they saw: a sneering, sarcastic, old-line politician who behaved like a carnival barker and one who couldn’t possibly see right from wrong.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes won handily, and challengers in his subsequent elections didn’t come close to defeating him. In 1990, the Republicans didn’t bother to field a candidate.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes’s subcommittee on crime produced legislation to fight drug trafficking, child pornography and other problems. Also during his congressional tenure, he championed a ban on coastal dumping — his district included the southern part of the Jersey Shore — and secured preservation of parts of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the wild, heavily forested area in the southern part of the state.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes married Nancy Gibson in 1956. She died last year. He is survived by a brother, Daniel; three daughters, Lynne Hughes, Barbara Hughes Sullivan and Tama Hughes; a son, William Jr.; 10 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hughes’s wife died after an eight-year battle with a progressive neurodegenerative disease, The Press of Atlantic City <a href="https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/nancy-hughes-wife-of-ambassador-william-j-hughes-dies-at/article_e2069700-2ba1-55c3-826b-3639389221b6.html">said in her obituary</a>. He was her primary caregiver during that time.</p>
      <p>“My mom lived longer because of my dad,” Lynne Hughes told the newspaper.</p>
