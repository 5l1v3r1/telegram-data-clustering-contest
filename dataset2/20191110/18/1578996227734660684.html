      <h1>Chrissy Teigen Looks Amazing in Pale Green Gown at Gala</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:25:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author">Erika Harwood</a></address>
      <p>Chrissy Teigen was a green goddess on the red carpet Saturday, wearing a sparkling one-shoulder gown to the Baby2Baby gala. The model appeared alongside her husband, John Legend, at the event, which was also attended by Kate Hudson, Kirsten Dunst, and Jessica Alba.</p>
      <p>Teigen, who’s become known for her funny Twitter account, recently sparked controversy with a tweet about her mom’s relationship with Airpods.</p>
      <p>“My mom treats her air pods like they're disposable. Buys a few a month. She says they would be easier to not lose if they had....a cord,” she wrote on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Some called her out for being tone deaf to privilege, which Teigen acknowledged and apologized for.</p>
      <p>“Oh man, I haven’t checked my mentions for a bit and I didn’t realize how many people were super pissed off about this,” <a href="https://www.etonline.com/chrissy-teigen-apologizes-for-her-tone-deaf-joke-about-her-mom-135906">she later tweeted</a>. “It was meant as a joke (and exaggeration) about how my mom doesn’t realize air pods are with a cord are headphones but it came across as super tone deaf and icky.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Teigen’s Twitter account has made the news. Back in September, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/09/politics/trump-teigen-twitter-feud-trnd/index.html">tweeted about Teigen and Legend</a> while venting on Twitter, per usual, about how republicans deserved more credit for signing the First Step Act into law.</p>
      <p>“I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, &amp; Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise,” he wrote. “Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn't see them around when we needed help getting it passed.”</p>
      <p>Teigen used that “filthy mouth” to call him out <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1170914148919590914">writing</a>, “lol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president.”</p>
