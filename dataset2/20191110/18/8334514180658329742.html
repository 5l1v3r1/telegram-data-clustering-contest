      <p>ROME (Reuters) - An explosive device was detonated in northern Iraq on Sunday as a vehicle carrying Italian special forces drove nearby, injuring five soldiers, three of them seriously, the Italian military said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The attack happened near the city of Kirkuk. The wounded men were evacuated by U.S. helicopters to a military hospital in Baghdad, where one had to have a leg amputated, a military official told state broadcaster RAI.</p>
      <p>“Our men were training Iraqi security forces engaged in fighting ISIS,” Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said, referring to the Islamic State militant group.</p>
      <p>“I am following the situation with sorrow and apprehension,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The blast happened three days before the 16th anniversary of a suicide attack in the southern Iraqi city of Nassiriya, which killed 18 Italian servicemen, an Italian civilian and nine Iraqi civilians.</p>
