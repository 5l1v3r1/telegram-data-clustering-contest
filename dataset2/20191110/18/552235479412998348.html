      <h1>Glasgow MP in war of words with council chiefs over derelict pub The Talisman</h1>
      <h2>Paul Sweeney has hit out at Glasgow City Council for failing to demolish The Talisman boozer which called last orders more than 20 years ago.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:50:57+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Stewart, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stephen-stewart/</a></address>
      <p>A crusading politician has declared war - on an old pub.</p>
      <p>Glasgow MP <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-ross-thomsons-ex-20804743">Paul Sweeney</a> has slammed authorities for failing to demolish The Talisman boozer which called last orders more than 20 years ago.</p>
      <p>He said the Springburn pub, built by Scottish and Newcastle Breweries in 1966 as part of the Balgrayhill housing scheme, was an eyesore as well as a danger to kids and a fire risk.</p>
      <p>Sweeney said hopes were raised when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snp-blasted-social-media-spin-20731577">Scottish Government</a> plans to introduce compulsory sale order powers for local authorities were announced. Those plans, though, have now been scrapped.</p>
      <p>He called for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/uk-government-rejecting-fix-rooms-20818254">Glasgow City Council</a> to serve a notice to repair or demolish the building or use the city's emergency demolition fund to clear the site.</p>
      <p>He claimed that the council's response said that some dangerous sections had been removed while what remains was structurally safe.</p>

      <p>The Glasgow North East MP said: "This is more than 'disappointing' for the people who have to endure this eyesore in their community.</p>
      <p>“Glasgow City Council's failure to act exposes the fact that the SNP government have dropped plans to give local authorities additional powers in this area. However it is unacceptable for Glasgow City Council to hide behind the current legislation.</p>
      <p>“The fact that this shell of a building is not at imminent risk of falling down is no cause for celebration. The unsecured site poses a danger to local children and a fire risk.</p>
      <p>“Wider regeneration efforts in Balgrayhill and Springburn are undermined by the council's refusal to grip this situation. More than 22 years since the Talisman last closed its doors it continues to blight our community.</p>
      <p>“If now is not the time to act then when?"</p>
      <p>A Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: “We’re currently reviewing the range of interventions the council can consider regarding the condition of the Talisman.</p>
      <p>"However, all options require careful legal assessment before progressing any action or interventions.”</p>
