      <p>The house where a couple were both found dead with 'severe injuries' is a women's refuge, according to neighbours.</p>
      <p>Police found a man and a woman who had both died from serious injuries after they were called to a Victorian property in Moseley, Birmingham, at 5.30pm yesterday.</p>
      <p>The pair, who were both 28 years old, had suffered serious injuries and were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Police say they were known to each other but did not live at the same address.</p>
      <p>Today neighbours have said the block of flats where the man and woman were found is run by Trident Reach, a charity offering a domestic abuse support service in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Neighbour Abba Khan Amedi, 73, a retired auditor, said: "It’s a hostel for women."</p>

      <p>Raymond Price, 61, a driver, said: "It’s a hostel as far as I know. It’s owned by Trident."</p>
      <p>Retired nurse Diana West, 77, added: "I think it’s a hostel for vulnerable women. It’s very quiet normally."</p>
      <p>Officers say they are knot looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has approached Trident for comment.</p>
      <p>Yesterday a neighbour claimed officers brought out a knife in an evidence container.</p>
      <p>The resident told <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/live-updates-couple-dead-moseley-17231141">BirminghamLive:</a> "I heard police car after police car after police car.</p>
      <p>"I looked out of my window and saw ambulances, police cars, armed police, police with dogs.</p>
      <p>"I went outside and walked up the road. The road wasn’t closed off at this point but police were telling people to turn back.</p>
      <p>"Then five minutes later, the police blocked the road off. They put the tape up.</p>
      <p>"Officers brought out a knife in an evidence container."</p>
      <p>A statement from West Midlands Police this afternoon says: "Investigations continue today into the deaths of two people at a property in Moseley, Birmingham.</p>
      <p>"The bodies of the man and woman, both aged 28, were found just before 5.30pm yesterday (9 Nov) in a flat off Oxford Road.</p>
      <p>"The couple were known to each other but did not reside at the same address.</p>
      <p>"Post mortem examinations will take place in due course, but detectives confirmed they are not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths."</p>
