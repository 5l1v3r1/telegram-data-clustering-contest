      <p>Yemen's rebels will have a role in their country's future, a minister of the United Arab Emirates (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-arab-emirates.html">UAE</a>) has said, voicing optimism that a recent peace deal between the government and southern separatists could lead to a wider political solution to years of war.</p>
      <p>The comments on Sunday were the latest conciliatory move in the long-running <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/yemen.html">Yemen</a> conflict after the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a>-aligned Houthis offered in September to halt attacks on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>
      <p>Anwar Gargash, minister of state for foreign affairs in the UAE - a key member in the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government against the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/houthis.html">Houthi rebels</a> - urged all sides to maintain momentum for a political resolution.</p>
      <p>"Such an agreement must take account of the legitimate aspirations of all parts of Yemeni society. That includes the Houthis," Gargash said at a political conference in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>"Houthi militias have wreaked havoc on the country, but they are a part of Yemeni society and they will have a role in its future."</p>
      <h3>'Build on momentum'</h3>
      <p>The Houthi rebels have been fighting the internationally recognised government and its allies for more than four years in a war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.</p>
      <p>But Gargash said he was hopeful a power-sharing deal between the government and the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, signed in Riyadh last week, could pave the way for a wider peace deal.</p>
      <p>"The agreement solidifies the anti-Houthi coalition and provides a more robust basis for reaching a political solution," he said. "Now we need to build on the momentum this has given us."</p>
      <p>The so-called Riyadh agreement would see Yemen's government return to Aden - the interim capital seized by separatists in August - and place the forces from both sides under the authority of the defence and interior ministries.</p>
      <p>Gargash's comments came after a rally organised by the Houthis to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad on Saturday drew hundreds of thousands in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, a much larger crowd than last year.</p>
      <p>Rebel chief Abdul Malik al-Houthi addressed the crowd via a video message played on a large screen, while many chanted slogans in support of the rebel leader.</p>
      <p>The Iran-aligned rebels took Sanaa in 2015 after which Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and their allies intervened in the conflict in support of President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abd-rabbu-mansour-hadi.html">Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed in a conflict that has triggered what the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html">United Nations</a> describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p>

      <h3>Renewed diplomatic efforts</h3>
      <p>Gargash also said more must be done to improve diplomatic relations with Iran.     </p>
      <p>"When it comes to dealing with Iran, we should not fall for the false choice between war on the one hand or a flawed [nuclear deal] on the other," Gargash said.</p>
      <p>"This moment requires a renewed, robust and realistic diplomatic effort to reach a more sustainable agreement," Gargash told a political conference in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>Gargash said escalation serves no one.</p>
      <p>"We strongly believe that there is room for collective diplomacy to succeed," he said, adding talks with Iran should involve the international community as well as Arab Gulf states.</p>
      <p>"Gulf states would need to be at the negotiating table," he said.</p>
      <p>A "meaningful political process" was needed, he added.</p>
      <p>"For such a process to work, it is essential that the international community is on the same page, especially the US and the EU, as well as the Arab Gulf states."</p>
