        <b>Liverpool dominated the first half in their top of the table clash against Manchester City on Sunday evening at Anfield scoring twice in the opening twenty minutes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a brilliant first 45 minutes against the reigning champions from Jurgen Klopp’s side but their opening goal appeared to come in controversial fashion.</p>
      <p>In the lead-up to Fabinho’s scintillating strike which fizzed past a helpless Claudio Bravo in the City net, it looked as though Trent Alexander-Arnold had handled the ball in the opposing box when Guardiola’s side were on the attack.</p>

      <p>The replays showed that the ball did in fact hit the defender’s hand but the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/10/liverpool-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live">Premier League released a statement</a> during half-time in the game outlining their reasons behind not giving Manchester City a penalty.</p>
      <blockquote>“The VAR checked the penalty appeal for handball against Trent Alexander-Arnold and confirmed the on-field decision that it did not meet the considerations for a deliberate handball.”</blockquote>
      <p>Salah soon grabbed a second which was also cleared by VAR, before Sadio Mané headed home a third goal thanks to a brilliant cross from captain Jordan Henderson early in the second half.</p>

      <p>City grabbed a goal back through Bernardo Silva but it was too little too late as The Reds ran out 3-1 winners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/jose-mourinho-liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league/">Liverpool’s</a> impressive victory puts them eight points clear of Leicester City at the top of the Premier League table and nine points clear of City who drop down to fourth.</p>
