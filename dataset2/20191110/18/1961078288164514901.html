      <p>On Nov. 11, 1918, the Allied nations and Germany signed an armistice ending the fighting in the Great War, which had killed more than 15 million people. A year later, King George V of England proclaimed that date Armistice Day, to be marked with two minutes of silence at 11 a.m., the hour the agreement had gone into effect.</p>
      <p>“King Asks British to Pause Two Minutes on Armistice Day,” The New York Times wrote in a <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/11/07/118178496.html?pageNumber=1">front-page headline</a> on Nov. 7, 1919. Days later, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/11/11/118180982.html?pageNumber=17">the paper reported</a> that Americans would be observing the day, too, with ceremonies around the country.</p>
      <p>In a special message to the nation in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson noted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/world/europe/world-war-i-brought-fundamental-changes-to-the-world.html?module=inline">the monumental changes</a> that the fierce and bloody war had provoked. The European Allies fought for more than four years, and the Americans for more than a year and a half. None would ever be the same. The fighting had destroyed empires, transformed Europe’s borders, spurred advances in weaponry and manufacturing, and brought millions of women into the work force.</p>

      <p>Wilson’s statement said:</p>
      <blockquote>With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns we remodeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. … Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes.</blockquote>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/opinion/versailles-treaty-woodrow-wilson.html?module=inline">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which formally ended the war, had been signed earlier that year, on June 28, 1919.</p>
      <p>In 1954, in response to calls for recognition of veterans of World War II and the Korean War, President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day. A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday in October, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11. The law took effect in 1978.</p>
      <p>Memorial Day, on the other hand, is observed on the last Monday in May. Whereas <a href="https://www.defense.gov/explore/story/article/1675470/5-facts-to-know-about-veterans-day/">Veterans Day honors all veterans</a>, Memorial Day specifically honors those who gave their lives for the United States.</p>
      <p>British Commonwealth nations and some other European countries also mark the anniversary of the armistice with ceremonies on or around <a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/remembrance/remembrance-events/remembrance-sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a>. In London, a National Service of Remembrance is held each year at <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-is-the-cenotaph">the Cenotaph</a>, a war memorial, and bright red paper <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-11-06/even-in-discordant-times-a-poignant-national-symbol-endures-in-britain">poppies are worn</a> as a symbol of support for the armed forces.</p>
      <p>In the bombed-out countryside of Western Europe after World War I, Flanders poppies, which were resilient enough to grow amid the destruction, <a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/remembrance/about-remembrance/the-poppy">became potent symbols</a>. A Canadian doctor, Lt. Col. John McCrae, described them in the poem “<a href="https://www.britishlegion.org.uk/get-involved/remembrance/about-remembrance/in-flanders-field">In Flanders Fields</a>.”</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion, a charity founded in 1921 that supports the armed forces, adopted the poppy as its emblem and set up a warehouse to employ disabled ex-servicemen to produce poppies. The tradition has endured, and public figures <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/james-mcclean-wont-wear-poppy-13505008">who have declined</a> to wear the poppy <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/by/jon-snow/blogs/wear-poppy-air">have faced criticism</a>. (There are also <a href="https://www.ppu.org.uk/remembrance-white-poppies">white poppies</a> for pacifists, <a href="https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/18022724.purple-poppy-celebration-dorchester-brewery-square/">purple ones</a> for animal lovers and, this year, <a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/2019/11/08/upset-about-the-rainbow-poppy-youve-been-duped-by-fake-news/">apparently false reports of rainbow ones</a> for supporters of L.G.B.T. rights.)</p>
      <p>The organization’s American corollary, the American Legion, also uses the red poppy as its official flower, and has promoted the Friday before Memorial Day as <a href="https://www.legion.org/poppyday">National Poppy Day</a>.</p>
