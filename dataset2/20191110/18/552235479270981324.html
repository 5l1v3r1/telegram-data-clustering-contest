      <h1>The Celtic acclaim that proves Rangers fans are jealous of rivals - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Gordon Parks mans the phones as a host of issues were discussed after Sunday's Premiership fixtures.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:34:53+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Only the odd goal separates the Old Firm at the top of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> and the Hotline has the title race too close to call</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> saw off Livingston with relative ease while <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> put Motherwell to the sword and many believe it'll be battles between the two which will determine who takes the crown.</p>
      <p><b>Craig Anderson, Lanark,</b> said: "The big two are now so dominant that it's difficult to see where they are going to drop points except against each other. They aren't being properly tested against the rest of the Premiership so the remaining three Old Firm games will prove decisive and they should all be crackers."</p>
      <p><b>Derek Carmichael, Glasgow</b> said: "It's all to easy for the big two, Motherwell were third but Celtic cruised it and after all the fuss made about Rangers going to Livingston, it proved a formality.</p>

      <p>"There's nothing between the two of them and whoever wins the title will have taken the most points in the remaining games against each other."</p>
      <p><b>Jimmy Strangers, Tranent,</b> said: "Livingston boss Gary Holt says <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> is wrong to single out Livingston for accidental elbow use but Rangers have suffered more injuries against Livi than any other SPFL side. Holt's side would be more suited to playing in the national rugby league and all these so called accidental elbows must be an entry for The Guinness Book of Records."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Jim McClean, Rothesay,</b> said: "What a ridiculous statement from Steve Gerrard about Livingston. It is not becoming of a Rangers manager and he has a short memory. There have been bad challenges from Ryan Jack, Alfredo Morelos and I could go on and on. He is totally out of order."</p>
      <p><b>Gordon Ashley, Ayr,</b> said: "Rangers fans who're moaning about the player ratings of Celtic against Lazio are only jealous that we are stealing the headlines from them by beating teams from the big five leagues rather than little countries like them. Lazio and Rennes have far bigger budgets than Porto and Feyenoord."</p>

      <p><b>Davie Knox, Queens Park,</b> said: “So Rod Stewart is upset by Charlie Nicholas predicting Celtic would lose in Rome. He’s paid for his opinions and most in the country would have agreed if you had looked at Celtic’s woeful away record in Europe.</p>
      <p>"The sooner Rangers return to their rightful place the better and kid-on fan Rod can get back to supporting Scotland." <br/>One Hibs fan's pint was half full after a win over St Johnstone.</p>
      <p><b>Kevin Lord, Edinburgh,</b> said: “One week on from losing to Celtic, playing two strikers and allowing full backs to cross the halfway line and the difference is there for all to see. Save us from these coaches who overthink every move and are scared to go and win."</p>

      <p><b>Andrew Lamb in Fraserburgh,</b> said: “St Johnstone fan Stuart Cosgrove keeps boasting that his club have zero debt, alas, the Perth club also have zero entertainment.  Here's hoping dull boss Tommy Wright is recruited by equally dull Northern Ireland, it's a match made in Heaven."</p>
      <p>There were a few calls about Record Sport's Chris Sutton and comments made about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> .</p>
      <p><b>Steven Richardson</b> , emailed: “Sutton reckons Rodgers will be jealous of how Celtic have done since he went to Leicester but he is now in the best league in Europe with far superior players compared with Celtic. Winning numerous Scottish titles counts for very little in comparison to the rest of Europe because Scottish football is and no Scottish team will stand a chance of winning the Champions League in the next 50 years.”</p>

      <p><b>David McVey, Margate,</b> said: Rodgers is getting twice the money at Leicester, twice the budget, manager in the best league in the world, at the moment in 2nd place in the league, has a team that would humiliate Celtic in a match, yes he must be pig sick that he has left Celtic. It’s been his ambition to manage a team that play with blue jerseys."</p>
      <p>And finally.</p>
      <p><b>Alan Heggie Grangemouth,</b> said: “As an ex-serviceman, Falkirk FC as a club, make me proud on the support they give for the fallen on remembrance weekend, pity the same cannot be said about the current football team, inept, no idea and no drive. This is all down to leadership and it’s time for Ray McKinnon to go.”</p>
