      <p>Charlie Flanagan says policing the border region has long been challenging as criminals have always sought to exploit the border - but adds there will be no hiding place for criminals.</p>
      <p>The Minister added he has every confidence that gardai and the PSNI are working together to prevent and investigate cross-border crime.</p>
      <p>He says the fruits of that cooperation were evident this week in a series of major searches.</p>
      <p>“Policing in the border region has long been very challenging as criminals have always sought to exploit that border," he said.</p>
      <p>"I have every confidence that An Garda Síochána and the PSNI are working together at historically close levels to prevent and investigate cross-border crime and the fruits of that cooperation were evident this week in a series of major searches.</p>
      <p>"I am pleased that 150 additional officers have been assigned to the region in the last two years following a difficult period for policing arising from the 2010 closure of Templemore College.”</p>
