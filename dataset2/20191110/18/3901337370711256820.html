      <h1>Fifth Draw For Ea Lla Koto, Cosmos Back In Drop Zone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:08:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>GladAfrica Championship log leaders, Uthongathi FC and second placed, JDR Stars, secured victories over Cape Umoya United and Swallows FC respectively, while lowly TS Sporting stunned high-flying Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila..</p>
      <p>In addition, three matches were drawn, including Jomo Cosmos very important clash with fellow-strugglers, Mbombela United.</p>
      <p>Thanks to two late goals by Njabulo Ngcobo and Cleopas Dube, the Cane Cutters grabbed their 25th point, which left the Spirited Ones mid-table after yet another defeat.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn Poggenpoel scored a penalty for Dominic Isaacs’ outfit.</p>
      <p>The Hammer Boys bounced back after three games without a win to pour more misery on the Birds, who’re thirteen points off the pace.</p>
      <p>Nigerian, Biodun Alabi, got his name on the scoresheet in the 6th minute via a spot kick and just before half time, Moeketsi Makhanya increased the lead.</p>
      <p>Although Brandon Truter’s team reduced the deficit through Kagiso Malinga, their efforts were ultimately insufficient.</p>
      <p>Abantu Bemthetho recorded only their second three-point haul after Kamohelo Sithole’s winner at the Kwabokweni Stadium.</p>
      <p>Sizwe Mdlinzo, TS Galaxy inflicted more misery on last-placed.</p>
      <p>The match between Free State Stars and Steenberg United ended all square at 2-2 with Ruzaigh Gamildien netting two penalties for the Cape Town team to bring his overall total to eight.</p>
      <p>The Rockets and Royal Eagles produced the same result in Kameelrivier, where Austin Dube and Sizwe Mdlinzo were on target for Dan Malesela’s side.</p>
      <p>At Olen Park, there were no goals when Cosmos entertained Mbombela but lots of drama as both sides were reduced to ten men following infringements.</p>
      <p>Ezenkosi returned to the relegation zone and together with Mbombela have netted a mere five times in ten games.</p>
