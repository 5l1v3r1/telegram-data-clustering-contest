      <h1>Shooters announce Tokyo readiness with 15 quotas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:04:12+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Tushar-Dutt-479120230.cms" target="_blank">Tushar Dutt</a></address>
      <p>PUNE: India will be fielding their largest shooting squad at an Olympics in Tokyo next year.</p>
      <p>The shooters surpassed their Rio de Janeiro figure of 12 quotas on Sunday by clinching three more berths at the ongoing Asian championships in Doha.</p>
      <p>Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, 18, sealed a spot in the men’s 50m rifle 3 Position while Angad Singh Bajwa and Mairaj Khan opened the account for shotgunners by sealing two skeet berths in the final quota event.</p>
      <p>While Bajwa defended his title, Mairaj settled for silver after a shoot-off in the gold-medal match with his teammate, thereby clinching two of the three quotas available in the event.</p>
      <p>In men’s 3P, young Aishwary claimed the bronze to secure the quota as five out of eight shooters in the final were vying for three Olympic berths.</p>
      <p>Aishwary, who had won gold with a World Record in the junior World Cup in Germany in July, was competing in his first final in a major international competition. He had earlier shot in the Minimum Qualification Score section in three World Cups this year (MQS scores do not qualify for medal rounds).</p>
      <p>"After his gold in the junior World Cup, we decided to shift gears and aim for the quota place. That was possible only if he made it to the senior team, so we decided to field him in the MQS category of the senior World Cups. His scores pushed him to the senior team," Aishwary’s coach Suma Shirur told TOI.</p>
      <p>"When I was asked to pick one from junior and senior, I went for the latter. I took it as a challenge," said the Madhya Pradesh boy, who shot 1168 in qualifying and 449.1 in the final.</p>
      <p>In 2016, India had won 12 quota places and contested for 17 medals (with a few shooters starting in more than one event).</p>
      <p>In Tokyo, the 15 quota places will give the Indian shooters a shot at 21 medals.</p>
      <p>The rifle and pistol shooters have been especially prolific, securing entry in nine out of the 10 disciplines. The men’s 25m rapid fire event is the only event where they have failed to qualify. Overall, India have not won a quota in five events (men’s and women’s trap, mixed trap, women’s skeet and 25m rapid fire). They still have a chance as the International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) is expected to distribute a few quota places based on world rankings.</p>
      <p>At the shotgun range, Bajwa and Mairaj saved the blushes despite the bad weather in Doha.</p>
      <p>"It rained first and there was a bad dust storm, and the play was stopped for some time. The conditions were bad for all of us but I am glad I could pull it off," said Bajwa, 23, who had clinched gold in the last year’s edition.</p>
      <p>"There was of course a lot of pressure before the match since we had not won any quota in shotgun events. But as the match progressed, I grew more confident. Earlier the aim was to win a quota, but then I aimed for gold and defend my title.</p>
      <p>"I got a lot of support from my teammate Amrinder Cheema, who helped me with my ammunition during the match," said Bajwa, who was tied with Mairaj at 56 in the final.</p>
      <p>The tie was broken by a shoot-off, where Bajwa shot 6, while Mairaj shot 5. Bajwa said he was in touch with his Norwegian coach Tore Brovold through phone after every round.</p>
      <p>In the 10m air pistol mixed final, India did a 1-2 as Manu Bhaker-Abhishek Verma pair won gold, while Saurabh Chaudhary-Yashaswini Deswal took silver.</p>
