      <p>The Golden Keys are flowing this weekend and Gearbox has kicked off Sunday with yet another <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-shift-codes/">Borderlands 3 Shift code</a> for you to claim. You can claim your key in-game, and open that Sanctuary chest for a chance at some sweet loot. Today's key expires at 10 am CST on Monday, November 11th. </p>
      <p>Here's your ticket for one Golden Key in Borderlands 3: <b>CS53B-FBS9J-95TK5-BJTT3-KJKTJ</b>.</p>
      <p>You can find more codes, including all the ones that <i>don't</i> expire, at our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-shift-codes/">Borderlands 3 Shift codes</a> hub, along with more details on how to use your Golden Keys. You can also cash in the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-vip-codes/">Borderlands VIP codes</a> that we have listed for you if you haven't already. Fortunately those have a better shelf life and don't often expire. See you for the next Shift Code!</p>
