      <h1>Livingston 0 Rangers 2: Clinical Gers far too strong for lacklustre Lions</h1>
      <h2>Goals either side of the half-time interval from Joe Aribo and Alfredo Morelos made for a comfortable win for Rangers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:56:15+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Carson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/callum-carson/</a></address>
      <p>Livingston boss Gary Holt admitted this afternoon's defeat at home to Rangers was 'the toughest day at the office' during his time in charge of the Lions after Rangers eased to three points at the Tony Macaroni Arena.</p>
      <p>The hosts failed to do all that makes them difficult opposition and clinical finishes either side of the break from Joe Aribo and Alfredo Morelos handed Steven Gerrard's the victory.</p>
      <p>But the scoreline could have been more comfortable if not for a spate of missed chances along with some impressive shot-stopping from Livi keeper Matija Sarkic.</p>
      <p>Holt said: "It's probably the toughest day at the office I've had since I've came in. I just think we were more reactive than proactive and waiting for somebody to make something happen and against a very good side like Rangers, you can't do that.</p>
      <p>"I said to them that I can't fault their effort, their energy levels and what they were trying to do but we didn't hunt in packs.</p>
      <p>"We hunted in ones and twos and were passive in certain areas and it's disappointing to see because if you give a really good side time to play, they'll hurt you."</p>

      <p>The Livi boss was handed a boost before kick-off with Lyndon Dykes returning from injury to lead the line but the Aussie ace was well marshaled all game by the Rangers backline, having impressed in the previous two meetings between the sides this term.</p>
      <p>Sarkic was called into action on seven minutes when he pulled off a tremendous one-handed save to tip a deflected Ryan Jack effort from the edge of the box out for a corner-kick.</p>
      <p>Livi’s first chance of the game arrived five minutes later as Dykes sprinted beyond Filip Helander but overcooked his pass top Steve Lawson. The Togo midfielder’s cross from the left-wing was headed comfortably wide by Scott Pittman.</p>
      <p>Much had been made of Livi’s robust style with the two managers engaging in a back and forth in the media prior to the game. And the visitors were screaming for a red card when Jack McMillan went late into Connor Goldson with the left-back being shown a yellow - probably the correct call by referee Nick Walsh.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later Ricki Lamie produced a remarkable tackle to prevent Morelos from opening the scoring. The Colombian made the most of a Jon Guthrie error but delayed pulling the trigger when one-on-one with Sarkic, with Lamie nipping in to dispossess the striker from behind.</p>

      <p>Ryan Kent would then go close with a fizzing drive from 20 yards after some patient build-up play as Livi continued to largely frustrate their opponents.</p>
      <p>There was a sense that a goal might not be long in coming and it duly arrived in the 33rd minute.</p>
      <p>Lamie's tackle on Morelos saw the ball fall kindly for Scott Arfield on the edge of the box. The Canadian international played in Aribo on the left-hand side and he confidently smashed the ball high beyond the helpless Sarkic for the opener.</p>
      <p>The hosts were almost immediately level when Pittman found Dykes in a congested box. The striker chested the ball down before lashing high and wide from 12 yards out.</p>
      <p>The game was effectively over seven minutes into the second half as Morelos made it 2-0 for the visitors as he beat Odoffin before turning inside the defender and stroking a wonderful finish beyond Sarkic and into the far corner.</p>
      <p>While replays would show the Colombian striker was offside, Livi will feel they should have dealt with the situation better.</p>

      <p>The remainder of the contest resembled something of a training match with the Gers in total control but they failed to find a third goal that would have sent them top of the league.</p>
      <p>Sarkic deflected a fizzing Borna Barisic strike on to the woodwork before substitute Greg Stewart squandered a glorious chance in the latter stages when he got in behind Livingston debutant Aaron Taylor-Sinclair but slashed his effort into the side-netting.</p>
      <p>It was a disappointing performance from a Livi side who have now won just once in their last 10 league games, with Holt adding: "I felt Rangers in second and third phases of the game, when the ball fell they were on to it whereas we weren't.</p>

      <p>"We were nowhere near it and it's something that we need to get back to and something we'll have to have a look at as a group because it's okay getting plaudits when it's going well but you learn a lot more from defeats."</p>
      <p>And he insisted there was no hard feelings between himself and his opposite number, commenting: "I said well done to Steven. I always shake hands and wish the opposition the best of games and at the end of the game I'm a big enough boy to accept defeat as well as when we win.</p>
      <p>"I congratulated him on his team's performance and to be fair I think they thoroughly deserved the win today. I can't put up a fight and say there was anything that was naughty or nasty, I just think they were better than us in certain areas and we never caused them any problems."</p>
      <p>He added: "Hopefully he'll have a beer. The door is always open and hopefully he'll come in and I can give him a cuddle."</p>
