      <p>Adding essential oils to your self-care routine is a great way to relieve stress, boost your mood, or even support better sleep. With so many individual essential oil options to choose from, beginners will want to make things as simple as possible. The <a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/02/best-essential-oils-benefits-monq.html">best essential oil starter kits</a> give you an excellent variety and can include anything from pure oils to those that are already blended for you.</p>
      <p>Essential oils are made by extracting the chemical and aromatic essence of plants. Many people believe essential oils have a soothing effect and can contribute to a person's general well-being. There are three ways to use essential oils: inhaling, applying directly to your skin, or ingesting. However, <a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/can-you-ingest-essential-oils/">ingesting essential oils</a> is not recommended without speaking to a healthcare professional first.</p>
      <p>For inhaling, add a few drops to a tissue or dry towel and breath in the scent. Or, you can choose to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-5-best-essential-oil-diffusers-for-large-rooms-8371392">use a diffuser</a>, which breaks down the oils into particles before misting them into the air.</p>
      <p>When applying essential oils to the skin, be sure to dilute it with <a href="https://draxe.com/essential-oils/carrier-oils-for-essential-oils/">a carrier oil</a> first, such as jojoba or grapeseed oil. Or you can also add some drops to your bathwater.</p>
      <p>Essential oil blends are easier for beginners as they were already crafted for a specific purpose, such as making <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-5-best-essential-oils-for-deodorant-18697144">homemade deodorant</a>. You can also use pure oils to create your own combinations. These allow for more versatility, yet may require a little research beforehand.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Note: If you're <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a20707319/how-to-use-essential-oils-safely-during-pregnancy/">pregnant or breastfeeding</a>, be sure to check with a healthcare provider first before investing in essential oils. Some are safer than others.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>The highest quality essential oils are those that are therapeutic grade, which means they are pure, undiluted, and can safely be inhaled or applied to the skin. All the <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/essential-oils-guide-beginners">essential oil starter kits</a> listed here include therapeutic grade oils, giving you the best of the best to choose from.</p>

      <h3>4. A Kit That Takes The Guesswork Out Of Blending</h3>

      </p>
      <p>There are so many recipes for oil blends readily available across the internet these days that it can be confusing and costly for the more novice user to figure out which ones are best for their needs. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078XKPLBR?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19261340-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B078XKPLBR">This essential oil kit</a> comes with 14 pre-blended bottles, thereby doing all the the measurements for you. Among the collection are potions to help <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/9-essential-oils-for-pain-relief-that-actually-work-according-to-science-9114293">ease sore muscles</a>, promote relaxation, boost energy, and relieve headaches. One user in particular points to the "breathe" bottle for its effect on reducing congestion: "I woke up early today with the worst stuffy nose from allergies. Out of desperation I dug out the breathe oil in hopes I would get a little relief. It was amazing. My nose started to clear right up.”</p>
      <p>While these combinations can be inhaled or applied directly to the skin, many reviewers say they work best when added to a a diffuser. Keep in mind, unlike our other picks, these bottles are only 5 milliliter each.</p>
      <p><b>Fans say:</b> "I bought these in conjunction with my 150ml diffuser for my office desk at work. I thought that people would complain about it because I sit in the lobby area of my workplace but there have been non-stop compliments! I've referred several people to this product because they've enjoyed the scents so much. Would definitely purchase again!</p>
      <h3>5. This Best Essential Oil Starter Kit With Diffuser</h3>

      </p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JD2GDKN?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-19261340-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07JD2GDKN">aromatherapy kit</a> is the most expensive pick on the list for good reason— in addition to 10 essential oils, you get a 300 milliliter, BPA-free diffuser, which delivers instant aromatherapy to any room. This oil diffuser is ultrasonic, which means it does't require a filter and has a mist output similar to a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-6-best-humidifiers-for-winter-19217912?">humidifier</a>. It comes in an attractive design, has four timer settings, and features seven ambient light modes (you can choose to cycle through them or just stick to one color). To operate, simply add about six drops of oil (or more if you want an even stronger result) to the tank for an aroma that can last up to eight hours.</p>
      <p>The included 10 milliliter oils are pure with no additives or fillers, so similar to all of the other options above, they have a number of benefits and are not exclusively formulated for diffusers.</p>
      <p><b>Fans say:</b> "I’ve had many diffusers in my life and this one in my favorite! It really does a good job at diffusing the essential oils- and it’s a nice, neutral color. I was hesitant at first, because I didn’t know the quality of oils for this brand, but I’ve been very happy with it so far. Everyone in the office loves to stop by my desk because of this diffuser!"</p>
