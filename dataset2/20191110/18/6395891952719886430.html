      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - Germany's governing parties agreed Sunday to reform the country's pension system, setting aside an ideological dispute that had threatened to unravel the coalition government.</p>
      <p>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the head of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union, said that the parties had found common ground "after long negotiations" on the question of topping up the pensions of low-paid people who have worked for at least 35 years.</p>
      <p>She told reporters in Berlin that recipients would be means-tested for the new basic pension - a key demand of her party.</p>
      <p>Malu Dreyer, interim leader of the center-left Social Democrats, said the agreement would benefit up to 1.5 million retirees, mostly women.</p>
      <p>The deal, which includes a number of other adjustments to the pension system, still needs approval from lawmakers, but party leaders said they were confident of getting support.</p>
      <p>Senior Social Democrats had warned that without a compromise on their key project, it would be difficult to keep the 'grand coalition' going until the next national election scheduled for 2021.</p>
      <p>Dreyer said the pension reforms were a matter that was "close to the heart" of her party, which has been struggling with poor results in recent elections, prompting some to demand that it quit the government early.</p>
      <p>"We have got a major social reform rolling," she said of Sunday's agreement. "That's a good signal to make clear to my party colleagues that without the Social Democrats (in government) this certainly wouldn't have happened."</p>
