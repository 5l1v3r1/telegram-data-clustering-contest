      <h1>Liverpool 3-1 Man City player ratings as Reds extend lead at top of Premier League</h1>
      <h2>Goals from Fabinho, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah secured a stunning victory for Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:23:46+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, Andy Dunn, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool opened up a nine point lead on Manchester City in the first title showdown at Anfield.</p>
      <p>City were furious with Liverpool's opener after Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared to handle in his own area.</p>
      <p>Referee Michael Oliver waved play on and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> broke before Fabinho lashed in from distance.</p>
      <p>Liverpool then had a second on 13 minutes when Andy Robertson whipped in a stunning cross for Mohamed Salah to head in.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane then made it 3-0 early in the second half as he headed in from Jordan Henderson's delivery.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva got one back for City</p>
      <p>Here are complete player ratings from Anfield.</p>

      <h3>Liverpool</h3>
      <p>
        <b>(By Andy Dunn)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alisson 7 - Couple of very decent stops but not exactly overworked</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold 7 - Can claim victory in a great game-long tussle with Sterling</p>
      <p>Van Dijk 7 - Given a stern test but, as usual, passed it with some panache</p>

      <p>Lovren 7 - Defended on the edge but made a couple of crucial blocks</p>
      <p>Robertson 7 - Shaky early on but sensational assist for the second goal</p>
      <p><b>Fabinho 9 MOTM</b> - Will never strike a shot purer than he did for the opener</p>
      <p>Henderson 7 - Had not enjoyed his best passing game until wonder cross for third</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Wijnaldum 7 - Got through a prodigious amount of work in understated fashion</p>
      <p>Salah 8 - Revelled in some unusual freedom and capitalised in style</p>
      <p>Firmino 6 - One of his quieter games but always has an eye for a pass</p>
      <p>Mane 7 - Always a threat and embarrassed the City defence with his header</p>
      <p>
        <b>Subs</b>
      </p>
      <p>Milner 6 (for Henderson, 61)</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Firmino, 79)</p>
      <p>Gomez (for Salah, 87)</p>

      <h3>Man City</h3>
      <p>
        <b>(By John Cross)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bravo 4 - The weakest link. Blameless on first two, but at fault on the third and looked edgy.</p>
      <p>Walker 5 - He was fired up and gave everything in defence and attack. Lost Mane on third goal.</p>
      <p>Stones 6 - The pick of City’s defenders (not saying much) but read danger. Frustrating.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Fernandinho 5 - City miss his influence in midfield and he is not a natural defender. Nightmare.</p>
      <p>Angelino 5 - His attacking play was good, hit the post, but horribly exposed defensively.</p>
      <p>Rodri 5 - Booked. Did not get to grips with the game, Liverpool bypassed him. Disappointing.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne 7 - Wonderful deliveries, took up great positions, drove forward, set up chances for Aguero.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Gündogan 5 - His sloppy clearance set up Fabinho for his pile driver, struggled to make amends.</p>
      <p>Bernardo 7 - Bright start and looked lively but faded. Finally rewarded with a goal for his hard work.</p>
      <p>Sterling 7 - Runs a gauntlet of hate at Anfield, came through it and never, ever gave up.</p>
      <p>Aguero 5 - Wasteful finishing, he missed a hat trick of gilt edged chances. Hooked early.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Subs</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jesus (for Aguero, 71)</p>
