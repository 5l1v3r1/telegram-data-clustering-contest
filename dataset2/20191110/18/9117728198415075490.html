Honda have had a really solid season but will still need to develop if they are to match the power and reliability of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari.</a> </b>

      <p><i>"After our return to Formula 1 in 2015, we had four difficult years. That hurt us a lot,"</i> said Hachigo. <i>"This year we won our first victory at the Austrian Grand Prix. I am really very happy with this result. In Germany, another victory was added, while Kvyat managed to become third there."</i></p>
