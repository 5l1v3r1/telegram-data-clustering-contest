      <h1>France introduces baguette vending machines (but they're not a hit with everyone)</h1>
      <h2>The decline of the bakery in France has led to a gap in the market that is being filled by the baguette machine - but what's it like to get your bread from a machine?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:31:13+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:31</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>The French national institution of the boulangerie has fallen on hard times - and the high-tech solution has split a country.</p>
      <p>The installation of vending machines to distribute the famous baguettes is symbolic of the 'tragic' death of French bakeries, some fear.</p>
      <p>As with high street businesses across the world, changing shopping habits powered by online retailers and out of town supermarkets have left independent bakeries in France desperate for customers.</p>
      <p>As a result many have closed, dooming villages and towns to life without easy-to-access delicious fresh bread.</p>
      <p>Rushing in to fill the gap in the market they've left is an invention seemingly at odds with the long and proud tradition of French bread - the baguette vending machine.</p>

      <p>Rather than a steaming loaf of pain fresh from the oven, many people in France are now slotting a Euro into large metal machines with names such as 'Le Bread Xpress'.</p>
      <p>The machines are stocked with about 100 par-baked loaves of bread produced by local wholesale bakeries.</p>
      <p>Once the customer has made their choice, the machine finishes baking the selected loaf.</p>
      <p>Those lucky enough to be using a machine made by Le Bread Xpress - a brand so French its official logo replaces the 'A' in 'bread' for an Eiffel Tower - can be snacking on a loaf 30 seconds after making the purchase.</p>

      <p>The machines are increasingly common in France, with the brand alone having reached 120 locations as of March this year.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, reaction to the automated bread vendors is mixed.</p>
      <p>"Nice hot crispy crust on on the outside soft on the inside," one person enthused of their Le Bread Xpress loaf.</p>
      <p>"The way bread should be. I bought one on the way out of the mall and nearly at the entire thing before I got home."</p>

      <p>Another pain purchaser was less impresed.</p>
      <p>"Don't waste your money," they wrote online. "Basically microwaved to finish cooking. We threw it out after a few bites."</p>
      <p>Many are equally as unhappy with the decline of the traditional bakery that has led to the machines' rise.</p>
      <p>"Our little village is dying,” said Hélène Collard, whose family has lived in La Chapelle-en-Juger in Normandy for four generations, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/world/europe/france-bakery-closures.html">The New York Times</a> about the closure of the village's last bakery.</p>
      <p>“We’re no longer in contact with the other inhabitants. It was the only meeting point left.”</p>

      <p>Two years ago La Chapelle-en-Juger lost its last bakery in what one newspaper called "un drame" or "a tragedy".</p>
      <p>Others have gone further in describing how things are post-boulangerie.</p>
      <p>“Without bread, there is no more life,” said Gérard Vigot as he stood across the street from the now empty bakery</p>
      <p>"This is a dead village.”</p>
