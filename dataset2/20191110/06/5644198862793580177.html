      <p>MILAN: Wildcard Jannik Sinner completed a dream run when he beat top-seeded Alex de Minaur to win the final of the Next Gen tournament for the season's best Under-21 players on Saturday.</p>
      <p>To the delight of the home crowd, the Italian won 4-2 4-1 4-2 to become the third winner of the tournament after South Korean Chung Hyeon and Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas.</p>

      <p>In a good omen for Sinner, both Tsitsipas and Chung reached the Australian Open semi-finals two months after capturing their titles.</p>
      <p>"The week has been unbelievable," said 18-year-old Sinner. "The crowd... You can hear them now. Iâ€™m very happy... I wouldn't be here without the wildcard, so thanks to everyone. I hope to be back here next year."</p>
      <p>Sinner saved all nine break points he faced while breaking his Australian opponent three times, once in each set.</p>
      <p>His win completed a season which has seen him jump more than 450 spots in the ATP Rankings to his current 95th, making him the youngest player inside the Top 100.</p>
      <p>He also reached his maiden ATP Tour semi-final in Antwerp, scored his first ATP Masters 1000 victory in Rome and qualified for his first Grand Slam at the U.S. Open.</p>
      <p>"Jannik was too good," De Minaur said.</p>
