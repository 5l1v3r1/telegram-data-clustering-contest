      <h1>The Scottish Sports Awards nominees in full as Andy Robertson is in contention for gong</h1>
      <h2>The winners of all the 2019 awards will be announced in Glasgow on December 5.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>The challenge for the judging panel every year is picking winners when there are no losers.</p>
      <p>And in 2019 it has been tougher than ever to whittle down the superstars and success stories you’ve been nominating for the past three months for the 13th annual <i><b>Sunday Mail</b></i> and sportscotland Scottish Sports Awards.</p>
      <p>Our expert panel of judges, featuring internationals from five different disciplines and some of Scottish sport’s most influential figures, spent hours last week coming up with a set of winners who paint the nation’s achievements in the past 12 months in a glorious, golden light.</p>
      <p>And we’re certain that the most glittering night on our sporting calendar, the only official awards night of the national agency for sport, will shine like the medals around our winners’ necks.</p>

      <p>Who will take the big prizes, though? You’ll find out at Glasgow’s Doubletree by Hilton Hotel on December 5 – but for now take your pick from these.</p>
