      <h1>Steven Gerrard maps out Ross Wilson's key Rangers transfer role as he urges recruitment note of caution</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox boss finally got to meet the sporting director this week and was clearly impressed by what he saw.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard can’t say for certain that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-wilson">Ross Wilson</a> will be a success as Rangers’ new sporting director.</p>
      <p>But after finally meeting him in the flesh last week <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> looked in his eyes and saw one thing – HUNGER.</p>
      <p>And that gives the Ibrox gaffer huge encouragement for the future.</p>
      <p>Wilson got his feet under a desk at the Hummel Training Centre after officially starting his new role on November 1.</p>
      <p>There was no fanfare, big unveiling or <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> TV interview. Which is probably how both men would have wanted it.</p>

      <p>Instead, Wilson will now set about the job of enhancing the infrastructure already put in place by his predecessor <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mark-allen">Mark Allen</a> and Gerrard.</p>
      <p>The manager hopes their relationship will blossom over time and he’s been impressed by their early chats.</p>
      <p>But with a manager and supporters who have an insatiable appetite for success, Gerrard believes Wilson’s hunger to improve the club is a good place to start.</p>
      <p>He said: “Certain things have to remain private, like what’s been said between manager and sporting director.</p>
      <p>“But Ross has had a positive week. He’s been welcomed by everyone and is getting used to his new surroundings. We’ve had some interesting meetings and talks already.</p>

      <p>“In terms of his role in the next transfer window, the squad will be made smaller in January.</p>
      <p>“And what doesn’t change at Rangers is that if there’s something worth exploring which will make us better, we’ll try to do it.</p>
      <p>“But don’t expect a lot of bodies coming in – that just won’t be the case.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to predict whether myself and Ross will have a strong relationship. I’ve only known him in person for around 10 days.</p>
      <p>“Before that, we had two or three conversations.</p>
      <p>“Relationships take time to build. I’d never met him previously so it will take time.</p>
      <p>“But I’ve been impressed by what I’ve seen so far. He seems like a really humble guy who is prepared to put in a lot of work.</p>
      <p>“He’ll fit in no problem. As a staff, we have a responsibility to help him. Then relationships begin to build and grow.</p>
      <p>“The important thing is that we all want the same for this club as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>“That’s the first good, strong vibe that I got off Ross – that he’s hungry to improve things and help us grow what we’ve put in place this last 18 months.</p>
      <p>“If you haven’t got that hunger inside you, you shouldn’t be here. I know I’ve got it.</p>
      <p>“We’re working for a hungry set of supporters. You only have to look at the wall inside the training ground with the club’s achievements on it to realise what we’re dealing with here.</p>
      <p>“This club is a beast and you have to be hungry if you want to work for it and represent it.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard has been at pains for the last week to stress that star striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> won’t be sold in the January window.</p>
      <p>He also knows that every player has a price, including the 21 goals in 25 games Colombian.</p>

      <p>It’ll be Wilson’s job to find replacements for Morelos and other top players at Ibrox should they move on.</p>
      <p>But Gerrard’s warning to the new sporting director and, more importantly Dave King’s board, is that it’ll be hugely difficult to replicate their quality.</p>
      <p>He said: “Every new signing is a gamble and the market is especially tough in January.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we don’t want to move on or sell any of our big players in that window.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of things outside of football you need to think about when getting a replacement.</p>
      <p>“Settling in, the language barriers. You have to check what condition they’re in and what type of character they are.</p>
      <p>“So every signing has its risks and availability in January isn’t great anyway.</p>

      <p>“If we’re talking about Alfredo for example, let’s paint a picture of selling him in January.</p>
      <p>“What club out there is going to let you buy a player as good as Morelos? It’s impossible. So it’s not going to happen.</p>
      <p>“We’ve never had a suitable bid for him so there’s no point talking about it.</p>
      <p>“As far as I’m concerned he’s going nowhere and we’ll be watching him for Rangers against Livingston.”</p>
      <p>That’s the come down for Gerrard’s players this weekend – going from an exhilarating win over Porto in front of 50,000 fans to the Tony Macaroni Arena and Livi’s plastic pitch.</p>
      <p>The Rangers boss lost his first game there in September last year and revealed it prompted a unique post-match debrief among his squad.</p>
      <p>Gerrard has won there since but urged his players not to get complacent going to West Lothian this afternoon.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article20008941.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS164181687.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>After revealing that he hopes to have his only injured player, Jordan Jones, back after the international break, he said: “When I think back to my first game at Livi, our performance was an eye-opener.</p>
      <p>“They were very good and strong – they deserved their victory that day.</p>
      <p>“But it showed that if we underestimate any opposition or we’re not ready for the environment we’re going into, we can be found out.</p>
      <p>“So the players learned a lot from that fixture and it was an interesting debrief.</p>
      <p>“Everyone could see quite clearly that we were too passive.</p>
      <p>“And if you do that, you’re normally in a bad mood the day after.</p>
      <p>“We’ve moved forward and made vast improvements in terms of the squad and level of consistency.</p>
      <p>“But we all know what football can do to you. If you get carried away after Thursday night and get complacent, it can come back to bite you.</p>
      <p>“So the challenge is to come down from Porto and get ourselves ready for a tough and very different kind of test.”</p>
