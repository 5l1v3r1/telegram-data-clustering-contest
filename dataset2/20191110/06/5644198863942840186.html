      <p>SEMINYAK, Bali: Each plate of nasi campur is a meticulous art. A warm heap of fluffy white rice takes centre stage, surrounded by small portions of side dishes arranged in a neat and tight circle.</p>
      <p>Vegetable curry, spinach, tempeh, cucumber, beef rendang, prawns and tofu are among the choices ordinarily available for this Balinese dish.</p>

      <p>At Made’s Warung, nasi campur has been its crowd-puller for the last five decades, attracting not just the travellers but also dignitaries the likes of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.</p>
      <p>Its secrets for thriving amid the fierce competition in Bali? Original recipes tried and tested over the years, revealed Mdm Nyoman Reniathi, the senior chef. </p>
      <p>“Also, we use chicken powder as seasoning, unlike some others who rely on artificial food additives,” said the 61-year-old who has been with Made’s Warung for 43 years.</p>
      <p>From its humble beginning as a small food stall, Made’s Warung has grown into a successful establishment with four outlets in Bali and one in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>It has become one of the must-visit eateries on the island of gods, winning over the foreign visitors with authentic Balinese flavours.</p>

        <b>FAMILY-RUN BUSINESS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Made’s Warung is named after its owner Mdm Made Masih.</p>
      <p>Her younger sister Mdm Nyoman Sadihasih said the eatery was first established in 1969 by their parents in Bali’s now-famous touristy area Kuta, which back then was still a little fishing village.</p>

      <p>The restaurant was originally a warung – a small food stall – which only sold Balinese snacks and gado-gado, an Indonesian salad served with peanut sauce dressing.</p>
      <p>“Over time foreigners started to come to Bali. Hippies, people with long hair. They often visited our stall,” Mdm Sadihasih, 62, told CNA.</p>
      <p>Their parents were poor back then and could not afford to hire staff, so everyone in the family had to help out at the warung.</p>
      <p>But it was Mdm Masih, the second of five siblings, who was especially involved in the operations, until tourists started calling the food stall “Made’s Warung”.</p>
      <p>It was also here Mdm Masih met the love of her life, a Dutch businessman who regularly visited the food stall.</p>
      <p>The food stall grew bigger and the family expanded the business to other parts of Bali - Seminyak, currently the biggest branch, Canggu and Bali’s airport - and Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Another outlet will be opened in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta by the end of this year.</p>

      <p>While Mdm Masih takes a back seat these days, Made’s Warung remains a family business.</p>
      <p>Mdm Sadihasih takes care of everything, assisted by the other siblings, their children, as well as loyal staff.</p>
      <p>She is the quality controller ensuring consistency of taste in all outlets. All chefs have to be trained by the family, including the new chef for the Jakarta outlet.</p>

        <b>THE FAMOUS NASI CAMPUR</b>
      </p>
      <p>Over the years, the menu at Made’s Warung evolved from traditional Balinese food to include other Indonesian and Western delights, based on requests from tourists.</p>
      <p>But nasi campur, priced at 95,000 rupiah (US$6.80), has remained the star of the show.</p>
      <p>What sets this Balinese version of nasi campur apart from their counterparts in other corners of Indonesia is the spices used.</p>
      <p>While nasi campur is often served with babi guling (spit-roasted pig) in Hindu-majority Bali, here at Made’s Warung, it also comes with Balinese ayam betutu (roasted chicken) and Balinese bebek betutu (roasted duck). </p>

      <p>Every morning, chefs at the respective outlets will prepare the various side dishes.  </p>
      <p>The variety is a main draw, said Mdm Sadihasih. The wide selection is not only reflected in the menu, but the condiments as well.</p>
      <p>“If someone asks for chili sauce, we have different kinds of sambal here – Balinese sambal matah, fried chili, chili shrimp paste, etc,” she counted off on her fingers.</p>
