      <h1>Logan Paul admits KSI rivalry was fake as third rematch ruled out</h1>
      <h2>Logan Paul claimed his fierce rivalry with KSI was "all for show" and for "selling" after losing their rematch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:13:51+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:13</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Logan Paul claimed his rivalry with KSI was fake and "all for show" immediately after losing their rematch.</p>
      <p>KSI edged a narrow split decision, over a year after their majority draw in Manchester, to settle their long-running feud.</p>
      <p>The pair have traded verbal blows in the build-up but shared an embrace after the result was announced and both spoke of their respect for one another.</p>
      <p>The victorious Brit dismissed any talk of a trilogy by declaring he's "done" and "onto the next thing" - and Paul outlined his respect for his rival which he says was always present despite "selling" the clash with their war of words.</p>

      <p>"I just want to say fair play to JJ," Paul said in the ring after the fight.</p>
      <p>"You're one of the toughest people I know. You've earned everything you've got in life.</p>
      <p>"You had my respect before this. It's all for show, it's all for selling dude.</p>
      <p>"You're one of the toughest people I know and I wish you all the best."</p>

      <p>KSI, meanwhile, thanked Paul for creating an entertaining fight and "making him work".</p>
      <p>He said: "You know what, we've gotta have some respect.</p>
      <p>"It takes a big man to get in the ring and you're a big man.</p>
      <p>"You made me work today and you made me work last year as well.</p>
      <p>"Thank you for a good fight, brother."</p>

      <p>Asked what changed from the first fight, the triumphant KSI said: KSI: "KSI last time was scared. I was scared to fight, I was scared to touch him, I was scared to get close to him.</p>
      <p>"This time I just went in. I just kept going and going.</p>
      <p>"Obviously they saw how much bigger he was, they saw his physique.</p>
      <p>"I constantly just kept going and going. I want to thank my team, who helped me so much.</p>
      <p>"I've done it. I'm victorious."</p>
