      <h1>KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 results: KSI takes split decision win over Logan Paul in controversial fight</h1>

      <p>In a scrappy (and sloppy) fight between two YouTube stars, KSI defeated Logan Paul in their six-round cruiserweight contest, winning by split decision.</p>
      <p>KSI started the fight with more success than he did in comparison to the pairâ€™s first fight, trying to land the big overhand right straight from the first bell, Paul fought the first round with his hands right down, but still had some success of his own landing a good left hook as KSI pushed forward.</p>
      <p>Paul remained relaxed whilst KSI continued to try and land the big overhand. In the third round Paul briefly found himself on the canvas but the referee deemed it a push and not a knockdown, despite replays showing it was a clean punch behind the ear from KSI that landed on Paul.</p>
      <p>In the fourth round, Paul landed a big uppercut that staggered KSI, but as Paul hit KSI on the back of the head as he was going down, referee Jack Reiss deducted Paul of two points but it was still deemed a knockdown.</p>
      <p>Paul began to take control in the fifth round as he started to land his jab for the first time in the fight. KSI seemed to be tiring from his heavy output in the early rounds.</p>
      <p>Just as it seemed Paul was beginning to take control as the fight came to a close, KSI had a second wind in the sixth round and came out swinging again, going back to the overhand right he looked for so often in the first round.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Official result: KSI def. Logan Paul by split decision (55-56, 57-54, 56-55)</b>
