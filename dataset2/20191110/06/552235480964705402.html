      <h1>Lazio heroics proves Celtic can go on another Seville run - Gordon Waddell</h1>
      <h2>They have experience, energy, pace, goals and hunger … the building blocks are all there for them.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>“This team keeps setting new boundaries for itself.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>’s rightly-proud eulogy to his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> team after they won 2-1 in Lazio on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>He deserves, this time, not to have a brick wall put up in front of him while they’re looking for more.</p>
      <p>Cast your mind back to Seville 2003 and the UEFA Cup Final team he played in against Porto. </p>
      <p>Ten of the 11 starters for Martin O’Neill had been at the club for three years or longer. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/henrik-larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> and Paul Lambert had been there for six seasons, Johan Mjallby five, Stan Petrov four.</p>
      <p>The only player with less time served was Bobo Balde and he’d been there two years.</p>
      <p>O’Neill’s team was built. It had foundations and was allowed to settle into the unit it was.</p>

      <p>The unit that beat Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Celta Vigo, Stuttgart and Boavista – not one of them a slouch or a gimme. </p>
      <p>Right now, after watching this Celtic team beat <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> home and away, watching them make the knockouts with two games to spare, looking at its construct?</p>
      <p>There’s not a single reason why they should go into the next stage with the inferiority complex that was so subtle but imbued in them in the past few years. </p>
      <p>They have time-served players, experience, energy, pace, nous, physicality, goals, hunger … the building blocks are all there for them. </p>
      <p>They spent £9million on a striker to elevate them at this level and he has done exactly that.</p>
      <p>They spent £7m on a centre-half who looks like a more towering bargain with every game he plays.</p>

      <p>The guy next to him even more so, maybe. Another £1.6m on a cast-iron full-back who’s so accomplished Lennon himself admits he wondered: ‘What’s the catch…?’</p>
      <p>In the past year they’ve invested heavily in bumper long-term deals for Ryan Christie, James Forrest and Callum McGregor, the latter after refusing all attempts to budge him by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> at Leicester.</p>
      <p>The thing is, though, this isn’t just about this year.</p>
      <p>You can say with near-absolute certainty that unless someone comes in with some stupid money in January, Celtic will be going into the knockout rounds with what they have and maybe a little bit more.</p>
      <p>This is more about the entire M.O. of the club.</p>
      <p>Celtic have always been crystal clear about it. They buy, they develop, they sell. Repeat, ad infinitum.</p>
      <p>In years gone by, the deals signed by the likes of Forrest, Christie and McGregor were never to protect the long-term integrity of the team. They were to make sure they got maximum return when they cashed in.</p>
      <p>Assets have rarely been allowed to walk down Kerrydale Street and drive off down the M74 for free.</p>
      <p>The club have never hidden their business model and how can you argue that it hasn’t worked?</p>

      <p>They’re a paragon of financial stability, reigning treble Treble winners, haven’t lost a domestic cup game in 30.</p>
      <p>They have cash in the bank, bucketloads of it. Peter Lawwell has done them proud in that regard.</p>
      <p>But the last frontier has always been Europe and every time they take a look over that hill?</p>
      <p>They’ve never pushed boundaries, never explored their inner pioneer.</p>
      <p>The last time Lennon built a team that took them to the last 16 of the Champions League and beat Barcelona, its spine was surgically removed within three months of them losing to Juventus.</p>
      <p>Kelvin Wilson, Victor Wanyama, Gary Hooper, right up the middle, were all sold that summer.</p>
      <p>And it was always Lennon’s biggest grumble in his previous reign at the club – he was never given the luxury of living in the house he was trying to build before he had to sell it all.</p>
      <p>Maybe it’s idealistic to imagine it could be different this time. That they’d look at where they could go and say ‘You know what…’</p>
      <p>The problem will come when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> wants a fresh challenge. When Kris Ajer, an incredibly bright boy whose development pathway has been lasered into his head since he was in his mid-teens, wants to move on.</p>
      <p>When someone puts in £30m for your striker and £15m for a centre-half you picked up on a pre-contract.</p>
      <p>Business is business, after all.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>And then the cycle starts again, same as every summer, same as it did the last time. With Lennon wanting to invest early to have a run at the Champions League groups and Lawwell hedging to see if they get there first or not.</p>
      <p>It’s hard not to feel that Lennon merits a reward for proving to all his doubters that THIS is why he’s the Celtic manager again.</p>
      <p>For all those who complained he was the cheap or easy option, a backward step, he has proven them wrong by taking bigger strides away from domestic football than they have at any point in his absence.</p>
      <p>And that’s not just about strategy, it’s about mentality.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>So we know Celtic CAN say no – they did it with McGregor and with Kieran Tierney in the summer of 2018. The question is WILL they?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, despite an equally magnificent result in midweek against another Euro powerhouse, the circumstances at Ibrox couldn’t be more different.</p>
      <p>At some point, and soon, they’re going to have to sell the family silver for their model to resemble anything even remotely sustainable.</p>
      <p>Hanging on to it for the knockout stages, if they get there, and especially if Alfredo Morelos keeps scoring the way he is, could yet be their biggest obstacle in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> may WANT to say no – but CAN they?</p>
