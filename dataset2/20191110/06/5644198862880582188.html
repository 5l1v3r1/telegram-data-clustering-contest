      <p>DUBAI: State-owned Saudi Aramco will sell 0.5per cent of its shares to individual shareholders and the government will have a lockup period of at least six months on further share sales after the initial public offering, its prospectus said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The over 600-page prospectus did not include details of how much of the company would be floated or any commitments from anchor investors.</p>

      <p>Aramco fired the starting gun on the initial public offering (IPO) on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.</p>
