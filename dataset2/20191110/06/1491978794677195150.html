        <i>‘Original thinker’ behind the Rubber Soul and Help! album covers dies aged 82</i>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Freeman, the photographer behind some of the most famous early images of the Beatles, including the cover shots for the albums <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i>,<i> </i><i>Help!</i> and <i>Rubber Soul</i>, has died aged 82.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney">Paul McCartney</a> paid tribute to Freeman by posting a lengthy online tribute, praising him as “one of our favourite photographers who came up with some of our most iconic album covers”. He added: “Besides being a great professional he was imaginative and a true original thinker.”</p>
      <p>Freeman also worked on the final sequences of the first two Beatles films, <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> and <i>Help!</i>, and took the cover photos for the albums <i>With The Beatles</i> and <i>Beatles For Sale</i>.</p>
      <p>McCartney, 77, went on to detail how Freeman had created some of the best-loved pictures of the group: “People often think that the cover shot for <i>Meet The Beatles!</i><i> </i>[US title of <i>With The Beatles</i>] of our foreheads in half shadow was a carefully arranged studio shot,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In fact, it was taken quite quickly by Robert in the corridor of a hotel we were staying in where natural light came from the windows at the end of the corridor. I think it took no more than half an hour to accomplish.”</p>

      <p>The rows of headshots of McCartney, Ringo Starr, George Harrison and John Lennon that appear like film frames on the front of <i>A Hard Day’s Night</i> were taken in Freeman’s London studio. He asked them to make new facial expressions for each photo.</p>
      <p>This weekend, McCartney also described how Freeman came up with the distorted <i>Rubber Soul</i> cover portrait, which appears below the title logo designed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/28/beatles-rubber-soul-illustrator-doodles-viral-twitter">Charles Front</a>.</p>
      <p>“Bob’s normal practice was to use a slide projector and project the photos he’d taken on to a piece of white cardboard, which was exactly album sized, thus giving us an accurate idea of how the finished product would look,” wrote McCartney.</p>
      <p>“During his viewing session the card, which had been propped up on a small table, fell backwards giving the photograph a ‘stretched’ look. Instead of simply putting the card upright again we became excited at the idea of this new version of his photograph.</p>
      <p>“He assured us that it was possible to print it this way and because the album was titled <i>Rubber Soul</i> we felt that the image fitted perfectly.”</p>
      <p>Freeman, born in London and educated at Cambridge, began his photographic career at the <i>Sunday Times </i>and first made an impact with black and white studies of jazz musicians, including the saxophonist John Coltrane. The Beatles’ manager, Brian Epstein, first commissioned Freeman to take a group portrait of the band in 1963.</p>
      <p>Freeman later worked as a director on the cult Swinging London film <i>The Touchables</i> and was also the photographer for the first Pirelli calendar.</p>
      <p>He suffered a severe stroke in 2014 and his family paid for his care and the preservation of his archive by selling a copy of one of his John Lennon portraits.</p>
      <p>Bidding farewell, McCartney wrote: “I will miss this wonderful man, but will always cherish the fond memories I have of him. Thanks Bob. Love Paul.”</p>
