      <h1>Baby Trump balloon slashed at Alabama appearance</h1>

      <p>A giant Baby Trump protest balloon was knifed and deflated by someone unhappy with its appearance during the US president’s trip to Alabama, organisers said.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during President Trump’s visit to watch the University of Alabama football game.</p>
      <p>The balloon, which is more than 20 feet tall, was set up in a nearby park.</p>
      <blockquote>It is rare to get that kind of anger</blockquote>
      <p>Jim Girvan, the organiser of a group that “adopts” out Baby Trump balloons for protests, said a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut an eight-foot-long gash in the back.</p>
      <p>Mr Girvan said the unidentified man was arrested. Tuscaloosa police did not immediately respond to a request for more details.</p>
      <p>The orange, nappy-clad, mobile phone-clutching caricature of the president is often taken to Trump appearances as a way to protest against him.</p>
      <p>Baby Trump first rose over London when local activists brainstormed a way to troll the president. Now several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas around the US.</p>

      <p>Robert Kennedy, a volunteer “baby sitter” who brought the balloon to Tuscaloosa, said the balloon immediately began to sag after it was cut.</p>
      <p>The day had been going mostly smoothly, Mr Kennedy said. Some people yelled “Trump 2020” as they passed while others posed for selfies with the balloon.</p>
      <p>But then Mr Kennedy said a man sidled up on the back of the balloon and attacked it with a knife. He ran away but was caught by police officers, Mr Kennedy added.</p>
      <p>Mr Kennedy said he has accompanied Baby Trump to many appearances and never witnessed an attack on the balloon, although someone did stab a Baby Trump balloon in London earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“It is rare to get that kind of anger,” Mr Kennedy said.</p>
