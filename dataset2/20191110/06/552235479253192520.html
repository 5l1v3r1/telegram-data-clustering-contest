      <h1>Scott Arfield explains where Rangers Euro confidence comes from after Porto win</h1>
      <h2>The 31-year-old admits the whole club expected to beat Porto and admits the strength in depth is a huge factor.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Scott Arfield reckons <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> can now take ANY team in Europe out of their comfort zone when Ibrox springs to life.</p>
      <p>The midfielder played a key role in their 2-0 Europa League win over Porto in midweek that puts Rangers level on points with Group G leaders Young Boys.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard’s</a> men remain unbeaten at home in Europe and Arfield insists the players don’t fear any big gun that might roll into Ibrox.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old said: “Everyone at the club fancied us against Porto.</p>
      <p>“When the big boys roll into town there’s always a great atmosphere at Ibrox. The crowd were waiting for something on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes it just needs a tackle – and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> put one in early. Then you can feel the place come to life.</p>
      <p>“You have to give your all and make it as awkward as possible for the opposition’s technical players.</p>

      <p>“And you saw how many times <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/porto">Porto</a> gave the ball away. Even good players don’t like it when you get after them.</p>
      <p>“It was a massive result. Do teams want to come here now?</p>
      <p>“We can make this an uncomfortable place for anybody to come. The proof is the gaffer’s record in Europe.</p>
      <p>“We’ve made this place our own again and so difficult for visiting teams.</p>
      <p>“The result against Porto, who were in the quarter-finals of the Champions League a year ago, just adds to that.</p>
      <p>“When you consider the calibre of player that turned up for them, we did ourselves proud.</p>
      <p>“We’ve certainly come a long way in the space of 18 months. We reckon we can beat anyone – particularly at home with 50,000 fans waiting to go.</p>
      <p>“Now we have to keep pushing and qualify from the group.”</p>
      <p>Arfield was left out of the starting line up for both Porto games in favour of winger Brandon Barker.</p>
      <p>But when he came on as a sub at Ibrox, Rangers’ performance went up a notch as Alfredo Morelos and Steven Davis grabbed decisive goals.</p>
      <p>The former Burnley man admits he was frustrated to be benched by Gerrard but knows it is a sign of the quality at his manager’s disposal.</p>

      <p>He said: “The gaffer has been around the block a lot longer than me so he knows how I feel.</p>
      <p>“Even in my short career, I’m always going to be disappointed when I don’t play. But we’ve got no problems whatsoever.</p>
      <p>“You can see the competition for places here now. Just look at our bench on Thursday night. There’s a group of players who train in the morning and don’t even make it on to the bench.</p>
      <p>“That’s because we’ve strengthened and it’s why we feel we’re in a really good place at the moment.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people spoke about it last year, didn’t they?</p>
      <p>“As the season went on it caught up with us because we didn’t have that strength in depth.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve certainly got it this season.</p>
      <p>“When you’re left out of the team you have to somehow make an impact.</p>
      <p>“And I think myself, Joe Aribo and Jermain Defoe did that on Thursday night. Everyone wants to play so of course I was disappointed.</p>
      <p>“But it’s about channelling that in the right way so it helps the team.</p>
      <p>“There’s no point moping about the place because we have a big squad.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to play in every game so you have to make sure that when you come on you make an impact.”</p>
      <p>Now Arfield is relishing the chance to grab a starting slot in today’s Premiership clash at Livingston.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “In terms of fitness, I’m buzzing. Football is a wonderful thing and the time when I’m tired, I’ll have problems.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel tired at all. At this club you’re always on a wave of excitement and I can feel it getting even better.”</p>
      <p>As Arfield gets older he doesn’t have to look far for inspiration with the likes of Davis and Defoe around him.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman, now 34, has been impressive this term for Gerrard’s side but Arfield’s not surprised.</p>
      <p>He said: “Davo’s not better than I expected. I’ve played against him so many times and know how good he is.</p>
      <p>“As soon as he walked through the door here I knew he’d take us to a different level.</p>
      <p>“Not just on the pitch but off it as well, the way he conducts himself.</p>
      <p>“The young boys in the dressing-room look up to him and Jermain, the way they live their life.</p>
      <p>“Their body shape is something that men their age don’t normally have!</p>
      <p>“But they’re a credit to themselves and it’s fantastic to have them here.”</p>
