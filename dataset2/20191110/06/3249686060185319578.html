      <p><b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/zico">Zico</a></b> talked about '<b>Show Me the Money</b>'. </p>
      <p>In an interview with <b>Sports World</b>, he started off by joking, "<i>It's all because of my talent</i>" and laughed. He then said, "<i>I'm glad I was able to show a good side of myself as a producer. But I think it's the best never to be a judge again. After Season 6 was over, I told myself that I would never be a judge ever again. I don't think I can help in any cultural way, and thought it was the wisest to just make my own albums.</i>"</p>
      <p>Did you like him as a judge on 'Show Me the Money'?</p>
