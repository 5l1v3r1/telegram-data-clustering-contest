        <i>French youngster regains some leg movement, say family on GoFundMe page</i>
      </p>
      <p>The six-year-old boy seriously injured after allegedly being thrown from the viewing platform of the Tate Modern art gallery in London, is now able to venture outside, his family said.<br/><br/>The child, who is French, cannot be named because of his age. His family said he had regained some movement in his legs as he continued to recover from the fall three months ago.</p>
      <p>In a post on a GoFundMe page, which has raised more than €138,000 (£119,000) to support the boy’s rehabilitation, his family said he was making progress.</p>
      <p>“We would like to share with you some good news of our little knight. He is making lots of progress. We can now bring him outside in a wheelchair to breathe fresh air. It’s tiring for him but he really likes it, of course. He’s smiling and he laughs a lot again. He [has begun] to move his legs, just a tiny little bit but it is really wonderful to see!<br/><br/>“And today, he manages to [give] real kisses. It warms our hearts so much ... Thank you all of you. We hope we will give you other good news as soon as possible.”<br/><br/>Last month, the family revealed the boy had been moved out of intensive care into a rehabilitation centre with an “armour of splints” keeping his limbs in place as he recovered.<br/><br/>Jonty Bravery, 18, has been accused of attempted murder after allegedly throwing the boy from the 10th floor of the London tourist attraction. Bravery, from west London, is due to appear in court for a plea hearing in December.</p>
