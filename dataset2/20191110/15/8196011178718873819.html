      <p>Borris-Ileigh 1-17 - 3-8 Glen Rovers</p>
      <p>Borris-Ileigh booked their place in the Munster club senior hurling championship final at Semple Stadium today. Before an attendance of 2,317, the Tipperary champions held off a second half fightback from Glen Rovers.</p>
      <p>Borris-Ileigh got off to a flying start with joint captain Conor Kenny hitting three quickfire points in as many minutes and when Jerry Kelly found the target, they were in a good position leading four points to no score.</p>
      <p>Glen Rovers, who fielded without the injured Stephen McDonnell, needed a score to settle them, and it came in the form of a brilliant Patrick Horgan goal in the ninth minute, the full forward doubling on a Simon Kennefick pass. Dean Brosnan added a point for the Blackpool side to draw level.</p>
      <p>Borris-Ileigh found another gear and two Kevin Maher frees pushed the advantage out to two points at the beginning of the second quarter. The Glen reply was a Dean Brosnan point but it wasn’t long before the Tipperary champions took control again.</p>
      <p>Points from play courtesy of Conor Kenny and Jerry Kelly got the scoreboard going again, while Kevin Maher and Brendan Maher both scored from placed balls. A Horgan free right close on the 30-minute mark was the sole Glen response, which left the Cork side trailing 1-3 to 0-10 at the interval.</p>

      <p>Borris-Ileigh restarted with a James JD Devaney goal and they moved 10 points clear by the 40th minute. A Horgan goal from a free ignited the Glen challenge and with five minutes remaining they had closed the gap to three points, 2-8 to 1-14.</p>
      <p>Kevin Maher and Conor Kenny put some daylight between the sides but a Mark Dooley goal in stoppage made for a nervous and exciting finish. Kelly’s late, late point ensuring Borris-Ileigh got over the line.</p>
