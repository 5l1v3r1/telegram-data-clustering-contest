      <h1>Man Utd player ratings from Brighton win as Marcus Rashford shines at Old Trafford</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United made light work of Brighton as Andreas Pereira's opener, a Davy Propper own goal and Marcus Rashford's strike sealed a 3-1 win over Brighton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:55:32+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United bounced back from their Bournemouth humiliation last weekend with a comfortable 3-1 Premier League win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday. </p>
      <p>Andreas Pereira opened the scoring after good work from Anthony Martial, with the Brazil international's clipped effort taking a huge deflection off Dale Stephens to leave the helpless Mat Ryan with no chance.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later and United's lead was doubled when another fortunate goal saw Davy Propper bundle into his own net after pressure from Scott McTominay, with VAR causing a huge delay after Harry Maguire was accused of handling the ball in the build up.</p>
      <p>The visitors pulled a goal back in the second half when Lewis Dunk powered home a header but, within two minutes again, United had restored their two-goal lead when Marcus Rashford scored a cracker.</p>

      <p>
        <b>David de Gea 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Little to do between the posts but produced fine reaction save at close-range from Maupay in the second-half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aaron Wan-Bissaka 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Defensively solid and a constant threat down the right going forward. Linked well with James.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Victor Lindelof 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shaky at the start, losing possession cheaply, but improved thereafter and rarely troubled.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Harry Maguire 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>United's skipper led by example. Strong in the air, anticipated danger and assured bringing the ball out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Brandon Williams 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Strong and committed throughout on first Premier League start. Denied a goal by Ryan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scott McTominay 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looked to have bundled ball over the line to make it 2-0, although given as an own goal.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Fred 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Snapped into tackles early on and made some key interceptions. Growing in influence.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Andreas Pereira 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>His deflected shot opened the scoring for United after 17 minutes after key role in build-up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Daniel James 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Work-rate as impressive as his threat going forward. Denied goal on his birthday by Ryan.</p>

        <b>Marcus Rashford 9 MOTM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scored United's third off underside of bar, then missed open goal moments later. Booked.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Anthony Martial 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Showed great persistence and awareness to set up Rashford for United's third goal.</p>
