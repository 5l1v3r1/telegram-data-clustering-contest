      <p>Ballygunner 0-17 - 0-9 Patrickswell</p>
      <p>Ballygunner eased past Patrickswell to book their place in the Munster club final with 1,967 spectators seeing them prevail in a chilly Walsh Park.</p>
      <p>Both sides struggled to find their range early on, with Ballygunner’s Pauric Mahony (free) the only scorer in the opening ten minutes.</p>
      <p>Dessie Hutchinson added two quick points for the home side, whose experienced half-backs were the dominant line on the field. Hutchinson came close to a goal on 13 minutes but added another point soon after - 0-4 to no score at the end of the first quarter.</p>
      <p>An Aaron Gillane free finally opened the ‘Well account on 20 minutes, with Mahony responding in kind and Hutchinson hitting another sweet point.</p>
      <p>Diarmaid Byrnes’ long-range free and a good Gillane point made it 0-6 to 0-3 on 26 minutes, but Mahony snapped over a point in answer.</p>
      <p>Patrickswell narrowed the gap with Gillane and John Flynn points, and one more Gillane free in injury-time made it 0-7 to 0-6 at half-time.</p>
      <p>Michael Mahony resumed with a Ballygunner point and then took over, the midfielder stretching the Gunners’ lead with three more points from play - 0-11 to 0-6 they led on 43 minutes.</p>

      <p>Gillane eventually opened the ‘Well account with a free on 44 minutes but Peter Hogan responded. Much like the first half, Ballygunner were in control: Barry O’Sullivan put six between them on 50 minutes, 0-13 to 0-7.</p>
      <p>Pauric Mahony (free) and Shane O’Sullivan pushed the home side further in front; Jack Kelleher had Patrickswell’s second point of the half but six minutes left, but the Gunners led 0-15 to 0-8 and saw out the rest of the game with ease.</p>
