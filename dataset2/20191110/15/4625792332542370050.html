      <p>Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar drew sharp criticism for a message she shared on Twitter in response to the news that businessman Leon Cooperman plans to support billionaire Michael Bloomberg's potential run for president.</p>
      <p>"I wonder why?" Omar tweeted Saturday in response to the news along with a "thinking" emoji.</p>

      <p>Her response caused many to assert that she linked Cooperman to Bloomberg because both men are Jewish. Omar, a Muslim, has been under fire several times since being elected to Congress for making remarks considered by many to be anti-Semitic, including a February tweet in which she suggested lawmakers supported Israel only for the money.</p>
      <p>"Itâ€™s all about the Benjamins baby," <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ilhan-omar-claims-she-had-no-idea-she-was-being-anti-semitic">she said of congressional support for Israel</a>.</p>
      <p>Among many others, former tennis star Martina Navratilova, who supports President Trump, condemned Omar's comment, writing, "This is a wrong thing to say Congresswoman..."</p>

      <p>Omar, 37, has been under criticism for advocating for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions of Israel. Both herself and fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib from Michigan <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/israel-poised-to-block-omar-and-tlaib-from-visiting">were blocked from entering the country</a> earlier this year for their stance on the BDS movement.</p>
      <p>Omar, a refugee from Somalia, has consistently denied accusations that she is anti-Semitic. On Saturday night, she reacted to the backlash by simply tweeting, "Yep," in response to several tweets defending her and calling the criticism the "latest effort to twist" her words.</p>
