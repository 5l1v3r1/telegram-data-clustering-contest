      <h2>The Manchester City first-team squad arrived at Anfield ahead of their mouthwatering Premier League showdown with title rivals Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:38:44+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City's stars received a hostile reception from Liverpool fans as they arrived at Anfield for their crunch top-of-the-table Premier League clash on Sunday.</p>
      <p>As expected, Reds supporters turned up in numbers to greet Jurgen Klopp's title chasers - and also ensured that Pep Guardiola's side were given a frosty welcome.</p>
      <p>As City's team bus made its way through the crowd and towards the stadium entrance, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> fans set off red smoke bombs and booed their rivals.</p>
      <p>Despite the hostility, the incident appeared to play out without any major drama, which will be a relief to City chiefs who feared another violent attack on their team bus.</p>

      <p>City’s bus was pelted by objects, including cans, bottles and flares, as the vehicle made its way through crowds of Liverpool fans to Anfield for a Champions League tie 19 months ago.</p>
      <p>The coach windscreen was smashed and damage to the vehicle so severe a replacement vehicle had to be drafted in to take the City squad back to Manchester after their 3-0 defeat.</p>
      <p>Ahead of this potentially title-race defining game, senior figures from City sought assurances from their Liverpool counterparts that there would be no repeat of the coach attack.</p>

      <p>City were furious no culprits were identified for their part in the coach attack, despite widespread video footage of the prolonged attack being made available to Merseyside Police.</p>
      <p>Liverpool issued an unreserved public apology for the attack, which was also condemned by boss Jurgen Klopp, and saw the club fined £17,600 by UEFA.</p>
      <p>Merseyside Police came in for criticism for making public the route City’s bus was taking that day, leading to claims that ultimately helped fans plan the coordinated attack in advance.</p>

      <p>Police did not publicise the route City’s bus took this time, while officers spoke to fan groups about social media posts urging another hostile welcome for their opponents.</p>
      <p>The rivalry between City and Liverpool has become increasingly bitter in recent seasons, with both teams going head-to-head for the title and clashing on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Both managers have fuelled the animosity in the build-up to the showdown, with Pep Guardiola branding Sadio Mane a diver and Klopp accusing the City boss of being too preoccupied with Liverpool, as well as throwing in a jibe about City’s perceived “tactical fouls”.</p>
