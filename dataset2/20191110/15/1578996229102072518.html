      <h1>Why Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton Stood On Different Balconies For Remembrance Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:01:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author">Erika Harwood</a></address>
      <p>On Sunday morning, members of the royal family gathered for the Remembrance Day at Whitehall. The family observed a two-minute moment of silence and laid a wreath in honor or the men and women who died serving their country. In a rare moment of emotion, the Queen <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/remembrance-day-queen-wipes-tear-20852978">wiped a tear</a> from her eye as she stood next to Kate Middleton and Camilla Parker-Bowles.</p>
      <p>Meghan Markle stood on a different balcony than the Queen, though that’s not unusual. Members of the royal family stand in groups <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111080350/meghan-markle-separate-balcony-kate-middleton-remembrance-sunday/">according to precedence</a>. In years past, Prince Philip stood next to the Queen, but Kate has taken his place for the past two years.</p>
      <p>The royal family has been participating in multiple events to honor Remembrance Day, and it marks the first time Harry and Meghan have attended an event with William and Kate since June’s Trooping the Colour.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Tom Bradby, Harry addressed rumors of a rift between he and his older brother saying they have their good days and their bad days.</p>
      <p>“We are brothers. We will always be brothers,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50128683">he said</a>. “We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him as I know he will always be there for me.”</p>
      <p>William was reportedly “worried” about Harry after the interview came out, while Kate is just hoping that they’ll be able to mend their issues with time.</p>
      <p>“While Kate’s concerned about Harry and Meghan’s wellbeing, she tries to stay out of the drama,” <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29746620/prince-harry-meghan-markle-prince-william-kate-middleton-first-joint-appearance-since-june/">a source said</a>. “She hopes William and Harry will eventually heal the rift and let bygones be bygones.”</p>
