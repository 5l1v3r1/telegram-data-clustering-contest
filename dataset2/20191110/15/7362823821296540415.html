      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/sarah-hyland">Sarah Hyland,</a> 28, has decided to remove a regrettable tattoo from her backside.</p>
      <p>The “Modern Family” actress recently shared footage of herself at the doctor’s office, lying on her stomach while wearing protective goggles.</p>
      <p>“Actual reaction to some laser tattoo removal,” she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sarahhyland/">captioned the Instagram clip.</a> “Oof…that hurt. Spicy,” she said, while grimacing in pain.</p>

      <p>Based on where the doctor was standing, it appears Hyland had the purple dinosaur tat on her butt removed. The actress also has a tattoo of an arrow between her shoulder blades.</p>
      <p>The dino tattoo matches that of bestie Katie Welch, both of whom shared photos of their matching ink while rocking bikinis poolside in 2017.</p>
