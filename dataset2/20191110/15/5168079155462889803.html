      <p>Winter is around the corner, and a new season demands a whole new look. We teamed up with Zeinab Al Saeed, the owner and founder of Oohlala, and Natasha Martin, the makeup artist at Oohlala, to take us through to achieving the most trending party look for the season.<br/><br/><b>Ampoules</b>: These highly-concentrated, supercharged serums that are popularly called ampoules are the new favourites in the beauty and skincare industry. We used one for brightening the skin and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. For those who haven’t used serums earlier, know that a slight tingle is normal; it only means the serum is penetrating the skin and working its magic.<br/><br/><b>Primer:</b> Though the serum will help to moisturise the face, it is also a good idea to use a hydrating primer before applying anything else.<br/><br/><b>Eyebrows: </b>Brush off any strays and use a little concealer along the brow lines. This helps to define the eyebrows and give it those smooth lines. Instead of using a black eyebrow pencil, opt for a gel in a deeper brown to make the brows look more natural.</p>
      <p><b>Eyeshadow:</b> Start with the eyes first so that any fallout can be tackled later. Using a little concealer before applying the shadow is a good trick to make any colour layered on top pop out better. To achieve the bold eyes, we went for a vibrant pink shade and transitioned to a deep purple for the upper eyelids. To enhance the purple, we used a pigmented, glitter eyeshadow in the same colour. If you love smoky eyes but are bored of using the usual blues, grays, or blacks, purple is the perfect alternative.<br/><br/><b>Lashes:</b> Apply a thin coat of mascara before sticking on the lashes. We opted for a pair of voluminous lashes and added a thin liner along the lash line to further define the eyes and help the heavy lashes stick better.</p>

      <p><b>Colour correction: </b>Colour correction is an essential step to achieve a flawless look. Determine your skin undertones and use a colour corrector that works to balance that particular undertone. We went for yellow to suit my skin undertone. Always remember to blend the corrector in properly else it’ll leave your skin looking patchy.<br/><br/><b>Foundation: </b>Go for a foundation that is closest to the colour of your skin and ensure you apply it on the neck, ears, and sides of your face equally well.<br/><br/><b>Under-eye concealer:</b> A common mistake is applying a layer of foundation under the eyes too. Doing this can make the area look cakey, and eventually, it ends up with those ugly crease lines we all despise. In the long run, it can also darken the area under the eye. Remember that the skin under the eyes is a lot thinner than the other parts of your face and should be dealt with differently. Instead of foundation, stick to a concealer only.<br/><br/><b>Powder: </b>Seal the makeup with some loose powder.<br/><br/><b>Lower lash line:</b> Add a pop of colour below your lower lash line to brighten up the eyes. We used a bright blue that perfectly complements the purple. To enhance your peepers, apply mascara to the lower lashes too.<br/><br/><b>Bronzer, blush, and highlighter:</b> Dust bronzer lightly and brush some peach blush to give your skin the lovely sun-kissed glow. Dabbing on a little highlighter along the cheekbones will give the skin a touch of radiance for that subtle dewy look.<br/><br/><b>Lips:</b> Nude lips with a hint of gloss (no matte finishes here) are a favourite when it comes to this look. It’s also always a good idea to opt for subtle lip colours when sporting dramatic eyes to maintain that delicate balance and not look too overpowering.<br/><br/><i><b>Antara Bose is a model turned fashion and beauty consultant.
