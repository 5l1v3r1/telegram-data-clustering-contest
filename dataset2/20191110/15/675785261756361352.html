      <h1>Man Utd 3-1 Brighton: 5 talking points as Marcus Rashford continues scoring spree</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United boosted their top-four hopes with a comfortable victory at Old Trafford. Andreas Pereira set the Red Devils on their way with an early opener</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:55:40+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United moved up to seventh place in the Premier League after a comfortable win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Andreas Pereira opened the scoring after his left-footed effort from inside the box took a big deflection off Dale Stephens to wrong foot Matt Ryan in the Brighton goal.</p>
      <p>Just two minutes later United doubled their lead as Davy Propper bundled the ball into his own net following pressure from Scott McTominay after Harry Maguire had headed on from a free-kick.</p>
      <p>Lewis Dunk gave Brighton hope after powering in a header from a corner after 64 minutes.</p>
      <p>But just moments later Marcus Rashford sealed the win with a strike that went in off the underside of the crossbar, although there was still time for him to miss an absolute sitter after Daniel James put the ball on the plate for him with the goal gaping</p>
      <p>Here are five talking points from Sunday’s encounter…</p>

      <h3>Williams impresses on Premier League debut</h3>
      <p>Brandon Williams became only the second United player born after the year 2000 to play in the Premier League, but he looked far more senior than his 19 years would have you believe.</p>
      <p>After holding his own in the Europa League and Carabao Cup Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put his faith in the local lad for today’s game, and the academy graduate didn’t let him down.</p>
      <p>He seemed to grow in confidence after making an early tackle by the corner flag which had the Old Trafford faithful roaring their approval, and although he didn’t offer huge amounts going forward, he was solid defensively throughout.</p>
      <p>He was, however, perhaps lucky to stay on the pitch after an over-enthusiastic high challenge in the second-half that on another day could have seen him given his marching orders rather than receiving just a yellow.</p>
      <p>With Ashley Young ageing and Luke Shaw in and out of the side with injuries there is a real chance for Williams to make that left-back position his own.</p>
      <p>On this showing there is every chance he could do just that.</p>

      <h3>Feel-good factor returning at Old Trafford</h3>
      <p>With the sun shining and two early nerve-settling goals scored, the United fans were in a pretty jovial mood throughout this encounter, and their team finally played the sort of free-flowing, attacking football that we know they are capable of.</p>
      <p>Yes, they are still miles off bitter rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in terms of quality, but their supporters will be able to sit back and relax watching Sunday evening’s top-of-the-table clash between their two dearest enemies with a satisfied feeling about how their side played in an entertaining encounter.</p>
      <p>Since their dreadful performance in the 1-0 loss against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> in October United have won five and drawn with Liverpool, with last weekend’s disappointing defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> the only slip-up.</p>
      <p>The fixture list looks fairly kind going into the Christmas period, and there is now a real feeling Solskjaer’s team could put a good run together and get back to challenging for those top four places.</p>
      <p>With pressure mounting on the likes of Unai Emery and Mauricio Pochettino much of the heat has been taken off Solskjaer, and the Norwegian will probably feel more secure at the moment than at any other point in the season so far.</p>

      <h3>Fred showing signs of improvement</h3>
      <p>The much-maligned Fred has been the target of frustration from United fans after so far failing to live up to expectations following his big-money move from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, he was solid in the middle of the park, doing his job with minimal fuss and regularly winning the ball and breaking up Brighton attacks. He even almost scored in the second half, with a rasping long range shot which Matt Ryan tipped onto the bar.</p>
      <p>Yes, Brighton didn’t offer much, and he needs to start doing the business in bigger games to start to justify his £52m transfer fee, but this was certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

      <h3>Pereira scores morale-boosting goal</h3>
      <p>Another man who has often flattered to deceive in a United shirt is Pereira, but his goal should do him a world of good as he attempts to prove his worth at the highest level.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian midfielder is a strange player- he so often shows flashes of brilliance, but then goes on to choose the wrong option or dawdle on the ball just that bit too long.</p>
      <p>At 23 years old he is relatively young, and he still has the potential to become a top class player, but his decision-making has to improve rapidly if he is to keep his place in the lineup.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that slightly fortunate 17minute goal could be just what he needs to kick-start his somewhat unpredictable career, and his standing ovation as he was substituted in the second half shows United’s fans are still very much behind him.</p>

      <h3>Brighton with little to worry about</h3>
      <p>Brighton’s away record against the traditional top-six sides is woeful to say the least- they have now lost 14 out of the 15 they have played since being promoted to the top-flight.</p>
      <p>They weren’t great today, and although Dunk’s headed goal did show that they can be a threat from set-pieces, they really lack something going forward.</p>
      <p>There is always a worry that a club the size of Brighton will get sucked into a relegation dogfight, but followers of the Seagulls shouldn’t get too worried just yet.</p>
      <p>They still sit a healthy eight points clear of the drop zone, and should have enough to stay clear of the bottom three.</p>
      <p>Graham Potter could do with investing in an attacking threat in January, as they are over-reliant on youngster Aaron Connolly and the hot-and-cold Neal Maupay, but there are certainly at least three Premier League teams weaker than them.</p>
