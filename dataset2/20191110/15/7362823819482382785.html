      <h1>Wisconsin man gets third DWI after allegedly driving drunk with a live chicken on his shoulder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:34:07+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">David Aaro</a></address>
      <p>Oak Creek police arrested a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> man on Sunday for allegedly<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime"> driving runk</a> with a live chicken on his shoulder.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Martinez-Garnica, 42, from Milwaukee, was cited for drunken driving after a witness saw him "driving really reckless" and his car "swerving all over the road" on Howell Avenue -- with what they originally believed to be a hawk on his shoulder, according to the police report.</p>
      <p>“There’s a guy behind us. … He’s driving really reckless, but he has a hawk in his car,” a 911 caller said, according to <a href="https://myfox8.com/2019/11/08/man-accused-of-driving-drunk-with-a-live-chicken/">Fox 8 WGHP</a>.</p>

      <p>When police caught up with the vehicle they noticed a bird flapping inside. After a closer look, they saw it was a brown chicken, not a hawk, that the suspect decided to bring along for the ride.</p>
      <p>Police searched the vehicle and found numerous beer cans and noticed "a live chicken that was fluttering around the inside of the vehicle," the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Martinez-Garnica was given a field sobriety test, which he failed -- netting him his third DWI arrest.</p>

      <p>The chicken, named "Teresa," was placed in the back of the police vehicle with the driver's cousin -- who had also been riding in Martinez-Garnica's car.</p>
      <p>Police say Teresa is safe. She was given to the Milwaukee Area Domestic Animal Control Commission, where she's being kept until the owner claims it, according to Fox 8.</p>
