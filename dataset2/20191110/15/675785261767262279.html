      <h1>Outrage after vandals spray paint cars with swastikas on Remembrance Sunday</h1>
      <h2>The disturbing graffiti was discovered in the Ferrymead area of Canvey Island, Essex - an area known for its Jewish links</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:09:35+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author">Brendan McFadden, Joe Davies</a></address>
      <p>Shocked residents in a community known for its Jewish links woke today on Remembrance Day to find sick vandals had spray painted cars and garages with swastikas and antisemitic messages.</p>
      <p>The disturbing graffiti, which included phallic symbols, was discovered in Canvey Island, Essex, an area that is though to be home to around 60 orthodox Jewish families.</p>
      <p>It is believed to have been painted late last night and in the early hours of the morning, <a href="https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/canvey-residents-shocked-cars-branded-3521648">Essex Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>Holly Roache, who lives on Ferrymead, took a photo of her neighbour's car which was subjected to vandalism.</p>
      <p>She said: "There’s a car at the entrance of our road that’s been targeted and also in other areas."</p>

      <p>The swastika is a symbol of white supremacy and was the icon of Hitler's Nazi Party in Germany during WW2, to symbolise German nationalistic pride.</p>
      <p>An Essex Police spokesperson said: "We are investigating after several reports of criminal damage to cars in Ferrymead, Canvey Island overnight.</p>
      <p>"We were called this morning, Sunday 10 November, to reports that vehicles had been sprayed with racist and anti-Semitic graffiti.</p>

      <p>"If you have not yet spoken to us about damage to your vehicle please call 101 and quote incident number 307 of today's date."</p>
      <p>Many Jewish people moved to Canvey Island in search of a new life and cheaper housing, according to The Guardian.</p>
      <p>The Queen joined senior royals and politicians to honour the war dead this morning at a service at the Cenotaph memorial on Whitehall in London.</p>
      <p>It was among hundreds of ceremonies held across the country to remember the war dead.</p>
