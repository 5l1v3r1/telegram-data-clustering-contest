      <h1>Steven Gerrard gives curt Gary Holt response before Rangers face Livingston</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox boss didn't seem entirely happy with his counterpart in wake of his stinging comments in the Sunday Mail.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:29:03+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has issued a stark riposte to furious comments from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Gary Holt</a> accusing the Ibrox boss of "naivety" before today's match with Livingston.</p>
      <p>Speaking to sister title <i><b>The Sunday Mail</b> </i>, Holt blasted back at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> for highlighting the need for protection from referee Nick Walsh in today's Premiership clash.</p>
      <p>The last game between the two clubs in West Lothian was marred by a collision between Ricki Lamie and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/joe-aribo">Joe Aribo</a> that left the silky Nigerian international with 20 stitches.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The Rangers manager also noted the number of aerial challenges that resulted in head knocks during the game.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sky, Gerrard said: "It's about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> players and Rangers players and which team carries out the gameplan and tactics to the best of their ability.</p>
      <p>"I don't think it's anything to do with me and Gary Holt but if he wants to talk about it after the game we can do."</p>
