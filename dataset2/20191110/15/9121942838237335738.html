      <p>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) — Chennedy Carter scored 25 points and No. 6 Texas A&amp;M beat Duke 79-58 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Aggies outrebounded the Blue Devils 47-26, despite Duke holding a nearly three-inch average height advantage over Texas A&amp;M. Along those lines the Aggies also dominated the Blue Devils inside in outscoring Duke 38-26 in points in the paint.</p>
      <p>Haley Gorecki led Duke with 16 points, and Ciera Johnson added 14 points for the Aggies. Johnson and teammate N’dea Jones each grabbed 12 rebounds. The Blue Devils had 13 steals and the Aggies committed 22 turnovers, their biggest cause for concern early in the season.</p>
      <p>The Aggies have won three consecutive games against the Blue Devils, and Duke fell to 0-4 in games in College Station. The Blue Devils now have lost 10 consecutive games to ranked opponents.</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M was coming off a 93-63 loss to the USA National Team in an exhibition game in Reed Arena on Thursday night. Duke defeated High Point 93-57 on Tuesday to start its season.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Texas A&amp;M: The Aggies usually play a tough nonconference schedule under longtime coach Gary Blair, and although Duke is unranked to start the season the Blue Devils gave the Aggies fits for nearly three quarters. That kind of experience against a typically tough ACC foe should serve the Aggies well entering SEC play in early January.</p>
      <p>Duke: Despite the setback the Blue Devils, receiving votes in the AP poll, hung around until late in the third quarter, trailing 41-36 with seven minutes remaining in the third, a confidence boost for a team needing it. Duke, with all five starters back from last year, is trying to make amends for its 6-10 showing in ACC play last season.</p>
