      <p>Ernesto Valverde hailed Lionel Messi once more after his hat-trick helped Barca sink Celta 4-1.</p>
      <p>"With Messi anything is possible and I would be lying if I told you that when he takes a free-kick I don't expect it to be a goal," said Valverde.</p>
      <p>"With him the chances are much higher and when I saw the position of the two free-kicks, I did think they would be goals. It's something that he's mastered perfectly and we know that the opponents always try not to commit fouls in front of the box. That's something we take advantage of."</p>
      <p>The coach added: "It's impossible not to depend on Messi. He's got a decisive influence in our attackand we don't have to give that up, because it's an advantage that we have and opponents fear. If he played for another team they'd rely on him too, because he dominates everything. Apart from scoring the goals he is deeply involved in the play and when he sees that it's not flowing he takes the responsibility for coming deeper and unblocking the game. That's something he interprets perfectly."</p>
