      <p>CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) — The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline has remained steady over the past two weeks with a .30 cents per gallon (3.8 liters) rise to $2.69.</p>
      <p>Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey says Sunday there may be a price drop soon as maintenance at refineries continues and consumers cut back demand this time of year.</p>

      <p>The highest average price in the nation for regular-grade gas is $4.09 per gallon in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>The lowest average is $2.08 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>
      <p>The average price of diesel is $3.08, down 2 cents since October 25.</p>
