      <h1>French Official Charged with Drugging 200+ Women to Make Them Urinate</h1>
      <h2>A senior official in the French Ministry of Culture has been charged with drugging over 200 women with diuretics so that he could take pictures and watch while they urinated.</h2>

      <p>The French newspaper <i>Libération</i> <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/amphtml/france/2019/11/07/au-ministere-de-la-culture-les-entretiens-pervers-d-un-haut-fonctionnaire_1762196?__twitter_impression=true">reports</a> that during job interviews at the ministry, the official would offer the women either coffee or tea, and after a few minutes the pervert would return with a drink spiked with Furosemide, a powerful diuretic known as a “water pill” because of its ability to produce more urine in the body.</p>
      <p>He would then take the women on a tour of historic sites in Paris around the Ministry of Culture, telling the women that it was important to know the sites if they were to work in the ministry.</p>
      <p>When the women were struck with the uncontrollable urge to urinate, the official would offer to shield them with his coat as they relieved themselves on the ground.</p>
      <p>One of the victims told <i>Libération</i>: “I urinated on the floor, almost at his feet. I was humiliated and ashamed.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “I felt my belly swell, I was on the edge of discomfort. Under a bridge, I lowered my trousers and panties and urinated. Meanwhile, he was holding his coat in front of me to hide me and looking at my face.”</p>

      <p>The official is said to have kept meticulous records of each incident in an excel spreadsheet, in one instance he recorded: “Start time 9:00 a.m. Event time 9:55 a.m.. Time of application 10:00 a.m. Time of release 10:10 a.m. She lowers her pants even before I protect her. Long enough, I offer her a paper, she wipes herself standing right in front of me. ”</p>
      <p>In another case, he wrote: “She begins to drop pantyhose and panties (black). She squats and drops a jet very strong and very long.”</p>
      <p>One of the women was admitted to the hospital for four days with a urinary tract infection.</p>
      <p>The man conducted his perverted scheme on over 200 women between 2009 and 2018. He was finally caught after a woman reported to his superiors for taking pictures of her legs under his desk.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Culture <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50354918">denied</a> knowing about the activities of the official; however <i>Libération</i> reports that at least two women had filed complaints about the man.</p>
      <p>The official has since been sacked and is under investigation by the police for sexual and for the administration of a harmful substance.</p>
