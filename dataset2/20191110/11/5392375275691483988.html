      <p>Since 2017, Apple has abandoned the Touch ID on its iPhones, and in 2020 there are many innovations that enthusiasts dream of seeing next year. Among these, the great return of the fingerprint reader, integrated in the display to support the Face ID. Well, it appears that the Cupertino company is seriously thinking about an in-display Touch ID and not just for iPhones.</p>
      <p>A patent filed by Apple in May 2018, shows in fact a futuristic smartwatch by the Californian giant. With some peculiarities still unrevealed. Above all, it will have a fingerprint reader integrated into the display. Which would allow the future Apple Watch to unlock itself.</p>
