      <p>SHANGHAI, Nov 10 — Kento Momota won his 10<sup>th</sup> title of a remarkable year as Japan’s world number one defeated Chou Tien-chen to retain his Fuzhou China Open crown today.</p>
      <p>Home hope Chen Yufei similarly successfully defended the women’s title with a gritty victory over Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara.</p>
      <p>Reigning two-time world champion Momota battled past Taiwan’s world number two Chou 21-15, 17-21, 21-18 in a repeat of last year’s final.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Chou is in the unusual position of not having a coach and instead relies on his longtime physio to guide him courtside during matches.</p>
      <p>Chou saved one match point but handed Momota the title by hitting into the net. The Japanese player fell onto his back and screamed in celebration, his fists clenched.</p>
      <p>The peerless Momota, 25, has had another hugely successful year, his haul of titles in 2019 including another world crown and the prestigious All England Open.</p>
      <p>The women’s final was a similarly gruelling affair and likewise went to three games.</p>
      <p>China’s Chen lost the first game 21-9 to Okuhara but recovered to lift the Fuzhou title for the second year in a row by winning the next two 21-12, 21-18.</p>
      <p>It was more disappointment for Okuhara, who has now lost all six finals she has contested this year. — AFP</p>
