      <h3>NATIONAL Capital Region Police Office director Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas yesterday led the send-off ceremony for 368 members of the NCRPO Regional Mobile Force Battalion (NCRPO-RMFB) sent to help beefup security at the New Bilibid Prisons.</h3>
      <p>In his talk to his men, the NCRPO chief emphasized certain norms and guidelines they have to strictly follow as they guard the critical areas of NBP particularly its Maximum Security Compound which houses a number of jailed drug lords and other notorious convicted criminals.</p>
      <p>Sinas instructed them to strictly comply with the prohibition on the carrying of cell phones, any electronic gadgets and jewelry during their tour of duty at the NBP.</p>
      <p>The official said the 368 should also wear their proper uniforms as prescribed in the PNP Letter of Instruction “Tamang Bihis”.</p>
      <p>Sinas said the NCRPO-RMFB men will be assigned to a 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. shifts in the NBP only. All will be under the management and supervision of the Bureau of Corrections upon entering the BuCor premises and thus, must act in accordance with the BuCor’s policy.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, the official said that all augmented personnel are obliged not to communicate nor engage in any way with the inmates unless needed.</p>
      <p>“Sana gumanda ang ating trabaho upang gumanda ang tingin nila sa atin,” Sinas said as he expressed high hope that the fresh NCRPO faces at the NBP will doing their job with all efficiency and honesty.</p>
      <p>The official also said that he won’t hesitate to pull out any NCRPO personnel assigned to the NBP in the event they are accused of committing irregularities.   “I talked to the BuCor. Sabi ko kung later on, the police becomes the problem, siya ang bine-blame, he becomes the problem, we better pull out the police,” he said.</p>
      <p>Fourteen NCRPO members were recently investigated for allegedly trying to smuggle mobile phones inside the NBP compound. However, they were found “innocent” after the 14 cell phones seized from them were really their personal phones and obviously are not meant for prisoners’ use.</p>
