      <p>Environment Agency officials have today issued flood alerts for parts of the Midlands.</p>
      <p>They have warned of flooding in Tamworth, Solihull and Studley after torrential downpours.</p>
      <p>The Government agency says flooding is possible on the Bourne Brook at Tamworth where river levels have risen "as a result of persistent heavy rainfall overnight."</p>

      <p>Flooding of roads and farmland is possible from Sunday morning, it says, and is already affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the Bourne Brook.</p>
      <p>No further rainfall is forecast today but river levels are expected to remain high into Monday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Staff are closely monitoring the river levels and forecasts and have urged people to avoid roads, footpaths and bridges near local watercourses.</p>
      <p>Another alert is in place for the River Blythe in Solihull borough, where there has also been heavy rain.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Flooding is already affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the river between Cheswick Green and Blyth End.</p>
      <p>But no further rainfall is forecast today. River levels will remain high into Monday.</p>
      <p>Incident response staff are actively checking river levels and the weather forecast and are urging people to avoid roads, footpaths and bridges near the river.</p>
      <p>A further alert is in force for the River Arrow and River Alne in Warwickshire, where water levels are high after heavy rain.</p>
      <p>The agency says flooding is possible and is already affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the River Arrow between Studley and Salford Priors, and between Bird in Hand and Alcester on the River Alne including farmland and caravan parks.</p>
      <p>River levels are expected to remain high into Monday and, once again, the agency is urging people to plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded, and avoid using low-lying footpaths and bridges near local watercourses.</p>
