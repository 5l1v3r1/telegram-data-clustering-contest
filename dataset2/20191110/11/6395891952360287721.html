      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - Britain's biggest political parties are accusing each other of financial recklessness as they vie to win voters' trust on the economy ahead of Britain's Dec. 12 election.</p>
      <p>The main opposition Labour Party accused the governing Conservatives on Sunday of spreading fake news with an eye-catching claim that Labour spending pledges will cost 1.2 trillion pounds ($1.5 trillion) over five years.</p>
      <p>The figure is based on assuming a Labour government would implement every policy it has adopted in principle. Labour says not all those pledges will be in its official election platform.</p>
      <p>Labour economy spokesman John McDonnell said the Conservative figure was "an incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths."</p>
      <p>Treasury chief Sajid Javid stood by the estimate, saying Labour's proposals were "absolutely reckless."</p>
