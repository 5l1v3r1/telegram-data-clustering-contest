      <h3>AFTER  his visit to Leyte to witness the groundbreaking ceremony of housing projects for typhoon Yolanda victims in Tanauan and to give aid to fire victims in Tacloban, Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go went to Cebu City and provided relief assistance to victims of three recent fire incidents in the city.</h3>
      <p>More than 600 families were gathered at the gymnasium of Barangay Tinago. Most lost their homes in the fires that occurred in Barangay Mambaling on October 31, Barangay Basak San Nicolas on November 1, and Barangay San Roque on November 3.</p>
      <p>“Hindi ko matiis na magpalamig lang sa loob ng Senado. Kahit saang sulok po ng Pilipinas, pupuntahan ko po kayo hanggang sa makakaya ko para magbigay ng tulong at mag-iwan ng ngiti sa oras ng inyong pagdadalamhati,” Go told the victims, explaining that he regularly visits victims of calamities to listen to their concerns and provide solutions to their daily struggles.</p>
      <p>The victims also received assistance from several government agencies, such as the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), National Housing Authority (NHA), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), and Land Transportation Office (LTO).</p>
      <p>Staff of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV) and employees of Cebu City Department of Social Welfare and Services (DSWS) also extended help to the victims.</p>
      <p>Before going to Cebu, Go attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a housing project that will benefit the victims of supertyphoon Yolanda in Tanauan, Leyte, and provided assistance to the victims of a recent fire in Tacloban City.</p>
      <p>In an interview after the distribution of assistance in Cebu, Go reiterated his stand that the fight against illegal drugs must continue and an iron hand is needed in dealing with drug lords. “Hindi natin pwedeng i-baby ang mga drug lords na ito. Itong mga drug lords na ito, halang ang kaluluwa,” he said.</p>
      <p>He uttered the statement in response to Vice President Leni Robredo’s declaration on Thursday, November 7, that there will be zero killings when she officially sits as co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD).</p>
      <p>The senator emphasized that the Duterte administration’s war against illegal drugs has been effective, as indicated by the approval that the President receives from the Filipino people. “Kaya nga 82 percent of Filipinos are satisfied, kuntento po sa pagpatakbo ni Pangulong Duterte sa kampanya laban sa droga.”</p>
      <p>Go assured the public, though, that the President and his administration will give Robredo the needed support to implement her plans. “Full support kami. We want her to succeed. Kung kaya ni Vice President Leni, gawin niyang 90 percent o kahit 100 percent ang satisfaction rating,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Basta para sa kabutihan, sa interes ng lahat Pilipino, full support kami,” he added.</p>
