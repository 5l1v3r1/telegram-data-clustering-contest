      <h1>Neil Lennon issues Celtic, Rangers and Scotland fixture plea to SPFL</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops would welcome a meeting with league bosses over fixture congestion.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:41:50+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon wants the SPFL to aid Celtic, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and the national team in their quest to improve the reputation of Scottish football.</p>
      <p>The Hoops boss would welcome talks with the league's governing body over easing fixture congestion as he and counterpart <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> strive for Europa League success.</p>
      <p>But it's Scotland's plight Lennon feels is most urgent, with boss Steve Clarke preparing for Euro 2020 play-offs in March.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a>, whose side's European adventure will carry on past Christmas, believes the SPFL should bow to Clarke's every wish.</p>
      <p>Asked if he would be interested in a meeting aimed at giving all three teams optimum opportunity, Lennon replied: "Yes. Predominantly for the national team more than anything else.</p>

      <p>“Steve should get what he wants because the national team is a priority and these playoffs coming up are probably the most important games Scotland have had for a long time, so whatever he needs the authorities should give him what he wants, if it's the best for the national team for those games.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and Rangers' involvement in continental competition ensures regular fixtures on Thursdays and Sundays, with TV companies having a major say.</p>
      <p>Despite handling the schedule impressively so far, Lennon fears the heavy workload will catch up with his players eventually.</p>
      <p>And, with Scotland's improving UEFA coefficient potentially yielded a second Champions League place, he believes more can be done to help.</p>
      <p>Lennon added: "You are battling with the TV companies as well because they want the early kick-offs.</p>
      <p>“You are playing on a Thursday night and then you are in Aberdeen on Sunday for a 12.15 kick-off. Yeah we played well, got a great result, but it's still the players who have to go out and do the work and the fatigue or injury can cost you going forward.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes, we need a little bit of help on that, there's no question of that.”</p>
