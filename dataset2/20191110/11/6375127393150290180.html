      <h1>Supreme Court driving out robed hoodlums</h1>

      <h3>THE Supreme Court will create a Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) in a bid to cleanse the judiciary of so-called hoodlums in robes.</h3>
      <p>“We are now about to implement the Judicial Integrity Board,” said Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta.</p>
      <p>“We expect that this will perform its task very well and we hope that this will be a deterrent to those who are still with us and who are not supposed to be there,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Peralta appeared confident that a JIB can help the high court, specifically the Office of the Court Administrator, get rid of “misfits” in courts.</p>
      <p>“The OCAD has been doing its best in order to help the Court in weeding out the misfits and you are aware that we have been disciplining judges,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But we have to have an office that would help the OCAD because we have only a few lawyers to go around the Philippines and audit the performance of our judges,” Peralta said.</p>
      <p>On October 6, 2018, the SC passed Administrative Matters No. 18-01-05-SC approving the creation of the JIB.</p>
      <p>The JIB will be composed of a chairperson, vice chairperson, and three regular members, all of them with a three-year term.</p>
      <p>The chairperson and the vice chairperson must be retired SC justices and will be entitled to a compensation equivalent to the compensation of an incumbent magistrate of the high tribunal.</p>
      <p>The three regular members must either be a retired justice of the Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan or Court of Tax Appeals and will also be entitled to a compensation equivalent to the salary of incumbent magistrates of these courts.</p>
