        <b>Anthony Hamilton believes his son <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> can race in Formula 1 for at least another five years. Hamilton wrapped up his sixth Formula 1 title last weekend and is now chasing down Michael Schumacher's elusive total of seven. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton, who turns 35 in January, has another year left on his <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> contract but the British driver has said he is keen on working in 2021 and beyond. Hamilton's dad has provided Lewis with support and the determination needed throughout his career. His dad is now pushing him for five more years. </p>
      <p><i>"Five to six years, that's where I'm pushing him. I said to Lewis you just have to keep going for as long as you really enjoy it. And if your body can keep up with it, then great, but if you're not enjoying it you know it's time to leave, but he loves the sport,"</i> Hamilton senior told Channel 4. </p>

        <i>"He’s on his plant-based diet which I think really does work for him, it’s worked for a lot of other athletes in the past. But I think the key is he will leave here [Austin], we’ll go home and he’ll probably be into his fashion or something else. He won’t be focusing on motorsport until he has to come back to the factory or the race circuit, and I think that’s what keeps him fresh."</i>
