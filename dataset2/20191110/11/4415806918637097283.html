      <p>Labour would plunge Britain into an economic crisis “within months”, Sajid Javid has warned, as he defended the Conservative’s claim that Jeremy Corbyn’s policies would cost £1.2tn (€1.3tn)</p>
      <p>The British Chancellor said the opposition would spend an extra £650 million a day if they win the General Election – labelling the levels of spending “eye-watering”.</p>
      <p>But Labour has condemned the analysis as a “ludicrous piece of Tory fake news” and an “incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths”.</p>
      <blockquote>These are eye-watering levels of spending - £1.2tn (€1.3tn). It will be absolutely reckless and will leave this country with an economic crisis within months, not years.</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Javid said the proposals – which include plans to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy – were “absolutely reckless” and equivalent to funding the entire NHS budget for nine years.</p>
      <p>He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “This is the true cost of Corbyn’s Labour: these are the numbers that John McDonnell did not want you to see, and they’re out there today…</p>
      <p>“These are eye-watering levels of spending – £1.2tn (€1.3tn).</p>
      <p>“It will be absolutely reckless and will leave this country with an economic crisis within months, not years.”</p>
      <p>But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “Labour will tax the rich to pay for things everyone needs and deserves, like decent housing, healthcare and support for our children.</p>
      <p>“We will also use the power of the state to invest to grow our economy, create good jobs in every region and nation and tackle the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>“The Conservatives will be able to read all about these plans – and how much they actually cost – when we publish our fully-costed manifesto.”</p>
      <p>The analysis, overseen by Mr Javid, is based on costings for Labour’s last manifesto and its most recent pledges, spread across a five-year period.</p>
      <p>Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said Labour would not implement every policy from its annual conference – as the party could “only do a certain amount at once”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng was unable to put a price on his own party’s pledges, and told Sky: “I’m not going to bandy around figures.”</p>
      <p>It came as:</p>
      <p>– Party leaders displayed a rare moment of unity as they pause their campaigns to pay their respects at the National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph.</p>

      <p>– Labour’s shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne refused to say whether a Labour government’s Brexit deal would end freedom of movement.</p>
      <p>– Credit ratings agency Moody’s lowering its outlook for UK debt to “negative” from “stable”.</p>
      <p>– Mr Kwarteng said Boris Johnson was right to claim there would be no barriers to trade crossing the Irish Sea after Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Gwynne told the BBC that the £1.2tn (€1.3tn) claim was an “absolute work of fiction” by Tories, adding: “You can’t trust a word that Johnson and his ministers say on this issue.</p>
      <p>“We will have a fully-costed manifesto in due course when we launch that, and the challenge actually is for the Conservatives to fully cost their own manifesto, something they didn’t do in 2017.”</p>
      <p>Asked what the correct figure for Labour’s spending is, the shadow communities secretary said: “Well look, that’s still being finalised.”</p>
