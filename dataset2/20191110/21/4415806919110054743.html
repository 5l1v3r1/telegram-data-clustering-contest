      <p>Vincent Kompany insisted VAR should have intervened and studied a Manchester City penalty claim before Liverpool broke away to open the scoring in their 3-1 Anfield victory.</p>
      <p>Fabinho’s sixth-minute strike came just 22 seconds after the ball had struck the arm of Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold in his own penalty area and referee Michael Oliver had waved play on.</p>
      <p>Moments before the penalty claim the ball had ricocheted on to the arm of City forward Bernardo Silva.</p>

      <p>“One way or another the action should have been stopped there and then in the other box,” former City captain Kompany said on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“You can argue about Bernardo’s handball before. I don’t think he knows anything about it. It’s a natural position.</p>
      <p>“But (Alexander-Arnold) is a handball, that’s not a natural position. Stop the action then and make a decision.</p>
      <p>“You go which way you want to go, but my interpretation is that Bernardo’s hand is in a natural position and Alexander-Arnold’s isn’t.”</p>
      <blockquote>One way or another the action should have been stopped there and then in the other box</blockquote>
      <p>“One way or another it’s had an effect on the game. I can understand why there’s (City) frustration.”</p>

      <p>Fellow pundit Roy Keane said: “See that next week and it will be a penalty.</p>
      <p>“It was a huge moment, but they still had to travel up the pitch and City have to defend better than that.”</p>
      <p>Former Premier League referee Bobby Madley took to social media to point out that City would not have been awarded a penalty upon VAR review as the ball originally struck the arm of Bernardo.</p>
      <p>“Point of law…as Silva handled the ball (albeit accidental) before TAA did this would have been penalised even if a penalty had been awarded,” Madley wrote in a tweet, which he later deleted.</p>
      <p>“Attacking handball doesn’t have to be deliberate. So, a penalty would never have been possible due to it touching Silva hand in build up.”</p>

      <p>Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane put the game out of sight for Liverpool before a late consolation from Bernardo Silva.</p>
      <p>Unbeaten Liverpool have won 11 of their 12 league games are now nine points clear of fourth-placed City, who trail Leicester and Chelsea by one point.</p>
      <p>But Kompany said: “It’s worth remembering how City finished the game.</p>
      <p>“Anfield’s always been a problem, not just this year but time and time again.</p>

      <p>“It’s a physical battle in the middle of the pitch that City have lost. I’m talking across the years, we’ve just not been able to deal with that.</p>
      <p>“Did it mean that we didn’t win titles or the club has not been moving forward? Not at all.</p>
      <p>“So I would take the positives, learn and progress and understand that this league has not been played yet.”</p>
      <p>But former Manchester United captain Keane believes Liverpool will take huge confidence from beating the reigning champions.</p>
      <p>“I know City had a go in the last 15-20 minutes but to me the game was over,” Keane said.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool just sat back, were 3-0 up. I said before City are worthy champions and I don’t think it will have a big knock-on effect on them, because they’ve got a brilliant coach and brilliant players</p>

      <p>“But the effect on Liverpool – already the European champions and the best team in England – going forward will be massive.”</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho feels Liverpool are now guaranteed to be champions, saying: “From my position I think it’s done unless something dramatic happens in terms of an injury situation breaks the team.</p>
      <p>“But I think the team is a complete puzzle. They play exactly the way they are adapted to the players.</p>
      <p>“City are capable of winning seven, eight, nine matches in a  row, but I don’t see how Liverpool can lose the advantage they have.”</p>
