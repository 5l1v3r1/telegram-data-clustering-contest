      <h1>Kate Middleton's sweet Remembrance service outfit choice in memory of hero gran</h1>
      <h2>The Royal Family joined veterans and politicians at the Cenotaph on Sunday to honour the nation's war heroes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:27:16+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:27</time> by <a rel="author">Amy-Clare Martin</a></address>
      <p>The Queen had a cluster, Meghan wore one - and Kate had a poppy brooch with a personal significance few onlookers at the Cenotaph on Sunday may have realised.</p>
      <p>The 'code-breaker's poppy' is a poignant tribute to her grandmother Valerie Glassborow, who worked in signal intelligence at Bletchley Park during the war.</p>
      <p>It was there that teams worked tirelessly to crack German codes and give allied troops the best possible chance at victory.</p>
      <p>Kate's brooch, which has “lest we forget” inscribed on the back, was released earlier this year to honour the 13,000 men and women on the Bletchley Park roll of honour.</p>

      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge stood alongside the Queen to watch royals, politicians and members of the armed forces lay poppy wreaths at the foot of the Cenotaph.</p>
      <p>In a rare show of emotion, the Queen was seen wiping away a tear shortly after Prince Charles laid a tribute on her behalf.</p>
      <p>Prince Charles was followed by the Duke of Cambridge, Duke of Sussex, Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Kent in laying wreaths in Whitehall, Central London.</p>
      <p>An equerry placed one on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh, who retired from royal duties in 2017. </p>
      <p>Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, wore a wide-brimmed black hat as she watched the event from a balcony with Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence.</p>

      <p>The royals were joined by Britain’s political leaders, as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> put aside their differences to stand side-by-side to pay their respects. Mr Johnson appeared to blunder by placing his wreath upside down.</p>
      <p>Crowds observed a two-minute silence as Big Ben struck 11am.</p>
      <p>The nation will hold another two-minute silence today, marking 100 years since the first one was observed on Armistice Day on November 11, 1919.</p>
      <p>For the first time, the Ambassador of Nepal placed a wreath to honour Gurkha regiments’ roles in Britain’s military campaigns over 200 years.</p>

      <p>Foreign Secretary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dominic-raab-mp">Dominic Raab</a> and Home Secretary Priti Patel laid wreaths on behalf of the intelligence services for the first time – on the 100th anniversary of GCHQ and the 110th anniversaries of MI5 and MI6. Following the ceremony, up to 10,000 veterans and servicemen and women marched past the Cenotaph to honour the fallen. The capital’s event came as people up and down the country turned out in force to pay their respects to the nation’s veterans.</p>
      <p>In Dover, Kent, the white cliffs were showered with 750,000 poppies dropped from a Second World War Dakota plane, flanked by two Spitfires.</p>
      <p>The county’s iconic cliff face formed a welcoming sight for hundreds of thousands of British soldiers returning from Dunkirk in 1940. Five veterans, including RAF servicemen who served in the Second World War, were on the flight to oversee the poppy drop.</p>

      <p>Great-grandfather Roy Briggs, 94, a Second World War veteran Warrant Officer, said he spent the flight thinking of a Lancaster crew he knew who lost their lives during a mission.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am 94 and they are still 20 and 21. They will never be anything else to me.” In Doncaster, South Yorks, paratrooper Ben Parkinson, Britain’s most severely injured serviceman, laid a wreath at Remembrance Sunday commemorations.</p>
      <p>Lance Bombardier Parkinson, 34, lost both legs and suffered brain damage when the armoured Land Rover he was travelling in hit a mine in Helmand Province in 2006.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> leader Nicola Sturgeon led commemorations at the Stone of Remembrance at Edinburgh City Chambers. And players and fans fell silent at football grounds around the country before matches kicked off.</p>
      <p>Despite snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures, a wreath and a cross were placed on the summit of Mount Snowdon. The wreath was dedicated to Sgt Major Mike Williams, from Caerphilly, South Wales, who was killed in Afghanistan in 2008.</p>
