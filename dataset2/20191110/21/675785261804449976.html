      <p>The third celebrity who landed in Australia for the new series of I'm A Celebrity is stand up comedian Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old touched down at Brisbane Airport in the early hours of Monday morning local time having flown in from the UK via Dubai.</p>
      <p>As well as doing stand up, the 44-year-old is best known for being the narrator of Ex-On The Beach.</p>
      <p>After landing he told photographers he wouldn’t take his sunglasses off as “no one will know who I am anyway”.</p>
      <p>Asked about what he was scared of he said: “Snakes but I am going to fight them. We don’t have snakes in Ireland and you should never trust an animal without shoulders who can’t shrug.”</p>

      <p>Others names already in Australia to go on the ITV jungle are US reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner and former footballer Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>Other celebs in the frame to take part this year include GMB breakfast TV presenter Kate Garraway and former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle.</p>

      <p>More arrivals are expected over the next couple of days before filming begins.</p>
      <p>Bookmakers Ladbrokes have Ian Wright as favourite to win, although last year's King of the Jungle Harry Redknapp told the Mirror he was worried about him keeping his temper in camp.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’d tell him ‘Keep calm, Wrighty’. He’s got a short fuse. I played golf with him the other day and he threw a bit of a wobbler with another player.</p>
      <p>“You have to bite your tongue in the camp. It’s hard. You can get tetchy as there’s nothing to do. It gets boring.”</p>
      <p>The show will once again be hosted by Ant and Dec, after Ant took a year off in 2018 because of drink and drug related issues.</p>
      <p>* The opening episode of I'm A Celebrity airs on Sunday night at 9pm on ITV.</p>
