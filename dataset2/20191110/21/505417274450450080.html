      <h1>Aaron Connolly An Injury Doubt For Ireland's Upcoming Games</h1>

        <b>Aaron Connolly has emerged as an injury doubt for the Republic of Ireland’s upcoming games.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland play New Zealand in a friendly on Thursday before facing Denmark in a crucial Euro 2020 qualifier on November 18, a game they must win to qualify for the tournament next summer.</p>
      <p>Both games will be at the Aviva Stadium and Mick McCarthy could be without Connolly for the fixtures.</p>
      <p>The Brighton and Hove Albion forward, who made his senior debut for the national team last month, was forced off at half-time against Manchester United on Sunday. Connolly will have a scan on a groin injury on Monday morning before a decision is made on his availability.</p>
      <p>“Aaron will have a scan on Monday morning,” McCarthy told the <a href="https://www.fai.ie/ireland/news/mick-mccarthy-waits-on-aaron-connolly-scan">FAI’s website</a> on Sunday evening.</p>
      <blockquote>“Our medical team have been in contact with Brighton and when we have the results on Monday, we will know more.”</blockquote>
      <p>Connolly has scored three goals in 11 appearances for the Seagulls this season. He netted a brace against Tottenham Hotspur last month in a three-nil win and was subsequently promoted to the Ireland senior squad. Connolly made his Ireland debut in the draw against Georgia before earning his first senior start a few days later in the 2-0 loss to Switzerland.</p>
      <p>In a video with the FAI, McCarthy also confirmed that Jack Byrne will feature against New Zealand on Thursday. Byrne was named PFAI Player of the Year on Saturday night for his performances this year for Shamrock Rovers.</p>
