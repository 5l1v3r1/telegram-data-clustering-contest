      <p>A 'County lines' drug dealer from Birmingham tried to flush wraps of heroin and crack cocaine down the toilet as police came through the front door of flat he was staying in, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Alan George Lake had more than £1,350 in cash on him when cops grabbed him - and was subsequently discovered to have a quantity of cannabis hidden inside his body.</p>
      <p>Lake is being investigated over links to a West Midlands-based gang which has recently moved into the city, Swansea Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>He become a major player in the drugs market, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/swansea-crime-drugs-heroin-crack-17223008">WalesOnline</a> , our sister title.</p>
      <p>Gareth Waite, prosecuting, said two South Wales Police officers went to a flat in the Port Tennant area of the city on October 6 this year after a call from the female resident saying there was a man in her property who was "being threatening and refusing to leave".</p>
      <p>He said when officers arrived at the David Williams Terrace property they looked through a front window and saw a male quickly leaving the room - the officers gained entry to the flat, and detained Lake.</p>
      <p>Police then recovered nine wraps of heroin and crack from the toilet bowl in the bathroom.</p>

      <p>The prosecutor said it was not know how many, if any, other wraps had been successfully disposed of via the toilet before officers got to the defendant.</p>
      <p>When 27-year-old Lake was searched he was found to £1,355 cash along with "drugs concealed in his anus" which turned out to be cannabis.</p>
      <p>The court heard the tenant of the flat told officers Lake had arrived at her flat the previous night in the company of a woman - he had told her his name was "T", and he had heroin and crack.</p>
      <p>Mr Waite said an examination of the defendant's mobile phone showed calls and texts to people in Swansea known to be involved in drugs, as well as to somebody with links to Liverpool.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said Lake was currently under investigation by police in North Yorkshire and in Humberside for drugs matters, and by police in West Midlands and South Wales investigating a county lines gang called the "T line".</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said police believed the "T line" had been activate in Swansea in recent months, and had "quickly established itself as a major supplier".</p>
      <p>Lake, of Alder Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham, had previously pleaded guilty to possession of heroin, crack, and cannabis with intent to supply when he appeared in the dock for sentencing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The court heard he has 13 previous convictions for 23 offences including for possession of amphetamine and cannabis with intent to supply, and robbery. He is currently on a community order imposed in Humber Magistrates' Court in April this year for common assault and possession of cannabis.</p>
      <p>Ieuan Rees, for Lake, said the only real mitigation he could put forward for the defendant were his guilty pleas.</p>
      <p>He said the father-of-two had come to Swansea to "get away from the crowd he was mixing with in Birmingham" but had fallen in with bad company once in Wales.</p>
      <p>The barrister said Lake was at a "crossroads" in his life, and wanted to take qualifications in construction trades while in prison and to "break all contact with the life-style he has been leading".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Judge Geraint Walters said it was clear Lake had been operating a "well-stocked business" supplying Class A drugs in Swansea as part of an organised county line operation.</p>
      <p>He said such drugs ruined the lives of "pathetic users" - turning them into people who "do not live, just exist" - and are a blight on communities where decent people have to go about their daily lives with addicts and dealers on street corners.</p>
      <p>Judge Walters said: "The public are rightly concerned about the situation, and the police are rightly targeting it - and it seems to me, from where I sit, targeting it with a fair degree of success."</p>
      <p>Giving the defendant a one-third discount for his guilty pleas the judge sentenced him to 40 months for possession of heroin with intent to supply, 40 months for possession of crack with intent to supply, and 12 months for possession of cannabis with intent to supply - all these sentences will run concurrently.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The judge revoked the community order from justices in Humber and sentenced Lake to two months for those offences - this sentence will run consecutively with the Swansea matters making an overall sentence of 42 months.</p>
      <p>Judge Walters ordered the cash found on Lake to be given to South Wales Police for use in their fight against drug crime.</p>
