Michelle’s been drag-ged down to the bottom with her first dance off. <br/>Savage.  Saffron is back on the top. Emma B is reviving Anton after his shock about staying in the comp for more than 3 minutes. Everyone’s in love with Luke Evans now. Even more than before. Shirley’s off the hook this week because Mike’s out and she didn’t make a boo boo. THANK GOD.  Claudia's learnt to keep her jokes to herself after taking the pee out of Karim. We wonder if she'll still buy him a stick of rock? Motsi is off to do some research about years gone by after her comment about affairs.  Technically snogs but whatever… Ouch. Kevin's probably crying in his dressing room. He's not. He's lovely.  Lest not forget Kimberley Walsh last night in the frow with her Emmerdale sis Amy. Oh, and that actress Famke whatshername. What a show. What a night. What a weekend. Eyes and feet and fingers burning. CAN’T WAIT for next week. Where is it again? Oh yeah… BLACKPOOL. KEEP READING. I MEAN, DANCING. </li>

Performing Bring Him Home. Luke will Certainly bring a tear to your eye it’s brilliant.” Is she tearing up because he won't go home with her. Joke, SB. Don't sue.</li>

It's almost as if he made a bet on Mike leaving tonight. He's delighted. Maybe Strictly and DWTS doesn't pay enough.</li>
