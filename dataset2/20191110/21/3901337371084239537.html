      <p>Kaizer Chiefs’ win over Orlando Pirates may have sent them 10 points clear at the top of the table, but also came at a cost as three key players were all ruled out of their semifinal.</p>

      <p>The Glamour Boys head into the international break flying high at the top of the Absa Premiership table after their 3-2 win over Orlando Pirates, with defeats for Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits putting them in a very comfortable position at the top of the log.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Now though, with a number of players heading into international duty with their respective nations, Ernst Middendorp has to plan for a Telkom Knockout semi against his former club, Maritzburg United, knowing that he has three potential starters all suspended and out of contention.</p>
      <p>Both Willard Katsande and Daniel Akpeyi were shown their fourth yellow cards of the season in the Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium yesterday afternoon, meaning that they now face a one-game suspension, while Erick Mathoho’s sending off forces him out of their next two matches.</p>
      <p>Bruce Bvuma is likely to come in for Akpeyi with Itumeleng Khune still struggling for fitness, while it remains to be seen who Middendorp will opt for in the centre of his defence and midfield in place of Mathoho and Katsande.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Add the suspended trio to Chiefs’ list of injuries and players in recovery, and it’s not an ideal situation for the German head coach, however given their impressive form he’ll be confident of getting a result against Maritzburg regardless of their absentees.</p>
