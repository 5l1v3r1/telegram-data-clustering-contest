      <h2>Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri hooked off Cristiano Ronaldo for Paulo Dybala, with the substitute going onto score the winner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:41:41+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:41</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo reacted angrily after being withdrawn during Juventus' clash with AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, 34, was withdrawn early in the second half after a below-par performance and replaced by Paulo Dybala.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese gestured in frustration at the decision and stormed past boss Maurizio Sarri and straight down the tunnel, looking furious.</p>
      <p>The decision ultimately paid off for the Italian champions with substitute Dybala scoring the winner.</p>
      <p>Gonzalo Higuain found the Argentine with a fine pass and Dybala made no mistake as he fired his finish into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>The win sees <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> return to the top of the Serie A table and makes it 10 wins from the first 12 games for Sarri since his return to Italy this summer.</p>
