      <p>REGINA -- Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe says he will meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa on Tuesday in a bid to advance his province's interests in the nation's capital.</p>
      <p>Moe announced the meeting in a news release on Sunday, saying he'll emphasize three priorities he raised earlier when the federal Liberals were returned to government with a minority in last month's election.</p>
      <p>They include adjusting the equalization formula, which Moe calls "inequitable," as well as putting a one-year pause on the carbon tax so federal and provincial officials can re-evaluate Saskatchewan's plan to address climate change.</p>
      <p>He says the third priority is expanding market access for Saskatchewan exports.</p>
      <p>Moe states in each case, Saskatchewan is proposing reasonable steps Trudeau and his government can take to show he is "prepared to address the concerns and frustrations of Saskatchewan people."</p>
      <p>Trudeau's relationship with some conservative premiers is strained after his decision to impose a price on pollution in any province without an equivalent system of its own, including Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Talk of western separation arose again after Alberta and Saskatchewan shut the Liberals out of the October vote.</p>
      <p>At a post-election conference of the conservative Manning Centre on Saturday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney noted his province's frustration over its position in the federation, and announced a panel that will examine ways to make the province more independent of Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, meanwhile, held his own sit-down meeting with Trudeau in Ottawa on Friday, saying he could help broker a truce between the prime minister and anti-carbon tax conservative premiers such as Kenney and Moe.</p>
      <p>Moe suggested late last month that increased support for western separatism is the end result of what has gone on over the first four years of a Trudeau government. But he said he believes Saskatchewan should be in a strong and united Canada.</p>
      <p>He said at the time that Trudeau needs to act if he's serious about wanting to improve relations with Western Canada by scrapping the federal carbon tax and revamping equalization.</p>
