      <h2>Oscar Bedford was born blue and unresponsive at Leicester Royal Infirmary - just as his parents were preparing to say their goodbyes the newborn's health took a remarkable turn for the better</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:26:51+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Mack</a></address>
      <p>A baby born lifeless and blue suddenly woke up just before he was due to be taken off life-support.</p>
      <p>Oscar Bedford entered this world in a difficult state.</p>
      <p>Despite doctors in the maternity ward making every effort, he showed no signs of coming to after arriving into the world unconscious, <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/lifeless-baby-taken-life-support-3517366">Leicester Mercury reported.</a></p>
      <p>After a spell in an incubator, Oscar was handed to his parents Greg and Chelsea who took him to a special room at Leicester Royal Infirmary for bereaved parents to say their goodbyes.</p>
      <p>“They said that after taking him off the incubator he would leave for minutes or maybe just seconds," the 26-year-old mum said.</p>
      <p>Fearing that she would never get to meet her grandson, Chelsea called her mum Sally-Ann on Facetime and pointed the camera at Oscar while he lay on her chest.</p>
      <p>Midway through the call something unexpected happened.</p>

      <p>“She was in the middle of the <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/all-about/highcross">Highcross</a> Shopping Centre when the call got through to her and as we were talking she saw Oscar open his eyes and she just screamed," she said.</p>
      <p>“His eyes were open for the first time and it was so surreal - it felt like a dream.</p>
      <p>“I sat on the bed and shook my head like people do in films. It was amazing - the best feeling in the world - but I had to pinch myself.”</p>
      <p>At the doctors' suggestion the new mum gave Oscar some of her own milk, which helped to perk him up for a trip to Rainbows hospice in Loughborough.</p>
      <p>Despite the drastic turnaround in the baby's health, Chelsea was warned not to get her hopes up too much.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “He was on an end-of-life plan with orders not to resuscitate him - but after three days he was taken off the plan.”</p>
      <p>Since then Oscar has been able to go back to his parents' home in Leicester.</p>
      <p>While he isn't free from health difficulties, he has been able to laugh and smile and interact with his parents.</p>
      <p>“He’s 18 months old now and he’s like a baby aged under three months but he smiles and he laughs and he loves lights, despite being partially blind,” Chelsea said.</p>

      <p>“He loves his trips to Rainbows – he enjoys hearing new voices and listening to music.</p>
      <p>“He really likes being held and he babbles a lot.”</p>
      <p>Oscar has a life-limiting form of epilepsy and it is unclear how long he will survive.</p>
      <p>Chelsea said: “He was in intensive care a month ago and we thought we were going to lose him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how long I’m going to have with him but while he’s here I feel he should have everything – especially after all he’s been through.”</p>

      <p>As the mum and dad <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/eq25q-oscars-journey">try to raise money for physiotherapy</a> for Oscar, they are also preparing to welcome a little girl into the world.</p>
      <p>Chelsea, who worked as a care assistant before Oscar was born, said: “He’s going to really enjoy having a little sister.</p>
      <p>“He’s a bit of a sadist and always laughs at the sound of other babies crying!</p>
      <p>“I’m dreading it, having to look after both of them, but he is going to love it.”</p>
