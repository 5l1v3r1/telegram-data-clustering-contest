      <h1>No knee-jerk decision over Wayne Bennett's future, insists Kevin Sinfield</h1>
      <h2>Veteran Australian coach's future is under the spotlight after three straight Lions defeats</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Stott</a></address>
      <p>Kevin Sinfield insists Wayne Bennett will not just be judged on the current disastrous Great Britain tour.</p>
      <p>The Lions have misfired badly in two <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/new-zealand-23-8-great-20845846">defeats to New Zealand</a>, plus one to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/great-britain-6-14-tonga-20728500">Tonga</a>, and now need to beat Papua New Guinea to avoid a total nightmare.</p>
      <p>Bennett is out of contract after Saturday's game in Port Moresby and has said he wants to stay on as England coach.</p>
      <p>Many fans are calling for his head in the belief that his dull brand of rugby will flop against Australia next year and the World Cup in 2021.</p>

      <p>But RFL director of rugby Sinfield says there will be no knee-jerk reaction on the back on the results Down Under.</p>
      <p>He said: "We will wait until the end of the series although dialogue has already started and has been on-going for some time.</p>
      <p>"Wayne is here as Great Britain but we should take into account performances as England coach as well when we decide what happens over the next couple of years.</p>

      <p>"Although there is some disappointment this time with Great Britain, it is important to understand the changes and transition that has happened.</p>
      <p>"There are some top international players missing. If you take that quality out of any national team they are going to struggle."</p>
      <p>Sam Burgess pulled out on the eve of the series and has since retired, while key players like Tommy Makinson, Sean O'Loughlin and Luke Gale are among the others out injured.</p>
