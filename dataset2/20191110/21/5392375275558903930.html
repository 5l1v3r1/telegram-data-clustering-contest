      <p>Google Stadia now available on Play Store<br/>3.6 (71.67%) 12 votes <br/>Google Stadia is a cloud gaming service from <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/google">Google</a>. It supports a high-dynamic-range and is capable of streaming video games up to 4K resolution at 60fps. However, it requires a good high-speed internet connection (no problem for 5G users). Google Stadia is available via Google Chrome for desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, digital media players, and Chromecast. However, there is now an official app for the game streaming service in the Google Play Store.</p>

      <p>This is a little surprising because we werent expecting Google Stadia App. For now, Stadia should only work on Google’s latest smartphones. However, there are reports that this app app can be installed on many other devices (certainly not on Xiaomi Mi 9SE and Xiaomi Mi MIX 3 which I use). If you are not able to play on other devices, you may still be able to manage Stadia accounts.<br/>It takes an invite code to to get access and this code is not available for non-Google devices for now. Officially Stadia has been announced for Google Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a and Pixel 4. If you cant access it on your phone, you can still play it on PC via Chrome and Chromecast Ultra.<br/><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.stadia.android">Source</a></p>
