      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers foward Adama Traore has dropped out of the Spain squad with an injury less than 24 hours after being called up to replace Valencia's Rodrigo Moreno.</p>
      <p>Traore's place in Robert Moreno's squad has been taken by Paris Saint-Germain forward Pablo Sarabia, who will join up with the rest of the La Roja team as Las Rozas this week ahead of games against Malta and Romania.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately I cannot attend the call from Spain due to an injury picked up in Sunday's game against Aston Villa," former Barcelona man Traore said.</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry I can't be in the squad this time but I will keep working hard to be in the best form possible to be in future squads, God permitting. I want to thank the coach for the confidence shown in me."</p>
      <p>Traore, 23, is also eligible for Mali and earlier this week had suggested he would commit his international future to the African nation.</p>
