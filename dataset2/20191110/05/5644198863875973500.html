      <p>WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will host NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg in Washington at a time of severe strain within the Atlantic alliance, the White House announced Saturday (Nov 9).</p>
      <p>The two leaders will discuss NATO allies' "progress on increasing defense spending and ensuring more equitable burden-sharing," the White House statement said.</p>

      <p>Trump has been a frequent critic of alliance members, notably Germany, complaining that many have not met their goal of devoting two percent of economic output to defense spending.</p>
      <p>Trump and Stoltenberg, who is Norwegian, will also discuss counterterrorism, cyber-security and protecting critical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The Thursday meeting will come a week after NATO came in for cutting criticism from French president Emmanuel Macron, who told The Economist magazine that "what we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO."</p>
      <p>Macron cited a general lack of coordination between the US and Europe and the recent unilateral incursion by Turkey, a key member of the 70-year-old military alliance, into northern Syria.</p>
      <p>"Strategically and politically," Macron said, "we need to recognize that we have a problem."</p>
      <p>Macron was speaking ahead of a NATO summit meeting scheduled for December 3 and 4 in London.</p>
      <p>But German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking alongside Stoltenberg in Berlin after the Macron interview came out, defended NATO as "indispensable."</p>
      <p>Macron "used drastic words," she said, adding, "that is not my view of cooperation in NATO."</p>
      <p>In Washington, the NATO chief will also confer Thursday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and members of Congress, the alliance said.</p>
      <p>That same day, he will attend a ministerial-level meeting of a broad international coalition against the Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>This session was requested urgently by France after Trump announced he was pulling US troops out of northern Syria, raising fears that the jihadist organization could stage a comeback.</p>
