      <blockquote>In an interview with Russian media, the Brazilian native said that he <a href="https://sputniknews.com/videoclub/201812311071108448-russia-dishes-football-player/">was a very open person</a> - a quality that was occasionally exploited by others. With time, Marinato noted that feature of his character was not suitable here "because one has to draw a balance", adding that he modified his behavior.</blockquote>
      <p>The goalkeeper also said, cited by the media, that there <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201904161074182043-russia-visa-free/">is no racism in Russian professional football</a>. Football fans can, however, joke sometimes in a light way about his nationality, Marinato noted.</p>
      <p>Marinato has been playing for Lokomotiv since 2007 and became a champion of Russian tournament. In 2015, Marinato gained Russian citizenship. Currently he <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201909071076743316-russian-national-football-team-beats-scotland-2-1-in-uefa-euro-2020-qualifying-match/">is the main goalkeeper</a> on the roster of the Russian national team.</p>
