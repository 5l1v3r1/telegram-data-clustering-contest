      <p>NEW DELHI: After <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> upset India by winning the first T20I of the ongoing three-match series, stand-in skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> led by example in the second game to take his side home for a series-levelling victory with his match-winning knock (85), and former India batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mohinder-Amarnath">Mohinder Amarnath</a> believes Rohit's "presence in all three formats" has made him more stable and consistent.</p>
      <p>"Over the last few seasons, India have invariably come back strongly after a defeat, and it was no different in Rajkot (second T20I). India brought the series to 1-1 thanks to a resurgent bowling performance as well as a masterclass from Rohit Sharma," Amarnath wrote in his column for The Times of India on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The two teams will lock horns in the decider on Sunday.</p>
      <p>After setting the World Cup on fire with five centuries, Rohit made his first appearance as a Test opener in the home series against South Africa and aggregated a whopping 529 runs in three Tests, with a highest of 212 and average of 132.25.</p>
      <p>"The stand-in captain (for the T20I series against Bangladesh) has hardly put a foot wrong since the World Cup and now looks to be in the form of his life," Amarnath wrote. "I think his presence in all three formats of the game has added stability and consistency to his performance.</p>
      <p>"I used to be surprised that he was not part of the Test team, but his promotion to opener has brought a new dimension to his game and also gives the Indians an attacking and technically assured option at the top. Hopefully, he will continue his good form in Tests and who knows, in time he could blossom into an opener like Virender Sehwag."</p>
      <p>Amarnath reckoned Bangladesh, who are missing their talisman all-rounder Shakib Al Hasaan, face a stiff ask against a "settled" India in the third and final T20I in Nagpur.</p>
      <p>"As India head to Nagpur for the decider, they look a settled side. Shikhar Dhawan, who was an able foil to Rohit in Rajkot, would be looking to stamp his presence on this match. He still possesses the power game and if he gets going he still can turn a match dramatically.</p>
      <p>"For Bangladesh, the experience and class of Shakib Al Hasan is a gap they are finding more and more difficult to fill. He would have ensured that they capitalized on the good start had he been there," Amarnath concluded.</p>
