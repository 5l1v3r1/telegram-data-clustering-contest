      <p>During this weekend's Pro League Finals, held in Tokoname, Japan, Ubisoft revealed details on the fourth and final event of Year 4 in its tense tactical shooter<i> Rainbow Six Siege</i>. Operation Shifting Tides brings two new operators into the fold, alongside a new map rework and a small selection of mechanical tweaks.<br/><br/>Our first operator, hailing from India is Attacker Kali. The head of her own private military faction, NIGHTHAVEN, Kali is the first dedicated sniper to join the squad of deadly R6 operators in some time. Kali is equipped with a CSRX 300 Sniper Rifle, an immensely powerful bolt-action weapon that can breach multiple walls, barricades, and bodies with a single slug, essentially making enemy pings an instant crosshair for the sharpshooter.<br/><br/>Her gadget is attached to the CSRX 300 as an under-barrel weapon. The LV Explosive Lance can be fired into walls and barricades, immediately destroying all nearby gadgets attached on either side, thus prepping a room for safe breaching, clearing out anti-projectile tools, or simply inducing panic in the enemy.</p>

      <p>Our new Defender is Kenyan Wamai, who is the best operative in NIGHTHAVEN. Wamai has a great sounding gadget, the Mag-NET System, which automatically attracts enemy-thrown projectiles and has them detonate once acquired. Thus, carefully hidden away, the Mag-NET could potentially send flashbangs and frags directly back at their owner. This gadget, like Fuze's APM-6, sounds like a tool that in the right hands could be incredibly powerful, but in the wrong ones could be more trouble than its worth. I really dig the creative possibilities though. Both operators are 2 Speed 2 Armour.<br/><br/>Theme Park is the next map in line for a rework. The rail platform segue is to be removed entirely, and the downstairs portion in the east is to be reworked. In fact, the arcade main entrance is now gone, and a new gong room will now serve as the main point of entry. The whole map has a brighter aesthetic, which is disappointing, as I dug the creepy haunted house vibe. Looks like Doktor's Curse was the last hurrah for Theme Park Classic.<br/><br/>Operation Shifting Tides will go live on the <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i> PC test server on November 11. Each event usually follows on the main server a couple of weeks later. <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One.</p>
