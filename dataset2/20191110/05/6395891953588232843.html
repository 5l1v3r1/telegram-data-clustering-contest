      <p><b>ALLENSTOWN, N.H.</b> - Victims of a serial killer whose bodies were found in barrels in New Hampshire can now rest in peace.</p>
      <p>For decades, the victims were only known as part of the "Allenstown Four." Over the summer, investigators identified three of them.</p>
      <p>Marlyse Honeychurch and her daughters, Marie Vaughn and Sarah McWaters, were buried in barrels in Allenstown's Bear Brook State Park, along with another young girl. Investigators now know that fourth victim is the daughter of the accused killer.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Marlyse and Marie were interred together at a graveside service.</p>
