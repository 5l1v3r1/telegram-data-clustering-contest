      <h1>Boxer has lie down mid-fight and throws punches after bell in KSI vs Logan Paul undercard farce</h1>
      <h2>Nikita Ababiy's fight with Jonathan Batista was stopped at the end of the first round after several minutes of chaos</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:08:02+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>The final fight on the undercard between KSI and Logan Paul descended into farce as Jonathan Batista was disqualified at the end of the first round.</p>
      <p>Dominican journeyman Batista was clipped on the back of the head by a shot by blue chip prospect Nikita Ababiy, who had scored a knockdown early in the fight.</p>
      <p>Batista made the most of the blow by collapsing to the canvas and refusing to stand for several moments, prompting the doctor to enter the ring.</p>
      <p>He eventually got up and continued, with Ababiy deducted a point for the illegal shot.</p>
      <p>And with a new lease of life, Batista went for the jugular in the closing stages of the round only to continue his assault after the bell as the referee stepped in.</p>

      <p>He was rightly disqualified by the referee after a bizarre series of events in the final clash before KSI and Logan Paul's long-awaited rematch.</p>
      <p>Favourite Ababiy emerged with his eighth win from his eighth professional fight to continue the perfect start to his professional career.</p>
      <p>But it was not the evening "White Chocolate" envisioned as Batista created a bizarre fight with a strange ending.</p>

      <p>Sky Sports pundit and former world champion Johnny Nelson declared Batista "just didn't want to know" as he discussed a frustrating turn of events for Ababiy.</p>
      <p>"He didn't want to know, that's it, Batista just didn't want to know," Nelson said.</p>
      <p>"I think after the referee had split them, he wanted a way out, it's as simple as that.</p>
      <p>"It will be frustrating because he wants to impress, he wants to show off, he wants to get the big knockout and it just didn't happen.</p>
      <p>"He's fortunate not to get hit clean and get hurt."</p>
