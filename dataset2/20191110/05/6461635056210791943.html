      <h1>Serie A giants to pass over the opportunity to sign Barcelona superstar</h1>

      <h3>Serie A giants Inter Milan are not too keen to sign Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal, despite personal requests from manager Antonio Conte…</h3>
      <p>Barca midfielder Arturo Vidal has an admirer in Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte. The Chilean played under Conte during his time at Juventus and on the Italians return to Serie A, signing Vidal for Inter was one of his main agendas. The Nerazzurri did approach Barcelona with a prospect to take Arturo Vidal on loan as they had already spent heavily and could not afford to spend more money this summer. However, Barcelona rejected the deal as they were interested in only those deals that included a sale, a move the Blaugrana seemed to resort to in order to raise funds to re-sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>Arturo Vidal became an important squad member for Ernesto Valverde featuring 33 times for the Spanish giants in La Liga last season and has already played <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/arturo-vidal/leistungsdaten/spieler/37666"><b>8 La Liga games for Barca</b></a> this season, finding the back of the net on 3 ocassions.. But it became evident that the doors for Vidal to leave the Catalan club are open owing to the abundance in midfield. As reported by <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20190822/464208972598/arturo-vidal-cesion-inter-de-milan-barca.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a>, Vidal had already agreed personal terms with Inter and an agreement between the two clubs was all that was required for the move to pull through. Eventually, the move fell apart but Vidal has still constantly been linked to a move away from the Blaugrana.</p>
      <p>After rumors of Vidal’s move to the Italian side in January started doing the rounds, Inter Milan director Giuseppe Marotta was quick to put an end to the rumors. He was quoted saying the following, per <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/inter-milan-sign-arturo-vidal-one-chilean-is-enough-7716281"><b>Sport</b></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Arturo Vidal? Like Chilean fans, we’re anxiously waiting for the return of Alexis Sanchez. He should return to the group in January and he’ll feel like a new signing. One Chilean is enough.”</blockquote>
      <p>Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte was seemingly upset with the lack of squad depth which was evident in his post-match press conference after suffering a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Borussia Dortmund. However, Conte’s flare-up didn’t seem to have much effect as the Inter hierarchy don’t seem to be willing to change their policy about not overspending on players over the age of 30, as reported by <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/inter-marotta-dice-no-a-conte-niente-follie-per-vidal-93429"><b>La Repubblica</b></a>. Barcelona valued the player close to €40 million which put off Inter, given the fact that the Chilean midfielder was already 32 years old.  Apart from his age, Vidal’s off field antics are also something that are making the Inter officials think twice before signing him, report <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/inter-marotta-not-convinced-about-vidal-the-reasons-98945"><b>Tuttosport</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Will Arturo Vidal reunite with Conte at Inter Milan or will he see out his contract at Barcelona?</p>
