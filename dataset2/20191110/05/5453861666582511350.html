      <p>An anonymous reader quotes ZDNet: <i>The Russian Parliament is debating a bill that will force all electronic equipment sold in Russia — such as smartphones, computers, and smart TVs — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/phones-and-pcs-sold-in-russia-will-have-to-come-pre-installed-with-russian-apps/">to ship pre-installed with apps from Russian tech firms</a>. According to lawmakers, "the bill will protect the interests of Russian Internet companies and will reduce the abuse by large foreign companies, working in the field of information technology."<br/><br/>If <a href="https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/757423-7">the bill</a> is approved, the Russian government will publish a list of electronic devices that will need to comply with this new law. Smartphones, tablets, computers, servers, and smart TVs are expected to be on the list. Devices that don't run a complex OS or custom software will be exempt. The government will also publish, per each device type, a list of Russian software that equipment vendors will need to include on devices sold in Russia.</i></p>
