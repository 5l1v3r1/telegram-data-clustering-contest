      <h2>Raven's Rescue is looking for new homes for Bruno and his four-legged pals Bean, Logan, Rai and Imani</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Ashmore, https://www.facebook.com/dudleybclive/</a></address>
      <p>Bruno is a blind Jack Russell in urgent need of a loving home.</p>
      <p>The 12-year-old pooch is just one of the many unwanted hounds saved by Raven’s Rescue, a Dudley-based charity set up in 2012 to provide sanctuary to abandoned and abused animals.</p>
      <p>Unlike some rescues, it doesn’t use kennels, preferring to place dogs into foster homes until they land on their paws and find a forever home.</p>
      <p>And the charity is desperate to find the 'pawfect' place for Bruno to spend his later years.</p>

      <p>Bruno doesn't let his poor eyesight get him down and he is described as “a happy chap” who loves to be around people.</p>
      <p>He can see slightly, so is able to negotiate his way around the house without bumping into things.</p>
      <p>And although he gets on well with other dogs, he does require a quiet home - could you help? </p>
      <p>The charity is also looking for new family's for Bruno's four-legged friends Bean, Logan, Rai and Imani.</p>

      <p>All of the animals in the charity's care receive appropriate medical attention and are vaccinated, micro-chipped, neutered, behaviourally assessed and treated for parasites before re-homing. </p>
      <p>Home-checks and adoption fees apply.</p>
      <p>If you think you could give one of these pooches a home, call Sarah on 07922 204 531, Ryan on 07766 466 761 or visit <a href="http://ravensrescueuk.weebly.com/">ravensrescueuk.weebly.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Logan</h3>
      <p>Logan is a very nervous boy who needs someone he can learn to trust and love.</p>
      <p>The 10-year-old is in desperate need of an extremely patient owner who will let him come to them in his own time.</p>
      <p>He is describe as “very sweet” and is good with dogs and cats, however because of his nervous nature, he cannot be rehomed with children.</p>

      <h3>Rai</h3>
      <p>Rai is a one-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier cross.</p>
      <p>The youngster loves nothing more than long walks followed by plenty of cuddles.</p>
      <p>She’s extremely friendly and loves everyone she meets.</p>
      <p>However Rai needs to be in a home where she is the only pet and there are no young children.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Imani</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stunning Imani is now ready to put her paws up in her forever home. </p>
      <p>The German Shepherd needs to be the only pet in an adult-only household, with someone who has experience with the breed.</p>
      <p>She’s initially shy and nervous when she meets new people but after a few treats she’s your best friend.</p>
      <p>Imani will make the perfect companion for an active person who enjoys walks.</p>
      <p>She’s approximately two-years-old.</p>
      <p>Animal lovers living in and around Dudley are also urged to get in touch with Raven's Rescue if they would consider fostering a dog or cat while they wait for their forever homes.</p>
      <p>The charity will supply everything you need to make the four-legged friend at home, cover all vet bills and provide support 24/7 for the duration of their stay.</p>
      <p>Anyone who isn't in a position to take in a dog but would like to help the charity financially can do so by clicking <a href="http://ravensrescueuk.weebly.com/donate.html">here</a>.</p>
