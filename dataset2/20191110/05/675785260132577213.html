      <h1>Who won KSI vs Logan Paul? Fight result as YouTube stars clash in LA</h1>
      <h2>The two YouTube superstars met for a second time at the Staples Center after their draw in the first fight last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:47:16+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:47</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>KSI edged out Logan Paul by split decision in their huge rematch in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The YouTube superstars fought a dramatic second bout - but it was the Brit who was handed the decision by the narrowest of margins.</p>
      <p>After a majority draw in Manchester last year, KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - was given the verdict.</p>
      <p>Two scorecards scored it in his favour with scores of 57-54 and 56-55, whilst Logan Paul was handed a 56-55 verdict by the third judge.</p>
      <p>KSI dominated the first three rounds and recovered from a frantic fourth round which saw him knocked down by an uppercut but Paul deducted two points for a shot as he was heading to the ground.</p>

      <p>The highly-anticipated fight got off to a scrappy start with both fighters getting tangled up and the referee stepping in to clean things up several times.</p>
      <p>Few shots were landing cleanly with KSI swinging wildly with the overhand right, although he did strike a decent shot in the second round as he fought on the front foot.</p>
      <p>Logan Paul was twice on the canvas after losing his footing in round three, although neither were scored as knockdowns, as KSI continued to dominate the early exchanges.</p>

      <p>The American responded with a good right hand early in the fourth round as drama ensued later in the round.</p>
      <p>A vicious upper cut knocked KSI down, but Paul struck him with a blow to the back of the head as he was heading down leading to him being deducted two points by referee Jack Reese.</p>
      <p>The deduction left Paul needing a stoppage but also had KSI struggling for balance and appearing tired entering the last two rounds.</p>

      <p>Paul probably edged the closing stages, but KSI had done enough early on, with the two deducted points in the bizarre fourth round proving vital.</p>
      <p>On the undercard, Billy Joe Saunders knocked out Marcelo Esteban Coceres in round 11 to defend his WBO super-middleweight world title whilst Devin Haney outclassed Alfredo Santiago to defend his WBC world lightweight title.</p>
