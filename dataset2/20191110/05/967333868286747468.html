      <blockquote>"If we don't go through this impeachment inquiry, we're letting him get away with something [...] He has done something wrong, he has to pay for that. He has to be held accountable", <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/am-joy/watch/robert-de-niro-says-impeachment-inquiry-of-trump-must-proceed-73204293978">De Niro told MSNBC's Joy Reid</a> on Saturday morning.</blockquote>
      <p>De Niro, who has repeatedly criticized Trump and his policies, also slammed the former reality TV producer and star as a "fake president".</p>
      <blockquote>"He calls everything else fake because he knows he's fake", the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910221077119725-barack-obama-dines-with-hollywood-supporter-robert-deniro-as-work-on-netflix-contract-in-full-swing/">renowned actor said</a>, adding that Trump had spoiled America's relations with many countries, noting that the US needs a president that can repair "the damage that has been done".</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201909301076924901-fk-em-robert-de-niros-profane-tirade-labelling-trump-crazy-live-on-cnn-splits-netizens/">De Niro also hinted</a> at his picks for the US president: Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Former New York Mayor and high-profile billionaire Michael Bloomberg officially joined the 2020 Democratic presidential contest by meeting the registration deadline for the US state of Alabama primary on Friday.</p>
      <p>Trump is polling significantly behind several Democratic rivals in head-to-head match-ups, among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of the president, according to a recent poll released by The Washington Post and ABC News exactly one year before the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>The survey reveals a national shift in Trump approval, as during the summer, only former vice president Joe Biden had a clear lead over the president in the polls. The Washington Post suggested that the shift could be attributed to a greater number of independent voters swinging toward the Democratic vote.</p>
      <p>Trump has been consistently embroiled in political scandal since taking office, most recently leading House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry in September. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201905051074718613-de-niro-trump-attack-world-memory/">Trump is accused</a> of misusing the powers of his office by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political opponent Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Trump has denied the allegations, labeling the inquiry a political "witch hunt".</p>
