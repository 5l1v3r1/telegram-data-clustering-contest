      <p>With this, Messi equalled the record of Juventus' <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cristiano-Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as the former Real Madrid player has the same number to hat-tricks under his belt.</p>
      <p>Barcelona managed to thrash Celta Vigo by 4-1 with the help of the Argentine's massive contribution.</p>
