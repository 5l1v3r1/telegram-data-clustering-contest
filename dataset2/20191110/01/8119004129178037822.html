        <b>Jamie Vardy and James Maddison struck second-half goals as Leicester City beat an unimpressive Arsenal 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Saturday to move into second place in the Premier League.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leicester have 26 points and are above Chelsea on goal difference and one point ahead of champions Manchester City, who visit leaders Liverpool on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have now gone four games without a win in the league, and the latest defeat will add to the questions being asked of their decision to replace Arsene Wenger with Spaniard Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>It was an evenly balanced first half, although Arsenal's looseness in possession frequently handed Leicester opportunities.</p>
      <p>This Leicester team have also made a habit of upping their game after the interval, and that was again to be the case against the Gunners.</p>
      <p>Arsenal had a 55th-minute effort from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ruled out for offside after a VAR review and 13 minutes later Leicester struck.</p>
      <p>Vardy produced a characteristic, confident first-time finish from just inside the box after neat passing in the build-up from a confident Leicester side, clearly enjoying their football under Brendan Rodgers.</p>
      <p>The goal was Vardy's ninth in 10 appearances against Arsenal and he went close to a second in the 72nd minute but his low drive was kept out by Bernd Leno.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later, Vardy turned provider for the Foxes' second, poking the ball back to Maddison whose low strike whistled past Leno.</p>
      <p>Rodgers was quick to praise Vardy, the Premier League's top scorer with 11 goals so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>"It's firstly about giving him confidence. He is up there with the very, very top strikers in European football with what he brings to a team, his pressing," said the former Liverpool and Celtic manager.</p>
      <p>"We've allowed him to do essentially what he wants to do - how we play, being aggressive and playing quickly obviously suits him. But his finishing ability, how clinical he is, is absolutely phenomenal. That's a big testament to his concentration - when the opportunities come he's always ready."</p>
      <p>Emery said his side had shown better defensive organisation but said he accepted that people will question his work at the club.</p>
      <p>"I am speaking with the club to stay strong and recover. We also have young players who are growing up with us," he said.</p>
      <p>"I know we are receiving criticism, but I have done before and I have recovered. I accept all the criticism. It is normal. Today we did one step ahead being better defensively," added the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>"We need to recover our confidence. We need to be patient with some circumstances, and we are going to do that."</p>
