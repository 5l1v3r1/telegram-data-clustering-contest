      <h1>Combat veterans find camaraderie and healing in Alberta's outdoors</h1>

      <p>The Canadian convoy had just left the safety of Camp Julien near Kabul when Pte. Matthew Ritchie heard the detonation.</p>
      <p>“We knew it wasn’t a typical explosion or vehicle backfire,” said Ritchie, whose squad quickly mobilized to offer help.</p>
      <p>“We were on the scene less than three minutes after the explosion.”</p>
      <p>Ritchie recalls yelling at a soldier to escape the burning wreckage of the stricken vehicle.</p>
      <p>“But he was dead,” said the veteran, who was a member of the Royal Canadian Regiment tasked with providing security and stability in the area in the early days of Canada’s deployment in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The Jan. 27, 2004, suicide bombing cost Ritchie his friend Cpl. Jamie Murphy of Conception Harbour, N.L., while two other Canadian soldiers and several civilians were injured.</p>
      <p>Being witness to such carnage was traumatic enough, but it was the plight of civilians trapped by the war’s cruelty that left the deepest impression, he said.</p>
      <p>“What hit me was hardest was watching a child starve to death, said Ritchie, 36, of Hinton.</p>
      <p>Returning home from his 2003-04 tour of duty proved a psychological challenge he initially tried to deny.</p>
      <p>“I had trouble acclimatizing. I didn’t like to dwell on any of it and it took several years for me to understand I needed counselling,” said Ritchie.</p>
      <p>Re-integrating didn’t get any easier when images of apparel recalling his Afghan service that he’d posted online drew the wrath of those hostile to the military, he said.</p>
      <p>Those social media attacks were noticed by Penhold residents Ray McKay and Ray McKinnon, who stood up for the Afghan vet and invited him out to a parcel of wooded land in central Alberta to enjoy outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing and camping.</p>
      <p>“It meant a lot for someone to reach out to me, that we’re not forgotten that someone would say ‘we love you, come out and have some fun,’ ” said Ritchie.</p>
      <p>Since then, word has spread about the free outdoors excursions and host McKay figures more than 30 military veterans have taken up the offer.</p>
      <p>“They don’t get the recognition,” said cement finisher McKay, who adds he’s dug deep into his own pockets to fund the activities while also collecting donations.</p>
      <p>“Nobody in my family was in the wars but I just see what the government does to them, nobody really helps them.”</p>
      <p>The demand among the veteran community for that outdoor bonding reached a point where McKay’s outfit, dubbed Hoggin’ Alberta, needed more space.</p>
      <p>That led to a landowner last spring offering 32 hectares of property covered in spruce, poplar and tamarack near Caroline, about 175 kilometres northwest of Calgary, at a discount rental rate for the ex-warriors to use as they wish.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to see this has just gotten bigger and bigger,” said McKay, 53.</p>
      <p>“I give them the keys, they can come and go as they please.”</p>
      <p>Ex-paratrooper Will Shaw spent part of last summer clearing bush for a campsite on the Caroline land after being put in touch with McKay.</p>
      <p>He’d reached a low point, darkened by physical and psychological injuries related to his military service.</p>
      <p>“It was quiet out there, something I needed,” said Albertan Shaw, 31.</p>
      <p>“There’s enough space that it’s pretty free-wheeling out there for veterans.”</p>
      <p>He also credits McKay for “levelling me out” psychologically.</p>
      <p>“Because of him, I’m not off the tracks,” said Shaw.</p>
      <p>Knowing McKay’s a wild boar rancher, Shaw said he recently requested a sample of bacon harvested from that herd of Russian razorbacks.</p>
      <p>“I said ‘can I try your bacon’ and he gave me a whole pig,” he said.</p>
      <p>That’s been the theme of Hoggin’ Alberta for several years.</p>
      <p>“I received a bow but gave it away to somebody who needed it more than I did,” said Ritchie.</p>
      <p>“But it’s not all about the hunting, it’s the people you spend time with and I came out of it with a very good friend.”</p>
      <p>McKay and McKinnon’s efforts have also funneled money to veterans’ food banks and the Red Deer Ronald McDonald House which helps families of hospitalized kids.</p>
      <p>While he says funding all of those activities is always a challenge, McKay said he and Hoggin’ Alberta won’t give up making life more livable for those who’ve served.</p>
      <p>“Why stop? I have a tonne of veteran friends now,” he said.</p>
