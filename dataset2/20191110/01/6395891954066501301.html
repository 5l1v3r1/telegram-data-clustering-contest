      <p><b>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.Â (AP)</b> - Joe Burrrow sprinted toward the LSU fans to celebrate a monumental victory, and moments later was hoisted on the shoulders of two beefy teammates.</p>
      <p>They carried him only partway across the field. The ride isn't finished for Burrow and No. 1 LSU but the quarterback's masterful performance Saturday in a 46-41 victory over nemesis and second-ranked Alabama marked a huge step toward the Tigers' championship goals.</p>
      <p>Burrow passed for 393 yards and three touchdowns, answered challenge after challenge and helped end the eight-year string of futility that started with the national title game in January 2012. Now, their sights are set on another shot at national and Southeastern Conference championships.</p>
      <p>LSU coach Ed Orgeron said that for the first time he told his players pre-Alabama, "You're the better team."</p>
      <p>"We've finally got the tools that we need to beat those guys," Orgeron said. "To have a championship team, you've got to have a championship quarterback."</p>
      <p>The Tigers (9-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference, No. 2 CFP) are no longer second fiddle in the SEC West, or maybe in the playoff rankings. And Burrow stamped himself as the Heisman Trophy front-runner with a gutty performance when he answered every challenge from 'Bama.</p>
      <p>And the challenges were plentiful.</p>
      <p>That came as no surprise to Burrow.</p>
      <p>"I knew they were going to come back," he said. "That's Alabama on the other side, dynasty. I was really happy with the way we responded."</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide (8-1, 5-1, No. 3 CFP) rallied from a 33-13 halftime deficit to three times to pull within a touchdown in the fourth quarter. It kept going from game seemingly over to game on.</p>
      <p>The showdown lived up to its billing as a duel between two high-powered offenses and star quarterbacks with President Donald Trump attending. Tua Tagovailoa launched an 85-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith with 1:21 left after the Tigers' own scoring march.</p>
      <p>Justin Jefferson recovered the onside kick and LSU ran out the clock, finally triumphant over their SEC West nemesis.</p>
      <p>Burrow completed 31 of 39 passes. ran for 64 yards and was carried most of the way off the field by two teammates.</p>
      <p>The ride isn't over for LSU. Burrow said titles are what he was after when he transferred to LSU from Ohio State.</p>
      <p>"We're not done yet," the two-year starter said. "It's Game 9. We've got three more regular-season ones and the SEC championship. This was never our goal. We've got bigger goals than this."</p>
      <p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire ran for three touchdowns and caught a scoring pass, getting emotional on the sideline after a late touchdown that appeared once again to put the game away.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, 20 days removed from ankle surgery, was 21 of 40 for 418 yards and four touchdowns with an interception and a fumble. He was called a "game-time decision" all week, looked shaky early and appeared to be limping after the game, but he kept Alabama in it.</p>
      <p>Coach Nick Saban said Tagovailoa practiced all week without any issues.</p>
      <p>"He said he could play in the game, he wanted to play in the game and he thought he could go out and do a good job," Saban said. "I think he was a warrior in terms of what he did."</p>
      <p>Smith had 213 yards and a pair of touchdowns on seven catches for Alabama.</p>
      <p>LSU outgained Alabama by a slender 559-541. The Tigers had scored just 39 combined points in the last five meetings, but this was an entirely different offense.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>LSU: The Tigers have eight wins over Top 10 teams in the past two seasons, none bigger than this. Burrow &amp; Co. faced down a 101,000-plus mostly hostile fans and a strong pass rush. Scored two touchdowns in the final 26 seconds of the first half in a pivotal flurry that threatened to be overshadowed by the second half drama.</p>
      <p>Alabama: Didn't wilt under the adversity of a season previously characterized lopsided wins over teams currently unranked. Could be shut out of the playoffs barring some upsets elsewhere, mostly because of that schedule. Tagovailoa had a fumble and an interception in the first half.</p>
      <p>"We don't really control our own destiny but if we finish the season the right way, we can see where it takes us," Saban said.</p>
      <p>TOUGH TAILBACKS</p>
      <p>The running backs delivered. Edwards-Helaire ran for 103 yards on 20 carries and had nine catches for 77 yards. Alabama's Najee Harris, who didn't have a carry in the second quarter, finished with 146 rushing yards and a touchdown and added a receiving score.</p>

      <p>Alabama: At Mississippi State on Saturday.</p>
