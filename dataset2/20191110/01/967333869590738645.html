        <b>Astronomers have gotten a peek into the early stages of the formation of a supermassive galaxy caused by a collision between two smaller galaxies and have begun to detail the accompanying spectacular celestial phenomena.</b>

      <p>Space is often thought of as a cold, dead void with no atmosphere where everything either floats motionless or moves so fast that we won’t know about it until it takes us out. Recent astronomical observations, however, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201911061077239509-biggest-fish-in-space-pool-beijing-eyes-creating-first-earth-moon-economic-zone/">now offer proof</a> that cosmic mechanics can cause galactic winds that span billions of light years.</p>
      <p>Research published in the Natural Astronomy journal details observations of a distant galaxy called SDSS J211824.06+001729.4, nicknamed Makani after the Hawaiian word for ‘wind,’ made using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager. Makani is actually not one, but two galaxies which collided billions of years ago. </p>
      <p>When galaxies collide, enormous amounts of gas become compress, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201911061077233763-voyager-2-sends-back-first-messages-from-interstellar-space---study/">leading to the creation</a> of massive new stars – a phenomenon known as a ‘starburst.’ The collision itself, the star formation and exploding supernovas, create massive outbursts of hot ionized gas, notes astrophysicist Alison Coil of UC San Diego.</p>

      <p>​And by ‘massive,’ they mean 4,900 square kiloparsecs, or roughly 52-billion square light-years. That is a lot of gas.</p>
      <p>What makes it more remarkable is that the ionized gas <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911061077233332-us-military-developing-tech-to-beam-focused-solar-energy-to-earth-from-space---report/">is very hot oxygen</a>, astronomers assert, adding that gas temperatures can reach up to 10,000 degrees Kelvin (about 9726.85 degrees Celsius or 9726.85 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

      <p>​There are two ongoing outbursts in Makani, which astronomers believe formed at different times. Shaped like hourglasses, the two energy sources are expanding into space at a whopping 1,400 kilometres per second and 2,100 kilometres per second each.</p>
      <p>"The earlier outflow has flowed to large distances from the galaxy, while the fast, recent outflow has not had time to do so," said physicist David Rupke of Rhodes College.</p>
      <p>According to Rupke, the two outbursts suck in galactic matter as they move through space, and currently have captured huge amounts.</p>
      <blockquote>"And it's moving a lot of it - at least one to 10 percent of the visible mass of the entire galaxy - at very high speeds, thousands of kilometres per second."</blockquote>
      <p>Astronomers say this is one of the first insights into the formation process of a so-called circumgalactic medium around a massive galaxy.</p>
