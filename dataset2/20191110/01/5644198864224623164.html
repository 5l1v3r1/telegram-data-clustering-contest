      <p>BURNLEY, England: West Ham United's winless streak in the Premier League extended to six games as they suffered a 3-0 defeat by a Burnley side inspired by talented teenage winger Dwight McNeil on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Burnley, who had lost their last three matches, went ahead in the 11th minute when McNeil swung in a deep corner, James Tarkowski snuck round the back and headed to Ashley Barnes who poked home.</p>

      <p>The Clarets thought they had a second in the 36th minute when McNeil whipped in a superb cross which Chris Wood met with a thundering header but to the anger of the home crowd, the VAR review found evidence of off-side.</p>
      <p>Burnley did double their lead a minute before the break, and it was no surprise that McNeil was again the provider.</p>
      <p>A throw out from West Ham's shaky Spanish keeper Roberto Jimenez to defender Fabian Balbuena was intercepted by the Burnley winger who burst forward before delivering a low cross which was expertly turned in by Wood.</p>
      <p>Jimenez was at fault again for the third in the 54th minute, flapping at an Ashley Westwood corner which he managed to punch into his own net.</p>
      <p>But the Spanish keeper did well to ensure that Burnley did not add to the punishment with a series of fine saves as Sean Dyche's side threatened to run rampant.</p>
      <p>West Ham's troubles were compounded by the loss of Mark Noble and Manuel Lanzini to injury and midfielder Declan Rice conceded they had been clearly second best.</p>
      <p>"We were bullied all over the pitch," said the England international. "Burnley were winning everything. It is not good enough.</p>
      <p>“There is a real buzz around the place during the week but it when it gets to the game and we go 1-0 down our heads drop. We need to do the basics – the simple five-yard passing, the tackling," he said.</p>
      <p>Alarm bells had been ringing among Burnley fans after last week's 3-0 loss at Sheffield United but Dyche said his players had given the perfect response.</p>
      <p>"That was our alter ego - last week we weren’t even close to a performance. We were way off our mark. Today it came flooding back in, The edge we played with, the organisation, the shape and belief," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think our performances levels have been generally good, we had a blip last weekend, which has fortunately proved to be a blip, but the players’ mentality was spot on and last week it wasn’t</p>
      <p>"Today we’ve delivered and got what we deserved," Dyche added.</p>
