      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 10 — Malay daily <i>Utusan Malaysia</i> is set to restart its operations in early 2020 after its surprise shut down, Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Redzuan Yusof said yesterday.</p>
      <p><i>New Straits Times</i> reported Redzuan explaining to voters of the Tanjung Piai by-election that the relaunched daily will then help to disseminate information on the current government’s initiatives and policies.</p>
      <p>“<i>Utusan</i> is still around. It will be re-launched, God willing, around the New Year.</p>
      <p>“[<i>Utusan</i>] will help disseminate information on the [government’s] policy implementation, some of which have been done and some are being carried out right now,” he said during an event in Pontian, Johor.</p>
      <p><i>Utusan Malaysia</i> was forced to close its doors after 80 years on October 9, after facing many years of financial crisis which even led to its workers protest it over unpaid wages.</p>
      <p><i>Utusan Malaysia</i> began operating before Malaysia’s independence in 1939.</p>
      <p>It was first published as <i>Utusan Melayu</i>, using the Jawi medium, before the current Romanised version began publication on September 1, 1967.</p>
      <p>As of December 2018, approximately 800 employees had accepted the voluntary separation scheme. However, their payments were also delayed.</p>
      <p>The Utusan Group, which publishes <i>Utusan Malaysia</i> and <i>Kosmo!</i>, is currently on PN17 status on the Malaysian Stock Exchange after failing to pay an outstanding debt of nearly RM1.2 million to two banks.</p>
