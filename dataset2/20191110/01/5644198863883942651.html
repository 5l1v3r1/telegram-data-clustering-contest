      <p>BERLIN: RB Leipzig cruised past hosts Hertha Berlin 4-2 on Saturday (Nov 9) to provisionally go second in the Bundesliga table, before champions Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund later.</p>
      <p>Maximilian Mittelstaedt put the home side ahead in the 32nd with a thundering shot, but Leipzig's Timo Werner responded with a penalty six minutes later before Marcel Sabitzer turned the game around on the stroke of halftime with a deflected shot.</p>

      <p>Kevin Kampl then timed his run down the left wing to perfection to beat the offside trap and drill in Leipzig's third in the 86th minute.</p>
      <p>Werner then tapped in his 11th goal of the campaign in stoppage time before Davie Selke pulled one back for the hosts seconds later.</p>
      <p>Leipzig are on 21 points, with Dortmund on 19 and Bayern a further point behind. Leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach entertain Werder Bremen on Sunday.</p>
