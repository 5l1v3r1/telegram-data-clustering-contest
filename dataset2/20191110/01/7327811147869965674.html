      <p>RANDALL'S ISLAND, New York (WABC) -- The FDNY held a graduation ceremony for nearly 60 EMTs at the FDNY Training Academy on Randall's Island.</p>
      <p>In an emergency, it may be their faces you see first.</p>
      <p>Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said, "last year alone our members responded to more than a million and a half medical emergencies."</p>
      <p>Now, these 58 new graduates from the FDNY Paramedic Basic program are hitting the streets after spending years as EMTs.</p>
      <p>"You are now a part of an elite group," Chief of Department John Sudnik said. "You are the highest trained medical responders in the busiest and best medical service in the world."</p>
      <p>These paramedics went through nine months of vigorous field rotations and clinical internships to provide the highest level of pre-hospital care.</p>
      <p>"I saw paramedics out in the field and I wanted to do what they did," paramedic Stephen Hershenfeld said.</p>
      <p>This year paramedic Stephen Hershenfeld, a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, walked across the stage with Veteran's Day on his mind.</p>

      <p>"It's a sober day ... those still recovering from PTSD, injuries from war ... we still remember," Hershenfeld said.</p>
      <p>Hershenfeld has taken what he's learned during his deployment into the paramedic classroom to help the people of New York.</p>
      <p>"It streamlined me to be more disciplined in my studies and to think outside of the box," Hershenfeld said.</p>
      <p>"Each of you is committing to saving others as well as providing outstanding medical care," Chief of EMS Lillian Bonsignore said. "I believe this job is a calling and we are so grateful it has called you."</p>
      <p>It's a calling for Hershenfeld and 57 others to take on a great responsibility.</p>
      <p>"It's the coolest job in the world," Hershenfeld said.</p>
      <p>The graduates will be assigned to various units throughout New York City.</p>
