      <h1>New oil field found in Iran with estimated 50 billion barrels, says president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:44:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Iran has discovered a new oil field in the country’s south with an estimated 50 billion barrels of crude oil, its president said.</p>
      <p>The find could boost the country’s proven reserves by a third as it struggles to sell energy abroad amid US sanctions.</p>
      <p>The announcement by Hassan Rouhani comes as Iran faces crushing American sanctions after the US pulled out of its nuclear deal with world powers last year.</p>
      <p>Mr Rouhani made the announcement in a speech in the desert city of Yazd. He said the field was located in Iran’s southern Khuzestan province, home to its crucial oil industry.</p>
      <p>He added that 50 billion barrels would be added to Iran’s proven reserves of some 150 billion.</p>
      <p>Proven reserves are those that are commercially feasible to extract.</p>
      <p>The new oil field could become Iran’s second-largest field after one containing 65 billion barrels in Ahvaz.</p>
