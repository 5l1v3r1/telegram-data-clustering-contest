      <p>Cambodian opposition figure Sam Rainsy arrived in Kuala Lumpur airport on Saturday afternoon after boarding a flight from Paris, where he has been living for more than four years.</p>
      <p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation spokesperson Koy Kuong said on Saturday that Cambodia respected the decision of the Malaysian government in dealing with a request from Phnom Penh.</p>
      <p>“Cambodian has already talked with all the governments of Asean countries and informed them of the nine convicted fugitives. So we won’t do another follow-up request.</p>
      <p>"I have heard that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has said he would not interfere in the internal affairs of another country and would not allow any group to use Malaysian territory to carry out activities against other countries,” Kuong said.</p>
      <p>He said Cambodia respected the decisions of its Asean neighbours.</p>
      <p>“Cambodia always respects the independent decisions and internal procedures of other countries which have the same principle – that is, we don’t interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
      <p>“No matter what they decide, our relations with all Asean friends will remain as good as they normally are. We are all working together to make Asean unified and prosperous,” Kuong said.</p>
