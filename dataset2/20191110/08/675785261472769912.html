      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: The parents of Oscar Davies say they've waited two years for an inquest into the tragic death of their son and still don't have the answers they want</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:31:30+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:31</time> by <a rel="author">Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>A devastating photograph shows a couple holding a tiny coffin for their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> who died after being born with his umbilical cord wrapped twice around his neck.</p>
      <p>Laura Stanley and her fiance Tod have shared the poignant photograph two years after the death of their precious son Oscar Davies after an inquest into his death.</p>
      <p>The grieving couple are seen looking down at the white coffin while huddled close together, as they say 'every day has been a struggle since'.</p>
      <p>Leaving the hospital with 'empty arms' is the hardest thing they've ever had to do, Laura and Tod said.</p>
      <p>They say they still haven't got the answers they've waited two years for as an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inquests">inquest</a> at Exeter’s County Hall yesterday heard different opinions of what happened.</p>
      <p>A coroner said: "It’s simply a common sense finding, given cord compression is on the balance of probability the most likely positive feature, that earlier delivery would have led to a potential better outcome."</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to Oscar after the inquest, his parents said: "Since losing our baby boy nearly two years ago now, every day has been a struggle to keep going. Leaving that hospital with empty arms is the hardest thing we've ever had to do."</p>
      <p>"Hearing the inquest yesterday - which we've waited nearly two years for - still hasn't given us any answers as such as two doctors both had different opinions about whether a C-section should have been done earlier or not, and therefore the outcome may have been different.</p>
      <p>"We really hope no-one else has to go through what we have been through over the last two years.</p>
      <p>"Oscar is forever missed and will always be loved and never forgotten."</p>
      <p>Oscar's parents have had to wait two years for an inquest into their son’s death which was held yesterday, <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/grieving-mum-dad-told-baby-3519064">Devon Live reports.</a></p>

      <p>It concluded that although the labour had been carefully monitored, the opinion of a senior consultant was not sought when irregularities in his heartbeat were detected.</p>
      <p>Had it have done, the coroner stated the outcome could possibly have been different.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard first time mum Laura, of Holsworthy, went into labour prematurely at 34 weeks after her waters broke on December 19, 2017, and was admitted into North Devon District Hospital (NDDH).</p>
      <p>Both Miss Stanley and her unborn baby had their hearts constantly monitored up until he was born the following morning at 4.56am and was not breathing. Despite resuscitation attempts he was pronounced dead shortly after.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Miss Stanley said on behalf of her and her fiancé Tod: “We are still very upset and confused about what happened to Oscar. We do not feel we have got answers about what happened to him and why he died.”</p>
      <p>She added they had concerns about a ‘heated disagreement’ between the midwife and a doctor which did not give them confidence about the treatment given.</p>
      <p>Miss Stanley said: “We feel there was a disagreement in treatment and suggests uncertainty in the management of the labour.”</p>
      <p>She told how they believed doctors should have acted sooner for Oscar to be born.</p>
      <p>She said: “A caesarean section should have been done earlier and the outcome would have been different.”</p>
      <p>Miss Stanley told how Tod was still haunted by the image of seeing Oscar with the cord around his neck when he was born.</p>
      <p>She said: “We were told the cause of his death was the cord around his neck. Then later we were told it was not the cause of his death.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I feel we have not been told the whole story by NDDH and there are inconsistencies.</p>
      <p>“His death could have been prevented. We want to know the truth and we would not want any other parent to go through what we have.”</p>

      <p>The inquest heard how Oscar’s heart rate kept decelerating and recovering, but got worse the longer Miss Stanley was in labour.</p>
      <p>Midwife and labour ward coordinator Kerry Causer-Rowe recalled how Miss Stanley was admitted at 10pm and after detecting a ‘suspicious’ heart rate for Oscar, she was reviewed by a doctor at 2.35am, by which time Miss Stanley was 4cm dilated.</p>
      <p>She recalled the locum doctor disagreed and said overall it was normal, but denied it had been a heated discussion.</p>
      <p>She said: “I had my opinion about what I thought the cardiotocography (CTG) had been. Sometimes you have to get your opinion across and I’m not frightened to say that.</p>
      <p>“I never left there thinking I’ve had an argument. It was a shock when it was brought to my attention during the internal investigation.”</p>
      <p>She added despite the disagreement, she was happy with the outcome because the monitoring plan put in place was the one she wanted.</p>
      <p>Mrs Causer-Rowe told how that after returning from a break, Miss Stanley had gone into theatre and she was present when Oscar was born.</p>
      <p>She recalled how the cord was wrapped tight twice around his neck, but described him as looking ‘pink’ in appearance.</p>
      <p>She said: “He was not making any respiratory effort at all.”</p>
      <p>The midwife added there had been no clinical indication the cord was around the baby’s neck or for the caesarean to have been carried out earlier.</p>
      <p>Mrs Causer-Rowe said: “Genuinely I believe the care she got was the right appropriate care at the right time.”</p>
      <p>Midwife Wendy Benham, who took over Miss Stanley's care from Mrs Causer-Rowe during her break at 3.45am, told how Oscar’s heart rate began to decelerate just before 4.15am and called for a doctor who ‘came almost instantly’.</p>
      <p>The decision for Miss Stanley to go to theatre was made around 4.30am.</p>
      <p>The locum doctor who had seen Miss Stanley at intervals during her pregnancy also denied there had been a heated discussion between him and Mrs Causer-Rowe, and said he had given his opinion on the heart beat trace.</p>
      <p>Recalling when he became concerned for the baby’s safety, Dr Ngum said: “While I was last in the room the baby’s heart beat dropped and was not coming back to the base line so I called for a C-section.</p>
      <p>“He came out floppy and a very good colour; pink. The baby did not breathe or cry immediately.”</p>
      <p>Independent specialist evidence was provided by Dr Keith Duncan who does not work for the trust.</p>
      <p>Having studied the CTG results, the consultant obstetrician concluded it indicated cord compression due to a reoccurring pattern of decelerations which started around 2.10am.</p>
      <p>He said: “At that stage I would have deferred to a consultant on call and considered in the context of the clinical picture of doing a caesarean.”</p>
      <p>Dr Duncan added he was ‘surprised’ Oscar could not be resuscitated and concluded: “I think the baby should have been delivered earlier, but I don’t know if it would have made a difference to the outcome.”</p>
      <p>Further information was provided by consultant paediatrician Dr Andrew Arend.</p>
      <p>He reported Oscar was blue, not pink at birth, and that he had initially told his parents he died due to cord compression but later said it should not be assumed until the cause was properly investigated.</p>
      <p>However, Dr Arend said due to what he knew now it was more likely than not that cord compression led to Oscar’s death, but that it might not be the only cause.</p>
      <p>A post mortem examination confirmed the cause of Oscar’s death was perinatal asphyxia.</p>
      <p>Paediatric pathologist Dr Andrew Bamber said the most significant finding was a lack of oxygen at some point during labour and delivery.</p>
      <p>He confirmed Oscar was a normal developed baby and although he had a genetic abnormality it would not have caused problems in delivery and would possibly only have been noticeable in his behaviour later on in his life.</p>

      <p>Dr Bamber told how lots of babies are delivered with the umbilical cord around their neck but stated he detected possible problems with the cord before labour.</p>
      <p>It was added that a procedure not carried out at birth by the midwife, who was helping with resuscitation, meant an umbilical cord gas analysis was not possible which could have provided further answers.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard the trust had carried out its own serious incident investigation which concluded Miss Stanley was attended to in a prompt and professional manner, the decisions were made at ‘clinically appropriate times’ and all protocols were followed.</p>
      <p>Recording a conclusion of natural causes, coroner Lydia Brown said: “It was a normal pregnancy until Laura’s waters broke when she then became high risk. There were prompt assessments and good availability of staff, equipment and theatre time.</p>
      <p>“There was not a request for senior consultant input which may have allowed further interpretation of a difficult CTG.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “In context of it being a high risk birth and mortality outcomes it was a matter where further senior scrutiny would only have been beneficial. That’s not to say what that would have shown or decisions which may have then been taken.</p>
      <p>“I am very mindful of the different opinions and interpretations in this court today. From all the evidence, an earlier decision to go to caesarean section is likely to have been carried out just as promptly and with all the support as when it did take place.</p>
      <p>“It’s simply a common sense finding, given cord compression is on the balance of probability the most likely positive feature, that earlier delivery would have led to a potential better outcome.”</p>
