      <h1>Bernie Sanders laughs at idea Bezos urged Bloomberg to run: ‘That’s real class solidarity’</h1>

      <p>Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, I-Vt., laughed so hard Saturday when he learned Amazon CEO <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> had urged <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> months ago to run for president that Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, D-N.Y., had to step in to speak, according to a report.</p>
      <p>“Of course!” Ocasio-Cortez told the Des Moines Register. “They’ve got class solidarity. The billionaires are looking out for each other.”</p>
      <p>She added that Bill Gates being seemingly more willing to vote for President Trump than a Democrat shows how adamant billionaires are about protecting their “excess.”</p>

      <p>At that point Sanders interjected.</p>
      <p>“Jeff Bezos, worth $150 billion, supporting Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth only $50 billion, that's real class solidarity,” he told the <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2019/11/09/sanders-aoc-react-bloomberg-presidential-bid/2550911001/">Register</a>. “I’m impressed by that grassroots movement.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Jeff Bezos, worth $150 billion, supporting Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth only $50 billion, that's real class solidarity. I’m impressed by that grassroots movement.”<cite>— Bernie Sanders</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Sanders has been critical of Jeff Bezos in the past, over the treatment of his employees, and takes credit for getting Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour last year.</p>

      <p>Sanders’ and Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposed Medicare-for-all plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy have concerned billionaires like Bloomberg and Bezos.</p>
      <p>At a rally in Iowa earlier Saturday, Sanders told the crowd Bloomberg “ain’t gonna buy this election!”</p>
      <p>“You’re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada," Sanders said. "Yes, we don’t have a super PAC and I’m not worth $52 billion.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York City, qualified Friday to get on the Democratic presidential primary ballot in Alabama.</p>
