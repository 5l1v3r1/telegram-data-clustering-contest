      <h1>Renault HBC Compact SUV Imagined Ahead Of Auto Expo 2020 Debut</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:15:55+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://gaadiwaadi.com/author/pranavsiddharth0303/" target="_blank">Team GaadiWaadi</a></address>
      <h3>Renault HBC, the Kwid-based compact SUV, will likely debut at Auto Expo 2020 and will be sold in a price range of Rs 6-7.5 lakh, thereby making it the cheapest SUV in the country</h3>
      <p>After the launch of the Renault Triber, which is essentially a Kwid-based low-cost MPV, the Indian subsidiary of the French carmaker will soon launch a low-cost SUV that will also be based on the entry-level hatchback. The upcoming model has been internally dubbed as the Renault HBC and has been imagined in a new artistic rendering.</p>
      <p>The Renault HBC will feature a distinctive SUV-ish appearance that will share little with that of the Kwid. That said, the design of its front-end will be crafted using the same styling philosophy as that of the Kwid facelift. The headlamps will be found at a low-set position near the bumper, while sleek LED DRLs will be found at a higher position.</p>
      <p>The multi-slat 3D grille will be infused with chrome and the side profile will feature five-spoke machine-cut alloy wheels to further uplift the premium appearance. The wheel arches will feature black plastic cladding to further add to the macho appeal of the Renault HBC SUV.</p>

      <p>Underpinning the Renault HBC will be the same CMF-A+ platform that forms the base of the Triber. Basically a derivative of the CMF-A architecture of the Kwid, the new platform will enable the HBC to duck under the four-metre mark in overall length.</p>
      <p>In all likelihood, the Renault HBC will have a solid price advantage over the likes of Maruti Vitara Brezza, Hyundai Venue and Tata Nexon. Prices of the new car could start at Rs 6 lakh and go all the way to Rs 7.5 lakh for the top model.</p>
      <p>Powering the Renault HBC will be an updated version of the 1.0-litre, three-cylinder engine that powers the Triber. The small capacity engine will be BSVI-compliant will offer a maximum power of 72 PS and a peak torque of 96 Nm. Transmission options will include a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed AMT automatic unit.</p>
