      <h1>Liverpool vs Manchester City odds: Best bets for all Sunday's Premier League games</h1>
      <h2>Expert betting tips for Anfield title-race showdown, plus mid-table action with Manchester United vs Brighton and the Midlands derby</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Hankin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/alex-hankin/</a></address>
      <p>Bet that VAR and the Anfield factor can find the sweet spot for punters this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The visit of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> (4.30pm) is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s seventh domestic home game of the season. They’ve scored a penalty in four of the previous six.</p>
      <p>Given a murky set of wider forecasts, it’s tough graft for punters.</p>
      <p>So take the <b>6/1 (Bet365) ‘Liverpool score a penalty’</b> , put your feet up and enjoy.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp reckons he’s working too hard. He should try my other gig, trotting behind the Rees-Moggs with the bucket and shovel.</p>
      <p>Runs in the family. And there’s been a Hankin mopping 'em up best we can since Tudor times.</p>
      <p>I’ve got chronic ‘dung lung’ and blisters like fried eggs, but, as Master Jacob always says, I’m not very clever so it hardly matters does it?</p>
      <p>Magical Mo Salah has been doing a lot of thankless spade work recently too.</p>
      <p>His luck will turn - the <b>7/4 (Fred) ‘Salah anytime scorer’</b> is too big.</p>
      <p>If you think <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> were unlucky in the 1-0 defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> you’re flying in the face of the maths.</p>
      <p>The eggheads behind ‘expected goal stats’ say United WERE luckless and shortchanged at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> .</p>
      <p>But at Bournemouth they produced what the data boffins classify as ‘sod all’, and were paid in full.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> ’s visit (2pm) rates as a test, but Marcus Rashford is finding plenty of the right answers now, with goals in five of his last seven games for club and country.</p>
      <p>The <b>15/2 (Paddy) ‘Rashford scores two or more’</b> just about adds up as a fun longshot.</p>
      <p>The first rule of Midlands fight club is back the DRAW, bab.</p>
      <p>Take the <b>11/4 (Sky, BetVic) for a stalemate</b> when Aston Villa go to Wolves (2pm) - the Wanderers’ record on their returns from Europa land reads W1 D5 L1 so far.</p>
      <p>But chuck in an scorer longshot who looks a good fit for Villa’s aerial wobbles. Big <b>Romain Saiss is worth a nibble at 15/2 (Paddy, Hills) ‘anytime scorer’.</b></p>
