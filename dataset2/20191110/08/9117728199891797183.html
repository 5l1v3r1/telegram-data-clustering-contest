      <h1>W series winner Jaime Chadwick says a Formula 1 seat seems "further away"</h1>

        <b>The W Series was formed to give female racing drivers a platform to move closer to Formula 1. However, the winner of the inaugural competition, Jaime Chadwick, believes an opportunity for a future F1 drive seems "further away" than ever before. The 21-year-old says she isn't rushing and still has plenty of time. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The British driver will make her return to the W Series when the championship restarts to defend her crown. Even though Chadwick experienced plenty of success and positive press for her performances, she feels as if a seat in F1 has moved further away but that doesn't mean it's all doom and gloom. </p>

      <p><i>"To be completely honest, further away. Not in a bad way, in a really refreshing way, I feel I know what I need to now learn in the next few years. I’m not going to rush that. I’m not going to try and cheat it,"</i> Chadwick told <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-wseries-chadwick/chadwick-feels-f1-is-further-away-the-closer-she-gets-idUKKBN1XH2YW">Reuters</a>. </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I need the time to develop and if I get to Formula 1, I want to be the best possible driver to make the mark I need to make."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Chadwick often sat in the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> garage during the 2019 F1 season as a development driver. She never got an opportunity to drive the Williams car but she might be one of those drivers who benefit from the 2021 rule which forces teams to use drivers with under two Grands Prix under their belts in practice sessions. </p>

      <p><i>“In terms of getting in the car, that’s an ongoing discussion. We’re sort of pushing as hard as we can but we’ll see. If we can continue the relationship into next year, and if I can continue to do the best possible job in the sim, then that hopefully gives me a justifiable reason to potentially test the car at a future date,"</i> she added. </p>
