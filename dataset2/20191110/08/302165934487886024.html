      <p>PARIS, Nov 10 — Oscar-winner Roman Polanski is considering taking legal action against a French newspaper that published allegations from a former actress that the acclaimed director raped her, his lawyer said Sunday.</p>
      <p>Valentine Monnier on Friday became the latest woman to accuse the Polish-French film director of rape, telling <i>Le Parisien </i>she was attacked in 1975, aged 18, at Polanski’s chalet in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad.</p>
      <p>“Mr Polanski disputes in the strongest terms this rape accusation,” lawyer Herve Temime told AFP in a statement.</p>
      <p>“We are working on the legal action to bring against this publication,” he said referring to the <i>Le Parisien</i> newspaper.</p>
      <p>Monnier, who appeared in several films in the 1980s, said she had finally decided to speak out as Polanski’s new film about an error of justice was due to come out.</p>
      <p><i>An Officer and A Spy (J’accuse) </i>hits cinemas in France on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Polanski fled to France from the United States in 1978 after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>US efforts to extradite him, including from Switzerland and Poland, have so far failed. — AFP</p>
