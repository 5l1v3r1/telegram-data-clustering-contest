      <h2>Logan Paul lost to rival KSI in their grudge match - and younger brother Jake Paul claimed the sport is "rigged"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:08:42+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:08</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jake Paul claims the rematch between brother Logan Paul and KSI was "rigged" as he slammed boxing in an x-rated rant.</p>
      <p>Paul was beaten by the narrowest of margins in a split decision after being deducted two points without prior warning for hitting KSI on the ground after a knockdown in round four.</p>
      <p>That decision made all the difference when it went to the scorecards, with one of the three judges at ringside still scoring the money-spinning bout in favour of the American.</p>
      <p>And younger brother Jake, who was sat at ringside sporting a replica WBC belt and claiming to be "WBC amateur champion" after beating KSI's younger brother on the undercard of their first clash last year, was furious with the outcome.</p>
      <p>He accused KSI of dining with DAZN chief Joe Markowski the day before the point and claimed the sport is corrupt.</p>

      <p>Addressing reporters in footage captured by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wffbRdBnmWE&amp;feature=emb_logo">iFL TV</a> , Jake Paul said: "With that decision, that's just b*******.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, I've been in this sport for a year now and, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but all this s*** is f****** rigged.</p>
      <p>"You see people wining and dining each other, people at the Staples Center. Who was at the Staples Center last night with KSI? Joe Markowski.</p>

      <p>"This sport is rigged, that's for sure.</p>
      <p>"The short amount of time I've been here, I've heard multiple stories about people paying stuff off, choosing fights, what time people sign contracts.</p>
      <p>"It's not an excuse, I'm just saying."</p>

      <p>Immediately after the fight, Logan Paul declared his intention to "contest the commission" after his defeat.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a legitimate knockdown," Paul said. "I didn't get a warning.</p>
      <p>"I got two points taken away from me and that's the reason I lost tonight. I would love to contest the commission because I think I should have got a warning. I don't think it was fair at all."</p>
