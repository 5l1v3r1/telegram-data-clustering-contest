      <h1>Granit Xhaka blasts Arsenal fans for 'bringing bad mood' to team</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka hasn't appeared for Arsenal since he reacted badly to fans sarcastically cheering his substitution - where he cupped his ears, told them to "f*** off" and took his shirt off</h2>

      <p>Granit Xhaka has accused Arsenal fans of bringing "restlessness" and a "bad mood" to the Emirates Stadium in the wake of his bust up with supporters.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Xhaka told Gunners fans to "f*** off" following an altercation during the north London side's Premier League clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland international angrily reacted after he was jeered and sarcastically cheered as he was substituted - before he gesticulated, cupped his ear, swore loudly, whipped off his shirt and stormed down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>He has since been stripped of the captaincy and has yet to return to the pitch - with a January transfer looking increasingly likely.</p>

      <p>And a move appears inevitable following an interview in his homeland, as Xhaka described his feelings at the incident and hit out and fans.</p>
      <p>"When my shirt number lit up on the board of the fourth official and then broke jealous jubilation of their own fans, that hit me very much and stirred up," Xhaka told Swiss newspaper Blick.</p>
      <p>"It was very painful and frustrating.</p>
      <p>"For me, this reaction is still incomprehensible, especially in this vehemence and how extremely hostile I was here.</p>

      <p>"Since I can remember, the fans are an integral part of my sport.</p>
      <p>"And I have a lot of respect from the beginning for the commitment and hardships fans take to help us players.</p>
      <p>"Justifiable criticism of them makes you grow as an athlete.</p>
      <p>"And the power and energy that they put into the game makes every athlete love football even more. I feel like part of a big football family.</p>
      <p>"But when you get scolded by this very footballing family in times when you are already being attacked massively, it hurts a lot.</p>
      <p>"By that I do not mean that I can not stand criticism. If I and the team do not play well, we have to listen to it and work on it.</p>
      <p>"But if you offend and insult your own captain, bring restlessness and bad mood into the team you actually support.</p>
      <p>"That makes no sense to me and weakens the cohesion."</p>
