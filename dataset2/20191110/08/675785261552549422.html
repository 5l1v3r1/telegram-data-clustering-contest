      <p>Beaten boxer Logan Paul blamed his defeat to KSI on illness - and claimed he "thought he was going to die".</p>
      <p>Paul suffered a points defeat via split decision in the lucrative rematch between the YouTube stars at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The American was the pre-fight favourite but could not come out on top in their second encounter having drawn in Manchester as amateurs last year.</p>
      <p>And Paul revealed he "woke up sick" and was far from at his best as a result.</p>
      <p>Paul told BBC Sounds: "My gameplan kind of went out the window. That was the worst I've performed out of every sparring session I've had, ever.</p>

      <p>"You can hear in my voice right now I'm sick, I'm nasally. I woke up sick, I've been sneezing all day and I tried to ignore that but it took probably 30-50% out of me.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if I was trying to conserve energy, because I thought I was going to die because of my lungs, I don't know."</p>
      <p>Paul was also unhappy with a crucial points deduction without prior warning which cost him victory.</p>

      <p>He was deemed to have hit KSI on the deck after knocking him down with an uppercut in round four.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a legitimate knockdown," Paul said. "I didn't get a warning.</p>
      <p>"I got two points taken away from me and that's the reason I lost tonight. I would love to contest the commission because I think I should have got a warning. I don't think it was fair at all."</p>
      <p>His younger brother, Jake Paul, also accused boxing of being rigged in an x-rated rant.</p>

      <p>"With that decision, that's just b*******," he said.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the day, I've been in this sport for a year now and, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but all this s*** is f****** rigged.</p>
      <p>"You see people wining and dining each other, people at the Staples Center. Who was at the Staples Center last night with KSI? Joe Markowski.</p>
      <p>"This sport is rigged, that's for sure."</p>
