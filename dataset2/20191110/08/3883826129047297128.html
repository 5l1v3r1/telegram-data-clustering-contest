        <b>Billy Joe Saunders says he wants to fight Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez but admitted there was "something missing" as he laboured to a knockout win over Marcelo Esteban Coceres in Los Angeles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Saunders, 30, floored Argentina's Coceres three times in the 11th round, prompting a stoppage, to defend his WBO world super-middleweight title.</p>
      <p>The Briton, on his US debut, conceded "it wasn't a world class performance".</p>
      <p>"Canelo may look at that and think now is the time to get me," said Saunders.</p>
      <p>"I knocked him out when I knew I had to. I thought 'you have to stop him' and I stopped him.</p>
      <p>"I knew I had to dig very deep. I am not one to make excuses. I came over here five days out, nine hours' time difference, I haven't slept right for five days.</p>
      <p>"Tonight wasn't a world-class performance, it was a world class finish but not a world class performance. That shows you what sort of a fighter I am.</p>
      <p>"When someone is talking abut Canelo and you are fighting an Argentinean, you don't look past him but one eye is off. I have to look at the performance. I was trying to get my feet working, it was like I was dipped in glue. There was something missing, maybe it was the travel, I don't know."</p>
      <h3>'Canelo and rivals may fancy their chances'</h3>

      <p>Saunders' win arrived on the undercard of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/50364354">KSI's victory over YouTube rival Logan Paul,</a> while elsewhere on the card American lightweight <b>Devin Haney</b> defended his WBC world title with a points win over Alfredo Santiago.</p>
      <p>A solid left hook and right uppercut in the 11th round from Saunders floored his rival and helped secure a 29th win from as many contests as Coceres fell to defeat for the first time in a 30-fight career.</p>
      <p>Promoter Eddie Hearn said he felt Saunders was at risk of defeat had he not found the knockout, adding: "He showed a lot of heart to come back from that as his tank was empty, he was flat."</p>
      <p>Saunders defended his world title in the 168lb super-middleweight division for the first time and now hopes to secure a shot at Mexico's Alvarez, who holds versions of a world title at middleweight, super-middleweight and light-heavyweight.</p>
      <p>"Canelo Alvarez is the one I want next," added Saunders. "I can fluctuate at middleweight and super-middleweight. The bigger fights are at super-middleweight. All the super-middleweights will look at that performance and think 'we haven't got a lot to worry about there so let's get him in the ring'."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on Saturday, Bulgaria's <b>Kubrat Pulev</b> fought for the first time since being suspended by the California State Athletic Commission for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/47744247">"forcefully" kissing a female reporter on the lips.</a></p>
      <p>The 38-year-old landed a unanimous points win over American Rydell Booker and maintained his position as the IBF's number-one challenger for the winner of champion Andy Ruiz Jr's rematch with Anthony Joshua.</p>
