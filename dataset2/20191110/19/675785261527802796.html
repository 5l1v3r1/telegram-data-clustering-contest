      <h1>Man Utd finally have a springboard to kickstart their season after Brighton win</h1>
      <h2>The Red Devils have had a turbulent start to the season, but produced a performance to excite fans at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:46:49+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Finally, a performance to excite Manchester United fans after such a turbulent start to the season.</p>
      <p>The goals are flowing and while this win may only have lifted them up to seventh, the progress Ole Gunnar Solskajer claimed to have seen in training is now visible on the pitch.</p>
      <p>United, famed for their free-scoring ways, had managed a meagre six goals in as many home games before their 3-0 Europa League win over Partizan Belgrade in midweek.</p>
      <p>But they have now scored six in their last two home games, with the youngest side the Premier League has seen this season – average age 23 years and 350 days – and 21 shots on goal here suggesting the future may be bright after all under Solskjaer.</p>

      <p>The return of Anthony Martial, injured for two months, has been key to United's revival. The link-up play between him, Marcus Rashford and Daniel James was sublime here, while the France striker set up two of United's goals.</p>
      <p>James was electrifying on the right, while behind him Fred and Scott McTominay dominated the midfield, with 19-year-old left-back Brandon Williams – making his first league start – doing enough to make the position his own.</p>
      <p>Williams earned a standing ovation from United fans and a hug from skipper Harry Maguire when he came off in the 90th minute, his assured display another huge plus on afternoon of many for Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>The home side were in command from the start, putting the visitors under immediate pressure, with United's front three of James, Martial and Rashford causing Graham Potter's side all sorts of problems.</p>

      <p>Martial and Andreas Pereira combined to plunder the first goal, some quick interplay between the two ending with the former cutting the ball back for the latter, whose deflected shot went in off Dale Stephens.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later and it was 2-0, courtesy of own goal. Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk brought down James on the right with a cynical lunge after the United winger had beaten him to the ball.</p>
      <p>Fred slung in the free-kick, which fell in a congested six-yard box, Davey Propper eventually turning it into his own net, under pressure from Scott McTominay.</p>
      <p>The two-goal lead was entirely deserved, with United on the front foot from the start, determined to build on the win over Partizan, in which they could have easily won by double that margin, a similar story here.</p>

      <p>On the rare occasions Brighton threatened, they lacked conviction in front of the United goal. Shane Duffy sent the ball wide from a Leandro Trossard free-kick in the 28th minute, while Aaron Connolly was unable to direct a header on target.</p>
      <p>Brighton came close to pulling one back in the 63rd minute when Neal Maupay forced a close-range save from David De Gea. But the goal duly came a minute later, Brighton skipper Lewis Dunk rising to head the ball in and give the visitors hope.</p>
      <p>But that hope was extinguished two minutes later, Martial cutting the ball back for Rashford, who scored off the underside of the bar, to restore United's two-goal advantage.</p>

      <p>It was a case of from the sublime to the ridiculous for Rashford moments later, missing what amounted to an open goal, after another burst of pace down the right and exquisite delivery from James.</p>
      <p>It could have been six or seven, but United had to settle for three. After a season that started so poorly, they will take that, with such uplifting progress in terms of their play.</p>
      <p>With 11 games in 35 days after the international break, United finally have a springboard from which to kickstart their season.</p>
