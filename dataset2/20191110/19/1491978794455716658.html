        <i><b>Monday:</b> Greater Sydney to face maximum bushfire alert as more than 80 fires continue to burn. Plus: Newstart recipients take their case to parliament</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 November.</p>
      <h3>Top stories</h3>
      <p><b>Vast swathes of New South Wales and Queensland are on maximum bushfire alert,</b> with the greater Sydney region <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/10/nsw-and-queensland-fires-sydney-to-face-catastrophic-fire-danger-for-first-time">facing catastrophic fire danger for the first time</a> since ratings were introduced. More than 80 fires continue to burn in blazes that have claimed three lives and destroyed at least 150 properties. High temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions are expected to exacerbate operations on Tuesday. The prime minister has announced disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child, while visiting affected areas alongside the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. Mid-north coast resident Terri Nicholson said she was “gobsmacked” by the scale of the fires in northern NSW. “It’s quite intense to see ancient, iconic rainforest burn … and see firefighters here risking their lives and just to see global heating in action.”</p>
      <p><b>The unidentified intelligence official who sparked the presidential impeachment inquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/10/trump-impeachment-whistleblower-public-hearings-schiff-democrats-republicans">will not testify publicly</a>, </b>amid committee concerns that “President Trump and his allies” will “facilitate efforts … to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against” the individual. The inquiry concerns the president’s alleged bargaining of $400m in aid to Ukraine in return for investigations into his political rivals, which first came to light after the whistleblower raised concerns over a 25 July phone call between the two heads of state. Public hearings begin Wednesday, which is expected to bring the inquiry on to the national stage – and become a key battleground for public opinion ahead of the 2020 election.</p>
      <p><b>An Iranian man who spent six years detained on Manus Island has returned to Iran</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/designed-to-torture-asylum-seeker-chooses-iranian-prison-over-png-detention-centre">just nine weeks after being transferred to a new facility in Port Moresby</a>, where he says the conditions are so stifling they’re “designed to torture people”. Facing a potential prison sentence in Iran, the man, alongside five of the other 51 asylum seekers transferred to the Bomana facility, has abandoned his asylum request. Detailing a lack of access to legal support or family, a lack of books and writing materials, and meagre rations that leave those inside perpetually hungry, the man said a dozen asylum seekers have attempted self-harm, with most failing to receive medical attention, and some moved away to isolation cells.</p>

      <p><b>Allegations of terrorism against a 70-year-old Australian man held in detention in Vietnam are “absolutely false”, </b>according to his wife <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/11/terrorist-claim-against-australian-man-in-vietnam-absolutely-false-his-wife-says">who has petitioned the prime minister</a> to fight for retired baker Chau Van Kham’s release.</p>

      <p><b>Anger and frustration, stories of self-harm and suicide – the “most important inquiry” in 25 years sees federal senators hear firsthand from Newstart recipients. </b>Sixty-one-year-old Deborah, a factory worker for 30 years, speaks of her humiliation and desire for basic dignity through a living wage. With the Newstart allowance remaining the same, in real terms, since 1994 and with more than 3 million Australians living in poverty, the hearings have been well-received from the business community. But Scott Morrison remains unmoved, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/11/please-listen-to-us-the-newstart-recipients-trying-to-convince-scott-morrison-hes-wrong">writes Luke Henriques-Gomes</a>.</p>
      <p><b>They’re the activist group credited with helping Commonwealth Bank get out of coal in five years, </b>but why is the government starting to target what it calls the “radical activist group” Market Forces and what concrete legislation does prime minister Scott Morrison have in mind to curtail business-focused activism? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/11/inside-market-forces-the-small-climate-group-scott-morrison-wants-to-put-out-of-business">Adam Morton talks to the group’s executive director Julien Vincent</a> about an organisation that moved from an anti-capitalist space and now finds unlikely backers from within the orthodoxy.</p>
      <p><b>Darwin is often stereotyped as Australia at its most ocker – a place you come to crack a cold one and skim-read an NT News article about blokes wrestling crocs. </b>But the city is so much more than just a gateway to Kakadu, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/nov/11/laksa-larrikins-and-tropical-light-a-visitors-guide-to-darwin">writes Katie Cunningham</a>. It’s more a south-east Asian city than a desert outpost. “Palm trees dot the city and humidity hugs you year-round. Thai sweets, Cambodian pancakes and bowls of Vietnamese pho are sold alongside even more laksa.” And that’s before you get to the Indigenous art, museums and spectacular open-air installations such as Bruce Munro’s Tropical Light exhibition.</p>

      <p><b>Does Australia need a religious freedom bill?</b> That’s the question posed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/nov/11/does-australia-need-a-religious-freedom-bill">in this episode of Full Story</a>, as Laura Murphy-Oates is joined by David Marr and Paul Karp. There’s one such bill before parliament to be discussed in coming months – and critics say instead of protecting vulnerable people, it could act as a licence for hate.</p>
