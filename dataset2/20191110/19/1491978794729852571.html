      </p>
      <p>An endurance athlete from Dorset has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world after completing a 26.2 mile race in Athens.</p>
      <p>Nick Butter set off on his mission to run the famous distance in all 196 United Nations-recognised countries on 6 January 2018, finishing with the Athens classic marathon on Sunday. He has raised more than £65,000 for Prostate Cancer UK.</p>
      <p>The 22-month challenge was inspired by Kevin Webber, who Butter describes as having had “a huge impact on me and how I live my life”. Webber, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014, joined the ultra runner as he completed his 196th marathon.</p>
      <p>“The feeling of crossing that finish line was like many other finish lines, in the sense that I’m tired and I want a drink and want to be go bed,” Butter said in Athens. “The elation of finishing that run with Kevin and everyone else behind me was just so amazing. I wasn’t really sure what I was going to feel like when I finished.</p>
      <p>“I feel a bit numb, I’m not really sure what’s going to happen next and I am so, so ready to chat with Kev and have a proper conversation about everything that’s happened in the last few years because we haven’t had time to catch up.”</p>
