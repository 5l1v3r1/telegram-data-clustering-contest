      <p>Pete Doherty was arrested after a drunken fight in Paris on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The brawl broke out while the singer was celebrating his release from a police cell.</p>
      <p>Pete, 40, was in his PJs when he was handcuffed on the scene by police officers.</p>
      <p>It was claimed the musician packed on the punches at a teenage adversary in the upmarket Saint-Germain-des-Pres district in the city of Love.</p>
      <p>It all went down just one day after Doherty had been released from custody where he was being held for cocaine abuse in a separate incident.</p>

      <p>His lawyer Arash Derambarsh told the Parisien news outlet that Doherty went home and took sleeping pills but then went out again wearing his pijamas.</p>
      <p>Pete wanted to "go and celebrate his liberation in a bar near him," said Mr Derambarsh. "He drank and people made him drink."</p>
      <p>Doherty was said to have got into a fight with an unnamed teenager, 19, who filed a complaint to the police.</p>
      <p>Now the musician faces fresh charges for "violence by a person in a state of drunkenness".</p>

      <p>"Before being questioned by police, Doherty was put somewhere where he could sober up," said an investigating source.</p>
      <p>Before his latest arrest, Doherty had been released following two days in police custody for reportedly buying cocaine in the northern Pigalle district of Paris. </p>
      <p>Under a fast track procedure, he was provisionally fined the equivalent of £4300 for using a banned drug – a sentence which is yet to be approved by a judge. </p>
      <p>In Pigalle, Doherty was arrested during an alleged street drug deal witnessed by police.</p>

      <p>The Libertines singer was again said to be drunk and in possession of cocaine when approached by officers at around 3am.</p>
      <p>"The suspect was arrested in the Pigalle district, and was carrying two grammes of cocaine," said an investigating source.</p>
      <p>"The allegation is that he was involved in an illegal street transaction at the time. He was drunk and did not comply with the police to begin with, but was eventually taken to a police car."</p>
      <p>Doherty was taken into custody in central Paris and then placed under formal criminal investigation, Paris prosecutors confirmed.  </p>
      <p>There were witnesses to the arrest in Pigalle – an area full of bars and clubs – and many passers-by shot videos of what happened. </p>
      <p>Doherty, the ex-boyfriend of supermodel Kate Moss, has convictions for drug offences, and also for theft and driving without a licence.</p>
      <p>In the past, he has pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine. </p>
      <p>Since moving to Margate, Kent, in 2017 Doherty has been arrested by the police on a number of occasions. </p>
      <p>In January this year he was held for 48 hours and questioned. Charges of drug possession and driving related offenses were later dropped.</p>
