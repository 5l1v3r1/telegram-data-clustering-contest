      <p>CAPE TOWN: South Africa loose-forward Francois Louw confirmed his retirement from international rugby on Sunday, the second of the Springboks' World Cup-winning side to call time on their careers in the green and gold.</p>
      <p>Louw, who came off the replacement bench for captain Siya Kolisi in the 32-12 victory over England in the World Cup decider on Nov. 2, won 76 test caps having made his debut in 2010.</p>

      <p>"I couldn't have asked for a more fulfilling career with the Springboks and I bow out with a full heart," he said in a media release from South Africa Rugby.</p>
      <p>"I've had an amazing journey in international rugby. I've made friends for life in the game and created incredible memories with great people."</p>
      <p>Bok coach Rassie Erasmus was full of praise for the contribution of the Bath loose-forward to their World Cup campaign.</p>
      <p>"Flo was a real warrior of the back row. He was always ready to go where the fire was hottest and was the kind of tough-minded character that you'd always want beside you," Erasmus said.</p>
      <p>"He has been a tremendous servant of South African rugby and we're losing a lot with his retirement, not just in how he played, but in the calmness, insight and character that he brought to the group."</p>
      <p>Louw's retirement follows that of prop Tendai Mtawarira, who won the last of his 117 caps in the World Cup final.</p>
