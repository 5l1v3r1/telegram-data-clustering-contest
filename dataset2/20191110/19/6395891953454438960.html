      <p><b>MEXICO CITYÂ (AP)</b> - Forensic scientists in the Mexican state of Sonora have recovered 10 bodies from mass graves near a beach town, raising the total number of bodies and skeletons found in the area since October to 52.</p>
      <p>The state attorney's office said Saturday they were tipped off to the desert burial pits by a group of volunteers called Searching Mothers that tries to find missing people.</p>
      <p>The bodies were found near the Gulf of California beach town of Puerto Penasco, known to U.S. tourists as Rocky Point.</p>
      <p>Authorities began pulling human remains from the burial pits at the end of October. Mexican forensic personnel are conducting autopsies.</p>
      <p>Drug and kidnapping gangs often bury the bodies of people they have killed in such clandestine sites.</p>
