        <b>Liverpool have gone nine points clear of Manchester City after hammering their rivals 3-1 at Anfield.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s team put City to the sword on Sunday afternoon, convincingly beating Pep Guardiola’s side thanks to goals from Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Bernardo Silva scored a consolation goal for City.</p>
      <p>Although there are still two-thirds of the season to play, Liverpool’s victory undoubtedly puts them in pole position in the title race. They are now eight points ahead of Leicester City and Chelsea in second and third place respectively and nine clear of champions City.</p>

      <p>The game arguably hinged on a 30-second passage of play in the opening period of the first half. The ball struck Trent Alexander-Arnold’s arm in the Liverpool penalty area and Man City’s players appealed for a spot-kick, but the referee Michael Oliver waved play on. Klopp’s team mounted a counter-attack while their opponents protested. Sadio Mane’s cross bounced loose in the City box, Ilkay Gundogan’s tame clearance landed with Fabinho in space outside the penalty area. The Brazilian steadied himself and struck a wonderful shot beyond the diving Claudio Bravo to put Liverpool ahead after six minutes.</p>
      <p>Seven minutes later, the home side doubled their lead. Salah headed home at the back post following a brilliant delivery from Andy Robertson, which was preceded by a stunning switch of play from Alexander-Arnold. City had some chances in the first half to reduce the deficit, but their patched up back-four were floundering against the relentless Liverpool front-three.</p>
      <p>Bravo looked bereft of confidence in goal and would make an avoidable error for the third goal. Liverpool were evidently targeting Angelino at left-back, and neither John Stones nor Kyle Walker covered themselves in glory. Fernandinho, a veteran midfielder playing out of position, looked exactly that – a veteran midfielder playing out of position.</p>

      <p>In midfield, Fabinho was magnificent for Liverpool, reading the game well and providing a solid base for Liverpool to spring attacks, he rarely lost the ball.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold was targeted as the home side’s weak-link in a Champions League tie between the teams in the spring of 2018. On Sunday, he was one of the most influential players on the pitch. Alexander-Arnold had the most touches (89), crosses (6) and key passes (2) of any Liverpool player. Upfront, Mane got a deserved goal, turning in Jordan Henderson’s excellent cross, with some help from Bravo in the City goal.</p>
      <p>Bernardo made the scoreline more respectable with his strike in the second half but, despite some borderline decisions, Liverpool were worthy winners.</p>
      <p>City’s patched-up backline, rather than the use of the VAR, proved the difference in the game as they were incapable of repelling Liverpool.</p>
