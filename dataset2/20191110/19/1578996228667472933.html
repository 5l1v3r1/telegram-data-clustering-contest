      <h1>Jennifer Aniston Posts Hilarious Throwback Photo On Instagram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:25:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Erika Harwood</a></address>
      <p>Jennifer Aniston hasn’t been on Instagram that long, but she clearly knows exactly what she’s doing. The actress posted a throwback photo of her and her longtime hair stylist Chris<b> </b>McMillan on Saturday, showing the two while they worked together on <i>Friends</i>, presumably filming one of the flashback scenes of Rachel back in the 80s. McMillan, it should be noted, is the one responsible for Aniston’s iconic “Rachel” haircut.</p>

      <p>“Happy Birthday, Chrissy,” Aniston wrote. “We've come a long way, baby.”</p>

      <p>Aniston joined Instagram last month, causing the app to crash. She posted a video addressing the technical issue, showing her slamming her phone on a table.</p>
      <p>“I swear I didn’t mean to break it,” she wrote. “Thank you guys for the kind, glitchy welcome.”</p>
      <p>Aniston now holds <a href="https://time.com/5704799/jennifer-aniston-instagram/">the record</a> for the fastest account to hit the 1 million follower mark, though she’s currently at a cool 19.1 million followers. She beat out Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who previously held the title with their @sussexroyal account.</p>
      <p>Of course, she’s been keeping fans happy with plenty of <i>Friends</i>-related content. Her first post was a selfie of her with her former co-stars Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, and Matthew Perry, the latter being the only one of the group not on Instagram.</p>

      <p>“And now we’re Instagram FRIENDS too,” she captioned the photo, which has racked up over 15 million likes. “HI INSTAGRAM.”</p>
