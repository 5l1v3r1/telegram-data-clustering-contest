      <p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Sunday praised Bolivian President Evo Morales’ decision to call for new elections, calling it a “triumph of democracy.”</p>
      <p>“There are always attitudes, there is an authoritarian eagerness to want to resolve things with confrontation, with violence,” Lopez Obrador said in a video posted to his Twitter page. “The best method to resolve differences is the democratic one.”</p>
      <p>Morales said on Sunday he would call for new elections after the Organization of American States (OAS) released a report saying that a disputed Oct. 20 vote should be annulled due to irregularities.</p>
