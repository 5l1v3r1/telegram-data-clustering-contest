        <i>More than 140 flood warnings and alerts in place as South Yorkshire villagers evacuate</i>
      </p>
      <p>Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for the UK this week and more flooding is expected as communities already affected struggle to cope.</p>
      <p>Seven severe “danger to life” flood warnings remain in place in South <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> in areas along the River Don. The Met Office also issued 41 active flood warnings and 94 flood alerts, and said a weather system moving across Europe would bring a “fair amount” of rainfall to England and Wales.</p>
      <p>Widespread flooding affected towns across the Midlands and northern England on Thursday and Friday. The body of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/09/severe-flood-warnings-remain-in-midlands-and-north-of-england">was found in the River Derwent on Friday morning</a> after she was swept away by flood water in Darley Dale near Matlock.</p>
      <p>Parts of the village of Fishlake near Doncaster in South Yorkshire were still cut off on Sunday, and under a metre (3ft) of water from the nearby River Don. Only tractors were able to get in by road. The local council called on residents to evacuate their homes.</p>
      <p>A rest centre was set up on at nearby Stainforth community centre for evacuees. Among visibly shaken arrivals from Fishlake were Chris Davies and Lorraine Healy. The flood waters rose so quickly on Friday evening that they were only able to grab two small plastic bags of clothing, and their three animals, a rabbit and two parrots, they said.</p>

      <p>“My whole car was under water. It took 30 minutes for everything to get flooded,” said Davies, 33. His rabbit Amber and parrot Jojo were safe but his other parrot, Ruby, had died of stress, he said.. He thought his house must be under four or five feet of water. He and Healy had borrowed money to stay at a local hotel in Lakeside, he said.</p>
      <p>Dan Greenslade, also from Fishlake, had been trying to get back to his flooded house after his girlfriend gave birth to their daughter on Friday. “I know it’s under water. A neighbour sent some pictures of the outside of it. But that was yesterday, and they say the waters are rising,” he said. “We’ve just decorated it and we moved in three weeks ago to get ready for the baby.” They were staying with his girlfriend’s parents in a nearby village, and friends had donated a Moses basket and baby clothes. “So the baby’s OK. But all of her stuff is at our house.”</p>
      <p>Nigel and Stephanie Roberts, who moved to Fishlake two months ago had been staying with their son in neighbouring Hatfield since the early hours of Saturday. They were hoping to hitch a ride to their home with a food convoy to rescue their parrot, Del Boy, who was stranded on the top floor.</p>

      <p>Stephanie said: “The garage started to flood about an inch and within two hours we had a foot of water. Then it entered the house and the kitchen. It was bubbling up through the floorboards.”</p>
      <p>About half of Fishlake’s 700 residents had already left, some spending Saturday in the Hare and Hounds pub, and others seeking shelter and company in the church. Others were staying in the upper floors of their homes.</p>
      <p>Some remaining residents have criticised Doncaster council for leaving them stranded. The council said it was unable to provide “on-the-ground support” because the area was covered by a severe flood warning and the advice was for residents to evacuate.</p>
      <p>Roselyn Jones, Doncaster’s mayor, said the Environment Agency had warned the water level could rise further. “The recommendation is to evacuate. Our first priority is preserving life,” she said.</p>

      <p>The Hare and Hounds were supplying food to those stranded in their homes, but the landlords, Angie and Scott Godfrey, tsaid on social media on Sunday that they were “fuming” that Doncaster council had not kept them supplied. “We have been inundated with calls, messages from people wanting a HOT MEAL. These people have no electricity &amp; are living upstairs. We have the equipment to cook the lunches, we just need the food!!” they wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>South Yorkshire police said it had extra officers working in Doncaster to patrol and protect the evacuated areas. The Environment Agency said water levels on the Don had peaked in most places and were receding, but warned of more wet weather that “rivers may respond quickly to” on Monday and asked people to sign up to flood warnings.</p>
      <p>Sophie Yeomans at the Met Office said it was going to be an “unsettled week in terms of rain”. The forecast was for rain to reach Northern Ireland on Sunday evening, before affecting Wales and north-west England later and then spreading across the rest of the UK into Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Northern Rail said disruption in South Yorkshire could continue until Tuesday morning in some areas and that a significant amount of work was required before the tracks were cleared. Flood waters continued to subside, but tracks in several locations remained under water and debris and damage were surfacing as they receded, it said.</p>
