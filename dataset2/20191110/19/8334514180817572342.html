      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - The Socialists of acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were seen ahead in Spain’s repeat election on Sunday while the far-right Vox jumped to third place, according to an opinion poll by GAD3 published as mainland voting ended.</p>
      <p>The conservative People’s Party came second, according to the poll, while neither the left nor the right were seen having a majority.</p>
      <p>The survey for public broadcaster RTVE was based on voting intentions and collated over several days ahead of the election.</p>
      <p>In recent elections, early opinion polls carried out using a different methodology did not always give an accurate picture of the eventual results.</p>
