      <p>Sundowns lost further ground on Absa Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs following a 3-2 loss to Steve Komphela's men on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Onyango made a costly error when spilling Phiri's strike into his own net to gift Arrows the equaliser in the second half.</p>
      <p>"As I said difficult game, what can you say difficult conditions for both teams obviously. Ja, the biggest mistake by our number one goalkeeper [Denis Onyango], it happens, it's the conditions," Mosimane told SuperSport after the game.</p>
      <p>"He applied the wrong technique and the ball bounced differently but it's okay, we accept [defeat]."</p>
      <p>Mosimane also expanded on his late changes that saw Sibusiso Vilakazi and Jose Ali Meza introduced.</p>
      <p>"We tried to get the speed behind, that change helped us, that's why 'Vila' [Vilakazi] managed to go through on the right once or twice. I though [Divine] Lunga could've been booked on that foul because the referee spoke to him three times.</p>
      <p>"I though the third time he was going to book him but he didn't, it's okay. We got the goal, we could've scored another one in the last minute to be honest, but it's OK, it's difficult conditions, a difficult game for us. Ja, I never thought we'll lose this game."</p>
