      <p>Neil Lennon has delivered a firm response as Celtic assistant coach <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> has been linked with the Hibs job.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead no.2 is reportedly on a five-man short list for the vacant post at Easter Road.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> is the front runner for the position and will hold talks with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> chiefs on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But Lennon insists his right-hand man isn't going anywhere if he is approached by the Leith side.</p>

      <p>He said: "I don't want him to go for a start.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't surprise me, because he is a superb coach.</p>
      <p>"It is a feather in a cap for John if that is the case but as far as I'm concerned he won't be going anywhere, he is very integral to what we are doing here."</p>

      <p>Celtic maintained their lead at the top of the Premiership with a 2-0 win over Motherwell as Odsonne Edouard opened the scoring, before Richard Tait netted an own goal to hand the champions all three points.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> also picked up a comfortable victory against Livingston as they trail their rivals on goal difference as they head into the international break.</p>
