      <p>Eight people were killed when a bomb exploded on Sunday in an area of northeast <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a> controlled by Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a>'s defence ministry said the bombing, which it blamed on Kurdish fighters, took place southeast of the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, which Turkey captured in a military offensive last month.</p>
      <p>"Eight civilians lost their lives and more than 20 were wounded in an attack by a booby-trapped vehicle," it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The village of Suluk, where Sunday's explosion took place, is about 10km (4.5 miles) south of the border. A small truck exploded outside a bakery there, an emergency worker told Reuters News Agency. </p>

      <p>Turkey halted its military advance inside Syria when it <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/turkey-russia-agree-set-syria-safe-zone-joint-patrols-191022171933484.html">struck deals</a> with the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> and Russia for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), considered a "terrorist group" by Ankara, to be moved at least 30km (20 miles) away from the border with Turkey.</p>
      <p>The offensive faced international criticism over fears it could undermine efforts to prevent the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) group from re-emerging in Syria and unleash another humanitarian crisis in the eight-year conflict.</p>
      <h3>Abandoned US ally</h3>
      <p>YPG was the lead force in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Washington's main ally in the battle against ISIL in Syria. US President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html">Donald Trump</a> has faced domestic criticism for announcing a troop withdrawal that was seen as a green light for Turkey's cross-border campaign against the armed group.</p>
      <p>Turkish President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> has said both Moscow and Washington failed to meet their commitments under last month's agreements for the YPG to withdraw from the border, and warned the offensive could resume.</p>
      <p>He spoke to Russian President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/vladimir-putin.html">Vladimir Putin</a> by phone on Saturday, and meets Trump in Washington on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>YPG is viewed by Turkey as an offshoot of the armed Kurdistan Workers' Party (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/pkk.html">PKK</a>), considered a "terrorist" organisation whose struggle for autonomy has killed tens of thousands of Turks over the past 35 years.</p>
      <p>The recent Turkish operation was aimed at seizing a strip of land roughly 30km (18.6 miles) deep along the 440-km (440-mile) border between the two countries.  </p>
      <p>Ankara says it wants to establish a "safe zone" there to resettle up to two million of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts on its soil because of the war.</p>
