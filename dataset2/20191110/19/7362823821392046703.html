      <h1>Patriots' Robert Kraft told Rob Gronkowski he wants him back for playoffs, report says</h1>

      <p>When three-time Super Bowl champion <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/rob-gronkowski">Rob Gronkowski</a> announced his stunning retirement back in March, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</a> owner Robert Kraft walked up to him in the locker room to say goodbye -- while telling the superstar tight end he wanted Gronk to return for November, according to an NFL Network <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001074684/article/pats-robert-kraft-wants-rob-gronkowski-back-for-playoffs">report</a>.</p>
      <p>That November date would be key.</p>
      <p>The last day that Gronkowski could request a potential reinstatement to the Patriots roster would be Saturday, Nov. 30, a day before their Week 13 game against the Houston Texans.</p>

      <p>“Owner Robert Kraft walked up to him to say goodbye. According to sources, Kraft delivered a clear and concise message that would resonate for months,” NFL Network's Ian Rapoport <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001074684/article/pats-robert-kraft-wants-rob-gronkowski-back-for-playoffs">reported</a>. “Kraft told Gronkowski that he wants him to return for November, December, and a playoff run. If that happened, the team not only would welcome him back but will remain hopeful that it happens.”</p>
      <p>If Gronk were to return, it’s almost certain the team would honor his request. Kraft appeared on NFL Network last month saying: “There is still hope for us with Gronk.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the tight end left open the possibility of a return.</p>
      <p>“I’m just in the first stage right now,” Gronkowski said back in September when announcing his partnership with CBDmedic, a cannabidiol company. “When that time comes down in the future, if I have the desire to play football again, if I feel passionate about football again, if I’m feeling I need to be out there on the field, I will go back to football.”</p>

      <p>“As of right now, that is not the case. It could be the case in six months; it could be the case in two years; it could be the case in three years; it could be the case in three months. But, I truly don’t see it in the foreseeable future, in like a week or a month,” he added.</p>
      <p>In his post-NFL life, Gronkowski has been getting into the business world, while also joining Fox Sports as a television analyst last month.</p>
      <p>In addition, he’s talked about the injuries he received while playing football -- focusing mainly on concussions.</p>
      <p>“I used to have liquid, [my head] used to be thick. My head used to be thicker, like a centimeter of liquid in some spots and I’d feel it and be like, ‘What the heck?’ You could put indents in my head,” he said back in August.</p>

      <p>Even so, Gronkowski didn't rule out a possible return during an appearance on ABC News’ “Good Morning America” Aug. 28.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been changing up everything, having new energy. I may be back!” he said.</p>
