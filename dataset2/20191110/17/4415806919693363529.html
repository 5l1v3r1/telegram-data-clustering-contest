      <p>Wolves 2 - 1 Aston Villa</p>
      <p>Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez earned derby bragging rights for Wolves with a dominant 2-1 win over Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Neves’ first-half thunderbolt and Jimenez’s late effort lifted Nuno Espirito Santo’s side to eighth in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Trezeguet grabbed an injury-time consolation for Villa.</p>

      <p>It was Wolves’ first top-flight win since their stunning success at Manchester City a month ago.</p>
      <p>Yet they are now unbeaten in seven and just one point behind the top five after inflicting a third straight Premier League defeat on Villa.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith’s Villa – now three points above the relegation zone – desperately missed injured skipper Jack Grealish as they fell to a limp defeat at Molineux.</p>

      <p>They were second best from the start and Wolves threatened early on with a Matt Doherty effort which was deflected wide.</p>
      <p>Two minutes later the wing-back’s cross came back off the bar with Villa goalkeeper Jed Steer injuring himself trying to tip it over.</p>
      <p>Steer was making his first league appearance of the season, with Tom Heaton out with a training ground knock, but the 27-year-old lasted just eight minutes as he limped off for Orjan Nyland, the Norway international’s first game since December 18.</p>
      <p>That was a further blow for Villa to add to the absence of playmaker Grealish, and they struggled to settle as Wolves dominated and Jimenez volleyed wide after Jonny’s deflected shot.</p>

      <p>Villa beat a weakened Wolves 2-1 in the Carabao Cup less than two weeks ago but, back up to full strength, the hosts had too much.</p>
      <p>They continued to cut through Villa’s midfield but were wasteful, Jota heading at Nyland and Jimenez slicing wide.</p>
      <p>Wolves continued to find space easily and wanted a penalty after 34 minutes when the overworked Matt Targett tangled with Doherty but their appeals were ignored.</p>
      <p>However, the hosts finally found a deserved breakthrough four minutes before the break.</p>

      <p>Tyrone Mings brought down Adama Traore on the right and Joao Moutinho squared his free-kick to Neves to crash in a low drive from 20 yards.<br/><br/>It was the midfielder’s first goal since August and came after boss Nuno demanded more from the Portugal international in midweek.</p>
      <p>Things got worse for Villa when Targett was forced off in first-half injury time, being replaced by Neil Taylor.</p>
      <p>Villa were there for the taking and Traore, who spent a year at Villa Park after joining from Barcelona in 2015, rattled the bar from 16 yards five minutes into the second half.</p>

      <p>Jimenez shot wide and Neves’ drive deflected over soon after as Wolves continued to run the game.</p>
      <p>Villa looked ready to roll over but Wesley fired over a rare chance from 18 yards in a warning for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Wolves, though, were rarely in danger and they pushed for a second, Jota’s drive was turned over by Nyland after 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards Jimenez dragged wide and both teams had cries for penalties rejected when, first, Trezeguet went down in the box and then Traore’s cross struck Taylor on the chest.</p>

      <p>Villa tried to exert some late pressure but their hopes were ended with six minutes left when Traore broke down the right and squared for Jimenez to roll in.</p>
      <p>Trezeguet’s close-range drive, given by goal line technology, in injury-time then gave the scoreline a flattering look for Villa.</p>
