        <b>The parents of Harry Dunn have been told by the UK government their claims of abuse of power by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are "without foundation".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old died in hospital after a crash in Northamptonshire in August. US suspect Anne Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity.</p>
      <p>The teenager's parents allege the granting of immunity by Mr Raab was "wrong in law".</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office (FCO) has written to the family rejecting the allegations.</p>
      <p>It told the BBC it had sent a letter - seen by the BBC - to Mr Dunn's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, but would not comment on its content. It expressed its "deepest sympathy" to the family.</p>

      <p>In the letter, the FCO said it would "seek costs" for any judicial review brought and argues the family has not found "any reasonably arguable ground of legal challenge".</p>
      <p>It said the allegation that the foreign secretary had "misused and/or abused his power" was "entirely without foundation".</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn's motorbike crashed with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas, the 42-year-old wife of US intelligence officer Jonathan Sacoolas, outside RAF Croughton, near Brackley, on 27 August.</p>
      <p>Northamptonshire Police has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-50263769">handed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service</a> after interviewing Mrs Sacoolas in the US.</p>

      <p>Family spokesman Radd Seiger said: "The FCO relies on two private agreements between the USA and UK dated in 1995 and 2001 to assert that Anne Sacoolas did have diplomatic immunity."</p>
      <p>He added the family had taken legal advice and its "position is clear that these arrangements have no basis in law".</p>
      <p>He continued: "As if it were not enough for the family to have to endure the loss of Harry, the British government now appear[s] intent on putting them through a needless and protracted legal battle culminating in court. So be it. They will not rest until justice is done. But shame on the government."</p>
