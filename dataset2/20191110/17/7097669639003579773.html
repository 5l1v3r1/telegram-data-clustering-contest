      <h1>Michael Bloomberg garners highest Democratic unfavorable rating in new poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:58:37+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Tim O'Donnell</a></address>
      <p>A new poll released by <i>Morning Consult</i> on Sunday brought some good news and bad news for potential Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/10/michael-bloomberg-2020-poll-068484"><i>Politico</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who filed for the Alabama primary Friday, but has not yet made a final decision about officially launching a campaign, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/10/michael-bloomberg-2020-poll-068484">finished</a> in sixth place in the poll at 4 percent, which is not terrible considering he's a newcomer. He was also shown beating President Trump by six percentage points in a hypothetical general election matchup. But 25 percent of those surveyed also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/10/michael-bloomberg-2020-poll-068484">said</a> they view the former New York City mayor and billionaire unfavorably. That was the highest unfavorable rating in the poll.</p>
      <p>His potential Democratic opponents don't seem too high on him entering the race either. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877599/bernie-sanders-michael-bloomberg-aint-going-buy-election">called him out</a> directly during a campaign speech in Iowa on Saturday, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was skeptical of his candidacy during an appearance Sunday on CNN's <i>State of the Union</i>.</p>
