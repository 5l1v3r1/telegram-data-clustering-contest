      <p>Manchester United 3 - 1 Brighton</p>
      <p>Manchester United injected some much-needed positivity into their Premier League campaign by comprehensively beating Brighton on an afternoon when Marcus Rashford went from the sublime to ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Having faced uncomfortable questions during the previous international break following a shock loss at Newcastle, the mood around Old Trafford this time is one of optimism.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are up to seventh after comfortably defeating Brighton 3-1, with an effort from Andreas Pereira and Davy Propper’s own goal putting United on course for a victory that Rashford wrapped up after Lewis Dunk had reduced the deficit.</p>

      <p>The England forward’s thumping strike off the underside of the bar capped a fine overall display, although the 22-year-old will not want to see back his inexplicable close-range miss.</p>
      <p>Rashford’s confidence did not appear to be knocked by that, though, as the Brighton goal came under siege towards the end of just United’s fourth Premier League victory of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Albion never looked like securing their first ever win at Old Trafford, where Scott McTominay’s serious-looking injury late on was a concern.</p>

      <p>It was a better afternoon for fellow academy graduate Brandon Williams, who left to a standing ovation after impressing on his first Premier League start.</p>
      <p>United showed few signs of fatigue after beating Partizan Belgrade on Thursday and unnerved the normally reliable Albion backline from the outset.</p>
      <p>Rashford was unable to follow a superb, weaving run with a fitting finish with the hosts’ first clear-cut chance, but Solskjaer’s side would make the breakthrough in the 17th minute.</p>

      <p>Victor Lindelof and Fred were involved in a move that ended with Andreas Pereira racing through the middle.</p>
      <p>Dale Stephens’ tackle looked to have ended that attack, only for the ball to fall kindly for Martial, with the Frenchman cutting back for the Brazilian to hit a strike that went in off the unlucky Albion midfielder.</p>
      <p>Matters would soon get worse for Graham Potter’s men after Dunk was booked for a late, clumsy challenge on Daniel James. Fred produced a fine delivery from the resulting free-kick, leading to a bundling McTominay effort being prodded over the line by Propper.</p>

      <p>The VAR checked Harry Maguire’s involvement and, 140 seconds after the ball crossed the line, Old Trafford was able to celebrate fully.</p>
      <p>It was a rare set-piece goal by United against an Albion side looking far more threatening from dead balls.</p>
      <p>Martial saw a handball appeal rejected and Pereira was denied from distance as United returned from the break strongly, but there were a few nervy moments when the stadium announcer confirmed that the VAR was checking for a red card.</p>

      <p>Teenager Williams and his team-mates was relieved to see his high foot on Steven Azalte remain a booking.</p>
      <p>Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan was equally relieved when he failed to deal with a Fred shot and it bounced back off the bar – a let-off Brighton capitalised on as Pascal Gross swung over a corner that Dunk was all too easily able to meet with a thumping header home.</p>
      <p>But rather than wilt, United rallied and within two minutes restored their two-goal cushion.</p>
      <p>Fred’s pass put Martial behind the Brighton backline and the Frenchman kept his composure when forced wide, playing back for Rashford to smash home off the underside of the bar.</p>

      <p>Only the England forward will know how he failed to score a quickfire second. James superbly raced down the right and sent a low cross over to Rashford, who inexplicably screwed wide at the far post with the goal at his mercy.</p>
      <p>It was a remarkable miss but United were undeterred as Williams and James quickly had attempts, before Rashford followed some wonderful footwork with a shot saved at the near post by Ryan.</p>
      <p>Martial and Rashford both went close as the match came to a disappointing end as McTominay went down with an injury that saw him leave on a stretcher.</p>
