      <p><b>LONDONÂ (AP)</b> - On the verge of an almost flawless performance against Matteo Berrettini at the ATP Finals, Novak Djokovic still found a reason to berate himself.</p>
      <p>Leading 4-0 in the second set on Sunday, Djokovic hit a backhand wide to concede a break to the Italian - the only blip in an otherwise dominant 6-2, 6-1 victory - and then angrily turned toward his player's box and shouted out his frustration.</p>
      <p>Even at the end of another grueling season, Djokovic won't tolerate any dips in his game as he pursues a record-equaling sixth ATP Finals title.</p>
      <p>"There's no other reasonable explanation (to that reaction) than trying to play as perfect as possible," Djokovic said. "But I guess that's me, you know."</p>
      <p>It was certainly the same Djokovic that the O2 Arena crowd has become used to seeing. Although the second-ranked Serb - who won four straight titles at the year-end event in London between 2012-15 - only needed to hit a total of 10 winners in the match as Berrettini's 28 unforced errors handed him an easy victory to start round-robin play.</p>
      <p>Berrettini's forehand was responsible for 18 of those errors, including two shots into the net to hand Djokovic the only two breaks of the first set.</p>
      <p>After giving up that lone break to make it 4-1 in the second, Djokovic broke right back and then clinched the victory with an easy forehand putaway at the net.</p>
      <p>"He missed a relatively easy forehand for him that gave me a break (in the first set)," Djokovic said. "And after that I started reading his serve better."</p>
      <p>Berrettini was making his debut at the event for world's top eight players and had never faced Djokovic before. He also said he struggled a bit with the speed of the indoor hard court at the O2.</p>
      <p>"The ball is not jumping a lot, so it's tough to mix, especially my forehand," Berrettini said. "I think it's better when I have a little bit more time and the ball takes more spin. . I think I started the match pretty good, but he was just better than me today."</p>
      <p>Roger Federer, who holds the record of six ATP Finals titles, was set to play Dominic Thiem later in the evening match.</p>
      <p>The other four-man group features Rafael Nadal, defending champion Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitispas and Daniil Medvedev. They begin play on Monday.</p>
      <p>Djokovic has a chance to overtake Nadal for the year-end No. 1 ranking with a strong showing in London. He trails the Spaniard by 640 ranking points, with a maximum of 1,500 points up for grabs.</p>
