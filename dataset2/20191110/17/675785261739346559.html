      <h2>Khabib Nurmagomedov, 31, recently told Conor McGregor he must win 10 fights in a row to earn a rematch - but that may now not happen</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:04:46+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov plans to hang up his gloves after a 'couple' more fights.</p>
      <p>Russian fighter Khabib, 31, holds the lightweight title with a perfect unbeaten record from his 27 fights to date.</p>
      <p>He recently confirmed a long-awaited fight with Tony Ferguson was in the works, while fans continue to hope for a rematch against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> .</p>
      <p>But during a press conference in Moscow, Khabib admitted: "My retirement is coming. A couple of fights more.”</p>
      <p>He added: "It would be wrong to talk about what I’m going to do after that because I’m currently working on different projects.</p>
      <p>"I’ll work on them later. I won’t get lost for sure.”</p>

      <p>Khabib went on to admit he is hopeful countryman Islam Makhachev will succeed him at the summit of the lightweight field.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to leave my belt for any Tom, Dick or Harry. I want the succession of generations to happen," he added.</p>
      <p>"I want to leave the belt and Islam Makhachev to take it.</p>
      <p>“It would be great if my retirement coincided with Islam’s title shot.”</p>

      <p>Khabib's finest hour came with his win over Conor McGregor in October 2018 and recently told the Irishman he must win 10 straight matches to face him again.</p>
      <p>“As for a rematch, to fight for a belt in the UFC, I remember I had something like nine or 10 fights. If he wins 10 fights in a row, then that’s completely possible,” Nurmagomedov said.</p>
      <p>His comments on his retirement would suggest a rematch with the Irishman is now unlikely.</p>
