      <p>NEW DELHI: India pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> on Sunday recorded the best-ever figures in the Twenty20 Internationals when he returned figures of six for seven runs against Bangladesh at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur.</p>
      <p>Chahar's 6 for 7 in 3.2 overs has bettered the previous record of 6 for 8 by Sri Lankan mystery spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajantha-Mendis">Ajantha Mendis</a> against Zimbabwe in 2012.</p>
      <p>Chahar's sensational bowling helped India win the third T20I by 30 runs as the hosts clinched the three-match series 2-1.</p>

      <p>Chahar also became the first Indian bowler to take a hat-trick in the shortest format of the game as he wrapped up the Bangladesh innings with the wickets of Shafiul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman and Aminul Islam in three consecutive deliveries. After dismissing Islam with the final delivery of the 18th over, Chahar came back to scalp Rahman and Islam on the first two balls of the final over to complete the hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Chahar started his spell with two wickets in two balls in his first over, the third of the innings, dismissing Liton Das and Soumya Sarkar. He then came back to break the dangerous partnership of 98 runs for the third wicket between Mohammad Naim (81) and Mohammad Mithun (27) by dismissing the latter in the 13th over.</p>
