      <h3>The upcoming YZF-R3 features a new front fairing, USD front forks and will likely be powered by a BS-VI compliant 321cc, parallel-twin motor</h3>
      <p>Yamaha India has sent an invite to the media for an upcoming launch event in Chennai on December 19th. The Japanese two-wheeler manufacturer has been tight-lipped about their upcoming product launch but according to a few reports, online the bike could be the updated YZF-R3. The R3 which is on sale in India received an update in the form of a new dual-channel ABS and Metzeler tyres during the 2018 Auto Expo.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Yamaha R3 which will likely be launched in December 19th received minor cosmetic and mechanical update in 2018. The updated YZF-R3 features a new front fairing that integrates a split twin LED headlamp at the front instead of the dual halogen headlamp setup.</p>
      <p>The front fairing also gets a larger windscreen and is more aerodynamic than its predecessor. The aerodynamic front fairing has helped make the motorcycle more efficient and its top speed has also gone up almost 8 kmph. Besides the new front fairing, the motorcycle also features an all-digital instrument cluster that replaced the semi-digital instrument cluster found on its predecessor.</p>

      <p>Besides the new cosmetic updates, the R3 also features an updated ergonomic as well. The clip-in handlebar of the fully-faired motorcycle has been lowered by almost 22mm to provide an aggressive riding position. The suspension duties of the Yamaha YZF-R3 are now taken care of by a KYB 37mm USD fork at the front.</p>
      <p>The upside-down forks replaced the conventional telescopic unit of its predecessor while the same preload-adjustable monoshock setup does duty at the rear. The braking duties of the R3 are taken care of by disc brakes on both ends. A dual-channel ABS is also offered as a standard for the safety of the rider.</p>
      <p>Expect the upcoming YZF-R3 to be powered by an updated BS-VI compliant 321cc, parallel-twin, liquid-cooled unit. The unit paired with a six-speed gearbox produces about 42PS of peak power and 29.6Nm of torque. As far as the pricing is concerned, expect the upcoming R3 to be priced atleast Rs 15-20 thousand more than the current model.</p>
