      <p><b>DARTMOUTH, Mass.</b> - A 19-year-old was hit by a pickup truck while riding his bike Saturday night in Dartmouth. He was brought to St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford for his injuries.</p>
      <p>Just before 11 p.m., Dartmouth Police and other emergency personnel went to the area of State Road at Cross Road and found the male with non-life threatening injuries. Dartmouth Fire officials assisted in treating him at the scene.</p>
      <p>He told police that he was stopped at a red light when he was hit from behind by a male in a pickup truck and fell off his bike.</p>
      <p>He said that the driver of the truck got out and asked if he was OK. When he said he wasn't, the driver told him he'd call police. After that, the driver allegedly got back in his truck and drove off.</p>
      <p>Police then searched the area for the truck and found Russell Nichols, 39, while conducting a traffic stop. While investigating, police learned that Nichols, from West Bridgewater, was responsible for the accident and also showed signs of impairment.</p>
      <p>After performing field sobriety tests, Nichols was arrested and charged with four counts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Operating under the influence of liquor (his second offense)</li>
        <li>Leaving the scene of a crash resulting in personal injury</li>
        <li>Operating after revocation of registration</li>
        <li>Operating an uninsured motor vehicle</li>
