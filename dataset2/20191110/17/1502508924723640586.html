      <p>There is speculation that the trust to construct and run the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ram-temple">Ram temple </a>in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>will be constituted on the basis of the laws that govern the trust for Jammu’s Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board or Gujarat’s Somnath temple. A look into how the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board is run:</p>
      <p>The Board was set up in 1986 to manage the upkeep of the temple, and currently also runs a university and a hospital. The Amarnath Shrine Board, set up in 2000, is also based on the Vaishno Devi board</p>
      <p>The Jammu and Kashmir governor is the ex-officio chairman of the board, which has 10 members. It is run by an IAS officer</p>
