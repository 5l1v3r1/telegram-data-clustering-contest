      <p>Ernst Middendorp has revealed that he had no choice but to take Reeve Frosler off for Kaizer Chiefs against Orlando Pirates, despite his impressive performance.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is really coming into his own at Naturena in 2019/20 after his first full preseason with the club, and has become Middendorp’s first-choice right-back whenever he’s been fit and available.</p>
      <p>Frosler has been battling a knock recently that forced him to sit out the last two games, but returned with aplomb on Saturday afternoon as he put in a fine showing against the Buccaneers on the way to the 3-2 victory that sent them 10 points clear at the top of the Absa Premiership table.</p>
      <p>Having battled injury though, the youngster was always going to struggle to complete 90 minutes, and not long after he was beaten by Gabadinho Mhango for Pirates’ equaliser, his head coach decided to take him off for Bernard Parker – who went on to win the penalty that won the game.</p>
      <p>Speaking to SuperSport after the game, Middendorp said, “I’m not talking too much about it… If Reeve Frosler - for four or five weeks - is not in training, and we’ve pushed him this week, he can’t play 90 minutes all of a sudden after two or three training sessions.”</p>

      <p>Frosler now has a few weeks to make sure that he’s fully prepared for the upcoming Telkom Knockout semifinal against Maritzburg United where – if fit – he is expected to start in the Amakhosi backline as they aim for a spot in the final.</p>
