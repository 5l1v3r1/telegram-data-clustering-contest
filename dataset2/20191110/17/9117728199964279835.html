        <b>Being a <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver is not easy. The responsibilities, the pressure, the constant talk in the media. Even a Formula 1 veteran would find it hard to drive for Ferrari yet alone a driver in his second season in the sport. This is what has made <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc's</a> success at the team so impressive. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa knows what it takes to put up with the brutality of driving for the Italian team. </p>

      <p><i>“You have to be ready in many respects.

      <p>Ferrari want results and usually don't pick young drivers to race for the team. Leclerc has proved to many that experience is not always necessary to drive a car fast. He has proven to be equally fast as Sebastian Vettel and is definitely one to watch. </p>
