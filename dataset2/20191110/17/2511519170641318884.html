      <p>Actor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/matthew-lewis">Matthew Lewis</a> has lightly mocked his <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></i> co-star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tom-felton">Tom Felton</a> over ageing, much to the delight of their dedicated fans.</p>
      <p>In the <i>Harry Potter</i> film series, the nervous <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/neville-longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, played by Lewis, is frequently derided by the conniving <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/draco-malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, portrayed by Felton.</p>
      <p>However, the tables have turned in the comment section on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>, a fact that may cause any diehard Slytherin dismay.</p>
      <p>During a recent visit to Toronto, Canada, Felton had a photograph taken of himself wearing Slytherin robes while standing alongside a picture of his younger self in character as Malfoy, complete with his signature slicked-back hair.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old shared the photograph on Instagram, alongside the sardonic caption: “Ageing’s a bitch.”</p>

      <p>Lewis, who is good friends with Felton in real life, was quick to pipe up with a mischievous reply, writing: “Speak for yourself lad!”</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old’s comment has garnered more than 20,000 likes, with several Instagram users making the assumption that he was referencing the fact that he “Neville Longbottomed”.</p>

      <p>A few years ago the phrase “to Neville Longbottom” - meaning that someone has become more attractive as they have matured in adulthood - entered popular usage online, inspired by Lewis.</p>
      <p>The <i>Me Before You</i> actor <a href="https://hellogiggles.com/news/matthew-lewis-harry-potter-longbottoming/">admitted</a> he never thought in his “wildest dreams” that he would have “coined a phrase”, adding that he was “quite proud” of it.</p>
      <p>A number of Instagram users mentioned the well-known phrase as they responded to Lewis’ comment on Felton’s picture.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got a whole term named after you, that’s not even fair! We can’t all Longbottom!” one person wrote.</p>
      <p>“The man who aged so well it’s now called ‘Neville Longbottoming’,” another remarked.</p>
      <p>Other Instagram users praised Lewis on his quick wit, several of whom made <i>Harry Potter</i> references.</p>
      <p>“Best response 10 points to Gryffindor,” someone stated.</p>
      <p>“My father will hear about this,” another wrote, alluding to a line frequently said by Malfoy in the <i>Harry Potter</i> book and film series.</p>
      <p>Another Instagram user commented: “Someone get Tom some ointment for that burn. Ouch.”</p>
