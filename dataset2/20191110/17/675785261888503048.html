      <p>This year, the dance will take place at a train station, with loved ones saying goodbye to one another - not knowing whether they will see one another again.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , Aljaž shared a powerful image of him dressed as a soldier, with co-star Karen Hauer seen behind him sat on a bench dressed in similar attire.</p>
      <p>As Aljaž makes his way down the floor surrounded by empty benches, the clock behind him is positioned at 11am - the time in which the war came to an end.</p>
