      <p>Gor Mahia beat arch rivals AFC Leopards 4-1 at the Kasarani Stadium on Sunday to continue their dominance in the Mashemeji Derby.</p>
      <p>Ivorian import Yikpe Gnamian was Ingwe’s chief tormentor – grabbing a brace to announce his arrival to the K’Ogalo faithful on the grandest platform.</p>
      <p>Clifton Miheso, Leopards old boy, and Lawrence Juma were also on the score sheet for the coach Steven Polack’s side.</p>
      <p>Burundian Tresor Ndikumana netted the consolation goal the visitors with a thunderous shot.</p>

      <p>Gor Mahia have now gotten the better of Leopards seven times in the last nine meetings. Ingwe’s last win in the derby was way back in 2016 when they pulled a 1-0 victory.</p>
      <p>The game of two half saw Leopards boss the first half, enjoying a huge chunk of possession, but they failed to get the goal.</p>

      <p>Yikpe broke the deadlock in the 55th minute with a thumping header from a corner kick before doubling the lead in the 63rd minute a cool tap-in after a lovely interchange play with Miheso.</p>
      <p>Miheso turned scorer in the 79th minute with a rasping shot for the third, but Ndikumana reduced the deficit, catching goalkeeper David Mapigano off guard with a long range shot.</p>
      <p>Second half substitute Boniface Omondi set up Juma, who scored the fourth for Gor Mahia with a second touch.</p>
      <p>The win sends Gor Mahia back to the top of the KPL table with 18 points with two games to spare – one point of second placed Kakamega Homeboyz.</p>
