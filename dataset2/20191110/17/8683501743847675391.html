      <p>The news just keeps getting worse for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2469809/terminator-dark-fate"><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i></a>. It had a <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483713/terminator-box-office-dark-fate-tops-the-charts-but-the-numbers-arent-good">disappointing opening last week</a> and a sharp drop in its second weekend at the box office. It also had the worst Friday-to-Friday drop of any other <i>Terminator</i> sequel in the franchise.</p>
      <p>Not a great <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483700/is-terminator-dark-fates-quiet-opening-a-death-sentence-for-that-trilogy-plan">start to a potential trilogy</a>, it must be said.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> opened last weekend to $29 million at the domestic box office. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/09/box-office-james-cameron-and-tim-millers-terminator-dark-fate-starring-linda-hamiton-and-arnold-schwarzenegger-faces-judgment-day-with-74-friday-drop-as-dc-films-joker-nears-1-billion-and-angelina-jolie-in-walt-disneys-maleficent-mistress-of-evil-tops-400-million/#5404d9f5195c">Forbes</a>, it made only $2.8 million on Friday, November 8, marking a 73% drop from opening day on November 1. That's the worst for a <i>Terminator</i> Friday opening, but if we're getting technical about it, <i>Terminator: Salvation</i> decided to open on a Thursday and had an 80% drop in its next Thursday. That was in 2009 and mayyyybe it should've been a hint. The 73% drop is also not quite as low as <i>Batman v Superman</i>'s 81% drop or <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475082/dark-phoenix-had-the-biggest-second-week-drop-of-any-superhero-movie"><i>Dark Phoenix</i>'s truly sad 83% drop</a> in their own second Fridays.</p>
      <p>But at this point, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> is only expected to make just over $10 million this weekend, which would be a drop of 65% from last weekend. That <i>is</i> pretty big considering <i>Dark Fate</i> only started with a $29 million opening weekend. To go back to <i>Terminator Salvation</i>, that movie opened to $42.5 million 10 years ago, so even a slightly bigger week-to-week percentage drop gave it more money than <i>Dark Fate</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> is on track to make about $48 million domestic in 10 days -- just above what 2015's <i>Terminator: Genisys</i> made in five days and what <i>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</i> made in its opening weekend. To be even more brutal about it, Forbes estimates <i>Dark Fate</i> will end its domestic run with around $65-$70 million -- that's about what <i>Rise of the Machines</i> earned here in its first five days in 2003 and what <i>Terminator: Salvation</i> made from Thursday to Memorial Day Monday in 2009.</p>
      <p>Not to beat a dead horse, but that's bad.</p>
      <p>Here are the total worldwide grosses for the other <i>Terminator</i> movies to date, per <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1340138/?ref_=bo_se_r_4">Box Office Mojo</a>, all unadjusted for inflation:</p>
      <blockquote><b>The Terminator</b> (1984)<br/>Domestic: $38,371,200<br/>International: $40,104,771<br/>Worldwide: $78,475,971<br/><b>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</b> (1991)<br/>Domestic: $205,881,154<br/>International: $315,003,693<br/>Worldwide: $520,884,847<br/><b>Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</b> (2003)<br/>Domestic: $150,371,112<br/>International: $283,000,000<br/>Worldwide: $433,371,112<br/><b>Terminator Salvation</b> (2009)<br/>Domestic: $125,322,469<br/>International: $246,030,532<br/>Worldwide; $371,353,001<br/><b>Terminator Genisys</b> (2015)<br/>Domestic: $89,760,956<br/>International: $350,842,581<br/>Worldwide: $440,603,537</blockquote>
      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> picks up from <i>Terminator 2</i>, ignoring the subsequent sequels -- sequels which <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483668/terminator-dark-fate-director-tim-millers-simple-reason-why-other-sequels-were-disappointing">may have been disappointing</a>, but may also make more money.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> cost between $185-$195 million to make, not including marketing costs. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/terminator-dark-fate-linda-hamilton-harriet-motherless-brooklyn-weekend-box-office-1202774477/">Deadline</a>, the movie will have to make $470 million worldwide to break even. If it were making a killing at the international box office, that might happen. But it's not exactly crushing overseas either.</p>
      <p>Going into this second weekend, the film was only at $135 million worldwide, with $94M of that from the foreign box office. That's a lot more than domestic, but the addition of this weekend's numbers, and whatever comes next week and beyond, probably won't be enough to hit that break even point.</p>
      <p>So what do we know? Not many people went to see <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> in Week 1, and the OK-to-good scores out there from fans -- B+ CinemaScore, 84% rating from 8,607 RT users, 6.5/10 rating from 37,303 IMDb users --- didn't convince many newcomers to try it in Week 2.</p>
      <p>So even if you too think you know <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483741/i-think-i-know-exactly-where-james-cameron-is-going-the-with-terminator-dark-fate-trilogy">where James Cameron was going</a> with his <i>Terminator</i> trilogy plans after <i>Dark Fate</i>, it's unlikely now that those plans will see the light of day.</p>
