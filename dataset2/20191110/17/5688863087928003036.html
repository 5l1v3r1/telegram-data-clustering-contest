      <h1>Twitter reacts to the crowd’s ‘Dhoni! Dhoni!’ chant after another Rishabh Pant DRS failure</h1>

        <b>Rishabh Pant hasn’t been having a great run with the bat ever since the Caribbean tour but that’s just a part of his massive pool of troubles. The fact that he has struggled as a wicketkeeper was highlighted again with a failed attempt at DRS and the crowd couldn’t stop chanting MS Dhoni’s name.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/wriddhiman_saha">Wriddhiman Saha</a> has always been able to keep the team and the fans from missing <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a> behind the stumps in the longest format of the sport, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a> is having a hard time even putting up a decent wicketkeeping show. The fans, needless to say, have been clearly unhappy by his blunders behind the wicket. In Sunday’s deciding T20I in Nagpur, it was surprise package Mohammad Naim who was causing India a great deal of trouble. </p>
      <p>Of course, India were desperate to get him out but a hopeless attempt at DRS might have reminded fans of no one else but <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/faf_du_plessis">Faf </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/du_plessis">du Plessis</a> from his recent India tour. Something that a certain MS Dhoni would never do. As <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/khaleel">Khaleel</a> Ahmed bowled a shortish delivery to Naim, it pitched wide outside off and the batsman had clearly missed the shot that he was trying to play. While the umpire signalled wide, Pant was appealing for a caught behind. </p>
      <p>Seeing the gloveman convinced, captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> went for the DRS. Soon UltraEdge would show a flat line and Pant and Sharma covered their faces in shame. As Naim was given Not Out, the crowd started chanting 'Dhoni Dhoni' to remind the youngster of the skills his predecessor possessed while going for the “Dhoni Review System”.</p>
