      <p>Labour’s election coordinator has refused to deny the party would continue to allow uncontrolled immigration from the EU in its prospective Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Labour’s Brexit policy, if it wins the election, is to negotiate a new deal with the EU and put it to the public in a confirmatory referendum.</p>

      <p>However, the party’s election coordinator, and shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne today refused to say whether the deal would end freedom of movement with the other 27 EU member states.</p>
      <p>In the party’s 2017 manifesto, Labour said it would end unfettered immigration with the EU as a part of its Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Gwynne told the BBC: “Let me be very clear, we are looking for reciprocal agreements with the EU 27 that allows British citizens to enjoy some of the freedoms they will lose as a result of Brexit.</p>
      <p>“Things like Erasmus [university exchange program], things like being able to continue working and living in EU states.</p>
      <p>“The quid pro quo is those EU citizens in the UK….will be able to as well.”</p>
      <p>The prevarication comes on the back of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also refusing to rule out an end to freedom of movement at a campaign event.</p>
      <p>Corbyn is set to meet with senior Labour figures on Saturday to finalise the party’s election manifesto.</p>
      <p>“I want to make sure all those EU nationals remain here, can come here, can stay here,” he said.</p>
      <p>Labour’s Brexit policy has been a contentious issue, with many accusing of the party of sitting on the fence.</p>
      <p>Members finally voted to make a second Brexit referendum party policy at its annual conference in September.</p>
      <p>Members voted that if Labour wins government it will negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU, put that deal to a second referendum against a remain option and not officially campaign for either side in that referendum.</p>
      <p>The policy has been criticised by some for being too confusing.</p>
      <p>Home secretary Priti Patel criticised Labour for its refusal to rule out keeping freedom of movement with the EU.</p>

      <p>“For the second time in a week, Corbyn’s Labour have confirmed they want to see uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, whatever the results of the two chaotic referendums they want next year,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The choice at this election is between a Conservative majority government that will get Brexit done and deliver on the people’s priorities like controlling immigration, or a weak coalition headed by Corbyn in a gridlocked parliament that refuses to control immigration.”</p>
