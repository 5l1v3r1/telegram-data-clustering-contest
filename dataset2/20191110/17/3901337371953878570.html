      <p>The Citizens made one change from the side that defeated Polokwane City on Wednesday as Thato Mokeke was brought back into the side, with Roland Putsche dropping to the bench.</p>
      <p>The visitors got off to a blistering start midweek, but it was Leopards who got the opening goal in the 18th minute, with Robert N'Gambi nodding past Sage Stephens.</p>
      <p>City looked to get themselves level and they were nearly rewarded after 27 minutes as Edmilson Dove's deflected effort forced Leopards goalkeeper Jonas Mendes into a superb save.</p>
      <p>Stephens was called upon at the other end 10 minutes before the halftime break, with the City shot-stopper producing a fine save to deny the home side a second goal as the encounter remained 1-0 at the interval.</p>
      <p>However, the Citizens were back on level terms five minutes after the halftime break as Surprise Ralani found the back of the net with a clinical finish from distance for his first league goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Leopards coach Luc Eymael responded with a change on the hour mark, with Joseph Mlhongo making way for Themba Ndlovu just moments after Mwape Musonda squandered an opening for the hosts.</p>
      <p>The home side had to wait until the 83rd minute to restore their advantage as Musonda turned provider to play in Lesedi Kapinga, who calmly slotted past Stephens.</p>
      <p>That proved to be the winning goal as Leopards move up to 11th spot, while City head into the international break in 13th position.</p>
