      <h1>Oscar-Winning Film Director Roman Polanski Mulls Legal Response to French Newspaper Over Rape Claim</h1>
      <h2>Film Director Roman Polanski, who fled the United States for France in 1978 after admitting to the rape of a 13-year-old girl, is facing yet another sexual assault allegation against him.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:04:29+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">by Svetlana Ekimenko</a></address>
      <p>Oscar-winner Roman Polanski is considering taking legal action against French newspaper<i> Le Parisien</i> that published allegations from a former actress that the acclaimed director raped her, according to his lawyer cited by <i>AFP</i> on Sunday.</p>
      <blockquote>"Mr Polanski disputes in the strongest terms this rape accusation," lawyer Herve Temime said in a statement.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"We are working on the legal action to bring against this publication," he said.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier, Valentine Monnier told Le Parisien in <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/une-francaise-accuse-le-realisateur-roman-polanski-de-viol-08-11-2019-8189568.php">a story published on 8 November</a> that she was attacked and raped by the Hollywood director in 1975, aged 18, at Polanski's chalet in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad.</p>
      <p>According to Monnier, she was visiting the chalet with friends in the winter of 1975 but did not know the director personally.</p>
      <p>One night after dinner she claimed the film director called her upstairs, and that’s where she saw him naked.</p>
      <p>According to Monnier’s account of events, Polanski hit her, ripped her clothes off, and raped her.</p>
      <p>The newspaper claims to have spoken to several people who confirmed the actress had shared with them the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201911091077262518-former-french-model-accuses-director-roman-polanski-of-raping-her-45-years-ago--report/">details of the alleged rape</a> shortly afterward.</p>
      <blockquote>“Life had not trained me to be suspicious,” Monnier told Le Parisien.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Rape is a time bomb. The memory does not fade. It becomes a ghost and it follows you, and it changes you insidiously.”</blockquote>
      <p>Monnier, who appeared in several films in the 1980s, claimed she had finally decided to speak out as Polanski's new film "An Officer and A Spy" (J'accuse), centered on the notorious 19th century Dreyfus affair, was set to hit the big screen.</p>

      <p>At his arraignment, Polanski <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201805091064305375-twitter-polanski-sexual-abuse/">pleaded not guilty to all charges</a> but later accepted a plea bargain whose terms included dismissal of the initial charges in exchange for a guilty plea to the lesser charge of engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse.</p>
      <p>Upon learning that he was likely to face imprisonment and deportation, Polanski fled to France in February 1978, hours before he was to be formally sentenced.</p>
      <p>Since then the film director, who has French and Polish citizenship, has mostly lived in France and has avoided visiting countries likely to extradite him to the United States.</p>
