      <h1>Gary Holt delivers telling Steven Gerrard one-liner as he makes offer to Rangers boss</h1>
      <h2>The pair were embroiled in a war of words before the game and it continued after but Holt insists they can have a beer together after the dust settles.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:56:05+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Holt has joked that it was 'very cold' when he shook hands with Rangers boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> prior to Livingston's defeat at the Tony Macaroni Arena but offered his counterpart a cuddle.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Livi boss hit back at Gerrard over comments made asking referee Nick Walsh to protect players better.</p>
      <p>That was off the back of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/joe-aribo">Joe Aribo's</a> head injury during the last meeting between the sides and Holt was left unimpressed.</p>
      <p>In his <i><b>mailSport</b> </i>column, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Holt</a> revealed his anger at how Gerrard had acted and insisted he should behave more like <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> great Walter Smith.</p>
      <p>Gerrard had his own response today when he urged Holt to revisit his press conference as the war of words continued.</p>

      <p>But the pair shook hands before and after the game and when asked if he spoke to Gerrard at the final whistle, Holt said: "I said well done."</p>
      <p>That question was followed up with another asking if the exchange was frosty to which he jokingly replied: "It was cold!"</p>
      <p>He continued: "No, look I always shake hands and say good luck for the game and at the end of the game I'm a big enough boy to accept defeat as well as victories so I congratulated him on his team's performance and to be fair to them, they thoroughly deserved the win today.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I can't put up a fight today and say there was anything naughty or nasty about the game, I just thought they were better in certain areas."</p>
      <p>And will the pair have a beer?</p>
      <p>Holt said: "Aye as always. The door is always opened and hopefully he'll come in and I can give him a cuddle."</p>
