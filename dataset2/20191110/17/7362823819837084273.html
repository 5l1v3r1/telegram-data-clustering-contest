      <h1>Florida county first in state to enact 'Second Amendment Sanctuary' in support of gun rights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:09:22+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Gearty</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/disney-workers-middle-school-principal-florida-child-porn-sting">Florida</a> county has become the first in the state to pass a resolution declaring itself a "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-who-went-armed-to-missouri-walmart-to-test-2nd-amendment-pleads-guilty-to-misdemeanor">Second Amendment</a> Sanctuary" in support of gun rights.</p>
      <p>The Lake County Commission in central Florida approved the measure last week in response to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-dems-assault-weapons-buyback-all-of-them">mandatory gun buyback proposals by Democrats running for president</a>, the <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/lake/os-ne-lake-county-second-amendment-sanctuary-20191108-j3t2f7hohnfnhefl67nklxsknq-story.html">Orlando Sentinel</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The resolution, which passed by a 4-0 vote, says that Lake County’s law-abiding gun owners are safe from having their firearms taken away. The county's other commissioner was absent, but expressed support for it.</p>

      <p>Commissioner Josh Blake was quoted by the paper and other local media as saying that the resolution draws a line in the sand.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t mince words, and I hope it sends a message to what can best be described as the authoritarian control freaks who see it as their job to forcibly disarm their fellow citizens.”</p>

      <p>But a Florida gun control group said the resolution, which Blake sponsored, was meaningless, according to the Sentinel.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s really just posturing by the gun lobby and their supporters,” said Andy Pelosi, who co-chairs The Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence. “It really doesn’t have any teeth.”</p>
