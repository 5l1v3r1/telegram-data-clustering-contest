      <h2>Wolves v Aston Villa | After suffering a triple injury blow before the game, Dean Smith's side suffered another injury only minutes in</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:12:34+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> have been dealt yet another injury blow - with Jed Steer being forced off just five minutes into the match with Wolves.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith was unable to name any of Jack Grealish, Tom Heaton or Bjorn Engels in his squad for the visit to Molineux.</p>
      <p>Only minutes into the game, the 27-year-old winced in pain and appeared in some discomfort after watching Matt Doherty's cross clip the crossbar.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Steer, who came in for the injured Tom Heaton today, immediately signaled to the bench and couldn't put weight on his right foot.</p>
      <p>Orjan Nylaand, Villa's third-choice goalkeeper, comes in for his first bit of Aston Villa match action since Preston in the Championship in December 29, 2018.</p>
      <p>Villa, meanwhile, have been put under pressure by Wolves in the early stages, with Frederic Guilbert booked.</p>
