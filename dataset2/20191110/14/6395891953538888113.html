      <p><b>EXETER, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A small plane has made an emergency landing on a Rhode Island highway.</p>
      <p>State Police say the single engine Rockwell International 112A experienced mechanical problems shortly after taking off from T.F. Green Airport in Warwick at 4:45 p.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>The pilot was headed to Long Island, New York, but had to make an emergency landing on Interstate 95 near Exeter.</p>
      <p>State Police say the pilot changed the plane's direction to avoid landing in the highway's busier southbound side, potentially saving lives.</p>
      <p>The plane landed safely in the northbound lane. The pilot and his passenger were uninjured.</p>
      <p>State Police didn't name the pilot but said he's a New York resident with eight years of flying experience.</p>
      <p>They've also turned over the plane to the National Transportation Safety Board for their review.</p>
