      <p>Facebook apologised on Friday after black employees anonymously shared feelings of workplace bias in an online post.</p>
      <p>The post shared at Medium by a "FB Blind" profile laid out perceived slights by managers, white colleagues, and the human resources department.</p>
      <p>"No one at Facebook, or anywhere, should have to put up with this behaviour," corporate communications vice president Bertie Thomson said in response to an AFP query.</p>
      <p>"We are sorry. It goes against everything that we stand for as a company. We're listening and working hard to do better."</p>
      <p>Incidents described in the Medium post included being targeted for negative performance reviews or snide comments.</p>
      <p>"On the inside, we are sad. Angry. Oppressed. Depressed," the post read.</p>
      <p>"And treated every day through the micro and macro aggressions as if we do not belong here."</p>
      <p>The anonymous post maintained that the atmosphere at Facebook has worsened in the past year when it came to non-white workers being recognised, empowered and treated equitably.</p>
      <p>"The problem is not just with black employees of different genders," the post read.</p>
      <p>"We are remaining anonymous because Facebook creates a hostile culture where anyone that is non-white is made to feel fear for their job and their safety to report any bad behaviours."</p>
