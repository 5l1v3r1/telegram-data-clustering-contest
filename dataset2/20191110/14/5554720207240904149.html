      <p>Critics of Salman Khan on Sunday took to Twitter to accuse the <i>Bigg Boss </i>host of biases against Mahira Sharma and her ‘friend’ Paras Chhabra. They trended hashtag #BiasedHostSalmanKhan after the Bollywood megastar lashed out at Mahira by literally asking her to go to hell. In response, Salman fans launched a counter hashtag by trending #BestHostSalmanKhan. Within hours, more than one lakh tweets were posted on this hashtag making it one of the top national trends in India.</p>

      <p>Salman on Saturday night had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/stop-this-nautanki-theatrics-go-to-hell-salman-khan-launches-stunning-tirade-against-bigg-boss-contestant-mahira-sharma/271980/">lashed out</a> at Mahira for her theatrics in a bid to garner sympathy against Siddharth Shukla. Left embarrassed, Mahira had replied sarcastically, “Ok sir, I will be careful in future. I will stay quiet even when he (Siddharth) shows aggression.” This irked Salman so much that he lost his cool and issued chilling warning to her, “Don’t do this <i>nautanki</i>? Don’t try to fake modesty.”</p>
      <p>Salman had continued, “You were looking so good and remained within the boundary of <i>tameez</i>. What happened to you? You tone has changed. (<i>Bhaand mein jao</i>) Go to hell if you don’t want to pay heed to my advice.”</p>
      <p>Many fans of Mahira felt that Salman was being very harsh on their favourite contestant. One wrote, “The way with which Mahira put forward her points-they always are valid and clear. She puts forward unbiased points. Just b’coz its #biasedhostsalmankhan listening to it he’ll never understand or agree to them#IStandByMahira for being firm with her thoughts even against biasness.” Another commented, “I think it’s better Salman himself comes as a wildcard contestant! Rather than supporting Shukla on weekends he could support him every day by being part of the house!#biasedhostsalmankhan.”</p>
      <p>Within minutes, Salman fans launched another hashtag calling him the ‘best host’ of the Colors TV’s popular reality show.</p>
