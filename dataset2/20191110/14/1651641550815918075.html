      <h1>In-Display fingerprint reader may come to the Apple Watch before the iPhone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:10:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>We have been waiting two years for Apple to catch up with the rest of the smartphone world by <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/report-apple-developing-ultrasonic-in-display-fingerprint-reader/">releasing a device with an in-display fingerprint reader</a>.</p>
      <p>We have previously heard that Apple was developing an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor with Qualcomm which tends to be more accurate than an optical fingerprint reader.</p>
      <p>Now a new patent from Apple suggests that device may be an Apple Watch before it is an iPhone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2019/11/apple-may-shift-apple-watch-antennas-to-the-band-while-adding-touch-id-to-the-display.html">PatentlyApple</a> reports on a new Apple Watch related patent filed in Q2 2018 and published recently.</p>
      <p>The patent focusses on embedding antenna in the watch band (which is likely to kill the 3rd party watch band market), but also notes that the display of the watch may include” “<i>one or more input devices such as a touch sensing device, force sensing device, temperature sensing device, and/or a fingerprint sensor.</i>”</p>

      <p>Currently the Apple Watch relies on a pin system and pairing/proximity to the iPhone for authentication, but given that the Apple Watch can be used to make purchases this is less than ideal, and of course, a bulky system such as Face ID would simply not fit into an Apple Watch, making an Apple Watch Touch-Id solution much more likely.</p>
      <p>Regarding the antenna in the watchband, Apple notes the antenna would need special features, such as being able to stretch, bend, and flex and remain comfortable to use. Given the need to have antenna generally, FCC cleared it is clear that the day of 3rd party watch bands may be coming to an end soon.</p>
      <p>The patent, which includes the Apple Watch Touch-Id reference, can be seen <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/20190341677">here</a>.</p>
