        <b>Donning the name of â€˜Biplopâ€™ on his jersey, Bangladesh international Aminul Islam Biplob has been consistent with the ball so far in the series. But the sitter he dropped, if taken couldâ€™ve sent Shreyas Iyer packing, is yet another example of the visiting teamâ€™s regularity of fielding woes.</b>

      <p>Well, that couldâ€™ve been Shafiul Islamâ€™s third wicket of the evening but it was denied due to absolute poor fielding. After dismissing the danger man <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shikhar_dhawan">Shikhar Dhawan</a> in the third over of his spell, fast bowler Shafiul Islam was looking extremely confident with the ball. The two deliveries after Dhawanâ€™s wicket, in the same over, Shafiul got a chance to bag his third of the evening in the form of the new batsman in - <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a>. Batting at zero, Iyer faced a shortish delivery a little outside off stump to which he edged and sent the ball flying over backward point. That was literally a case of the batsman giving away his wicket in the easiest of ways possible. The fielder just underneath the ball, pleading to be caught, was Aminul Islam. As the ball made its way to Biplopâ€™s grasp, the fielder made a complete mess of it and gave Iyer a lifeline. An initially ecstatic Shafiul was, without a doubt, disappointed.</p>
