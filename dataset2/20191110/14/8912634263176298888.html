      <p>ANKARA: A car bomb in northern Syria killed at least eight civilians and wounded 20 others Sunday in a town near the border with Turkey, Turkey's Defense Ministry said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, air strikes by Syrian regime ally Russia on Sunday killed seven civilians, including three children, in an anti-government bastion in northwestern Syria<br/>The car explosion struck a town south of the city of Tal Abyad, the ministry said. The city was captured last month by Turkish troops and Turkey-backed opposition forces from Kurdish-led fighters.<br/>The ministry blamed Syrian Kurdish fighters for the attack, accusing them of "massacring innocent civilians."<br/>The attack came more than a week after a similar car bomb attack in central Tal Abyad killed 13 people.<br/>Turkey invaded northeast Syria last month to push out Syrian Kurdish fighters near the border. The military offensive has since displaced around 200,000 people.<br/>Ankara considers the Kurdish-led forces to be terrorists because of their links to Kurdish militants fighting inside Turkey.<br/>The Kurdish groups have called in Syrian government forces to halt Turkey's advance.<br/>Despite a shaky truce brokered by Russia, Syrian government forces have since clashed with Turkish troops and Turkey-backed opposition fighters.<br/>Syrian government troops fought for a second day with Turkish-led forces in an area between the towns of Tal-Tamr and Ras al-Ayn, according to a war monitor, Syria's state media and activists. At least four Syrian government soldiers were killed in the fighting Saturday.<br/>A Turkish drone struck a village north of Tal-Tamr Sunday, Syria state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory reported intense clashes not far from Russian patrols.<br/>Russia mediated a cease-fire whereby Syrian government forces deployed along parts of the border but also left Turkey in control of a stretch of land inside Syria.</p>
      <p>In the airstrikes, eight others were wounded and some of them are in a "critical" condition, said Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.<br/>The air strikes - the third wave by Russian aircraft in eight days on northwestern Syria - struck the village of Kafr Ruma in the jihadist-run enclave of Idlib, the Observatory said.<br/>The Idlib region, which is home to some three million people including many displaced by Syria's eight-year civil war, is controlled by the country's former Al-Qaeda affiliate.<br/>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces launched a blistering military campaign against Idlib in April, killing around 1,000 civilians and displacing more than 400,000 people from their homes.<br/>A ceasefire announced by Russia has largely held since late August, although the Observatory says dozens of civilians have been killed in sporadic bombardment since then.</p>
