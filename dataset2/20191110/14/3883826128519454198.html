        <b>Greetings card chain Clintons is considering shop closures and rent cuts as part of a survival plan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The retailer, which has about 2,500 staff, is in restructuring talks with landlords in another sign of the High Street crisis.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman told the BBC no decisions have yet been made.</p>
      <p>Clintons was responding to reports on Sunday that it wanted to close 66 out of 332 shops, with landlords slashing rents on most of the other stores.</p>
      <p>The restructuring would involve a controversial scheme known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows companies to continue trading while pushing through closures and rent cuts.</p>
      <p>A Clintons spokeswoman said "discussions are continuing with our landlords but no decisions have been made".</p>
      <p>But she declined to comment on a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/09/clintons-shut-one-five-greeting-card-chains-332-sites/">Sunday Telegraph report</a> that the company told landlords 90 of its shops were loss-making and that sales were expected to continue to decline.</p>
      <h3>Potential sale</h3>
      <p>One landlord told the BBC that although there was a meeting with Clintons last week, very few details of the restructuring plan were given. More talks are expected this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/card-company-clintons-warns-that-2-500-jobs-are-in-peril-wk7rfxws9">The Sunday Times</a> said landlords would have until 20 December to air their objections to a CVA. However, landlords have taken an increasingly tough stance on the growing use of CVAs and are more prepared to fight demands for rent cuts.</p>

      <p>The retailer, formed in 1968, is owned by the Weiss family, which previously controlled the American Greetings retail chain in the US.</p>
      <p>Clintons, previously known as Clinton Cards, had appointed advisers from consultancy KPMG to explore a potential sale, but it is thought no acceptable offers were received.</p>
      <p>News of Clintons' restructuring comes days after baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>Mothercare is part of a long list of High Street names to go under, including Maplin and Poundworld. Others, including Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright, have been forced into restructuring.</p>
      <p>A string of restaurant chains have also closed amid a squeeze on consumer spending.</p>
      <p>Retail experts expect more pain, however, as firms approach the make-or-break Christmas trading period. It is common for banks to wait until they have a clearer picture of Christmas and New Year sales before pulling the plug on retailers.</p>
