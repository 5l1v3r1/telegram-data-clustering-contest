      <p>Mason Mount believes Chelsea’s youthful revolution will continue to gather pace as the season progresses.</p>
      <p>Second-half goals from Tammy Abraham, 22, and 21-year-old Christian Pulisic secured a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was the Blues’ sixth straight league victory and manager Frank Lampard named the club’s youngest starting line-up in the Premier League, with an average age of just over 24.</p>
      <p>“That’s a brilliant stat and it shows there are a lot of young players coming through who are focused on doing well,” midfielder Mount, 20, told Chelsea TV.</p>
      <p>“It’s that step up – a lot of us want to make that step up and prove we are ready. It’s a massive season for us. At the moment it’s going well and we need to stay focused.</p>
      <p>“It was a massive win.  We’ve had a really good month, with a lot of wins and a lot of good performances, so to finish it off and take a good win into the international break was massive for us.</p>

      <p>“That’s what you need, to keep playing well and staying focused, and then that momentum builds. Then you don’t really think about the game, or winning, you just stay focused.</p>
      <p>“The goals are coming and we’re doing well at the back, stopping goals, so it’s going well.”</p>
      <p>To compound Palace’s misery winger Wilfried Zaha was hobbling at the end, with manager Roy Hodgson hoping it is nothing serious.</p>

      <p>“I think he got caught on the foot, as happens sometimes, and they’re very painful,” said Hodgson.</p>
      <p>“At the moment he’s icing that part of his foot and I suppose we will have to wait and see if anything more serious has been done to him.”</p>
