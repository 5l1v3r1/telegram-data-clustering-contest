      <h1>The Newest Teaser for Westworld’s Next Season Is an Ad for a Menacing Tech Company</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:00:31+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Muncy</a></address>
      <p>Incite, Inc. is here to propel you forward to the future. No, don’t think about the name too much. It’s probably not threatening.</p>
      <p>The new <i><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/westworlds-comic-con-panel-dove-into-the-murky-ethics-of-a-i-in-our-world-and-delos/">Westworld</a></i> ad is a mindbender, and has ARG written all over it. Released yesterday at a WIRED panel called “The Future of Data: The Promise and Peril”, the ad features a promotion for the fictional Incite, Inc., a company that (mysteriously!) also sponsored the real-world WIRED panel. Something mysterious is afoot!</p>

      <p>The ad itself, starring Jefferson Mays as Liam Dempsey, Sr., the co-founder of the company, talks up the vision of a futuristic, post-Silicon Valley company promising “unprecedented computing capabilities, analysing data for life’s most unsolvable problems”. Which definitely doesn’t sound like some <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/westworlds-comic-con-panel-dove-into-the-murky-ethics-of-a-i-in-our-world-and-delos/">techno-dystopian bullshit</a>, nope, not at all. Especially not when he promises that his company’s data can not only solve the climate crisis and find you a satisfying career. Nor when the ad dissolves into an image of a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/the-big-difference-between-westworlds-new-robots-and-old-ones-isnt-just-skin-deep/">robotic, swirling eye</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s also a website for Incite, which has an email sign-up. So far, I’ve not gotten anything from it, but there are surely more clues and teases either hidden in the site now or coming in the future. <i>Westworld</i> fans have always loved guessing games and theorising, after all.</p>
      <p><i>Westworld</i> season 3 premieres early 2020, and whatever’s happening, I’m betting Incite is going to be a part of it.</p>
