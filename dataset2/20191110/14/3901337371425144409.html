      <p>Orlando Pirates interim head coach, Rulani Mokwena accepted that he has critics from all over but revealed that he won’t condone his players being ‘punched.’</p>
      <p>“We can’t go back, we have moved so much in terms of making sure that the Pirates and Chiefs fans sit together in the stadium, we can’t condone such behaviour that it is going to bring us back in to situations where we have stampedes and violence, it can’t happen, if that is what we want as South Africa, then maybe we haven’t learn our lesson, it is not right,” Mokwena told the media after the game.</p>

      <p>Pirates suffered a 3-2 Absa Premiership defeat to Chiefs at the FNB Stadium, where after the match Mokwena was left visibly angry after a late scuffle in the encounter.</p>
      <p>“I have grown up in this country, I know this country and I didn’t leave this country, I didn’t go on a tourism thing so I know what happens in this country, I understand everything that happens and sometimes someone slap me left and right and they think I don’t see but I keep quiet and I move on but you can slap me, it is alright but don’t punch my players,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I know coach Ernst does his homework and I know he is going to watch the incidents also and he is a man of integrity and I think he will accept some of the things that happened on the pitch, as a man of integrity and an honest gentleman.”</p>
      <p>“I have known him for long and he knows the amount of respect I have for him, but I think after he watches, I think the man that I know and the man that is well brought up as he confessed, I think he will come back and say that some of the incidents were unfortunate and shouldn’t be on the pitch,” he added.</p>
