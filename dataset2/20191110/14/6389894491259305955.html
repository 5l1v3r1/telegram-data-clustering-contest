      <p>Lidl’s expansion spree is set to accelerate, with the German discounter planning 230 extra store openings.</p>
      <p>The new store plan, first reported today in the Sunday Times, is the latest in a string of bullish moves from Lidl and Aldi, which have been snapping up an increasing share of the grocery market.</p>
      <p>In a bid to ramp up its rivalry with the UK’s largest supermarket chains, Lidl is pushing ahead with ambitions to grow its footprint to 1,000 stores over the next three years.</p>

      <p>Lidl had previously pledge to open roughly 50-60 stores a year .</p>
      <p>In the summer the group unveiled a £500m expansion plan to establish 40 new stores in the capital, including its first central London outlet.</p>
      <p>The UK’s big four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have faced growing pressure from Lidl and Aldi as they enter new markets in the UK.</p>

      <p>In an attempt to consolidate its market share, Sainsbury’s and Asda sought last year to push through a tie-up.</p>
      <p>However, that was rejected by the UK’s competition watchdog in April this year.</p>
      <p>Lidi first entered the UK market in 1994 and now employs over 22,500 workers.</p>
