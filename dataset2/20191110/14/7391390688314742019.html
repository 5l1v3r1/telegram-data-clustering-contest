      <p>Teeth grinding can happen at any hour. However, Tricia Quartey-Sagaille, D.M.D., FAGD, told Bustle in an interview that grinding at night has the most potential to be harmful because it’s not under a person’s conscious control. Luckily, the <a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-mouth-guards-and-night-guards-for-teeth-grinding.html">best over-the-counter mouth guards for teeth grinding</a> can help <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bruxism/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20356100">separate your top and bottom teeth</a>, preventing the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447347/">jaw pain, headaches</a>, and even tooth damage often caused by grinding. Dr. Marc Lowenberg of Lowenberg, Lituchy &amp; Kantor in New York City told Bustle that <i>anyone</i> who grinds their teeth can actually benefit from wearing a mouth guard, regardless of whether they notice any symptoms. While both experts that I talked to said that the best mouth guard is one that is custom fitted to your mouth by your dentist, an over-the-counter (OTC) pick can still be beneficial (and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/mouth-guards#1">is usually much, much cheaper</a>).</p>
      <h3>Stock Versus Boil And Bite Over-The-Counter Mouth Guards</h3>
      <p>OTC mouth guards typically fall under two categories: one-size/stock and boil and bite.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>One-size/stock:</b> This is usually the cheapest option for a mouth guard and comes ready to use… literally pop it right into your mouth straight from the package. Keep in mind, though, that this option is not fitted to your teeth, so <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/m/mouthguards">some find stock mouth guards difficult to wear</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Boil and bite: </b>A boil and bite mouth guard takes a little bit more work by you initially; the mouth guard needs to be placed in hot water (or boiled) and then placed in your mouth so it can conform to the shape of your teeth. The good thing is that this extra step usually allows <a href="https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/mouth-guards#1">for a better fit</a>. According to Dr. Quartey-Sagaille, “Mouths are individual, which is why a ‘boil and bite’ mouth guard has an edge over the one-sized fits all product.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To help you find the ideal mouth guard for you, here are four highly-rated options on Amazon.</p>
      <h4>1. A Highly-Rated Pack Of Boil And Bite Mouth Guards</h4>

      </p>
      <p>With a stellar 4.6-star rating on Amazon among 950 and growing reviews, this pack of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LC6CYPF?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18812571-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B07LC6CYPF">boil and bite mouth guards from Neomen</a> has many users thrilled about the improvement of their teeth-grinding symptoms. One reviewer wrote, “Very happy with purchase, I was grinding my teeth a lot and waking up with headaches. Now that has stopped! [...] Great product and great price. Really recommend.”</p>
      <p>When it comes to getting these boil and bite mouth guards to fit comfortably in your mouth, reviewers say that the process is actually quite easy. Choose from the included small and large sizes (there are two of each), and take comfort in the knowledge that the guards can be trimmed to sit comfortably in any mouth). To fit the mouth guard, simply heat it up and put it in your mouth so it molds to your teeth (read the instructions for a full step-by-step guide). Then, presto! In just minutes you've got an effective barrier to protect you from the discomfort of teeth grinding.</p>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TD23W2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18812571-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B004TD23W2">Plackers Grind No More Dental Night Guard (10-pack)$13|AmazonSee On Amazon</a>
      </p>
      <p>When an Amazon reviewer claims that a product is “exactly what I needed,” then you know it’s got to be pretty dang useful. And there are many happy customers extolling the virtues of these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TD23W2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-18812571-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=B004TD23W2">one-size mouth guards from Plackers</a>.</p>
      <p>“After trying many different night guards, I finally found one that I can use. Other night guards were too bulky (even the ones that claimed to be smaller), and I couldn’t get used to them - lots of saliva and gagging. Yuck. [...] I have a small mouth and this one was a perfect fit, but the way it’s designed, it would fit a large mouth, too,” wrote one reviewer.</p>
      <p>The disposable mouth guards can be used for the upper or lower teeth, and are ready to use right away, with no warming, cutting, or molding necessary. It’s also a really hygienic pick compared to other options since each BPA-free guard is individually packaged, and you only use it for up to three nights before throwing it away.</p>
