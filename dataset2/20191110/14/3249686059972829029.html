      <p>In the recent Bangtan Bomb entitled, "BTS' sweet piano performance! Shall we listen to it together?' <b>Global Super Group BTS</b> were seen at the House of BTS Pop Up store enjoying themselves with its many amenities, one of which, is the giant piano keyboard where each member took their turns in playing with.</p>
      <p>The highlight of the video however, was <b>BTS V's</b> impressive performance as he played the classic <b>"Celebrated Chop Waltz"</b> without fail- with his feet! </p>

      <p><b>BTS V</b> really loved the piano piece as he was often seen playing it in many occasions, especially when it was mentioned by Suga that he studied it for 8 years in RUN BTS episode 63-64, where it's evident he has mastered it and also seen  playing the same piece in one of RM's Vlives.</p>

      <p>Fans were so impressed by his performance that they even came up with the movie reference similar to what <b>BTS V </b>did, which is from the movie "BIG" starring Tom Hanks.</p>
