      <p>A shop in York has banned cheesy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas">Christmas</a> songs for the sake of staff morale, the owners have said.</p>
      <p>Neither Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You nor Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody will be played this year at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/york">York</a> Gin because having to endure such music for hours each day would ruin Christmas for shop-floor employees, the shop’s director said.</p>
      <p>Emma Godivala said the move would be welcomed by shoppers tired of the constant festive playlist pumped through the speaker systems of many high street shops from mid-November.</p>
      <p>Her shop, which is in a 16th-century Tudor building in the heart of historic York, did not suit modern music, she said.</p>
      <p>“We do love Christmas, but we want our gin shop to be a cheese-free zone. We’ve tested lots of songs to see which sound OK and which sound weird. And there’s a cut-off in the 1960s. Anything after that has been banned.</p>
      <p>“Our lovely team are happy with the decision. They say lots of other shop staff are already going stir crazy with the same Christmas hits being played on a loop. That said, if Mariah appeared in the shop, we might just overturn the ban for a while and play All I Want For Christmas Is You.”</p>
      <p>Instead the shop will play Christmas carols, music from seasonal ballets such as The Nutcracker and classics from Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.</p>
      <p>Sandie Tanner-Smith, the shop’s manager, said: “We’re confident we’ll have the happiest staff and customers around. Our playlist is big enough to make sure no one hears the same Christmas song more than twice in a week.”</p>
