      <p>Speech therapist Christina Hunger from San Diego, California seems to have realised the dream of many dog owners by teaching her dog Stella how to talk.</p>
      <p>To "establish a dialogue" with her, petHunger designed a special device, akin to a keyboard, to help Stella communicate.</p>
      <p>When Stella wants to "speak", she presses the buttons corresponding to the words stored in the device.</p>
