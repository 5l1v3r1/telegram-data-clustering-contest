      <h1>Michael Goodwin: Bloomberg is the great centrist hope for Democrats to defeat Trump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:47:45+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Goodwin</a></address>
      <p>It is said that every senator looks in the mirror and sees a future president, and now Michael Bloomberg is having a similar moment of self-infatuation. Yet far more important than his idealized view of himself is what he sees in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020</a> field of Democrats.</p>
      <p>Insiders from his camp say the former New York mayor doesn’t think any of the three leading <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections">candidates</a>, former Vice President Joe Biden or Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., can defeat President Trump.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the club. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/michael-bloomberg">Bloomberg’s</a> conclusion, although self-serving, reflects a general unease among many Democrats. Mere months ago, the party was celebrating a field of 25 candidates who comprised a Noah’s Ark of group identities, but the mood has changed dramatically.</p>

      <p>After panderfest forums, boring speeches and inconclusive debates, many Dems now sound like Peggy Lee as they ask, “Is that all there is?”</p>
      <p>While most remain wildly enthusiastic about defeating Trump, they are far from ready to unite behind a single candidate. Even worse, the ideological split in the party is so serious that it might not be healed before Election Day.</p>
