      <p>Police are still hunting the sick thug who allowed his dog to maul a helpless cat to death.</p>
      <p>Detectives want to question Amos Price after a lurcher-type was let loose to savage a pet cat in Woodlands Crescent, Pelsall, on October 23. </p>
      <p>The horrifying attack - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/evil-bd-anger-footage-shows-17216215">which has sparked national outcry</a> - was captured on CCTV and reported to police and the RSPCA.</p>
      <p>However despite releasing a mug shot of Price and appealing for the public's help to trace him, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-midlands-police">West Midlands Police</a> officers are yet find the 30-year-old.</p>

      <p>The distressing footage - <b>which can be viewed above</b> - shows a man provoking the dog to attack the cat, called Cleo.</p>
      <p>He can be seen grabbing the dog by the collar and lifting it up to ensure it is aware of the cat, which was sat on a wall.</p>
      <p>Cleo was then dragged from the wall and onto the ground, where the dog sunk its jaws into her, shaking her from side to side before disappearing from shot.</p>

      <p>Heartbroken Gary Truefitt only learned of his beloved pet's death after he reviewed CCTV footage when Cleo - who he had owned for eight years - didn't return home.</p>
      <p>He said: “I noticed my gate was left open, which was suspicious, so I decided to check the CCTV and was completely shocked by what I found. I was very upset, I went to my neighbour's house as I didn’t know what to do.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Cleo will be very much missed, she was a daft cat in lots of ways and would lie along the driveway, even when there were cars about but she was a companion to me. It’s just awful to think of her being attacked in this way.”</p>
      <p>The killing has been branded a "horrifying act of cruelty" by Chief Superintendent Andy Parsons, from Walsall Police as he urged anyone with information about Price's whereabouts to come forward.</p>
      <p>He said: “This is a horrifying act of cruelty which has left us utterly disgusted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I’m aware of the appalling CCTV that captured this shocking behaviour which, like the rest of the community, I wholly condemn.</p>
      <p>“I realise this is highly emotive but I’d urge people to remain calm and help us by coming forward with information on his whereabouts." </p>
      <p>Anyone with any information about the whereabouts of Price, who has not already spoken to police, is urged to get in touch via Live Chat at  <a href="http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/">www.west-midlands.police.uk</a>  between 8am and midnight.</p>
      <p>Alternatively people can call 101 anytime or contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.</p>
