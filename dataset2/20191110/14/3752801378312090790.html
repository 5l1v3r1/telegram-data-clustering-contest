      <p>Bangladesh authorities have evacuated around 100 000 people from the country's low-lying coastal villages and islands with Cyclone Bulbul set to slam into the country later on Saturday, officials said.</p>
      <p>The Meteorological Department has asked local authorities and two ports to raise their highest alert, as the cyclone is expected to unleash a storm surge as high as two metres in coastal districts.</p>
      <p>Bulbul, packing a maximum wind speed of 120km/h (75 miles), is on course to make landfall near the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, which straddles Bangladesh and part of eastern India and is home to the endangered Bengal tigers.</p>
      <p>The cyclone is expected to hit the Bangladesh coast at around 20:00 (1400 GMT), disaster management secretary Shah Kamal told AFP, adding there are plans to evacuate some 1.5 million people before that.</p>
      <p>Authorities have suspended a nationwide school test, cancelled the holidays of officials posted in coastal districts and called off a traditional fair that draws tens of thousands of people in the Sundarbans.</p>
      <p>Operations at the country's two major ports - Mongla and Chittagong - have been suspended, Kamal said.</p>
      <p>Aound 55 000 volunteers have been mobilised to go door to door and alert people about the storm.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh's low-lying coast, home to 30 million people, is regularly battered by powerful cyclones that leave a trail of devastation in their wake.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed over the last few decades in cyclones, whose frequency and intensity have increased.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh has, however, improved its preparedness in recent years, cutting the number casualties since Cyclone Sidr killed more than 3000 people in 2007.</p>
      <p>In May this year, Fani became the most powerful storm to hit the country in five years, but just over a dozen people were killed.</p>
