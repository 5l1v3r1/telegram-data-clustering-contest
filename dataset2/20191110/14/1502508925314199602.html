      <p>Soy bean prices at Indore are trading at Rs 4,040 per quintal. For the week ahead, prices are expected to trade with downward bias and head towards Rs 3,950 per quintal. Weak demand for soy bean meal would slow down demand for processors. Also, arrival pressure is expected to increase once the weather clears.</p>
