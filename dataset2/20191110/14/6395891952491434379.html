      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - U.S. Sen. Jack Reed says $21.6 million in federal funding will be available to help Rhode Island families and seniors with their heating bills this winter.</p>
      <p>The Rhode Island Democrat says the Trump administration is releasing the funding through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.</p>
      <p>Reed encouraged people who need help to sign up early by contacting the state human services department.</p>
      <p>He says the funds are a lifeline for many people, and no one should choose between paying for heat and buying other essentials.</p>
      <p>Reed and U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, led an effort to prevent cuts to the federally-funded program that helps low-income households with their home energy bills, then urged for a quick release of the funds.</p>
      <p>Reed says about 35,000 Rhode Island residents received assistance last year.</p>
