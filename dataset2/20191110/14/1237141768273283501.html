      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:02:08+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Smith</a></address>
      <p>As fall quickly fades into winter, it’s easy to skip a run to stay bundled up on the couch. But taking the winter off can make for a rough spring. In an effort to find motivation to <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/winter-cold-weather-running/">bundle up</a>, we took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4lNrHrnd5Y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram</a> to ask our readers what keeps them motivated to layer up and hit the pavement (or hop on the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20864228/ultimate-treadmill-workouts/">treadmill</a>) during the chilly winter months as the temperature drops and the daylight hours shorten.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s signing up for a future race to keep your goals on track, holding yourself accountable by running with a friend, or looking toward the promise of a hot drink after, here are 33 ways these runners get their miles in even when it’s more tempting to stay by the fire.</p>

      <p>“Agree to run with someone else. Don’t let them down—encourage them to stick to the plan. Warmup before you leave the house—<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a29398654/abs-exercise-mountain-climbers-workout/">mountain climbers</a> and burpees will help when you hit the fresh air with inner warmth.”— <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mac.l.83/">mac.l.83</a></p>
      <p>“My dog; works every time. She loves to run, so we run together.”— <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ktlu14/">ktlu14</a><br/><br/>“I volunteer to take dogs from the humane society for a run. When it get too wet, icy, and cold, I hit the TM. I get hooked on binge-worthy show and ONLY watch when I run.”— <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uplyft.me/">uplyft.me</a><br/><br/>“When we decided to add a dog to the family, I purposely chose one that is high energy so that he’d get me out the door running until it’s not safe for us weather-wise (living in Canada there are a few winter days that aren’t good for either of us).”— <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ajmichalak/">ajmichalak</a></p>

My favorite is to run outside when there’s about an inch of snow. Love the way it feels under my feet!”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tpa5454/">tpa5454</a></p>

      <p>“My all time favorite winter running (and hiking!) tip is to make a big pot of soup/stew/chili in the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/nutrition-weight-loss/g28963291/slow-cooker-soup-recipes/">slow cooker</a> beforehand so I can warm up with a nice, hot meal when I get home. It is seriously <i>so </i>satisfying and what made me fall in love with winter running. If that fails, I make plans to run with a friend (or my cold/snow-loving dog) to keep myself accountable.”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristyandpatronus/">kristyandpatronus</a></p>
      <p>“I always have my clothes ready and go to sleep dreaming about how good that first post-cold-run cup of coffee is going to be!”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/clowe34/">clowe34</a></p>

We run year-round. In Colorado. Brrrrr. It doesn’t take long to warm up, plus then we can get hot chocolate afterward.”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/stitchsgirl/">stitchsgirl</a></p>
      <p>“Fun run hats! I get all layered up then do some jumping jacks until I’m too warm...then the cold feels good! 🤣 Then a reward of a warm beverage when I return.”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/elizabeth5wells/">elizabeth5wells</a></p>

      <p>“I find it harder to motivate myself to get dressed in a billion layers to run in the cold and face the mountain of laundry after than actually run in the cold. Generally I love coming home and getting cozy after a hard effort out in the cold. It’s that much more rewarding somehow and feels very well-earned. So I’d say remember how good it’ll feel to warm up and cozy in following, even if it’s just a few minutes before work or what have you.” —<a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_grainne_mhaol_shuffle/">the_grainne_mhaol_shuffle</a></p>
      <p>“My motivation for running in the cold is to look at the cold differently. It is fun to run in cold weather because you get to dress up in a baggy sweatshirt, and wear the comfiest clothes. I love to run when it is snowing, and there is no wind. It feels like a warm blanket. Those are the days that I go longer distances because I can't really feel the pain. It is peaceful.”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hailey_0225/">hailey_0225</a></p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/health-injuries/a26012855/seasonal-affective-disorder/">Mental health</a>. I know that no matter how much I will dread the cold/dark/snow before heading out, I will not regret exercising in the fresh air and it will make me feel much better physically and mentally.”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/akzanto/">akzanto</a></p>
      <h3>Embrace the Cold</h3>

      <p>“Positive peer pressure! We have a silly chart at work, where you get a star next your name whenever you head out for a run. And we post the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a20857554/do-cold-temps-slow-you-down/">temperatures</a> for each day, too, for extra bragging rights (it was a balmy 16 today!)”—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/goatsheepllama/">goatsheepllama</a></p>
