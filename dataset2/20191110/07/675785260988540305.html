      <h2>Fabinho to return to Liverpool midfield while City contend with injuries to key men for huge six-pointer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool colossus Virgil van Dijk and captain Jordan Henderson are fit to face injury-hit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> after missing training earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Jurgen Klopp will also restore Fabinho to the side for Sunday's Premier League title race showdown after leaving him out for last weekend's win over Aston Villa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fabinho">Fabinho</a> will be back in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> team to help negate City's midfield threat, with Klopp having rested the Brazilian against Villa last Saturday in order to avoid a booking that would have seen him suspended for Sunday's Anfield clash.</p>
      <p>Dejan Lovren will partner Van Dijk at the heart of Liverpool's defence, with the Dutchman's regular first-choice partner Joel Matip still out after suffering a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Liverpool's fearsome front line of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah will all face City. While Mane has been touted by many as the best player in the Premier League so far this season, fans will be expecting more from Salah, who has not yet hit the devastating form he showed in the previous two campaigns.</p>

      <p>City boss Pep Guardiola faces a selection headache, with goalkeeper Ederson out and both Rodri and David Silva likely to be missing from the midfield.</p>
      <p>Claudio Bravo will stand in for Ederson after the Brazilian keeper suffered a muscular injury during City's Champions League draw against Atalanta on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Bravo conceded after coming on for Ederson against Atalanta, while he was sent off later in the match, leaving defender Kyle Walker to go in goal in his absence.</p>
      <p>Guardiola looks set to stick with Fernandinho in the centre of defence with Aymeric Laporte out long term.</p>

      <p>John Stones is likely to get the nod to play alongside Fernandinho ahead of Nicolas Otamendi.</p>
      <p>With Rodri unlikely to play following a thigh injury, Ilkay Gundogan will continue at the base of City's midfield, with Bernardo Silva and Kevin de Bruyne ahead of him.</p>
      <p>Sergio Aguero is likely to be preferred to Gabriel Jesus up front, with Riyad Mahrez and the in-form Raheem Sterling on either flank.</p>
