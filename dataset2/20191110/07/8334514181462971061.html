      <p>Burrow completed 31 of 39 passes with three touchdowns, and he made two crucial third-down runs to keep alive a pair of fourth-quarter scoring drives after the Tide had cut a 20-point deficit to 33-27.</p>
      <p>Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa played despite his gimpy ankle and rallied the Tide to within five points with an 85-yard pass to receiver DeVonta Smith with 1:21 left in the game. Smith earlier had a 64-yard touchdown reception.</p>
      <p>LSU wide receiver Justin Jefferson recovered Alabama’s onside kick attempt, however, and running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire clinched the game with a 12-yard run on first down as LSU went on to run out the clock.</p>
      <p>No. 1 Ohio State 73, Maryland 14</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes made sure the absence of suspended standout defensive end Chase Young was not a factor by dominating the Terrapins in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
      <p>Justin Fields, playing the first half only, was 16 for 25 for 200 yards and three touchdowns and had 28 yards rushing and a score to complement the 90 first-half yards and two rushing TDs by J.K. Dobbins for the Buckeyes (9-0, 6-0 Big Ten).</p>
      <p>OSU backup running back Master Teague added 111 yards on 18 carries. The Terrapins (3-7, 1-6) have lost five straight and were outgained 705-139, including 192-1 in a first quarter in which the Buckeyes led 21-0.</p>
      <p>No. 17 Minnesota 31, No. 4 Penn State 26</p>
      <p>Defensive back Jordan Howden made a sliding interception in the end zone with 61 seconds remaining as the Golden Gophers knocked the Nittany Lions from the ranks of the undefeated in Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>The walk-on’s interception to end Penn State’s late rally moved the Gophers to 9-0 (6-0 Big Ten) for the first time since 1904. The Nittany Lions fell to (9-1, 5-1).</p>
      <p>Minnesota quarterback Tanner Morgan completed 18 of 20 for 339 yards and three touchdowns against the No. 2 scoring defense in the nation. Sean Clifford was 23 of 43 for 340 yards and a score but had three interceptions for Penn State.</p>
      <p>No. 5 Clemson 55, North Carolina State 10</p>
      <p>Trevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes for a fifth consecutive game, and the Tigers rolled past the Wolfpack in Raleigh, N.C., to clinch their fifth straight Atlantic Coast Conference Atlantic Division title.</p>
      <p>The Tigers (10-0, 7-0 ACC) will play the Coastal Division champion in the ACC championship game in Charlotte, N.C., on Dec. 7. Clemson has won each of the last four ACC title games.</p>
      <p>The victory improved Clemson to 10-0 for the fifth time in school history and the third time since 2015. It gave the Tigers a ninth consecutive season with 10 or more wins, which is a school record and tied with Texas for the third-longest streak of 10-win seasons in FBS history. N.C. State (4-5, 1-4) didn’t score until its opening possession of the second half</p>
      <p>No. 6 Georgia 27, Missouri 0</p>
      <p>The Bulldogs posted their third shutout of the season, blanking the Tigers in Athens, Ga.</p>
      <p>With the win, Georgia (8-1, 5-1 SEC) moved one step closer to winning its third straight SEC East Division crown and a berth in the SEC title game, which the Bulldogs can clinch with a win over Auburn next Saturday</p>
      <p>Georgia’s offense was inconsistent — settling for field goals four times — but the defense was stifling. Missouri (5-4, 2-3), playing without injured starting quarterback Kelly Bryant (hamstring), managed only 198 total yards (50 rushing, 148 passing) and 11 first downs.</p>
      <p>No. 9 Oklahoma 42, Iowa State 41</p>
      <p>The Cyclones’ two-point conversion pass that would have given them the lead failed with 24 seconds left in regulation, and the Sooners survived a late comeback bid in Norman, Okla.</p>
      <p>Jalen Hurts threw three touchdown passes and rushed for two more to pace Oklahoma (8-1, 5-1 Big 12), but his late-game interception while holding a seven-point lead gave Iowa State (5-4, 3-3) renewed life.</p>
      <p>Brock Purdy’s 13-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Kolar eight plays later put the Cyclones within a point, and the Sooners’ playoff hopes on the brink. But on the conversion, Oklahoma generated pressure on Brock Purdy, who threw off his back foot into tight coverage, where it was intercepted by Oklahoma’s Parnell Motley on a deflection.</p>
      <p>No. 10 Florida 56, Vanderbilt 0</p>
      <p>Kyle Trask threw for three touchdowns and ran for another, and the Gators outgained the visiting Commodores 560-128 en route to a shutout in Gainesville, Fla.</p>
      <p>Trask completed 25 of 37 passes for 363 yards and two interceptions to help Florida (8-2, 5-2 SEC) rebound from last week’s 24-17 loss to SEC East rival Georgia.</p>
      <p>Vanderbilt (2-7, 1-5) won the time-of-possession battle (33:22 to 26:38) but had fewer first downs (12 to 33), rushing yards (51 to 150) and passing yards (77 to 410) than the Gators.</p>
      <p>No. 12 Baylor 29, TCU 23 (3OT)</p>
      <p>Charlie Brewer hit Denzel Mims for a 4-yard touchdown that scored the deciding points in triple overtime, as the visiting Bears outlasted the Horned Frogs in Fort Worth, Texas, in a wild Big 12 Conference dustup.</p>
      <p>The win allowed Baylor (9-0, 5-0 Big 12) to tie its all-time best start, matching 2013 when it won its first nine games and was ranked No. 3 in the nation. The Bears eventually ended up 11-2, the most wins ever in a season by Baylor, and earned their first-ever Big 12 title.</p>
      <p>The two teams managed just six field goals, three each, and 442 combined yards in regulation. John Mayers’ 51-yard kick with 36 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter sent the game into the extra period tied at 9.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Wisconsin 24, No. 18 Iowa 22</p>
      <p>Jonathan Taylor rushed for 250 yards, and Danny Davis scored two touchdowns to lead the Badgers past the visiting Hawkeyes in Madison, Wis.</p>
      <p>Taylor had 31 carries and became the first player to eclipse the 100-yard mark against the Hawkeyes this season.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin (7-2, 4-2 Big Ten) had to survive a late threat by Iowa. Hawkeyes senior Nate Stanley threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to freshman Tyrone Tracy Jr. with 3:12 left in the game. Down by two, Iowa (6-3, 3-3) was stopped on the two-point conversion attempt.</p>
      <p>No. 15 Notre Dame 38, Duke 7</p>
      <p>Ian Book threw four touchdown passes, including two to Chris Finke, and the Fighting Irish rolled over the Blue Devils in Durham, N.C.</p>
      <p>Chase Claypool and George Takacs also caught touchdown passes for Notre Dame, and C’Bo Flemister added one on the ground. The Irish (7-2) picked up their second straight win. Duke (4-5) lost its third consecutive game.</p>
      <p>Book completed 18 of 32 passes for 181 yards and had two interceptions in addition to his scoring plays. He also led Notre Dame with 12 carries for 139 yards on the ground, including a 53-yard run.</p>
      <p>Texas 27, No. 16 Kansas State 24</p>
      <p>Keaontay Ingram rushed for a career-high 139 yards and two touchdowns, and Cameron Dicker booted the game-winning 26-yard field goal on the final play as the Longhorns shrugged off a slow start and defeated the Wildcats in Austin, Texas.</p>
      <p>Dicker’s game-winner, his second in the past three games at the final gun, culminated a 13-play, 67-yard drive that chewed up the final 6:45.</p>
      <p>Sam Ehlinger was 22 of 29 passing for 263 yards and a touchdown for Texas (6-3, 4-2 Big 12). Skylar Thompson passed for a career-high 253 yards and two touchdowns for Kansas State (6-3, 3-3). He had 217 of those yards and both TDs in the first half; his previous career-high passing was 218 yards.</p>
      <p>Virginia Tech 36, No. 19 Wake Forest 17</p>
      <p>Deshawn McClease ran for two touchdowns as the Hokies knocked off the Demon Deacons in Blacksburg, Va., to maintain control of their destiny in the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Coastal Division.</p>
      <p>Hendon Hooker, who was back after a one-game absence with a knee injury, completed 15 of 23 passes for 242 yards. The outcome took some of the luster off Wake Forest’s visit to Clemson for next week’s Atlantic Division clash.</p>
      <p>Demon Deacons quarterback Jamie Newman, the league leader in several categories, was 16 for 35 for 238 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. He threw both TD passes to Sage Surratt, while Kendall Hinton caught eight passes for 162 yards.</p>
      <p>No. 20 Cincinnati 48, UConn 3</p>
      <p>Sophomore Desmond Ridder tossed two scores to tight end Josiah Deguara, and Michael Warren II ran for another pair as the Bearcats cruised past visiting UConn on homecoming weekend.</p>
      <p>Ridder finished 13 of 23 for 136 yards and contributed 94 yards rushing. Gerrid Doaks had a game-high 123 yards on 13 carries with a score, and Warren totaled 60 yards as the team rushed for 307 yards.</p>
      <p>The Bearcats (8-1, 5-0 American Athletic Conference) recorded their seventh consecutive win in a season for the first time since 2014 and are the only team in the AAC to remain unbeaten in the conference. UConn (2-8, 0-6) suffered its 17th straight conference defeat and has only recorded wins over UMass and FCS school Wagner.</p>
      <p>No. 25 SMU 59, East Carolina 51</p>
      <p>Shane Buechele threw five touchdown passes, and Xavier Jones rushed for three scores to lead the Mustangs to a shootout victory over the Pirates in Dallas.</p>
