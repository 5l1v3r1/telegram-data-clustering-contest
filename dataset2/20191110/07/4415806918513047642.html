      <h1>HSE's senior management team to be cut back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:56:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The head of the HSE has said the agency has too many managers and layoffs will begin in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Paul Reid told the Sunday Business Post that central administration in the health service is "out of kilter" with the needs of the front lines.</p>
      <p>Mr Reid took over as HSE boss just six months ago and today he is making it clear how he intends to make his mark.</p>
      <p>Mr Reid announced that he is cutting the HSE's senior management team back from 23 to just a nine-person executive from today.</p>
      <p>According to the paper, a "systematic cull of HSE managers and administrators will begin in the first half of 2020".</p>
      <p>The paper reports that Mr Reid "said that he believed the HSE had too many managers, and that he would initiate a 'targeted and strategic' redundancy scheme.</p>
      <p>"There may be a possibility of redeploying some staff."</p>
      <p>Mr Reid admitted that the Executive is "not strong at some of the basics of managing people and managing finance".</p>
      <p>He indicated a second round of layoffs might follow in the second half of the year when a restructuring plan is due to be presented to the government.</p>
      <p>He also said the health service will have to offer more money to get the best people for management jobs.</p>
      <p>Last month the INMO claimed that patients were "paying the price for the HSE’s 'go slow' recruitment freeze, which leaves many posts unfilled."</p>
      <p>Reacting to figures that showed last month was the <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/11452-on-trolleys-inmo-warns-of-risks-following-worst-ever-october-for-overcrowding-960867.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">worst-ever October for overcrowding</a>, General Secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said: "I have written to the HSE to warn that their recruitment pause is putting lives at risk.</p>
      <p>"We need to be encouraging more nurses and midwives into our system. Instead, we are making an already bureaucratic recruitment process even more difficult.</p>
      <p>"In many cases, we’re slamming the door on those who want to work in our public health system."</p>
      <p>Last Tuesday saw <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/this-is-simply-obscene-679-patients-waiting-on-trolleys-in-irish-hospitals-highest-figure-of-2019-961932.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">679 patients waiting on trolleys</a> in Irish hospitals, the highest figure of the year so far.</p>
