      <p>Pothole-repair machine is based on JCB 3DX backhoe loader and developed indigenously.</p>
      <p>JCB India, which manufactures earth-moving and construction equipment, has jointly developed a new pothole-repair machine with inputs from the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) – a constituent of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The company showcased the new equipment at the CRRI in New Delhi in the presence of officials from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA), National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and local municipal corporations, among others.</p>
      <p>JCB India says the pothole-repair machine is a one-stop solution for road and highway maintenance.</p>
      <p>The pothole-repair machine is based on the popular JCB 3DX backhoe loader. The machine, along with its set of multifunctional attachments, has been developed indigenously over a year. JCB India says that the solution has been driven by the sector and offers industry-first features designed to transform traditional roads and highway maintenance operations in the areas of safety and productivity.</p>
      <p>Shekhar C Mande, director general, CSIR, lauded the collaboration between CSIR-CRRI and JCB India, as well as the demonstration of the prototype machine to all stakeholders. He urged their feedback to further improve the machine.</p>
      <p>Satish Chandra, director, CSIR-CRRI, stressed upon the need for such equipment for road maintenance agencies in India, and pointed out that this is the first attempt to develop an indigenous pothole-repair machine in the country.</p>
      <p>Subir Kumar Chowdhury, MD and CEO of JCB India, said, “Ever since we started our operations in India four decades ago, JCB machines have contributed immensely towards the creation of roads and highways across the country. There is a need to develop a modern, productive and viable solution for the repair of roads that have been built over time. This new product, developed by us with the support of the CRRI, is based on our popular 3DX backhoe loader. We feel that it will have significant utility in improving infrastructure in India. It will also help in improving safety through the reduction of accidents caused due to potholes.”</p>
      <p>The new model has been designed specifically to meet the needs of roads and highway contractors, the local administration, and rental companies. The machine has a set of JCB attachments and controls, integrated on a 3DX backhoe loader to carry out pothole repairs.</p>
      <p>The innovation was conceptualised one year ago with CSIR-CRRI at JCB India. CRRI has provided its emulsion-based recipe for the filling mix; and this solution is an integrated offering by JCB with its attachment and control solutions on a JCB Backhoe Loader. It does not alter the standard hydraulics, engine power, circuits and electrics of the basic 3DX machine. The electrical circuits for the compressed air and the compactor attachment are fully integrated.</p>
      <p>JCB India says the machine will also be fitted with JCB’s advanced Telematics Technology 'Livelink', which will help in exact monitoring of progress of repair projects as it will enable real-time updates of the machine movement, location and its operations.</p>
