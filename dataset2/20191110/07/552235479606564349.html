      <p>An Uddingston rowdy was warned this week that his “strange and bizarre” behaviour has put him on the verge of a prison sentence.</p>
      <p>John Burns admitted smashing a window with a brick at the Blue Triangle homeless unit in Old Edinburgh Road, Viewpark, on February 27.</p>
      <p>He also admitted kicking a door there repeatedly and throwing a can at a police car.</p>
      <p>Hamilton Sheriff Court heard Burns was shouting for residents to come out of the building.</p>
      <p>A support worker saw him pick up a brick and smash a window with it.</p>
      <p>The police were contacted. Officers arrived and saw Burns drinking from a can which he then hurled at the windscreen of the police vehicle.</p>
      <p>Burns, 21, of Deanbrae Street, Uddingston, also admitted throwing an aerosol can at a police officer in Logan Street, Blantyre, on September 21. He was the subject of two bail orders at the time.</p>
      <p>The missile failed to find its target.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Diarmid Bruce told the court his client has “issues”.</p>
      <p>The solicitor explained: “He has been using drugs and his mental health is fragile.</p>
      <p>“As a result, this strange and bizarre behaviour has taken place.</p>
      <p>“His family are keen to steer him in the right direction.”</p>
      <p>After studying background reports, Sheriff Allan McKay told Burns: “You are a broadly intelligent man, but when you take alcohol and other substances you lose your mind.</p>
      <p>“You need to stay off what triggers your anti-social behaviour as you are on the verge of going to prison.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff said he was prepared to impose a community payback order as a direct alternative to custody.</p>
      <p>Burns will be supervised for a year, must attend addiction counselling and has to do 100 hours of unpaid community work within six months.</p>
      <p>He will also be electronically tagged for 45 days which means he’s confined to his home between 8pm and 6am each day.</p>
