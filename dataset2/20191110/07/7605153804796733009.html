        <b>MANCHESTER, United Kingdom, Nov 9<i> – </i>Pep Guardiola has “never” felt like an underdog and insists even a daunting trip to face Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday will not alter his belief in his Manchester City side.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Guardiola takes City into Sunday’s clash with everything seemingly in favour of the home side.</p>
      <p>The European champions have a six-point advantage at the top of the Premier League and have lost only one –- a 2-1 defeat by City back in January — of their last 50 league games.</p>
      <p>Guardiola must also do without goalkeeper Ederson for the match at Anfield, with the Brazilian having picked up a muscle injury in the midweek draw away to Atalanta in the Champions League, to add to the losses of Aymeric Laporte, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Rodri to injuries.</p>
      <p>But the City manager still believes that his players can achieve only their second win at Liverpool’s ground in the last 38 years.</p>
      <p>Guardiola, who has won 28 trophies in his career as a manager at City, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, said: “What does it mean to be an outsider?</p>
      <p>“People say ‘you’re an outsider or not, an underdog or not’. But I’ve never gone into a game feeling like an outsider and feeling like I’m not going to win. I never felt that.</p>
      <p>“Of course, they are in a position six points ahead, they are playing fantastic all season and we have many problems in some departments.</p>
      <p>“But I’m not going to take the bus to Anfield thinking I’m going to lose the game. That has never happened in my career.</p>
      <p>“I always had the feeling that if we do the special things we plan to do, we will have our chance to win.”</p>
      <p>City have already suffered two shock losses in the league this season to Norwich and at home to Wolves to leave themselves playing catch-up to Jurgen Klopp’s team with only 11 games gone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– ‘We need our best’ –</b>
      </p>
      <p>And Guardiola knows it will take one of the best displays from his time at City to inflict a first home defeat in the league on Liverpool since April 2017.</p>
      <p>“We know we need our best performance,” he says.</p>
      <p>“To win this kind of game, you have to be at the top level, definitely. We can’t be half and half.</p>
      <p>“The way they play, they demand incredible attention in the all the details for 95 minutes. We know that.</p>
      <p>“But that is the point. I’m pretty sure that if there’s a chance to win at Anfield, it’s when you believe you’re going to win the game.</p>
      <p>“If you think, ‘Let’s just see what happens’, against that team there, I think it is not possible.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola has lost three and drawn only one of his four visits to Anfield during his time in charge at City.</p>
      <p>The Sky Blues’ last victory there came courtesy of two goals from former France international Nicolas Anelka in May 2003.</p>
      <p>Club greats like David Silva and Sergio Aguero have never won there, and the Argentine -– City’s all-time leading goalscorer -– has never even scored there.</p>
      <p>“I cannot explain it,” says Guardiola. “I can only explain the period when I was here.</p>
      <p>“I would try to tell the players what they have to do and focus on what we have to do to win the game in mental approach and tactical decisions.</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe much in statistics but 38 years for one time means how difficult it is at Anfield.”</p>
