      <h1>Chelsea up to second as Tottenham falter once more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:32:44+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>LONDON: </b>Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 2-0 to move up to second in the Premier League on Saturday, while Tottenham’s troubles continued with a 1-1 draw at home to Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>League leaders Liverpool host Manchester City in a highly-anticipated clash between the champions of Europe and champions of England at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Chelsea took advantage of kicking off a day earlier to move a point ahead of City and close to within five of Liverpool with a patient performance to break down a defensively dogged Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham moved level with Leicester’s Jamie Vardy as the top scorer in the Premier League with 10 goals as the England striker pounced on a deft flick through by Willian seven minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Christian Pulisic then secured all three points when the American headed home his fifth goal in his last three Premier League games.</p>

      <p>“We won the game relatively comfortably,” said Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. “A nice, solid win with a clean sheet.”</p>
      <p>Leicester can leapfrog Lampard’s men on goal difference and open up a nine-point gap between fourth and fifth with victory at home to Arsenal later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Tottenham slipped to 12th and were lucky to even escape with a point as Sheffield United impressed once more to move up to fifth.</p>
      <p>“The reality is that for different reasons we are not showing the performances that we expect,” said Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“We are not in a good position in the table.”</p>
      <p>A rare defensive error from the Blades set up Son Heung-min to open the scoring with his eighth goal of the season just before the hour mark.</p>
      <p>David McGoldrick thought he had levelled almost immediately, but after a three-minute delay the goal was ruled out for John Lundstram being millimetres offside in the build-up.</p>
      <p>To their credit, Chris Wilder’s men were not downhearted and survived another VAR review when George Baldock’s cross from the right evaded everyone and found the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>“I’m more interested in the recovery of my players, how they went for the jugular to try and get back in the game,” said Wilder on the VAR controversy.</p>

      <p>West Ham’s woes continued as Manuel Pellegrini’s men were beaten 3-0 at Burnley to stretch their winless streak to seven games.</p>
      <p>Ashley Barnes opened the scoring after 11 minutes as Burnley never looked back.</p>
      <p>Chris Wood doubled the hosts’ advantage after earlier having a goal ruled out by VAR for offside and a miserable day for the visitors at Turf Moor was summed up when goalkeeper Roberto punched a corner into his own net.</p>
      <p>“When you concede so many easy goals it does not help,” said Pellegrini.</p>
      <p>Everton moved six points clear of the relegation zone thanks to a 2-1 win at Southampton to ease the pressure on Marco Silva.</p>
      <p>Tom Davies gave the Toffees the perfect start at St Mary’s before Danny Ings equalised early in the second half.</p>
      <p>But Richarlison struck the winner 15 minutes from time to secure Everton’s first away league win since March.</p>
      <p>Newcastle are now seven points clear of the drop zone as they came from behind to beat Bournemouth 2-1 at St James’ Park thanks to goals from DeAndre Yedlin and Ciaran Clark.</p>
