      <h2>The biggest game of the Premier League season so far sees Liverpool and Man City face off in a clash that could be pivotal in the title race</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:20:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>Table-topping Liverpool take on Premier League champions Manchester City in what could be a deciding fixture in the race for the title.</p>
      <p>The Reds have picked up 31 points from a possible 33, having won every match at Anfield this season.</p>

      <p>As for the visitors, they come into the match on the back of a struggling performance at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>Yet, only one team has been able to shut out City this season with the Sky Blues netting at least two goals in every other fixture they’ve played.</p>
      <p>With 11 matches of the season already gone, you’d imagine it’d be one of these two lifting the Premier League trophy in May.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know ahead of this crucial fixture…</p>
