      <h1>Meghan Markle, Prince Harry could already be planning for baby number 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:08:58+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have already planned to have two children maximum, and now, the Duke is Sussex is dropping hints that it might happen sooner than we think.</p>
      <p>During an outing on Wednesday to surprise military families in Windsor, Prince Harry reportedly asked fellow parents what it’s like to add a second child to the family, reported <i><a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/meghan-markle-prince-harry-second-baby-hints">InStyle</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“Harry was really quite interested in how things were with second children as well, because we both have older children,” Susie Stringfellow told <i>Forces Network</i>.</p>

      <p>She added she and the other parents were “trying to encourage him to have a second baby.”</p>
      <p>In an interview in July this year, Harry told Dr. Jane Goodall that he and Meghan were planning to have “two [children], maximum,” in an effort to be more conscious of humans’ impact on the earth.</p>

      <p>“I’ve always thought: this place is borrowed,” he said at the time. “And, surely, as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation.”</p>
      <p>Their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born in May, and has already made his royal tour debut with his parents during their tour of Africa in September.</p>
      <p>If Harry’s questions for his fellow parents are anything to go by, it sounds like the Sussexes could already be imagining life as a family of four.</p>
