        <b>Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana laid a solid foundation with brilliant half centuries as the Indian eves overcame the West Indian challenge by 84 runs in the first T20I. The openers helped India post a daunting total of 184 which was easily defended as the Windies were restricted to just 101.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Brief Scores:</b> India Women 185/4 in 20 overs (Shafali Verma 73, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/smriti_mandhana">Smriti Mandhana</a> 67; Anisa Mohammed 2/35, Shakera Selman 2/36) beat West Indies Women 101/9 in 20 overs (Shermaine Campbelle 33; Radha Yadav 2/10, Shikha Pandey 2/22) by 84 runs.</p>
      <p>15-year old Shefali Verma went in to bat with Smriti Mandhana as India batted first in the first T20I against the West Indies and staged a massive opening partnership of 143. Shafali scored 73 of just 49 balls which included 6 fours and four sixes and was ably supported by Mandhana who scored 67 of 46 balls which included 11 boundaries. Anisa Mohammad and Shakera Selman struck with 2 wickets each as India were reduced to 157/4 from a position of 143/0 and it seemed that the bowling team will be able to restrict them to an achievable total. However, late hitting from skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/harmanpreet_kaur">Harmanpreet Kaur</a> and Veda Krishnamurthy ensured that India posted an above-par total of 184 in their 20 overs.</p>
      <p>The West Indies' openers needed to give their team a good start and a strong powerplay was required for the West Indies women to be ahead in the chase. But that was not meant to be as Shikha Pandey bowled great line and length to dismiss young Hayley Matthews. Fellow opener Natasha <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/mcl">McL</a>ean was sent packing for a duck by Radha Yadav. Wicket-keeper Shemaine Campbelle was the only one batter who looked in some kind of form as she tried to hold the innings together with a valiant 33, but once she was run-out the wheels came off for the West Indies batting. All they could muster was just 101 runs in their 20 overs, slumping to a massive 84-run defeat at the hands of the visitors and helped them take a 1-0 lead in the five-match T20I series. Shikha Pandey, Poonam Yadav, and Radha Yadav picked up 2 wickets each with Radha being the pick of the bowlers with astonishing figures of 2 for 10 off her four overs. </p>
