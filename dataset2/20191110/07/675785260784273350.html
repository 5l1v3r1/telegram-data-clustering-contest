      <h1>Pep Guardiola knows the two Liverpool players Man City must stop</h1>
      <h2>City must cut the supply lines from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson to have a chance of beating Reds</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:21:23+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:21</time> by <a rel="author">Stan Collymore, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/stan-collymore/</a></address>
      <p>A lot of people will look at today’s mouthwatering clash between Liverpool and Manchester City and assume it’s the strikers who hold the key to victory.</p>
      <p>That the game will be won or lost depending on the performances of Sergio Aguero and/or Gabriel Jesus, or Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino.</p>
      <p>Those boys will be crucial to the outcome, of course, but of even more importance are the battles in midfield and out wide between the wingers and the wing-backs.</p>
      <p>That’s where the supply lines run for both sides and if they are cut then it won’t matter what positions the hitmen are in if the ball isn’t reaching them.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , the performances of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson will be critical.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They are arguably the best two full-backs in the world and, as a ­former striker, I can tell you the ­accuracy of the crossing is tantalising.</p>
      <p>I did notice against Newcastle and Aston Villa that for two thirds of both games neither really got forward into attacking positions with any ­regularity and both times Liverpool really had to work hard for victory.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola will have looked at those games and realised that two sides who are likely to finish in the bottom half of the table were both able to negate them to some extent.</p>
      <h3>Easier</h3>

        <figcaption>The supply line for City will come through the middle, from the likes of Kevin de Bruyne (Image: AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>So if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> are able to keep the pair of them around their own halfway line, or inside their own half for long periods, then they will be favourites to win the game.</p>
      <p>The supply line for Guardiola’s boys will then come through the ­middle of the park, where they will find it easier to cut through whoever Jurgen Klopp goes with from Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Gini Wijnaldum and Fabinho, than they would find going past Alexander-Arnold or Robertson.</p>
      <p>So if City are to win they will do so within the lines of the 18-yard box, while if Liverpool are to take the ­honours it will be outside of them.</p>
      <p>If the latter happens and Klopp and his boys are celebrating come the final whistle then there will be plenty of Reds ­proclaiming the title is theirs - that a nine-point lead will be unassailable.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But that won’t be the case and, if you don’t ­believe me, wait and see how many bookies pay out on my old club as ­champions this week.</p>
      <p>I won’t really start to believe until we’re into March with a nine-point lead. Because this City group is just too good to be written off.</p>
      <p>I didn’t read too much into Guardiola’s talk of diving from Mane and Liverpool as a whole, either, because that ship sailed a long time ago and they are more ­disciplined these days.</p>
      <p>The only thing I could ­imagine Guardiola was trying to do was a bit of sabre-rattling that maybe got his own group going rather than rattle Klopp and Co.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It was a bit strange for him to say something like that and it certainly wasn’t peak-time Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger or Jose Mourinho as I suspect he knows that mind games are dead these days, anyway.</p>
      <p>What I don’t see happening is goals flying in for either side like they did for Liverpool 19 months ago in the Champions League.</p>
      <h3>Tentative</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It will be more tentative and both sides will probably be pretty happy with a draw.</p>
      <p>City are in a great place – they haven’t been amazing in every game, they have had their bumps, lost goalkeepers and had injuries to key players.</p>
      <p>But even so, the reality is that if they beat Liverpool they will only be three points behind and if someone says in November, ‘Are you happy with a three-point lead over City,’ the honest answer is, ‘Hell, no!’ At this stage, it is absolutely all to play for.</p>
