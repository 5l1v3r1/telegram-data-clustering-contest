      <p>John Gokongwei Jr., one of the Philippines’ original taipans who built a giant conglomerate from scratch, passed away at the age of 93.</p>
      <p>The news of Gokongwei’s passing was confirmed by his son Lance Gokongwei through a text message to Esquire Philippines.</p>
      <p>“Our beloved husband, father and grandfather John Gokongwei, Jr. passed away peacefully 11:41 pm, November 9th, at the Manila Doctor’s Hospital surrounded by his loved ones. Please pray for the repose of his soul. Details of his wake to follow. Rest In Peace, Mr. John,” Esquire Philippines quoted Lance Gokongwei’s message.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei Jr. founded JG Summit Holdings Inc., one of the country’s largest conglomerates with interests in air transportation, telecommunications, petrochemicals, banking, food, power, property and hospitality, retail, and media.</p>
      <p>He was ranked third in Forbes’ list of richest Filipinos in 2019. As of November 9, his net worth was at $5.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei was 15 years old when he had to leave school and work for the survival of his family after the death of their father. He started by peddling soap, candles and thread in a distant town in Cebu where he would earn a profit of about P20.00 a day.</p>
      <p>“The pesos I made in the palengke were the pesos that went into building the business I have today. After this experience, I told myself, If I can compete with people so much older than me, if I can support my whole family at 15, I can do anything!” Gokongwei once recounted.</p>
      <p>In 1943, Gokongwei started trading goods, travelling the whole day to bring tires to Manila and then buying other goods to sell back in Cebu. After the war, he put up Amasia Trading which imported food and dry goods from the United States.</p>
      <p>It was in 1957, at the age of 31, that Gokongwei took out a P500,000 peso loan to start a corn-starch business to take on leaders in the business by starting a price war. His Universal Corn Starch products was the survivor and became the start of Universal Robina Corporation which now has interests in food and beverage manufacturing in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
      <p>In 1990, Gokongwei placed all of his major business under the flagship JG Summit Holdings, Inc. which went public and listed its shares at the Philippine Stock Exchange in 1993.</p>
      <p>He recounted that they decided to go public to raise capital to fund its pan-ASEAN ambitions as well as to put the company “under the spotlight of the public eye” so it will be under pressure to perform.”</p>
      <p>“On the other hand, remaining family-managed would imbue the business with the stability, strong culture, and long-term vision necessary to see our investments bear fruit,” Gokongwei noted.</p>
      <p>He said this balance has “allowed JG Summit to forge its own path, despite naysayers, who did not understand our investment choices at first and believed we were not focused enough.”</p>
      <p>“It allowed us to stick to our guns, and invest in industries like transportation, power, and telecommunications which would be essential not only for our growth as a company but as a nation as well,” Gokongwei said.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei built his name as a game changer in Philippine business when he decided to venture into the telecommunications, airline and beverage businesses where he took on established giants in the industry.</p>
      <p>Through Digital Telecommunications Inc., he introduced Sun Cellular which challenged the dominance of PLDT’s Smart Communications and Globe Telecom in the mobile telecommunications. The price war that ensued brought the cost of wireless communications down and made it more affordable for more Filipinos.</p>
      <p>He then trained his sights on the airline industry in 1996, which was virtually monopolized by Philippine Airlines, by putting up the country’s first low cost carrier Cebu Pacific which brought down the cost of air travel and made it so affordable that even the shipping industry lost its passengers to the budget airline. Cebu Pacific is now the country’s largest airline in terms of domestic flights, routes and passengers while constantly building up its overseas business.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei also changed the local beverage industry when URC introduced the bottled tea drink C2 as an alternative to the popular soda brands of Coca-Cola and Pepsi and this caused a major shift in consumer preference to non-carbonated bottled drinks. After shaking up the local beverage industry, C2 is now among URC’s flagship products making inroads to other markets in southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>After enjoying immense success in business, Gokongwei decided to give back in a bigger way by donating half of his stake in JG Summit, worth about P20 billion in 2006, to the Gokongwei Brothers Foundation. At 80 years old, he declared that he will focus in philanthropy after turning over the reins of his business empire to his younger brother James and children led by son Lance.</p>
      <p>The foundation aims to have a lasting impact on education in the Philippines as Gokongwei had always valued education.<br/>A scholar of University of San Carlos as he was always at the top of his class from primary school to high school, Gokongwei had also been learning from the school of life as he worked so his siblings can continue studying in the best schools that he could afford at that time.</p>
      <p>After reaping the rewards of his hard work and having started his business empire, Gokongwei went back to school and earned his MBA from De La Salle University.</p>
      <p>Having an intimate knowledge of how education can make a difference because of his own struggles against many challenges, Gokongwei had found a yearning to help build institutions for learning as well as give the underprivileged a boost in life through scholarships.</p>
      <p>“From the beginning, I knew that education would be the foundation’s primary advocacy. Why? Because it is my belief that education is the only way to save this country. We need quality education to compete in this world,” he noted.</p>
      <p>In particular, Gokongwei said GBF is committed to support education in science and engineering because “that’s the only way to help our country industrialize.”</p>
      <p>GBF’s approach to its mission is two-pronged: it collaborates with leading educational institutions to build the quality of instruction while granting scholarships to worthy and underprivileged students.\</p>
      <p>In honor of GBF’s endowments, Ateneo University and De La Salle University renamed their departments the Ateneo de Manila John Gokongwei School of Management (2002) and the De La Salle University Gokongwei College of Engineering (2011), respectively. These endowments consist of significant allocations for student scholarships and faculty research.</p>
      <p>The DLSU endowment has also led to the establishment of the John Gokongwei, Jr. Innovation Center (DLSU-JGIC) at the DLSU Science and Technology Center in Biñan, Laguna. Inaugurated in 2018, DLSU-JGIC partnered with a global gaming giant to offer undergraduate degrees in interactive entertainment, among many other new courses in this center.</p>
      <p>The Gokongwei family has also donated funds to other academic institutions such as Immaculate Conception Academy, Xavier School, the University of San Carlos, Sacred Heart School-Ateneo de Cebu, and the University of Asia and the Pacific.<br/>Meanwhile, scholarship programs help fulfill GBF’s desire to give deserving young people a better future through purposeful, practical, and transformative education.</p>
      <p>Since 2006, GBF has offered scholarship programs producing 337 graduates as of September 2017. At present, GBF offers seven scholarship programs for college, technical-vocational, and high school students.</p>
