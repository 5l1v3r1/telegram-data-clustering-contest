      <p>REUTERS: Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Adama Traore has been handed a late call-up to the Spain squad for the first time ahead of their final Euro 2020 qualifiers against Romania and Malta after Rodrigo Moreno was forced to withdraw due to injury.</p>
      <p>Rodrigo injured his back during Valencia's 2-0 win over Granada on Saturday and a statement on the Spain team's official website said coach Robert Moreno had turned to the 23-year-old in his place.</p>

      <p>Traore came through Barcelona's youth academy but only made one La Liga appearance for the first team, moving to English side Aston Villa in 2015.</p>
      <p>The forward, who has turned out for Spain's Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 sides, has scored twice for Wolves this season, both goals coming in a shock 2-0 win at Premier League champions Manchester City in October.</p>
      <p>Spain, who clinched their place at Euro 2020 last month, host Malta on Nov 15 before ending their Group F campaign at home to Romania on Nov 18.</p>
