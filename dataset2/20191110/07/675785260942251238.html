      <p>Manchester United take on Brighton in the Premier League as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer continues to fight off pressure on his job.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils currently lie tenth in the table having only won twice at home all season.</p>
      <p>But with both those wins coming against top four opposition, it’s teams outside the European places who United have struggled to break down.</p>
      <p>As for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> , they’ve won three of their last four matches and have climbed above United and into the top half of the division.</p>
      <p>After a slow start, Graham Potter has finally got the football and the results he wants from his team.</p>
      <p>Here’s all you need to know ahead of the match...</p>
