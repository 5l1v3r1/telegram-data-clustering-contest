        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 10 – The Kenya Harlequins vs Western Bulls match seemed to be a one sided fixture from the onset with Quins being the clear favourites to claim the victory at the end of match day three.</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Echulusi</i> however showed up to this encounter in search of a win that they clearly worked and earned in the last 40 minutes of the match beating Quins 21-19.</p>
      <p>Iddris Kakai was first on the scoreboard for the Kenya Harlequins giving them an early 7-0 lead after Eric Shikuku’s conversion sliced the posts.</p>
      <p>The electric combination of Patrice Agunda and David Ambunya were next on the score sheet with a try each that were followed by Shikuku converting Agunda’s try and missing Ambunya’s for a 19-0 half time score.</p>

      <p>In relentless fashion, Derrick Ashiundu’s hat trick bolted Bulls from a 0-19 deficit to a 21-19 full time score as all conversions were successful in the second half, claiming their first victory of the season.</p>
      <p>Kabras Sugar, KCB and Homeboyz are the three sides that have won all their matches so far and are placed first, second and third respectively on the Kenya Cup standings table.</p>
      <p>Kabras beat Impala Saracens 25-3 at the Kakamega Showgrounds, KCB handed Nakuru a 13-50 loss in Ruaraka while Homeboyz survived an Oilers scare to secure a 25-20 win at the Jamhuri Showgrounds.</p>
      <p>The Blad Bin fans were served to a high scoring match as Kenyatta University’s Blakblad welcomed Nondies to their backyard.</p>
      <p>Nondies who were fresh from a painful 17-19 loss to Kisumu last weekend ensured they were the better side as they won that encounter 38-23.</p>
