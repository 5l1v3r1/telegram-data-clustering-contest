      <p>Head of recruitment John Marshall has refuted those claims, however, and insists the Swede isn’t someone who is currently on Wolves’ radar.</p>
      <p>“I also read this indiscretion, but it is not true,” <a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/tmw-wyscout-marshall-wolves-cutrone-e-gia-un-idolo-no-a-kessie-1314249?fbclid=IwAR2efKnlPJDEqp07R5hh9hMOJnr53E4RkwVEPnmnnGxYzMDfSqJTv72Iz50">Marshall told TMW at a scouting convention in Amsterdam.</a> “He is not a player that interests us."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> dipped into Serie A during the summer to sign Patrick Cutrone, Bruno Jordao and Pedro Neto, with the former signed from AC Milan for a fee that will reach £20million.</p>
      <p>On Cutrone, Marshall said: "He has everything to become more and more a protagonist of our reality. And besides he is a player much loved by the fans, in the field he always gives everything. We are very satisfied with him.”</p>
