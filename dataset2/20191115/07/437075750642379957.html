      <h1>Bafana’s Afcon campaign is rattled by an impressive Ghana</h1>

      <p>South Africa began their 2021 Afcon qualifying campaign on a low following a 2-0 thumping by Ghana in their opening group fixture on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Two superb goals in each half by the hosts settled the game at a packed South Coast Stadium to mark a rather terrible start for new Bafana Bafana head coach Molefi Ntseki, who will now be desperate for a win against Sudan in Soweto on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Things went awry for Bafana the moment they lost midfielder Bongani Zungu to injury just before the hour mark.</p>
      <p>The void was apparent as Ghana exploited the centre of the park and that’s where Spain-based midfielder Thomas Partey took his chance with a low shot that took a wicked deflection to beat Ronwen Williams in Bafana goal.</p>
      <p>South Africa had their moments in the opening stages when Bradley Grobler came close with a snap shot from close range following a free-kick in a game where Bafana were easily bullied by the Black Star when it came to territorial control.</p>
      <p>At the heart of Ghana’s impressive build-ups were the Ayew brothers – captain Andre and Jordan – who were at their best, inspiring the attacks of their side.</p>

      <p>Despite the team being under siege, Ntseki was adventurous in his substitutions when he threw in Lebo Mothiba for Grobler and Kermit Erasmus for Thembinkosi Lorch in a bid to claw back into the game.</p>
      <p>But it was Ghana who ended the tie as a contest when debutant Mohammed Kudus found ample space while running through the midfield to rifle home with less than 10 minutes before full time.</p>
      <p>With this victory, Ghana took the second spot in Group C behind Sudan, who lead the pool after their 4-0 win over Sao Tome and Principe on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Bafana are expected back on Friday to prepare for Sudan at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.</p>
