      <h1>Top-5 notebook vendors see shipments dip 13% in October, says Digitimes Research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:44:04+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Hsiao, DIGITIMES Research, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>The worldwide top-5 notebook brands saw their combined shipments slip 13% on month in October 2019, better than that of the same month a year ago, thanks to some lingering seasonal demand and some brand vendors' strong enterprise product shipments, according to Digitimes Research.</p>
      <p>Hewlett-Packard's (HP) shipments plunged 16% on month in October due to its business restructuring and layoff. Lenovo had an over 20% on-month decline in the month because of China's weak domestic demand, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/reports/">Digitimes Research</a>'s numbers show.</p>
      <p>Dell was the only top-5 brand enjoying an on-month growth in October as a result of its strong sales in North America's enterprise market. Dell also surpassed Lenovo to become the second largest brand in the month in terms of shipments.</p>
      <p>The top-3 notebook ODMs saw their combined shipments drop in a scale similar to that of the top-5 brands in October with Quanta Computer producing the best results as its orders from HP had the least decline compared to those of its competitors.</p>
