      <h3>DONTNOD has worked with GLAAD to ensure transgender male Tyler is "an authentic representation of the trans experience, as well as a genuine, multidimensional character."</h3>
      <p>The next game from <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/life-is-strange-2/"><i>Life is Strange</i>‘s</a> DONTNOD is <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/tell-me-why/"><i>Tell Me Why</i></a>, a narrative adventure featuring a transgender protagonist.</p>
      <p>Set in Alaska, <i>Tell Me Why</i> is a mystery involving twins Tyler and Alyson Ronan. According to Microsoft’s Joseph Staten, the twins will “use their extraordinary bond to unravel memories of a loving but troubled childhood.”</p>
      <p>“The core mechanic of the game is the special bond Tyler and Alyson cshare and it also a theme strongly anchored into the DONTNOD storytelling approach,” Florent Guillaume, Game Director, added. “Over the course of the story, players will explore the identical twins’ different memories of key events and choose which memory to believe. Ultimately, the choices players make determine the strength of the twins’ bond — and the future course of their lives.”</p>
      <p>DONTNOD has confirmed that Tyler identifies as a transgender man; the studio says it has worked closely with LGBTQ organisation GLAAD to shape Tyler “as an authentic representation of the trans experience, as well as a genuine, multidimensional character.”</p>
      <p>“Microsoft and DONTNOD have approached Tyler with a real commitment to authenticity,” GLAAD’s Nick Adams advised. “Tyler is a fully-realised, endearing character, whose story is not reduced to simplistic trans tropes.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/tell-me-why/"><i>Tell Me Why</i></a> will be released over three chapters, though all chapters will be made available in the Australian winter of 2020. The title will be offered on Windows PC, Xbox One — also available via <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass</a> — alongside Windows PC availabilty via Steam.</p>
