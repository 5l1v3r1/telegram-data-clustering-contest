      <p>In a game that wasn’t televised in South Africa, Bafana Bafana were beaten 2-0 in their opening 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier, and you can see the highlights here…</p>

      </p>
      <p>Molefi Ntseki’s side were confident going into the game for the head coach’s first competitive fixture since taking over from Stuart Baxter earlier in the year, but things didn’t go to plan as Thomas Partey and Mohammed Kudus scored one in each half to give them three points in Cape Coast on Thursday night. </p>
      <p>The defeat was the first time that Bafana have lost an AFCON qualifier since the defeat to Mauritania back in 2015, with the defeat bringing to an end a 10-game unbeaten run in qualifying games for Africa’s showpiece international tournament. </p>
      <p>A forced substitution for Bongani Zungu early in the game didn’t make things easier for Ntseki as he went up against his more experienced colleague, Kwesi Appiah, and things went from bad to worse when Partey opened the scoring not long afterwards.</p>

      <p>With Bafana chasing an equaliser, Kudus robbed Thamsanqa Mkhize before bearing down on Ronwen Williams’ goal and smashing into the corner to put the game to bed, and the South Africans now find themselves desperately needing three points on Sunday against Sudan. </p>
