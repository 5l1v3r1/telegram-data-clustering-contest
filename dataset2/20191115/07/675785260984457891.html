      <h2>Liz Gumbley, from Stone, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with MS in 1998 and had her PIP payments cut in 2015. She now receives £200 instead of the £230 she was paid before.</h2>

      <p>A grandmother with MS has claimed her benefits were cut because she was 'well dressed' and 'could lift her handbag'.</p>
      <p>Liz Gumbley, from Stone, Staffordshire, is now struggling to make ends meet after her payments were cut in 2015.</p>
      <p>She had received the higher rate of Disability Living Allowance [DLA] since her diagnosis in 1998 but lost it when she was reassessed for Personal Independence Payment [PIP] in 2015.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old says the benefits system is "broken".</p>
      <p>She said: "My assessor told me he was a physio and I don’t think he had a clue about MS.  I was assessed by somebody who doesn't know anything about the subject he's dealing with.</p>
      <p>"They didn't take into account the pain, depression and physical needs, they just go off what they can see on the day.</p>
      <p>"I suffer with hot flushes, pain and fatigue and will go for days on end without doing anything," she told <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/my-clean-tidy-appearance-counted-3532848">StokeonTrentLive.</a></p>

      <p>"He wrote in my report that I ‘picked up a medium-sized handbag and retrieved a purse’, which meant that I could chop vegetables and prepare food.</p>
      <p>"But my husband had told him I hadn’t cooked in five years because of my poor cognition and the risk of burning or cutting myself.</p>
      <p>“The assessor also wrote that I was well-nourished, well-dressed, clean and of good appearance – what has this got to do with my MS? I’m not going to go to an interview in my pyjamas!</p>
      <p>“When I had DLA it meant I could get people in to help me with things like the laundry and cleaning. These sound like luxuries but they are essentials that I can no longer do.</p>
      <p>"Now that my support has been cut it takes me three hours to clean my small en-suite bathroom and then I’m too fatigued to do anything else.</p>
      <p>"I’ve also had to cut back on exercise sessions, which helped me to manage my MS, and social activities, which has led to isolation and anxiety.</p>
      <p>"I used to go to physiotherapy weekly and to Thai Chai following advice from advice from my doctor and having to stop that is making my symptoms worse by not being able to afford the help that I need.</p>
      <p> "My energy levels suffer, I can't do things around the house and exercise helped me with socialising.</p>

      <p>"I've reduced my help in the home from every fortnight to once a month. I used to have help with my cleaning but instead now I have to sit in the mess knowing that I'm not capable of doing the cleaning or if I do clean up I then I suffer with the pain."</p>
      <p>The grandmother-of-two had to medically retire from her job as her teacher two years after she was diagnosed in 1998.</p>
      <p>Liz added: "The government has got to look at the benefits system because I don't feel they see the invisible symptoms. </p>
      <p>"When I was first assessed for DLA in 1998 I was more mobile and since then my disability has progressed but my benefits have been reduced. </p>
      <p>"I was shocked and it was upsetting when they reduced my benefits. I'm going without luxuries but there's people worse off than me who are unable to afford food or heating because of it. </p>
      <p>"PIP is not giving people independence. The rule under DLA used to be that if you would walk less than 50 metres you would be given a mobility benefit but under PIP that has also changed to 20 metres which isn't a long distance.</p>
      <p>"On a good day I may be able to walk 20 metres but people can have bad days where they can't, but we're judged on just one day at the consultation. </p>
      <p>"The government needs to work with the MS Society and MS Trust to discuss how the system can be altered.  The system is diabolical and a sham."</p>
      <p>She added: “Calling it Personal Independence Payment is ridiculous. They’re not helping you to be independent. If you go to your assessment showing you are ‘independent’, it goes against you.</p>
      <p>"But you are only independent because of the support you receive and because you’ve found your way of coping. It makes no sense and politicians need to take this issue seriously. The Government has to fix PIP.”</p>
      <p>Research from the MS Society found the condition can increase living costs by around £200 a week.</p>
      <p>Last year 83% of people with MS who appealed their PIP decision after moving from the old benefit won their case at tribunal – a success rate 12 per cent higher than the general overturn rate for PIP.</p>
      <p>Genevieve Edwards, director of external affairs at the MS Society, said: “The PIP process is failing people with MS at every stage, and cheating thousands out of vital support.</p>
      <p>"From tackling the complex form and proving how their disability affects them, to challenging an incorrect decision, people tell us it’s humiliating and degrading to spend months fighting for PIP.</p>
      <p>"This is made even harder when dealing with assessors who don’t properly understand MS, which is relentless, painful and disabling.</p>
      <p>“Ahead of the coming election, we want politicians to recognise that people with MS deserve a welfare system they can trust.</p>
      <p>"Decisions should be backed up by evidence not assumptions, and assessors need to have good knowledge of the condition. We hope people will get behind this, sign our open letter, and make sure the next UK Government commits to improving PIP, once and for all.”</p>
      <p>Liz is supporting a new campaign by the MS Society.</p>
      <p>The charity is encouraging people to sign an open letter to next UK Government, calling on it to make common sense changes to the PIP assessment process. See more at   <a href="http://mssociety.org.uk/PIP-letter">mssociety.org.uk/PIP-letter</a></p>
      <p>A DWP spokesperson said: <b/> “Ms Gumbley continues to receive PIP including the highest rate for the mobility element. Our assessors, who are medical professionals, receive specialist training on a full range of conditions including MS.</p>
      <p>“A range of support, including home visits, is available to help claimants complete an application for PIP and our independent survey shows that fewer than one in 10 PIP claimants stated they were unable to do so.”</p>
