      <p><i>Final Fantasy VII</i> through <i>XV</i> (excluding the MMOs)will get added to Game Pass in the coming months, Microsoft announced today during the latest episode of Inside Xbox at this year’s XO19 fan event in London.</p>
      <p>That chunk of the series includes nine games, many of which, like <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> and <i>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</i>, were made even better with excellent new remasters. It also includes the<i> Final Fantasy XIII</i> trilogy, which despite arguably being a low point for the series overall, still includes some damn fine JRPGS. <i>XIII-2</i> and <i>Lightning Returns</i> are still both totally worth playing in my opinion.</p>
