      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Two rideshare companies are urging Ohio to resume requiring front license plates.</p>
      <p>Uber and Lyft submitted letters Thursday to Republican Senate President Larry Obhof (AWB'-hawf) in support of legislation that would again make it mandatory for Ohio drivers to affix license plates to both the front and back of their vehicles.</p>
      <p>The companies cite safety concerns. Both urge their riders to confirm the license plate number on a phone app before entering a rideshare vehicle. A 21-year-old University of South Carolina student was murdered earlier this year by the driver of a car she mistakenly thought was an Uber vehicle.</p>
      <p>A provision removing Ohio's front plate requirement was included in the state transportation budget passed earlier this year. It is set to take effect in July.</p>
