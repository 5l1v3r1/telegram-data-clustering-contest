      </p>
      <p>The hosts made 302-6 before declaring, with Glenn Phillips - who was dropped by Dom Sibley on 27 - scoring 116.</p>
      <p>England captain Joe Root walked gingerly off the field after diving to stop a boundary but returned once he had been assessed by England's staff.</p>
      <p>The tourists lost Rory Burns for 14 en route to 26-1 at the close.</p>
      <p>"The wicket has been seriously flat, which was surprising," said Stokes. "But that's a great test for us as a bowling group.</p>
      <p>"It was a great opportunity for us to try a few different things and just try to figure out, if we do get a pitch like this in the Test series, what works well and what doesn't."</p>
      <p>Of Root's injury, he added: "At one point, we were discussing whether he had hurt his knee, ankle or hamstring. Thankfully, it was none of those.</p>
      <p>"He just took a bump on his leg from stopping the ball and sort of got a dead leg but it was good to see him running back on the field."</p>
      <p>England play two Tests against New Zealand, with the first starting in Mount Maunganui on 20 November.</p>
