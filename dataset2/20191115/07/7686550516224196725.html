      <h1>Child hospitalised following Cardiff school's unusual toilet policy</h1>
      <h2>A four-year-old Cardiff girl spent three days in hospital with constipation after she became anxious about paying a visit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:51:57+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:51</time> by <a rel="author">Abbie Wightwick, Paul Smith</a></address>
      <p>An outraged mum has forced a Cardiff school into a change of policy after her young daughter was hospitalised with constipation.</p>
      <p>Instead of supplying toilet paper in every cubicle, Kitchener Road Primary forced children aged between four and 11 to use a dispenser in a public area prior to paying a visit.</p>
      <p>If they fail to estimate the amount required correctly, children were then required to go back outside and collect more.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, mother Fahmin Khanum told Wales Online that some children soiled themselves while others became too anxious to relieve themselves when nature called.</p>
      <p>Fahmin's four-year-old daughter was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales for three days last month with agonising stomach pains which medics eventually diagnosed as constipation, something the child had not suffered from before.</p>
      <p>“She was not clearing her bowels properly in school because of the toilet paper policy. It was a traumatic experience,” said human resources manager Fahmin, 32.</p>
      <p>“My daughter is quite independent from going to day nurseries before starting school in September and she was potty trained at two-and-half and had not had problems before.”</p>

      <p>It was only when Fahmin went into the school in Canton for parents' evening that she discovered the cause of the problem.</p>
      <p>The four year-old, who is in the reception class, was so worried about not taking enough paper into the cubicle that she was not relieving herself when she needed to.</p>
      <p>“At parents’ evening I went to the toilet and there was a single tissue dispenser and my daughter counted out five sheets.</p>
      <p>"There are no tissue dispensers in the cubicles, which the head teacher told me was to prevent children blocking them through using too much toilet paper.</p>
      <p>“My daughter was not clearing her bowels properly in school because of the toilet paper policy and that caused her to end up in hospital."</p>
      <p>Fahmin said her daughter was getting anxious using the toilet at home and school as a result and has soiled herself at least once at school because she didn’t take enough paper first time.</p>
      <p>“Last Monday when I went to collect my daughter the teacher told me she had soiled herself.</p>
      <p>“This is not just about my daughter, it’s about all the children. It’s a health-and-safety issue impacting on children’s welfare and it’s awful for the children’s dignity.”</p>
      <p>Fahmin, a human resources advisor at Cartrefi Cymru Co-operative, which works with people with learning difficulties, and her husband Afjul Ali, wrote a formal letter of complaint to the school's head teacher Ruth Jackson.</p>
      <p>Following her complaint the school reviewed its policy.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman from the school said: “We will soon be installing dispensers in all our cubicles. We will be contacting parents shortly to let them know of the change.”</p>
