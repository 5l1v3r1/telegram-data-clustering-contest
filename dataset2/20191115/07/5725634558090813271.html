      <h1>Sentiment Stays The Same</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:42:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Bespoke Investment Group</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Per AAII's weekly survey, bullish sentiment rose just 0.42 percentage points to 40.72% from 40.30% last week.</li>
        <li>The percentage of investors reporting as pessimistic rose 0.89 percentage points to 24.82%.</li>
        <li>Neutral sentiment moved the most this week falling 1.31 percentage points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite a couple closes at all-time highs in the past week, the S&amp;P 500 is currently right around the same levels as last Wednesday's close. With little in the way of price changes, sentiment has likewise seen little change. Per <a href="https://www.aaii.com/sentimentsurvey">AAII's weekly survey</a>, bullish sentiment rose just 0.42 percentage points to 40.72% from 40.30% last week. That small increase is in the bottom 5% of all week-over-week changes in bullish sentiment in the history of the data.</p>
      <p>While little changed, the bulk of investors are still optimistic. Another sentiment survey from <i>Investors Intelligence</i> also echoed these results. In that survey released yesterday, 57.6% reported as bullish. While that is the highest reading since July, it is up only around half of one percent from last week.</p>

      <p>Bearish sentiment was also little changed. The percentage of investors reporting as pessimistic rose 0.89 percentage points to 24.82%. Like bullish sentiment, the one-week change in bearish sentiment was small relative to history with this week's change sitting in the 7<sup>th</sup> percentile of all readings. This week also marked the fourth in a row that bearish sentiment has been below its historical average. That is the longest such streak since a seven-week run from the end of March to early May of this year.</p>

      <p>Neutral sentiment moved the most this week falling 1.31 percentage points. Now at 34.46%, neutral sentiment is the lowest since early September and back in the middle of the past few years' range.</p>
