      <h1>Boss blasts Gartcairn drop-outs stating he would never have missed a game</h1>
      <h2>Raging Jamie McKenzie was spoke out after just 13 players were available for last weekends cup exit against Kilsyth.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p>Boss Jamie McKenzie has called for his players to show they are committed to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gartcairn-boss-aims-more-junior-20750627">Gartcairn</a> cause this weekend against Cambuslang Rangers.</p>
      <p>The gaffer reckons there is a generational gap between the current crop of players and when he was on the park following the West of Scotland Cup exit against Greenock.</p>
      <p>“The players have been told in no uncertain terms that we have got to be better.” he told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/gartcairn-boss-aims-more-junior-20750627">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser.</a></p>
      <p>“Just now it looks like it hurts me more than it hurts them – that isn’t the way this should be.</p>
      <p>“Last weekend there was a lot of reasons players dropped out of the game, but I would say that when I was playing I would never have missed a game.</p>

      <p>“In this day and age it’s different but when I was playing you would build your week around the game.</p>
      <p>“I’ve spoken to a few managers and players from my generation and they are having the same problem.</p>
      <p>“They don’t seem to have the same desire that my generation had.”</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s a massive game now against Cambuslang. If we lose a gap starts to form at the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>“My players need to cut out the mistakes.”</p>
