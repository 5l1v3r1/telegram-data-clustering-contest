      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino 'fuming' at Tottenham's failure to complete Philippe Coutinho transfer</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino does not know whether he will be given the time to rebuild Tottenham after another disappointing Premier League result</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:54:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is livid with Tottenham after they failed to sign Philippe Coutinho this summer.</p>
      <p>Spurs boss Pochettino worked with the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> star at Espanyol and was keen to bring him back to the Premier League in the summer.</p>
      <p>However the Brazilian opted to leave <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> for a loan switch to Germany with Bayern Munich, where he has impressed.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10348530/pochettino-spurs-coutinho-transfer-miss-barcelona-bayern-munich/">The Sun</a> , Pochettino made clear his feelings to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>The Argentine is desperate to bolster his ranks and has previously urged the club to break the bank to bring new players to north London.</p>

      <p>Pochettino, meanwhile, does not know whether he will be given the time to rebuild <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> after another disappointing Premier League result.</p>
      <p>Spurs' horrible start to the season continued as they were again sub-standard in stuttering to a 1-1 draw against Sheffield United, leaving them with just three wins from their opening 12 league games.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has spoken at length about how the club were entering a "painful rebuild" after their run to the Champions League final last term, but no one envisaged just how painful things would be on the pitch as well as off it.</p>
      <p>They led at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium through Son Heung-min, but George Baldock's 78th-minute leveller earned the Blades, who also had a goal marginally ruled out by VAR, a deserved point.</p>

      <p>Pochettino said as recently as Tuesday that he would like to see out the remaining three years of his contract, but now has hinted he might not be given that much time as the pressure increases.</p>
      <p>"I think you can see that yes, we need to find the balance," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are building a team during the season, while competing in the Champions League and Premier League, the toughest league in the world, and always that is dangerous, this type of situation can happen.</p>
      <p>"You expect better results than you get. Of course we are in a process to build and we'll see if we have time to build what we want."</p>
