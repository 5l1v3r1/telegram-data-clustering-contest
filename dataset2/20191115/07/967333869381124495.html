        <b>Washington and Seoul agreed to discuss sharing the cost to maintain 28,500 US troops earlier this year, as the Americans allegedly wanted to request their ally pay almost $5 billion under a renewed cost-sharing deal in 2020, a fivefold increase of the 2018 payment.</b>

      <p>During a Friday meeting with South Korean Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper stated that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911151077311192-crucial-that-south-korea-increases-burden-sharing-for-us-military---defence-secretary-esper/Esper%20also%20noted%20that%20both%20allies%20have%20to%20remain%20flexible%20with%20their%20plans%20on%20joint%20military%20exercises%20in%20order%20to%20support%20their%20diplomatic%20efforts%20with%20North%20Korea.">Seoul should increase its burden sharing</a> for the American forces stationed in the country, stressing the deal that is now being negotiated, should be fair and mutually agreeable.</p>
      <p>According to him, the bonds between the two nations are very strong, but South Korea is a wealthy country and should increase its defence spending.</p>

      <p>â€‹Esper also noted that both allies have to remain flexible with their plans on joint military exercises in order to support their diplomatic efforts with North Korea.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911071077242237-washington-wants-seoul-to-pay-47bln-for-us-forces-stationed-in-south-korea---reports/">South Korea previously agreed to increase its contribution to the United States Forces Korea</a> (USFK) to $923 million in 2019, up from the $830 million Seoul provided in 2018.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump, who has been urging American allies across the world to contribute more money to their own defence, thereby easing pressure on Washington, wanted Seoul to spend $4.7 billion next year to cover the cost of servicemen in the peninsula.</p>
