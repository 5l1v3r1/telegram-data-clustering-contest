      <p>Acting U.S. Ambassador William Taylor tied President Trump directly to the campaign to bribe Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in Wednesday's public impeachment hearings, and that testimony led to a <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878490/2nd-official-reportedly-overheard-trumps-phone-call-sondland-about-investigations">second "bombshell" Thursday</a>, news of a second witness to Trump's <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878352/former-officials-stunned-by-sondland-calling-trump-from-middle-restaurant-kyiv">overheard phone call</a>, Stephen Colbert said on Thursday's <i>Late Show</i>. "So Taylor's testimony was historic — unless you ask Kellyanne Conway, who was not entertained," telling Fox News the hearings were a snoozefest starring "a bunch of gossip girls." Colbert was confused: "Well, is it boring or is it <i>Gossip Girl</i>? Because it can't be both! <i>Gossip Girl</i> was a very successful show."</p>
      <p>"But it wasn't just Kellyanne," Colbert said. "Even NBC News tweeted the testimony 'lacked the pizzazz necessary to capture public attention.'"</p>

      <p>"What do you mean, it lacked pizzazz?" asked Seth Meyers on <i>Late Night</i>. "The only politicians who have ever been entertaining were the ones in <i>Hamilton</i>. What do you want them to do, show up with their own backup dancers?" Ironically, he added, "Trump's defenders in the Republican Party and on Fox News" were the most invested in working "to dismiss the entire thing as a fake scandal invented by Democrats for TV."</p>

      <p>"There are a lot of hot takes out there right now — one of the dumbest is that these impeachment hearings aren't interesting enough," Jimmy Kimmel said on <i>Kimmel Live</i>. "These were two career civil servants giving sworn testimony about a potential attempt to undermine our democracy — they're also supposed to have 'pizzazz'?" Amazingly, he said, that actually "seems to be an emerging line of defense for Republicans," who very clearly "don't want to talk about the facts."</p>

      <p>"Even though millions of people have been talking about these hearings," Fox News seems determined to get people to tune out, Trevor Noah said at <i>The Daily Show</i>. Their main argument is that "Americans are too dumb to follow these impeachment proceedings," but "sometimes if you watch Fox, it looks like they're straight-up trying to hypnotize their viewers into not caring," he added. If those fail, "Fox has come up with another reason to ignore the impeachment hearings": They're "boring and unsexy."</p>
      <p>"These hearings are investigating whether the president of the United States committed high crimes or misdemeanors," Noah said. "They're supposed to be serious, not about excitement. Impeachment is like a family reunion: If it's sexy, something has gone horribly wrong." Peter Weber</p>
