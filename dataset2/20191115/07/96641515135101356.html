      <p>Ford's 'Mustang-inspired' electric crossover will be unveiled Sunday night, but you can find out a lot about the Mach-E right now. That's because a forum poster dug up an informational page on Ford's website that revealed trim levels, pricing, pictures and some specs for the SUV. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/14/ford-mustang-mach-e/">These shots clearly show the two-door crossover in red</a>, which is one of three exterior color options available for its limited edition model. While its Mustang inspiration seems mostly limited to the headlights and taillights, it's at least fairly sleek and imbued with the kind of performance angle Ford is clearly pursuing.</p>
      <p>A base Select model starts at about $43k before jumping to Premium, then California Route 1, then the $59,900 limited First Edition and finally the top-of-the-line GT model,which costs about $60k. The base model has around 230 miles of EPA-estimated range, which goes up to 300 miles with an extended battery, while the sporty GT model has AWD, 235 miles of range and an expected 0 to 60 MPH time in the mid 3-second range.</p>

      <p>Tesla's Model S was added to and removed from CR's recommended list more than once in the past. It got booted from the list last year due to issues with its air suspension system, while for the Model 3 issues included braking, body trim and glass defects. Despite that, the cheaper electric sedan is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/tesla-model-3-s-consumer-reports-recommended-list/">now listed as the fifth most reliable car out of 12 luxury vehicles</a>.</p>
