      <p>Lei Jun: All Xiaomi phones above 2000 yuan ($285) will support 5G<br/>1.5 (30%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>At the 2019 China Mobile Global Partner Conference, Xiaomi’s CEO, Lei Jun, said that the company will fully promote the development and promotion of 5G mobile phones. According to Lei Jun, in the first half of 2020, all <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> smartphones with a price tag above 2000 yuan ($285) will be 5G phones. Recall that he earlier said that the company will release 10 5G phones next year. This means that with luck, we could be buying 5G phones for less than $300 next year.</p>

      <p>Xiaomi has previously launched the 5G+AIoT strategy. In addition to 5G mobile phones, it will also vigorously develop AIOT devices. Lei Jun said that Xiaomi’s IoT platform has connected 196 million devices, and the number of users of IoT devices exceeds 3 million. Recently, MediaTek announced that it will hold a new product launch conference on November 26, officially releasing a new 5G chip. In addition, there is news that the first model of MediaTek’s 5G chip is likely to be the Redmi K30. This mobile phone will have a good chance to meet us at the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Lei Jun had previously said that Xiaomi’s attitude toward 5G is optimistic and radical. In the early days of 5G popularization, high-definition video applications and cloud games have the possibility of breaking out.</p>
