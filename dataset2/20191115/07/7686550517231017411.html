      <h1>McDonald's to change breakfast serving hours across the UK</h1>
      <h2>It also means changes to the times you can order your breakfast delivered</h2>

      <p>McDonald's has announced it is to change its breakfast hours across the UK after a recent trial - and it's great news for hash brown and McMuffin fans.</p>
      <p>Every branch of McDonald's is to add an extra 30 minutes to its breakfast serving times - meaning you will be able to get your hands on Breakfast Wraps and pancakes until 11am.</p>
      <p>The new rules come into force across the country next week after a successful trial in a handful of restaurants earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The changes will take place on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>The test hours were tried out in 122 restaurants in the south of England.</p>
      <p>The changes also mean if you're a fan of Big Macs - or anything else on the main menu - you will have to wait another 30 minutes before they go on sale every day.</p>
      <p>Michelle Graham-Clare, Vice President Food &amp; Marketing at McDonald’s UK and Ireland said: "We all understand the pain of missing out on a McMuffin by a matter of minutes.</p>
      <p>"We have listened to our customers’ pleas and are delighted to extend breakfast serving time until 11am, particularly as we head into the festive season when we see a rush of latecomers searching for those all-important hash browns.</p>
      <p>If you like ordering your breakfast through Uber Eats, the changes mean the cut-off time will now be 10.45am instead of 10.15am.</p>
