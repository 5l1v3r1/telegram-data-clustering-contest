      <h1>Alfredo Morelos transfer warning issued by Rangers star's agent as he tells clubs to act soon</h1>
      <h2>The Colombian striker has been on fire this season and has been heavily linked with a move away from Glasgow.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:44:57+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Premier League clubs who are interested in signing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> have been told to act now or spend even more money to get him.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star has been heavily linked with moves to the likes of Aston Villa and Crystal Palace and one of his representatives has fired a warning to suitors ahead of the January window.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has scored 22 goals already this season and continues to impress for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard's</a> men as they battle with Celtic at the top of the Premiership.</p>
      <p>Theofilos Karasavvidis works for World in Motion - who represent Morelos - and claims Rangers don't have a huge fee placed on his head.</p>
      <p>Gerrard and Rangers sporting director Ross Wilson both insist Morelos isn't going anywhere in the January window but Karasavvidis believes clubs need to make a move for him soon.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/tmw-wyscout-ag-lykogiannis-resta-a-gennaio-decide-il-cagliari-1314595">Tuttomercatoweb:</a> "He is a player who has always scored a lot since he arrived in Europe.</p>
      <p>"This is a goal machine. He is a player worth following, (the clubs) who want a striker must come and follow him.</p>
      <p>“He does not have a very high value. My advice is to take him before his name is on everyone's lips."</p>
      <p>Morelos has 70 goals in 116 appearances for Rangers since moving to the club in 2017 from HJK.</p>
      <p>Previous bids of around £10million from Chinese Super League clubs had been rejected and Morelos has often spoken of his wish to play in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">English Premier League.</a></p>
      <p>There's yet to be any concrete offers for him but his current form mixed with his improved disciplinary record has attracted admiring glances from around Europe.</p>
      <p>He's currently in the USA with Colombia as he prepares for two friendlies against Peru and Ecuador.</p>
