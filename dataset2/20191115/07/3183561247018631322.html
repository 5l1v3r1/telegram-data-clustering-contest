      <p>Speaking of Batman, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/jennifer-lopez-robert-pattinson-batman-hustlers-the-lighthouse-1203402753/">Variety</a> posted another <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/chris-evans-says-it-would-be-a-shame-to-sour-captain-americas-mcu-ending-by-bringing-steve-back">Actors on Actors</a> piece yesterday pairing Robert Pattinson and Jennifer Lopez and they very briefly touched upon the Caped Crusador:</p>
      <blockquote>Lopez: Why “Batman”? <br/><br/>Pattinson: With “Batman,” there was something — I was very focused on it. It kept coming back into my head. <br/><br/>Lopez: So you sought out the part?<br/><br/>Pattinson: Well, not sought it out directly. But I was interested in it. I don’t know what it is, which happened inside of me, but I was like, “I kind of want to do it.” I like doing something which an audience doesn’t know that it wants, and try to get it out of them: “Oh yeah, you want to play Batman.” <br/><br/>Lopez: You’re going to be Batman.<br/><br/>Pattinson: And that’s crazy! Let me tell you something. Whenever I see that little action figure, I still haven’t really got my head around it yet. </blockquote>

      <h3>Mayday</h3>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/juliette-lewis-grace-van-patten-mia-goth-mayday-karen-cinorre-1202783931/">Deadline</a> reports Juliette Lewis, Grace Van Patten, and Mia Goth are now attached to star in Karen Cinorre’s directorial debut, <i>Mayday</i>, “a fantastical female-driven action film” focusing on “a young woman named Ana (Van Patten) who is transported to a dreamlike and dangerous land where she joins up with a band of female soldiers engaged in a never-ending war along a rugged coast.”</p>

      <h3>Clive Barker’s Books of Blood</h3>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/books-of-blood-andy-mcqueen-freda-foh-shen-nicholas-campbell-join-hulu-movie-1202781770/">Deadline</a> also reports Andy McQueen, Freda Foh Shen and Nicholas Campbell (<i>Da Vinci’s Inquest</i>/<i>Da Vinci’s City Hall</i>) have joined the cast of Hulu’s upcoming <i>Books of Blood</i> movie from director Brannon Braga and producer Seth McFarlane.

      <h3>The Mandalorian</h3>
      <p>An oddly soundless behind-the-scenes video featuring George Lucas visiting the set of the Disney+ series has surfaced.</p>

      <p>In other intriguing tidbits, in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/disney-chief-scorsese-marvel-mandalorian-1203403513/">Variety</a>, Disney chief Alan Horn was asked about doing the reverse of bringing the Marvel movie characters to Disney+ and perhaps making a movie jump from the small screen instead (something <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/youre-damn-right-ms-marvel-she-hulk-and-moon-knight-will-be-in-the-mcu-movies-too">previously covered by Kevin Feige</a>).</p>
      <blockquote>In response, Horn revealed that a feature based on Disney Plus’ tentpole original series and “Star Wars” spinoff “The Mandalorian,” for instance, might not be out of the question.<br/><br/>“‘The Mandalorian’ is already proving to be a big thing, so if that series proves to be so compelling that we reverse engineer it into a theatrical release, a two-hour film or whatever, O.K.,” Horn said.</blockquote>

      <h3>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</h3>
      <p>Speaking of George, in a recent interview with Total Film (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-jj-abrams-george-lucas-midichlorians/">Games Radar</a>), J.J. Abrams revealed he held a meeting with Lucas to discuss the nature of midi-chlorians, the controversial Force-sensitive microbes introduced in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>Yes, there were some conversations about Midi-chlorians - he loves his Midi-chlorians. But it was a very helpful thing. Sitting with him is a treat, just to hear him talk, because it’s fucking George Lucas talking about Star Wars. I always feel it’s a gift to hear him talk about that stuff. Because the effect that he had on me at 10 years old is utterly profound.</blockquote>

      <h3>Marvel vs. DC</h3>
      <p>Anthony and Joe Russo (aka the Russo Brothers) have set up a documentary series to executive produce next for Quibi. <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/russo-brothers-to-produce-slugfest-marvel-vs-dc-documentary-series-for-quibi-1202784863/">Deadline</a> reports, “The series is inspired by Reed Tucker’s book <i>Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle Between Marvel and DC.</i> The competition between the publishers actually dates back to the FDR years and the publication of <i>Action Comics</i> No. 1 (which introduced Superman and launched DC) and <i>Marvel Comics</i> No. 1 (which introduced Namor the Sub-Mariner), but it was the revolutionary 1960s relaunch of Marvel by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko that gave the rivalry an urgency that transformed the marketplace.”</p>
