      <p>Prince Charles and wife Camilla arrived for a short visit to India just in time for his 71st birthday. According to the latest report, the royals will spend time indulging themselves in a luxury health rejuvenation experience in India before they head for their tour in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111480593/duchess-of-cornwall-prince-charles-71st-birthday-gift/">Hello</a>, the Duchess of Cornwall joined her husband for a wellness retreat at a holistic health centre after his two days of public engagements in the Indian cities of New Delhi and Mumbai. The royal couple reunited for their short holiday in Bangalore at a wellness resort that specialises in yogic, ayurvedic, homeopathic and naturopathic treatments. The place is located amidst nature in a 30-acre organic farm.</p>
      <p>The short sojourn was reportedly planned on Camilla's request. "The Duchess has been determined to force the Prince to have some downtime on his birthday and insisted he join her at her retreat," a royal source told the publication.</p>
      <p>Camilla is no stranger to traditional Indian wellness approaches, and this is not the first time she is visiting the place. It is said that the member of the British royal family has previously visited the healing centre five times.</p>
      <p>Previously, it was reported that the couple will not be able to spend time together on the prince's special day. However, the two found time for a romantic getaway before they head to New Zealand on Sunday, November 17.</p>

He interacted with Indian environmentalist Sunita Narain and later paid a visit to a Sikh temple Gurudwara Bangla Sahib.
