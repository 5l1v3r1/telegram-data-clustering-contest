      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:55:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>on Friday said a Shiv Sena-NCP-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress </a>government will be formed and it will complete five-year term as he ruled out the possibility of mid-term polls in Maharashtra which is currently under Presidents rule.</p>
      <p>He said the three parties want to form a stable government which will be development-oriented.</p>
      <p>There is no possibility of mid-term polls. This government will be formed and it will complete five years. We all will ensure this government runs for five years, Pawar told reporters here.</p>
      <p>Asked whether the BJP was holding discussion with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>over government formation in the state, the former Union minister said his party was holding talks with only the Sena, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress </a>and its allies and nobody beyond these.</p>
      <p>He said the three parties are at present working out a common minimum programme (CMP) that will guide the actions of the government being planned in the state.</p>
      <p>Representatives of the three parties met in Mumbai on Thursday and prepared a draft CMP.</p>
      <p>Pawar took a dig at former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis remark that the Shiv Sena-NCP-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/congress">Congress </a>government will not survive for more than six months.</p>
      <p>I know Devendra ji for some years. But I did not know he is a student of astrology too, Pawar quipped.</p>
      <p>Pawar took a jibe at Fadnavis over his mi punha yein (I will come again) remark.</p>
      <p>It is alright he said it. I was thinking something else all the while: I will come again, I will come again, I will come again. Now, you (the reporter) is giving some other information, he added.</p>
