      <h1>Prince Andrew to appear in 'no holds barred' TV interview on Jeffrey Epstein scandal</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew sat down with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis to face questions for the first time about his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:45:43+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew</a> has faced questions for the first time in a "world exclusive" interview about his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York sat down with BBC Newsnight journalist Emily Maitlis amid claims that he had sex with one of the disgraced financier's accusers when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis has called it a "no holds barred interview" and claims no questions were vetted by the Queen's son or his staff in advance, but so far the BBC has not revealed what he said.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis interviewed the 59-year-old senior royal at Buckingham Palace on Thursday for a programme - dubbed "Prince Andrew &amp; the Epstein Scandal" - that is due to be shown on BBC Two on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Until now, Andrew - who has strongly denied claims that he had sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre (nee Roberts) when she was 17 - had only released prepared statements through Buckingham Palace's press office.</p>

      <p>Ms Maitlis tweeted: "Saturday 9pm. BBC2. No holds barred interview - no questions vetted- with Prince Andrew."</p>
      <p>Newsnight wrote: "WORLD EXCLUSIVE: In a #Newsnight @BBCTwo interview recorded yesterday at Buckingham Palace, Emily Maitlis talks to Prince Andrew about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein - the first time he’s answered questions on the scandal."</p>
      <p>Questions about the duke's relationship with Epstein resurfaced after the financier was recently accused of child sex trafficking offences in the US. Epstein was in custody on those charges when he died aged 66 earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Andrew had been photographed with Epstein in Central Park and at the door of his Manhattan mansion in the past.</p>

      <p>They were pictured together after Epstein was sentenced to 18 months in jail in Florida after admitting a charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18.</p>
      <p>The duke has said he did not "see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction".</p>
      <p>He was also pictured with his arm around Mrs Giuffre in London in 2001, when she was 17. She claims she was coerced into having sex with the royal on three occasions - in London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>In a TV interview in September, she claimed Andrew was “an abuser, a participant” in Epstein's exploitation of her.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre claims she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with his rich and famous friends.</p>

      <p>Recently, a special edition of Channel 4's Dispatches re-examined court papers which also claim Epstein and Andrew had an orgy with Mrs Giuffre and eight other girls.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre's allegations about the duke were struck from the US court record in 2015 - when they were filed in a civil suit against Epstein - after a judge branded them “immaterial and impertinent”.</p>
      <p>The documentary, which will air on Monday night, also looked at Mrs Giuffre's medical records from around the time she claims she was abused.</p>
      <p>In evidence to a Florida court four years ago, Mrs Giuffre wrote: "The third time I had sex with Andy was in an orgy on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. I was around 18 at the time.</p>
      <p>"Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together.</p>
      <p>"The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English.</p>
      <p>"Epstein laughed about the fact they couldn't really communicate, saying that they are the 'easiest' girls to get along with."</p>
      <p>The documentary claimed Andrew met Epstein at least 10 times during a 12-year friendship and had stayed with him for several days on occasions.</p>
      <p>Mike Fisten, a former detective who has investigated the case, claims Epstein had 13 phone numbers for the Duke of York in an address book found at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
      <p>In a separate case, Johanna Sjoberg alleged that Andrew touched her breast while they were on a sofa in Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2001.</p>

      <p>The allegations - strongly denied by the duke - were included in documents from a defamation case.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell introduced Prince Andrew and Epstein, her one-time boyfriend in the 1990s, to each other.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert, has strongly denied claims she recruited and groomed girls to be sexually abused by Epstein and others. The 57-year-old has not been charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>Andrew said in a previous statement: "At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction."</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace said previously: "Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue."</p>
      <p>It added: "It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation."</p>

      <p>A US Federal Appeals Court has warned that allegations in court papers should not be understood as firm findings or as "some sort of marker of reliability" because New York law grants absolute immunity from liability for defamation.</p>
      <p>Epstein died after he was found unresponsive in his New York jail cell on August 10 while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>His death was ruled a suicide and it came two days after he signed a will and put his estimated $577million (£448million) estate into a trust.</p>
      <p>Following his July 6 arrest, Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges involving dozens of underage girls at his mansions on Manhattan's Upper East Side and in Palm Beach, Florida, over several years.</p>
      <p>He had escaped federal prosecution by pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state prostitution charges, an agreement now widely considered too lenient.</p>
      <p>The executors of Epstein's estate have asked a judge to approve the creation of a proposed fund to compensate women the financier was accused of having sexually abused.</p>
      <p>The executors, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, said in a statement that the fund would create a "voluntary, confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation."</p>
      <p>His estate is facing about a dozen lawsuits from women who say Epstein sexually abused them, many while they were underage.</p>
