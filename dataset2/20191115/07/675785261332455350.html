      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:17:17+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:17</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Abigail O'Leary, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>An SAS trooper who shot dead two terrorists in a hotel siege in January is to receive a top bravery medal.</p>
      <p>The soldier, who stalked the corridors on a heroic lone mission inside a Kenya hotel, will be honoured with the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross — second only to a Victoria Cross.</p>
      <p>During the 19-hour siege at the DusitD2 hotel complex in Nairobi, the trooper is said to only have entered the battle after US Navy SEALs asked for his help.</p>
      <p>He went on to kill two out of four gunmen, leading to the evacuation of 700 locals.</p>
      <p>Sources reportedly confirmed the brave soldier, who has served for 18 years, has been informed of his award and he will receive it from the Queen later this month.</p>

      <p>The medal is awarded for “acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy” - with only around 60 such honours being awarded.</p>
      <p>A senior insider told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10349851/kenya-hotel-sas-top-medal/">The Sun</a> : “This is an incredible honour and truly deserved.</p>
      <p>"What this man did will go down in the history of the SAS."</p>
      <p>The elite soldier was training up Kenya's army when the attack took place.</p>

      <p>He reportedly received permission from the UK High Commissioner to take on the terrorists.</p>
      <p>Within minutes of getting the green light it is said he shot dead the first gunman.</p>

      <p>He then killed a second man before Kenyan forces surrounded the other two, who were also killed after a stand-off.</p>
