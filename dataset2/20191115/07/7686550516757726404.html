      <p>Peanut allergy sufferers have received a boost with the news that a new potentially life-saving injection is in the final stages of development.</p>
      <p>The new antibody, which is called etokimab, lasts for up to six weeks and enables people with severe peanut allergies to eat a nut's worth of peanut protein just two weeks later.</p>
      <p>A small pilot study published in the journal JCI Insight provided early evidence that the antibody is a safe, effective and rapid treatment.</p>
      <p>The only existing treatment requires patients to eat tiny, gradually escalating doses of their food-allergy trigger under medical supervision takes six months to a year, and can cause allergic reactions along the way.</p>
      <p>By contrast, 73 per cent of the people who received the new antibody, all of whom had severe peanut allergies, could tolerate a modest amount of peanut protein just 15 days after a single injection.</p>
      <p>Study senior author Professor Kari Nadeau, of Stanford University, said: "What's great about this treatment as an option for food allergies is that people did not have to eat the food to get desensitised."</p>
      <p>"Although this is still in the experimental stages, we're delivering on the hope of testing a drug that won't be for one food allergy but for many, and for other allergic diseases, too."</p>
      <p>She noted that etokimab has already been tested in people with other immune diseases, including asthma and eczema.</p>
      <p>In the study, 15 adults with severe peanut allergies received a single injection of etokimab, while five others, who also had severe peanut allergies, received a placebo.</p>
      <p>Fifteen days later, participants tried eating a small amount of peanut protein under medical supervision.</p>
      <p>In the etokimab group, 11 of 15 people could eat 275mg of peanut protein - one nut's worth - without an allergic reaction; but no placebo recipients could do so.</p>
      <p>Prof Nadeau added: "We were surprised how long the effects of the treatment lasted."</p>
      <p>She confirmed that none of the participants in the trial reported severe side effects.Now the research team plans to repeat the study with more participants and look for biomarkers that identify which patients could benefit from the antibody treatment.</p>
