        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 15 – The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock has announced a raft of measures aimed at reversing the dwindling fish stocks in Lake Victoria.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri Thursday projected to turn around the fishing sector in the lake region within three years to address the reduction in annual fish harvests.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Kiunjuri said the plan is to raise fish production in the lake annually to 200,000 metric tonnes by the year 2022 as part of the revival scheme.</p>
      <p>“My ministry intends to revive fisheries in this region and subsequently raise production,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mwangi in the last five years, the lake has continued to decline in fish production that now stands at 90,000 metric tonnes annually from 140,000 metric tonnes annually.</p>
      <p>“Lake Victoria fisher has experienced a worrying decline in fish stocks and diversity and subsequent fall in fish catches,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kiunjuri who spoke as he officially opened a two-day conference on Blue Economy in Kisumu said the decline has posed several threats with long term effects on development of the country.</p>
      <p>He said food security, fish export and fish industries following the collapse of fish procession factories have suffered as a result of the decline occasioned by several factors.</p>
      <p>“The declining fish stocks in Lake Victoria is attributed to unsustainable fishing practices, that is overfishing and use of illegal gears,” the CS said.</p>
      <p>Kiunjuri said his ministry has now developed a framework that will see the revival of the lake for the government to optimize on its blue economy opportunities.</p>
      <p>He said the framework will address most of the challenges that has led to its dwindling stock as the ministry moves to restore the sector’s lost glory.</p>
      <p>“We must therefore address these issues if we have to get the full benefit of this water resource,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kiunjuri said there will be a strong enforcement in the lake to curb the menace of illegal fishing currently being witnessed in the lake.</p>
      <p>He announced that plans are underway to develop six fish landing beaches in the counties of Busia, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Migori.</p>
      <p>“We intend to also develop more sites to improve handling of fish to reduce post-harvest losses and access of fish to the international market,” he said.</p>
      <p>He further announced that his ministry will employ and deploy more staff to the fisheries stations in the country.</p>
      <p>The conference was attended by government officials and Kisumu County officials led by the Governor Prof Anyang Nyong’o.</p>
      <p>Nyong’o lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for the energy he has shown for the revival of the lake following the modernization of Kisumu port.</p>
      <p>“First among this is the opportunity to revive maritime transport on the lake for regional trade, movement of goods and services as well as passengers,” he said.</p>
