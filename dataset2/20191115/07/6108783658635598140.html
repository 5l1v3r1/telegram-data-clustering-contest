      <h3>And will move to support the PS4's DualShock 4 and Razer gamepads.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud</a> will head to Windows 10 PC and “other devices” in 2020 alongside PS4 DualShock 4 controller support, Microsoft today confirmed as part of its Inside Xbox X019 livestream.</p>
      <p>“Mobile phones provide a fantastic on-the-go gaming experience, but our goal is to continue to provide people with even more ways to play,” Microsoft’s Kareem Choudhry said. “Next year, we’ll bring Project xCloud to Windows 10 PCs, and are collaborating with a broad set of partners to make game streaming available on other devices as well.”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear as to what those “other devices” include, but we’ll keep you informed as we learn more.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Choudhry also confirmed that, “in addition to using an Xbox One wireless controller, we’ll expand support to more Bluetooth controllers beginning next year, including the DualShock 4 wireless controller and game pads from Razer.”</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud preview</a> is currently available in three regions across iOS and Android devices, but <a href="https://stevivor.com/?p=163072">will expand to new regions including Canada, India, Japan and Western Europe</a> in 2020. From today, <a href="https://stevivor.com/?p=163057">50 new games have been added to the Project xCloud library</a>.</p>
