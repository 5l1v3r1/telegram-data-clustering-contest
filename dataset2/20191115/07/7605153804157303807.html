        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 15 – Tammy Abraham has set his sights on firing England to Euro 2020 glory after the Chelsea striker scored his first senior international goal in the demolition of Montenegro.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abraham came off the bench to wrap up England’s 7-0 victory at Wembley on Thursday as Gareth Southgate’s side booked their place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>His maiden England goal continued a memorable 2019 for the 22-year-old after winning promotion to the Premier League while on loan with Aston Villa last season and scoring 11 goals in 18 games for Chelsea this term.</p>
      <p>With three group games and a possible semi-final and final at Wembley, Euro 2020 is almost a home tournament for England and Abraham is confident Southgate’s men can get their hands on the silverware.</p>
      <p>“Being at the Euros, winning it, top four or top two in the Premier League. Just believing! The sky’s the limit,” Abraham said of his dreams for 2020.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, hopefully, I don’t want to jinx myself.”</p>
      <p>Asked if England can finally win their first major tournament since the 1966 World Cup, Abraham said: “I believe so.”</p>
      <p>Abraham’s game has gone to the next level this season, but he thinks he can get even better working alongside England captain Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>Kane took his tally to 31 goals for England with a hat-trick against Montenegro, moving the Tottenham forward above Alan Shearer, Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney on his country’s all-time list.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been a dream for me to be on the same pitch as him. Every day, I watch him, learn off him,” Abraham said.</p>
      <p>“To be on the same pitch with him, training with him every day, it’s always nice to have that type of player to learn from.</p>
      <p>“Even in training practising, you can see his professionalism. He wants to be the best, to have someone like that to look up to is a dream.”</p>
