      <h1>John Lewis selects Glasgow girl for starring role</h1>
      <h2>A ten-year-old Glasgow girl is the star of this year's John Lewis Christmas ad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:50:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:50</time> by <a rel="author">Kirsty McKenzie, Paul Smith</a></address>
      <p>Leading British retailer John Lewis's Christmas ads are always keenly anticipated.</p>
      <p>And Glasgow girl Ruby Dailly has beaten off thousands of youngsters to bag the starring role in this year's version which hit our screens on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The ten-year-old budding star plays the best friend of Excitable Edgar, an over-excitable Christmas dragon.</p>
      <p>Glasgow Live reports that Ruby stars as Ava, a young girl in a medieval world, who looks after a dragon who struggles to contain his excitement over Christmas - and as a consequence breathes fire over everything.</p>

      <p>Edgar melts an ice rink and destroys the village Christmas tree - but best friend Ava is there to give him a helping hand. She helps everyone accept him, even though he's different.</p>
      <p>Ruby won the role of a lifetime after John Lewis conducted castings across London, Manchester and Scotland to find their perfect Ava.</p>
      <p>This is Ruby debut appearance on screens, as she hasn't appeared in any other films or shows so far, but it certainly won't be her last.</p>
