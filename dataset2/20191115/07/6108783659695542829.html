      <h3>Shades of Away: The Survival Series, anyone?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/grounded/"><i>Grounded</i></a> is the next game from <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/the-outer-worlds/"><i>The Outer World</i>‘s</a> Obsidian Entertainment, Microsoft today announced at X019.</p>
      <p>The title, a first-person, co-op survival game, will be the first Xbox Game Preview title available on Xbox Game Pass. It will enter its preview stage in autumn 2020 here in Australia, or spring 2020 in North America.</p>
      <p>“In <i>Grounded</i>, players are shrunken to the size of an ant and tasked with surviving in the unique micro- world of a suburban backyard,” Mikey Dowling of Obsidian said. “Players must gather, craft and build bases with everyday objects found within the yard, searching for life-saving resources and living alongside giant, peaceful insects while fighting to survive massive hostile inhabitants.</p>
      <p>“<i>Grounded</i> provides a mix of environmental and narrative driven story telling. Set in a versatile, handcrafted sandbox structure it allows players to create their own experience from the ground up. Tasks that may seem approachable when human-sized become a challenge in this dangerous backyard landscape. This familiar yet fantastical world can be navigated solo or in four-person co-operative multiplayer, where players work together to complete missions or explore the intricately detailed world.”</p>
      <p>Obsidian has confirmed that <i>Grounded </i>is being made by a “small development team” and is “one of many working on new projects in the studio”. Obsidian noted that <i>Grounded </i>is a departure from the studio, though “RPGs like <i>The Outer Worlds</i> will always be in Obsidian’s DNA.”</p>
      <p>“From time to time we want to stretch our creative muscles and try things that might be a little different,” Downling said.</p>
      <p>We’ll have more on <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/grounded/">Grounded</a> </i>as it becomes available.</p>
