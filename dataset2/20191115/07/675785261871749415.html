      <h2>Emma Louise Sanders, 30, has revealed her Tinder dating disasters - including an engaged cheater she outed - in a bid to give young women an insight into the world of online dating</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:12:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:12</time> by <a rel="author">Paige Ingram</a></address>
      <p>A mum has told of her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tinder">Tinder</a> dating disasters - from a lying scoundrel who was secretly engaged to a 'broke' date who had to ask his dad to pay for their meal.</p>
      <p>Emma Louise Sanders, 30, has considered writing a book about all of the dates that have gone off the rails, some before they even started.</p>
      <p>She regularly used the dating app for two years before finding her Mr Right, swiping right hundreds of times and left probably many more times than she could count, <a href="https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/essex-mums-brutal-tinder-date-3533683">Essex Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Emma, from Rainham, Essex, has lifted the lid on some of the truly awful dates she went on in a bid to give young women an insight into the world of online dating.</p>

      <p>Here are some of her horror stories.</p>
      <h3>The twin who bragged about his finances but couldn't pay for the meal</h3>
      <p>As fancy as cocktails and dinner in the London Sky Garden restaurant sounds, this date ended in disaster.</p>
      <p>Emma's date was a twin, but she had no idea which one to expect.</p>
      <p>"His pictures were always with the twin so I had no idea who was who," she said. </p>
      <p>“One was slightly less good-looking and a bit heavy set, and that is the one who showed up to meet me."</p>
      <p>After bragging about his finances and showing off his brand new Apple watch, Emma says he took a phone call from his dad at the table, leaving her alone to admire the London skyline.</p>
      <p>About £100 later, after her date insisted on buying cocktails, they decided to call it a night and get the bill. </p>
      <p>"It was a really expensive dinner," she said.</p>
      <p>

      <p>"I really didn't want to even pay my share as he ordered me drinks even though I said I didn't want them and then drank them himself."</p>
      <p>But the date was far from over for Emma. </p>
      <p>When attempting to pay using his credit card, it was declined three times.</p>
      <p>He then went on to explain how he had a £2,000 limit and even showed Emma his banking app, which is when she noticed he had in fact spent £1,925 of that limit. </p>
      <p>As if that wasn't embarrassing enough, he then left the restaurant to withdraw cash from an ATM outside, leaving Emma waiting for an hour at the table.</p>
      <p>"I had to stay there with my bank card behind the counter - which only had about £7.50 on it because he had already insisted I wouldn't need any money - while he phoned his dad to transfer him some money."</p>
      <p>When the bill was eventually settled, the pair parted ways.</p>
      <p>But this was not the last time they met.</p>

      <p>During their date, Emma had taken a photo of their meal and tagged him in a Facebook post - only for his long-term girlfriend to see it and message her the following morning.</p>
      <p>"The guy was a compulsive liar," Emma said.</p>
      <p>Emma then arranged to meet the man again, this time at a local restaurant where she knew the staff.</p>
      <p>"When I questioned him he hung his head low and didn't say much." she said.</p>
      <p>Emma paid for her meal and made him pay for his, after telling him to leave. </p>
      <h3>The engaged man who got caught out by Facebook</h3>
      <p>After two weeks of chatting on Tinder, Emma arranged a date and exchanged phone numbers with one man.</p>
      <p>But a simple <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> search of his mobile number revealed he wasn't being all that truthful to her. </p>
      <p>"His profile picture was of him clearly with a significant other and his cover photo was an engagement ring on her hand," Emma said.</p>
      <p>"I immediately screenshotted our conversations where he said his relationship status was 'complicated' as well as complimenting me on my looks and arranging a date and sent the message to his fianceé, two of his male friends and two of her female friends."</p>
      <p>When Emma confronted the man about his fianceé, he blocked her number and Tinder account before deleting the app altogether. </p>
      <p>But that wasn't the last Emma would hear from him.</p>
      <p>One month on, one of the female friends Emma had previously contacted got back in touch. </p>
      <p>"She thanked me for the information," Emma said. "Apparently he had been cheating on her for a while and she had her suspicions and when confronted with what I had sent he admitted it. </p>
      <p>“She accepted it and they were still planning to be married."</p>
      <h3>The man who stood her up the day before her birthday</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Emma arranged to meet up with one man at Blackfriars Tube station after work one evening. </p>
      <p>But the man was a no show and to make matters worse, it was just a day before her birthday. </p>
      <p>"He WhatsApped me to say he was on his way," she said.</p>
      <p>"I got there five minutes early and after 15 minutes I WhatsApped him to say I was going outside to smoke.</p>
      <p>"I phoned my friend for advice who said he was probably stuck in the cab in traffic.</p>
      <p>“ When I went inside, I had a funny feeling so I checked the last message I had sent - it had that dreaded one tick [meaning it had not been read].</p>
      <p>"I looked on his Tinder and as I was reading messages it disappeared. I tried phoning him but it went straight to voicemail.</p>
      <p>"I have no idea what happened there, whether he had no intention of meeting me, or saw me then left."</p>
      <h3>"My perfect man was right in front of me all along"</h3>

      <p>Emma has now been Tinder-free for three-and-a-half years. </p>
      <p>In 2016, after deleting the app, she met up with an old friend called Danny and they hit it off.</p>
      <p>"We met at school in GCSE music," she said.</p>
      <p>“We both fancied each other but he was in the 'popular group' and I was bullied a lot for not following the crowd so nothing really happened.</p>
      <p>"We did flirt a bit but I thought he was being nice. He told me a picture on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> was hot with all the emojis and I replied 'aww thanks mate' then I found out he was planning on going travelling and decided to make my move."</p>
      <p>On their first night together, the pair ordered Chinese and watched the England football match. For Emma, “it just felt right".</p>
      <p>They only had five short months together before Danny jetted off to Thailand on his travels.</p>
      <p>Less than a week into his trip, Emma flew out to celebrate his birthday, Christmas and New Year.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On their return to the UK, Danny moved into Emma’s family home before they moved back down under.</p>
      <p>Emma and Danny lived together in Australia for a few months but when Emma found out she was pregnant with her first child they moved back to the UK for good.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, their son, Callum, was born and the family-of-three now live together in a privately-rented house in Rainham.</p>
      <p>"Having gone through all the bad dates makes both my boys worthwhile," Emma said.</p>
      <p>"Everyone kept telling me that and I was so eager to meet someone and settle down by a certain age.</p>
      <p>"I’ve ended up the happiest I’ve even been with someone who was a friend for years and listened to my heartache.</p>
      <p>"Three-and-a-half years, several countries lived in and one child later we’re incredibly happy. My perfect man was right in front of me all along, I just couldn’t see it."</p>
      <h3>Emma's dating advice</h3>
      <p>Emma spent two years on Tinder and has some advice for young women who are currently on the app.</p>
      <p>She said: "If he doesn’t call or message back then leave him be and move on.</p>
      <p>"Trust your gut. If he’s been to prison and doesn’t have a full time job or act his age and it doesn't feel right then don’t give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>
      <p>"Don’t get stressed about not getting matches or only getting fools messaging you. The right person will be there when you least expect it."</p>
