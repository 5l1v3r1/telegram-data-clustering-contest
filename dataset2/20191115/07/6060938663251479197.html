          <b>Bala Movie Review : Bald is beautiful, indeed</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>According to the latest report on Boxofficeindia.com, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Amar-Kaushik">Amar Kaushik</a> directorial which registered Ayushmann's biggest opener with Rs 9.50 crore has gone on to rake in a staggering figure of Rs 69.25 crore in its first week.</p>
      <p>While the film looked adamant to surpass the collections of Ayushmann's previous release '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dream-Girl">Dream Girl</a>' of Rs 70.12, the multi-starrer comic caper fell just short of excelling in the domestic circuit. The drastic drop on Wednesday could be termed as the reason for not exceeding the collections of 'Dream Girl' but 'Bala' picked up well on Thursday especially in North India.</p>
      <p>The film which also features <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bhumi-Pednekar">Bhumi Pednekar</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Yami-Gautam">Yami Gautam</a> in pivotal roles has been garnering good response from the audience as well as the critics. The film which is set in the backdrop of Kanpur revolves around a man suffering from premature balding due to which he suffers from lack of confidence and societal pressure which has been well showcased by Ayushmann.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the versatile actor is currently shooting for his next 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' in Varanasi. He'll soon be collaborating with his 'Badhaai Ho' co-stars Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao once again in the film which revolves around a conservative family and how they deal with the fact that their son is homosexual. 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' will also feature Jeetendra Kumar as Ayushmannâ€™s love interest in the film.</p>
