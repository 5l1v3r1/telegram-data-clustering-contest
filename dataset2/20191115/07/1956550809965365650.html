      <p>If you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/416304-dubais-best-swim-up-pool-bars">swim-up bars</a> (and let’s face it, who’s not?, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/416304-dubais-best-swim-up-pool-bars">click here for more</a>) then you’ll be familiar with this super-cool spot at The Ritz-Carlton, Dubai. But if you’ve spent your time sipping a mixed drink in the cool pool rather than dining, things are set to change. As part of Eat, Sip, Save La Baie is offering up a deal you’d be mad to miss. For Dhs150 you’ll get pool access, plus the whole thing back on food and drink at the pool bar. Meanwhile, if you visit between 4pm and 6pm any day of the week you’ll get Italian bubbly for half price. Pack those swimmers.<br/><i>Open daily 11am-11pm. The Ritz-Carlton Dubai, The Walk, JBR (04 318 6150).</i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/419441-the-best-pizza-in-new-york-is-coming-to-dubai-this-october"><b>Motorino</b></a><br/>This brand-new pizza place has a top deal to try this month. Buy any pizza and you’ll get another one, plus a carafe of house grape, absolutely free. Hailing from New York, this cool new spot is in JA Ocean View hotel and looks like a top place to check out.<br/><i>Prices vary. JA Ocean View Hotel, JBR (04 814 5590).</i><br/><br/><b>Observatory Bar &amp; Grill</b><br/>This sky-high restaurant in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/dubai-marina%20is%20serving%20a%20three-course">Dubai Marina</a> menu for Dhs199 during November, so you can dig into a feast while overlooking the Marina and Palm. Not in the mood for a full meal? Fret not, there’s a bar bite and glass of hops with your name on it for Dhs80.<br/><i>Open daily noon-1am.

      <p>This super beach bar and restaurant has one of the best locations in Dubai. With stunning views across the sea you can enjoy dining with your feet in the sand, for that proper holiday feel. And this month you’ll be spoiled as the restaurant is offering two special deals. If you’re after a snack, head here for sundowners as you’ll get two drinks and light bites for just Dhs99 per person, every day from 4pm until 7pm. And if that’s not enough for you, the restaurant is offering pool and beach access plus a family-style lunch for two people from Sunday to Thursday for Dhs495.<br/><i>Open daily noon-11pm. The Ritz-Carlton Dubai, The Walk, JBR (04 318 6150).</i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/splendido-restaurant"><b>Splendido</b></a><br/>There are few cuisines more romantic than <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397978-dubais-best-italian-restaurants-2019">Italian</a>, which is why Splendido has date night written all over it. And between November 1 and November 30 you’ll get two main <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/389565-dubais-best-pasta-dishes-2019">courses</a> and a bottle of grape for Dhs295 per couple. A date night for under Dhs250 for two? You can’t say fairer than that. Our advice? Book a seat outside amid the twinkly lights and pretty gardens for the ultimate romantic night out.<br/><i>Open daily 6pm-11pm. The Ritz-Carlton Dubai, The Walk, JBR (04 399 4000).</i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/the-blacksmith"><b>The Blacksmith</b></a></p>

      <p>There’s no shortage of Deep South-inspired <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurant-awards-2019/397995-dubais-best-steakhouses-2019">meateries</a> in this city, but The Blacksmith is among the most authentic in town so if you’re mad about meat, this is the deal for you. Sample the belly-busting Texas Brisket Sandwich – a fresh potato roll layered with 14-hour smoked brisket and topped with pickles, onions and barbecue sauce, and a pint for just Dhs69. Lip-smackingly good, all for under Dhs100.<br/><i>Open Sun-Wed 5pm-2am, Thu-Sat 5pm-3am. Wyndham Dubai Marina, Dubai Marina (04 407 8873).</i></p>
