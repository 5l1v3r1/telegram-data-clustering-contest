      <h1>ShunSin to ramp up capex in 2020 for SiP capacity expansion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T07:29:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 07:29</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>ShunSin Technology, Foxconn Technology Group's IC backend service affiliate, will be ramping up its capex next year to better meet growing demand for packaging high-speed fiber-optic modules as well as SiP service for 5G mobile communication modules, according to company chairman Frank Hsu.</p>
      <p>High-speed fiber optical modules now contribute nearly 50% of the firm's revenues, followed by 22% for 3D biometric sensing modules with high gross margins, and 20% for SiP services for handset-use sensors, RF-FEM (radio frequency front-end modules) and PA-FEM (power amplifier FEM).</p>
      <p>Hsu said demand for 5G RF and PA modules is expected to surge significantly along with 5G commercialization, prompting his company to boost its capex for 2020 to a high of NT$1.5 billion (US$49.12 million) to expand SiP capacity and increase optical-fiber modules processing equipment.</p>
      <p>Hsu said ShunSin will not rule out additional investments in developing high-end double-side SiP technology and AiP (antenna in package) solution in 2020 for processing ever-slimmer peripheral ICs needed for 5G handsets.</p>
      <p>The company has landed SiP packaging orders from the world's top-4 handset PA components makers, and is likely to add Chinese PA chip designers as its clients in 2020.</p>
      <p>SunSin is also expected to gain significantly from demand for RF-FEMs for use in 5G handsets and base stations, servers, and datacenters in 2020 and beyond.</p>
      <p>The company has also indirectly tapped into the supply chains of web giants in the US and China, and is poised to reap well from mounting demand for 400G optical transceiver modules in 2020 from datacenter operators.</p>
