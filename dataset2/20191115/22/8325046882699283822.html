      <p>While you can transfer funds from your PayPal account to your bank for free, there is a fee for instant transfers: 1% of the transfer amount, capped at $10 per transaction.</p>
      <p>You’d also pay a fee to send money to a friend or family member using a debit or credit card. In that case, the fee would be 2.9% plus a fixed amount that varies depending on the currency used.</p>
      <p>There are additional fees for sending money to people who live in other countries. For example, you’d pay at least 5% of the amount you planned on sending, plus $0.99 to $4.99, depending on your circumstances.</p>
      <p>If you were to use a credit or debit card to fund these transfers, you’d also pay a funding fee of 2.9% plus a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#fixed-fees">fixed fee</a> that varies depending on the receiver’s country of residence.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you were to sell items and use PayPal as your payment processor, you’ll pay <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#selling">fees</a> on each transaction:</p>
