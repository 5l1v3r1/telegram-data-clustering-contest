      <h1>Mohamed Salah shares ankle treatment video as Liverpool star steps up injury recovery</h1>
      <h2>The Reds forward is still trying to shake off an ongoing problem he originally sustained in a crunching tackle with Leicester's Hamza Choudhury on October 5</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:35:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-salah">Mohamed Salah</a> has offered an insight into his continuing rehabilitation from the ankle injury he suffered at the beginning of last month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> forward has been struggling to fully recover from the problem after Hamza Choudhury's heavy tackle forced him out of the clash against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on October 5.</p>
      <p>Salah has played for his club since, but aggravated the issue in the win over Man City just days after boss <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> admitted the injury was not going away.</p>
      <p>The original tackle from Choudhury left Salah with a sprained ankle, but Klopp revealed the Egyptian still has fluid around the joint which re-appears after exercise.</p>
      <p>"I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that," Klopp said.</p>

      <p>Salah was substituted late on in the win over City last Sunday, shortly after Fernandinho's tackle looked to have caused him further damage.</p>
      <p>He was grimacing with pain after the challenge, and was then seen with ice strapped to his ankle at full-time.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old reported for international duty with Egypt the following day, but after undergoing scans it was decided he would play no part in his country's fixtures with Kenya and Comoros.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were anxious at allowing Salah to go away with Egypt without having properly assessed his injury, while the star wore a protective boot as a precaution.</p>

      <p>However since his withdrawal from the international squad, Salah has uploaded a video of himself receiving treatment on his ankle from Liverpool club physio Richie Partridge.</p>
      <p>He now has just over a week to regain full fitness before Liverpool's next fixture against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in the Premier League on November 23.</p>
