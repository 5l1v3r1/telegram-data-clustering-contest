      <p>Brian McGinty is praying Irvine Meadow can cling on to the coat-tails of Premiership leaders Kilwinning ahead of a derby showdown at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>Second-placed Meadow travel to Largs on league duty this Saturday before hosting Glenafton in a Scottish Junior Cup fourth round tie the following weekend.</p>
      <p>With Kilwinning already out of the Scottish, Chris Strain’s side have an opportunity to steal a march on Meadow before the sides meet at Buffs Park on November 30.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinty is desperate not to lose too much ground and is challenging his players do the double over Largs by taking all three points at Barrfields.</p>
      <p>He said: “We know if we win we are guaranteed to still be sitting second going into the Kilwinning game, regardless of what other teams do.</p>
      <p>“That’s the carrot for the players. We know Kilwinning can pull away from us but it’s about keeping that to a minimum by doing our bit.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a really tough game against Largs. They are a very good team and Stuart Davidson always has them very well organised.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of big games coming up this month but at this moment in time, Largs is the biggest and that’s where our full focus is.”</p>
      <p>Meadow go into the clash on the back of a 3-1 win away to Thorniewood United in the first round of the West of  Scotland Cup.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinty reshuffled his pack for the clash and reckons making full use of his squad will be crucial for such an important run of matches. He said: “Its more about getting boys game time than resting players. We want everyone to be ready for the schedule ahead.”</p>
      <p>Striker Adam Forsyth made his long awaited return from injury by coming off the bench for the last 10 minutes and comes into consideration for Saturday.</p>
