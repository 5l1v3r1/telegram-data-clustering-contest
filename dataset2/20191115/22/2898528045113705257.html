      <h1>Maycee Barber vs. Roxanne Modafferi set for UFC 246</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">MMA Fighting Newswire</a></address>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4554/maycee-barber">Maycee Barber</a>’s next fight, she’ll be up against one of the most experienced women in MMA.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old flyweight is expected to face 39-fight veteran <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/581/roxanne-modafferi">Roxanne Modafferi</a> in a flyweight bout at UFC 246 on Jan. 18 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, MMA Fighting confirmed the matchup with multiple people with knowledge of the booking, who asked to remain anonymous, following an initial report by <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/maycee-barber-vs-roxanne-modafferi-ufc-246-fight-booking">MMA Junkie</a>.</p>
      <p>Barber, who improved to 8-0 with a first-round TKO of <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4162/gillian-robertson">Gillian Robertson</a> this past October, had been campaigning for a matchup with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2025/paige-vanzant">Paige VanZant</a>, but VanZant countered by announcing she was interested in fighting any flyweight <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/10/23/20929066/paige-vanzant-ready-to-fight-any-ufc-strawweight-or-flyweight-no-interest-in-maycee-barber">except for Barber</a>. Though Barber <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4BXt04p5x9/">posted</a> a video on Instagram in which she continued to pursue the fight, it appears that all parties involved are moving on for now.</p>
      <p>Modafferi (23-16) is coming off of a unanimous decision loss to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2274/jennifer-maia">Jennifer Maia</a> in July. The 37-year-old has alternated wins and losses in her last six outings, which includes wins over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4667/antonina-shevchenko">Antonina Shevchenko</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1784/barb-honchak">Barb Honchak</a>. She is in her second stint with the UFC and has previously competed for a number of notable organizations including Invicta FC, Strikeforce, and Japan’s Jewels promotion.</p>
