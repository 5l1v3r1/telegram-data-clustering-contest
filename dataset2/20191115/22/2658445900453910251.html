      <p>FAST-GROWING cinema chain, VIVA Cinemas,  is set to open its latest cinema in Lagos at the Ikeja Bus Terminal before the end of November.</p>
      <p>Currently operating in five sites across Ilorin, Ibadan, Ota and Enugu, and boasting of over 20% market share in the industry, VIVA Cinemas uses a 4K cinema projectors to achieve clear picture and sound clarity in 2D and 3D.</p>
      <p>The outfit, which has since inception in 2015, gained quite a reputation for its quality service, will be offering an amazing mix of experiences designed to treat cinema lovers to a variety of Nollywood, Hollywood and Bollywood blockbuster movies.</p>
      <p>Following a brief demo of the tech-advanced projector to a select media audience in Lagos recently, VIVA CEO, Heri Ntimizi explained that: “On a bigger screen, the 4K image is simply better, so much so that some people who’ve witnessed a long-distance shot rendered in 4K have mistaken it for glasses-free 3D! The larger the screen, the more 4K is required due to the inevitable pixel enlargement. At VIVA Cinemas, we like to ensure definition is maintained and at a minimal viewing cost.”</p>

      <p>He added that “Aside the movie experience within our screens, our teams across our cinemas are committed to creating thrilling entertainment &amp; leisure destinations that teleport our visitors from their everyday lives into an extraordinary world of magic.”</p>
      <p>For a 16:9 ratio, 4K contains almost four times the pixels of HD. This means a clearer, more detailed image. The higher pixel count also allows for closer viewing by the audience without loss in quality of the content on the screen.</p>
