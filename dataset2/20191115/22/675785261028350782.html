      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Sir Alex Ferguson once said he wanted to knock Liverpool's Liver bird off its perch - now Jurgen Klopp is on course to reverse that quote with the philosophy of Bill Shankly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Walters, https://www.facebook.com/Mike-Walters-Mirror</a></address>
      <p>Under the burning Queensland sun, Robbie Fowler weaved through the rush hour as expertly as he once gave Premier League defenders the slip.</p>
      <p>The new head coach at Brisbane Roar in Australia’s upgraded A-League had calls to make and training was starting at 9am, before the heat became too oppressive for his players.</p>
      <p>But whatever the traffic could throw at him along Vulture Street, past the Gabba cricket ground where England batsmen normally wilt, nothing was going to wipe the smile from Fowler’s face.</p>
      <p>Back home, 10,000 miles away, the table reads like a love letter to exiled <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legends.</p>

      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson once talked of knocking the Liver bird off its perch as he plotted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ’s domination of the title race for two decades.</p>
      <p>But there is a changing of the guard in the birdcage – more or less – and Kop legend Fowler, who scored 183 goals in 369 games for Liverpool, senses there will never be a better opportunity to bring the title back to his spiritual home than with the team Jurgen Klopp has built.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just a question of reclaiming its place on the perch Fergie talked about – the Liver bird is soaring,” said Fowler.</p>
      <p>“For the generation of fans who have never seen Liverpool win the title, there is a sense that Jurgen is giving the club its pride back.</p>

      <p>“To reach the Champions League final two years running is not down to luck. You don’t come back from a three-goal deficit against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in a semi-final by just hoping the noise of Anfield will frighten them and the cards will fall your way.</p>
      <p>“He knows what he is doing. He understands the touchstone for success is straight from Bill Shankly’s philosophy: He wants to make the people happy.</p>
      <p>“That means playing the right way – whether it’s called rock and roll football, heavy metal football or whatever – with a work ethic that gives his team a realistic chance of winning. He recognises that success on the pitch has to be earned and is not a God-given right.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool have always won stuff, or been in contention for trophies, but when you think of the Klopp era – and how close they came to the title last season – all of a sudden it makes you realise that when I played, we never really came close.</p>

      <p>“Now they have a genuine chance of being champions for the first time in 30 years. It’s not over by a long chalk – there are 26 games to go – but eight points is a big gap. This is Liverpool’s time.”</p>
      <p>Fowler is only four games into his adventure in Oz, but this could be a momentous season: As well as Klopp making the Liver bird soar, the striker christened ‘God’ by the Kop wants to make the Brisbane Roar, er... roar.</p>
      <p>He does not regard his assignment Down Under as a stepping stone to bigger things back home, but why shouldn’t he aim to become Liverpool manager one day?</p>
      <p>He said: “I was always a confident lad on the football field, I always believed I was better than everyone else.</p>

      <p>“There’s a fine line between confidence and arrogance, and between them, my family and the Liverpool coaching staff would never have allowed me to walk the wrong side of the line.</p>
      <p>“But I have the same passion for the game now that I had as a striker – and that passion makes me want to be the best at whatever I do.</p>
      <p>“If I’m going to be successful as a coach or manager, I’m aiming for the top – and right now, the top means Liverpool... but I don’t think Jurgen has any plans to go somewhere else any time soon.”</p>
      <p>Regrets? Fowler’s had a few, and they are chronicled in his new autobiography, released this week. But then again, the regrets are heavily outnumbered by the goals.</p>
      <p>There was a controversial goal celebration against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> , a tasteless taunt aimed at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> ’s Graeme Le Saux and a strangely unfulfilled England career.</p>
      <p>“I would probably have done the goal celebration against Everton again because it was my answer to the fearful stick I was getting.</p>
      <p>“But I’m not proud of the Graeme Le Saux thing. That was me being a tool, trying to belittle an opponent.</p>
      <p>“And I didn’t really enjoy my England career. I don’t want to sound crass or ignorant, because I played around the same time as Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright and Les Ferdinand, and there was never going to be room in the same side for all of us.”</p>
