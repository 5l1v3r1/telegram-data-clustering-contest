      <h1>'You're a disgrace': Don Trump Jr. claims George Conway 'routinely &amp; publicly embarrasses his wife'</h1>

      <p>Donald Trump Jr. and George Conway tangled on Twitter the same day public impeachment hearings were taking place, attacking each other in connection to their family members.</p>
      <p>The fight started after Trump tweeted Friday, "America hired @realDonaldTrump to fire people like the first three witnesses we’ve seen. Career government bureaucrats and nothing more."</p>

      <p>Conway, 56, responded by saying the ambassadors who had testified in the impeachment proceedings had more "honor" and "patriotism" than both President Trump and his son. The two then took shots at each other regarding their family members.</p>
      <p>"A guy who routinely &amp; publicly embarrasses his wife by attacking her boss for the purpose of getting retweets and building his own brand is giving lectures on honor, integrity &amp; decency," Trump Jr. said. "I'm sure your family really appreciates it, George. You're a disgrace."</p>

      <p>"By the way, I’m not building a brand because I’m not selling anything. And I’m not selling anything because I’ve worked for three decades at a job that my father didn’t get me," Conway shot back, referencing the president.</p>

      <p>Ahead of the first round of public impeachment hearings on Wednesday, Conway <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-dont-frankly-want-to-be-on-television-george-conway-makes-rare-tv-appearance-for-impeachment-hearings">appeared on MSNBC</a> as a commentator to discuss the proceedings. Kellyanne Conway, who is the counselor to the president and married to George Conway, was later asked about her husband's appearance by CNN's Wolf Blizter and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/im-embarrassed-for-you-kellyanne-conway-steams-after-clip-of-husbands-msnbc-commentary-played">said she was "embarrassed for"</a> both networks for using her husband against her.</p>
      <p>"You wanted to put it in my husband’s voice because you think somehow that that will help your ratings or that you’re really sticking it to Kellyanne Conway. And let me be very clear. You didn’t stick it to Kellyanne Conway," she said.</p>
