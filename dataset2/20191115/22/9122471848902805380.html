      <h1>USC at Cal: Game Time, Spread, Channel, Announcers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:14:53+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Believe it or not, the <a href="https://thespun.com/usc">USC Trojans</a> are still alive in the Pac-12 South Division race. USC is just one game behind Utah in the division, with the tiebreaker due to their win over the Utes in late September.</p>
      <p>But for now, all Clay Helton’s team will focus on is beating Cal on Saturday night. Quarterback Kedon Slovis will have to be sharp against a stingy Golden Bears defense which has several talented playmakers in the secondary.</p>
      <p>Cal had a great start to the season, rattling off four straight wins including victories over Washington and Ole Miss. But the Golden Bears have won just one of their last five games, with the offense taking a major hit with the <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2019/09/30/cal-football-rules-chase-garbers-out-long-term-with-potential-to-return-this-season/">injury to quarterback Chase Garbers</a> in the team’s first loss to Arizona State. They now sit at 5-4 with just a 2-4 record in conference play.</p>
      <p>Garbers may be able to go tomorrow, which would be a huge lift for the Golden Bears. This game means a lot to Cal, and the team will certainly be looking to upset USC on Saturday.</p>
