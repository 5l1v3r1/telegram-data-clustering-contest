      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:36:24+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Former One Direction star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/louis-tomlinson">Louis Tomlinson</a> held the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/children-in-need">Children In Need</a> stage for a single track this evening, belting out We Made It from his new album.</p>
      <p>Some viewers reckoned the 27 year old's performance resembled that of another musician - rock and roll legend and former Oasis man Liam Gallagher, 47.</p>
      <p>"Louis Tomlinson giving it the Liam Gallagher," one fan tweeted.</p>
      <p>Another laughed: "Louis Tomlinson is like Liam Gallagher - singing with his hands in his pockets a lot."</p>
      <p>A third penned: "#LouisTomlinson impersonating Liam Gallagher."</p>
      <p>Children In Need raised a total of Â£35.383,512 following a very glitzy opening with a special performance from Big the Musical.</p>
