        <b>BEEFY bookworm Anton Danyluk turns heads wherever he goes but the Love Island star is just as happy turning pages.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The reality TV fave shot to fame following his stint on the ITV dating show during the summer — and admits it’s been hard to adjust to his new-found celebrity status.</p>

      <p>But as well as pumping iron, the 25-year-old gym owner likes to lift the weight of stardom off his shoulders by burying his head in a good book.</p>
      <p>Anton says: “I wasn’t a big reader until a few years ago when I read The Secret by Rhonda Byrne and that completely changed who I am as a person.</p>
      <p>“Reading is something that helps to quiet your mind. I love doing it and escaping whatever is going on.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you can have too much going on in your head and reading can be calming.</p>
      <p>“It’s easy to forget that you’re also learning while you read. Knowledge is power and that’s why I read books when I’m on the go.”</p>

      <p>Anton’s recent passion for reading is why he’s right behind The Scottish Sun’s Free Books For Nurseries campaign in association with HarperCollins Publishers.</p>
      <p>Although mum Sherie Ann read to him religiously as a youngster, he admits he lost his love for books when he started school.</p>
      <p>Now he wants caregivers to really encourage little ones to let their imaginations run wild and have fun reading before it seems like a chore when they’re older.</p>
      <p>And he is urging nurseries to sign up to our £950,000 giveaway before registration closes at 11.59PM ON MONDAY.</p>
      <p>He says: “The younger you start reading the better. You want it to be viewed as something fun because it is.</p>

      <p>“Kids have such great imaginations and books are an amazing outlet for them to really enjoy themselves.</p>
      <p>"The sooner that kids get passionate about reading, the less of a chore it will seem when they are given books at school.</p>
      <p>“They will also be so much better at it as they feel more confident too.”</p>
      <p>And Anton — who <a href="http://bit.ly/2OkuNHb">recently split with his Love Island beau Belle Hassan</a>, 21 — thinks the first step to improving literacy rates is putting down the latest technology.</p>
      <p>Although he reckons iPads and iPhones have their place, he wants to see pre-schoolers picking up books instead.</p>
      <blockquote>"The sooner that kids get passionate about reading, the less of a chore it will seem when they are given books at school."<cite>Anton Danyluk</cite></blockquote>
      <p>He adds: “I still wish that I read more in school. And it was hard to reach kids then.</p>
      <p>“But it’s as hard as it has ever been now because they are all on tablets, phones and watching YouTube from a young age.</p>
      <p>“Getting back to basics is so important. They can get so engrossed in technology — which is great since they’re so technically aware — but it takes away from what is important too.</p>
      <p>“Learning to read — and to enjoy it — is so important for the rest of your life.”</p>
      <p>And no one knows that more than Anton’s mum.</p>
      <p>After she stopped going to school regularly at the age of eight, the 55-year-old credits books with boosting her education.</p>
      <p>Ever since Sherie Ann launched Scotland’s first popcorn-making business MacCorns in 1991, the life coach wanted to release a kids’ book with a positive message for the whole family.</p>
      <p>She felt like she was banging her head against a brick wall after trying to get published following Anton’s birth in 1994.</p>
      <p>But thanks to her newfound fame following Anton’s Love Island stint, Sherie Ann has decided to revive her book Meet The MacCorns of Scotland: The Funkie Fitness Family.</p>
      <p>Sherie Ann says: “I developed characters when Anton was born and started to create stories around them about being positively powerful popcorn people who explode to 42-times their size.</p>
      <p>“The characters teach the kids about how to be the best you can be in every way and how routines and healthy habits reap rewards.</p>
      <p>“It will help kids learn, in a fun way, how to do everyday routines like getting up and making the bed.</p>
      <p>“It’s a book that’s perfect for pre-school kids and their adults can read it to them.</p>
      <p>“But it’s also something that the whole family can enjoy together.”</p>
      <p>When Anton was young, Sherie Ann used to read to him every day about the popcorn people she was dreaming up.</p>

      <p>She thinks more adults should be trying to bring out the creative side of their kids.</p>
      <p>Sherie Ann says: “I’m more of a storyteller and I’d tell Anton that his mammy has these powerful popcorn people.</p>
      <p>“He loved it. It was so much fun for him.</p>
      <p>“I think with me leaving school so early, I realised I wanted to learn things and that the best way to do that was by reading things that were fun but also interesting and educational.</p>
      <p>“The problem nowadays is getting away from putting an iPad in their face.</p>
      <p>“Now they are all watching YouTube as toddlers.</p>
      <p>“I see it on holiday and I hate it. You are sitting having breakfast and the family don’t talk to the kids — they sit them in a high chair with a tablet watching cartoons.</p>
      <p>“Reading is so much fun. It’s important kids know that.”</p>
      <p>And now Anton can’t wait to see the book he helped inspire come to life when Sherie Ann’s debut goes to print.</p>
      <p>He hopes the popcorn characters he was fascinated by capture the imagination of other kids and helps them to find their passion for reading.</p>
      <p>Anton says: “I told mum she had to write this book because she’s so passionate about it.</p>
      <p>“She told me all about the characters as a kid and now we can use our platform to use them to get other kids reading too.</p>
      <p>“I’m so proud of her for trying to make a difference.”</p>
