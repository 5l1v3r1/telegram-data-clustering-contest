      <h1>2019 Mazda CX-30 Smashes A New Record</h1>
      <h2>This impressive record makes the Mazda CX-30 one of the safest cars on the road.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:55:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:55</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Last month, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/mazda-6">Mazda6 sedan</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-9">CX-9</a> crossover <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/2020-mazda6-and-cx-9-latest-achievements-are-mighty-impressive">earned a Top Safety Pick+ award</a> from the Institute for Highway Safety, cementing the Japanese automaker's reputation for making some of the safest cars on the road. And now the 2019 <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-30">Mazda CX-30</a> has smashed a new safety record that makes it one of the safest cars on the road today.</p>
      <p>The affordable subcompact SUV, which slots in between the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-3">CX-3</a> and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/cx-5">CX-5</a>, was recently tested to destruction in a series of crash tests by Euro NCAP, where it achieved an impressive near-perfect 99 percent score for Adult Occupant Protection â€“ the highest rating the organization has ever given for this category. This means the CX-30 has beaten the previous highest 98 percent rating achieved by the Volvo V40, Volvo XC60, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia">Alfa Romeo Giulia</a> and Mazda 3.</p>

      <p>The CX-30 also scored 86 percent for Child Occupant Protection, 80 percent for Vulnerable Road Users and 77 percent for Safety Assist features. Euro NCAP noted that the passenger compartment of the CX-30 remained stable in the frontal offset test and offered good protection for all body areas in the full-width rigid barrier test, scoring maximum points.</p>
      <p>It also scored maximum points in both the side barrier impact and the side pole test, while the SUV's Smart Brake Support assist avoided collisions at low speeds replicating typical city driving in all tests. Overall, the Mazda CX-30 achieved a five-star Euro NCAP safety rating.</p>

      <p>As standard, the Mazda CX-30 comes with seven airbags including side curtain airbags at the front and rear. Available safety tech includes blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, smart city brake support, a rear view camera, a direct tire pressure monitoring system, and pedestrian detection depending on the trim.</p>
      <p>"This is a truly impressive result. The Mazda CX-30 is a mainstream vehicle, available at an affordable price point, performing at the highest level in impact testing. In the event of an accident, there are few safer places to be than the front seats of the Mazda CX-30," said Matthew Avery, director of insurance research at, Thatcham Research. "The structure of the vehicle and the performance of its restraints are key. Especially in the side pole test which encourages carmakers to fit side-curtain airbags to protect occupants' heads in a collision." The Mercedes-Benz GLB and Ford Explorer were also awarded five star safety ratings in the latest round of Euro NCAP crash testing.</p>
