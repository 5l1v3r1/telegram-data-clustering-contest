      <h1>Jon Favreau is Serious About Making a New Star Wars Holiday Special</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:37:35+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:37</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Back in September, we <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/466249-jon-favreau-is-down-to-make-a-new-star-wars-holiday-special">posted a report</a> about director Jon Favreau looking into creating a new <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-holiday-special"><b>Star Wars</b></a><b> Holiday Special</b>. During a recent fan event for <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a> series, Favreau reiterated that he’s still working on it.</p>
      <p>“Oh, I would definitely be interested in doing a <b>Holiday Special</b>,” reiterated Favreau in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/jon-favreau-star-wars-life-day-1203405427/">Variety</a>. “And I’m not going to say who I would be interested in. But one of the people is a member of the cast in an upcoming episode of the show. So we’ll leave it at that for now.”</p>
      <p>As for why he feels a new <b>Star Wars</b> <b>Holiday Special</b> would make sense, Favreau provided further explanation. </p>
      <p>“I’ve been thinking about it. It’s ready, the ideas are ready. I think it could be really fun. Not as part of this, but there’s an excitement around it because it was so fun and weird, and off and not connected to what <b>Star Wars</b> was in the theater. ‘The Mandalorian’ cartoon, the Boba Fett cartoon, from the holiday special was definitely a point of inspiration for what we did in the show.”</p>

      <p>The original <b>Star Wars Holiday Special</b> aired in 1978 and immediately became a cult classic. While some see it as a disaster, others enjoyed its humorous tone and characters. Even <a href="https://www.rifftrax.com/the-star-wars-holiday-special">Rifftrax</a> got into the action with a custom riff for the special, complete with commentary for its commercials.</p>
      <p>There’s no further word on when Favreau would begin production on the show, or if Disney would even greenlight it. But considering the success of <b>The Mandalorian</b> on Disney+, it’s not impossible. Favreau has already shown he can weave holiday magic with <b>Elf</b>.</p>
      <p>What do you think about the idea of a new <b>Star Wars</b><b> Holiday Special</b>? Who would you want to see on it? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
