      <h1>Jack Ross pledges to restore underachieving Hibs as one of Scottish football's 'leading clubs'</h1>
      <h2>The 43-year-old landed the Easter Road job tonight and will be officially unveiled by the club on Monday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross landed the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> job tonight and pledged to restore the underachieving Edinburgh club as a major force in Scottish football.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old has agreed a three-and-a-half year deal to take charge in Leith just a month after he was sacked by <br/>Sunderland and will be officially unveiled at Easter Road on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> will then take charge of his first match against Motherwell on November 23 as he looks to kick on from last week’s 4-1 win over St Johnstone after a horror run of just one win in 90 minutes in 14 games in all competitions under axed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> .</p>
      <p>Heckingbottom was sacked on November 4 following a 5-2 Betfred Cup semi-final defeat by Celtic and <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>exclusively revealed yesterday Ross, also interviewed by rivals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> in their managerial hunt, was the man the Hibs hierarchy wanted.</p>
      <p>Ross enjoyed successful spells at Alloa and St Mirren before moving south of the border to the Stadium of Light but was binned by the Black Cats after just 18 months in charge.</p>
      <p>He was assisted by James Fowler in the north east but the Kilmarnock legend won’t be following Ross to Easter Road after he was yesterday appointed head of football operations at Rugby Park.</p>

      <p>But the arrival of Ross will be a popular choice in Leith and the former St Mirren boss insists a collective effort is required from all at Easter Road to lift the side’s fortunes this season.</p>
      <p>He said: “We all consider Hibs to be one of the leading clubs in Scottish football – in terms of the history and passion of the supporters.</p>
      <p>“It’s up to all of us to help the squad live up to that. We have some talented players, underpinned by a successful academy, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure we’re able to help every player fulfil his potential.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hibs chief Leeann Dempster, who led the hunt for a new boss along with sporting director Graeme Mathie, said Ross made a “very strong impression”.</p>
      <p>Dempster added: “We are confident Jack, along with the staff at Easter Road and Hibs Training Centre, will help drive this club forward and we’ll do everything we can as a board to support that.”</p>
