      <p>The Yoma Group, which is comprised of two holding companies, Singapore-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd. (YSH) and Myanmar-listed First Myanmar Investment Public Co. Ltd. (FMI), is selling a maximum 20 percent stake to Ayala for up to US$237.5 million, making Ayala the second largest investor in both entities.</p>
      <p>Ayala said in a statement that this is a milestone international transaction in its history, and the biggest ever Philippine conglomerate investment into Myanmar.</p>
      <p>“Our partnership with the Yoma Group gives Ayala a unique opportunity to participate in Myanmar’s growth story,” said Ayala Chairman &amp; CEO Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala.</p>
      <p>He noted that, “we could not imagine a better way to do this than with the Pun family, whose solid, decades-long reputation as a business house has cemented their expertise in multiple sectors such as real estate, banking, automotive, healthcare, power, and tourism, among others.”</p>
      <p>“We have always believed that ASEAN has massive potential to reap the benefits of Asia’s rise in the global economy. Ayala can definitely move closer to this aspiration by working with a respected and diversified conglomerate in the region,” Zobel added.</p>
      <p>Myanmar’s underpenetrated market is the second fastest growing in the region with GDP growth over 6 percent year on year for the last three years.</p>
      <p>With its unique geographic location between India and China to the North, Myanmar incentivizes the construction of multiple infrastructure projects and Special Economic Zones.</p>
      <p>Its government’s broad liberalization initiatives have opened several key sectors to foreign investment, with real estate alone acquiring over US$4 billion in foreign investment since 2012 when Myanmar transitioned to democratic rule.</p>
