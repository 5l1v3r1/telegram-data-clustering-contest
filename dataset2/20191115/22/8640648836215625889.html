      <p>Sunday is National Baklava Day. Like many of the commemorations the origins of this one are murky, but at least one benefit is not. Bok Bok Chicken will give a free piece of baklava to anyone who dines in or gets takeout on Sunday, limit one per person.</p>
      <p>Bok Bok Chicken (<a href="https://www.bokbokchicken.com/">bokbokchicken.com</a>) has five locations in Southern Nevada.</p>
