              <b>ST-W vs BH-W Dream11 : With a win for Brisbane Heat taking them to the annuls of the league standings, the side will be looking to be ruthless and relentless today</b>
            </p>
            <p>Currently in second place in the Women’s Big Bash League with the five wins and three defeats from eight matches, Brisbane Heat will be looking to continue in their galloping ways come today and canter into the pinnacles of the points tally. A win for the side would see them move above Sydney Sixers by virtue of a better net run-rate, something which is bound to buoy the side for today’s imminent contest.</p>
            <p>The side make an advent into the festival weekend having walked all over last place Melbourne Stars the last time around. Despite stepping out in pursuit of what was bound to be a dicey 166 run target, the side ended up easing their way to a colossal 9 wicket win courtesy of an immaculate batting display by their top-order to massively propel their net run-rate.</p>

                  <p>Elsewhere, playing their second match in as many days, for Sydney Thunder a win takes immense precedence after the side were defeated by table toppers Sydney Sixers yesterday. Failing to persevere in a low scoring encounter, the side faltered by 40 runs as they kept losing wickets at crucial junctures with their batting order completely failing to rise to the occasion.</p>
                  <p>Needing 15 to win, the side could only muster up a mere 112 in reply to slump into fifth place with the four wins and four defeats apiece. Another loss today would massively hamper their chances of challenging for a spot into the next round, a clash which the side know they can’t afford to slip up in at any moment.</p>

                        <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                        <p>The surface has traditionally been a sluggish one but with this being the first match of the season to be contested here, we envisage the fresh track to be slightly more favourable for the bats. It will waver and wane quickly though to see the spinners come into full affect, leading the side winning the toss opting to step out and bat first.</p>

                              <h3>ST-W vs BH-W Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                              <p>Needing 60 balls to pile on the 70 runs in the bygone clash to see her side cruise to a 9 wicket win, Beth Mooney’s match winning knock sees her find a place in our Dream 11 unit for the day.</p>
                              <h3>ST-W vs BH-W Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                              <p>She will be partnered up by her counterpart who scored 56 in 33 balls the last time around as the two string together a gargantuan 92 run partnership for the opening wicket in the foregone affair. From the other side meanwhile we have decided to venture into today’s fixture with the duo of Alex Blackwell and Phoebe Litchfield, two players who couldn’t score big yesterday but managed to stick around for a good amount of balls to show their resilience.</p>
                              <h3>ST-W vs BH-W Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                              <p>Her 37 unbeaten runs in the side’s foregone contest alongside her role as a frontline bowler for the outfit makes her the pinch perfect all-rounder to immerse in given the repertoire of skill set imbued in the player. Sammy Jo-Johnson’s restrictive line and length rewarded her with figures of 1-23 in the same encounter to make her the second choice from the side.</p>
                              <p>Elsewhere from Sydney Thunder we have decided to immerse in Hannah Darlington after she scored 23 runs in the lower middle-order and rescue her side from collapsing from under 100 runs.</p>
                              <h3>ST-W vs BH-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                              <p>Delissa Kimmince’s 3-27 with the ball in the side’s last outing meant she was always going to be an instant selection for us for today’s encounter. The player has snared wickets at regular intervals to be a key component of the team making massive strides in the league, to see her become a regulation pick for the day.</p>
                              <p>Amelia Kerr will be accompanying her whilst from the other side we are venturing in with Samantha Bates after her astute spell yesterday. Her articulate line and length and willingness to pitch the ball in the right channel and throw it in air to lure the batswomen saw her make things extremely treacherous for the opposition yesterday. Rene Farrell will be coming in as well from the side to wrap up our Dream 11 unit of the day. <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-162"/><anchor name="div-gpt-ad-thesportsrush_com-leader-1-0"/></p>
                              <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                              <p>Little questions in going ahead with Mooney as our side’s captain for the encounter while from the same side we are opting for Jonassen as the vice-captain.</p>
