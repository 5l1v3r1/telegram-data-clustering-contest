      <p>An out-of-this-world meteor shower will dazzle earthlings over the weekend — and here’s how to catch a glimpse.</p>
      <p>It’s best to look up at the sky on Saturday night into early Sunday, when the Leonid meteor shower peaks and is most visible, <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/space-news/the-best-meteor-shower-of-the-month-to-peak-this-weekend/627314">according to AccuWeather</a>.</p>
      <p>Find a dark area — preferably away from city lights — and face away from the moon to see as many as 20 meteors per hour, according to experts.</p>
      <p>“Twenty meteors per hour are likely through the peak, which makes it more active than the recent Taurid meteor shower,” said AccuWeather Astronomy Blogger Dave Samuhel.</p>
      <p>The shower, which is expected to be “the best of the month,” is dubbed the Leonids because it comes from the constellation Leo.</p>
