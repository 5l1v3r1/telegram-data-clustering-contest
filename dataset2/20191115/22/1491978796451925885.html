        <i>• Four-times winners roar back to win Pool 5 match 25-20 <br/>• Simpson’s two tries had given Gloucester a first-half lead</i>
      </p>
      <p>Two tries by the scrum-half Joe Simpson could not prevent Gloucester losing 25-20 to Toulouse in their opening Pool 5 match of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/european-rugby-champions-cup">Champions Cup</a>.</p>
      <p>Simpson’s efforts, both in the first half, took the wind out of Toulouse’s sails and they trailed 20-9 at half-time. But the four-time winners went on to dominate the second half at Kingsholm, scoring 16 unanswered points.</p>
      <p>Sébastien Bézy secured the crucial touchdown which Thomas Ramos converted to put his side into the lead for the first time. Mark Atkinson was then penalised for a late tackle and Ramos knocked over the resulting kick to complete Toulouse’s comeback.</p>
      <p>Danny Cipriani had converted Simpson’s tries and kicked two penalties to complete the scoring for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gloucesterrugby">Gloucester</a>.</p>
      <p>“We defended well in the first quarter and Joe’s two great finishes gave the boys a good lift,” said Gloucester’s head coach, Johan Ackermann. “We missed a couple of chances to score just before half-time but after that our lineout was horrendous and they had over 70 per cent in terms of territory and possession. We therefore had no platform to attack from.</p>
      <p>“I’m very proud of the boys’ effort but I’m disappointed that we gave them some easy points in the second half.”</p>
