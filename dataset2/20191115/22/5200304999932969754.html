The web-series started the trend of original soundtracks in the Indian OTT space and went on to strike the right chord with audiences owing to its chartbusters that raked in millions of views on YouTube.

      <p>On the upcoming second season of the acclaimed web-series, Ekta Kapoor, Joint MD, Balaji Telefilms said, “When I make shows, I express it from my heart! Some emotions can’t be vocalized but they can only be experienced from the heart. Not every story has a happy ending, but life goes on and we too need to pick up the pieces and move on to heal. And when you break up with someone, a part of the process of moving on and leaving your baggage behind is also discovering yourself! This is what Season 2 of Broken…but Beautiful depicts.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on the music and trailer launch, Aparna Acharekar, Programming Head, ZEE5 India said, “It has been a fantastic year for us at ZEE5. Our association with AltBalaji has been successful right from the start of our relationship. There has been a great deal of exchange, brainstorming and learning. It is inspiring to partner with likeminded creative platforms. At this juncture, we are truly excited to premiere Broken… but Beautiful Season 2 and we hope audiences enjoy the series and the music as well.”</p>
      <p>The acclaimed actor Vikrant Massey, portraying the character of Veer, shared, “Seeing the adulation and accolades that the first season garnered, I am absolutely delighted that the excitement ahead of the show’s release is at an all-time high. Shooting for season 2 was an absolute joy to reunite with the amazing cast and crew. I have given the show my all and I am extremely happy with the way the story has panned out. I hope audiences love what we have in store and enjoy it to their heart’s content.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about her lead role of Sameera, Harleen Sethi quipped, “I was an almost newcomer before the first season, so expectations were minimal. But with the show reaching unprecedented heights, audiences now expect my character Sameera to deliver a power-packed performance. Shooting with such expectations was surely challenging, but that’s what brought out the best in me I guess. With Season 2, audiences are in for an emotional roller coaster ride that they’re going to remember for a very long time.”</p>
      <p>The first season of the web-series received immense popularity, unprecedented subscription numbers and love from the audience as well as renowned Bollywood personalities Like Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Sonali Bendre, Hrithik Roshan, Karan Johar, Riteish Deshmukh and many more.
