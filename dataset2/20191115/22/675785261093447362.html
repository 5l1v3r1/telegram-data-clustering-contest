      <h1>Brit and American girlfriend who met on Tik Tok married after fifth date proposal</h1>
      <h2>Sarah, 27, and Daniel Hancock, 26, began dating after meeting on the social media app last July and tied the knot in a whirlwind Las Vegas ceremony</h2>

      <p>A Brit and his American girlfriend have become the fist coupe to get married after meeting on social media app TikTok.</p>
      <p>Sarah, 27, and Daniel Hancock, 26, began dating after meeting on the TikTok last July.</p>
      <p>The lovestruck pair tied the knot in a whirlwind Las Vegas ceremony just eight months after meeting each other through the musical meme app - which allows users to create and share short videos with special effects.</p>
      <p>After the pair began following each other, Sarah invited her new social media pal to take part in a duet of Ed Sheeran's Shape of You.</p>
      <p>Just minutes after performing, the pair messaged one another via private message before moving across platforms to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to communicate.</p>
      <p>Within two weeks of  speaking Sarah booked tickets from Boston, US, to London Heathrow to see her crush.</p>

      <p>The pair continued to talk every day and would take it in turns to visit each other for the next eight months.</p>
      <p>After just five meetings, Dan decided to pop to the question to Sarah, filming his proposal for his TikTok followers at Castle Island, Boston, US.</p>
      <p>The pair had four weeks to plan their wedding, spending a humble £2,000 on venue hire, a wedding dress and their flights to Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>As a nod to how they first met, the couple danced to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> for their first dance as a married couple.</p>
      <p>The happy-couple then spent the next eleven days touring LA, Chicago and Boston as an immediate honeymoon.</p>
      <p>Dan said: "I remember walking down the street on one of our visits and I turned to Sarah said 'You know, I'm going to marry you some day'.</p>
      <p>"It was a joke but the more I thought about it when I was away from her, the more I realised I meant it."</p>
      <p>After first  flying to the UK, Sarah extended her stay by an extra four days after "falling head over heels in love" with the 26-year-old from Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset.</p>
      <p>Over the next six months the pair wracked up four trips to and fro the Atlantic before Daniel proposed at Castle Island, Boston, US on in March.</p>
      <p>The next time the pair met was four weeks later at their wedding in Las Vegas, where they walked down the isle at a Las Vegas chapel to officially become man and wife.</p>
      <p>Three months later Sarah is waiting for her permanent visa.</p>
      <p>Sarah said: "I just found him incredibly funny and thought to myself 'I have got to meet this guy'.</p>

      <p>"Something just seemed to click.</p>
      <p>"We were bonding over the songs we liked to sing to and the kind of movies we liked.</p>
      <p>"We did a tonne of other duets together on the app.</p>
      <p>"We did a Jonas Brothers duet, scenes from Bruce Almighty as that's one of Dan's favourite films and even did Frank Sinitra's 'New York' when we were there.</p>
      <p>"And if we weren't doing that we were just chatting away to one another."</p>
      <p>Daniel added: "I'm into music and I downloaded the app when it was  <a href="http://music.ly/">music.ly</a></p>
      <p>"That was a good few years ago. Then for some reason I had this urge to download it again and go back on it.</p>
      <p>"I'm so grateful I did otherwise I may never have met Sarah.</p>
      <p>"She popped up as a suggestion.</p>

      <p>"I checked out her profile and I found her videos really silly and funny.</p>
      <p>"I saw that she had over a thousand followers.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I thought she was attractive but there was nothing untoward when I followed her account.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't believe someone that cool wanted to follow me back."</p>
      <p>After speaking every day for the next two weeks, a love-struck Sarah booked a flight to London Heathrow where the pair spent eleven days visiting tourist sites.</p>
      <p>Daniel said: "When I saw her in the flesh it just felt incredible.</p>
      <p>"I'm glad she actually came and didn't turn out to be a middle-aged man or something."</p>
      <p>Sarah said: "The app is usually associated with kids mucking around and people sharing funny videos.</p>
      <p>"We've both used Tinder and dating apps before.</p>
      <p>"But we both used this app innocently.</p>
      <p>"We were on it to just have fun and mix with people who shared the same love of music and goofing around.</p>
      <p>"But we managed to find the loves of our lives.</p>
