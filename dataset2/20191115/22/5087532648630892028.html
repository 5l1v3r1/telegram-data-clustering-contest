      <h1>This 1,300mAh Portable Charger Fits on Your Keyring: $34</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/bryan-chaffin/" target="_blank">Bryan Chaffin</a></address>
      <p>We have a deal on a neat portable charger designed to fit on your keyring. It has a 1,300mAh capacity and an integrated, retractable Lightning port for when you need that quick, emergency charge. It’s $39.99 through our deal, but coupon code BFSAVE15 at checkout brings the price down to $34. I’m linking to the Lightning model, as described, but there are also USB-C and micro USB options in the deal listing, and that coupon code works on them, too.</p>
