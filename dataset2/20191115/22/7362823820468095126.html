      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jon-gosselin-furious-ex-kate-kids-film-kate-plus-8-against-judge-ruling">Jon Gosselin</a> has revealed just how much his high-profile divorce from his ex-wife, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kate-gosselin-marriage-kate-plus-date-show">Kate Gosselin</a>, cost him.</p>
      <p>The former "Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8" star spoke with <a href="https://people.com/tv/jon-gosselin-split-kate-gosselin-bankrupted-myself/">Dr. Oz in a clip obtained by People magazine</a>, alleging that TLC financially aided Kate, 44, during the divorce while he supported himself.</p>

      <p>“I literally hung a sign on my gate saying, ‘If any <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/reality">crew members</a> show up, I’ll have you arrested for trespassing,’” Jon, 42, said.</p>
      <p>“They sued me for breach of contract and I pretty much bankrupted myself, but I did it for moral reasons, obviously," he claimed.</p>

      <p>Jon claimed that when they split in 2009, Kate also sought “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">legal custody to film my kids</a> to sustain her lifestyle and their lifestyle,” which is why the network chipped in for legal fees.</p>
      <p>The two share eight children together, a pair of 18-year-old twins, and 15-year-old sextuplets. Two of the sextuplets live with Jon, but he has no contact with any of the other children.</p>

      <p>"I believe (Kate's) intentions, in the beginning, were good intentions, bringing kids into the world,” said Jon. “She fought to have these kids. But I think once fame and money got involved, it twisted her belief system. On my end, I’ve been fighting to get my kids off TV forever.”</p>
      <p>Reps for TLC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment</p>
