      <p>Sheriff Alex Villanueva said as of Friday the suspect remains in critical condition. One of the victims has been released from the hospital, and two are expected to be released in the next few days.</p>
      <p>After conducting more than 40 interviews, police found no manifesto or writing regarding the shooting by the suspect, but they do believe it was a planned attack. When the suspect’s mother dropped him off at school, he had the pistol and a planned number of shots in his bag.</p>
