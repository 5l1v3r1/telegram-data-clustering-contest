      <p>TORONTO — Don't expect an immediate replacement for fired commentator Don Cherry on "Coach's Corner."</p>
      <p>In fact, it's possible that Sportsnet may eventually take the long-running "Hockey Night in Canada" segment in a different direction.</p>
      <p>"We're taking the time to explore new formats for the first intermission," Sportsnet communications director Andrew Garas said in an email to The Canadian Press late Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Garas also confirmed that Saturday night's first intermission will highlight the 2019 Hockey Hall of Fame inductees. The induction ceremony is Monday.</p>
      <p>Cherry's nearly four-decade run on Hockey Night ended this past Monday. He made on-air comments last Saturday night which many felt were critical of immigrants for not wearing Remembrance Day poppies.</p>
      <p>Segment co-host Ron MacLean, who apologized last weekend, said this week he intends to address the matter on Saturday. MacLean did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.</p>
      <p>HNIC was a longtime CBC Saturday night staple, but the show and its games moved to Sportsnet when Rogers landed a lucrative long-term broadcast rights deal with the NHL that began in 2014. "Coach's Corner'' and HNIC are still broadcast on CBC in a sub-licensing deal with Rogers Media, which owns Sportsnet.</p>
      <p>Cherry's departure sparked much discussion among hockey fans about what the future of the popular segment might hold. </p>
      <p>The 85-year-old native of Kingston, Ont., joined HNIC in 1980 as a playoff analyst and was so popular that he was kept on as a colour commentator. CBC later created "Coach's Corner'' as a vehicle to showcase Cherry with MacLean eventually replacing Dave Hodge as his sidekick.</p>
      <p>Several candidates would be qualified to replace Cherry if Sportsnet elects to stay with the current format. </p>
      <p>Former hockey executive and current Sportsnet analyst Brian Burke is listed as the early betting favourite (+125), according to odds released this week by sportsbook Bodog.</p>
      <p>Odds were also available for Sportsnet broadcasters Elliotte Friedman (+175), Colby Armstrong (+650), Craig Simpson (+650), Kelly Hrudey (+650) and Chris Johnston (+900).</p>
