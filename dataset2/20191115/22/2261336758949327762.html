      <h1>UFC heavyweight champ Stipe Miocic to Tyson Fury: ‘Let’s dance’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Heavyweight kings Stipe Miocic and Tyson Fury continue to tease of a showdown in the boxing ring, with Miocic recently tweeting ‘let’s dance’ in response to ‘The Gypsy King’s’ call for a <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/13/20963760/tyson-fury-crossover-boxing-fight-ufc-champ-stipe-miocic-mma-news">crossover boxing match</a> after his rematch with Deontay Wilder.</p>
      <p>“Stipe says he wants to box me; that would be a good fight for sure. After I get Wilder out of the way, I’ll fight Stipe in a boxing match if he wants it. It would be a big crossover fight like Mayweather and McGregor. I’m open to that fight, so he should come and see me. It would be the same outcome for any of them: They’ll all get smashed,” Fury said.</p>

      <p>“Let’s dance,” Miocic tweeted in response to Fury.</p>
      <p>Although there’s mutual interest in a boxing match, Fury recently hinted that he could one day make the crossover to MMA, as recent <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956119/video-tyson-fury-train-darren-till-move-mma-dana-white-attention-ufc-news-boxing">video footage</a> showed the 31-year-old learning the basics with UFC middleweight contender Darren Till at Team Kaobon gym in Liverpool, England.</p>
      <p>With Fury set for a rematch with Wilder, Miocic has his hands full with former two-division champ Daniel Cormier, who Miocic knocked out earlier this year at UFC 241 to even the score 1-1. Both men are expected to collide in a heavyweight trilogy bout next year, although no date or venue has been announced.</p>
