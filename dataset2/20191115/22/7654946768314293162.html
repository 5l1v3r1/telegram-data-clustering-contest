      <h1>James Holzhauer wins ‘Jeopardy!’ Tournament of Champions in nail-biting game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:32:55+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:32</time> by <a rel="author">Hana R. Alberts</a></address>
      <p>James Holzhauer got the last laugh.</p>
      <p>The “Jeopardy” whiz, who won 32 regular games in a row over the summer, took home the $250,00 grand price in the storied game show’s Tournament of Champions Friday night — besting the contestant who ended his streak in the process.</p>
      <p>Over the two-night final, Holzhauer — a 35-year-old <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/25/jeopardy-champ-james-holzhauer-finishes-out-of-money-at-world-series-of-poker-debut/">professional gambler from Las Vegas</a> — faced off against Emma Boettcher, a 27-year-old librarian from Chicago <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/03/who-is-new-jeopardy-champ-emma-boettcher/">who beat him on June 3</a>, and Francois Barcomb, a 50-year-old physics teacher from New Paltz, NY, who won the Teachers’ Tournament.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, at the end of the first half of the Tournament of Champions final, Holzhauer led with $49,326, while Boettcher trailed with $26,400 and Barcomb tallied $1,800.</p>
      <p>But in the tense and exciting faceoff Friday night, Boettcher lead the field going into final Jeopardy, with $21,600 to Holzhauer’s $17,785 and Barcomb’s $1,600. All three contestants got the Final Jeopardy clue correct, and Boettcher was the victor of night 2 with $38,600. Holzahuer ended night 2 with $27,597 and Barcomb with $3,200. But when Thursday night’s totals were added in, Holzhauer emerged victorious: His podium read $76,923, while Boettcher’s flashed $65,000 and Barcomb’s $5,000.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer winnings now total $2,712,216. He has earned the third-highest total in “Jeopardy!” history, trailing only Ken Jennings’ $3,370,700 (over a record 74 straight regular-season victories plus tournaments) and Brad Rutter’s $4,688,436.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer, who has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/james-holzhauer-one-win-away-from-jeopardy-tournament-of-champions-title/">talked jokingly about “payback”</a> in promotional videos posted on Twitter, complimented his foe on her performance in the finals.</p>

      <p>“I’ve said all along that Emma is an all-time great player, and I’m proud it took that level of competitor to defeat me,” Holzhauer said in a statement. “Now the world sees that I wasn’t just making excuses. Francois certainly looked as dominant as either of us in his first two games, so I knew the finals would be a fight to the finish. But the whole point of the TOC is to play the best of the best, and Emma and Francois certainly proved that they belonged in the final three.”</p>
      <p>In the Tournament of Champions, Boettcher nabbed the second-place pot, $100,000, essentially doubling her regular-season earnings, and Barcomb left the stage with an additional $50,000 in his wallet.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer has donated to various charitable causes with his regular-season winnings and continues to work as a sports gambler. In 2012, Holzhauer, 35, married Melissa Sassin; together, they have a 5-year-old daughter, Natasha, whom he often references in ways explicit (once showing the audience a card she drew) and subtle (using a variation of her birthdate as a wager).</p>
