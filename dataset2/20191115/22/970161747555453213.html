      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a>’s very unfortunate sleeping habit could cause havoc for his<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">…Get Me Out Of Here!</a> campmates.</p>
      <p>The ex-footballer has admitted that he has a rather bad habit of sleepwalking…and will probably need another contestant to help back into bed.</p>
      <p>We can see that going down very well with a group of hungry and sleep-deprived celebrities, can’t you?</p>
      <p>‘If I do sleepwalk and they direct me back to the bed, that’s what my mum used to do as a kid,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘Dennis Bergkamp used to turn me back around towards my bed, all I need is someone to turn me back around towards the bed.</p>
      <p>‘Let’s hope that somebody is looking out for me. I haven’t sleptwalk in a while but this is a different environment isn’t it. Hopefully it’ll happen and we can all have a laugh.’</p>

      <p>Luckily, Ian will have a whole host of campmates to call upon should a sleepwalking emergency arise.</p>

      <p>He’s joining a veritable star-studded line-up, including reality TV icon Caitlyn Jenner, EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa and Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>It also feels like the former footballer might be a bit of a problem in the camp, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/im-a-celebrity-ian-wrights-mum-warns-bushtucker-trials-could-give-ex-footballer-an-asthma-attack-11136609/">as his mother has previously revealed she’s worried that the bushtucker trails could trigger a deadly asthma attack</a> for her son.</p>
      <p>Time to wrap him up in cotton wool we think?</p>
      <p>Nesta Wright, 90, said: ‘When he was a kid he suffered really badly with asthma, he doesn’t have it now as an adult but going in those small places with water dripping – it’s scary.’</p>
      <p>All we’re saying is – make sure you have medic Bob on standby at all times!</p>
      <p>There’s also been some obligatory drama before the new series has even started – with Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp embroiled in a social media scandal.</p>
      <p>The son of Spandau Ballet’s Martin Kemp<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/roman-kemp-apologises-abusive-social-media-posts-ahead-im-celeb-stint-im-utterly-sorry-11069831/"> had to apologise for previous ‘offensive’ material across his old accounts</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram story recently, he shared a video with his 204,000 followers, explaining: ‘I wanted to talk about something I’ve seen a lot of celebrities talking about, and people around the world talking about, and that is the use of language online.’</p>

      <p>‘Being totally honest, I’m shocked and appalled and ashamed to say I did find things,’ he continued. ‘I did find things I’m not at all proud of. I don’t associate myself with that. I know the person who wrote those things is not the man I am now, but they were there.’</p>
