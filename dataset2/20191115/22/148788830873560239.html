      <h1>Nicolas Cage Will Play Nicolas Cage in a Movie About Nicolas Cage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:30:15+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p><b>Nicolas Cage</b>, wonderful actor and Prince of Memes, might be about to ascend to another plane of existence. Because Nicolas Cage is in talks to play Nicolas Cage in a movie about – wait for it – Nicolas Cage. The film is <b><i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i></b>, and Cage would play a fictionalized version of himself having to reckon with his career choices while <i>also</i> getting mixed up in a plot involving the CIA and a drug cartel kingpin.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I worry we take Nicolas Cage for granted. That our collective joy at watching him go completely off the rails has lead him down a strange path, one where he gets pigeonholed into weird, goofy nonsense. At the same time, it <i>really</i> seems like Cage gives all of his roles his full attention. Sure, he has a mountain of debt to pay-off, but damn it, he’s not going to half-ass his work.</p>
      <p>Cage’s entire career seems to have been building towards this very moment: <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626">THR</a> says he’s in talks to play himself in <i>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i><i>, </i>a film that Lionsgate beat out HBO Max and Paramount to make. The plot sounds…wild, y’all. In the film, Nicolas Cage is desperate to land a role in a new Quentin Tarantino movie.  He’s also “dealing with a strained relationship with his teenage daughter. He also occasionally talks to an egotistical 1990s version of himself who rides him for making too many crappy movies and for not being a star anymore.”</p>
      <p>Much like the real Cage, this movie Cage is “under a mountain of debt.” These debts force Cage to “make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican billionaire who happens to be a fan of Cage’s work and secretly hopes to show him a script on which he’s been working.”</p>
      <p>This is already pretty strange, but here’s where things get really far-out:</p>
      <blockquote>While he bonds with the man, Cage is informed by the CIA that the billionaire is actually a drug cartel kingpin who has kidnapped the daughter of a Mexican presidential nominee, and is recruited by the U.S. government to get intelligence. The situation spirals even more dramatically when the Mexican brings over Cage’s daughter and his ex-wife for a reconciliation, and when their lives are on the line, Cage takes on the role of a lifetime.</blockquote>
      <p>If all of that wasn’t enough to hook you, you should also know that the film references real Cage movies like<i> Leaving Las Vegas</i>, <i>Face-Off</i>, and<i> Gone in 60 Seconds</i>, and that the script that Cage and the alleged drug kingpin are writing “begins to mirror events on the storyline.”</p>
      <p>The script comes from <b>Tom Gormican</b> and<b> Kevin Etten</b>, and Gormican is attached to direct. Sources tell THR that Gormican wrote a letter to Cage stating that the script “was a love letter to the actor, not something that made fun of him.” And Cage apparently agreed, and that’s why he’s now in talks.</p>
      <p>I am dying to see this, and I’m sure you do, too – how can you not want to watch Nic Cage play himself?</p>
