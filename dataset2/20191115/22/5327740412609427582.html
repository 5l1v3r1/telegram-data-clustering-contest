      <p>A Vancouver police officer has been charged with sexual assault in connection to an incident in Whistler this past summer.</p>
      <p>Squamish RCMP announced the charge against Jagraj Roger Berar, 51, in a news release Friday. Police received a complaint on July 19 about an alleged assault a few days prior, sparking an investigation.</p>
      <p>During the course of the probe, RCMP said it was learned Berar, who lives in Surrey, was a serving member of the Vancouver Police Department. Investigators believe the incident was isolated and involved two people who know each other.</p>
      <p>“Police do not believe the allegations are related to his employment as a police officer,” Squamish RCMP said.</p>
      <p>In a emailed statement to Black Press Media on Friday, Vancouver police spokesperson Sgt. Steve Addison confirmed that Berar is employed by the police department but is not on active duty.</p>
