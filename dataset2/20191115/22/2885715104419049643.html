      <p>WINTER MAY have set in across Maharashtra but Pune and its neighbouring areas may have to wait slightly longer to feel the chill. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the moisture levels were high at present and the city might experience light rain in the form of drizzle during the weekend.</p>
      <p>“As a result, both day and night temperatures will remain slightly above normal in Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan regions till next week. The skies will mostly remain overcast during the day and the night temperatures are expected to hover around 15 degrees Celsius, while the day temperatures could remain around 30 degrees Celsius,” said a senior official from the IMD, Pune, on Friday.</p>
      <p>However, the mercury has recorded a drop in Marathwada and Vidarbha sub-divisions. Here, the day temperatures have remained below 30 degrees Celsius, making the days colder than normal.</p>
      <p>“The night temperatures in Vidarbha and Marathwada will drop in the coming days. Some cities in Marathwada recorded a drop by three notches in the minimum temperatures,” the official added.</p>
      <p>Recording 14.5 degrees Celsius, Nagpur remained the coldest city on Friday followed by Aurangabad, Osmanabad and Washim at 14.8 degrees Celsius, Akola at 15 degrees Celsius and Mahabaleshwar at 15.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
