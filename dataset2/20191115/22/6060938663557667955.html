      <p>MUMBAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebi">Sebi</a> on Friday asked brokers to link the unique client code (UCC) of investors to the latter’s demat accounts. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/UCC">UCC</a> is a number that is assigned to each investor and is “unique” in nature.</p>
      <p>Sebi also directed exchanges and depositories to put in place a mechanism to map each UCC with one or more demat accounts. The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sebi-direction">Sebi direction</a> is aimed at detecting and preventing brokers from illegally diverting securities of investors to make a fast buck. Every investor with a broking house is assigned a UCC. However, the same individual will have a different UCC when he opens an account with another broker.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Sebi had initiated an early warning mechanism to detect instances of diversion of client’s securities by the stock broker at an early stage to take appropriate preventive measures. As a continuation of the process, after discussions with stock exchanges and depositories, Sebi said that while brokers will map each UCC with one or more demat accounts, bourses will share data like PAN, trading segment of the investor, if the broker is a trading or a clearing member, etc linked to each UCC. Subsequently, depositories will map each <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pan-card">PAN</a> with the UCC.</p>
      <p>“Stock exchanges and depositories shall have a mechanism in place to ensure that inactive, non-operational UCCs are not misused and also a system to ensure that inactive, non-operational UCCs are weeded out in the process of mapping clients’ UCC with their demat account,” a Sebi circular said.</p>
      <p>Stock exchanges and depositories should share data by November 30 and the complete process to link UCC with PAN and other data should be in place by December 31, Sebi said. After the initial phase, the process will have to continue as an ongoing practice.</p>
