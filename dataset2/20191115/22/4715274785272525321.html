      <h1>Makati allots P18 billion for 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:10:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Joel E. Zurbano</a></address>
      <p>The city government of Makati has allocated more than P8 billion for its social development program next year, Mayor Abigail Binay said Friday.</p>
      <p>Health, education and social welfare programs will get the biggest chunk from the P18- billion budget in 2020, which was signed by the city chief executive hours after members of the City Council approved the measure on third and final reading on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Binay, who had certified the budget’s approval as urgent, said the 2020 budget reflected the priority thrusts and policies of her administration. </p>
      <p>The programs and services under the Social Development Sector got the biggest allocation of about P8.07 billion or 44.7 percent of the total budget of P18,047,460,000.</p>
      <p>Based on the approved 2020 budget of the city, Health got the biggest share of the total budget among the social sub-sectors, with P5.26 billion (29.17 percent), followed by Education with P1.43 billion (7.93 percent), and Social Welfare with P1.37 billion (7.59 percent).</p>
      <p>“Our overarching goal is to provide citizens with fast and free access to quality health care, education, and social services which are indispensable to their overall development,” Binay said.</p>
      <p>Binay said the city government had adhered to its ‘people first’ principle amid efforts to accelerate the city’s digital transformation through embracing modern technology. She cited public-private partnerships as an effective strategy to make progress with the city’s vision without compromising the city’s financial capacity to sustain priority programs. </p>
      <p>“We have purposely teamed up with industry leaders in the private sector to implement digital initiatives without incurring added costs on the city coffers. The PPP strategy has allowed us to continue making substantial investments in social programs and services that enable Makatizens to reach their full potential and become not only self-reliant members of society but empowered partners in nation-building,” said Binay.</p>
      <p>The mayor thanked the City Council, led by Vice Mayor Monique Lagdameo, for approving the 2020 executive budget through City Ordinance 2019-A-110. </p>
      <p>“The prompt approval of the budget has ensured that our beloved Makatizens will continue to receive timely and adequate services from the city in 2020. We are also optimistic about meeting our timelines for the implementation of new and continuing programs and projects,” Mayor Binay said.</p>
      <p>Prior to the enactment of the appropriations ordinance, the Sangguniang Panlungsod through its Committee on Laws, Rules and Ethics and Committee on Appropriations and Budget had conducted a series of meetings for the Joint Committee Deliberation/Review of the proposed budget of each of the 36 city departments and offices from Oct. 28 to Nov. 5 at city hall.</p>
