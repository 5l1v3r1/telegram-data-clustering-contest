      <h1>Frank Miller's SIN CITY is Being Developed as a TV Series with Robert Rodriguez in Talk To Join The Project</h1>

      <p>Legendary Television has closed a deal with <b>Frank Miller </b>to adapt his comic book series <b><i>Sin City</i></b> into a TV show.<b> Robert Rodriguez</b>, who directed the two <i>Sin City </i>feature films is in talks to join the project as well.</p>
      <p>Miller and Rodriguez are expected to executive produce the series, which has been guaranteed at least one season. The deal with Miller also calls for a hard-R animated series for a <i>Sin City</i> prequel based on the comics. The plan is to set these shows up with a network or streaming service.</p>
      <p>I love what Rodriguez and Miller did with the films and it’s pretty cool that they will be teaming up again for this series. There’s no word on if they will direct any episodes, but I assume that they will.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see if the series will implement the same visual style for the films or if they will try something new and different in telling the neo-noir stories that Miller wrote. Those stories are set in Basin City and involved a cast of interesting recurring characters that intertwined with each other.</p>
      <p>What would you like to see from a<i> Sin City</i> series?</p>
