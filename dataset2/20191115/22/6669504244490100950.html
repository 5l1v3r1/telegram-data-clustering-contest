      <p>RCMP are asking for the public's help to find a missing 14-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Trinity Erickson was last seen in her Kelowna home just before 9 p.m. yesterday, Nov. 14, according to an RCMP media release.</p>
      <p>Police say foul play is not suspected and she is believed to be in the Kelowna area. Family told police it’s out of character for her to be out of contact for this long.</p>
      <p>Erickson is decribed as an Inigenous female, 5'5" tall, 150 lbs. with long dyed blonde hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing pyjamas but it’s presumed that she has changed her clothing.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can contact their local police, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.</p>
