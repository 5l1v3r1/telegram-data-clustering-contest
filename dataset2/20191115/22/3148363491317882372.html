      <p>During an interview with CNN on Friday, House Democratic Chief Deputy Whip Dan Kildee (D-MI) said it’s “very possible” that House Democrats will include witness intimidation in articles of impeachment if articles of impeachment are filed.</p>
      <p>Host Jake Tapper asked, “Do you think that House Democrats will, potentially, include witness intimidation in the articles of impeachment, should they be filed, based on what happened today?”</p>
      <p>Kildee answered, “I think it’s very possible. The president clearly is engaged in a number of activities to try to obstruct this investigation, including, now, potentially intimidating a witness.”</p>
