      <h1>Exclusive: Joe Gomez left devastated by Wembley boos as Gareth Southgate seeks out defender and his family after game to offer support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:31:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Law, Football News Correspondent , Sam Wallace, Chief Football Writer</a></address>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate sought out devastated Joe Gomez and his family late on Thursday night to offer further support after he was booed by Wembley fans in the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>And <i>Telegraph Sport</i> understands that team-mates of Gomez believed he was first jeered when he was warming up on the Wembley touchline as a substitute, before the loud boos echoed around the stadium when he was sent on in the 70th minute.</p>
      <p>Gomez and his team-mates were <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/14/booed-came-wrong-raheem-sterling-condemns-fans-turned-joe/">left stunned and angry</a> by the reaction of the crowd in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/england-teammates-raheem-sterling-joe-gomez-came-blows-steps/">aftermath of the attack by Raheem Sterling</a> that meant the Manchester City star sat out <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/14/england-vs-montenegro-euro-2020-qualifier-live-score-latest/">England’s 1000th game.</a></p>
      <p>Southgate publicly backed Gomez and condemned the booing immediately after the match that clinched England’s qualification, but felt it necessary to spend more time with the player after completing his media duties to check on the 22-year-old’s well-being and reiterate his backing.</p>
      <p>England coach Chris Powell, who has known Gomez since his days as a youngster at Charlton Athletic, also spent time with the Liverpool defender after the game as the squad and coaching staff rallied around him.</p>

      <p>Gomez was booed on to the pitch by England supporters, when he was introduced as a second-half substitute, to cap what has been an incredibly difficult week after he was attacked by team-mate Sterling.</p>
      <p>There had been some suggestions that the booing could also have been for Sterling. But it is understood that pockets of booing had already been heard when Gomez was warming up, which outraged his fellow substitutes at the time.</p>
      <p>Southgate, England’s players and Football Association staff have been hugely impressed by the way Gomez put the country’s interests over his own in dealing with the incident.</p>
      <p>The full facts of what happened at St George’s Park have been kept private by Gomez, who still has a scratch under his eye, and Sterling has apologised after being punished with a one-game ban.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old’s fiance Tamara was inside Wembley to witness the booing with their baby son Kyrie, who had been taken to his first England game.</p>
      <p>Other members of his family and friends were also present and they waited for Gomez, who was said to be incredibly low and confused over why he had been scapegoated.</p>
      <p>Sterling took to Twitter to reiterate that Gomez had done nothing wrong and that he should not have been booed, a message backed by captain Harry Kane.</p>
      <p>England’s players would now like Southgate to start both Gomez and Sterling against Kosovo on Sunday in what has become a dead-rubber in terms of Euro 2020 qualification.</p>
      <p>Southgate has already promised Sterling will make an immediate return to his team after serving his ban and England players now believe the ultimate show of unity would be for Gomez to start in the same team as him.</p>
      <p>Gomez will continue to receive the support of Southgate, his coaching staff and his England team-mates over the course of the next 48 hours in the build up to the Kosovo clash.</p>
      <p>Kane spoke with Gomez in the Wembley dressing-room after the Montenegro game and has revealed the part he played, as captain, in trying to keep the peace after Sterling’s attack.</p>
      <p>“I was not  in the room when it happened,” explained Kane. “So after it happened I asked him and a few of the players about what went on. I then spoke to Joe privately about how he was feeling. Emotions had run high just after it happened so I spoke to Raz and me and a few of the senior players spoke about what we should do.</p>
      <p>“Joe and Raz then got together and had a chat and then after that, I spoke to Joe again to see how he was feeling. He was feeling better after his chat with Raz. We had a private meeting and I won’t discuss what we said. It is about understanding what went on and why, speaking to both players and trying to control it. I think we all handled it as well as we could have.”</p>
      <p>Having seen Gomez booed at Wembley, Kane is hoping England supporters do not let their club allegiances and rivalries spill on to the international scene.</p>
      <p>“I find it really confusing why he was booed,” said Kane. “I cannot quite figure it out. But I don’t think any player should be booed. I know how important club football is with City and Liverpool, and all clubs. But at international level, we are all England fans and the bottom line is that Joe is a great guy - one of the nicest guys I have ever met. He is a top professional and for him it is about moving on, training and looking at the next game.”</p>
      <p>Despite still having to deal with the fall-out from Sterling’s clash with Gomez and the subsequent punishment and reaction, Southgate has rejected any suggestion his squad is split over the issue.</p>
      <p>“The whole dressing room are together,” said Southgate. “I did try to say this yesterday. From the narrative that’s out there, you’d have thought that we were a camp that [was] in absolute disarray and that just isn’t the case.</p>
      <p>“I think the reaction that Raheem has given shows that they’re very, very close and we’re hugely disappointed for Joe [Gomez]. He doesn’t deserve that in any way, shape or form. I’ll repeat what I said earlier, no England player in an England shirt should be booed.”</p>
