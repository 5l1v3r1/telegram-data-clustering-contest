      <h1>‘Derry Girls’ And ‘Great British Bake Off’ Will Get A Cross-Over Episode, Because Life Is Good</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:54:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:54</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/should-you-bother-watching-derry-girls/190015"><i>Derry Girls</i> is a sweet, warm-hearted look at familial bonds and the power of friendship</a>. <i>The Great British Bake Off</i> is a sweet, warm-hearted look at what happens when you ask a lot of congenial people to bake tarts under a time pressure.</p>
      <p>So, sure, the two shows might have some cosmetic differences, but at their hearts, they have the same view of the world. True evil exists in the universe of neither program — these are shows filled with gentle understanding, not artificial attempts to raise the stakes.</p>
      <p>For those reasons, it makes perfect sense that the two shows will be mooshed together for one extraordinary cross-over episode, airing on New Year’s Day.</p>

      <p>Yep, the cast of <i>Derry Girls</i> will be the guests on a forthcoming special episode of <i>Great British Bake Off</i> — as themselves, unfortunately, rather than their characters.</p>
      <p>But hey, that’ll still leave a lot of room for all sorts of very British, very sweet shenanigans. Expect to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Fielding">Noel Fielding</a> bend himself in half with gentle laughter, someone burn a biscuit, someone else use some very odd euphemism for a curse word, and for the whole thing to have the warm fuzzy feeling of a hand-knitted blanket.</p>
