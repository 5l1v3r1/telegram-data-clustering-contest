      <p>Laurent Simons, of Belgium, started studying electrical engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology when he was 8 and will complete a three-year program in 10 months, The New York Times reported. His final project is an electrical chip that is connected to the brain.</p>
      <p>"Then, I want to study medicine and do a Ph.D. and make artificial organs," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/europe/laurent-simons-prodigy.html">he told The New York Times</a>.</p>
      <p>He was raised by his grandparents while his parents worked in the Netherlands. They are all doctors. He now lives with his parents.</p>
      <p>"His grandparents always taught us he's very special," <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/europe/laurent-simons-prodigy.html">father Alexander Simons told The Times</a>. "We thought they were taking him too seriously."</p>
      <p>Laurent, who has an IQ of 145, started school at 4 and was in high school at 6 years old. </p>
      <p>"Laurent is the fastest student we have ever had here," Sjoerd Hulshof, the director of education at the university, said in a statement, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/europe/university-graduate-child-genius-scli-intl/index.html">CNN reported</a>. "Not only is he hyper intelligent but also a very sympathetic boy."</p>
      <p>His instructors rave about his academic abilities.</p>
      <p>"Laurent's absorption capacity is very high, which means that everything goes much faster and we can cover a lot more material in a short span of time," <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/peter-baltus/">Peter Baltus</a>, a professor at the university and the boy's mentor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/world/europe/laurent-simons-prodigy.html">told the Times</a>. "It's been quite special and enjoyable."</p>
      <p>In his off-time, Laurent has interests similar to most kids, playing video games, posting on social media and watching Netflix. </p>

      <p>Ultimately, he would like to develop artificial hearts.</p>
      <p>"My goal as a scientist is life extension," <a href="https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/nog-nooit-vertoond-laurent-9-haalt-bachelor-aan-tu-eindhoven~ac6cc143/?referrer&amp;referrer=https://studio040.nl/nieuws/artikel/9-jarig-wonderkind-haalt-bachelor-aan-tue">he told AD, an online publication in the Netherlands</a>. "My grandfather and grandmother are heart patients and I want to help them."</p>
