      <h3>NVIDIA continues to make its comeback</h3>
      <p>Revenue and profit declined less than expected in NVIDIA's <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/15/nvidias-earnings-show-its-acing-the-comeback-game.aspx">third quarter</a>, but guidance for Q4 was softer than analysts were forecasting, and shares slid 2.7%. Revenue fell 5% to $3.01 billion, compared with the $2.91 billion analyst consensus. Non-<a href="https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/your-guide-to-gaap.aspx">GAAP</a> earnings per share slumped 3% to $1.78, but Wall Street had been braced for a 15% decline.</p>
      <p>The GPU specialist's gaming platform revenue was $1.66 billion, down 6% compared with a strong quarter a year ago, but up 26% sequentially in the highly seasonal business. Data center revenue of $726 million was down 8% year over year but up 11% from last quarter. Gross margin improved 3.2 percentage points from a year ago, helped by lower costs and higher selling prices for NVIDIA's gaming chips.</p>
      <p>Looking forward, the company highlighted <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/25/11-reasons-to-buy-nvidia-stock-and-never-sell.aspx">expectations for strong growth</a> in its data center segment, saying in the <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/11/14/nvidia-corp-nvda-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx">conference call</a> that use of artificial intelligence (AI) for voice recognition in a wide variety of industries is driving chip sales. But NVIDIA's guidance for Q4 revenue of $2.95 billion, while representing a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/15/3-important-revelations-from-nvidia-q3-earnings-r.aspx">return to growth</a>, was below the $3.06 billion analyst consensus.</p>
      <h3>Applied Materials sees signs of recovery in semiconductors</h3>
      <p>Applied Materials, maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, reported results for its fiscal Q4 that beat expectations and gave strong guidance for next quarter, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/15/why-applied-materials-stock-just-popped-9.aspx">propelling shares up 9%</a>. Net sales were roughly flat at $3.75 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share fell 6% to $0.80. Analysts were expecting the company to earn $0.76 per share on sales of $3.68 billion.</p>
      <p>What impressed Wall Street about the report were comments by the company about strengthening demand for semiconductor equipment and a strong outlook for the next quarter. Applied Materials expects Q1 revenue to be $4.1 billion compared with the analyst consensus of $3.74 billion. It forecast EPS between $0.72 and $0.80, compared with expectations of $0.74.</p>
      <p>Company leaders for the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/investing-in-tech-stocks.aspx">tech stock</a> bellwether said on the <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/11/14/applied-materials-inc-amat-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx">conference call</a> there has been a "healthy uptick" in demand for its products, and that they are seeing signs of recovery in the market for semiconductor memory, particularly in NAND. Increased spending for applications in AI, a recovery in cloud computing, and acceleration in 5G are contributing to higher investments in the industry.</p>
