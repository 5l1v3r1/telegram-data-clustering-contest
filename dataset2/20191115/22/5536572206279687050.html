      <p>Such sad news to hit the basketball community when it was announced that former North Carolina State and NBA player Anthony Grundy tragically lost his life on Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/11/15/anthony-grundy-nc-state-stabbing-death/4203033002/">USA Today</a>, Grundy died due to “multiple sharp force injuries to the body.” Grundy was said to be involved in a domestic dispute, and when police showed up at Grundy’s mother’s home, they found him on the street bleeding.</p>
      <p>Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley stated that investigators think Grundy was involved “in some type of altercation” at nearby apartments but were “uncertain specifically how he sustained that injury.”</p>
      <p>Archie Miller, a former teammate of Grundy reacted to the news on Twitter, writing, “So Tough to hear the news of the passing of one my Best Men. Thoughts and Prayers go out to everyone impacted. Take it way back with a couple of these. Absolute Warrior, one the most fearless I have ever been around.”</p>
