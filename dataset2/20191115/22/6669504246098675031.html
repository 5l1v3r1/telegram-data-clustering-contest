      <p>More than 100 affordable homes are coming to Kamloops for people with low to middle incomes.</p>
      <p>The province is partnering with the Centre for Seniors Information and Stoni Flats Developments to build homes at 630 Victoria St, according to a press release. The six-storey wood frame building will include a mix of studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments and include 12 two-bedroom homes that will be available to families.</p>
      <p>“People in Kamloops deserve to have an affordable home close to friends and family,” Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson says in the release. “That’s why we are working hard with our partners to build homes that seniors and families can afford in their own communities throughout the province.”</p>
      <p>The downtown location was chosen because of its proximity to transit and walking distance to many amenities for seniors. The society is receiving $11.2 million from the province’s building B.C.: Community Housing Fund as well as annual operating funding for the project.</p>
      <p>This project is part of more than 22,000 new homes that are completed or underway through B.C. because of provincial investments.</p>
      <p>“The City is proud to support this project which will provide affordable housing for seniors and families in our community. This project is in a great location and close to the many wonderful amenities downtown. We are pleased that valued senior members and families in our community will be offered an affordable place to call home,” Mayor of Kamloops Ken Christian says in the release.</p>
