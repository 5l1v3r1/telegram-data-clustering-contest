      <h3>People who live in and around the city will get a chance to learn about the proposed Saskatoon Freeway and offer their opinions later this month.</h3>
      <p>The province’s Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure will host information sessions in Saskatoon on Nov. 26 and Nov. 27. A news release on the sessions was posted to the Saskatoon Freeway website on Wednesday.</p>

        <b>FREEWAY FEEDBACK</b>
      </p>
      <p>The provincial Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure will host two information sessions on the Saskatoon Freeway.</p>
      <p>WHEN: Nov. 26 and Nov. 27</p>
      <p>TIME: 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>WHERE: Saskatoon Inn Courtyard Room (Nov. 26) and Henk Ruys Soccer Centre lounge (Nov. 27)</p>
      <p>The functional planning for the Saskatoon bypass, once known as the perimeter highway, is proceeding in three stages.</p>
      <p>The first phase is only looking at the northern portion of the proposed route, which has been determined to be the most difficult.</p>
      <p>The information sessions are also expected to offer information on the bridge that will cross the South Saskatchewan River, which will be located within a kilometre northeast of the Chief Mistawsis Bridge.</p>
      <p>In addition to the river crossing, the north stretch crosses Highways 11, 12 and 16 and would move the north connection to Highway 11 from its current location.</p>
      <p>Idylwyld Drive currently connects to Highway 11, which then veers east to head toward Prince Albert. The proposed realignment under the Saskatoon Freeway plan would move the Highway 11 connection east to Wanuskewin Road.</p>
      <p>This strategy would eliminate an intersection that is considered dangerous — Highway 11 and Wanuskewin — and space out the interchanges along the freeway.</p>
      <p>Those who attend the information sessions will get the chance to fill out a survey, the results of which will be included in a report on the first phase expected sometime next year.</p>
      <p>A public engagement survey is also posted on the project website at saskatoonfreeway.org.</p>
      <p>No final decision has been made on whether to build the freeway, which has been estimated to cost more than $2 billion.</p>
