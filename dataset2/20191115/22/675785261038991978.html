      <p>Harry Kane probably had a restless night following his exploits at Wembley … and not because he was reliving another England treble.</p>
      <p>The captain now has back-to-back Wembley hat-tricks, having claimed the match ball after the 4-0 win over Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>But he returned to squad base on Thursday night, believing he should have had more in the rout of Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Kane said: “I had a chance in the second half and the keeper saved it just before I came off.</p>
      <p>“That is the one I will probably think about more than anything.”</p>

      <p>While that gives an insight into Kane’s focus and perfectionism, the England skipper did accept this hat-trick - coming on the occasion of England’s 1000th game - was particularly significant.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was a special night and a big occasion for our nation.</p>
      <p>“I was itching to get on and score and the boys put a few on a plate for me and I was able to put them away.</p>
      <p>“I am always excited to put on a shirt. With the likes of Rash and Jadon around me and with Chilly and Trent putting in balls and Mason and Ox creating space with their forward runs, it is about getting in the right position and the balls will come.”</p>
      <p>Kane now has 31 international goals and only Wayne Rooney (53), Bobby Charlton (49), Gary Lineker (48), Jimmy Greaves (44) and Michael Owen (40) lie ahead of him in the England chart.</p>
