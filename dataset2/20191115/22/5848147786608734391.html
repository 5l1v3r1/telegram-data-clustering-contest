      <h1>The Ferguson Report: It’s a case of cows and effect</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:06:18+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/tim-ferguson/" target="_blank">Tim Ferguson</a></address>
      <h3>RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION ACT JUST AN ACT</h3>
      <p>The government’s Religious Discrimination bill is almost ready for public burning.</p>
      <p>A government spokesman stacking a woodpile said, “It will please both sides – everybody and nobody. We have to balance discriminators with discriminating against discriminators, and discriminating against anti-discriminators. The bill is not just fiction, it’s crucifixion.”</p>
      <p>When asked just how the Act would be worded, the PM said, “The Devil is in the detail. And also between the lines. And read all over.”</p>
      <p>He said the new Act will protect cross-bearers and cross-dressers, but not crossbenchers.</p>
      <p>A hypothetical cake-maker refused to make a hypothetical cake for anyone based in fact.</p>
      <p>“I’m sick of being thrown about in every debate, just because I’m notionally within the bounds of conjecture.”</p>
      <p>A government minister said, “Blessed are the discriminators! Let he who is without sin cast the first subpoena.”</p>
      <p>Should the Act be blocked, the faithful warn there will be smiting in the streets.</p>
      <h3>I KRAINE, WHO KRAINE, WE ALL KRAINE FOR UKRAINE</h3>
      <p>The futile impeachment of US President Donald Trump has been given a warm lettuce boost by the unsurprising revelation of Trump’s dodgy dealings with a country American voters have never heard of.</p>
      <p>A Whitehouse spokeswoman denied everything, including her denial.</p>
      <p>“Every witness who speaks at the Ukraine hearings is a fibber, especially the people hired by the President. He has a good eye for talent.”</p>
      <p>The president’s legal beagle offered his two <i>quid pro quo</i>’s worth – “It’s not a little white lie. It’s a little <i>Whitehouse</i> lie, which is much bigger but more deniable. Did I say that? No, I didn’t. Am I here? No, I’m not. See?”</p>
      <h3>COWS ENDANGERED SPECIES DUE TO ANIMAL OVER-ACTIVISM</h3>
      <p>Animal activists, climate scientists and vegan hipster<b> </b>seed-suckers have demanded the extinction of all cows to save the planet from methane emissions. They insist the emissions are dealt by the cows.</p>
      <p>A spokescow from Extinction Re-Bullion glued herself to a traffic island and sang, “We shall not be moo-o-oved.”</p>
      <p>A dreadlocked greenie eating a cabbage curry shifted in his seat at regular intervals. “It’s us or the cows. Believe me, I’m not blowing steam.”</p>
      <p>Scientists confirmed he was definitely not blowing steam.</p>
