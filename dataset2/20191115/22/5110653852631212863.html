      <h1>Steelers vs. Browns final score: Myles Garrett's helmet smash mars Cleveland win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:16:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bernstein</a></address>
      <p>Mason Rudolph finished an abysmal night against the Browns' defense Thursday with two fourth-quarter interceptions, including one that helped Cleveland secure its third touchdown of the game.</p>
      <p>The Browns picked off Rudolph four times total in their 21-7 win and recorded four sacks, but the biggest blow Rudolph took was from Myles Garrett, the Cleveland edge-rusher who smashed Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's dislodged helmet.</p>
      <p>The incident will almost certainly overshadow a solid victory by the Browns, and hefty suspensions and fines are a near-certainty.</p>
