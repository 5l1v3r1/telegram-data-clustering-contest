      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:09:52+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Tory Nadhim Zahawi triumphed in Stratford on Avon with an increased number of votes back in 2017 - but can he repeat the feat?</p>
      <p>His share rose by 4.5 per cent polling 32,657 votes - a majority of 20,958 over his nearest challenger Labour's Jeff Kenner, who received the backing of 11,699 electros.</p>
      <p>However this was an increase of 9.29 per cent on the party's 2015 haul - and a 2.4 per cent swing to Labour.</p>
      <p>The constituency includes the historic town itself, Warwick, and is the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company theatre.</p>
      <p>It is surrounded by green belt villages southeast of Birmingham. , with the next largest wards being Studley and Alcester each with just under 5,000 electors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>In 2019, Mr Zahawi will represent the Tories, and the full list of candidates can be seen below:</b>
      </p>
      <p>*Nadhim Zahawi (C)</p>
      <p>Felix Ling (Lab)</p>
      <p>Dominic Skinner (LD)</p>
      <p>Dave Passingham (Green)</p>
      <p>The electorate is some 70,800 people.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, elections are held every five years to determine which party will head up the British government. However since 2015, this year will be the third time that voters have been called to the ballot box.</p>
      <p>Following the controversial Brexit referendum in 2016, the public has witnessed tiresome debates in Parliament resulting in several failed exit deal suggestions.</p>
      <p>Three-and-a-half years on, we’re still quite a way off deciding what the state of play will be when the UK leaves the European Union. </p>
      <p>At present, Prime Minister, Boris Johnson does not have enough Conservative MPs to pass new laws and approve plans for a Brexit strategy. </p>
      <p>It is hoped the general election on December 12, will amend that.</p>
