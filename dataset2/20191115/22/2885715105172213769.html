      <p>Union minister of Road Transport and Highways <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nitin-gadkari">Nitin Gadkari</a> on Friday gave a go-ahead to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to undertake the Rs 135-crore project to build a multi-level flyover at Katraj junction to ease the traffic flow at the congested spot.</p>
      <p>The Union minister also laid the foundation stone of a Rs 80-crore project for widening and reconstruction of the 3.88-km stretch of national highway, from Navale bridge in Vadgaon Budhruk to Katraj junction.</p>
      <p>“The Pune Municipal Corporation has allotted the required land of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajiv-gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> Zoological Park in Katraj for the construction of the flyover. The NHAI will start the work soon. It is also going to use sound barriers on the flyover to ensure that the animals in the nearby zoo face no problems,” said Gadkari.</p>
      <p>The PMC had proposed to build a flyover at Katraj junction to resolve the traffic woes at the spot, where two highways intersect and which is also an entry point for Pune city. But the civic body couldn’t take up the work due to shortage of funds.</p>
      <p>The road widening work from Navale bridge to Katraj junction includes construction of a six-lane road, which will also have a service road, construction of one underpass for all vehicles, one for light vehicles, two pedestrian underpasses and four bus shelters. The work is expected to be completed within 18 months.</p>
      <p>The NHAI has also started constructing a multi-level flyover at Chandni Chowk but the project was delayed as the PMC failed to acquire the necessary land for the project. Once these projects are completed, they will be handed over to the PMC.</p>
