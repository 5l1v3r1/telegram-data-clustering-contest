      <p>Elite submission fighter, Ronaldo Souza, will move up to the Light Heavyweight division opposite powerful kickboxer, Jan Blachowicz, this Saturday (Nov. 16, 2019) at UFC Fight Night 164 from inside Ginasio do Ibirapuera in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
      <p>Souza has alternated wins and losses in his last six contests, a series of fights that effectively ended his dreams of contending for the 185-pound belt. Just a few weeks ahead of his 40th birthday, “Jacare” will put on an additional 20 pounds in pursuit of a fresh start. It’s a tantalizing option for current Middleweights: there’s the potential to jump up and fight for the title quickly, but it also could be a terrible idea that only ends in painful defeat.</p>
      <p>Which path will Souza walk? We’ll just have to wait and see. Until then, however, let’s take a closer look at his skill set.</p>
      <h3>Striking</h3>
      <p>Even at his age, Souza is a physical specimen, known to bully his opponents with power punches before throwing them to the mat. In the last couple years, however, Souza’s approach his become more strategic and more violent, though it remains relatively simple.</p>
      <p>Souza finds much of his success with a heavy right hand, one that usually arcs over his opponent’s guard <a href="http://www.thefightnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/JACARE.gif"><b>(GIF)</b></a>. The set ups are rarely all that complicated; “Jacare” tends to operate one or two strikes at a time. Mostly, Souza pressures his opponent back with good feints and level changes, using the threat of the takedown to land his overhand.</p>
      <p>In addition, Souza finds openings for his right as a counter and in the clinch. Much of the time his opponent tries to dart in with strikes, Souza will stand his ground and fire back a right. Once more, it’s an uncomplicated strategy, but Souza whacked even Whittaker across the grill with a couple strong right hands.</p>
      <p>In the clinch, most fighters try to push at Souza’s hips and get the hell away. Souza will hold on until he feels the takedown is no longer a reasonable option, at which point he’ll break the clinch with his right hand.</p>
      <p>Alongside the right, Souza likes to advance behind a stiff jab or left hook <a href="http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2014/02/Francis_Carmont_vs._Ronaldo_Souza__2.gif"><b>(GIF)</b></a>. Again, it’s largely single shots, as Souza feints until stepping forward with his left hand. Souza’s jab is not one to quickly tap his opponent’s nose: it smashes forward and gets Souza into takedown range. Feints help ensure these heavy shots are not easily countered, and Souza helps himself by going to the body on occasion as well.</p>
      <p>Finally, Souza will kick on occasion. While pressuring, he likes to jam a hard teep up the middle, which helps maneuver his foe towards the fence. In addition, Souza will briefly switch to Southpaw for just two reasons: to throw the left kick or to counter with his right as a check hook <a href="http://cdn2.cagepotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/methodgetsjacare3-08-19-12-10-56-13-517.gif"><b>(GIF)</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Against non-elite competition, Souza’s simple game tends to work quite well. However, Souza is sometimes prone to really forcing the fight without any bit of subtlety. This was really noticeable against Hermansson, as “Jacare” threw himself into the fire over and over, making it very obvious what he was going to throw.</p>
      <p>While the three main elements — big right hand, stiff left, and right snap kick — still make up the core of his game, Souza has improved on them in the last couple years. Perhaps most important, Souza does a better job of keeping his weight beneath him while advancing, allowing him to apply consistent pressure with these powerful blows. In addition, Souza’s left is now more often a powerful left hook, often to the body.</p>
      <p>Focusing more on the left hook has proven a smart choice for the Brazilian. Most helpfully, it pairs very well with the overhand, as Souza can slip his weight to his lead leg and force his opponent to guess: is the right hand about to loop over or is Souza loading up the hook? The wrong answer will be painful.</p>
      <p>Being able to target the body off the slip so often is great as well. Souza’s hard-nosed, consistent pressure approach is exhausting on its own, but body shots only add to that advantage. On that note, the right snap kick has the same effect of sapping energy. As Chris Weidman learned the hard way, Souza can slow his opponent’s feet with pressure, the left hook, and the snap kick, leaving his foe vulnerable to that powerful right <a href="https://i.gifer.com/3NoiS.gif"><b>(GIF)</b></a>.</p>

      <h3>Wrestling</h3>
      <p>A Judo black belt, Souza’s bullying habits are perhaps most obvious in his attempts to wrestle. Souza definitely has crafty ways to drag his opponent to the mat, but much of the time he just bulls his way forward and rushes into a double leg. His set ups are not the best, but once in on the hips Souza generally finishes the shot in one way or another.</p>
      <p>Often, simply yanking the legs back with all his explosive force is enough to plant his foe. Souza’s primary takedown setup comes from his overhand right. When his punches misses, Souza will continue the swing until his hand down by his waist. Since Souza already changed levels a bit to throw the punch, his hands are in position, and his opponent is likely covered up, it’s the perfect time to shoot for a double.</p>
      <p>Souza is very willing to finish wrestling takedowns using Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In the past, he’s snatched up a single leg only to pull himself into a deep half guard, which is an excellent sweeping position. Against Kelvin Gastelum, Souza dropped down into a leg lock, which quickly allowed him to scramble on top.</p>
      <p>In addition, Souza is a beast inside the clinch. He frequently attacks with inside trips in the clinch and often distracts his opponent with strikes first. For example, he tripped up Chris Camozzi by engaging the Muay Thai fighter with clinch strikes then tripping him when Camozzi looked for a knee.</p>
      <p>”Jacare” will also look for head and arm throws. Although these risky throws can cause him to lose position on the floor, Souza is so confident in his grappling that it doesn’t really matter.</p>
      <h3>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h3>
      <p>A jiu-jitsu black belt, Abu Dhabi Combat Club (ADCC) gold medalist, and multiple-time Mundials winner, Souza is perhaps the best jiu-jitsu competitor inside UFC today. Unlike some jiu-jitsu specialists, Souza has little interest in working from his back, instead looking to pressure his foe from top position.</p>
      <p>Firstly, Souza’s guard passing game is phenomenal. His posture is frequently strong, and his hips are always heavy on his opponent. If his opponent starts to defend a pass, Souza will pause the pass in order to land a few hard punches. Then, he’ll throw an underhook in and hop around his opponent’s guard.</p>
      <p>Another excellent thing Souza does is make it very difficult for his opponent to secure a full guard. Though the offensive options are limited, it is much easier to hold a talented grappler inside the closed guard simply by squeezing. However, Souza usually attempts to pin a butterfly hook or land in half guard immediately after hitting a takedown. From either of these positions, Souza can more easily advance into a dominant spot as his foe is forced to grapple with him rather than hold on.</p>
      <p>Once Souza is passed the guard, he’ll transition between dominant positions like side control, north-south, and mount. If his opponent simply allows this to happen, then Souza will pick his shots with heavy ground strikes. Most of the time, Souza’s opponent uses these opportunities to attempt to recover guard. Even if his opponent is successful, “Jacare” is thoroughly unconcerned; he’ll just pass guard again.</p>
      <p>Just take a look at Souza flowing all over Robbie Lawler <a href="http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/803933/j2_medium.gif"><b>(GIF)</b></a>.</p>
      <p>It’s only once Souza’s foe is actively trying to defend that “Jacare” will really attack with submissions. He usually attacks with kimuras, arm triangles, and armbars during these exchanges. All of those moves are utilized when the bottom man’s arm is out of position, which often occurs in MMA due to the bottom man’s need to protect his face while he elbow escapes.</p>
      <p>For example, Souza nearly ripped Tim Boetsch’s arm off with a kimura. After advancing into mount, the threat of Souza’s punches saw Boetsch hurry to turn to his side and hip escape back to some type of guard. In the process, Souza grabbed his wrist and latched onto the arm, pinning it behind Boetsch’s back before Boetsch had an opportunity to flatten back out.</p>
      <p>Two more examples came opposite Chris Camozzi. In the first match, Souza quickly passed the open guard immediately after Camozzi recovered it. The Brazilian then slid into knee on belly and landed a punch. Mounted by a power-punching black belt, Camozzi desperately attempted to hip escape. However, he turned a bit too much in his bump, which allowed “Jacare” to swim his arm around Camozzi’s head and arm. When Camozzi turns back in to hook one on Souza’s legs, he’s actually turning into the arm triangle choke <a href="https://middleeasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/771909433.gif"><b>(GIF)</b></a>. The rematch was remarkably similar, except that Camozzi tried to push Souza off him from mount and wound up in an armbar instead.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the best grappling performance of Souza’s mixed martial arts (MMA) career came in his rematch with Gegard Mousasi. Souza’s constant aggression wore down Mousasi and eventually allowed him to snatch a guillotine from top position, but Souza’s guard passing was particularly masterful. In the first match, Mousasi managed to catch Souza coming forward with a fight-ending upkick, and he repeatedly looked for that technique in the rematch. However, Souza was well-aware of the threat, and he waited for Mousasi to upkick. Instead of diving in and risking the kick, Souza hung back and used the upkick to throw Mousasi’s leg to the side, which allowed Souza to advance into dominant positions and nullify Mousasi’s dangerous bottom game.</p>
      <p>The exception to Souza’s opportunistic, transitional attack is his back mount. When Souza latches onto his opponent’s back, he has no intention of letting go or allowing his opponent to move. Instead, he locks in a body triangle, squeezes, and tries to jam his forearm under his foe’s jaw. “Jacare’s” control from this position is excellent, and it’s simply a matter of time until he bores through his opponent’s defenses.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Souza is still a dangerous fighter, but it seems like he’s becoming more prone to “off nights,” which is not a great sign. Perhaps a less severe weight cut will help with this issue and allow him to push for takedowns more often. It could also take away his usual physicality advantage — there’s really only one way to find out!</p>
