      <h2>The show was hampered with a number of difficulties throughout the evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:04:58+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:04</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Tess Daly cut an interview on Children In Need short after there was a huge technical gaffe.</p>
      <p>Her presenting partner Ade Adepitan was forced to apologise when the star-studded annual show's sound failed to match the picture on the screen on Friday.</p>
      <p>Ade said: "Hey we are experiencing technical problems in London so apologies for that."</p>
      <p>He added in jest: "Could be some wet leaves in the wifi or something like that."</p>
      <p>His apology come after Tess chopped talk time on the show short during one interview when the show suffered technical difficulties.</p>

      <p>She had said: "Now then, all over the country you fabulous folk have been doing your thing for Children in Need. So let’s have a look at what’s been going on in your area!"</p>
      <p>The screen then showed the postal museum in London.</p>
      <p>The presenter explained: “Hi I’m Riz Lateef, welcome to our Children in Need party where we’re thanking some of our fabulous fundraisers from across the capital."</p>

      <p>But Children In Need were forced to wrap up the scene pretty quickly when the sound failed to match the picture on screen.</p>
      <p>Social media was awash with complaints with viewers about the sound at home.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCOne">@BBCOne</a> you need to turn up the presenters mic's on Children in Need. Cant hear a word," one fan wrote, leading the angry troops.</p>
      <p>Others added " <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChildrenInNeed2019?src=hashtag_click">#ChildrenInNeed2019</a> is a mess. Glitching all over the place and thrive just cut that lad off."</p>
      <p>"What’s going on with children in need editing/sound/producing? Very bad. Poor kid on the violin earlier...cut to something else...sound and VTs all over the place...woman talking about ‘the south and london’...what about the rest of the UK?? Sort it out <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCCiN">@BBCCiN</a> ."</p>
      <p>The show was hampered with a number of difficulties throughout the evening.</p>
      <p>Telly screens also pixellated at times when the technical side failed the show.</p>
      <p>Children In Need raised a total of £35.383,512 following a very glitzy opening with a special performance from Big the Musical.</p>
      <p>Stars Jay McGuinness, Kimberley Walsh, Matthew Kelly and Wendi Peters took their talents to the stage.</p>
      <p>Kimberley stunned in a scarlet strapless dress as she was twirled around the dancefloor by former Strictly and The Wanted star Jay.</p>

      <p>The great and the good of the showbiz world got involved in the glittering show for charity.</p>
      <p>Doctor Who's Jodie Whittaker made Anastasia's dreams come true as she come to greet her on stage.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, live from all over the country the Children In Need choir belted out their best vocals.</p>
      <p>All the crowds of school children were singing Cyndi Lauper's True Colours in tune.</p>
      <p>Louis Tomlinson also put on an emotional performance when he sung We Made It from his new album.</p>
      <p>Later, Alfie Boe gave a soulful performance as he sung Something Inside So Strong by Labi Siffre.</p>
      <p>The One Show's Matt Baker led a team of youngesters on the 400-mile journey for The Rickshaw Challenge.</p>
      <p>They finished their emotional road trip on the Children In Need show and the team alone achieved more than eight million for the charity.</p>
      <p>EastEnders star Maisie Smith was crowned Children In Need's Strictly winner.</p>
      <p>So it's no surprise fans pleaded the actress, 18, to sign up to the BBC dance show to compete for the Glitter Ball trophy next year.</p>
      <p>The soap star, who plays Tiffany Butcher on Albert Square, worked her magic on the dance floor with her partner Kevin Clifton after gruelling training for a week ahead of the show.</p>
      <p>Maisie had impressed fans and judges alike as head judge Shirley Ballas, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Motsi Mabuse voted her the winner.</p>
      <p>She had competed against Ricky Champ (Stuart Highway), Louisa Lytton (Ruby Allen) and Rudolph Walker (Patrick Trueman) in the dazzling group dance.</p>
