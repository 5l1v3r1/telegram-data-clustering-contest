      <p>DAY one of the Zomaland 2.0 food &amp; entertainment carnival was cancelled due to the complaints made by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-was-the-battle-of-koregaon-mahar-dalit-marathas-maharashtra-bandh-5009488/">Koregaon</a> Park and Mundhwa residents. Thousands of people all across the city and from outside Pune, who had bought the tickets, faced a lot of inconvenience due to the cancellation.</p>
      <p>Local residents were disturbed due to long traffic jams on the streets around their homes.</p>
      <p>Riya Rohatgi, who had come for the festival, said, “It is sad to find out last minute that the event got cancelled, especially when it is a Friday evening. We had made plans to enjoy here but were asked to go back when we reached the gate. The management could have taken steps to inform us earlier, so that one could make other plans.”</p>
      <p>Krithika Ravi Iyer said, “It is true that a lot of inconvenience was caused to the residents because of the event. A huge traffic chaos led to a lot of delays, especially for the people who were going back from work. Organisers should have foreseen all the possible circumstances in advance and should have taken action.”</p>
      <p>“From a volunteer’s point of view, we were well prepared for everything but the actual problem arose because of the people staying in nearby societies. All the legal documentation was done, permission was taken but a complaint lodged by the residents about the traffic situation led to the event being cancelled. It led to a lot of wastage of food since they were preparing for it from morning. It also led to a lot of wastage in terms of labour, money and time,” said Prasenjit Sripesh, a volunteer.</p>
