      <h1>Spotify tests karaoke style lyrics support on its mobile apps</h1>

      <p>Spotify may about to get a lot better for karaoke enthusiasts. The tech firm has started testing out a new feature in select regions where users can see synced lyrics while playing music. In essence, the lyrics scroll on time with the song, allowing users of the service to sing along as they go.</p>
      <p>The test is only in a limited few regions with Canada, Mexico and Indonesia confirmed via screenshots on Twitter. While Spotify offered a Behind The Lyrics feature, that was more or less useless for sing-alongs. Users would get a smattering lyrics interspersed with commentary about why the artist chose a certain lyric or tune.</p>
      <p>“We can confirm we are testing this feature in a small number of markets,” a Spotify spokesperson told TechCrunch. “At Spotify, we are always testing new products and experiences but have no further news to share at this time.”</p>
      <p>Apple Music and Deezer both currently offer a similar feature, while Google’s music services don’t. If the test is successful, Spotify may roll out this feature globally. Of course, as all tech tests go, that’s a pretty big If.</p>
