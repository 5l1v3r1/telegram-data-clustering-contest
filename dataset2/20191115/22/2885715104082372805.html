      <h1>Pune: Three cheated of Rs 12 lakh after being promised jobs in MES</h1>
      <h2>Key accused is suspended MES employee; he was earlier arrested for similar fraud and is lodged in jail: Police</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:47:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>IN ANOTHER case of cheating by issuing fake recruitment letters of the Indian Army, three persons were allegedly duped of Rs 12 lakh by fraudsters, claiming to be Army personnel, who promised them jobs in the Military Engineering Services (MES) at the Army’s Southern Command.</p>
      <p>Police have booked four persons after one of the victims, Sharad Goyekar (26), a resident of Walhekarwadi, lodged an FIR at the Bundgarden police station. A case has been registered under sections of cheating and offences related to documents of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
      <p>According to police, so far, the probe showed that the key accused in this matter is the same suspended employee of the MES, who was arrested on August 31 for duping job aspirants by promising them appointments at the MES and giving them fake recruitment letters.</p>
      <p>The accused, Ganesh Babulal Pardeshi, who is in his early 50s, was suspended from the MES in 2015 over similar complaints.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in a joint operation by the Southern Command Liaison Unit of Military Intelligence and the Pune City Police, but was soon released on bail.</p>
      <p>Police suspect Pardeshi continued to cheat job aspirants, and that between September 5 and 15, he and three others came into contact with Goyekar and his friends, Ankush Ambadas Dharane and Shriram Chavan, near the parking lot of the Southern Command gate.</p>
      <p>Police said the accused claimed to be Army personnel and assured Goyekar, Dharane and Chavan jobs at the MES in positions such as ‘lower division clerk’ and ‘store keeper’.</p>
      <p>Goyekar and his friends, police said, gave the accused Rs 12 lakh but never got the jobs that were promised.</p>
      <p>Sub-Inspector N Birajdar of Bundgarden police station, who is investigating the case, said, “The fraudsters claimed to be Army personnel and took money from the victims by promising them jobs in the MES. The fraudsters even gave fake recruitment letters to the victims. The probe, so far, has showed that one of the four accused is Pardeshi. He is presently lodged in Yerwada Central Prison. He was earlier arrested in a case registered at the Wanavdi police station, but was released on bail, after which he continued to cheat people. There are some offences lodged against him and he was once again arrested for one of them. We might be taking him into custody as part of the investigation in this case.”</p>
      <p>In a similar case, a joint probe by Military Intelligence and Satara police had brought to light a racket of issuing fake recruitment letters that revealed the involvement of three serving jawans of the Indian Army.</p>
