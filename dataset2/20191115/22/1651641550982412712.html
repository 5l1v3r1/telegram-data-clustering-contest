      <p>Google has made it slightly easier to project your holiday photos and videos on the big screen from your Android phone using the Files by Google app.</p>
      <p>They have updated the gallery in the Files by Google app to support media streaming, both to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/amazon-finally-starts-selling-chromecast-3rd-gen-and-chromecast-ultra/">Chromecast</a> and also other smart TVs.</p>

      <p>The feature is available in version 1.0.27 of the app and is only accessible from the media viewer.</p>
      <p>Despite the new useful feature, Files by Google is still very much focussed on clearing your storage and uploading your files to Google Cloud, with Google listing the main features as:</p>
      <p>1) Free up space – Clean junk files and cache, boost your mobile phone or tablet as you clean up the phone memory, and optimise your smartphone performance.<br/>2) Find files fast – Browse your storage and find everything fast without being an expert in file management.<br/>3) Share files – Send pictures, share videos, transfer large files or app APKs. All of this with super-fast speed up to 480 Mbps over an encrypted, direct Wi-Fi network.</p>
      <p>If that strikes your fancy find the tool in the Google Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files">here</a>.</p>
