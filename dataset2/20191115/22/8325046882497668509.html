      <p>Since 2010, an estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm">7,000 to 26,000</a> children under 5 years old have been hospitalized for the flu in the US, alone.</p>
      <p>“Infants are proven more likely to be hospitalized or die from influenza illness, so all infants eligible for the vaccine should receive it,” says <a href="https://www.jointhecenter.org/providers/charisma-garcia-md">Charisma Garcia</a>, MD, a pediatrician with the Center for Children and Women at Texas Children’s Health Plan.</p>
      <h4>When can infants get the flu shot?</h4>
      <p>“Infants starting at 6 months can get the flu shot,” Garcia says.</p>
      <p>Children between 6 months to 8 years old getting their first flu vaccine will need two injections spaced at least four weeks apart. The second dose gives the first dose an extra boost, and the interval provides the first dose enough time to reach its peak effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Once your child reaches 2 years of age, they are eligible for the nasal-spray vaccine in place of the shot, although the spray hasn’t been <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-effective-is-the-flu-shot">as effective</a> as the shot in children. And with flu strains and vaccines changing from year to year, Garcia recommends that parents follow expert advice.</p>
      <p>“Every new flu season check with your pediatrician for the latest recommended formulation,” Garcia says.</p>
      <h4>What if my infant is too young to get a flu shot?</h4>
      <p>There are no vaccine products approved for infants younger than 6 months, which means parents must take extra care to protect their infant from infection.</p>
      <p>The best way to protect your newborn is to make sure everyone who will be close by <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-to-prevent-the-flu">is vaccinated</a>. But there are also measures that the mother can take before giving birth.</p>
      <p>While she’s still pregnant, mom should <a href="https://www.insider.com/can-you-get-a-flu-shot-while-pregnant">get a flu shot</a> because the antibodies she builds up can pass through the placenta and provide months of immunity for her infant after birth.</p>
      <h4>Possible side effects from the flu shot</h4>
      <p>After vaccination, infants and children will sometimes experience minor <a href="https://www.insider.com/does-the-flu-shot-give-you-the-flu">side effects</a> such as redness and soreness at the injection site, fever, and aches. These symptoms are normal and a sign your kid’s immune system is working properly.</p>
      <p>It’s also normal if your child ends up catching the flu, even though they’ve been vaccinated. It’s less common, but in a given season, the flu vaccine is usually <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-effective-is-the-flu-shot">40 to 60% effective</a>. This means they have a 40 to 60% chance of getting sick with the flu if they are exposed to it.</p>
      <p>But that doesn’t mean you should avoid getting your child vaccinated. “The vaccine reduces the risk of severe morbidity from influenza by three-fourths,” Garcia adds.</p>
      <p>So your best bet is getting your child vaccinated and practicing proper hygiene techniques like <a href="https://www.insider.com/how-long-should-you-wash-your-hands">hand washing</a> and sanitizing toys.</p>
