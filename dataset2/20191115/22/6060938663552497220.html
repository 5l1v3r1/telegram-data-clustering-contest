      <p>MUMBAI: After waiting on the fringes of India’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/steel">steel</a> sector for 13 years, business tycoon L N <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mittal">Mittal</a> is set to make it to the centre stage with the acquisition of Essar Steel. After the Supreme Court approved Mittal’s resolution plan for the bankrupt <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Essar-Steel">Essar Steel</a> on Friday, he said he is “looking forward to closing the acquisition soon”. This acquisition will make Mittal the third-largest private metal player in India, behind JSW Steel and Tata Steel.</p>
      <p>Mittal’s India play is expected to alter the dynamics of the steel industry, but analysts say the impact would be mainly on small players and not on large entities. “Domestic companies like Tata Steel and JSW Steel have large-scale operations in India and they also compete with Mittal in certain major markets globally,” said Gaurav Dua, head (capital market strategy and investments), Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.</p>
      <p>Mittal’s ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest metal company, has partnered with Japan’s Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo to acquire Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal holds a majority stake in the JV, which has made a payment of Rs 42,000 crore for Essar Steel and will infuse another Rs 8,000 crore to improve the bankrupt entity’s operations.</p>

      <p>The JV intends to ramp up shipments of Essar Steel, the largest metal maker in western India, to 15 million tonnes from 8.5 million tonnes. “We wish ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel the very best on their entry into the Indian market. They are acquiring a world-class facility in a market that has a long runway for growth,” said a spokesperson of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Essar-Group">Essar Group</a>, the erstwhile promoter of Essar Steel.</p>
      <p>Ironically, ArcelorMittal-Nippon gets control of Essar Steel at a time when metal prices are sliding, and demand is softening in India. The automobile industry, on which the steel sector depends for 20% of its business, is also facing its worst challenges in more than a decade.</p>
      <p>Domestic players grappled with declining margins during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as prices fell sharply amid demand weakness and high inventories. Established players had said that there won’t be a “Jio” moment in the steel industry despite ArcelorMittal-Nippon’s entry.</p>
      <p>It couldn’t be ascertained whether ArcelorMittal-Nippon plans to make any changes to the existing team running Essar Steel. “Typically, in such deals, some top-level changes are effected. Some senior employees from the parent company are usually sent on permanent or temporary basis to do a reality check. The parent would want to implement its own strategy and would like to have its ear to the ground and is expected to relocate people from other parts of the business to India to oversee the transition. Key posts like CFO, CHRO are likely to be filled from the parent to implement a culture change and align with global policies,” said Ronesh Puri, MD, Executive Access (India). He added that lower levels are usually given a long rope to see how they perform on achieving the deliverables and help the firm course correct. Essar Steel, led by CEO Dilip Oomen, has 4,500 people on its rolls.</p>
      <p>Over the past 13 years, Mittal made several attempts to get a foot in the door of the Indian steel market. The India-born magnate tried to set up greenfield plants in Jharkhand and Odisha in 2005 and 2006, but they didn’t materialise.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the tycoon signed an agreement with the Karnataka government to set up a 6-million-tonne plant. Land acquisition process for this project has been completed recently. He had also inked an automotive steel venture with state-owned Steel Authority of India but that too was unsuccessful. After overcoming more than a decade of bureaucratic and legal hurdles, Mittal is now set for a run-in with macro-economic challenges that entail steering Essar Steel.</p>
