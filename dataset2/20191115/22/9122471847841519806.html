      <h1>49ers Reporter Has Promising Update On WR Emmanuel Sanders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T22:50:13+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>When the San Francisco 49ers take the field this Sunday they most likely won’t have George Kittle, however, the offense might have Emmanuel Sanders at its disposal.</p>
      <p>San Francisco didn’t have Sanders for all of the second half against Seattle on <i>Monday Night Football</i>. His absence really hurt the offense and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, who has quickly developed chemistry with the veteran wideout.</p>
      <p>The 49ers are hopeful that Sanders will be active this Sunday despite dealing with a rib injury.</p>
      <p>According to Matt Barrows of The Athletic, Sanders did a little more each day during the week and will try to play this weekend.</p>
      <p>Sanders didn’t officially practice for the 49ers during the week though.</p>
      <p>He’s listed as questionable on the team’s final injury report.</p>

      <p>If the 49ers don’t have Sanders this weekend against the Arizona Cardinals, the offense will need big contributions from Deebo Samuel and Kendrick Bourne.</p>
      <p>With an important matchup coming up very soon with the Green Bay Packers, it makes sense for the 49ers to be cautious with Sanders. After all, the team did ship out two draft picks to acquire him from the Denver Broncos.</p>
      <p>Fans will know more about Sanders’ status on Sunday as he appears to be a true game-time decision.</p>
