      <p>Gareth Southgate wants England to turn Wembley into a fortress for the biggest summer of his players’ careers.</p>
      <p>England have now qualified and got the dates in the diary - June 14, 19 and 23 - when they will play their three Euro 2020 Group matches in the “home tournament” and the whole nation expects.</p>
      <p>It is arguably the best chance of success since Euro 96 as the sense of anticipation begins to build with Wembley also hosting semi finals and final.</p>
      <p>The England boss believes it will be an “incredible experience” for the country and claims they are now ready to thrash minnows in qualifying campaigns but also compete with the very best in tournaments.</p>

      <p>Southgate gave his squad a rabble-rousing message after the 7-0 win over Montenegro as he stressed Wembley should be a stadium that opposing teams fear to help them deliver their first trophy since 1966.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be an incredible experience for the players, for our fans,” said Southgate. “We want to make Wembley somewhere that teams fear coming, that’s part of the message I gave to the players after the game.</p>
      <p>“So, yes, it’ll be a very, very special event to be a part of. And the players deserve it, you know. They’ve played extremely well against opponents we should beat, in a group we should win, for sure, but the quality of their play and the number of goals they’ve scored…</p>
      <p>“I used to look at Germany in qualification and they were racking up sixes and sevens and we used to be struggling to break down teams who played with a low block.</p>

      <p>“We’ve now managed to play in a way that’s been able to solve that problem. Now we’ve got to solve the different sorts of problems that come with the higher-ranked opponents, and that’s the challenge of the next few months.”</p>
      <p>Southgate has bittersweet memories of Euro 96 when football was supposed to be coming home but it ended in heartbreak and his missed penalty in the shoot-out.</p>
      <p>But those heady days live long in the memory and, rather like last summer’s World Cup in Russia, the nation united behind the England team.</p>
      <p>Southgate fielded the youngest England team for 60 years against Montenegro - with an average age of 23 years and 255 days - and the success through the age groups is supposed to come to fruition in the next two to three years.</p>
      <p>But Southgate says that he must get the balance between youth and experience right while also bracing himself for the inevitable setbacks and injuries which is why he will not settle on one set starting XI.</p>

      <p>Southgate said: “You can never tell because you just don’t know who’s going to be available, who’s going to be on form. We’ve got a fairly settled squad, but there are obviously players who’ve been with us in the last 18 months and are still in our thinking.</p>
      <p>“We are always learning about the players more in the really big matches and the really high-pressure games. But we feel the team (against Montenegro) was extremely young, the squad is young.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to get the balance right with that but these, in most cases, are our best players.</p>
      <p>“Although next summer is going to be before a lot of them peak, we can still be hugely competitive and our challenge is to be able to compete, as we found a way to compete in Russia, with a squad that’s very exciting.</p>
      <p>“But that best team can change over the next six months, with form, certainly with injury. So, we’ve always got to prepare, keep the squad involved, prepare the squad in the best possible way, because in the end, we could invest in securing an eleven now and then, come March, three or four could be out.</p>
      <p>“Ox is the classic example of that. We thought in March ahead of the World Cup he was in a really good groove to give the sorts of performances that he’s given. Then, he’s out and you’ve got to go back to the drawing board.</p>
      <p>“So, the good thing is we’ve got really good options in every position, and that’s key, because you’ll all remember plenty of tournaments where we’ve had a key injury on the eve of the tournament, and then we’ve all been in meltdown about what might happen. So, there is some strength in depth.”</p>
