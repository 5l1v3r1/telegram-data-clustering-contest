      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minnesota man who <a href="https://apnews.com/99a8977ed1f54f02bbec37b98363c94a">shot and wounded a school bus driver</a> on a Minneapolis freeway during a snowstorm has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison.</p>
      <p>Thirty-two-year-old <a href="https://apnews.com/f42bbff90e5344d191679215c8332c70">Kenneth Lilly</a>, of St. Paul, pleaded guilty in August to first-degree assault for the February attack that left Thomas Benson deaf in one ear and unable to continue working as a bus driver due to nerve damage in his hand. Lilly was sentenced Friday to 86 months.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Benson was trying to merge onto the highway when his bus scraped Lilly's car, although Benson was unaware. During a traffic jam, Lilly walked in front of the bus and fired five shots into the windshield, wounding Benson’s arm and grazing his head. A girl on the bus was not hurt.</p>
      <p>Defense attorneys asked for three years, citing Lilly’s “documented history of cognitive limitations.”</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>This story has been corrected to show that Benson was unaware his bus scraped Lilly’s car.</p>
