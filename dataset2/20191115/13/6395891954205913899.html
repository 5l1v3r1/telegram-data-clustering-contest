      <p><b>CONWAY, S.C. (AP)</b> - Genealogy websites and a cheek swab enabled U.S. Marshals to arrest a man suspected of being the "Potomac River Rapist," who terrorized the nation's capital in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>News outlets report 60-year-old Giles Daniel Warrick is now awaiting extradition from Horry County, South Carolina. He's accused of raping 10 women and killing one of them between 1991 and 1998.</p>
      <p>Montgomery County, Maryland, police Chief Marcus Jones says DNA evidence matched family profiles in genealogy services, enabling investigators to narrow their search after interviewing Warrick's relatives.</p>
      <p>Warrick had moved to South Carolina after working as a landscaper in Maryland. Police said detectives questioned him and obtained a cheek swab with his DNA to provide the match to crime scene evidence.</p>
      <p>It's unclear whether Warrick has a lawyer to speak for him.</p>
