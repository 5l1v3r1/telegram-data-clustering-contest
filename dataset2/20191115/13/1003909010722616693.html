      <h1>Calgary author JoAnn McCaig maps out tale of sexuality, power and ambition with sophomore novel, An Honest Woman</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Volmers</a></address>
      <p>It would be a little too perfect if the inspiration for JoAnn McCaig’s An Honest Woman came from an erotic dream.</p>
      <p>It didn’t. But the reality of its origins are not that far off. Fifteen years ago, the Calgary author was returning from a retreat at a writer’s colony at St. Peter’s Abbey in Muenster, Sask., when a bit of unusual inspiration struck.</p>
      <p>“I had done my two-week colony and was working on a piece that was quite difficult, quite dark and bleak and difficult to work on,” says McCaig. “As I was driving back in August through these canola fields, everything was bright yellow and bright blue, I started just having this strange, erotic fantasy. I thought ‘This is weird. What’s up with this?’”</p>
      <p>“A hundred miles later,” it was still there, she says.</p>
      <p>“I thought ‘Maybe, I’ll write it down but not like writing, writing, just scribbling it down on a piece of paper,’” she says. “This weird erotic fantasy became the centrepiece of An Honest Woman.”</p>
      <p>Eventually, McCaig would create the character who creates the character who creates the erotic fantasy. It became a springboard for other ideas in An Honest Woman.</p>
      <p>“They are also interrogating themselves about all sorts of things: About sexuality, about power, about ambition and imagination,” says McCaig, who will hold an author event with fellow Alberta writers Kat Cameron and Sophie Stocking on Nov. 23 at the Central Library. “The initial impetus came out in one piece. Over the intervening years, I built this story around it using two different narrators to look at the story and what it might mean.”</p>
      <p>If all this sounds complicated, that’s because it is. An Honest Woman, which Thistleldown Press describes as a “very bookish novel,” involves a character named JM. Her “lucid dream” finds her “engulfed in a conflagration of carnal desire and writerly ambition” and inspires her to write a novel. In that novel, she creates a English professor named Janet Mair, who escapes a rather dull life with her own carnal daydreams while also writing a novel.</p>
      <p>“You really do need a map for this book,” McCaig says with a laugh. “And I do supply one.”</p>
      <p>This may be one of the reasons why An Honest Woman took 15 years and multiple consultations with fellow members of McCaig’s East Village Writers Group to complete. A followup to her 2000 debut, The Textbook of the Rose, the novel is a complex piece of metafiction that includes literary allusions and frequent flights into fantasy.</p>
      <p>In short, it’s the sort of book that seems to perfectly fit into McCaig’s background. She is co-owner of Calgary’s Shelf Life Books and spent 20 years teaching English Literature at the University of Calgary.</p>
      <p>“Even in my normal life, I’m a horrible pain in the butt,” she says. “When my kids were watching Simpsons episodes, I’d be calling out over the kitchen counter ‘That’s a reference to Hamlet, you know.’ My hope is that my book can be enjoyed by anybody, but a person … who has a degree in English might catch some things that others may not.”</p>
      <p>There are references to Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre. There’s a dinner party scene where one of McCaig’s characters confronts a “really famous, curmudgeonly British writer.”</p>
      <p>In another segment, Janet has an argument with a “very famous Canadian author.”</p>
      <p>“Anybody who has been around Canadian literature a little while would recognize this very famous Canadian writer that Janet has an argument with,” McCaig says. “Janet wins the argument. That’s how you know it’s fiction, because in real life nobody ever wins an argument with this particular writer.”</p>
      <p>But An Honest Woman isn’t just fiction, it’s metafiction. After all, there are two novels being written within the novel.  McCaig says she has always been interested in examining the process. Her PhD was on Canadian short story writer Alice Munro, who was also the subject of McCaig’s critical study, Reading In: Alice Munro’s Archives.</p>
      <p>“When I researched her, it wasn’t her stories I looked at,” she says. “It was her correspondence surrounding those stories. So I guess it’s just kind of an obsession of mine to be interested in interrogating how fiction is created.”</p>
