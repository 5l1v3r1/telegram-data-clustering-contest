      <p>A man serving a life sentence for murdering an offshore worker has died in prison.</p>
      <p>Steven Dickie, 24, was convicted earlier this year over the killing of Steven Donaldson, whose body was discovered in a car park at Kinnordy Nature Reserve near Kirriemuir, Angus, on June 7 last year.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) confirmed on Friday that Dickie had died at HMP Perth.</p>
      <p>The SPS said police have been informed and a fatal accident inquiry will be held.</p>
      <p>Dickie and co-accused Callum Davidson were convicted in May of murdering Mr Donaldson following a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh and jailed for life.</p>
      <p>Dickie was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years behind bars, while Davidson was told he must spend at least 24 years in jail.</p>

      <p>The court heard Mr Donaldson, 27, from Arbroath, had been lured to his death and was subjected to a “sustained and prolonged” attack involving extreme levels of violence.</p>
      <p>Dickie and Davidson attacked Mr Donaldson after he had arranged to meet Glass, believing they would be meeting to discuss their relationship.</p>
      <p>Mr Donaldson was initially attacked at the Peter Pan children’s play park at Kirriemuir, before he was transported to the nature reserve.</p>
      <p>There, he was hit again on the head and body with a knife and a baseball bat and was repeatedly struck on the neck with a heavy, bladed weapon before his car was set on fire.</p>
      <p>An SPS spokesman said: “Steven Alexander Dickie, 24, a prisoner at HMP Perth, has died.</p>
      <p>“He was convicted at Edinburgh Court on May 30, 2019. Police Scotland have been advised and the matter reported to the procurator fiscal.</p>
      <p>“A fatal accident inquiry will be held in due course.”</p>
