      <p>It’s been a while since a Crytek game pushed PC hardware to its limits, so the developer came up with the next best thing.</p>
      <p><b>Crytek</b>, developer of the Crysis series, and more recently Hunt Showdown, has released a free new benchmark designed to assess your PC’s ray tracing performance.</p>
      <p>The tool is built on the developer’s <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/03/18/crytek-real-time-ray-tracing-neon-noir-demo-amd-gpu/">Neon Noir Cryengine tech demo</a>, which showed off ray tracing running on non-Nvidia RTX GPUs. Because of this, the tool works with most GPUs – assuming they meet or exceed its minimum requirements, of course.</p>
      <p>Neon Noir – by design – doesn’t rely on DXR or Vulkan’s ray tracing tech, which is how it’s able to run on a wide range of hardware and API. This also means it won’t necessarily take advantage of recent updates to these popular APIs, which could skewer the results a bit.</p>
      <p>The benchmark can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.cryengine.com/marketplace/product/neon-noir#">Cryengine Marketplace</a>, which means you’ll have to create an account. You’ll also need to install the Cryengine launcher, which is how you’ll be able to access the demo.</p>
