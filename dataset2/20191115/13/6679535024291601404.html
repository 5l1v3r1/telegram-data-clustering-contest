      <p>THANJAVUR</p>
      <p>The All India Insurance Employees’ Association has reiterated the demand to exempt life insurance premium payment from the service tax network for the benefit of insurance policy holders/applicants.</p>
      <p>Talking to reporters here on Friday, the AIIEA Thanjavur division president, S.Selvaraj, and general secretary, V.Sethuraman, claimed that levy of tax under Goods and Services Tax for the services availed from the insurance companies was viewed as an additional burden by the policy holders, particularly those who consider taking a life insurance policy as a tool to save money.</p>
      <p>Earlier, when service tax was levied on the policy premiums the customers were required to pay 2 to 12.5% of the premium amount as service tax depending on the policy and the policy-related services. This was objected to by the association then, in vain.</p>
      <p>Now, after the introduction of GST it had been hiked to 18 to 24% depending on the service availed by the customers, they pointed out.</p>
      <p>Stating that it was absurd to collect service tax on life insurance premiums while offering income tax concession for the same amount, they said that till 2014 the Life Insurance Corporation bore the burden of remitting the service tax to the government, which was supposed to be collected from the customers along with the premium amount.</p>
      <p>The concession extended to the LIC customers was suspended as the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority preferred to provide a level-playing field in the insurance sector for nationalised and private insurance companies, they said.</p>
      <p>While apprehending that levying of hefty percentage of service tax would wean away the interest of customers from buying life insurance products, they said that LIC still lead the pack with 73% share in the life insurance market.</p>
      <p>In order to press for their demand, the AIIEA has completed a signature campaign where four members of Parliament and 12 members of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in the eight districts coming under the AIIEA Thanjavur division had signed the petition to be forwarded to the GST Council through Minister D. Jayakumar.</p>
