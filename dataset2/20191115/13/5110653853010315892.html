      <h1>Fantasy Football Injury Updates: Matthew Stafford, Jacoby Brissett affect Week 11 QB rankings</h1>

      <p>There was a point Wednesday where it looked like Jacoby Brissett and Matthew Stafford would both be ready to return in Week 11, but the Stafford news got cloudier. At least the Colts should have Brissett back, a big boost to their offense as he slides into the middle of our Week 11 fantasy QB rankings. Stafford's injured back still could hold him out and subject us to another thrilling week of starting quarterback Jeff Driskel for Detroit. We have the latest updates below.</p>

      <h3>Will Matthew Stafford play in Week 11?</h3>
      <p>Stafford wasn't listed by Matt Patricia as an injury before Wednesday's practice, but then <a href="https://twitter.com/Justin_Rogers/status/1194680479754141697">he observed the whole practice from the sideline</a> while Jeff Driskel took first-team reps. Stafford is dealing with broken bones in his back. Stafford proceeded to miss practice Thursday, as well.</p>
      <p>Stafford's presence is huge for the viability of the rest of the Lions offense -- Kenny Golladay and maybe T.J. Hockenson are the only players you can consider starting if fantasy if Driskel gets the nod for the second straight week.</p>

      <h3>Jacoby Brissett injury update</h3>
      <p>Colts head coach Frank Reich said Brissett would start in Week 11 if he got a full practice in on Wednesday. Well, Brissett <a href="https://www.heraldbulletin.com/sports/colts-notebook-brissett-on-track-to-start-after-wednesday-s/article_b8953710-0678-11ea-8709-93c0e66c1ef0.html#utm_campaign=blox&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=soci">practiced in full Wednesday</a>, so it looks like he will make his return and relegate Brian Hoyer to the bench as the Colts take on Jacksonville on Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 11 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/ob2l6y92sylb1aavyt6fu6evw">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1ink24648r3za1gkam0igv3ff9">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1k2ogltnjx2se1la6u4i3dbbtl">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Brissett's return is good for the Colts' offensive attack, ensuring you can start Marlon Mack with no reservations. Injuries have the rest of the receiving corps in a to-be-determined state -- T.Y. Hilton, Devin Funchess and Jack Doyle are all question marks for Sunday.</p>
