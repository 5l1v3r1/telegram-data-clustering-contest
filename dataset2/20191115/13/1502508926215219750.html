      <p>The Punjab government has disbursed Rs 19 crore among 29,343 non-basmati cultivating small and marginal farmers who did not burn paddy residue, a senior official said on Friday.</p>
      <p>The government has decided to give Rs 2,500 per acre as compensation to small and marginal farmers who have refrained from burning paddy straw, a major contributor to air pollution in the region.</p>
      <p>Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said the compensation has been released directly to the bank accounts of the farmers as per the list supplied by the field officers.</p>
      <p>As many as 85,000 applications have been received till now, Pannu said, adding the last date for submission of these applications is November 30.</p>
      <p>"Every application has to be verified by village panchayat and then by revenue authorities to ensure that only the non-basmati cultivating farming families owning land up to 5 acres and having not burnt any part of the field, are recommended for compensation," he said in an official release.</p>
      <p>Pannu warned that any sarpanch or revenue officer wrongly recommending any applicant would face stern action.</p>
      <p>He also cautioned that farmers giving wrong undertaking to seek compensation would also face action for fraudulently claiming the public money.</p>
