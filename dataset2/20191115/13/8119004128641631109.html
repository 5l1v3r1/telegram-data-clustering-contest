        <b>A Rohingya man with alleged ties to crimes has been killed in a so-called shootout with Border Guards Bangladesh in Cox’s Bazar’s Teknaf.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident took place at Hnila Union’s Leda early on Friday morning, said BGB Teknaf-2 Battalion Commander Lt Col Md Faisal Hassan Khan.</p>
      <p>The dead man has been identified as Nur Kabir, 28, hailed from Myanmar’s Rakhine State.</p>
      <p>“A BGB unit was patrolling the area when a group of drug traffickers opened fire on the troopers. The BGB men retaliated and at the end of the gunfight, a man was found lying on the ground with bullet-wounds,” said the BGB official.</p>
      <p>He was subsequently taken to the Cox’s Bazar Sadar Hospital where doctors declared him dead, he said.</p>
      <p>The BGB recovered 120,000 yaba pills, a gun and two rounds of bullets, according to Faisal. Two BGB troopers were also injured in the gunfight.</p>
