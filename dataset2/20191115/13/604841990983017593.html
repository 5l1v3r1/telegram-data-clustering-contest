      <p>Torro built on their impressive opening round victory over Park Celtic Summerhill in the NEFL Women's League by cruising to a 3-0 victory over Slane Wanderers at the MDL on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>Torro were pinned into their own half for the majority of the opening half as Slane dominated early on, but they defended superbly to maintain a cleansheet at half-time.</p>
      <p>After the break and with the wind at their backs Torro upped the tempo and launched wave after wave of attacks, but Slane proved difficult to break down as they looked to add to their opening round win over Kingscourt Harps with another victory.</p>
      <p>Aoife McCluskey went close to breaking the deadlock when she hit the post, but she didn't have to wait long before opening the scoring with a left-footed strike.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the restart Kim Potts went close to restoring parity, but some excellent goalkeeping kept her out.</p>
      <p>Laura Mathews added to her two-goal salvo from last week's win with another fine strike to make it 2-0 and almost immediately she added her fourth of the season with a stunning lob from midfield.</p>
      <p>Slane pressed hard to get back into the game, but with Avril McKenna in fine form Torro held firm.</p>
