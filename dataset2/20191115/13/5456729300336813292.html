      <p>Gunmen Thursday night stormed Modibbo Adamawa University of Technology (MAUTECH), Yola, and kidnapped a professor, T Illesanmi of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning.</p>
      <p>A witness, Na’omi Baba, said the gunmen seized the don at the university’s main campus and whisked him away.</p>
      <p>Confirming the incident, police spokesperson in the state, Sulaiman Nguroje, said the police were on the trail of the kidnappers.</p>
      <p>“We received a distress call around midnight on Thursday that the professor was kidnapped right inside the professor’s quarters in the university.</p>
      <p>“We immediately deployed our intelligence unit to the area and are working to ensure that the culprits are arrested and the victim rescued,” Mr Nguroje said.</p>
      <p>Recently, a professor in the same university, Adamu Zata, was kidnapped by unknown gunmen. About a year earlier, Mr Zata had also been kidnapped and released after payment of a N2 million ransom.</p>
      <p>The family of Mr Zata reportedly paid another N2 million ransom before he was released from his second abduction.</p>
