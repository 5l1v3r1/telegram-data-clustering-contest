      <h1>Netflix Responds To Mo'Nique's Race/Gender Discrimination Lawsuit</h1>

      <p>Wanda Sykes also felt undervalued before renegotiating with the global media corporation.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Mo'Nique finally sued Netflix in Los Angeles County Superior Court over what she perceives to be discriminatory actions by the streaming giant. The Oscar-winning actress claims the company proposed a low-ball stand-up special deal compared to other comedians.</p>
      <p>“When the talent was not a Black woman, Netflix offered to pay, and did pay, astronomically more than it pays to Black women like it offered to Mo'Nique," reads the suit. </p>
      <p>She was supposedly presented $500,000 as a “talent fee" in comparison to multi-million dollar offers for men and white women. Jerry Seinfeld ($100 million), Dave Chapelle ($60 million), Chris Rock ($40 million), Ricky Gervais ($40 million), and Amy Schumer ($13 million) were reportedly given much higher financial terms.</p>
      <p>Mo also accused Netflix of lacking racial diversity in executive positions and not responding fast enough when <i>House of Cards</i> actor Kevin Spacey and Chief Communications Officer Jonathan Friedland allegedly used racist language. Netflix is denying Mo'Nique's allegations of race and gender discrimination.</p>
      <p>"We care deeply about inclusion, equity, and diversity and take any accusations of discrimination very seriously," a Netflix spokesperson told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/actress-mo-nique-suing-netflix-race-gender-discrimination-n1081436">NBC News</a>. "We believe our opening offer to Mo'Nique was fair — which is why we will be fighting this lawsuit."</p>
      <p>In 2018, Mo'Nique called on her Instagram followers to boycott Netflix for color and gender bias. The star of <i>The Parkers</i>, <i>Precious</i>, and<i> Bessie </i>posted a video explaining why she was asking her fans to stop supporting the home of <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>, <i>Stranger Things</i>, <i>Top Boy</i>, <i>When They See Us</i>,<i> Dear White People</i>, <i>Rapture</i>, <i>Hip-Hop Evolution</i>, <i>Rhythm + Flow</i>, and other programs.</p>
      <p>Fellow Black comedienne Wanda Sykes spoke out in support of Mo’Nique last year by revealing she also rejected an inadequate deal from Netflix. However, the Emmy winner eventually released her <i>Not Normal</i> comedy special on the platform after<a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/wanda-sykes-netflix-special-comedy-silicon-valleywood-1203195861/"> "they moved that comma."</a></p>
