      <h1>Calgary's Jocelyn Alice finds strength in loss on defiant debut album, How Dare You</h1>

      <p>Jocelyn Alice was not being subtle when she chose the name.</p>
      <p>In the news release announcing her vibrant, 11-song debut album, How Dare You, Alice makes cryptic reference to the title being inspired by a conversation with a friend: “She just knows me. She knows you can’t tell me what to do,” Alice explains.</p>
      <p>In broader strokes, the fierce moniker suggests frustration and defiance, both of which the Calgary-born singer confirms have been drivers in her career for the past five years.</p>

      <p>While signed to Sony, she spent time in Nashville, Toronto, and, most recently, Los Angeles. In what is fairly typical for up-and-coming pop prospects, label brass had her collaborating with numerous songwriters in those cities. The sessions were educational, but many of those songs never saw the light of day. Sony released a few singles. Her debut EP, Little Devil, came out in September 2018. But a full-length debut seemed to be forever on hold. Alice stresses that Sony was good to her. But How Dare You’s reggae-spiced opener Papers suggests frustration with major-label contracts and the expectations that come with them. In the world of major-label pop music, decisions tend to be made by committee. Timing is everything and it seemed as if the timing for a Jocelyn Alice major label debut was never quite right.</p>
      <p>So she left.</p>
      <p>“I waited a long time,” she says, in an interview with Postmedia from Los Angeles. “I tried to stay. I wanted to stay. It came to a point where things weren’t adding up and it didn’t seem natural.”</p>
      <p>So Alice signed with AWAL, an indie-label subsidiary of U.K. publishing powerhouse Kobalt Music that allows its artists full creative control. At the time of this interview, she was also preparing to leave Los Angeles and come back home.</p>

      <p>“It’s extra exciting for me because I’m back to being indie and back to doing things the way I want do to them and the way that matters to me as an artist and as a human being,” says Alice, who will be headlining the Grey Cup Festival’s outdoor TD Stage on Nov. 21. “I think it’s fitting. Of course, the first big album coming out has to be done my way.”</p>
      <p>Which is not to say How Dare You, which lands Nov. 22, springs exclusively from Alice’s artistic vision. There are plenty of collaborations on the album. The aforementioned Papers was co-written and co-produced by Calgary synth-pop artist Hello Moth, who first partnered with Alice back in 2015 on her breakout hit Jackpot. Nashville singer Rayelle, a longtime friend, is featured on the slinky mid-tempo pop tune Spin Cycle. Electronic artist and DJ Tep No collaborated on the chill Summer Nights. Alice originally wrote the organ-sweetened acoustic ballad Tired for Ontario folky Nefe, who applies her powerful pipes to the tune as a duet. Ryan Marshall, a.k.a. Marshall, of Walk Off the Earth, co-produces and sings on the soul-grooved ballad Chit Chat Chatter. So this wasn’t a matter of a pop starlet stuffing her debut with marquee names. Most of the collaborations were organic and often the culmination of years of friendship.</p>
      <p>“It’s an incredible feeling to get to support the artists that supported me,” Alice says. “Hello Moth was the producer of Jackpot and he’s the reason I have a career at all. Marshall from Walk Off the Earth has been producing half of my album and it only felt right to give him that opportunity to also sing on it. Rayelle is one of my closest friends in the world and was basically the person who taught me how to write a song. All of these people I’ve known for many, many years and they are close in my circle.”</p>
      <p>While she may be intent on blazing her own trail, it’s certainly not surprising that Sony saw a gold mine of mainstream potential in Alice. Showcasing her soulful vocals and Hello Moth’s icy synth work, Jackpot was one of those out-of-the-gate, career-defining triumphs that immediately catapulted Alice to next-big-thing status and made a followup seem almost impossible. It went platinum in Canada, hit the Top 10 in Spotify’s U.S. viral charts and remained a Top 20 tune for 15 consecutive weeks.  </p>
      <p>But while many of the songs on How Dare You are bright and undeniably catchy, they also harbour some pressing darkness. The searing and appropriately named ballad The Dark, for instance, seems to veer from anguished to defiant thanks to Alice’s powerful phrasing.</p>
      <p>Loss and grief have always been underlying components of her output.</p>
      <p>“Lyrically, it’s definitely about surviving but it’s more about the struggle itself,”  she says. </p>
      <p>On that note, she admits there was more than a little anxiety involved when it came to figuring out how to follow up a platinum debut  and then navigating the peculiar career arc of signing to and then leaving a major label.</p>
      <p>But the pressures have not all been professional. Within the last four years, she lost both her maternal grandparents. When she was 12, her best friend died. Three other friends perished since she has been in junior high. One of her first boyfriends also passed away. Meanwhile, her childhood in Calgary was “not fun, dramatic and unsteady.” It’s all part of what she calls her “weird story.”</p>
      <p> “It’s definitely been a roller-coaster life for me in terms of emotions,” she says. “When you add on the fact that I’m already an incredibly emotional person, it’s a lot sometimes. I think that’s exactly how it should be because I was given this place that I can hopefully create something beautiful that really wasn’t in the moment. I’m going through a breakup right now, so that’s another loss. That’s really foundation-crumbling in a lot of ways and you have to rebuild yourself back up. But when you go through that enough times in your life, you have that faith and you know that you can do it. I have this new strength, thanks to all those losses.”</p>
