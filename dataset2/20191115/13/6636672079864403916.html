      <p>What topics have caught your interest? As is often the case, the Raspberry Pi leads the way, but an AI processor previously developed in stealth mode is there, along with an ARM commitment to its UK headcount and the end of the road for Samsung’s Exynos…</p>

      <p><b>5.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/back-arm-samsungs-exynos-2019-11/">Back to Arm for Samsung’s Exynos</a><br/>After ending its US custom core design effort for Exynos processors, Samsung is expected to return to using Arm cores. “Samsung has decided to transition part of our US-based R&amp;D teams in Austin and San Jose,” says Samsung. It is thought that around 290 jobs will be lost. It is believed that Samsung has not found external customers for Exynos.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/products/micros/ai-processor-task-parallel-thread-parallel-2019-11/">AI processor is task parallel and thread parallel</a><br/>Californian chip-maker Blaize has emerged from stealth development with a processor aimed at artificial intelligence. Until recently called Thinci, the El Dorado Hills firm describes its product as “the first true graph-native silicon architecture and software platform built to process neural networks and enable AI applications with unprecedented efficiency”. Unfortunately: “we are not disclosing any metrics yet”, Blaize v-p of operations told Electronics Weekly, so there is nothing available to quantify these claims.</p>

      <p><b>3.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/marvell-thunderx2-microsofts-cloud-2019-11/">Marvell ThunderX2 chosen for Microsoft’s open-source cloud design</a><br/>Marvell has announced that Microsoft is now deploying internal, production-level servers for Microsoft Azure based on its ThunderX2 server processor portfolio. Marvell has collaborated with Microsoft and Ingrasys on the design and implementation of the ThunderX2 platform that is compliant with Project Olympus, Microsoft’s next cloud hardware design. The Project Olympus platform is open-sourced through the open compute project (OCP). Marvell’s collaboration with Microsoft began at the OCP U.S. Summit in March 2017.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/arm-stands-commitment-double-uk-headcount-2019-11/">Despite losses Arm stands by commitment to double UK headcount</a><br/>Arm CEO Simon Segars (pictured) says the company will meet the commitment to double its UK headcount made when Softbank bought Arm in July 2016. The commitment still stands despite Arm becoming loss-making. In Q3 Arm made an operating loss of $11.3 million while Softbank made a loss of $6.4 billion. Arm’s Q3 revenues fell 13% to $396 million.</p>

      <p><b>1. <a href="https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/overclocked-net-booting-power-sipping-raspberry-pi-4-2019-11/">Now over-clocked, net-booting and power-sipping – the Raspberry Pi 4</a></b><br/>It has now been a few months since the launch of the Raspberry Pi 4, writes Jenny List on <i>Hackaday</i>. While significantly faster than the Pi 3 on paper, its propensity for overheating would end up throttling down the CPU clock even with the plethora of heatsinks and fans. Raspberry Pi have been working on solutions and they have now released a set of updates. (UPDATE: Here’s the download page and release notes)</p>
