      <p>A paramedic responding to an emergency returned to her ambulance to find a rude not stuck to the window - ranting that she had blocked someone's driveway.</p>
      <p>Lauren Wheeler posted a picture of the abusive message to Facebook.</p>
      <p>It reads: "Don't care if you're an ambulance you can't block people's driveways! Either ask or f***ing come out when we beep the horn for 10 minutes."</p>
      <p>Lauren, from Harlow, Essex, wrote on her post: “Love getting cute notes in my job" with a laughing crying emoji, writes <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/paramedic-finds-disgusting-note-ambulance-20888097">MirrorOnline</a> .</p>
      <p>One Facebook user responded: "Oh my god that’s disgusting!!!" and another wrote: "Wow, really got time to knock and ask or just pop out while possibly trying to save someone’s life!"</p>
      <p>A third added: "He may need you one day!!!"</p>
      <p>The incident is believed to have happened in Southend-on-Sea.</p>
      <p>In August, an abusive note was left on the windscreen of an ambulance parked in Luton calling the paramedics “blind idiots”.</p>
      <p>In December last year, an ambulance in Manchester was left with an abusive note filled with expletives.</p>
      <p>A North West Ambulance Service spokeswoman said "our patients are our number one priority".</p>
