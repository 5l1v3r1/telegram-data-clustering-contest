      <p>WASHINGTON: A gathering of conservative lawyers gave US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a rapturous reception on Thursday (Nov 14) for an upbeat speech in his first major public appearance since sexual misconduct accusations almost derailed his appointment. </p>
      <p>Appointed last year to the high court by Republican President Donald Trump, Kavanaugh addressed the annual meeting of the conservative Federalist Society at Washington's Union Station.</p>

      <p>Protesters outside carried signs reading "Impeach Kavanaugh" and chanted as dinner attendees in evening clothes waited to enter. Some protesters with whistles briefly disrupted his speech.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh thanked friends who stood by him during the contentious confirmation process and appeared emotional when mentioning his wife and daughters.</p>
      <p>In a speech chiefly light in tone, scattered with jokes and sports references, Kavanaugh praised his fellow eight justices on the Supreme Court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, referring to the group as a "team of nine".</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh described Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes criticized by conservatives despite his strong conservative record, as "superb and wise."</p>
      <p>He thanked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court's most prominent liberal, for "being so generous to me".</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh did not mention Trump or directly refer to the accusations the judge had faced.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old conservative jurist was confirmed in October 2018 on a 50-48 vote in a US Senate controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans.</p>
      <p>The vote came after Kavanaugh angrily denied accusations by a California university professor, Christine Blasey Ford, that he had sexually assaulted her in 1982 when the two were high school students in Maryland.</p>
      <p>"Last year a lot of my friends put themselves on the line for me. People risked their jobs and livelihoods. They were yelled at, insulted and threatened," Kavanaugh said.</p>
      <p>"My friends paid a heavy price. A way too heavy price," he added.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh's affable demeanour during oral arguments at the court contrasted with his incensed testimony during televised confirmation hearings in September 2018, when he accused Democrats of orchestrating a hit job against him.</p>
      <p>In addition to Ford, two women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct dating to the 1980s. He denied all the accusations.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh's record in his first year has shown him to be mostly in lock step with his fellow rightward-leaning justices.</p>
      <p>The court will decide in coming weeks whether to hear Trump's bid to keep his tax records from being handed over to a New York prosecutor.</p>
