      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/south-park"><i>South Park</i></a> creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker have been accused of transphobia after mocking <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/transgender">trans</a> athletes in the show’s latest episode.</p>
      <p>The 23rd season’s seventh episode focused on the character Strong Woman, who can be seen entering a Strongwoman Competition alongside a new character named Heather Swanson.</p>
      <p>Swanson bears a striking resemblance to late wrestler Randy Savage, who died in 2011 and, when asked why they’re competing, she says she only started identifying as a female a few weeks ago in order to compete.</p>
      <p>“I’m not here to talk about my transition, I’m here to kick some f***ing ass,” she says, before winning the competition.</p>
      <p>It’s revealed at the end of the episode that this character is actually an ex-boyfriend of Strong Woman, who he wants to beat in revenge for a bad break-up.</p>
      <p>Transgender world track cycling champion <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/rachel-mckinnon-transgender-cyclist-interview-unfair-womens-sport-a9161241.html">Rachel McKinnon</a> criticised the episode on Twitter, calling it “lazy” and “transphobic”.</p>
      <p>“I’m not particularly mad about the <i>South Park</i> episode,” she said. “Yes it’s transphobic. Yes it’s lazy. Yes it contributes to harm to trans women and girls. But they’re lazy and increasingly irrelevant. F***, <i>Futurama</i> made the same stupid storyline in 2003. Transphobes don’t have new jokes.” </p>
      <p>She added: ”<i>South Park</i> has been deeply transphobic the *entire time.* This isn’t their first explicitly transphobic story line. It won’t be their last. Stone and Parker are transphobes. Write them off. Ignore their lazy show.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, McKinnon became the first trans athlete to win a track world title at the women’s <a href="http://www.cyclingmasters.com/site/">World Masters Track Cycling Championship</a> in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/California">California</a>.</p>
