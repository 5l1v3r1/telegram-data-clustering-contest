      <h1>Hear It Live: Marshall Burns' dark humour reflected in 'Dead and Gone'</h1>
      <h2>On the new record Dogs &amp; Booze, “Dead and Gone” is Marshall Burns' duet with Kacy Anderson of Kacy &amp; Clayton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:51+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lpashleym" target="_blank">Ashley Martin</a></address>
      <p>Hear It Live is a closer look at a song and its writer/performer. Hear “Dead and Gone” when Marshall Burns performs next week in Regina.</p>
      <h3>The artist</h3>
      <p>Marshall Burns is a familiar face in the Regina music scene. Since he first played a Regina Folk Festival tweener set at age 13, the guitar-playing songwriter has been performing around town.</p>
      <p>In Grade 12, he co-founded indie rock band Rah Rah, which had a solid 10-year run before its 2016 hiatus.</p>
      <p>Burns plays classic country music with The Alley Dawgs every Tuesday night at the Fat Badger. (A 600-song cover rotation makes repeats rare. “We have a lot of regulars who come every week or most every week. So we try to make sure that we’re keeping the show entertaining … and different every time for them.”)</p>
      <p>And now, Burns has got a solo record — his first one ever, if you can believe it.</p>
      <p>Producing a solo record was different from his previous experience with bands.</p>
      <p>“It’s your name; it’s your project; you’re lining everybody up to do this and make it come to life,” said Burns.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice at times to have final say and have more control. And then at other times, that’s a challenge too because it’s ultimately on you to get things done. … Things weren’t being split up between a five-person band.”</p>

      <h3>The song</h3>
      <p>On the record Dogs &amp; Booze, “Dead and Gone” is a duet with Kacy Anderson of cousin-duo Kacy &amp; Clayton.</p>
      <p>It’s a song about two fictional characters, a long-time couple, elderly and “extremely unhappy.”</p>
      <p>“I thought that was kind of unique; I feel like I haven’t heard this story before in song necessarily,” said Burns. “When you’re writing, you’re trying to do something that you feel you haven’t seen done quite that same way. And that’s generally what drives you to want to create something.”</p>
      <p>Burns enjoys storytelling, and this is a story-song.</p>
      <h3>The words</h3>
      <p>A man notices his wife “tiring of my stories” and “growing cold.”</p>
      <p>“You’re waiting out your days, too tired to make any changes,” the song continues. “Steadfast in your ways and yet closed off to all exchanges.”</p>
      <p>The chorus goes, “So here we are together, but quite alone. My darling’s living for that day I’m dead and gone.”</p>
      <p>The lyrics draw on a “dark humour” that Burns enjoys about songwriting.</p>
      <p>“It’s a little over the top intentionally. I hope there’s not too many people lying there next to their partner, hoping that they’re dead and gone,” said Burns.</p>
      <p>More so, it’s about “feeling incapable of changing your surroundings,” he added. “Your hands are tied in life and you’re in a position that you don’t necessarily want to be in, but you aren’t sure how to break out of that.”</p>
      <h3>Listen now</h3>
      <p>As with Burns’ other music, Dogs &amp; Booze will be available on streaming services upon its release.</p>
      <p>Many of the songs date back to Burns’ time with The Lonesome Weekends, a country band active in Regina a decade ago.</p>
      <p>The album was recorded three years ago — with Jeff Romanyk (drums), Joel Passmore (bass), Chris Sleightholm (guitar) and Ian Cameron (pedal steel) — and took this long to mix and finalize.</p>
      <p>These past few years, Burns got a full-time job “and music wasn’t the only thing that I was focused on like it had been. So that kind of slowed down the whole process.”</p>
      <h3>Hear it live</h3>
      <p>Burns has scheduled two album release shows at The Artesian in Regina on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and Thursday, Nov. 21. (The first show sold out quickly, hence the call to add the second. Both nights start at 7:30 p.m.)</p>
      <p>Backing Burns in concert are Romanyk, Cameron, Sleightholm and Andy Beisel.</p>
      <p>Lexi Buzash of Suncliffs will open.</p>
