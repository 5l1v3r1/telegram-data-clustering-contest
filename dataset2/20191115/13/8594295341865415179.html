      <blockquote>Good day Sajeev,<br/><br/>I am contemplating doing something I never thought I would… buying a GM product. A used GM! I have recently negotiated the purchase of a home which will result in me commuting roughly 30 km to work, one-way. Now, that doesn’t seem like a whole lot, considering it will be mostly highway, but it is roughly 10 times as long as my current commute. My 2009 Focus is getting shabby, and although it has proven to be exceptionally reliable, age and road salt is taking its toll on the bodywork. So in light of this, I have decided it is time to find my next vehicle.<br/><br/>I was positively inclined toward the Cruze as soon as it came out. When I read its diesel made not a whole lot less torque than my old 5.0 LX, I was shocked. For me, the gutlessness of four-cylinder engines is something that truly destroys the enjoyability of any vehicle afflicted with one. I guess that old 302 loping down the road spoiled me for effortless engine response, despite it being nothing special nowadays in terms of output.<br/><br/>I am thinking this 2.0 turbo oil burner might provide the best of both worlds at a reasonable buy-in. Do you or anyone on the board have any experience with the Cruze Diesel in terms or reliability, durability and general liveability? This would break my streak of buying five Ford products in a row. The Cruze Diesel in question is a 2014 with 80K, no rust, leather, yadda-yadda….The diesel engine premium seems to have been eaten by the first owner, as the price seems in line with gas Cruzes of the same age.<br/><br/>Has this engine/transmission proven reliable over the long haul?</blockquote>

      <p>How funny: years ago I felt a similar connection when my 5.0 HO Fox Body Cougar sat next to my then-girlfriend’s Jetta TDI. I occasionally, fondly remember the gutsy Vee-Dub (ironically traded-in on a 2008 Focus),<i> but I digress…</i></p>
      <p>Aside from assorted complaints about Chevy dealers, I see few (if any) worrying trends regarding <a href="https://www.cruzetalk.com/forums/gen1-diesel-technical-discussion.201/">Diesel Cruze problems</a>. So find your future go-to repair shop based on the expertise of their diesel technicians. Both independent shops and dealers can have good diesel techs, but you gotta do the legwork to find them.</p>
      <p>And like all ubiquitous automotive cockroaches with aftermarket alternatives, I reckon you will save metric tons of money buying non-diesel specific Cruze parts online.</p>
      <p>Aside from the aforementioned local diesel technician concern, I see no reason to not buy a Diesel Cruze. Matter of fact, I’m kinda thinking — <i>since we have similar taste in vehicles </i>— that I shoulda bought one instead of my 2011 Ranger. Nah, the Ranger’s <i>somewhat Cruze-adjacent</i> after doing aftermarket torque boosting and ride comfort enhancements.</p>
      <p>So get the Cruze Diesel, unless you can’t bear to break your Ford-buying streak. What say you, Best and Brightest?</p>
