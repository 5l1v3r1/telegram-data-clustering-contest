      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:58:48+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>A bride-to-be has left people horrified by the state of her "disease-ridden bacteria-filled" nails after sharing a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/engagement-ring">ring</a> photo.</p>
      <p>The picture shows a silver ring with a huge diamond in the middle as well as other smaller diamonds around the twisted band.</p>
      <p>But people seemed disinterested in the ring and instead appeared to be distracted by what was 'living under' her nails.</p>
      <p>One said they looked like they were filled with bacteria, claiming the photo had made her sick in her mouth, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10351218/bride-rinsed-bacteria-filled-nails-engagement-ring/">The Sun reports.</a></p>
      <p>It's thought the photo was sent to a friend who posted it on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>One harsh critic said: "I threw up in my mouth when I saw those hideous disease-ridden, bacteria-filled nails."</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "Why people just why? Your eyes can't see that nail bacterial smorgasbord as you posted that atrocious ring.</p>
      <p>"Bleach and toothbrush RIGHT NOW."</p>
      <p>The criticism continued, with one saying: "Ew to the ring and what is living under her nail."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Mirror Online reported on another bride-to-be's unusual engagement ring which was compared to a "pair of tweezers" and a "taser gun".</p>

      <p>Close up photos of the ring were shared in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group "That's It, I'm Ring Shaming", with the caption "A ring only 'slightly acceptable' from one angle".</p>
      <p>The unusual 'V' angle design garnered mixed reactions from users, and many were quick to lash out.</p>
      <p>One said: "Oh no. Its colours donâ€™t even match!"</p>
