        <b>Apple is removing all vaping apps from its online store.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It said it had taken the decision because of growing official concerns about the impact vaping can have on health.</p>
      <p>In the US, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html">42 deaths and more than 2,100 cases of lung injury</a> have been linked to a respiratory illness tied to vaping.</p>
      <p>Apple's decision means a total of 181 apps will not be available on iPhones, <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html">reports tech news site Axios.</a></p>
      <h3>Harmful agent</h3>
      <p>In a statement given to Axios, Apple said it agreed with official warnings about the negative health impacts of vaping and the potential problem presented by the appeal of e-cigarettes to the young.</p>
      <p>It said it took "great care" to ensure that the app store was a place people could trust to get programs for their iPhone.</p>
      <p>The vaping apps available via Apple's store let people exercise control of some features of e-cigarettes and others simply kept people up to date with news about vaping or offered themed games.</p>
      <p>Apple said anyone who already had a vaping app on their iPhone would be able to continue using it and transfer it to any new Apple device.</p>
      <p>The move to eliminate vaping apps began in June when Apple decided to stop accepting any new apps related to e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Research by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into the causes of the respiratory disease that caused the deaths suggests one ingredient is to blame.</p>
      <p>The CDC said it had found vitamin E acetate - a thickening agent used in many illegal vaping products - in lung samples from 29 patients hit by the disease.</p>
