        <b>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has proved he’s simply not bothered <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/people-think-dwayne-rock-johnson-died-11150462/">by the recent death hoax</a>, sharing the sweetest video with his pal Lin Manuel Miranda.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s gonna take more than that to ruffle his feathers.</p>
      <p>The star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/dwayne-rock-johnson-unveiled-superhero-black-adam-joins-dc-universe-amid-death-hoax-11144151/">who has just been revealed as superhero Black Adam as he joins the DC Universe</a>, retweeted a video of the pair of them belting out You’re Welcome from Moana at the movie’s world premiere.</p>
      <p>A true classic.</p>
      <p>‘Hold my tequila, while my friend and I sing this little ditty, You’re Welcome,’ the 47-year-old wrote. ‘And thank you. Always a blast entertaining with the maestro @Lin_Manuel.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mary Poppins Returns star Lin oozed confidence as he wrote: ‘No rehearsal? No problem. We got @TheRock! #Tbt.’</p>
      <p>Absolute pros, the both of them.</p>
      <p>However, it’s not exactly been a smooth couple of days for the actor and wrestler,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/no-dwayne-rock-johnson-isnt-dead-stunt-accident-just-victim-death-hoax-11124819/"> after fans were sent into meltdown by a fake news story that claimed he was dead.</a></p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The hoax story’s headline read: ‘BBC: Dwayne The Rock Johnson Dies at 47 after a terrible stunt attempted failed’, and quickly circulated around Facebook.</p>
      <p>Despite using the BBC in the headline, the link would take users to a fake website rather than the legitimate news source, and there is no story about The Rock being dead on the BBC.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time Dwayne has been the target of a death hoax – the Fast And Furious star was also declared dead by trolls in 2011 and 2014.</p>
      <p>In 2011, he responded to the rumours on his Facebook page, telling fans: ‘Rumours of my death are false – I’m still “Bringin’ It” 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year – including leap year!’</p>
      <p>Big mood.</p>
      <p>And, as if our emotions weren’t high enough, the star also penned a sweet message about joining the DC Universe as the new superhero.</p>

      <p>Alongside a snap of himself decked out in his superhero finest, he told his 161 million followers: ‘The Man in Black. Like most kids growing up, I dreamed about being a superhero. Having cool superpowers, fighting for what’s right and always protecting the people.</p>
      <p>‘It all changed for me when I was 10yrs old and was first introduced to the greatest superhero of all time – SUPERMAN.</p>

      <p>‘As a kid, Superman was the hero I always wanted to be. But, a few years into my fantasy, I realised that Superman was the hero, I could never be.</p>

      <p>‘I was too rebellious. Too rambunctious. Too resistant to convention and authority. Despite my troubles, I was still a good kid with a good heart – I just liked to do things my way.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Now, years later as a man, with the same DNA I had as a kid – my superhero dreams have come true. I’m honoured to join the iconic #DCUniverse and it’s a true pleasure to become, BLACK ADAM.</p>
      <p>‘BLACK ADAM is blessed by magic with the powers equal to SUPERMAN, but the difference is he doesn’t toe the mark or walk the line.</p>
      <p>‘He’s a rebellious, one of a kind superhero, who’ll always do what’s right for the people – but he does it his way.’</p>
