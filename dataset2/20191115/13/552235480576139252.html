      <h1>Jail for addict who preyed on elderly, Perth Sheriff Court hears</h1>
      <h2>Stole from vulnerable to feed heroin habit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:49:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A heroin addict, who preyed on vulnerable pensioners in care homes and sheltered housing in Perth and Crieff to get cash to feed his habit, was jailed for eight months this week.</p>
      <p>Perth Sheriff Court was told the ages of his seven victims - both men and women - ranged from 74-91.</p>
      <p>Several had mobility issues while one suffers from dementia.</p>
      <p>Thirty-five-year-old Tomasz Lacki, of Murrayfield Loan, Crieff - himself a former carer - targeted the OAPs during his three-week crime spree.</p>
      <p>He used his knowledge of care homes across Perthshire to gain access to properties where residents should have expected privacy and safety.</p>
      <p>His catalogue of crime was committed at homes in Crieff’s Duchlage Court and Strathearn Court, as well as at Carpenter Court, Dewar Court and Bowerswell Cottages, all Perth, between August 31 and September 25.</p>
      <p>He admitted stealing a wallet and its contents from a flat in Carpenter Court and making off with a purse and its contents from Strathearn Court.</p>
      <p>The other offences related to him being found in the various properties in circumstances under which it might reasonably be assumed that he intended to commit theft there.</p>
      <p>Passing sentence, Sheriff William Wood told him: “The court is very troubled by the nature and number of those offences.”</p>
      <p>And he described it as “rather more than chance” that every house the accused had targeted contained either the elderly or infirm - or both.</p>
      <p>He added: “Only a custodial sentence is appropriate.”</p>

      <p>Depute fiscal Michael Sweeney said the ages of the victims were 74, 81, 86, 88, 89, 90 and 91.</p>
      <p>The 88-year-old male resident of Carpenter Court had left his red wallet, containing bank cards, in a drawer next to his armchair.</p>
      <p>But it went missing.</p>
      <p>CCTV was later viewed and the accused was seen entering the sheltered housing at about 1.40pm.</p>
      <p>An 81-year-old woman, who lives alone in Strathearn Court, had gone to the toilet.</p>
      <p>She then spotted the accused standing in the living room and told him to leave, which he did.</p>
      <p>She then discovered her purse, and £150 which was on a table beside it, had been stolen.</p>
      <p>Again the accused was traced through CCTV.</p>
      <p>Solicitor Billy Somerville said by pleading guilty his client had saved the victims giving evidence.</p>
      <p>A total of 31 witnesses had been cited for the trial.</p>
      <p>He maintained there hadn’t been “any level of planning” involved, although the accused had “engaged in a course of conduct.”</p>
      <p>“The lawyer added: “He recognises the impact on the victims.</p>
      <p>“He had lost his employment and had developed a [drug] habit.”</p>
      <p>He accepted that a background report indicated there was a “likelihood” of further offending by Lacki but asked the sheriff consider a Community Payback Order.</p>
      <p>That was rejected by Sheriff Wood who backdated the jail term to September 27, when the accused had first been remanded.</p>
      <p>The sheriff said there were services in prison - and in the community when he was released - which could help him tackle his addiction problem.</p>
