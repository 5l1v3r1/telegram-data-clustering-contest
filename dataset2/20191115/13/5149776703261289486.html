      <p>Forget the lights switch-on and Santa arriving at his grotto - the real countdown to Christmas will begin later this month when a Nottingham chippy once again launches its Yuletide special... foot-long battered pigs in blankets.</p>
      <p>The epic takeaway has become a festive tradition at Bestwood Fisheries, a fish and chip shop in Arnold Road, Bestwood.</p>
      <p>It will be the third year battered bangers wrapped in bacon have gone on sale - and the second for the super-size 1ft sausage.</p>
      <p>Co-owner Antoni Tsiolas, who mans the fryers with his cousin George Keliris, said: "They were really popular last year. We must have sold 1,300 in the one month we did them.</p>

      <p>"People have been asking all year round for them but over the past few weeks it's been more and more. It's like they know the time is near."</p>
      <p>The large sausages are wrapped in three rashers of smoked bacon, then dipped in batter and deep-fried for ten minutes.</p>
      <p>They will go on sale on Sunday, November 24.</p>
      <p>The chip shop doesn't usually trade on Sundays but will be opening specially for the next four weeks to sell the colossal Crimbo banger which is so big that the ends stick out of the polystyrene tray.</p>

      <p>Customers can have a six-inch pig for £2 or a foot-long one for £2.90. With chips and any sauce it's £4.20 or £5.</p>
      <p>And this year, to step it up a gear, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/nottinghams-top-kebab-takeaways-according-2556252">Bestwood Fisheries</a> will be introducing a giant Yorkshire pudding with battered pigs, chips and gravy inside.</p>
      <p>But it won't be going down the route of a famous London chippy, Poppie's Fish and Chips which is serving deep-fried battered Quality Street chocolates. "That doesn't sound good for the fryers," said: Antonio.</p>
      <p>Another chippy, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/first-look-around-new-cods-1232616">The Cod's Scallops</a> - which has branches in Bramcote Lane, Wollaton, Mansfield Road, Carrington and Tamworth Road, Long Eaton - will be offering two Christmas specials.</p>
      <p>Battered pigs in blankets and battered <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/tried-battered-brussels-sprouts-nottingham-2335342">Brussels sprouts</a> will be available from November 24 to December 24.</p>
