      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: David Johnson, Jordan Howard, David Montgomery, more Week 11 RB start/sit decisions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:04:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>David Johnson has probably been the bane of some fantasy football owners' existences this season, and heading into Week 11, there's probably still some injury to be worried about with him. Elsewhere in the RB rankings, Matt Breida probably won't play, and it's looking iffyfor Ty Johnson, too. Jordan Howard and David Montgomery both look more positive, although both are dealing with previously unknown injuries and will affect fantasy start-or-sit decisions. We have the latest updates below.</p>

      <h3>What's wrong with David Johnson?</h3>
      <p>Kliff Kingsbury told reporters after Sunday's game that Johnson has "<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28059999/cardinals-benched-david-johnson-keep-kenyan-drake-rolling-kliff-kingsbury-says">obviously</a>" been hampered by injuries in 2019. So, it's odd that Johnson wasn't on Wednesday's injury report out of Arizona. Johnson saw five carries and one target in Week 10 as he worked behind Kenyan Drake.</p>
      <p>Fantasy owners would probably like it better if Johnson would just be listed as out or something, but he should be on benches regardless in Week 11. You should probably avoid Drake against San Francisco, too, but he's the better play as it looks like Chase Edmonds (hamstring) will miss at least another week.</p>

      <h3>Jordan Howard injury update</h3>
      <p>Coming off the Eagles' bye, Howard <a href="https://twitter.com/DZangaroNBCS/status/1194724899136397313">was limited in Wednesday's practice</a> with a shoulder injury. It's an injury that wasn't known before the bye, so it's at least a little curious. The Eagles play at 4:25 p.m. ET in Week 11 against New England.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: Howard practiced again Thursday.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Howard probably is fine, although it's a little bit odd timing. Playing New England in Week 11 means you might want to look elsewhere anyway for RB production.</p>

      <h3>David Montgomery injury news</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Montgomery <a href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Campbell/status/1195101032608653313">missed practice</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Montgomery was on the injury report for the first time this season on Wednesday, when he was a limited participant in Bears' practice <a href="https://twitter.com/JJStankevitz/status/1195037780180635650">due to an ankle injury suffered</a> in practice. Chicago plays on Sunday night at the Rams in Week 11.</p>
      <p>Odds are Montgomery will be fine, and at least Matt Nagy has finally realized to give him the football -- 65 of the 86 RB touches for Chicago in the last three weeks have gone to the rookie. He's an RB2 for Week 11 if he plays. If he doesn't, Tarik Cohen and Ryan Nall would likely split RB rtouches.</p>

      <h3>Ty Johnson concussion update</h3>
      <p>Johnson <a href="https://twitter.com/Justin_Rogers/status/1195042576027570177">remains in the NFL's concussion protocol</a> after missing Detroit's Wednesday practice, but he <a href="https://twitter.com/Justin_Rogers/status/1195042576027570177">returned on Thursday</a> in at least a limited fashion. He would be the starting RB against Dallas if he plays;if he's out, J.D. McKissic will lead the Lions' backfield in touches.</p>
      <p>McKissic is a decent FLEX play, especially in PPR leagues, if Johnson is out. The whole Detroit offense will get a boost if Matthew Stafford plays, which is still up in the air.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEEK 11 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/ob2l6y92sylb1aavyt6fu6evw">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1ink24648r3za1gkam0igv3ff9">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-11-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1k2ogltnjx2se1la6u4i3dbbtl">Tight end</a></b>
      </p>
      <h3>Is Matt Breida playing Week 11?</h3>
      <p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1194686617245618176">Ian Rapoport reported</a> that Breida will be sidelined one or two weeks with an ankle injury, Breida missed Wednesday's San Francisco practice, as expected. Raheem Mostert steps into Breida's role alongside Tevin Coleman if Breida misses time.</p>
      <p>The 49ers play Arizona in Week 11, a great matchup to play Mostert as a FLEX option in fantasy leagues as he's likely to get double-digit touches in the Breida role.</p>
