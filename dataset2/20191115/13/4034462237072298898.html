      <h1>Driving New Hyundais Will Never Be The Same Again</h1>
      <h2>A new partnership means you can customize from the showroom.</h2>

      <p>Hyundai is on an absolute tear at the moment. The latest crossover additions, the tiny <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/kona">Kona</a> and the mid-size <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/palisade">Palisade</a>, have been well received. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/santa-fe">Santa Fe</a> and Tucson started out questionably when it came to quality, but have become solid performers over the latest generations. Hyundai has become a name to be reckoned with, and the next step for the South Korean automaker is to make sure the gaps usually filled by the aftermarket can be filled at the dealership. The answer to that is a new partnership with the accessory company Thule.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/honda-cr-v-transformed-into-two-weekend-warriors">active lifestyle is a big area of marketing for crossovers</a> and Thule has been a leader in everything to do with adventurous lifestyle for some time. The new partnership means Hyundai customers can now buy Thule's bike racks, roof racks, water and winter sport racks, as well as other cargo accessories, directly from Hyundai dealerships.</p>
      <p>"This partnership with Thule proves to be great timing as we simultaneously grow our line of SUVs, including newcomers such as the Hyundai Palisade and Hyundai Venue," said Mike O'Brien, vice president of Product, Corporate and Digital Planning for Hyundai Motor America.</p>

      <p>The "active lifestyle" is a sexy thing to market, despite the fact most crossovers are bought for commuting and family duties. Hyundai understands that, so it's not just bike and surf racks that are being offered. "Whether you go camping every weekend or need some extra space for your kid's soccer gear, Thule and Hyundai are making it simpler than ever for you to maximize your lifestyle with this new accessory partnership," says O'Brien, "Thule is the leader in this space and their lifetime warranty is a good match to our brand aspirations."</p>
      <p>The curated range of Thule accessories for Hyundai vehicles is available from dealers as of November 14.</p>
