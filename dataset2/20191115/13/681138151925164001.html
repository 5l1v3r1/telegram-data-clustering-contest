      <h1>Suffolk's Tory wets out campaigning in 2019 General Election</h1>

        <b>Those who remember Margaret Thatcher's time in Downing Street will remember the term "Tory Wets" which was used - at first - by some of her more enthusiastic followers to describe their more moderate colleagues.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the 1980s went on some people like Ken Clarke, Peter Walker and Jim Prior seemed to almost see the description as a badge of honour - and you still hear it used occasionally by Conservatives of a certain age either to have a dig at their internal opponents or to show that they don't really feel very extreme.</p>
      <p>But this week we've seen a new type of Tory Wet emerge across the country, including here in Suffolk - and I'm assured that none has been wetter than South Suffolk candidate James Cartlidge.</p>
      <p>He and a group of supporters, including Babergh leader John Ward, got soaked to the skin while canvassing in Long Melford on Thursday - and put this picture of themselves on Twitter to prove it!</p>
      <p>However Mr Cartlidge admitted that they had to wait until the rain eased before they took the picture. He said: "It might not have actually been pouring at that stage, but I can assure you we were all pretty wet!"</p>
