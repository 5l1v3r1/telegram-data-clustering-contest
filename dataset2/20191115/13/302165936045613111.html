      <p>PUTRAJAYA, Nov 15 — Malaysia and the Holy See can work together in areas where the concept of peaceful coexistence is important, said Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah.</p>
      <p>This, he said was raised with the outgoing Vatican ambassador to Malaysia, Archbishop Joseph Salvador Marino, that both could organise roundtable discussions and interfaith dialogues in the future.</p>
      <p>“This is not limiting the discussion on government-to-government relations but also brings in the civil society and religious groups like the Friendship Group for Inter-Religious Service. This is the kind of togetherness we need to uphold and promote,” he said.</p>
      <p>Saifuddin was speaking to reporters after the farewell hi-tea reception for the outgoing Vatican ambassador to Malaysia, hosted by Wisma Putra, here today.</p>
      <p>He said peaceful coexistence and harmonious relations among the Malaysian people is in the constitution but some people are misinterpreting this.</p>
      <p>Saifuddin said the constitution’s fundamentals were strong and gives sufficient platform for the Malaysian people of different faiths to live and work together.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Archbishop Joseph who has been in Malaysia for six and a half years, said the Holy See would continue to collaborate with Malaysia on mutual interest areas.</p>
      <p>He thanked the government and the Foreign Ministry for the courtesy and friendship during his tenure in representing the Holy See in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“People ask me what I will miss most about Malaysia. I said it is the people of Malaysia because in my experience during my stint in different countries, I find the Malaysian people truly gracious, kind, gentle, warm and welcoming with their lovely smiles,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the people of Malaysia should preserve and protect the peaceful coexistence where other religions have the right to worship despite the majority of the population being Muslims. — Bernama</p>
