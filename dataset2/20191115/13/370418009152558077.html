      <p>Fresh from <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/watch-dave-grohls-adorable-appearance-on-sesame-street/">an adorable appearance on Sesame Street</a>, it looks at though <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/dave-grohl/">Dave Grohl</a> is back in <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/foo-fighters/">Foo Fighters</a> mode, teasing what’s to come from the rock titans’ forthcoming album.</p>
      <p>While very little is known so far about the highly-anticipated follow-up to 2017’s Concrete And Gold, the frontman gave out a tiny nugget of information during an interview on the Blairing Out With Eric Blair Show at this past weekend’s Bowl For Ronnie event, admitting that it’s going to be “fucking weird”.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to give away too much, but… we’re, like, right in the middle of it right now,” he revealed. Ooooh…</p>

      <p>Of course, the making of Concrete And Gold was arguably pretty “fucking weird”, too, with <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/foo-fighters-how-dave-grohl-got-his-groove-back/">Dave telling Kerrang! ahead of its release</a> that he’d been holed up in a rented Airbnb on an olive tree farm, in a little town called Ojai, just outside of LA.</p>
      <p>“I just brought a guitar and microphone – and a case of wine!” he beamed. “I spent most of my time just singing things off of the top of my head. I wasn’t really playing the word game in a journal and cutting and pasting, like I had done before, but just really singing things unfiltered as I was drunk in my underwear.”</p>
      <p>He also pondered the situation of having an extensive discography, and trying to figure out what the band’s next steps would be: “It’s strange, because, after making a bunch of records, you kind of wonder where you’re going to tap into next, y’know? It’s kind of like hitting veins that aren’t there anymore.”</p>

      <p>Dave’s comments follow those of Foos drummer Taylor Hawkins, who <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/taylor-hawkins-dave-grohl-is-already-mapping-out-what-he-wants-the-next-record-to-be/">recently told Kerrang!</a> that the frontman is plotting a big 2020 – with potential plans to mark the 25th anniversary of the band’s self-titled debut, as well as working on a brand-new record.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of talk, and I think Dave is already mapping out what he wants the next record to be, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s something coming down the pipe,” he said. “I can’t 100 per cent spell it out for you for sure, because I’m always the last to know and I don’t want to give it away. But I would imagine there will be something made of the 25th year of the Foo Fighters, for sure. You know us, we never stop.”</p>
