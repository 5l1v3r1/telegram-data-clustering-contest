      <p>Investors are watching President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s approach to land reform as an indicator of his commitment to a reform agenda that carried him to a landslide election victory in April.</p>
      <p>Zelenskiy’s party is pushing legislation through parliament to remove a moratorium on the sale of agricultural land that has stood since 2001.</p>
      <p>It was a bold move in the face of protests inside and outside parliament, and drew qualified praise from the World Bank and the European Union.</p>
      <p>The government says it will add 2-3 percentage points to growth in its first year as it unleashes the pent-up potential of what is already one of the world’s biggest grain exporters.</p>
      <p>However, in answer to fears that foreigners will muscle out poorer Ukrainians in purchasing plots, Zelenskiy added a rider: the issue of whether foreigners could buy would be decided by referendum, and not before 2024.</p>
      <p>Alexander Rodnyansky, an economist at Britain’s Cambridge University and chief economic adviser to Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk’s government, said the move would be “detrimental to growth, our investment climate”.</p>
      <p>“If there is no foreign competition, local oligarchs are mechanically granted an advantage (or given a privilege) at obtaining land, especially because they are the least financially constrained and most powerful agents in the economy,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In fact, this policy structure is perfectly tailored for their needs; they can now buy land with the least possible competition.”</p>
      <p>Ukraine was also denying itself an opportunity to acquire foreign technology to raise farm productivity, he said:</p>
      <p>“China even has a mandatory technology transfer policy for foreign investors, which may have been an option too given the attractiveness of Ukraine’s agricultural sector.”</p>
      <p>Neither Zelenskiy nor Honcharuk’s office responded to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>But the bill that passed its first reading in parliament on Wednesday sets a minimum price for farmland and limits the area that can be accumulated by any one person or entity.</p>
      <p>While praising the reform on Wednesday, the EU said it was safeguards were needed to “avoid the excessive concentration of land in the hands of a few operators”.</p>
