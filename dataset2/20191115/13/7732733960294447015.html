      <h4>Something to look forward to: Microsoft’s Inside Xbox event is in full swing. One of the many announcements relates to the Xbox Game Pass, which will be receiving more than 50 new games over the next few months.</h4>
      <p>At the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82767-microsoft-annual-inside-xbox-event-goes-live-london.html">London event</a>, it was revealed that titles including Final Fantasy 7 through to 15, Rage 2, Flight Simulator, and Halo Reach are all coming to the PC version of the subscription service.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is also trying to tempt people onto its <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/80435-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-includes-pc-xbox-games.html">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> option, which combines the Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Live Gold, and access to the PC library, by offering it for $1 for the first three months.</p>
      <p>Additionally, all Game Pass Ultimate subscribers—not just new ones—will, starting from today, get one month of EA access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify premium. The Ultimate tier costs $14.99 per month, while Xbox Game Pass is $9.99 per month.</p>
