      <p>A £500 million fund pledged by the Tories to restore rail lines and stations axed in the 1960s “is not going to buy you very much”, a rail expert has warned.</p>
      <p>More than 5,000 miles of track and nearly 1,500 stations were closed between 1964 and 1970, following a report by British Railways chairman Dr Richard Beeching.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party has pledged to establish a Beeching Reversal Fund to restore services to “many of the towns cut off” from the rail network.</p>
      <p>But Sim Harris, managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews, said reopening many of the lines which fell victim to the Beeching cuts would cost “billions”.</p>
      <blockquote><b>1,434<br/></b>Stations closed between 1964 and 1970 after the Beeching Report</blockquote>
      <p>Asked about the £500 million fund, he told the PA news agency: “It is not going to buy you very much railway. A rebuilt railway costs millions for each kilometre.</p>
      <p>“It depends what’s happened to the railway since it closed. If it’s still there, and it’s a matter of upgrading and reopening a freight line, that is the cheaper option, but you’ve still got to spend money on the stations.</p>
      <p>“It would cost far more than that to really reverse Beeching.”</p>
      <p>Railway engineer Gareth Dennis said £500 million would cover the cost of reopening around 25 miles of track.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party listed four potential projects that could benefit from the fund, but did not provide further details on how the schemes would be financed.</p>
      <p>The candidates for a reopened or new line include: Ashington, Seaton Delaval and Blyth in Northumberland; Skelmersdale, Lancashire; Thornton-Cleveleys and Fleetwood in Lancashire; and Willenhall and Darlaston in the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>Labour’s shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald claimed the announcement “isn’t new”.</p>
      <p>In November 2017, then-transport secretary Chris Grayling said a new development programme would identify opportunities to restore some of the routes axed under Beeching.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonald said: “The Conservatives announced it two years ago to try to distract from the collapse of the East Coast franchise, which ultimately cost taxpayers £2 billion.</p>
      <p>“Unsurprisingly, not one of the Beeching cuts has been restored.</p>

      <p>In February, the Campaign for Better Transport urged the Government to invest £5 billion in adding 33 lines and 72 stations to the rail network through re-openings, new projects and running passenger trains on freight lines.</p>
      <p>It claimed this would bring more than half a million more people within walking distance of a station.</p>
      <p>There were 4,347 stations and 34,150 miles of track before the Beeching report was published in 1963. Now there are 2,566 stations and 19,319 miles of track.</p>
      <p>One of the last major re-openings of a line in Britain was the Borders Railway in September 2015.</p>
      <p>The £294 million link between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in the Scottish Borders re-established part of the former Waverley line, which fell victim to the Beeching cuts.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, Chiltern Railways began operating trains between London Marylebone and Oxford city centre on a newly established rail link, providing competition to Great Western Railway’s service between the cities.</p>
      <p>The £320 million project included upgrading an old 20-40mph branch line to a 100mph main line.</p>
