      <h2>"If you can bring the magic of Christmas to children with special needs in an environment that they can cope with, that's amazing."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:46:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:46</time> by <a rel="author">Gurjeet Nanrah</a></address>
      <p>A Nottinghamshire <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/charities">charity</a> will use a bus kitted out with sensory equipment as a mobile Santa's grotto to 'bring the magic of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>' to children with special educational needs.</p>
      <p>The Riley Foundation, based in Jacksdale, wants to make the festive period more inclusive of children with disabilities as the CEO's son, Riley Wilson, suffers from severe non-verbal autism and has "never had a successful visit" to see Santa.</p>
      <p>The bus has been wrapped in an eye-catching design to appeal to young children and will feature specialist sensory equipment onboard that will help create an autism-friendly environment.</p>
      <p>Some of the equipment on board will include lit-up interactive walls and floors that can make it appear to be snowing in the bus, a light-up ball pit, and fibre optic lighting.</p>

      <p>The family-run charity has a fundraising target of £25,000 - of which £7,000 has come from the National Lottery Community Fund. The charity is <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-riley-foundation?rcid=r01-156173897456-728f37376b234a8b&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m&amp;fbclid=IwAR0jQfLuTGwMtjXFHWUq9GOtatm16Ni-YDX5uQmeEWPiJx-tGnjRVclG2v0">still trying to raise a further £8,000 to meet its target.</a></p>
      <p>Melanie Shaw and Mark Wilson founded The Riley Foundation - named after their son - to help ensure special educational needs (SEN) children are not left out at public events and that their complex needs are met in schools.</p>
      <p>Melanie, who is 33 and CEO of the charity, said: "Riley, who is seven and a half now, has never had a successful visit to see Santa.</p>
      <p>"It hits a nerve and is something that we have all taken for granted. To actually realise that kids out there cannot be involved for one reason or another is so sad. that's why I think this is so important.</p>
      <p>"No children should miss out on the chance to visit Santa. If you can bring the magic of Christmas to children with special needs in an environment that they can cope with, that's amazing.</p>
      <p>"Particular problems children like Riley have when trying to do things like visit Santa include just queuing up and going in to sit with Santa. Riley finds it hard because he's non-verbal - as are around 40 percent of children with autism."</p>
      <p>Riley has other complex disorders that affect him such as sensory processing disorder, anxiety, sleeping disorder and ADHD.</p>
      <p>The sensory equipment is due to be installed in the bus by the beginning of December by SpaceKraft, a specialist firm who deal with installing this type of equipment in Shipley, West Yorkshire.</p>

      <p>The Riley Foundation has a few Christmas dates already lined up where it will visit Matlock Christmas Fair on December 21-22 and Riley's school in Long Eaton, Brakenfield Special School, on December 18.</p>
      <p>The charity aims to create an environment where SEN children can feel comfortable by giving parents alloted time slots to avoid the children having to queue up for long periods, allowing them to have plenty of time to explore the bus.</p>
      <p>They will also ensure Santa and his elves are all autism-trained.</p>
      <p>Mark, 54, added: "We want to create a friendly environment for the children.</p>
      <p>"In the grotto, the immersive floor can be set to make it look like it is snowing inside and the children can make snow angels."</p>

      <p>The exterior of the bus was wrapped by a Nottingham-based company last month.</p>
      <p>Paul Atherton, 31, who lives in Wilford, and is managing director of N1 Visual Solutions said: "We wanted the bus to be bright and eye catching for The Riley Foundation and I think we've been able to show on the outside what they aim to achieve with the bus.</p>
      <p>"I think it's so great and important what they are trying to achieve and I have family members who have SEN children so I really wanted to help with this."</p>
      <p>The charity will use the bus in the long-term at events such as the Riverside Festival and Armed Forces Day events to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/family-run-charity-ashfield-plans-3246071">ensure there is something on offer for SEN children</a> and at schools where children need this specialist equipment.</p>
