      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:15:10+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star James Haskell found himself locked in a high-profile battle with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> over a fake news story which claimed he'd died from a steroid overdose.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Haskell, 34, was targeted scammers who published damaging slurs about the rugby star on the social networking site.</p>
      <p>The false story was posted under the guise of a fake sports nutrition company, earning money through ad click-throughs.</p>
      <p>In the disturbing posts, shared from a location in Panama, it was claimed Haskell had died from a steroid overdose, alleging he had "committed suicide" and was a "drugs cheat".</p>
      <p>Haskell got in touch with Facebook and asked the company to remove the fake posts, and filmed a video to publicly refute the claims.</p>
      <p>In the clip, he said: "I am not dead and for those of you who wish I was dead, better luck next time.”</p>

      <p>Reports published at the time in 2017 suggested Facebook bosses had taken down the posts as soon as they were alerted.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the company said: "We will continue to work towards better transparency and accountability in our advertising products."</p>
      <p>Haskell's lawyer Matt Himsworth adde that the star was consideirng taking legal action against the social media giant, saying: “They just said they were not responsible.</p>
      <p>"We haven’t ruled out taking this further.”</p>
