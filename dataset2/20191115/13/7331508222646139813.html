      <h1>Week 11 NFL best bets: A number we like on each game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:25:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN Betting Insiders</a></address>
      <p>Each Friday during the NFL season, ESPN betting analysts Joe Fortenbaugh and Doug Kezirian, sports betting deputy editor David Bearman, Fantasy's Mike Clay and Matt Youmans of the Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network will tell us what they like from Sunday's NFL slate. (Note: Due to the uncertain status of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford">Matthew Stafford</a>, we do not currently have the Cowboys-Lions game up.)</p>

      <h4><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a> at <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> (-4, 50)</h4>
      <p><b>Youmans:</b> <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> is running and throwing his way into the MVP race with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a>. But let's not count out <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122840/deshaun-watson">Deshaun Watson</a>, who's at his best on the road. Since the beginning of the 2018 season, the Texans are 8-5 SU and 7-4-2 ATS away from home with only two losses by more than four points. Houston is 6-2 ATS in its past eight as a 'dog and 8-2-1 in its past 11 away. Baltimore is only 2-8-1 ATS in its past 10 home games. Trends are not everything, but the betting patterns are established with these teams -- the Texans are among the league's best road teams and the Ravens are among the league's worst home teams, especially when laying points.</p>
