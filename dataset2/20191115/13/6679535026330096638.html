      <p>NGOs working with disaster relief and long-term rehabilitation in the six districts that cyclone Gaja wrecked havoc on the night of November 15, 2018 say that efforts are slow and work is yet to be completed.</p>
      <p>Inspire, a volunteer group based in Nagapattinam, has been working to rehabilitate coconut farmers over the last year. Nearly 52 lakh coconut trees fell over in this region and it took none months to clear them out, says Revathi Radhakrishnan, its founder.</p>
      <p>“Nearly 6000 acres of coconut farms in 50 villages has been cleared. Farmers here are resilient despite knowing that they must start from square one again,” Ms. Revathi says.</p>
      <p>Inspire mobilised Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds from multinational companies and private banks in an effort to reclaim land which had turned salty. When the salt water from the sea was brought into the land by the cyclone, it mixed with the fertile soil, changing its quality, she says.</p>
      <p>Using salt-absorbing plants and seeds has been effective, says Ms. Revathi. Nearly 3000 acres of saline land has been reclaimed.</p>
      <p>The group is now focusing on construction of houses and establishing drinking water resources. “One night’s damage has cost them nearly 10 years of their lives. Some villagers are living in sheds made of torn tarpaulin sheets as they are unable to afford new ones. With the monsoon season impending, we have to work faster,” she says.</p>
      <p>Gramalaya, a Tiruchi-based NGO, has been working to rehabilitate school buildings and provide access to toilets and proper sanitation in Nagapattinam. Nearly 30 government schools now have separate wash rooms for boys and girls.</p>
      <p>“The entire project, funded by a Mumbai-based organisation, cost ₹1.3 crore,” says S. Damodaran, Director, Gramalaya.</p>
      <p>The government has worked hard to bring electricity and water to these areas. However, long-term solutions like employability and shelters are still lacking, says Ms. Revathi.</p>
