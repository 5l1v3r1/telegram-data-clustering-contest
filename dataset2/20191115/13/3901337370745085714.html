      <p>Teboho Mokoena had some inspiration from Lionel Messi before his free kick winner for South Africa’s U23s, and he’s explained the technique behind his beauty in Egypt.</p>

      <p>The 22-year-old midfielder was straight into the action at the U23 African Cup of Nations after he missed the opening 0-0 draw with Zambia, going immediately into David Notoane’s starting XI for the second match of the group stages against Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Mokoena repaid Notoane’s faith in him by stepping up late into the game to score a beautiful free kick from range that the Barcelona man himself would be pleased with, and it was enough to send them to the top of their group, meaning that a draw against Nigeria tonight will be enough to send them into the semifinals.</p>
      <p>Notoane is expected to start the SuperSport United star once again this evening as they seek to book their spot in the final four, and the South African international will be hoping to get the chance to try his luck from a set-piece once again if given the chance.</p>

      <p>Speaking to SAFA.net about his first goal at U23 AFCON 2019, Mokoena said, “Being a free kick taker is one area I have been working really hard on to improve as a player… Lionel Messi is one of the guys that I look up to. He scored a free kick a few weeks ago where instead of running towards the ball; he takes a few steps walking before pulling a strike at goal - I tried his technique and it has been working really well for me ever since.”</p>

      <p>Mokoena is known to have spent extra time at training with SuperSport putting in extra work after hours at Matsatsantsa in order to improve his free kicks, and his latest goal seems to be proof that it’s been worth the effort. </p>
