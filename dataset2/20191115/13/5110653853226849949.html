      <h1>Colin Kaepernick won't drop out of NFL's Saturday workout despite speculation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:31:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Colin Kaepernick will participate in the NFL's scheduled workout for the free agent quarterback, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/its-on-colin-kaepernick-moving-ahead-with-nfl-pro-day-on-saturday-123000777.html">according to a report</a> from Yahoo Sports.</p>
      <p>Sources told Yahoo Kaepernick "wanted to showcase his commitment to getting back into the league, even if it took place under a warped timeline from the NFL." There was some speculation during the week that Kaepernick could drop out due to the bizarre nature of how the workout came together. His representatives were also upset that the NFL reportedly backed out of its agreement to provide a list of attendees.</p>
      <p>But the league released a public statement Thursday evening listing teams that already committed while also confirming former coaches Hue Jackson and Joe Philbin would help out.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ORIGINAL STORY:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The NFL's sudden scheduled workout for Colin Kaepernick may not happen.</p>
      <p>According to various reports, the league reached out to representatives for Kaepernick on Tuesday to set up a workout for the free agent quarterback. Once agreed, the league sent a memo inviting all 32 teams an invite to attend. The whole situation caught mostinvolved off-guard.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/11/13/20962816/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-atlanta">From The Ringer</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Kaepernick’s team was contacted sometime Tuesday by NFL representatives explaining the request. Most free-agent workouts happen on Tuesday. According to the source, Kaepernick was told that the NFL needed a response “in two hours” if he was serious about the opportunity. Kaepernick and his representatives scrambled to rearrange their schedules to fit in the request, but several around Kaepernick wondered why it came in such an urgent manner. For one, a Saturday tryout conflicts with the regular NFL scouting of college football games; for another, forcing high-end NFL personnel to get on flights to and from Atlanta hours before Sunday’s kickoffs seems likely to limit the number of attendees. “It didn’t make a whole lot of sense,” the source told me.</blockquote>

        <b>STEPHEN A SMITH: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-nfl-stephen-a-smith/199top064e7yh1izmb5kamvuse">Colin Kaepernick 'needs to shut up' if he wants NFL job</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Kaepernick's team reportedlyasked the NFL to reschedule to Tuesday and were told no. They then asked if it could be moved to the following Saturday to allow teams a proper notice, and were also told no. It's not clear why the NFL madeSaturday, Nov. 16 the mandatory date.</p>
      <p>There are other critical elements involved that have given Kaepernick and his team pause, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-is-giving-colin-kaepernick-reasons-to-pull-out-of-saturdays-pro-day-024918678.html">according to Yahoo Sports</a>. A Wednesday night Yahoo report claimed the issues could rise "potentially to the point that the event could still fall apart before Saturday."</p>
      <p>Those issues include, according to Yahoo:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The NFL is refusing to provide a confirmed list of teams attending;</li>
        <li>The NFL provided no throwing script;</li>
        <li>The NFL hasn't said who Kaepernick will be throwing to.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both Yahoo and ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the same details regarding the list of teams. Thereports say Kaepernick's camp was promised a list of attendees before the event, but the NFL is denying promising that information.</p>

      <p>As a guest on"<a href="https://weei.radio.com/media/audio-channel/ghs-adam-schefter-calls-donate-fauria-s-25-25-says-he-ranks-christian-bottom">The Greg Hill Show</a>" Thursday morning, Schefterprovided his personal thoughts on the workout. The hosts made reference to the workout, joking about who the Patriots were sending and Schefter responded, "If that workout even happens."</p>
      <p>When pressed on it, Schefter was careful with his words saying, "I'm skeptical, I'll say that. We'll see." He added nothing new has happened recently to make him feel that way, saying he's been "skeptical all along."</p>
      <p>The ESPN reporter added a few more thoughts on "Get Up."</p>

      <p>"You're assuming that he has the workout Saturday," Schefter said. "No, that's not a done deal."</p>
      <p>Even though the event was scheduled on very short notice, a few teams have publicly(while others have been reported)confirmed they're sending someone to attend. Teams reportedly include the Falcons, Bengals, Cowboys, Broncos, Lions, Dolphins, Patriots, Jets, Buccaneersand Redskins. The Browns are not planning to send representation, <a href="https://twitter.com/JosinaAnderson/status/1194748171609628672">according</a> to ESPN's Josina Anderson.</p>
      <p>Yahoo's report also confirmed a team will not be attending because if they wanted to sign him, they'd hold their own private workout. Yahoo did not list which team.</p>
      <p>There's also another reason why Kaepernick may not feel like attending:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Kaepernick7/status/1194415935890894848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>At the end he mentions he "can’t wait to see the head coaches and [general managers]."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28072048/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-why-happening-now-next">ESPN's Dan Graziano</a> the people attending are "more likely to be scouts or personnel executives."Graziano adds it's "extremely unlikely that any head coach or GM whose team plays on Sunday or Monday will make the trip."</p>
      <p>Schefter's <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28074313/colin-kaepernick-know-attend-workout-ahead">report from Wednesday</a> night also pointed out, "although multiple teams have confirmed that they will attend the workout, none has identified by name who will be going." Schefter also added: "Several high-level NFL executives reached out as a courtesy to Kaepernick's representatives to say they couldn't attend and were caught off-guard and confused by the purpose of the NFL scheduling the workout."</p>
      <p>When you combine that with Kapernick's reported frustration over not receiving an attendees list, it suggests that Kaepernick doesn't want to work out for a bunch of nobodies. If no one of importance is going to attend this event, then the question can be asked as to who this event is actually for.</p>
      <p>From Schefter:</p>
      <blockquote>When Kaepernick's representatives asked whether a team or teams had asked for the workout, the NFL league office said, "We can't tell you that," the reps explained.<br/>Because of the mystery around the workout and because none of the teams had been informed before Tuesday, Kaepernick's representatives began to question the legitimacy of the workout and the process and wonder whether it was a public-relations stunt by the league, sources previously told ESPN.</blockquote>
      <p>ProFootballTalk's Mike Florio even speculated all of this could be designed by the NFL in an effort to get Kaepernick to drop out.</p>
      <p>"The league possibly now hopes that Kaepernick will become sufficiently frustrated with the process and change his mind about attending," <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/14/colin-kaepernick-still-doesnt-know-who-will-attend-saturdays-workout/">Florio writes</a>. "Then, the P.R. message will be, 'We gave him what he wanted, and he didn’t take it.'"</p>
      <p>It seems obvious, at the very least, there was a lot of frustration from Kaepernick's camp on Wednesday night. There haven't been any more significant updates on Thursday, so Kaepernick dropping out appears to still be a possibility. As of now, however, no such decision has been made.</p>
