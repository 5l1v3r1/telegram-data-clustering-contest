      <h1>Prince Andrew to give ‘no holds barred’ interview on Jeffrey Epstein friendship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:07:21+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Woods</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew is speaking out for the first time about his former <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/18/prince-andrew-appalled-by-jeffrey-epstein-sex-abuse-claims/">ties to disgraced money manager Jeffrey Epstein</a> in a “no holds barred interview” set to air this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York, 59, spoke to Emily Maitlis of the BBC’s “Newsnight” in an interview recorded Thursday at Buckingham Palace and set to air at 9 p.m. local time Saturday (4 p.m. EST) on BBC Two, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50431163">according to the network</a>.</p>
      <p>No clips of the interview have been released in advance.</p>
      <p>The interview comes in the wake of explosive claims by Epstein’s alleged teenage sex slave Virginia Giuffre that Epstein — who took his own life in his Manhattan lockup over the summer — had coerced her into having sex with Prince Andrew and other powerful men when she was underage.</p>
      <p>She claimed in court papers that she had sex with the duke when she was 17, three times — in London, at Epstein’s New York home and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/21/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-we-had-orgy-with-prince-andrew-when-i-was-18/">at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean</a>.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with “60 Minutes Australia,” Giuffre <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/virginia-roberts-giuffre-says-prince-andrew-should-go-to-jail-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">said Prince Andrew should “go to jail.”</a></p>

      <p>Back in August, the prince shot down any suggestion that he participated in his pedophile pal’s behavior.</p>
      <p>“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behavior is abhorrent,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The prince has also said he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/24/prince-andrew-regrets-friendship-with-jeffrey-epstein-after-arrest/">regrets continuing his friendship with Epstein</a> after the convicted pedophile was released from his short prison sentence in 2010.</p>
      <p>Additionally, he claimed that his scandalous 2010 trip to see Epstein at his sprawling Upper East Side mansion was actually to end his relationship with the depraved money manager.</p>
      <p>The FBI in September <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/28/fbi-expands-epstein-probe-hopes-to-snare-more-prince-andrew-accusers/">expanded its investigation</a> into Epstein in an effort to identify more victims, who may be able to provide more information about the royal’s alleged involvement.</p>
