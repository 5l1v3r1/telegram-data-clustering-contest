      <h2>The Saskatchewan Roughriders expect to face two quarterbacks — Zach Collaros and Chris Streveler — in Sunday's West final against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>The Winnipeg Blue Bombers have a two-headed monster at quarterback, but only one is classified as a “beast.”</p>
      <p>That distinction belongs to Chris Streveler, a 6-foot-2, 216-pound wrecking ball who seems to delight in running over defenders.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-wish-the-best-for-zach-collaros-except-on-sunday">Pocket passer Zach Collaros got the start in Winnipeg’s 35-14 semi-final win over the Calgary Stampeders</a>, but Streveler came off the bench on multiple occasions to provide a spark with his legs, rushing 13 times for a game-high 82 yards.</p>
      <p>Although the bruising backup didn’t throw a pass, his 24-yard major in the fourth quarter provided the knockout blow. It also served notice that — despite a lingering foot-ankle issue — he could be a handful for the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/passed-the-test-cody-fajardo-throws-during-riders-closed-practice">Saskatchewan Roughriders in Sunday’s West final at Mosaic Stadium</a>.</p>
      <p>“Streveler is a beast,” offered head coach Craig Dickenson. “He’s as big and strong as you’re going to see (at quarterback). We know they’re going to probably use both of them and probably go with the hot hand late in the second half.”</p>
      <p>Winnipeg’s original hot hand belonged to Matt Nichols, who led the club to a 7-2 record before a shoulder injury ended his season.</p>
      <p>Streveler went 3-5 as a fill-in prior to missing the last game of the regular season. He was replaced by Collaros, who had been acquired as an insurance policy at the CFL trade deadline on Oct. 9.</p>
      <p>Soon after, Winnipeg cashed it in.</p>
      <p>Collaros responded with back-to-back wins over the Stamps, completing 33 of 49 passes for 414 yards and three touchdowns, plus one interception.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Streveler started all three meetings with Saskatchewan, winning just once. He completed 67 per cent of his passes (57 of 85) for 601 yards with three TDs and four picks. He also rushed 33 times for 176 yards and three majors.</p>
      <p>“Streveler is one of the guys who’s going to run the ball a lot,” said Riders defensive back Ed Gainey. “We’re going to continue to watch film and see the tendencies of the offence. They have a good two-headed monster, or whatever you want to call it, but we’ll be prepared.”</p>
      <p>It’s not an easy task for the Riders, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/containing-quarterback-chris-streveler-is-a-key-to-the-saskatchewan-roughriders-beating-the-winnipeg-blue-bombers">who have to be ready for whatever the Bombers might throw at them — literally</a>.</p>
      <p>“Streveler is dynamic as a running quarterback but he also can keep you off balance because he has shown that he can throw the ball,” said veteran linebacker Solomon Elimimian. “For us, it’s all about being disciplined, just understanding how to play within the defence and play (sound) assignment football.</p>
      <p>“Whether it’s Collaros or Streveler, guys have to buckle down and make the plays.”</p>
      <p>Although the Bombers aren’t known for an imposing aerial attack, their league-leading ground game is formidable.</p>
      <p>Offensive co-ordinator Paul LaPolice tends to ride tailback Andrew Harris and mix in a heavy dose of Streveler, along with Nic Demski and a few others.</p>
      <p>“LaPolice is one of the better offensive co-ordinators in the CFL because he’s able to utilize guys to their skill set,” Elimimian said. “It’s not like you can key on one or two guys. He uses multiple formations to get guys an advantage.”</p>
      <p>Misdirection aside, the Bombers have shown they can win a straight-up battle in the trenches. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/calgary-stampeders/calgary-stampeders-fail-to-execute-as-winnipeg-blue-bombers-end-their-season/wcm/403e6aba-efa2-45ea-b5f0-689e1c6c5a6d">Calgary failed to stop them last weekend</a>, but the Riders vow to be prepared for a war of attrition.</p>
      <p>“You have to be ready to come out and match their physicality,” said defensive tackle Micah Johnson. “Our D-line carries pride in being the most physical group. We’re not going to get pushed around like that.”</p>
