      <h1>Mandryk: GTH and GTEC mess frighteningly similar to NDP's Spudco</h1>
      <h2>Consider the GTEC as a sad Chinese Sears outlet catalogue store a plopped into the GTH in the age of internet transactions.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:47+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/mmandryk" target="_blank">Murray Mandryk</a></address>
      <p>As the last NDP government neared the end of its second term, then economy minister Janice MacKinnon would carefully explain to reporters that the genesis of its investment in Spudco was the love teenagers have for French fries — the kind of thing that would create boundless opportunities for a diversified, agricultural-based public/private entrepreneurial partnership.</p>
      <p>Hold the fries. It didn’t quite work out.</p>
      <p>Spudco was eventually resolved in court — a $36-million-plus loss for Saskatchewan taxpayers. As it turned out, it was never the 51-49 per cent, private investor/Saskatchewan partnership the NDP administration claimed. Evidently, it was not quite as simple as government putting up initial scratch and watching the kids gobble up fries.</p>
      <p>If all this <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/taxpayers-footing-the-bill-for-buses-reveals-sask-partys-gth-problem">sounds vaguely familiar,</a> consider the present-day Saskatchewan Party government’s handling of the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/ndp-blasts-immigration-scam-at-the-gth-after-ministry-drops-mega-mall-from-program">Global Trade and Exhibition Centre (GTEC) at the Global Transportation Hub (GTH)</a>.</p>
      <p>By way of information, the GTEC is a “multi-business retail condo” concept from Brightenview Developments International (of Dundurn megamall fame) aimed at attracting foreign entrepreneurs to the GTH development, where buyers can wholesale order a variety of products from sponsored Chinese businesses. That concept is so sound that the province changed its immigration investment rules last week about the same time a CBC investigative reporter asked for a reaction to a story he was about to air on this whole sorry affair.</p>
      <p>New Democrat Opposition leader Ryan Meili said in question period Tuesday that this was as good as admitting the GTEC has been “an immigration scam at the GTH”. That seems a bit harsh, but is it?</p>
      <p>Really, is the notion of a Regina wholesale location where you can purchase Chinese-based products you could get anywhere else — consider the GTEC as a sad Chinese Sears outlet catalogue store plopped into the GTH in the age of internet transactions — any more conceptually flawed than getting into the potato business simply because kids like fries?</p>
      <p>You now get the similarities — and the problem — and what could possibly be a similarly messy legal outcome.</p>
      <p>There are now allegations swirling, according to the excellent story by the CBC’s Geoff Leo, that Brightenview misled Chinese nationals into buying spots in its megamall at the GTH as an easy, relatively hassle-free way to permanent Canadian residency. One Chinese woman, according to Leo’s story, had her application denied and cannot recover her hefty deposit on her GTEC unit.</p>
      <p>Immigration and Career Training Minister Jeremy Harrison confirmed in Tuesday’s question period the change will affect the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP) that has made it easier for some selected immigrants to gain permanent residency — a change Harrison said had to be made because the GTEC wasn’t “setting up newcomers in this business model for success in the way that we could have been in another sort of scenario.”</p>
      <p>Credit Harrison and the government for at least that much, although that more than half of the 120 units at the GTEC remain empty suggests he might have come to his blinding conclusion sooner. And given the role Harrison, his predecessor Bill Boyd et al. played, one wonders if there has been a political willfulness to promote this development as a way to obscure other messes.</p>
      <p>The Brightenview ribbon-cutting in 2017 was rolled out when the Sask. Party government and Harrison were claiming there was <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/gth-could-set-million-dollar-precedents">“no wrongdoing” in the GTH land flips </a>that saw businessmen with ties to the Sask. Party (one with close business ties to Boyd himself) make $6 million and $5 million respectively. As such, the GTEC was, as the NDP once called it, a fig leaf to cover the much bigger GTH problem.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Harrison wouldn’t talk about allegations that prospective immigrants were misled or defrauded because “there probably is going to be litigation from tenants that would be coming out of that towards companies.”</p>
      <p>Harrison should be worried about the courts, given that it’s this government that encouraged investors to sign up, and it’s this government that’s now shutting down this aspect of the SINP program.</p>
      <p>Hmmm? Settled in the courts. Sound familiar? Anyone want fries with that?</p>
