      <p>Eintracht Frankfurt will not be allowed to sell tickets to their fans for this month's Europa League match at Arsenal after losing their appeal against a UEFA sanction.</p>
      <p>European soccer's governing body charged the Bundesliga side with several offences during their Group F game against Portugal's Vitoria last month, including a late kick-off, crowd disturbances and acts of damage.</p>

      <p>Frankfurt were already under a suspended sanction and UEFA then banned them from selling tickets to away supporters for their next two European games, which the club then appealed.</p>
      <p>"Eintracht fans' two-match away ban has been upheld after UEFA's Control, Ethics and Disciplinary body rejected the Eagles' appeal on Wednesday (Nov 13) evening," Frankfurt said on their website.</p>
      <p>"Eintracht are therefore prohibited from selling tickets in any category for the UEFA Europa League group match at Arsenal on Nov 28. Eagles supporters were banned from attending the Group F match at Standard Liege earlier this month."</p>
