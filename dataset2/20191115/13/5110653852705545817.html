      <h1>Week 11 PPR Rankings: WR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:03:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>The Week 11 WR PPRrankings are an exercise in determining just how much a prototypical PPR wide receiver can move up in the rankings thanks to good matchups. From Julian Edelman to Russell Gage, basically every WR who would normally get a small boost in PPR formats also had a positive Week 11 matchup and deserved even more moving up the board than usual. The question, as it always is, is 'How much?' That's what we'll try to determine here.</p>
      <p>First, to lay out some of the good matchups I'm referring to: Edelman (@ Eagles), Jamison Crowder (@ Redskins), Mohamed Sanu (@ Eagles), Cole Beasley (@ Dolphins), Deebo Samuel (vs. Cardinals), Hunter Renfrow (vs. Bengals) and Gage (@ Panthers).</p>

      <p>For example, Crowder and Sanu leap several players compared to our standard rankings, but we didn't push the pair ahead of Marquise Brown and Terry McLaurin, players who will get decent volume and have bigger-play upside. You might have similar decisions on your roster this week, and maybe it comes down to lineup composition. Especially in good matchups, some of these PPR studs have great floors. You'd expect that against bad pass defenses, receivers who consistently rack up catches would do so at an even greater rate. So, if your lineup has question marks at running back or quarterback, maybe you take the sure thing at WR.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It's not that there'd be anything wrong with playing Calvin Ridley over Cole Beasley. It's a risk-reward proposition. There's probably a better chance of Ridley exceeding 20 fantasy points in Week 11, but in a weird reality of ceiling vs. floor, Beasley probably has a better chance of exceeding 10 fantasy points. Further down the rankings, the same contrast might be true of Renfrow and Gage versus Steelers big-play rookie Diontate Johnson.</p>

      <p>It's obviously also a matter of knowing your league's scoring. All the guys that receivea bump in these rankings did so with full-PPR in mind. It's obviously not quite as much in 0.5 PPR or whatever variation you play. Hopefully, these rankings give you a good enough idea that you can make the right calls for Week 11.</p>
