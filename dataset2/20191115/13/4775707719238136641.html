      <p>A lot of our long-time achievement hunters probably capped off their <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Grand-Theft-Auto-V/achievements">Grand Theft Auto Online achievements</a> years ago at this point, but Rockstar's maddeningly successful online multiplayer shooter is still plenty popular, and regularly updated. Its longevity is in part down to continued development of community-created content, and this latest update expands on the principle. Players will now be able to create their own custom Survival and King of the Hill games.</p>

      <p>In the Survival Creator, players will be able to place props and spawn points, tweak enemy combat prowess and choose where vehicles are going to spawn. Equally in the King of the Hill creator players will be able to control the layout of the battlefield as well as make gameplay choices, like deciding between team-based bouts or total free-for-alls. As with previous Jobs and races, all creations published via the Social Club will be available for the entire GTA community to share. To celebrate the two new Creator options, Rockstar's own King of the Hill and Survival playlists will net players Double Rewards through to November 20th.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Rockstar is offering 25% off Gunrunning supplies and a 50% boost in research speed, as well as Double Rewards on Gunrunning Sell Missions through to November 20th. Mobile Operations Missions will also be worth Double GTA $ and RP this week.</p>
      <p>Over at the Casino there's a new car in the lobby – the Bond-inspired submersible car Ocelot Stromberg. The Casino Store has been restocked with new trendy clothing ranges and well as unique artwork for your home from San Andreas' controversial art scene. There's the usual array of discounts at Warstock, and for Twitch Prime members with a linked Social Club account the Lago Zancudo Bunker and Fort Zancudo Hangar 3499 can be purchased with a complete rebate on the price, plus an extra 10% discount on various armaments and cosmetics in the game.</p>
