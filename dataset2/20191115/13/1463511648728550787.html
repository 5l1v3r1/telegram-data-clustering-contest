      <h1>Yuletide: FRSC advises motorists not to be distracted by family problems</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:05:26+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The Ogun Command of Federal Road Safety Corps ahead of yuletide, has advised motorists not to be distracted by family problems while driving to avoid accident.</p>
      <p>Clement Oladele, Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC, gave the advice during the 2019 Ember Months Campaign organised by Idiroko Command in Idiroko, Ogun on Friday.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the campaign was tagged: “Road safety is a state of mind; road crashes is an absence of mind. Stay alert, stay alive’’.</p>
      <p>Oladele noted that the advice became necessary to motorists as driving required full concentration, saying that any slight distraction would lead to mishap on the highways.</p>
      <p>The sector commander said that no fewer than 314 people had died this year across the state due to some attitude of some drivers.</p>
      <p>“Motorists need to change as their attitude may cause sorrow to somebody when an unexpected crash leading to the death of loved ones happened through them.</p>
      <p>“They can also cause sorrow to members of any family if they drive recklessly and against traffic, which sometime resulted to loss of a `bread winner’,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>The FRSC enjoined motorists to drive with caution and adhere strictly to 50km per hour speed limit where rehabilitation work is ongoing.</p>
      <p>Oladele, however, said that the Federal Government was making efforts in repairing the bad roads in order to make the nation’s highways safer for people.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Akinwunmi Olaluwoye, Idiroko Unit Commander of FRSC, said that negative attitude of some drivers had contributed to unnecessary loss of lives and property.</p>
      <p>Olaluwoye suggested a conducive environment for ease of doing business through improved road users’ behaviour so as to achieve economic growth and development.</p>
      <p>The unit commander said that some of the crashes were caused by non-compliance with traffic rules and regulations by the drivers.</p>
      <p>“It is in view of this that the FRSC usually intensifies its public enlightenment programme, especially during this period to educate motorists and road users on the importance of safety.</p>
      <p>“Also to sensitise motorists and the populace on the proper usage of the highways to guide against avoidable road traffic crashes during festivals like Christmas and New Year,’’ he said.</p>
