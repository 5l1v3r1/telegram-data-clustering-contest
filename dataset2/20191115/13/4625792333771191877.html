      <h1>North Korea says Biden is a 'rabid dog' who must be beaten to death</h1>

      <p>Joe Biden isn’t just facing criticism from President Trump but is also feeling the heat from North Korea’s dictatorial regime.</p>
      <p>Officials in the hermit nation blasted the 76-year-old former vice president as a “rabid dog” and said he must be “beaten to death with a stick.”</p>
      <p>The harsh words came from Pyongyang’s state-run Korean Central News Agency, a self-styled news organization that is really a mouthpiece of the regime. In the editorial, North Korea accused Biden of reeling “off a string of rubbish against the dignity” of leader Kim Jong Un. It said that because of his stance against the regime, Biden deserves “merciless punishment.”</p>
      <p>“Anyone who dare slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the D.P.R.K., can never spare the D.P.R.K's merciless punishment whoever and wherever,” the statement said. “Rabid dogs like [Biden] can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about.”</p>
      <p>“They must be beaten to death with a stick before it is too late,” it added.</p>
      <p>Biden spokesman Andrew Bates targeted Trump in a statement about the editorial.</p>
      <p>"It's becoming more and more obvious that repugnant dictators, as well as those who admire and 'love' them, find Joe Biden threatening," Bates said. "That's because he'd restore American leadership in the world on day one by putting our security, interests, and values at the heart of our foreign policy."</p>
      <p>Trump and Kim have been <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-has-confidence-kim-jong-un-will-denuclearize-warns-china-against-negative-pressure">trying to work out a denuclearization deal</a>. North Korea has complicated that by repeatedly test-firing rockets. In late October, it <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/north-korea-launches-more-missiles-after-saying-it-is-losing-patience-with-us">test-fired two missiles</a> in an apparent attempt to pressure the United States to return to the bargaining table and negotiate.</p>
      <p>There have been reports of a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/south-korea-kim-jong-un-will-likely-hold-summit-with-trump-in-december">possible summit in December</a>.</p>
