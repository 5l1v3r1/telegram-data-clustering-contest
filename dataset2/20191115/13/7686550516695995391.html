      <h1>All trains between Carmarthen and Milford Haven to be cancelled for five weeks up until Christmas</h1>
      <h2>The disruption is due to 'essential maintenance' that needs to be carried out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:45:22+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Harries</a></address>
      <p>Public transport in Wales could be plunged into chaos in the run up to Christmas with the cancellation of trains on a popular route.</p>
      <p>From Monday, November 18 until Sunday, December 22 no trains will run between Carmarthen and Milford Haven.</p>
      <p>This is due to maintenance work being carried out by Network Rail on the line which they insist is “essential”. There will be a replacement bus organised by Transport for Wales.</p>
      <p>It’s not just rail passengers from Carmarthen and Milford Haven that will be affected - the disruption will also hit passengers in other locations, including Whitland and the biggest town in Pembrokeshire, Haverfordwest.</p>

      <p>The work itself is being carried out between Johnston and Milford Haven, and the closed section of the line stretches between Clarbeston Road and Milford Haven.</p>
      <p>Therefore, trains will continue to stop at Carmarthen, Whitland, Clunderwen and Clarbeston Road, but anyone wishing to travel further west on that route will need to do so by bus.</p>
      <p>Transport for Wales has confirmed that on Sunday, November 24, Pembroke Dock and Fishguard services will also be affected.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to be carrying out this essential work on the Milford Haven line to improve the safety for passengers, the public and our staff,” said Bill Kelly, route director for Network Rail Wales and Borders.</p>
      <p>“We would like to thank passengers and line-side neighbours for bearing with us as we carry out this essential upgrade work.”</p>

      <p>The work will be carried out between 6am and 6pm every day between next Monday and December 22, and will involve the stripping or removal of dead, dying or diseased trees and vegetation along the route.</p>
      <p>The replacement bus running from Carmarthen to Milford Haven will operate daily and passengers are being asked to check the times of services in advance of travel.</p>
      <p>Bethan Jelfs, customer delivery director for Transport for Wales Rail Services, said: “Network Rail’s essential work in west Wales will impact on our services between Clarbeston Road and Milford Haven over the coming weeks, so customers need to be aware of how this may affect their travel.</p>
      <p>“We are working closely with Network Rail to keep disruption to a minimum and I would like to take this opportunity in advance to thank our customers for their patience and understanding whilst these essential maintenance works are being carried out.”</p>

      <p>The timing of the maintenance work is bound to prove controversial with rail commuters in the area, with the disruption coming to an end just three days before Christmas.</p>
      <p>One man who will be affected is Ron Ramage, who lives in Haverfordwest but works in London. He says he didn’t know anything of the cancelled train services until his daughter mentioned it to him.</p>
      <p>“I thought she must have got it wrong as I couldn’t see anything online so I went along to the ticket office at the station in Haverfordwest to ask,” said Mr Ramage.</p>
      <p>“They confirmed that it was happening.</p>
      <p>"I just can’t believe that there has been so little information about it. I usually get the 11.25am on Monday mornings, but have been told that the bus will go at 10.43am. I hope lots of people don’t miss the buses because they don’t know.”</p>
