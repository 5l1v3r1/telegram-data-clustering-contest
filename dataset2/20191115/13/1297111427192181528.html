      <h2>"It's all vaping's bad ... What about cigarettes? Have we forgotten what cigarettes do to us?"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:00:56+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>Saskatchewan vape shop owners are worried about the future of the industry after newly passed vaping legislation in the province left the door open to flavours being restricted — a move owners say would bankrupt an industry aimed at helping people quit smoking.</p>
      <p>Mike Smider, owner of Queen City Vapes, said he started smoking cigarettes when he was just 12 years old. He smoked on and off for the next 23 years, trying everything he could to quit along the way. What eventually helped him successfully quit was vaping.</p>
      <p>Electric Fog Vape Shop has five locations across Saskatchewan. CEO Hugh Harcus said he was a heavy smoker for years and never would have been able to quit without vaping. Caroline Staple, CEO of Vapexcape — Vape SuperStore (which owns vape shops in Regina, Yorkton and one in Manitoba), said products and staff at her stores have helped an estimated 15,000 people quit smoking.</p>
      <p>All three owners said getting adult smokers to quit smoking is why vaping exists, and that without flavours, it would not be able to serve this purpose.</p>
      <p>Staples said the staff at her stores are able to wean people off nicotine by helping them purchase products with lower and lower nicotine content over time. Without flavours, this support would disappear.</p>
      <p>“It would literally bankrupt every store,” she said.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/sask-introduces-bill-to-treat-vaping-like-smoking">On Nov. 5, provincial health minister Jim Reiter introduced a bill amending the Tobacco Control Act that would see vape products treated similarly to tobacco products. It was passed the following day, although the new rules will not come into effect until the spring. The bill does not explicitly ban flavoured vaping products, but allows the government to restrict them through regulation, which Reiter said will come after a consultation period.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“You see flavours that are just very obviously targeted to kids. When there’s flavours like cotton candy and bubble gum, that’s not targeted at a 40-year-old, that’s targeted at a kid,” he said when the bill was introduced.</p>
      <p>Jennifer May, vice president of community engagement for the Lung Association of Saskatchewan, said she is advocating for all flavours except tobacco to be banned.</p>
      <p>“Flavours mask the addictive component, if you will, so if there was no flavour to it, I don’t think 13, 14, 15-year-old kids would be taking it up like they have,” she said. “It’s about protecting kids at the end of the day.”</p>

      <p>But Smider disagrees that these flavours specifically target youth. Between 75 and 80 per cent of his sales are fruit, candy and dessert flavours. Smider pointed to these high numbers as well as to nicotine replacement therapies found in drug stores — and even alcohol products — with similar flavours as proof that these are appealing to adults.</p>
      <p>“If I hadn’t given this product a chance, I would have been a lifelong smoker,” he said, adding that if vape flavours were banned, he would end up going back to smoking.</p>
      <p>“It’s all vaping’s bad … What about cigarettes? Have we forgotten what cigarettes do to us?”</p>
      <p>Harcus said he does not want to see youth vaping, and wants to see vape products completely removed from any space where youth are allowed, like convenience stores.</p>
      <p>“We’re in the business of helping people get off cigarettes … We’re not in the business of starting fresh people into vaping,” he said.</p>
      <p>As for its use as a way to quit smoking, May noted vape products have not been approved by Health Canada as a smoking cessation aid. While she is not opposed to adult smokers vaping as a way to transition away from cigarettes, she said a lack of flavours would not keep adults from doing this.</p>
      <p>“Your tobacco isn’t flavoured and you still use it,” she said.</p>
      <p>To show the stories of ex-smokers who have switched to vaping, Smider said he started a postcard campaign, asking people who quit smoking because of vaping to write their stories and send it to him.</p>
