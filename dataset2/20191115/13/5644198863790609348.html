      <p>JAKARTA: Indonesia swung to a trade surplus in October due to a slower-than-expected drop in exports, despite weak global trade amid the US-China trade war, data from the statistics bureau showed on Friday (Nov 15).</p>
      <p>Southeast Asia's largest economy recorded a trade surplus of US$161.3 million in October, the data showed, compared with the median forecast in a Reuters poll for a deficit of US$280 million.</p>

      <p>In recent months, Indonesia had been swinging back and forth from posting small deficits to small surpluses. In September, it had a deficit of US$164 million while in August a surplus of US$112 million.</p>
      <p>Satria Sambijantoro, economist at Bahana Sekuritas in Jakarta, said the October data looked "impressive" amid sluggish global trade and the protracted US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>"Falling exports must be seen in context. Exports had beat consensus forecast for two months in a row, driven by manufacturing exports," he said.</p>
      <p>Indonesia's exports in October amounted to US$14.93 billion, down 6.13 per cent on-year. The poll had expected an 8.38 per cent drop in the overall exports.</p>
      <p>On a monthly basis, exports rose 6 per cent, driven by a 5 per cent increase in shipments of manufactured goods such as cars and sport shoes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, October imports dropped 16.39 per cent annually, the sharpest in five months, to US$14.77 billion. The drop was roughly in line with the poll's prediction of a 16 per cent fall.</p>
      <p>Authorities in Indonesia have made improving the trade performance a top priority, seeking for ways to boost exports and find import substitutions following last year's record high deficit of US$8.7 billion.</p>
      <p>Andry Asmoro, Bank Mandiri's chief economist, said the smaller-than-expected export contraction was more to do with last year's high base figure, rather than any significant impact from the government efforts.</p>
      <p>Asmoro said the surprising surplus could mean this year's current account deficit would be smaller than his current forecast of 2.8 per cent of GDP. Last year's deficit was 3 per cent of GDP.</p>
      <p>Asmoro said Bank Indonesia (BI), which tracks trade and current account deficits when deciding monetary policy, is unlikely to make a fifth rate cut in next week's policy meeting in response to the trade data.</p>
      <p>BI has already brought down its key rate by 100 basis points in four successive cuts since July to try to lift economic growth amid a global slowdown.</p>
      <p>BI targets current account deficit at a range of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP in 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>Indonesia had a US$1.79 billion trade deficit in January-October, significantly smaller than the US$5.57 billion gap in the corresponding period last year. </p>
