      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> plans to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) leaders meeting in the United Kingdom early next month, the White House said Friday.</p>
      <p>“President Trump looks forward to meeting with the other NATO Heads of State and government to review the Alliance’s unprecedented progress on burden-sharing, including adding more than $100 billion in new defense spending since 2016,” White House press secretary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/stephanie-grisham">Stephanie Grisham</a> said in a statement Friday.</p>
      <p>“The President will also emphasize the need for the NATO Alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow, including those emanating from cyberspace, those affecting our critical infrastructure and telecommunications networks, and those posed by terrorism,” Grisham said.</p>
      <p>Trump and first lady <a href="https://thehill.com/people/melania-trump">Melania Trump</a> will travel to the U.K. to attend the meeting between Dec. 2 and 4. They will also attend a reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes one day after Trump met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House.</p>
      <p>Trump has long pushed NATO member countries to contribute more to the alliance. </p>
