        <b>The minister who heckled Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Glasgow has been suspended while an investigation into controversial tweets is carried out.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rev Richard Cameron <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50397033">shouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a community centre</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It later emerged that he had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on social media.</p>
      <p>The Church of Scotland has confirmed he will not be allowed to work as a minister while inquiries continue.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the church said: "In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended.</p>
      <p>"This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use."</p>
      <p>In one tweet Rev Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as "unnatural".</p>

      <p>"Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos," he added.</p>
      <p>In September, he tweeted: "Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion."</p>
      <p>He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as "a problem Islam needs to deal with", a full face veil as "oppressive and unBritish" and the Prophet Muhammad as "a violent man".</p>

      <p>In another post, he said: "The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ".</p>
      <p>When initially alerted to the tweets, the church said it "deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic".</p>
      <p>Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old heckled Mr Corbyn during a two-day trip to Scotland, branding him a "terrorist sympathiser".</p>

      <p>As Mr Corbyn was telling reporters about a scarf given to him by the Who Cares? Scotland charity, Rev Cameron shouted that he thought the Labour leader would be wearing an "Islamic jihad scarf".</p>
      <p>"Do you think the man that's going to be prime minister of this country should be a terrorist sympathiser, Mr Corbyn?" he added.</p>
      <p>"Who's going to be the first terrorist invited to the House of Commons when you're prime minister?"</p>
      <p>The Labour leader did not react and he was ushered into the community centre by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.</p>
