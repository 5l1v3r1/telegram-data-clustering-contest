      <h1>Saracens pick just four of their Champions Cup final XV for opener in Paris</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:18:30+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Heagney</a></address>
      <p>Crisis club <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> will open their Champions Cup title defence in Paris on Sunday with an XV containing just four of the players that started last May’s cup final win over Leinster.</p>
      <p>Dealing with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/those-answers-dont-just-come-in-24-hours-mark-mccall-urges-patience-around-saracens-salary-cap-drama">ramifications of being found guilty of salary cap breaches</a> by Premiership Rugby, a £5.3million fine and a 35-point deduction if their appeal is unsuccessful, the Londoners suggested they might not go full tilt in trying to successfully defend their European crown.</p>
      <p>Another factor impinging on selection for Racing is the need to rest a contingent of players who were away at a World Cup where <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> reached the final.</p>
      <p>It has all added up to leave director of rugby Mark McCall picking just four players who started at St James’ Park six months ago.</p>
      <p>The backline features midfielder <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/alex-lozowski/">Alex Lozowski</a> and scrum-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/ben-spencer/">Ben Spencer</a>, who fleetingly featured in the World Cup final off the bench after being called up following a semi-final injury to Willi Heinz.</p>

      <p>Upfront, American prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/titi-lamositele/">Titi Lamositele</a> and Australian <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/will-skelton/">Will Skelton</a> are the only repeat picks in a pack that at least includes <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester/players/jack-singleton/">Jack Singleton</a>, the newly-signed hooker whose World Cup with England amounted to a short run off the bench in a pool game versus the USA.</p>
      <p>Fly-half <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/manu-vunipola/">Manu Vunipola</a> is set for his first strides in Europe with the Londoners, as is winger Rotimi Segun. <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/callum-hunter-hill/">Callum Hunter-Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/matt-gallagher/">Matt Gallagher</a> are also in from the outset.</p>
