      <p><b>iKON</b>'s former leader <b>B.I </b>did his first action on social media after a long time and fans became crazy.</p>
      <p>His last update was a letter, which is about his apology and leavingiKON five months ago on <b>Instagram</b>. However, after a while, it was revealed that<a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/06/sbs-reporter-revealed-that-yg-forced-bi-to-leave-ikon-stoplyingyge-is-trending-worldwide"> YG forced him to leave his group</a> by a reliable SBS reporter on a radio program and no objection was made by YGE after this report.</p>
      <p>B.I <b>deleted</b> his last apology post with 142 posts included his own photos<b> except for </b>only iKON photos with 7 members and birthday greetings for the members on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shxxbi131/?hl=tr">his IG </a>account. One of these iKON posts has this caption; <i>"There wasn't a single day that wasn't precious" </i>from the previous anniversary celebration.</p>

      <p>Fans also realized that he updated his <b>SoundCloud </b>account that he only put his unreleased songs as a demo. He deleted his all demos except one demo which is the most emotional and meaningful one. Its name is "<b>잘있어 (Take Care)"</b>.  Some fans worry about that especially because of its lyrics.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Take care. Don’t be sick. Make sure to eat well.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Take care. Erase all your memories with me.I’ll go now. </i>
      </p>
      <p><i>It’ll be hard because the memories are too heavy. Take care."</i><br/>However, most fans think and hope that it would be a fresh start for him from now on.</p>
