      <h1>‘Groundbreaking’: Qantas London-Sydney flight lands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:21:54+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>‘Groundbreaking’. With just 40 passengers and crew on board, an ultra-long Qantas flight from London to Sydney has just touched down successfully in Sydney after a slight delay.</p>
      <p>As part of a trial for a potential commercial route, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner took off on Thursday morning London time and landed in Sydney 45 minutes behind schedule at 12:30pm on Friday (AEDT).</p>
      <p>The test flight, as part of Project Sunrise, carried a total of 40 people (<a href="https://twitter.com/Qantas/status/1194844966205480960">Qantas had originally said 62 passengers and crew</a>) to the other side of the world in 19-and-a-half hours. It comes as the Australian airline celebrates 100 years of service.</p>
      <p>Commanded by Captain Helen Trenerry, Qantas set up a live-stream from the cockpit to follow the 17,750 journey across the globe.</p>
      <p>Carrying 100,000kg of fuel (tanks not quite full) with a takeoff weight of 231,920 kg, the flight plan flight plan had a massive 49 waypoints between London and Sydney.</p>

      <p>A Dreamliner can usually carry up to 300 people, but it is currently impossible to fly a plane at full capacity of both passengers and cargo from London to Sydney without refuelling.</p>
      <p>Those on board were mostly Qantas employees fitted with monitors to track sleep patterns, food and drink intake, lighting and physical movement.</p>
      <p>It was the second aircraft to fly the route non-stop, with the first touching down in August 1989. The Boeing 747-400 which undertook the journey carried no passengers, only crew, and is now at an Australian museum.</p>
      <p>Qantas flew a Dreamliner non-stop from New York to Sydney last month, although the route is around 1600km shorter.</p>
      <p>Aviation blog FlightMode said the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner described the flight as “groundbreaking”.</p>

      <p>In announcing he was a passenger before the flight left the UK, aviation blogger Sam Chui said he was “overcoming the final frontier of aviation”.</p>
      <p>“Today I’m flying @Qantas flight 7879 nonstop from London to Sydney. Flight time is projected around 19 hours and forecast to see double sunrise en-route!,” he wrote on social media.</p>
      <p>At one point over the snow-capped mountains of Russia, FlightRadar24 said they were “tracking ahead of the flight plan”.</p>
      <p>“Many well wishes from ATC and other aircraft. Lots of snow in Russia.</p>
      <p>“Supper meal service now complete and the cabin is now in darkness for sleeping. Breakfast in 8 hours.”</p>
      <p>Just before 11am on Friday, “Longreach” was tracking over its namesake in outback Queensland.</p>

      <p>It comes as the Australian national carrier celebrates 100 years of service.</p>
      <p>Among those at Sydney Airport to greet QF7879 were Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, as well as Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce and chairman Richard Goyder.</p>
