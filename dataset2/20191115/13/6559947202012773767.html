      <p> <b>$399.00</b></p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <p>Rock-bottom price. Fair 1080p instead of 1,366-by-768-pixel screen.</p>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <p>Skimpy 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. No HDMI port. Poor webcam placement. Weak speakers.</p>
      <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>Walmart's onn. house brand debuts a 14-inch laptop priced at $399. The I3 inevitably makes compromises—no HDMI port, only half the ideal memory and storage—but its 1080p screen and Core i3 CPU are perfectly respectable.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Motile. iView. Ematic. Direkt-Tek. EVOO. (No, not extra virgin olive oil.) Walmart shoppers have always had access to lesser-known laptop brands beyond retail standbys such as Acer and HP. Now they have another—a house label called onn. (Officially spelled like that—in lowercase, with a period—a terror to sentence structure in a review like this.) The onn. offerings range from a $79 Android tablet to a $448 65-inch HDTV to a $419 13.3-inch convertible. The onn. I3 ($399) is a 14-inch clamshell <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/laptops/158/the-best-laptops">laptop</a> with a humble Intel Core i3 CPU and an even humbler 4GB of memory and 128GB solid-state drive. It won't knock your socks off, but it's a capable choice for basic web surfing and productivity.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>A Screen Advantage</h3>
      <p>Like some of its bargain-priced competitors, the onn. I3 comes with Windows 10 Home in S mode, meaning you must log in with a Microsoft account and are limited to software within the walled garden of the Windows Store. An option in the Settings/System menu lets you visit the Store to perform an irreversible switch to regular Windows 10 Home. (I did that changeover in order to run our performance benchmarks.)</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Unlike many of its competitors, the onn. I3's screen offers a full HD (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) native resolution, which put the kibosh on my instinct to immediately recommend something like the Dell Inspiron 14 3000 ($450 with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB hard drive) or HP 14z ($460 with an AMD A9, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD) instead. Their displays have the measly 1,366-by-768-pixel resolution we now consider passable only on 11-inch Chromebooks.</p>
      <p>In addition to its 4GB of memory and 128GB solid-state drive, the laptop features a dual-core, four-thread Core i3-8145U processor running at 2.1GHz (3.9GHz in turbo mode). Visuals are handled by the chip's built-in Intel UHD 620 Graphics silicon.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673128-the-core-components.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Ports are limited to a USB 3.1 Type-C port on the left (along with the connector for the AC adapter) and a USB 3.1 Type-A port, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot on the right. There is no HDMI or other output for an external monitor, though 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are standard.</p>

      <p>Design-wise, the onn. I3 is a generic, silver-gray wedge measuring 0.7 by 12.7 by 8.6 inches and weighing about 3.2 pounds. Fairly thin black top and side bezels flank the glossy non-touch display. The system feels more solid than I expected, with little flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. Don't look for a fingerprint reader or face recognition webcam; the only use of Windows Hello is a PIN at system sign-in.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Try Another Angle</h3>
      <p>Speaking of the webcam, it's mounted below instead of above the screen, which is always a mistake, giving a looming view of your shoulders and up your nose. The 720p camera captures reasonably well-lit and sharp images with good color, but you'll nevertheless want to replace it with a USB webcam if you anticipate a lot of video calling.</p>
      <p>The keyboard is not backlit and suffers from one of my pet peeves—cursor arrows in an HP-style row instead of an inverted T, with half-height up and down arrows sandwiched between full-height left and right. The arrow keys also double with the Fn key for Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down. The typing feel is shallow and stiff, requiring a firm rap to register a keystroke, but it's possible to maintain a brisk pace with practice. The buttonless touchpad taps and glides smoothly.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>As economy screens go, the onn. I3's 1080p panel is not too bad. Brightness is barely adequate, with white backgrounds coming across as a little dingy, but details are reasonably sharp—you won't see fuzzy screen elements or edges of text unless you're specifically looking for them. The display provides decent contrast and colors, though its wide viewing angles are spoiled by its high reflectivity.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673122-a-reflective-angle.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The audio isn't very loud, even with volume cranked up to 100 percent, and it sounds flat and tinny—I had to cry uncle and quit after listening to half a dozen MP3s. There's no bass to speak of, and it's difficult to distinguish overlapping tracks. A Realtek Audio Console utility offers an equalizer and a hollow-sounding wraparound effect; otherwise, the onn. I3 is commendably free of bloatware, except for Windows' own add-ons such as Candy Crush Friends Saga.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The Speed Wrapup: About What You'd Expect</h3>
      <p>With only 4GB of RAM, the onn. I3 wouldn't complete our usual Adobe Photoshop image-editing benchmark test, but it was game for our other performance trials. I compared it to four other affordable laptops of varying screen sizes...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673136-onn-i3-config-chart.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The most expensive, <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/hp-pavilion-x360-14/121769/hp-pavilion-x360-14">HP's Pavilion x360 14</a> and <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/acer-aspire-5-a515-54-51dj/121679/acer-aspire-5-a515-54-51dj">Acer's Aspire 5</a>, feature Core i5 processors. The least, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/dell-inspiron-11-3000-2-in-1-2019/122687/dell-inspiron-11-3000-2-in-1-2019">Dell Inspiron 11 3000 2-in-1</a>, combines an AMD A9 chip with eMMC flash storage that's quicker than the Acer Spin 3's hard drive but slower than the true SSDs of the other contenders. You can see the quintet's basic specs in the table below.</p>
      <p>Since it's a Core i3 laptop with 4GB of memory, I didn't think the onn. I3 would be a barn-burner, but it proved suitable for the casual surfing and home productivity for which it's intended. It's an absolute nonstarter as a potential gaming rig, but that's true of almost any low-end notebook with integrated graphics.</p>
      <h4>Productivity, Storage &amp; Media Tests</h4>
      <p>PCMark 10 and 8 are holistic performance suites developed by the PC benchmark specialists at UL (formerly Futuremark). The PCMark 10 test we run simulates different real-world productivity and content-creation workflows. We use it to assess overall system performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing, spreadsheet work, web browsing, and videoconferencing. The test generates a proprietary numeric score; higher numbers are better.</p>
      <p>PCMark 8, meanwhile, has a Storage subtest that we use to assess the speed of the boot drive. The result is also a proprietary numeric score; again, higher numbers are better.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673138-onn-i3-pcmark.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Only the Core i5 notebooks came close to the 4,000 points that we consider an excellent PCMark 10 score, but the onn. I3 managed a solid midfield finish. It won't make you wait for everyday Word, PowerPoint, or Google Docs jobs. The three systems with solid-state drives performed capably in PCMark 8's storage exercise.</p>
      <p>Next is Maxon's CPU-crunching Cinebench R15 test, which is fully threaded to make use of all available processor cores and threads. Cinebench stresses the CPU rather than the GPU to render a complex image. The result is a proprietary score indicating a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673135-onn-i3-cinebench.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The onn. entry fought the other Core i3 laptop, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/acer-spin-3-sp314-51-38xk/95169/review/acer-spin-3-sp314-51-38xk">Acer Spin 3</a>, for third place in this contest but narrowly lost. It'll handle most Excel spreadsheets, but it is far from ready for tasks like video editing or 3D rendering.</p>
      <p>Cinebench is often a good predictor of our Handbrake video-editing trial, another tough, threaded workout that's highly CPU-dependent and scales well with cores and threads. In it, we put a stopwatch on test systems as they transcode a standard 12-minute clip of 4K video (the open-source Blender demo movie <a href="https://mango.blender.org/"><i>Tears of Steel</i></a>) to a 1080p MP4 file. It's a timed test, and lower results are better.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673137-onn-i3-handbrake.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The little Inspiron convertible and its AMD A9 chip took forever to finish this job. The onn. I3 needed only one-fifth the time, but the Core i5 laptops were twice as fast.</p>
      <h4>Graphics Tests</h4>
      <p>3DMark measures relative graphics muscle by rendering sequences of highly detailed, gaming-style 3D graphics that emphasize particles and lighting. We run two different 3DMark subtests, Sky Diver and Fire Strike, which are suited to different types of systems. Both are DirectX 11 benchmarks, but Sky Diver is more suited to laptops and midrange PCs, while Fire Strike is more demanding and made for high-end PCs to strut their stuff. The results are proprietary scores.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673133-onn-i3-3dmark.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Even the leading Aspire 5's score was far, far below those of gaming laptops with discrete graphics. These systems are strictly for casual or browser-based games, not the latest AAA titles.</p>
      <p>Next up is another synthetic graphics test, this time from Unigine Corp. Like 3DMark, the Superposition test renders and pans through a detailed 3D scene and measures how the system copes. In this case, it's rendered in the company's eponymous Unigine engine, offering a different 3D workload scenario than 3DMark, for a second opinion on the machine's graphical prowess.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673139-onn-i3-superposition.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Most slideshows proceed faster than these systems at full HD resolution. Again, don't even think about playing demanding, full-retail games on the onn. I3 or any of these machines.</p>
      <h4>Battery Rundown Test</h4>
      <p>After fully recharging the laptop, we set up the machine in power-save mode (as opposed to balanced or high-performance mode) where available and make a few other battery-conserving tweaks in preparation for our unplugged video rundown test. (We also turn Wi-Fi off, putting the laptop into airplane mode.) In this test, we loop a video—a locally stored 720p file of the same <i>Tears of Steel</i> movie we use in our Handbrake trial—with screen brightness set at 50 percent and volume at 100 percent until the system conks out.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/673134-onn-i3-battery-rundown.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Since the onn. I3 is aimed at consumers instead of office workers, it's not quite right to say its battery will get you through a workday, and indeed eight and a half hours isn't a particularly impressive runtime for a lightweight laptop nowadays. But it's not bad, and it will certainly suffice for an evening of Netflix on the couch and then some.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Playing Lowball</h3>
      <p>Make no mistake, $399 is a good price for a 14-inch laptop with an Intel Core (as opposed to Celeron or Pentium) CPU, an SSD instead of a hard drive, and a 1080p display. The onn. I3's memory and storage may be cramped for Windows 10, but it's a worthy alternative to a Chromebook, and its build quality is a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't be surprised if Walmart sells a good many.</p>
