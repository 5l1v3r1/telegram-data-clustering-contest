      <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Excited for the holiday season but nervous about holiday spending? Seasonal jobs can help add some cash to the gift-giving stash!<br/><br/>According to experts, almost a million new jobs are available this season, facing the tightest labor market in decades. At 3.6%, unemployment is at a 50-year low, so employers are reaching into new populations to staff up.<br/><br/>The bulk of these jobs are related to e-commerce shopping.<br/><br/>UPS alone said it will <a href="https://abc7news.com/business/ups-to-hire-100k-workers-this-holiday-season/5525729/">account for 100,000 of these jobs</a> to deal with the crush of packages, and at Amazon, seasonal workers can earn $15 an hour and up.<br/><br/>For seasonal job seekers, the two most in-demand skills are communication and customer service, said Ian Siegel, CEO of online job board ZipRecruiter.<br/><br/>"Just about everybody with a positive attitude is qualified to go get one of these jobs," he told Good Morning America.<br/><br/>Retailers are expected to hire more than 500,000 temporary workers nationwide, according to the National Retail Federation.<br/><br/>Macy's, for example, <a href="https://abc7.com/shopping/macys-hiring-80000-employees-for-holiday-season-/5594866/">is hiring 80,000 workers this season</a>, filling several positions in Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores.
