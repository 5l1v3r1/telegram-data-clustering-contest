      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/inkas/">Inkas Sentry </a>is a Ford F-550-based SUV for people who need serious protection. For 2020, the company introduces the Sentry Civilian as the first version of the machine available to the wider public.</p>
      <p>Power comes from a 6.7-liter turbodiesel V8 with 330 horsepower (246 kilowatts) and runs through a 10-speed automatic with four-wheel drive. While the bones from a F-550, Inkas upgrades it with a more capable suspension, heavy-duty breaks, and reinforced mechanical components.</p>

      <p>The Sentry Civilian has BR6-level armor. This means that it can take firepower up to 7.62X51 mm lead round from an assault rifle. In addition, the SUV can protect occupants from a blast the equivalent of two German DM51 hand grenades. There's also an air purifier system to give occupants even more security.</p>
      <p>The exterior of the Sentry Civilian looks like something that would be rolling through a warzone. It has a boxy overall aesthetic, and chiseled angles put an edge on anywhere the body could have a curve. Powered doors making opening the heavy, armored panels an easier job.</p>
      <p>Inkas pitches the Sentry Civilian at wealthy people who are afraid of attacks. Because of this, the interior is quite luxurious, and there's room for six people – two in front and four in the rear section. Customers can select whether there's an <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/google/">Google</a> voice assistant. Each occupant gets a captain's chair with heating, cooling, and massage function. A partition between the front seats and passenger area doubles as a huge entertainment screen. Buyers can also load the vehicle with options like night vision systems, chemical protection, and 360-degree surveillance cameras.</p>
