      <p>Following 12 years of silence, Microsoft Studios confirmed at Gamescom 2017 that Age of Empires 4 is in development for PC. The hugely popular series began way back in 1997, and despite the fact that there hasn’t been a new game in the franchise for quite some time, it’s still held in high regard by the gaming community.</p>
      <p>So, what should you expect from Age of Empire 4? Here, we discuss a possible release date, along with platform availability and what to expect from gameplay.</p>
      <h3>When will Age of Empires 4 be released?</h3>
      <p>Of course, the biggest question of all is ‘When is the Age of Empires 4 release date?’ and sadly, Microsoft hasn't revealed a release date – or even a release window.</p>
      <p>Looking back at previous Age of Empires releases, there’s no real release date pattern; the first in the series launched way back in 1997, followed by Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings in 1999, and Age of Empires 3 in 2005. There was only a gap of two years between the first two games, while the gap between the second and third tripled to six years.</p>
      <p>If we follow the pattern of tripling the gap between games, Age of Empires 4 won’t be out until 2023 – but of course, it won’t be that far off!</p>
      <h3>Which platforms will Age of Empires 4 be available on?</h3>
      <p>As announced by publisher Microsoft Studios, Age of Empires 4 is headed to Windows 10 PCs. There’s no word yet on whether it’ll make its way to the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games-consoles/xbox-one-x-preview-3660153/">Xbox One</a> as part of Microsoft’s Play Anywhere functionality, or whether it’ll be available for other consoles like the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games-consoles/ps4-pro-review-playstation-4-pro-review-3649359/">PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/games-consoles/nintendo-switch-review-3652907/">Nintendo Switch</a> - though we doubt it on that front.</p>
      <h3>Watch the trailer</h3>
      <p>In addition to the concept trailer at the top of the page from the game's announcement, Microsoft released a first gameplay trailer for Age of Empires 4 at X019:</p>

      <h3>What should I expect from Age of Empires 4 gameplay?</h3>
      <p>Age of Empires 4 is the latest in the real-time strategy franchise since the release of Age of Empires 3 in 2005. The first three games in the series were developed by Ensemble Studios, a company that is no longer in business.</p>
      <p>Relic Entertainment has taken up the mantle, confirmed by Microsoft in an Xbox Wire announcement. For those unaware, the Canada-based development company is highly regarded in the real-time strategy world. The company has produced hugely popular titles including Company of Heroes, Homeworld and, of course, <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/pc-games-software/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-3-review-3658204/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 3</a>.</p>
      <p>Talking about the decision to develop the game with Relic, Microsoft Studios creative director Adam Isgreen <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3663398-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgame%2Fage-of-empires-4-3663398%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.xbox.com%2F2017%2F08%2F21%2Fgamescom-2017-age-of-empires-stream-recap%2F">explained that</a> “Relic Entertainment has a wealth of experience in creating high-quality RTS games, making them the ideal partner to develop Age of Empires 4.”</p>
      <p>This was backed up by a similar blog post on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3663398-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fgame%2Fage-of-empires-4-3663398%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.relic.com%2F%23news%2F8349">Relic’s own website</a>: “We can’t wait to tap into our strengths as a studio to fuse historical context with deep strategic gameplay, and to bring this franchise back to the forefront of gaming and into the hands of its beloved community,”.</p>
      <p>But in terms of actual gameplay, there’s not much to go on. The first gameplay trailer above looks like fairly standard AoE fare, albeit with a massive upgrade in terms of both graphics and the sheer level of detail on show.</p>
      <p>There are two playable races shown in the trailer - the Mongols and the English - but we don't know how many others will feature in the final game.</p>
