      <p>FLORENCE, Wis. - A county in rural northeastern Wisconsin has declared itself a Second Amendment sanctuary, a move commissioners say is designed to send a "keep your hands off our guns" message to politicians.</p>
      <p>The nonbinding measure gives the sheriff the ability to "exercise sound discretion to not enforce against any citizen an unconstitutional firearms law," the Journal Sentinel reported. </p>
      <p>Florence County Supervisor Edwin Kelley said a recent call by Gov. Tony Evers for gun control action has made his constituents nervous.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Dan Miller says people who live "up north" tend to be more conservative and like their guns. He says the ordinance "sends a message that all of Wisconsin is not exactly the same."</p>
      <p>The ordinance doesn't mean firearms will not be taken away from convicted felons or in criminal cases, including domestic violence or drugs.</p>
