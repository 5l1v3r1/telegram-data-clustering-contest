      <p>Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has quietly rolled out a new social network that is intended to get right what Facebook and Twitter have so far been getting wrong. <br/><br/>The new social network, WT:Social, which Wales <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/1192160194693718017">announced had 25,000 members on November 6</a>, now has about 78,000 members who are at least intrigued by the idea of a social network that combats fake news. <br/><br/>The site goes against the ad-funded models normalized by Google, Facebook, and Twitter, instead asking users to pay a subscription fee to access information and communicate on the site. <br/><br/>It costs $12.99 a month or $100 a year in the US, or €12 a month or €90 a year in Europe. It's £10 and £80 in the UK. In other words, about the same as a Netflix or Spotify subscription. However, questions remain over what content WT:Social can provide that users would be willing to part with money for. <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/topic/digital-transformation-a-cxos-guide/"><b>Digital transformation: A CXO's guide</b></a><b> (ZDNet special report) | </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/digital-transformation-a-cxo-s-guide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Download the report as a PDF</b></a><b> (TechRepublic)</b></p>
      <p>The social network is a reboot of WikiTribune, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiTribune">launched in 2017 as a news-sharing service but didn't gain traction</a> and ended up with Wales laying off several journalists it had hired. WikiTribune was launched off the back of a crowdfunding campaign.   <br/><br/>Wales <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9956ff9c-0622-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd">spoke with the Financial Times</a> about the new project and the site's jarring proposition for consumers, or rather users, who expect social networks to be free. LinkedIn could be an exception here. </p>
      <p>"The business model of social-media companies, of pure advertising, is problematic," Wales told the publication.<br/><br/>"It turns out the huge winner is low-quality content," he added.  <br/><br/>Wales hopes WT:Social can attract 50 million or even half a billion users and points to the success of Netflix and Spotify in attracting people who are willing to pay for "meaningful" content. <br/><br/>Signing up is free, but WT:Social has established a wait-list that paying donors can bypass. So far, just 200 people have paid to skip the waiting list. <br/><br/>He doesn't expect the social network to be profitable but reckons it can be sustainable with its current barebones staff. <br/><br/>Wales didn't go down the crowdfunding route this time and says he wants to "keep a tight rein on the costs". <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/most-americans-cant-recognize-2fa-https-or-private-browsing/"><b>Most Americans can't recognize 2FA, HTTPS, or private browsing</b></a><br/><br/>Instead of the global news focus of WikiTribune, WT:Social aims to build smaller self-sustaining communities built around niche subjects.<br/><br/>And rather than hire moderators to monitor fake news as Facebook has, Wales' social network would rely on a community of users to enforce standards. Since all content on the platform can be edited or deleted by other users, he believes there's a good incentive for good behavior by users.</p>
