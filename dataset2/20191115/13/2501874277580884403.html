      <p>Does anyone have more information on a violent assault and possible hate crime that took place in Isla Vista this week?</p>
      <p>I received a notice from the University stated they received a report of a hate crime and are in connection with the victims. People who apparently witnessed it said last week a white male wearing a UCSB Gaucho shirt beat up a guy, called him the F-word, then assaulted a few girls. This was outside Rockfire Grill on Pardall.  </p>
      <p>Outside of the notice from UCSB and people talking, I haven't seen any information or followup in local news. What's up?</p>
