      <h2>Equality and the environment are the top priorities for two Green Party candidates up for election in the Black Country.</h2>

      <p>Kathryn Gilbert, 68, is standing in Wolverhampton South East having lived and worked in the city for over 40 years.</p>
      <p>She said: “Our lives are interconnected. Our connections with family, community, country and planet make us strong. The climate crisis is calling an end to the politics of division.</p>
      <p>“I believe that the Green Party is the only party with the fresh thinking we desperately need to confront the massive challenges facing us.”</p>

      <p>Andrea Cantrill, 43, a veteran of the past two general elections, will contest Wolverhampton North East.</p>
      <p>She said: “I believe people in front line services need to be supported effectively. Nurses know how to nurse and teachers know how to teach, so invest in schools and the NHS so teachers and nurses can do their jobs.</p>
      <p>“Most of all we know that without protecting this planet we are nothing. I will continue to stand up for change because it just makes sense.”</p>
      <p>The Green Party will not be running a candidate in Wolverhampton South West at this election.</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton Green Party Coordinator, Clive Wood, said: "In this election we’ve decided to focus on standing general election candidates in the east of the city while continuing to campaign hard for next year’s local elections across the city.</p>
      <p>"The party will not be entering into any kind of deal, pact or alliance with any other party, and does not endorse any other party."</p>
      <p>The People's Vote campaign has urged Remainers to back Labour in Wolverhampton South West, although the Lib Dems have put forward a candidate for the seat.</p>
