      <h1>UFC Fight Night viewers guide: With Jon Jones in sight, it's win or bust for Blachowicz, Jacare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T13:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brett Okamoto and Jeff Wagenheim</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2506250/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2431314/jacare-souza">Ronaldo "Jacare" Souza</a> both know what it feels like to be one win away from a UFC title shot only to come up short in a crucial moment. And both are hoping to avoid another career-altering disappointment when they meet in the main event of <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player?id=03a2cedc-a358-4fbf-bc43-081feeb0c57b">UFC Fight Night on Saturday in Sao Paulo, Brazil</a>.</p>
      <p>Blachowicz (24-8) was on a four-fight win streak in February when he suffered a TKO loss to <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3045798/thiago-santos">Thiago Santos</a>. Santos went on to <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/mma/story/_/id/27170072/thiago-santos-fighting-jon-jones-torn-ligaments-never-stop">fight for the light heavyweight championship</a> in his next bout.</p>
      <p>Souza (26-7) has experienced similar heartbreak as a middleweight -- twice. <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3009717/robert-whittaker">Robert Whittaker</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3026011/kelvin-gastelum">Kelvin Gastelum</a> both went on to fight for the title after defeating "Jacare." The Brazilian, at age 39, is now seeking a fresh start in the 205-pound division.</p>
      <p>The winner of Saturday's main event, which takes place at Ginasio Do Ibirapuera and <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player?id=03a2cedc-a358-4fbf-bc43-081feeb0c57b">airs on ESPN+</a> (8 p.m. ET main card, 5 p.m. ET prelims), will not be guaranteed a title shot, but he will at least place himself in the conversation. The loser will be searching for answers on where to go next.</p>
      <p>If Blachowicz loses, he'll be looking at a UFC record of 7-6 and will have lost the most momentum he has ever had, coming off a knockout win against <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2519811/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a>. If Souza is the loser, he'll be staring at (remarkably) the first losing streak of his career -- and possibly retirement.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, the significance of a win in MMA can be as much about maintaining one's place in line as it is about improving it -- and that's the position Blachowicz and Souza find themselves in here. Each really has more to lose than to gain in this fight, at least in the short term. And they have plenty to lose.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I didn't want to do anything anymore. I would go to the gym and start crying because I didn't want to be there. I didn't feel like it."</p>
      <p>That was Souza speaking to Gustavo Faldon of ESPN Brazil about the aftermath of his April loss to <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3074102/jack-hermansson">Jack Hermansson</a>. It was an eye-opening acknowledgement, especially for someone in the just-tough-it-out fight game. But Souza had just seen his middleweight stock go <i>splat</i>. Going into the Hermansson fight, Souza was on the verge of a title shot. Afterward, he was nowhere.</p>
      <p>At the urging of his wife, Souza saw a psychologist, who, Souza said, diagnosed him with burnout syndrome, a stress-related disorder that plagues a person with overwhelming mental and physical exhaustion.</p>
      <p>"I didn't practice for three months," said Souza. "I slept four hours a night. I did everything that an athlete cannot do. I drank soda at 2 a.m. I felt like sleeping, but I could not. I did not get out of bed. I got to the point where I went to the gym but could not come in. I would just stay there in the parking lot and return home."</p>
      <p>Now, after months of treatment and rest, Souza is back in the game -- at a new weight class. He is using this fresh start at light heavyweight to rein in his expectations. Don't even ask about a title shot.</p>
      <p>"I'm not even thinking about it," he said. "I am taking one step at a time. My goal is to train hard and win the fight."</p>
      <h3>Fighting words</h3>
      <p>"I am focused on Jacare now. After that, I do not see any option other than Jones. After I am done with Jacare, I will defeat Jon Jones."<br/><i>--Blachowicz, speaking to ESPN Brazil</i></p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Brett Okamoto's prediction</h3>
      <p>History is not on Souza's side here (at least, from what we've seen in 2019). He will be the third high-profile middleweight to test the waters at a higher weight class this year, and thus far the experiment hasn't ended well. Former champions <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2519811/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2553993/chris-weidman">Chris Weidman</a> were both brutally knocked out in their UFC light heavyweight debuts. The circumstances around the three moves up from 185 pounds were all different, of course, but I predict a similar result here. <b>Blachowicz via TKO, third round.</b></p>
      <h3>Waiting in the wings</h3>
      <p>Blachowicz seems to think <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335639/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> is waiting for him, but the champ has given no such indication. In fact, Jones has been <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/mma/story/_/id/28052117/jon-jones-vs-dominick-reyes-twitter-tussle-lead-title-fight">courting a fight with </a><a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4233039/dominick-reyes">Dominick Reyes</a>, leaving Blachowicz and other top light heavyweight contenders (<a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3112020/corey-anderson">Corey Anderson</a>, most notably) to sort things out among themselves.</p>

        <b>The co-main event: What makes 'Shogun' a legend</b>
      </p>
      <p>The term "legend" is tossed around loosely sometimes, almost to the point that it loses its impact. But <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335514/mauricio-rua">Mauricio "Shogun" Rua</a>, who faces <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3946951/paul-craig">Paul Craig</a> on Saturday, has the credentials to back it up.</p>
      <p>1. He is already in the UFC Hall of Fame, or at least one of his fights is. Among the 2018 inductees was <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player?id=d3f3c1f7-c324-4bc3-8f8f-a0614d9cceff">Rua's classic 2011 rock-'em-sock-'em fight</a> with <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335497/dan-henderson">Dan Henderson</a> -- not to be confused with his classic 2014 rock-'em-sock-'em rematch with Henderson.</p>
      <p>2. He has won eight UFC postfight bonuses: three for Knockout of the Night (vs. <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335464/chuck-liddell">Chuck Liddell</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335524/lyoto-machida">Lyoto Machida</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2951480/james-te-huna">James Te-Huna</a>), four for Fight of the Night (vs. <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335515/mark-coleman">Mark Coleman</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2381659/rogerio-nogueira">Antonio Rogerio Nogueira</a> and Henderson twice) and one for Performance of the Night (vs. <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4071969/tyson-pedro">Tyson Pedro</a>).</p>
      <p>3. He's a former UFC light heavyweight champion, as well as the winner of the 2005 Pride Middleweight Grand Prix; within the span of four months, he defeated <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335470/quinton-jackson">Quinton Jackson</a>, Nogueira, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335516/alistair-overeem">Alistair Overeem</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335520/ricardo-arona">Ricardo Arona</a> -- and all but "Lil Nog" by knockout.</p>
      <p>4. His 14 knockdowns as a UFC light heavyweight are by far the most among active 205-pounders (the next most are <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2500771/alexander-gustafsson">Alexander Gustafsson</a>'s nine). "Shogun" is tied with Liddell for the most all time in the division.</p>
      <p>5. Rua has 1,108 total strikes in the UFC, the third-most all time at light heavyweight, putting him behind just <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335639/jon-jones">Jon Jones</a> (1,728) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335472/tito-ortiz">Tito Ortiz</a> (1,241).</p>
      <p>6. His 24 takedowns leave him No. 3 among active light heavyweights, behind <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3112020/corey-anderson">Corey Anderson</a> (53) and Jones (40).</p>
      <p>7. A win by KO or TKO on Saturday would tie "Shogun" with Liddell for the most in the UFC's modern-era light heavyweight history.</p>

      <p>Some undercard offerings from Andrew Davis of ESPN Stats &amp; Information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504169/charles-oliveira">Charles Oliveira</a>, who faces <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3894823/jared-gordon">Jared Gordon</a> on the main card, is the UFC's leader in submission wins, with 13. Oliveira's last fight, against <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2504229/nik-lentz">Nik Lentz</a> in May, ended not in a tapout but in the first KO/TKO win of his UFC career.</li>
        <li>If you like submissions, this could be the event for you. Besides Oliveira, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3108775/warlley-alves">Warlley Alves</a> has won three UFC fights by guillotine; one more will tie him for the record with <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335679/nate-diaz">Nate Diaz</a> and Oliveira (unless "Do Bronx" gets one, too). <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2516135/francisco-trinaldo">Francisco Trinaldo</a> has won two UFC fights by arm triangle; one more will give him the record. And <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3946951/paul-craig">Paul Craig</a> has won two UFC fights by triangle choke; one more will give him the record. Craig would also tie the light heavyweight record for most submission wins with five.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4565792/eduardo-garagorri">Eduardo Garagorri</a> of Uruguay is the only undefeated fighter on the card, at 13-0. Garagorri will be looking to go 2-0 in the UFC when he faces <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3571515/ricardo-ramos">Ricardo Ramos</a> on the prelims. If Garagorri wins, he'll tie <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/3955238/shamil-gamzatov">Shamil Gamzatov</a> for the third-best record among active UFC fighters, behind <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2611557/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> (28-0) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4285679/israel-adesanya">Israel Adesanya</a> (18-0).</li>
        <li>Ricardo Ramos is making his featherweight debut after putting up a 4-1 UFC record at bantamweight. Ramos recently came in at No. 10 on ESPN's list of the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/mma/story/_/id/27807201/the-top-25-mma-fighters-25">top 25 MMA fighters under the age of 25</a>. Ramos will not turn 25 until Aug. 1, 2020.</li>
        <li>Francisco Trinaldo will be making his 20th UFC appearance, with a UFC-record 15 of those coming in Brazil. The 41-year-old out of Brasilia is 11-3 in his UFC career in his home country, winning his last two fights there.</li>
        <li>This card is filled with Brazilian fighters. There is a Brazilian in each of the 12 fights, and overall, there are 15 Brazilians on the card. If a Brazilian wins in every fight, it would tie the record for most wins by Brazilian fighters on a UFC card. That record was set on the May 2013 card in Jaraguá do Sul that was headlined by <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2354057/vitor-belfort">Vitor Belfort</a>'s win over <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2519811/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a>. The record was tied three weeks later at the June 2013 card in Fortaleza featuring <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2354533/fabricio-werdum">Fabricio Werdum</a>'s win over <a href="http://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335521/antonio-rodrigo-nogueira">Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira</a>.</li>
