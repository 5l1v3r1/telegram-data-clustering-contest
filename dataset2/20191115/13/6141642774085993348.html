      <p>Comedian Al Murray is urging people to sign the blood stem cell register after his nephew was struck by leukaemia.</p>
      <p>Six-year-old Finley Relf has a rare and aggressive form of the disease and his only hope of a cure is a bone marrow transplant.</p>
      <p>Finley’s parents Ben and Nicky Relf sought medical help after noticing that their son was losing weight.</p>
      <p>He was diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood disorder that occurs in young children.</p>
      <p>The youngster, from Haywards Heath, West Sussex, is having chemotherapy at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p>
      <p>Murray’s partner Eleanor Relf is Ben Relf’s sister.</p>
      <blockquote>He's critically ill, there is a 50/50 chance of him surviving this basically, and without the transplant, there is no cure for JMML.<cite>Al Murray</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Murray told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme: “Finley is undergoing chemotherapy but his best chance of fighting the disease is a bone marrow transplant.</p>
      <p>“He has JMML, a super-rare leukaemia and 12 kids a year get it probably, and he needs a blood stem cell transplant.”</p>
      <p>Murray said Finley was undergoing “gruelling” treatment but was a “chirpy six-year-old who wants to run around and go swimming”.</p>
      <p>“He’s critically ill, there is a 50/50 chance of him surviving this basically, and without the transplant, there is no cure for JMML.”</p>
      <p>Murray said Finley needs a transplant “before Christmas, this has got to happen right away”.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Pearce, chief executive of the blood stem cell charity DKMS, which is looking for a donor for Finley, said: “Even though we are working with Al Murray in very sad and serious circumstances, he is doing fantastic work with us to highlight that only 2% of the UK population are on the blood stem registry.</p>
      <p>“We desperately need more people to come forward as donors if we’re to find a match for every person with blood cancer.</p>
      <p>“Blood cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the UK, and at any one time there are around 2,000 people in the UK in need of a blood stem cell transplant.</p>
      <p>“I would urge anyone between 17 and 55 and in general good health to request a swab kit from dkms.org.uk so we can help find a match for Al’s nephew Finley and all the other people that need one.”</p>
