      <p>A few months back, jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman was preparing a set list for his quartet.</p>
      <p>Having an abundance of good material to choose from certainly falls into “good-problem-to-have” territory. Still, narrowing it down for his long-running ensemble has proven quite a chore, Redman says.</p>
      <p>“I had all this music that we had played in the past in a book and had another 20 or 25 new songs,” he says. “The books were literally too big. The music was falling off the music stand. The thing is, I’m horrible at making set lists. I like to call tunes from the bandstand. I might start off with an idea of what we might play but I’ll change things up. We’re improvising, so I never know what the arc of a certain song is going to be, what is going to feel right in the next moment. It’s just logistically impossible to call audibles when we’ve got 60 tunes.”</p>
      <p>The fact that Redman has built up such a formidable “book” or canon isn’t surprising. He is the son of free jazz great Dewey Redman, who played sax for Keith Jarrett and Ornette Coleman and led the jazz group Old and New Dreams alongside trumpeter Don Cherry. But while Joshua Redman’s near 30-year run as a sax player and bandleader may seem genetically predetermined, he says he initially had no plans of following in his father’s footsteps.</p>
      <p>In 1991, he had graduated from Harvard and was planning to head to Yale to study law. But jazz got in the way. A few months after graduating from Harvard, he entered the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition. Much to his surprise, he won. By that point he had moved to New York, where he still lives, and into a house with a bunch of fellow musicians. His father, who passed away in 2006, invited him to join his band.</p>
      <p>“I was loving playing music, especially playing music with some of the greatest musicians in the world,” he says. “But still, when I was in the competition it wasn’t something where I thought I was … going to go on to a career in music. I realized in early 1992 that I had been in New York for six months. I was playing and starting to tour and was like ‘Wow, I want to do this for awhile.’ But I didn’t think I wanted to do it for the rest of my life. I didn’t think I could do it for the rest of my life.”</p>
      <p>He wrote to officials at Yale and asked if he could extend his deferment.</p>
      <p>“They sent me back a very polite but very terse letter saying ‘Thanks for your interest in Yale Law School. If you wish to attend in the future, please consider reapplying,’” Redman says with laugh. “It was at that point where I was like ‘I guess I’m not going to law school, at least not now. I guess I’m a professional musician.”</p>
      <p>By 1993, he had released his self-titled debut for Warner Brothers, which earned him his first Grammy nomination. He has remained fairly prolific ever since. In May, he reunited with pianist Aaron Goldberg, bassist Reuben Rogers, and drummer Gregory Hutchinson as the Joshua Redman Quartet to record Come What May. Redman first recorded with the outfit for 2000’s Beyond, but hadn’t released anything under that name for nearly two decades. The seven Redman originals on Come What May mixes elements of funk, swing and soul into the quartet’s highly improvised jazz framework.</p>
      <p>“This is, I guess, our Round 2 in terms of more intensive work together,” says Redman, who will be leading the quartet for a Calgary show on Nov. 19 at the Jack Singer Concert Hall. “A lot of times with projects now it’s just a matter of bringing a song in and seeing how it fits with a particular group of musicians at a particular time. The thing that’s great about Aaron, Reuben and Greg is that they have such musical instincts and know how to take just about any piece of music — even a flawed piece of music, of which I have many — and highlight the strengths.”</p>
