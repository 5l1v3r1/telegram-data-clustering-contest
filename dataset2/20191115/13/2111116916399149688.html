      <p>The Jabra Elite 75t <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-true-wireless-earbuds-the-best-airpod-alternatives-around">true wireless earbuds</a> are finally available to buy after being launched in September – and they've already been given their first discount in a great <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday deal</a>. </p>
      <p>Originally set to cost $200, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2018">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon</a> have slashed the price by $20, bringing them down to $179.99 – a quick check of Amazon showed us that they were indeed listed at $199.95 on October 30. </p>

      <h4>An AirPods alternative</h4>
      <p>The new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/the-best-wireless-earbuds-available-today-1327335">wireless earbuds</a> build on the success of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds">Jabra Elite 65t</a>, which we awarded 4.5 out of 5 stars <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds">when we reviewed them</a> last year. </p>
      <p>Jabra says improvements included "notably longer batter life, and a smaller, more secure comfortable fit". Battery life has certainly improved since the Elite 65t, rising from five hours to seven-and-a-half hours.</p>
      <p>That number's bumped up to 28 hours in total by the charging case. That battery life beats the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-airpods-2019-review">Apple AirPods</a> and the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-review">AirPods Pro</a>, which only offer five hours of playback from the earbuds themselves, and an additional 20 from their charging case.  </p>
      <p>Thanks to four inbuilt microphones, you can take phone calls with these true wireless earbuds, as well as speaking to your device's smart assistant; simply press one of the touch sensitive housings to summon Siri, Alexa, or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/google-assistant-how-to-make-your-google-home-speaker-work-for-you">Google Assistant</a>. </p>
      <p>Looking for something a little cheaper? The previous model, the Jabra Elite 65t are also discounted by $20 at Best Buy. Battery life isn't quite as good as the new model, but they're still a solid choice thanks to their balanced soundstage and understated design. </p>
