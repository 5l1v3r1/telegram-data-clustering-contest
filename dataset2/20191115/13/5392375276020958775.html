      <p>On October 31st, Chinese phone maker Smartisan officially announced the new <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/31/smartisan-nut-pro-3-announced-system-is-the-biggest-highlight/">Smartisan Nut Pro 3</a> flagship phone and as we said back then, the handset has its main selling point in this operative system. Today, the brand pushed out an update for the device, updating its OS to Smartisan OS 7.12. The new OS version adds a Step 3.0 sidebar split screen function; let’s have a closer look!</p>

      <p>The Step 3.0 feature by Smartisan is basically a new take at the split screen enigma. This feature comes into action by pulling down from the two corners at the top of the screen, or it can be activated by pressing the shortcut and volume down buttons at the same time.</p>
      <p>Once the split screen interface is started, it’s possible to choose the main app along with three sub-apps. In other words, we have a large portion of the screen used by an app; while the other three apps share a smaller part of the display.</p>
      <p>This allows users to have a total of four apps running at the same time. Although it’d probably be worth starting a discussion on the actual usability of this configuration.</p>

      <p>Chinese media suggests that this software feature also pushed the brand to avoid making a 6GB RAM variant. The Smartisan Nut Pro 3 is indeed only available with a minimum of 8GB. Plus there’s even a 12GB for those who take multi-tasking very seriously.</p>
      <p>Needless to say that with the large amount of RAM, there shouldn’t be any memory-related problems.</p>

      <p>But the new Nut Pro 3 isn’t the only device getting this feature. The older Nut R1 and Nut Pro 2S are supposedly going to receive the update as well. Smartisan OS 7.2 in its stable version should land on the two devices in early 2020.</p>
