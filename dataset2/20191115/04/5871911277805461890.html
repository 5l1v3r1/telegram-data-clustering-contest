      <h1>Kristaps Porzingis hilariously forgets which locker room was his, nearly followed Knicks in</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:38:46+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>Mavericks big man Kristaps Porzingis had spent the entirety of his career playing for the Knicks up until he was traded back in February, and apparently, he still feels to believe the friendly confines of Madison Square Garden are home, at least on some level.</p>
      <p>Fans sure didn’t make him feel that way, as they <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/14/knicks-boo-heckle-kristaps-porzingis-with-a-hole-chants/">booed him both before and during</a> the game — even breaking out an <a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/14/knicks-boo-heckle-kristaps-porzingis-with-a-hole-chants/">“a–hole” chant</a> at one point in the game (<a href="https://thesportsdaily.com/2019/11/14/knicks-boo-heckle-kristaps-porzingis-with-a-hole-chants/">watch here</a>).</p>
      <p>As for Porzingis, though, well, he nearly walked to the Knicks locker room at halftime, as this funny clip shows.</p>
