      <p>Lottery multi-millionaire <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-lotto-winner-gillian-bayford-19014234">Gillian Bayford’s</a> trial for repeatedly attacking her domestic abuse campaigner ex-boyfriend has been put off until next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-euromillions-winner-gillian-bayford-13782681">Bayford</a>, 47, had been due to stand trial next month but the date has been moved after a delay relating to evidence held in her phone.</p>
      <p>The former hospital cleaner – who <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/euromillions-winner-set-lose-270k-18854320">shared a £148million EuroMillions win</a> with ex-husband Adrian in 2012 before separating 15 months later – faces a single charge of domestic assault against Gavin Innes, 46, while they were dating in 2017.</p>

      <p>At a procedural hearing at Dundee Sheriff Court yesterday, solicitor advocate Neil Hay, for Bayford, said both the Crown and the defence were agreed that the case would again not be ready for trial when planned.</p>
      <p>He said: “The position today is largely the same – evidence which was sought from the Crown in August has still not been disclosed to the defence.”</p>
      <p>In August the case was put off to give time for “an IT and telephony expert” to examine a mobile phone, which is in the hands of the <br/>prosecution. Prosecutor Isobel Vincent said “one of the issues” was still the phone.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sheriff Michael Fletcher agreed to postpone the trial to March 3, and ordered a further preliminary hearing on February 13.</p>
      <p>Bayford, of Broughty Ferry, Dundee, denies the charge.</p>
