      <p>4 p.m.</p>
      <p>Authorities say the biography on an Instagram account believed to belong to the gunman who killed two students at his California high school said, "Saugus, have fun at school tomorrow."</p>
      <p>Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say the message was posted Thursday morning but it's unclear when. They say it was later removed, and they don't know who made the change.</p>
      <p>Authorities say off-duty officers whose children went to Saugus High School in Santa Clarita were the first on scene and provided first aid to the victims.</p>
      <p>A 16-year-old student shot five classmates and then himself. It's unclear if they had any relationship, and a motive is unknown. The shooter is in grave condition.</p>
      <p>The FBI says there's no reason to believe he was acting on behalf of a group or ideology or that there were any conspirators.</p>
