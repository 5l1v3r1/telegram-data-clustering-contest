      <p>The customs and excise office in Denpasar destroyed illegal goods worth more than IDR1.7 billion (US$121,107) on Wednesday, comprising items that the agency has seized since January and includes sex toys, cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.</p>
      <p>“Until now we are still finding many taxable goods that are sold without excise tapes or labeled with fake ones in Bali,” Abdul Kharis, who heads the Customs and Excise Supervision and Service Office (KPPBC) in Denpasar, <a href="https://bali.antaranews.com/berita/169599/bea-cukai-denpasar-musnahkan-barang-senilai-rp17-miliar">told reporters this week.</a></p>
      <p>As reported by <i>Tribun-Bali</i>, <a href="https://bali.tribunnews.com/2019/11/14/47-unit-sex-toys-dari-china-dibakar-bea-cukai-musnahkan-ribuan-botol-miras-dan-liquid-vape?page=all">the items include 47 units of sex toys</a> that were allegedly sent from China, 157 liquid vape bottles, and 626 bottles of alcohol. There are also cosmetics as well as electronic and health-related goods among them. </p>

      <p>The items were seized between January and August of this year, and most of it during screening of goods delivered from abroad. Abdul said many of these items had been purchased online and are worth IDR1.7 billion in total. </p>
      <p>According to authorities, the items had incurred a state loss of IDR 1.3 billion.</p>
      <p>“We [destroy the items] by burning, cutting, breaking, pouring and burying them onto the ground, with the intent of damaging them and destroying their functions,” Abdul explained. </p>
      <p>We’re not sure what purpose destroying sex toys serves other than possibly robbing some people of their orgasms. But, of course, Indonesian authorities love to make public spectacles of destroying illegal goods, like that time <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3017682/Entire-town-Tangerang-gets-high-marijuana-fumes-Indonesian-police-burn-three-ton-pile-drug.html">they burned a pile of seized marijuana in West Jakarta</a>, which made people in the area feel “dizzy.”</p>
