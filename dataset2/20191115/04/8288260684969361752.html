      <h3>Morelos' agent speaks out</h3>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos’ agent has told interested clubs to go and get the Rangers striker before his value skyrockets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/aston-villa-transfer-news-morelos-17257224">Aston Villa have been heavily linked with the Colombia international</a> who has already rattled in 22 goals this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> are finalising their plans for the January transfer window and Morelos has <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alfredo-morelos-aston-villa-transfer-17056862">done little to quell speculation about a potential move to the Premier League when asked about his future in interviews.</a></p>
      <p>He is said to be valued at around £20m at Ibrox and the 23-year-old’s agent, Theofilos Karasavvidis, thinks a fee like that would represent a bargain.</p>

      <h3>VAR meeting</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa chief executive Christian Purslow says ‘grave concerns’ about video assistant referee (VAR) technology were raised at a Premier League meeting on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Purslow was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa’s</a> representative at a conference held between top-flight clubs to discuss the use of VAR.</p>
      <p>Referees' chief Mike Riley led the discussion over the technology, which has caused weekly controversy since its introduction in the league at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>Purslow told Sky Sports: “I’ve got grave concerns, but so has everybody in the room. We had a very robust discussion."</p>

      <h3>Fans urge Villa to sign Giroud</h3>
      <p>Chelsea are reportedly putting striker Olivier Giroud up for sale at a cut-price fee.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> fans think their club should go straight in for the forward.</p>
      <p>Giroud is out of the picture under new Chelsea boss Frank Lampard, starting just one match in the Premier League this season with former Villa loanee <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tammy-abraham">Tammy Abraham</a> leading the line.</p>
      <p>Antonio Conte, who brought him to Stamford Bridge in January 2018, is set to try and sign him again according to Italian media.</p>
      <p>And Chelsea are thought to be letting him go for just £6 million.</p>

      <h3>Nyland interview</h3>
      <p>Orjan Nyland says he will fight Tom Heaton to become Aston Villa's number one goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian made his first appearance since December 29 at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on Sunday, coming on for the injured Jed Steer after just seven minutes at Molineux.</p>
      <p>Nyland had previously been limited to Under-23s outings this season until Tom Heaton picked up a calf injury before the Wolves game <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-vilal-orjan-nyland-wolves-17246088">and was treated to an appearance on the substitute's bench</a> for the West Midlands derby.</p>
      <p>He was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> 's number one last season having been signed from Ingoldstadt in summer 2018 but he suffered an Achilles injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season.</p>

      <h3>Frustration</h3>
      <p>Aberdeen's Scott McKenna has told of his transfer frustrations at being denied a move away from Pittodrie.</p>
      <p>The Scotland defender was an <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> target last year and sought to leave the Scottish Premiership side in the summer for the Championship with Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers interested.</p>
      <p>Celtic <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-celtic-wolves-mckenna-15517255">were also said to be interested in the 23-year-old</a> , who submitted a transfer request as he tried to force through a move south of the border.</p>
      <p>In the end it didn't materialise, with Derek McInnes keen to keep hold of the impressive centre-back.</p>

      <h3>Phillips clause</h3>
      <p>Kalvin Phillips has a release clause in his contract allowing him to leave if Leeds United don’t win promotion, according to Noel Whelan.</p>
      <p>Phillips, 23, has been linked with a move to the Premier League after becoming a mainstay of Marcelo Bielsa’s side at Elland Road.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> were firmly interested during the summer transfer window when Phillips was a leading target after the play-off triumph in May.</p>
      <p>But they couldn’t agree a fee with Leeds, who rejected bids, and the midfielder stayed put for another shot at promotion with his boyhood club.</p>
