      <p>I was born in St John of God Hospital, Subiaco, to two alright people, who turned out to be pretty amazing parents.</p>
      <p>They'd met in Kalgoorlie where Dad had grown up and had to decide between choosing to buy a not so nice house in an even not so nicer suburb in Kalgoorlie, or to build a modest, brand new house in Esperance, that was close to a beach.</p>
      <p>No surprise as to what they chose! So, soon after my arrival the house was finished and the three of us moved in.</p>
      <p>They could have stopped at me - I mean, when you've already attained perfection, why keep trying, but two more sisters followed, both of whom rapidly and successfully set about growing taller than me. I soon became known as the Little Big Sister.</p>
      <p>As sisters we mostly played games where I was the Princess and they were the slaves, and many other versions with similar themes where I was always the Master or Boss. I'm sure they loved it!</p>
      <p>As a family we did a bit of travelling, camping, beaching, jogging with the newly formed South- East Runners Club, and frequently put on performances for Mum and Dad- and any of their friends unlucky enough to be around - that I had usually written or made up. Both my sisters and I loved Le Petit Bijou and auditioned every year.</p>
      <p>As you can tell I was an extremely shy child, who never liked attention, always tried to hide in the shadows, hardly ever said a word and always put the thoughts and feelings of everyone else ahead of my own. * (I don't think I have ever written a more outrageous and untrue sentence).</p>
      <p>I went to Castletown Primary, even before Mrs Grewar was principal, but she was a teacher there when I started Year 1.</p>
      <p>There were things I liked about school, especially reading and writing, but I was the kind of student who did reasonably well without trying, and had no desire to apply myself.</p>
      <p>Coasting was just fine by me; a habit I didn't grow out of transitioning into high school. It only got worse. I don't think I was very nice to some of my teachers, though I remember having some good ones and funny ones.</p>
      <p>If I was to guess one word many would have used to describe me it would be exasperating, if I'm being kind, and something a lot worse if I'm not.</p>
      <p>Advice I'd now give a 12 year old me would be to be a better student.</p>
      <p>I'd probably be ten years further along in life if I had, but then my journey would have been different and I wouldn't be the me I am now, and for all my faults I really like me and who I am.</p>
      <p>The other advice I would give, and do give myself now is:</p>
      <p><b>1</b>. You know what you know. If you shut up and listen you might learn what others know.</p>
      <p><b>2. </b>If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room. Surround yourself with people you can learn from.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> You can learn something from everyone - even if it's how not to do something.</p>

      <p>After leaving school I spent a year saving before back-packing overseas for a year before returning to Esperance for a few more years.</p>
      <p>I left again at 24 to live with my best friend since kindy, Wendy Sealey, who was in Albury-Wodonga.</p>
      <p>It was only supposed to be for a couple of months, but ended up being two years and included a stint at Falls Creek for a snow season.</p>
      <p>Broke and wanting to come home, I took a job in Kalgoorlie. The plan was to save for 3 months then get back to Esperance, but 15 years later I'm still here.</p>
      <p>Kalgoorlie has been very good to me, though I go back to Esperance all the time. You just don't find those kinds of beaches anywhere else.</p>
      <p>Most of my employment before 2005 was in hospitality; bars, restaurants, functions, events etc until I got a start at the radio station, primarily marketing and sales, but also learning to panel, copyright commercials, doing some on air stuff including segments, interviews and a 12 episode radio play. I loved my 13 years at Triple M/RadioWest.</p>
      <p>In 2008, I looked at my life and realised I needed more, so I set two goals for the year:</p>
      <p><b>1. </b>Say yes more.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Have more things to say yes to.</p>
      <p>I thought about giving theatre another go, then subsequently talked myself out of trying for any of the auditions I saw advertised... until The Repertory Club's Little Shop Of Horrors.</p>
      <p>I found many reasons not to try out for that one too, but somehow found myself there on the first night, nervous and scared, despite everyone being super nice. I ended up getting my first solo singing role, ever, and had an absolute blast.</p>
      <p>I have often referred to the decision to go to that audition as a 'crossroads moment', as almost everything that has happened since, friends I've met, performance opportunities and skill building can be traced back to that moment.</p>
      <p>After that first show I teched for Stage Left's first production, Are You Being Served? which cemented me on the theatrical and stage hogging path of many other productions, special events, writing projects and parties (Oh! The parties!) at both clubs.</p>
      <p>I also met my first singing coach this way.</p>
      <p>Theatre then led to The Comedy Hour and becoming a stand-up comedian in my own right (another something I thought I'd never do. Ever!).</p>
      <p>And in the years since that one little audition, even more creative projects seem to find their way to me, which is both incredible and humbling.</p>
      <p>Thanks to all these other influences I get to act (adequately), sing (marginally better), and dance (atrociously). And I love any chance I get to perform, whatever the format.</p>

      <p>Then came 2014...A Vestibular Schwanomma is the fancy name for a big, scary, white blob in your head that's putting pressure on your brain and being diagnosed with one put a bit of a crimp in my plans.</p>
      <p>This particular schwanomma measured 32mm by 25mm by 27mm and I named it Earnest, mostly because it was found 'nesting' behind my ear and Earnest sounded a lot less terrifying than tumor!</p>
      <p>I had a ten week wait before the operation, six hours on the operating table, one week in hospital, and close to six months before I was really back to full strength.</p>
      <p>Earnest ruined the hearing and balance nerves on my right side and played havoc with my facial nerve, leaving me deaf on one side, the balance of a drunk person even when I'm sober, and a face that looked like Picasso had painted it, but with years of physio most of the movement has come back, and it's more like I have Mona Lisa's smile now.</p>
      <p>When I did properly recover I went back to writing.</p>
      <p>I was determined to finish some of my many works in the Drawer of Unfinished Projects, including two novels that I was going to finish, right up until a particular conversation with a friend that sparked the idea for Original Sin (available at the Esperance Book Box), which I immediately knew I had to write first.</p>
      <p>Writing at night after a full day of work, over weekends and sometimes when it was quiet at my full time job, it took four years to get Original Sin ready to publish.</p>
      <p>It was wonderful being able to have an Esperance launch and reconnect with so many people.</p>
      <p>I am currently writing my second novel, a thriller, set in the Goldfields called Dire Conditions and hope to launch it in February.</p>
      <p>My future, I hope, will contain many more books, stories and creative projects.</p>
      <p>I love Esperance and it was a wonderful place to grow up. My ideal life would be to spend 3-6 months of the year living in Esperance with the rest of the year travelling (and writing).</p>
      <p>I'm hoping that achieving my dream to be an author will help my hopes become reality.</p>
