      <p>ROME: Venetians on Thursday (Nov 14) were adamant, despite millions of euros of damage from days of flooding, that they are determined to remain in their lagoon city no matter what.</p>
      <p>Matteo Rado would usually spend his day looking after his restaurant buzzing with tourists enjoying the view of the main waterfront a stone's throw from Saint Mark's Basilica.</p>

      <p>But on Thursday the Hotel Savoia &amp; Jolanda restaurant remained closed, taking stock after being battered by the second highest tide recorded in the city's history, causing at least €70,000 (US$77,000) of damage to the business.</p>
      <p>Like many other lifelong Venetians, Rado is defiant, saying he will stay in his beloved city even if the water continues to rise.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we are still counting the extent of the damage and we are still try to fix parts of the electricity," Rado told Reuters. "We threw away around €1,000 (US$1,100) of food because it was all in a large fridge that filled with salt water," he said.</p>
      <p>But has he considered giving up and moving out?</p>
      <p>"To say: 'that's enough of Venice'? Never."</p>
      <p>Local authorities declared the city a disaster zone on Wednesday after "apocalyptic" floods inundated its historic basilica, squares and hundreds of centuries-old buildings.</p>
      <p>Central government declared a state of emergency for Venice on Thursday, allocating €20 million (US$22 million) to address the immediate damage.</p>
      <p>But many in the local community play down the problems.</p>
      <p>"The sea is our life, and also the floods," explained hotel manager Jacopo Derai.</p>
      <p>"It's already over from what I see here, we had a hard time of course, but it's not forever, it's for a few hours, and of course we need to consider that this could happen again so we need to be prepared - we need to go on," he said.</p>
      <p>Further along the lagoon, bar owner Begnamino Dal Mas says living with the threat of floods, or "high water" as the Italians call it, is a part of Venetian life.</p>
      <p>"We have to live with this. But when it is too high, it starts to be quite difficult," he said.</p>
      <p>Even as cleaning up is taking place, one eye is kept on the next high tide.</p>
      <p>On Friday another flood is possible, but the Venetians are preparing to brave the storm and get back onto their feet - whatever the weather.</p>
