      <p>A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: "River flooding is expected to continue in the Lower River Don washland area of south Yorkshire through to at least Monday, where properties will continue to flood and there will be continued travel disruption.</p>
      <p>"Also, river flooding is probable on Friday for the River Derwent in Derbyshire and the River Trent in Nottinghamshire on Friday. Properties could flood and there could be travel disruption."</p>
      <p>Further flooding is possible across north-east and central England and Wales today.</p>
      <p>The south-west and east of England could also see flooding.</p>

      <p>Almost 50mm of rain fell near Tal-y-Maes, Wales, in the 24 hours to Thursday evening, and the 49.6mm recorded in Brecknockshire was almost matched by Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, which saw 48.8mm over the same period.</p>
      <p>Steven Keates, forecaster at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> , said rain was falling from Humberside, down to Devon and Cornwall, and when asked for Thursday night's outlook, said: "Here we go again.</p>
      <p>"The same as what we had a week ago, persistent rain across that central part of the UK, falling on already saturated ground."</p>
      <p>The rain arrived alongside cold temperatures in some place, as parts of the South West of England did not manage to climb above two degrees on Thursday, but floodwater remains the primary concern.</p>

      <p>Mr Keates added: "There is a mix of snow in there, but it's not causing any major problems.</p>
      <p>"It's all about the rain."</p>
      <p>Machines were pumping 2.5 tonnes of water per second out of the Yorkshire village of Fishlake, according to the Environment Agency, as British Army soldiers helped reinforce flood defences.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, emergency services across England warned people to be careful and not drive through deep floodwater as rivers continued to swell.</p>

      <p>More than 800 properties have been affected by the floodwaters so far, and people have been evacuated in Bentley and Fishlake.</p>
      <p>Another Government Cobra meeting was held on Thursday evening to co-ordinate the ongoing relief.</p>
      <p>The leaders of councils in Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield, Barnsley, Bassetlaw and Kirklees have written to communities secretary Robert Jenrick.</p>

      <p>The council chiefs warned of "considerable and lasting damage" and urging more funding to help them cope with future flooding, the Guardian reported.</p>
      <p>One woman found her bus ride was interrupted on Thursday afternoon as black floodwater streamed into the vehicle, near Lydney in Gloucestershire.</p>
      <p>Stacey Gunter, from Bream, told the PA news agency: "All the water rushed up through the door as we went through the floodwaters. <br/>"It was kind of nervous laughter all around. Poor old ladies couldn't get their feet off the ground quick enough."</p>
