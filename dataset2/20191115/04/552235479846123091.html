      <h1>Appalling legacy of austerity should make Tories hang their heads in shame</h1>
      <h2>Record View slams the extreme poverty pushing vulnerable people to the absolute limit.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:30:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>Extreme poverty is pushing vulnerable people to the absolute limit.</p>
      <p>And some women are resorting to so-called “survival sex” to makes ends meet.</p>
      <p>It’s a disgusting term for a deeply distressing social scandal that no society should allow.</p>
      <p>Poverty is forcing women to turn to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/prostitution">prostitution</a>, and the UK Government is being told to shoulder the blame.</p>
      <p>Women first raised this awful situation with MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee at Westminster.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> foodbank has been contacted by police to support woman selling themselves because of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/poverty">poverty</a>.</p>

      <p>And in Holyrood yesterday, the Scottish Government were asked to do something about it.</p>
      <p>Equalities minister Christina McKelvie said the label alone was enough to make her blood run cold.</p>
      <p>She said the UK Government need to fix problems with benefits, and hand over responsibilities to Holyrood.</p>
      <p>Transferring powers is not enough on its own, of course.</p>
      <p>To make a difference, something has to change to alleviate poverty and break any link between financial desperation and prostitution.</p>
      <p>Tory <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/iain-duncan-smith">Iain Duncan Smith</a> famously wept when he saw the impact of poverty in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>, and promised to do something about it.</p>
      <p>Since then, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Tories</a> have presided over harsh austerity that punished the poorest.</p>
      <p>They have left an appalling legacy and should hang their heads in shame.</p>

      <h3>Poll position</h3>
      <p>Professor Sir John Curtice is the polling world’s top boffin so when the election expert speaks, we listen.</p>
      <p>In his fascinating assessment of the election, Curtice has put Scotland in the eye of the political storm and it could be crucial to Boris Johnson’s chances of sneaking back in the door to Downing Street with a majority.</p>
      <p>It could also be the place that breaks the back of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to form a majority Labour government.</p>

      <p>As we can see from the harrowing testimony of people who have suffered years of Tory austerity, one of these outcomes is highly undesirable.</p>
      <p>Whichever side of the constitutional debate you come down on, nothing could be more important than coming out to vote on December 12 to ensure that Scotland becomes a Tory-free zone.</p>
      <h3>Level Up</h3>
      <p>Congratulations to 18-year-old Liam McCarron.</p>
      <p>Illness forced him to take a year off school - so he spent the time perfecting his computer gaming skills.</p>
      <p>Now he’s a world champion gamer.</p>
      <p>But for any teenage boys reading this, remember and stick in at school - as very few people get to make a living playing on their Xbox or PlayStation.</p>
