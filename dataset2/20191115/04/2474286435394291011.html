      <h1>Drought forgotten as the district enjoyed a harvest under the stars at Bellata</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:38:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:38</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Harris</a></address>
      <p>The worries of the drought were forgotten for a night as the Bellata, Moree, Narrabri and surrounding communities came together for a different type of "harvest" this year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6463720/down-but-not-out-bellata-community-prepare-for-harvest-under-the-stars-take-two/">second annual Harvest Under the Stars event</a> was once again a huge success, as about 250 people from across the region enjoyed a night out at Bellata Golf Club on Saturday, November 9.</p>
      <p>"It went off well," organiser Drew Penberthy said.</p>
      <p>"It was a relaxed night; we had good reports from everyone. We had a lot of people ring up afterwards and say 'thank you, it was good to get out and catch up with people'."</p>
      <p>Two bus-loads of people from Narrabri and a bus-load from Moree attended Harvest Under the Stars 2.0, along with a local bus full of Bellata residents. People also travelled from some of the other small villages in the Moree and Narrabri shires.</p>
      <p>Mr Penberthy is hopeful that next year there won't be another Harvest Under the Stars, at least not at this time of the year, as people will be busy with an actual harvest.</p>
