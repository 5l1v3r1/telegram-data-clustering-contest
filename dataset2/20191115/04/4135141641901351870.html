      <p><b>NEWARK, N.J. (AP)</b> — Freshman Malik Hall hit a layup with 26 seconds to play and scored all 17 of his points in the second half as No. 3 Michigan State overcame a late five-point deficit and beat No. 12 Seton Hall 76-73 Thursday night in a wildly exciting contest worthy of March Madness.</p>
      <p>Cassius Winston added two free throws with 3.4 seconds to play to push the lead to three points, and the Spartans (2-1) played tough defense on drives in the lane by Sandro Mamukelashvili and Myles Powell in the waning seconds. The Pirates eventually saw a desperation half-court heave by Powell bounce off the top of the rim as the final buzzer sounded.</p>
      <p>Winston scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half, playing his second game in less than a week after the death of his brother, Zachary.</p>
      <p>Powell was remarkable, scoring 37 points in a game most felt he would miss because of an ankle injury. Myles Cale added 12 for the Pirates (2-1) in the Gavitt Tipoff game at the Prudential Center.</p>
      <p>Trailing 66-62 after Winston hit a 3-pointer with 4:51 to play, Mamukelashvili hit a 3-pointer to ignite a 9-0 run that Powell ended with his fifth and sixth 3-pointers of the game to give Seton Hall a 71-66 lead with 2:41 to play.</p>
      <p>Rocket Watts closed the gap to two points with a line-drive 3-pointer from the right wing with 1:44 to go and Winston, who picked up two early fouls, briefly put the Spartans back in front 72-71 with a 3-pointer with 1:02 left.</p>
      <p>Powell, who played 34 minutes on what his coach described as a high ankle sprain he suffered last weekend, gave The Hall its last lead when he hit two free throws with 43 seconds to go.</p>
      <p>Hall’s layup put Michigan State ahead 74-73. Mamukelashvili drove the lane and missed a shot on which the officials ignored contact. After Winston missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 14 seconds to go, Powell drove the lane, drew contact and didn’t get a call.</p>
      <p>The game drew a crowd of 14,051, and the fans witnessed a contest with 14 lead changes, nine ties and neither team leading by more than seven points.</p>
      <p>Hall, who didn’t score in the Spartans’ first two games, made all seven of his shots, including three 3-pointers. His only missed shots were two free throws with 3:39 to play.</p>
      <p>For a game in early November, this had the feeling of a late-season showdown between rivals vying for a spot in the NCAA Tournament or even a tournament game. The crowd was electric from the moment Powell was introduced as a starter to every outstanding shot, block and lead change.</p>
      <p>It was tough and physical, with officials for the most part letting them play, and the game was compelling from start to finish.</p>
