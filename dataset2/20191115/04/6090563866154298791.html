      <p>CBZ bank has revealed that the  controversial $42 000 bond coin bucket money was drawn by a gambling house which then used the money to pay a punter who had struck it rich while betting.</p>
      <p>The bank further alleges that the image which went viral on social media was that of the punter celebrating his good fortune with his payout.  This comes after the RBZ threatened to take action against banks diverting money to the black market.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on social media CBZ said the withdrawal fulfilled regulatory requirements:</p>
      <blockquote>STATEMENT ON PICTURES OF BIN CONTAINER WITH BOND COINS CIRCULATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA<br/><br/>In response to social media publications circulating, we would like to advise members of the public that CBZ Bank Limited conducted internal investigations regarding the issue raised.<br/><br/>The results confirm that a withdrawal of $1 and $0.25 bond coins took place at one of our Branches.
