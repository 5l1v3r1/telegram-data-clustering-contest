      <p><b>Renault</b> has decided to stop selling the warmed-up <b>Megane GT and GT-Line</b> in Australia, leaving the 205kW <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/megane/news/"><b>RS</b></a> hot hatch as the sole member of its small-car range.</p>
      <p>While there’s no impediment to sourcing Megane GT and GT-Lines, the company says customer demand has declined to the point the cost of stocking them, promoting them, keeping parts for them, and transporting them, no longer stacks up.</p>
      <p>Once existing stock is depleted, no more will be ordered.</p>

      <p>The Megane GT <b>($38,990 before on-roads)</b> undercuts the entry-level RS by $7000, and had a less powerful <b>151kW 1.6-litre turbo engine.</b></p>
      <p>But its rear-wheel steering and sporty looks made it a warmed-up alternative to the full-on RS. The <b>$32,990 GT-Line</b> kept the looks but had a less powerful <b>1.2-litre</b> drivetrain.</p>
      <p>There was a time where Renault offered its <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/megane/news/">Megane</a> in multiple specification levels below even GT-Line, in hatchback, wagon and sedan bodies. But with small-car sales battling, it has progressively reduced this range.</p>
      <p>“The response of the market and demand from customers was just not there to try to make it work at a national level,” Renault Australia managing director Anouk Poelmann told us.</p>

      <p>“And it’s in response to how the market is changing. The the SUV market is still growing, passenger market is going down, and we were too small to play a significant role,” she added.</p>
      <p>Reflecting this, the company now offers the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/kadjar/">Kadjar</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/koleos/">Koleos SUVs</a>, which it says better serve the majority of its buyers. It will also launch new-generation <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/clio/">Clio</a> hatch and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/captur/">Captur</a> crossover models next year, alongside the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/zoe/">Zoe EV</a>.</p>
      <p>From here, you can expect the Megane badge to become more synonymous with performance, augmented by hotter RS derivatives such as <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/801442/renault-megane-rs-trophy-r-price-announced-record-edition/">the Trophy-R</a>. Anyone keen on a non-RS Megane will be steered towards a Kadjar or Koleos.</p>
