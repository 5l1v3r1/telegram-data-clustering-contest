      <h1>Consumer Spending Fell For First Time In 4 Decades In 2017-18: Business Standard Report</h1>
      <h2>The report on the NSO survey was approved for release on June 19, 2019 but withheld due to “adverse” findings, Somesh Jha found.</h2>

      <p>The government on Friday said it would not release the National Statistical Office survey on consumer spending in 2017-18 after <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/consumer-spend-sees-first-fall-in-4-decades-on-weak-rural-demand-nso-data-119111401975_1.html"><i>Business Standard</i></a> published an exclusive report by Somesh Jha which said that spending had fallen for the first time in over four decades.</p>
      <p>“In view of the data quality issues, the Ministry has decided not to release the Consumer Expenditure Survey results of 2017-2018. The Ministry is separately examining the feasibility of conducting the next Consumer Expenditure Survey in 2020-2021 and 2021-22 after incorporating all data quality refinements in the survey process,” the Ministry of Statistics &amp; Programme Implementation’s statement said, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2017-18-consumer-spending-survey-wont-be-released-over-data-quality-issues-says-government-next-repo-2133234?pfrom=home-topscroll"><i>NDTV</i></a> quoted.</p>

      <p>The report on the NSO survey was approved for release on June 19, 2019 but withheld due to “adverse” findings, Jha had found. The government has <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/2017-18-consumer-spending-survey-wont-be-released-over-data-quality-issues-says-government-next-repo-2133234?pfrom=home-topscroll">denied</a> this.</p>
      <p>Sources told Jha the government has appointed a committee to look into the data and had been told there was no defect in the report.</p>
      <p>The survey was held a little after demonetisation and during the period in which GST was implemented.</p>
      <p>It found that consumer spending fell by 8.8% in villages in 2017-18. </p>
      <aside>Experts said a dip in consumption expenditure indicated an increasing prevalence of poverty in the country. The data set also corroborates a shortage of demand in the economy, driven by the rural market.<cite>Somesh Jha, Business Standard</cite></aside>
      <p>Consumer spending rose in cities by 2% over six years, the report said.</p>
      <p>Experts told Jha the most worrying trend in the NSO report was the decline in food consumption, which implied increased malnutrition.</p>

      <p>Previously, the government had withheld the release of the NSO report on India’s unemployment rate. Jha published a scoop <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/jobs-crisis-unemployment-nsso-survey-narendra-modi-bjp-rep_in_5c529329e4b04f8645c7918c">in January</a> based on numbers from the report which showed that the unemployment rate stood at a whopping 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18.</p>
      <p>Two non-government members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) had <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/national-statistical-commission-members-quit-after-govt-refuses-to-release-jobs-report-nsso-employment_in_5c50682fe4b0f43e410b267f?utm_hp_ref=in-homepage">resigned</a>, partly because of the government’s refusal to release the report, which the body had approved in December.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/indias-jobless-rate-economic-slowdown_in_5dbbcfe7e4b0249f4822112c?utm_hp_ref=in-business">Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s data</a> showed India’s unemployment rate in October rose to 8.5%, the highest since August 2016, and up from 7.2% in September, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in the economy.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Moody’s <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/business/moodys-india-rating-news-moodys-cuts-indias-gdp-growth-forecast-to-5-6-for-2019-20-2132348">revised its forecast</a> for India’s GDP growth down to 5.6%. This is was the third straight downward revision by the credit rating agency.</p>
      <p>“India’s economic growth has decelerated since mid-2018, with real GDP growth slipping from nearly 8 per cent to 5 per cent in the second quarter of 2019 and joblessness rising,” it said.</p>
      <p>Economist Arun Kumar, widely considered to be an authority on black money in India, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/indian-economy-recession-demonetisation-black-money_in_5dc53e34e4b00927b231296c?utm_hp_ref=in-business">told HuffPost India’s Akshay Deshmane</a> that Indian economy has entered a full-blown recession.</p>
      <p>India’s Former Chief Statistician Dr Pronab Sen had said in September the “principal source” of India’s current <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/india-gdp-drops-to-5-percent-in-april-june-quarter_in_5d691293e4b0488c0d133d6e">economic slowdown</a> was the “liquidity crunch” that resulted from <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/demonetisation/">demonetisation</a> in 2016.</p>
