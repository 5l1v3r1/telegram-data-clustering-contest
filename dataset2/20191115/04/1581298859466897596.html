      <h1>Esperance Shire set to apply for federal CCTV funding</h1>

      <p>Preventing burglaries and stopping teens from throwing rocks at cars could be some of the benefits from a new CCTV network.</p>
      <p>The Shire of Esperance is working to apply for the federal Safer Communities Fund Round 5, with the deadline for applications on December 10.</p>
      <p>There are currently only four cameras in the CBD and they are more than 10 years old.</p>
      <p>A fully-funded network would cover from McDonalds down to the Museum Village and have far better clarity.</p>
      <p>Police highlighted the Harbour Road overpass as another ideal place due to an ongoing issue with juveniles throwing rocks at cars.</p>
      <p>The foreshore was another spot identified due to the high number of community assets.</p>
      <p>The shire is also considering the possibility of a live feed at the skate park, especially for parents' peace of mind.</p>
      <p>Police also said the carparks at West Beach and Twilight Beach would be good locations for CCTV because thieves knew people left valuables in their cars at the beach.</p>
      <p>Other locations include Pink Lake Road, covering Sinclair and Nulsen and the Castletown shopping precinct.</p>
      <p>Shire president Ian Mickel and Cr Jennifer Obourne met with police last week to discuss the issue. Cr Obourne said there was broad support from her fellow councillors for more CCTV.</p>
      <p>She said better CCTV would boost community confidence and Esperance's reputation as a secure destination among tourists.</p>
      <p>The fund allows local governments to apply for up to $1 million.</p>
      <p>Cr Obourne said the shire was currently looking at putting in an application for at least $120,000.</p>
      <p>The shire last applied for CCTV funding in 2017 and was unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>Esperance Police Senior Sergeant Justin Tarasinski said police had expressed their full support.</p>
      <p>Snr Sergeant Tarasinski said CCTV helped prevent certain crimes and was a helpful investigative tool.</p>
      <p>"If we've got offenders out there and we can identify them on CCTV and charge them as quickly as possible after the fact, then that prevents them from continuing to put the community at risk," he said.</p>
      <p>"As CCTV is more readily rolled out across the state, you're going to be up against less opposition each time. At some stage it's going to be our turn."</p>
      <p>The CCTV would be the shire's asset, but police would likely monitor it and have 24/7 access.</p>
