      <h1>“Suck My Ass”: Watch Lizzo, Green Day And Billie Eilish Respond To Mean Tweets</h1>

      <p>Jimmy Kimmel’s ‘Mean Tweets’ segment has been kicking around for a few years now, and it still never fails to turn up some comedy gold.</p>
      <p>The premise is, uh, fairly straightforward: celebrities come on and read viciously funny and mean tweets about themselves, and try and throw some shit back in their defence. Simple, effective, and very, very funny.</p>

      <p>The latest edition features an A-list music cast, including Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Chance the Rapper, Green Day, Alice Cooper, John Mayer, and more. The tweets are on point: “Billie Eilish dresses like she got her clothes stolen at the gym so they gave her what they had in the lost and found bin,” Eilish reads out, before dropping a paint-stripping eye roll.</p>
      <p>Alice Cooper doesn’t escape either, as he reads out a genuinely pertinent question: “Alice Cooper looked 65 in 1972 how is he still alive?”. Cardi B didn’t have a bar of her mean tweet, simply replying “suck my ass”.</p>
      <p>Lizzo, of course, gives as good as she got. “Lizzo. Bus passes and happy meals. Two things I imagine Lizzo seen a lot of,” the tweet read, which was no match for her. “Yeah I’m a big bitch and I ride a bus,” she retorted. “A tour bus, motherfucker.”</p>
      <p>Watch the full video below. It won’t be long until we get to see Lizzo in the flesh — she’s out here <a href="https://junkee.com/fomo-2020-lineup/211553">headlining FOMO Festival</a> in January, and she’ just announced two headlining shows in Sydney and Melbourne, get <a href="https://cuziloveyou.lizzomusic.com/">all the dates and details here</a>.</p>
