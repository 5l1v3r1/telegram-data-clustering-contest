      <p>A couple had to cancel their wedding and honeymoon after their home was flooded.</p>
      <p>Claire Ulyett, 40, and Lorna Ulyett, 39, from Bentley in Doncaster, were due to get married this Spring.</p>
      <p>But they had to forget their dream day after being hit by the floods.</p>
      <p>Water destroyed their ground floor after it came seeping through the air bricks before they received sandbags.</p>
      <p>Despite their own ordeal the couple have been concentrating on helping local residents and the elderly since the floods arrived.</p>
      <p>“I've lived here 18 years and was flooded in 2007. We have only been insured for six months,” Claire said.</p>
      <p>She said before that quotes for insurance with flood cover were “way out of my budget”.</p>

      <p>One claim after the first floods she said was an extraordinary £10,000 but mostly she was quoted between £2,000 and £3,000.</p>
      <p>“At the moment we are living upstairs because the insurance company say it's habitable. They won't take action until the danger has passed.</p>
      <p>“It's stopped our marriage, we'd paid the deposit for a lodge in Derbyshire for the honeymoon but for now but there are people worse off than us.”</p>

      <p>Her partner Lorna, who has damaged her back carrying sandbags around for her neighbours, added: “The response to this has been a joke.</p>
      <p>“It was only after the homes were flooded that we got sandbags.</p>
      <p>“If it hadn't been for the local community people could have died. The manholes were up.</p>
      <p>“We were taking sandbags round in trollies and in wheelie bins. It was the local people who got the elderly out."</p>
