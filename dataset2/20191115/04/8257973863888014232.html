      <h1>Atlanta Braves sign veteran reliever Will Smith to three-year deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:07:36+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:07</time> by <a rel="author">Connor Grott</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 14 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Atlanta-Braves/?tps=1">Atlanta Braves</a> boosted their bullpen, signing former <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/San-Francisco-Giants/?tps=1">San Francisco Giants</a> reliever <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Will_Smith/?tps=1">Will Smith</a> to a multiyear contract.</p>
      <p>The Braves <a href="https://twitter.com/Braves/status/1195094324444323842">announced</a> Thursday that Smith signed a three-year, $39 million deal with the team. The agreement also includes a 2023 club option for an additional $13 million.</p>
      <p>League sources told <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffPassan/status/1195095237804331009">ESPN</a> the contract includes a buyout that will pay Smith $1 million if the Braves decide to not pick up the club option.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank the Giants for giving me the opportunity that they did back in 2016," Smith said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B43pgKElzLZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">in a statement</a>. "It was my first taste of the playoffs I've had in my career and it is something I'll never forget. The Giants are a first class organization hands down and welcomed me and my family with the utmost respect.</p>
      <p>"Without their training staff, coming back from [Tommy John] surgery would not have been possible and for that I am forever thankful. ... Thank you for all the good times. And to the fans, thank you for the constant support and loyalty."</p>
      <p>Smith, 30, recorded 34 saves in 38 opportunities for the Giants this past season. He had a 6-0 record with a 2.76 ERA. The Georgia native struck out 96 while walking 21 and was named to the All-Star team for the first time in his MLB career.</p>
      <p>Smith previously received a $17.8 million qualifying offer from the Giants. He signed with the Braves shortly before the deadline to accept that offer. Atlanta will forfeit its second-highest pick in the 2020 draft for signing the veteran closer.</p>
