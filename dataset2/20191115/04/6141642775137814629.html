      <p>Troy Parrott is keeping his fingers crossed that he did enough on his Republic of Ireland debut to be involved in Monday night’s Euro 2020 showdown with Denmark.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old Tottenham striker was thrust in at the deep end in Thursday evening’s 3-1 friendly victory over New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium and although he did not cap his big night with a goal, he provided a key assist.</p>
      <p>Manager Mick McCarthy must now decide if he, or any of his other under-studies, has a role to play when the Danes arrive in Dublin after giving them a chance against the All Whites, and Parrott insists he would relish the opportunity.</p>
      <p>He said: “Of course, yeah, that’s the dream for everyone. Obviously it’s a massive game, and we’ve taken tonight’s positive result going into Monday’s big game.</p>
      <blockquote>I've made my debut for Tottenham and I’ve come in here and made my debut for Ireland<cite>Troy Parrott</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“I was just delighted to get out there. Walking out in the green jersey in my home town of Dublin is the best feeling I’ve ever felt.</p>
      <p>“I felt I did well. I had a couple of chances – I could have maybe taken them, but I felt I did well.”</p>
      <p>Parrott, who made his first senior appearance for Spurs in a Carabao Cup tie against Colchester in September, was given his opportunity after scoring three times in as many appearances for Ireland’s Under-21s.</p>
      <p>But it was as provider that he made his mark for McCarthy’s side, teeing up Sean Maguire to score his first goal for the Republic after Derrick Williams had broken his duck to cancel out debutant Callum McCowatt’s opener for the Kiwis.</p>
      <blockquote>I’m just going to try to keep on doing what I can do, working hard and trying to learn from people, and hopefully I can go far in the game</blockquote>
      <p>Parrott said: “As I said in an interview during the week, it’s about scoring goals and getting assists and creating chances.</p>
      <p>“Unluckily enough, I didn’t get the goal tonight, but I’m happy I came away from the game with an assist.”</p>
      <p>Substitute Callum Robinson rounded off the win with his first senior international goal after replacing Parrott, but the youngster departed having taken another significant stride in his fledgling career.</p>
      <p>He said: “Of course I have been satisfied with the strides I’ve been making as I’ve made my debut for Tottenham and I’ve come in here and made my debut for Ireland.</p>
      <p>“But I’m just going to try to keep on doing what I can do, working hard and trying to learn from people, and hopefully I can go far in the game.”</p>
