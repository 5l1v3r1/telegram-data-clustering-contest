      <h3>Graham Cornes has floated the possibility of selling naming rights at Adelaide Oval in a bid to cut food and drink prices and lift attendances at the ground.</h3>
      <blockquote>Writing for The Advertiser, Cornesy says:<br/><br/>Perhaps it’s time to sell the naming rights for Adelaide Oval. I could never accept it when Footy Park was named after a sponsor but times have slowly changed and now most great stadiums have sold out to naming sponsors.<br/><br/>Besides, there has to be other ways of increasing profit than by raising prices. And rising prices is one main reason why the fans will stay home…<br/><br/>It’s simply too expensive these days and with new technology and giant television screens, cheap food and drink, it’s tempting to stay home.<br/><br/>Attendances are falling steadily at Adelaide Oval. Something drastic has to be done to reverse the trend. Making it cheaper for a family to buy a pie, a bucket of chips and a Coke for the kids and a beer for Dad can only make it more appealing. If that means reaping a windfall by selling the naming rights of the Oval, so be it.</blockquote>
