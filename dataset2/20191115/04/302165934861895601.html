      <p>LONDON, Nov 15 — Seventy years after the original J-type van launched in the 1950s, Morris Commercial has brought the iconic model back; on Wednesday, the company took the wraps off the Morris JE after first teasing it back in October.</p>
      <p>This week Morris Commercial officially announced the return of the J-type van from the ‘50s after recently having resurrected the Morris name — and this time around, it’s electric.</p>
      <p>The British company first began teasing the model in October, and on Wednesday, the company unveiled its vibrant paint job and updated powertrain.</p>
      <p>The silhouette and overall design stay true to the original model including the “pear-shaped” grille (which houses the vehicle’s charging port), curved roof, and rounded body which have been intended to inspire “feelings of joy and nostalgia”.</p>

      <p>The interior has a retro flair to match the outside including body-coloured components and an old-school-styled steering wheel. Seats covered in leather give the model a luxe feeling.</p>
      <p>With its carbon fibre body and modular chassis, the Morris JE is a lightweight alternative to conventional gas-powered commercial vehicles. Its integrated connected technology, too, sets the model apart from the competition. A high-resolution infotainment system offers users navigation tools and a parking camera feed among other functions. The range on a single charge measures in at about 200 miles.</p>
      <p>The van offers 5.5 metres cubed of load space and can transport up to a 1,000kg payload — specs that turn the model into what the company calls, “a ‘big’ little van”.</p>
      <p>Morris Commercial has plans to update the JE with autonomous driving technologies in the future but did not offer a timeline.</p>
      <p>The model is expected to go on sale 2021 for over US$75,000 (RM311,287). Interested clients can customise and pre-order one today. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
