      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 15): The FBM KLCI stayed lacklustre and was rooted below the 1,600-point level as domestic sentiment remained fragile.</p>
      <p>Investor sentiment was further dampened as Malaysia's GDP in the third quarter of 2019 slowed to 4.4% year-on-year, after posting a 4.9% growth in the second quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>At 12.30pm, the FBM KLCI was up 0.35 points to 1,593.9.</p>
      <p>Losers led gainers by 308 to 268, while 518 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 1.55 billion shares valued at RM756.41 million.</p>
      <p>The gainers included PPB Group Bhd, Heineken Malaysia Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Batu Kawan Bhd, Lysaght Galvanized Steel Bhd, Pasdec Holdings Bhd and United Malacca Bhd.</p>
      <p>The actives included Sapura Energy Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Priceworth International Bhd, DGB Asia Bhd, i-Stone Group Bhd, IFCA MSC Bhd and Velesto Energy Bhd.</p>
      <p>The decliners included Petronas Dagangan Bhd, Fraser &amp; Neave Holdings Bhd, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, LPI Capital Bhd, Nestle (M) Bhd and Westports Holdings Bhd.</p>
      <p>Asian stocks jumped on Friday, propelled by a record S&amp;P 500 finish and White House comments suggesting Washington and Beijing were close to striking a trade deal, reviving hopes the tariff war may near an end, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>However, analysts said investor sentiment remained fragile after weak data from China reinforced concerns about the global economy and amid increasing caution about false signs of progress in Sino-US trade talks, it said.</p>
      <p>Affin Hwang Capital Research said the FBM KLCI Index fell in yesterday's session, dropping 3.67 points or 0.23%, closing at 1,593.55.</p>
      <p>It said the index continued to retrace in yesterday's trading session, indicating potential fresh selling coming into play.</p>
      <p>"Looking at technical indicators on the daily chart: 1) MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is steadily converging towards the Signal line, 2) RSI (relative strength index) &amp; Stochastic exiting overbought territories, now showing signs of pointing downwards.</p>
      <p>"All of these points towards a downward reversal signal as upside is perceived to be limited," it said.</p>
