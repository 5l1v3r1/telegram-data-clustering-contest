      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. — <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/jordan-greenway-player-stats">Jordan Greenway</a> deflected in a goal with 7:49 remaining, and the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/minnesota-wild-team">Minnesota Wild</a> returned home with a 3-2 win over the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/arizona-coyotes-team">Arizona Coyotes</a> on Thursday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/zach-parise-player-stats">Zach Parise</a> had a goal and an assist and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/kevin-fiala-player-stats">Kevin Fiala</a> scored for the fourth time in six games for Minnesota, which had just finished a four-game West Coast Swing. The Wild were tied for an NHL-low 13 points entering the day amid a road-heavy early schedule. They are 4-1-1 at home.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/devan-dubnyk-player-stats">Devan Dubnyk</a> made 27 saves for Minnesota.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/conor-garland-player-stats">Conor Garland</a> and <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/lawson-crouse-player-stats">Lawson Crouse</a> scored for Arizona, which came back twice to the tie the game. <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/antti-raanta-player-stats">Antti Raanta</a> stopped 31 shots.</p>
      <p>The Wild recovered from a pair of two-goal deficits to win in Arizona last week. They didn’t let the Coyotes complete any comeback Thursday.</p>
      <p>Fiala opened the scoring in the first period, flipping a rebound backhand over Raanta.</p>
      <p>Garland, with his ninth goal in 20 games this season, took advantage of a mistake by Dubnyk in the second. Dubnyk played the puck behind his net, sending it out to the left where <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/nick-schmaltz-player-stats">Nick Schmaltz</a> intercepted the clearing attempt and quickly centered to Garland. He redirected the pass before Dubnyk could recover.</p>
      <p>Parise scored on the power play 5:39 into the third, but the Coyotes quickly answered as Crouse scored less than two minutes later.</p>
