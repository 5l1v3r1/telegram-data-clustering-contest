      <h1>Kodak Black Is Crying Foul On Prison Officials!</h1>

      <p>He's basically saying he does not grab ball sacs when he fights.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors)</b> I don't know about you, but I thought it was weird that Kodak Black would go so low as to grab someone in the <b>cojones during a fight! </b>This is exactly what prison officials said happened with the rapper. They say that they were attempting to breaking up a fight and he went low and grabbed the SAC of a guard. He f#cked that guard up too! “His abdomen and intestinal wall were breached," according to reports.</p>
      <p>Well, guess what? I'm hearing Kodak is saying <i>they</i> must have drugged him because the reports say he was <i>HIGH</i>. He simply maintains that they did it, but under the influence. I am not sure how that would happen, but maybe it did. The only thing that does not really seem to make sense is that this fight stuff all happened weeks ago, way before he was sentenced. I guess they would not need to fight it until it was part of the reason why he got those 46 years in the bing. I don't know, but TMZ is saying that he drank something that was laced with something that drove the rapper so BONKERS that he's grabbing BOZAKS!  If you know the world, bozak...say something in the comments! </p>
      <p>Kodak Black’s team publically isn't saying who drugged him at all, but they CLEARLY cannot say it was an inmate or that would be snitching. So, they can infer that it was somebody that is not really regarded as "telling."</p>
      <p>By the way, it broke today that DAK got another three years while he is serving these nearly four years. Here is what it says on Fox News:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Rapper Kodak Black was sentenced Wednesday to more than three years in federal prison after pleading guilty to weapons charges stemming from his arrest just before a scheduled concert performance in May.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>The 22-year-old Black admitted in August that he falsified information on federal forms to buy four firearms from a Miami-area gun shop on two separate occasions.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Black was able to obtain three of the weapons: a 9 mm handgun, a .380-caliber handgun and a semi-automatic Mini Draco weapon. Authorities said one of the guns was found at the scene of a March shooting in Pompano Beach, although he has not been charged in that case.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I have not been able to determine if this will run concurrently or not. This is hardly the end for him. So all you guys saying "Free KODAK" may want to wait a bit. Here is the other stuff...he's looking at more years based on drug, weapons and sexual assault charges! He's got a serious legal situation on his hands! I just hope he gets the help he deserves! </p>
