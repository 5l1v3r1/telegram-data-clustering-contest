      <p>REUTERS: PayPal said on Thursday (Nov 14) it had stopped payment support to PornHub's models after it found the adult entertainment website made certain payments without the permission of the payment processor.</p>
      <p>"Following a review, we have discovered that PornHub has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission. We have taken action to stop these transactions from occurring," PayPal said in an email statement.</p>
