      <p>A pure blast of nostalgia, The Toys That Made Us takes behind the curtain and gives us the inside scoop on the creation of our favourite toys of the '80s and '90s. Season 3 may very well end up being the best season yet, with four new episodes exploring the stories and creative battles behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, My Little Pony and wrestling figures. And, if that's not enough for you, the makers of The Toys That Made Us have a spin-off series debuting on Netflix later this month – The Movies That Made Us. Check out the trailer for The Toys That Made Us: Season 3 below.</p>

      <p>Following two stellar seasons with Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, The Crown jumps forward to the swinging sixties for its third season, with Olivia Colman (fresh from her Oscar-winning turn as an earlier Queen in The Favourite) taking over royal duties as an older, wiser Elizabeth. In season 3, The Crown explores England's economic downturn and fierce nationalism, as the royals face scrutiny from a public which sees them as aristocratic freeloaders.</p>

      <p>Klaus is Netflix Original Christmas film which tells the origin of Santa Claus using beautiful and neglected art form of traditional 2D animation – making it something of a Christmas miracle in of itself in this age of CGI. A delightfully oddball film that's received a surprisingly warm reception from critics. Featuring the voice acting talents of Jason Schwartzman, J.K. Simmons, Rashida Jones and Will Sasso, Klaus has all the hallmarks of becoming a new Christmas favourite.</p>
