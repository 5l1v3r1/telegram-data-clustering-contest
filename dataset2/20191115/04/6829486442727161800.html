      <h1>The Internet Is Already Obsessed With The Deeply Chaotic ‘Hot Ones’ Kristen Stewart Interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T04:02:23+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 04:02</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Kristen Stewart is having a moment.</p>
      <p>The one-time <i>Twilight</i> star has spent the last six or seven years choosing only roles that allow her to burn the entire project down. She is in auteur in her own right, a little shimmer of chaos that can make any line feel unusual, and strange, and alien. She never behaves like a real human being. That’s what makes her perfect.</p>
      <p>Hell, she’s even imagined to impress critics in <a href="https://junkee.com/charlies-angels-reviews/229430">the somewhat well-reviewed <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> film</a> — and that’s not exactly a role that you’d expect to necessarily pop. In the hands of anyone else, it’d be a run-of-the-mill action role. In the hands of Kristen Stewart, is a load of delicious staccato nonsense.</p>
      <p>To promote that film, Stewart appeared this week as a guest on <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/hot-ones"><i>Hot Ones</i></a>, the wildly popular internet talk show that sees celebrity guests eat a line of increasingly spicy wings.</p>
      <p>To say that she handled the wings well is to understate things. Barely breaking a sweat, Stewart nimbly hopped through questions, reflected on her many outfits, and contended with the great weight of celebrity.</p>
      <p>Oh, and she did it all while being deeply, deeply chaotic. Because that is the Kristen Stewart way.</p>
      <p>Like, I’m talking ‘eating wings with a knife and fork’ level chaotic. Bear witness to it here:</p>

      <p>Predictably, ever since the interview has dropped, the internet has taken on Stewart’s appearance on the show as a symbol of her deep relatability. After all, we’ve all had a raucous emotional trip, like Stewart…</p>

      <p>…we’ve all nervously shimmied in anticipation…</p>

      <p>…and we’ve all made fun of our good friend Shia LaBoef for his <i>Hot Ones</i> appearance.</p>

      <p>Okay, maybe not the last one. But the rest still stands: Stewart is the OG relatable chaos queen, and we thank her for every moment of joy that she adds to our lives.</p>
