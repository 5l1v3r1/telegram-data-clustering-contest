      <p>Fingerprint authentication for a financial transaction is quite secure but when there is a flaw, its most vulnerable. Recently, users of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series understood the dangers of a fingerprint sensor flaw. Since the problem was detected, Samsung has released a couple of updates. Yesterday, there were reports that Alipay fingerprint payment is now active for the Galaxy S10 series. Now, it is functioning normally for WeChat.</p>

      <h3>What happened t0 Samsung Galaxy S10/Note 10?</h3>
      <p>If you remember, some weeks ago, users said their Samsung Galaxy S10 and Note 10 handsets have a fingerprint identification issue. Particularly, the ‘Sun’ reported that after a British couple installed a third-party silicone shell on their devices, anyone’s fingerprint could unlock their phones. This is a huge security breach, especially for financial transactions. That time, Samsung immediately responded to this and advised users to desist from non-Samsung glass screen protectors while it works on an update to solve the issue.</p>
      <p>A week ago, Samsung launched an urgent update to fix the bug. The <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/24/samsung-fixes-fingerprint-vulnerability-of-galaxy-s10-and-note-10-via-update/">update</a> was pushed to the Galaxy S10 series and Note10 series phones. Yesterday, some users sent out screenshots showing the Galaxy S10/Note10 series has resumed Alipay fingerprint payment function. Now, we also have screenshots that WeChat fingerprint payment is active.</p>
      <h3>Financial institution actions with regards to the Samsung Galaxy S10 vulnerability</h3>
      <p>However, banks across the globe are not <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/22/banks-disable-app-fingerprint-login-option-for-samsung-galaxy-s10/">taking any chances</a>. Some financial institutions in China, Israel, and the UK have taken significant measures. The British bank, NatWest, and the Chinese bank (Bank of China), completely disabled their apps from Samsung Galaxy S10 users until Samsung solves the security problem. At the moment, there is still no information on whether the access has been resumed. In addition, another British financial institution, Nationwide Building Society, has a more gentle approach, and they decided to remove the option to fingerprint login from the app. Furthermore, Israeli netizens said that their bank also removed the option to fingerprint login from the app.</p>
