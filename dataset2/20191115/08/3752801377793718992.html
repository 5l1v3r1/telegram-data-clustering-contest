      <p>The court heard how the accused threatened the child not to tell anyone about what had happened and gave her R30 to keep it a secret. The following morning, the victim reported the incident to her mother who then alerted the police and the accused was arrested.</p>
      <p>The provincial commissioner of the South African Police Service in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma, has welcomed the hefty sentence.</p>
      <p>"General Zuma is pleased with the collective work done by the investigating team, the National Prosecution Authority, the judiciary as well as forensics which led to the conviction.</p>
      <p>"He further said that criminals who commit such violent crimes cannot be left roaming around the streets freely while innocent women and children live in fear," said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi.</p>
