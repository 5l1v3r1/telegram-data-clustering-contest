        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 15 – Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud appears to be headed for the Stamford Bridge exit in January, with Inter Milan tipped to make a move for the France international.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blues forward came to the rescue for France on Thursday night as he bagged a 79th-minute winner from the penalty spot to help Les Bleus edge past Moldova 2-1 in Paris.</p>
      <p>Back at Chelsea, Giroud is thought to have become frustrated by the lack of opportunities under manager Frank Lampard this season.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal star, who signed a one-year contract extension over the summer after the club utilised a clause in his previous deal, has only made two starts this season and the 33-year-old has spoken of the frustration of spending much of the campaign so far sat on the bench.</p>
      <p>There has been plenty of recent speculation regarding the forward’s future and now Inter Milan are thought to have joined the hunt to land the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Inter bolstered their attacking ranks over the summer with the arrival of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez from Manchester United.</p>
      <p>However, manager Antonio Conte is eager to add to his strike force and is thought to have identified Giroud as a target, having worked with the forward during his time at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>With less than six months left on his current deal, Giroud could be a bargain deal, with reports suggesting £6m might be enough to land the player.</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s inability to bring in a replacement due to their current transfer ban could be the only snagging point in any potential switch to the Serie A giants for World Cup-winner Giroud.</p>
