      <p>NAGPUR: Kidambi Srikanth kept the Indian challenge alive by reaching the semifinals of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hong-Kong-Open">Hong Kong Open</a> BWF World Tour Super 500 badminton tournament on Friday.</p>
      <p>Unseeded Srikanth shocked fifth seed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chen-Long">Chen Long</a> in the men’s singles quarterfinal to register only his second victory in eight encounters against the tall Chinese. Long, who won the gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, retired citing injury after losing the first game quite easily at 21-13.</p>
      <p>Srikanth, ranked No. 13, raced to win in just 15 minutes in the opening game. Struggling with his movement, Long pulled out of the match.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Srikanth will now take on local player Lee Cheuk Yiu in the semifinals on Saturday. Lee, 23, thumped former world champion Viktor Axelsen of Denmark 21-14, 21-19 in 38 minutes to seal a last-four berth.</p>
      <p>Former world No. 1 Srikanth has beaten world No. 27 Lee of Hong Kong 21-17, 21-18 during the India Open in New Delhi last year in the only match they have played so far on the circuit.</p>
      <p>Pullela Gopichand was pleased with Srikanth’s progress to reach the semi-final. "It is a good victory. This win will certainly boost his confidence a great deal. Reaching the semifinal in one of the major tournaments will help him regain his lost confidence. He was playing well but we were all waiting for this one big result," Gopichand told TOI on Friday.</p>
      <p>The chief national coach is hoping Srikanth continues his brilliant run. "Today's win will act as a tonic for him. The way Srikanth is playing I am just hoping that he goes on to play the final on Sunday. Every win is important for him because of the tough 2020 Olympics qualification process. He has slipped in the rankings and is eager to regain his top position," said Gopichand.</p>
      <p>"I am really impressed with today's scores. Chen Long is injured and not fully fit but having said that, credit cannot be taken away from Srikanth's efforts. Players these days are under severe pressure to keep their world rankings and playing continuously without a break. It is tough for every player out there," said Gopichand, who has been guiding Srikanth for nearly a decade.</p>
