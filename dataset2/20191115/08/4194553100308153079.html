      <h1>Steve Nicol tells Jadon Sancho to join LFC; says he’d be “crazy” to join Man Utd</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:11:33+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/steven-carson/" target="_blank">Ste Carson</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool legend Steve Nicol has urged England star Jadon Sancho to join his former club, and snub any interest from fierce rivals Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are also said to be interested in the Borussia Dortmund flyer, but it remains to be seen who would stand the best chance of tempting the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>Sancho hasn’t hit the ground running, as he did in the Bundesliga last season, and Nicol believes that joining another struggle at United would not be wise.</p>
      <p>“<b>I think he’s crazy if he goes to Man United,</b>” the Scot told ESPN FC (<a href="https://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/sancho-would-be-crazy-to-join-man-utd-former-liverpool-star/1gobf8fcdol4c15555a56aebq3">via GOAL</a>).</p>
      <p>“<b>We’re talking about he’s struggling in a team that’s struggling [Dortmund] – Man United are going to be struggling for a couple of seasons, so I would stay away from there.</b>”</p>
      <p>The former defender has urged the former City winger to join Liverpool instead, but admits that it would be a hard sell to the player as he’d have to accept a lesser role than the likes of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>“<b>Well, if I was advising him, let me put it that way, I would like to see him at Liverpool.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>I think he would be fantastic. If he could get his head round playing second fiddle to Mane and Salah, then that would be huge for Liverpool in my opinion.</b></p>
      <p>“<b>They could save the legs of both of those two and kind of swap the three of them in and out, but he’s not going to do that, he’s going to go somewhere to play. So I think Liverpool’s out.</b>”</p>
      <p>I agree with Nicol – I’d love to see Sancho at Anfield, but I think he’s more likely to seek regular football away from Liverpool. I’m not even convinced he’ll be up for leaving Dortmund, if he isn’t homesick.</p>
