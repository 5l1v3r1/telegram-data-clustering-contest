      <h1>This Blockchain-Based Social Media Network Is The First Apple Pay Approved DApp</h1>

      <p>During day two of BlockShow Asia 2019, Pepo founder and CEO Jason Goldberg hosted a keynote to present his new product. With 15,000 users and more than 45,000 peer-to-peer transactions to its credit, Pepo aims to change the way people create content for the crypto community.</p>
      <p>“We are already among the biggest DApps in the world. We are now number 12, and we aim to reach the top really soon,” Goldberg said. “Pepo is the result of almost four years of research and listening to the crypto community.”</p>
      <p>The app is available for download on Apple and Android devices, and it behaves like a social media network with a built-in crypto wallet. People can use their cryptocurrencies to tip their favorite creators, as well as to buy things on its marketplace.</p>
      <p>“We are the first DApp approved by Apple Pay, so people can buy our tokens using this payment method among others, of course,” he said.</p>
      <p>Pepo lets its users upload short videos, and their followers to pay them tips using the built-in wallet. The tokens are used to tip the creators you choose, but also can be spent on the marketplace, which sort of allows its users to buy Amazon, Apple and stores gift cards using crypto.</p>
      <p>“You can earn much more than likes, but real appreciation,” Goldberg said.</p>
