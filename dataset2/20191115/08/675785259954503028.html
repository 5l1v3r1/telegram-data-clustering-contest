      <h1>Timo Werner 'must accept Jurgen Klopp term' to agree Liverpool transfer</h1>
      <h2>The Premier League club are reportedly interested in a move for the RB Leipzig striker</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:56:16+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Timo Werner would have to accept a back-up role at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in order to complete a move to Anfield, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Although the Reds have made a stunning start to the season and currently hold an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League, Jurgen Klopp is understood to be looking to strengthen his side when the transfer window re-opens in January.</p>
      <p>And the German has reportedly put RB Leipzig star Werner at the top his list as he looks to guide the Merseyside club to their first league title since 1990.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have long been linked with a move for the striker, but Bleacher Report claims that the 23-year-old would have to agree to a place on the bench in to secure a switch to the European champions.</p>

      <p>Despite already scoring an impressive 15 goals in all competitions for Leipzig this season, the Germany international would face a tough task to force his way into a dominant front three.</p>
      <p>Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have been on top form in the early stages of the season and played a crucial role in the Reds' unbeaten start to the league campaign.</p>
      <p>Werner's record of 61 goals in just 104 Bundesliga games for Leipzig has seen him establish himself as one of the top talents in Europe, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and Bayern Munich also believed to be showing interest in the former Stuttgart man.</p>

      <p>He is currently under contract until 2023, but current boss Julian Nagelsmann has claimed that he would not stop his star forward from leaving if the right opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>"I’ve already advised many players to take off their wedding ring with their current club to move somewhere else," Nagelsmann said in an interview with <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/vereine/rb-leipzig/julian-nagelsmann-trainer-timo-wener-niklas-suele-wechsel-65994432.sport.html">Sport Bild</a> .</p>
      <p>"I’d do the same with Timo Werner if he were developing faster than the team at RB Leipzig."</p>
