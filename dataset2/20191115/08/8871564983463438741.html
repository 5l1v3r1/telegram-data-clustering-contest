      <h1>Four arrested in Jalan Duta Hermes bag heist, 81 purses recovered</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:57:08+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20KL" target="_blank">Coconuts KL</a></address>
      <p>Following an October residential robbery in which over RM6 million (US$1.5 million) worth of handbags alone were stolen, police have <a href="https://www.sinarharian.com.my/article/57256/BERITA/Jenayah/Geng-Raju-curi-beg-Hermes-RM6-juta-tumpas">announced that they have arrested four suspects and recovered some of the stolen items</a>.</p>
      <p>The four males, allegedly part of the so-called “Raju Gang,” are accused of robbing the upmarket Jalan Duta bungalow on Oct. 3, making off with 85 Hermes handbags, 10 gold rings, a diamond chain, and a Toyato Alphard passenger van.</p>
      <p>Eighty-one of the Birkin bags were recovered by officers after arrests were made yesterday across Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>One of the suspects in the case allegedly pretended to be a deliveryman during the Oct. 3 robbery, and once he gained access to the premises, four more men entered and tied up both the gardener and the security guard.</p>
      <p>Kuala Lumpur’s police chief, Mazlan Lazim, revealed that the men were between 24 and 47 years old. Two were detained in Segambut and Cheras in KL, and two more were found the in the surrounding states of Negri Sembilan and Selangor.</p>
      <p>Police are still searching for two more men believed to be involved in the robbery, S. Kajenthiran, 26, and K. Parameswaran, 24, who are thought to have fled along with three Hermes bags yet to be recovered. The other missing bag was reportedly sold in a neighboring country for RM15,000 (US$3,500) — a fraction of the retail price of a Birkin bag, which can cost anywhere from US$9,550 to US$300,000.</p>
      <p>Serious question to the universe, but are there any other countries out there that see <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/malaysias-luxury-loving-former-first-lady-rosmah-mansor-laments-trying-times/">Hermes bags in the headlines as much as we do in Malaysia</a>, because – honestly – it feels like it’s just us.</p>
