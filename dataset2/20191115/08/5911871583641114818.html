      <h1>Watch Thom Yorke Play A Lovely Solo-Piano “Daily Battles” On <i>Colbert</i></h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:57:37+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Breihan</a></address>
      <p>Back in August, Thom Yorke and Flea shared “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2055546/thom-yorke-flea-daily-battles-wynton-marsalis-motherless-brooklyn/music/">Daily Battles</a>” a beautiful slow-floating song that the two of them wrote for <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i>, Edward Norton’s ’50s-noir adaptation of the great Jonathan Lethem novel. <i>Motherless Brooklyn</i> has since theaters, and even though it got good reviews, it’s a confirmed mega-flop. But its Best Original Song Oscar hopes are alive! So maybe that’s why Yorke was on Stephen Colbert’s <i>Late Show</i> last night, performing “Daily Battles.”</p>
      <p>Yorke was <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2060077/watch-thom-yorke-talk-boris-johnson-dreams-the-possibility-that-hell-be-knighted-on-colbert/video/">on <i>Colbert</i></a> just last month, though he was there to talk, not to play music. And since his solo album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2048712/thom-yorke-anima-review/franchises/premature-evaluation/">ANIMA</a></i> came out earlier in the year, Yorke has been doing a bit more promo than usual; his <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061612/watch-thom-yorke-play-an-intense-trippy-three-song-set-on-kimmel/video/">extended <i>Kimmel</i> performance</a> last month was something to see. But what he did last night on <i>Colbert</i> was very different.</p>
      <p>Yorke only just <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063395/thom-yorke-daily-battles-live-debut-performance/video/">performed “Daily Battles” live</a> for the first time a few weeks ago. And on <i>Colbert</i>, he sat at center stage, singing the song and playing piano without outside accompaniment. (The recorded version of the song is still pretty spare, but it’s got a lot more going on than just voice and piano.) Yorke sang beautifully and really brought out the song’s luminous-lullaby side. And while Yorke can be a captivatingly fidgety performer, he is still able to hold audiences rapt even in his stillest moments. This performance was one of those. Watch it below.</p>
