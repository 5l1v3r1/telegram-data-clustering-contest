      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- Cape Coral Police deal with criminals, car accidents, and wildlife. But one gator call didn't go exactly as planned recently.</p>
      <p>They posted a video to social media Friday highlighting a lighter incident involving a small, but feisty alligator.</p>
      <p>Officers were attempting to lure an alligator from underneath a car, but when the reptile darted out from underneath, it sent everybody scrambling.</p>
      <p>The gator was eventually taken away from the underside of the car, and moved to a more favorable environment.</p>
