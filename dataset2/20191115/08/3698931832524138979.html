      <p>Sustaining a content site can be a challenge especially if you’re doing it full time. Ad revenue might not be sufficient and the next best option is to charge subscriptions for selected content, which is a model that’s adopted by a number of mainstream news websites. Now content creators on WordPress or Jetpack-powered websites are able to charge subscriptions easily with its new Recurring Payments feature. It is available now and it is supported in 135 countries.</p>

      <p>The Recurring Payments is introduced as a monetisation tool for content creators and it can be used to charge for newsletters, monthly donations or sell access to exclusive content through a simplified payment system. It is available to bloggers or creators on any paid WordPress.com plan which starts from USD 49 per year for the personal option.</p>
      <p>Although the login uses WordPress.com, the payment is handled by <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/07/stripe-malaysia-available-fpx-payment-accepted/">Stripe</a>. You can get started by going to the <a href="https://wordpress.com/earn/payments">Earn section</a> of WordPress and a Stripe account is needed in order to receive payments.</p>

      <p>Depending on which WordPress or Jetpack plan you’re on, WordPress will get a cut between 0-8%. On top of that, there are additional transaction fees for Stripe where they will charge 2.9% + USD0.30 per transaction.</p>

      <p>Overall, it is a hassle-free way for content creators to get monetary support from its readers. The only complaint is the high transaction fees above 10% if you’re on the entry-level WordPress or Jetpack plan. On top of that, it currently accepts credit and debit cards only.

      <p>Another alternative for content creators is to go on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a> which <a href="https://www.patreon.com/product/pricing">charges a lower 5%</a> fee on monthly income for the basic plan.
