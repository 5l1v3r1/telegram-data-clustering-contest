      <p>PERTH people will be given a taste of summer this weekend as the heatwave continues across Western Australia.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast a very hot and sunny day for Perth on Saturday with a scorching top of 35 degrees and zero per cent chance of rain.</p>
      <p>Winds are expected to be easterly with a speed of 20 to 30 km per hour becoming light in the morning then becoming westerly 15 to 20 km per hour in the middle of the day.</p>
      <p>Relief from the heat is in sight for Sunday which will be mostly sunny and a touch cooler with a top of 29 degrees, according to BoM.</p>
      <p>Expect light winds becoming west to southwesterly at 15 to 20 km per hour during the day then tending south to southwesterly during the evening.</p>
      <p>The UV index is expected to reach the extreme level of 12 across both Saturday and Sunday, so remember to slip, slop and slap.</p>
      <p>Make the most of the warm temperatures which are set to return down to the mid 20s next week.</p>
