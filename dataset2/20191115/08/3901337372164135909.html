      <p>A lot was said about Ronaldo's form for Juventus going into A Selecao's clash with Lithuania after he had been substituted by Maurizio Sarri in consecutive matches.</p>
      <p>The Italian boss suggested on both occasions that the 34-year-old was not at his physical best, but Portugal boss Fernando Santos insisted he had no doubts his star man was perfectly fine.</p>
      <p>"He's fine. I had no doubt about that, as I said before the match," he told <i>RTP</i>.</p>
      <p>"Other people did, but I didn't have any doubts."</p>

      <p>Ronaldo's international teammate Bruno Fernandes also hailed his attitude and spirit, before saying scoring a hat-trick is just standard procedure for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.</p>
      <p>"What we have is a very motivated Cristiano, who always gives his best," he said.  </p>
      <p>"He scored three times, which is normal for him."</p>
