      <p>Fans of <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> have been personally victimized by Shonda Rhimes and her plot twists many times over the past 16 seasons, but on Thursday night’s new episode — its 350th — the show really pulled out all of the stops. Meredith’s medical license hearing ended up being the perfect opportunity to break out the tissues. Y’all, it was rough, but in the best way possible.</p>

      <p>It was already a high stakes ep, being that we were about to find out if Meredith would ever operate again. But then, she sat down for her hearing and realized that one of the doctors was the one responsible for Derek’s death, and it all went downhill from there.</p>

      <p>It’s hard to say what the most emotional part of the episode was, because there were a lot of them. Meredith calling the doctor out for letting Derek die, Alex reading the letter from Cristina (and sharing that Arizona, Callie, and April had all written letters, too), seeing Meredith’s older patients testify for her, including Katie Bryce — it was so much.</p>

      <p>And just when it seems like the hits had stopped coming, boom. Derek’s doctor had died on the table, just like Derek had when he was hit by that car. It was such a full circle moment in such a heartbreaking way, especially after finding out that Meredith did get to keep her license.</p>
      <p>Tearjerker episodes are what <i>Grey’s</i> does best, and they don’t happen often enough anymore. Last season gave us a good one, with how emotional and powerful it was to see Jo meet her biological mother for the first time as her story ran parallel to a rape victim’s. But once a season isn’t enough — and more episodes like the one that aired on Thursday are crucial if this already long running show is going to continue to break records.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Hopefully, this episode is a sign that more like it are still to come. As the show inevitably continues to evolve, it shouldn’t leave behind what drew so many of us to fall in love with it in the first place: That emotional connection. What <i>Grey’s</i> does best is make people cry, whether those tears are happy or sad. And sometimes, there’s truly nothing better than a good TV sobfest, especially in the middle of a stressful week.</p>
      <p>Meredith is still a surgeon, and by doing that, <i>Grey’s</i> reminded me why I’ve stuck around with this show for so long while some of my friends have given up. Literally anytime this show wants to reference Cristina Yang or pull out flashbacks to Derek’s death, I am there — and I am crying.</p>

      <p>Living in 2019 is hard. The climate’s a mess, most of us still don’t have the rights we should have had hundreds of years ago, and we are all going broke from paying for so many streaming services right now. <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> is cathartic, and so is a good cry in front of your TV on a Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Keep doing what you’re doing, <i>Grey’s</i> — and more often. There are only so many times I can watch Meredith discover George getting hit by that bus and still feel something, so new sad content is 100% necessary.</p>
