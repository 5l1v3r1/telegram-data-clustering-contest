      <p>The Task force on Standards and Quality Infrastructure Reforms deals with the analyzing and evaluation of political, legal and legislative frameworks of different institutions and making appropriate recommendations that would work for the benefit of the institutions therein.</p>
      <p>Other appointees include John Konchellah as chairperson of the National Environmental Management Authority for a period of three years, an appointment by the President, with Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri appointing a team of 13 people to headline the Implementation of Miraa Taskforce Report.</p>

      <p>Through a gazette notice, Mucheru had appointed Robert Kochalle to serve as member of the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB).</p>
      <p>It later emerged that Kochalle passed on on 29, May 2018 while receiving treatment at the Aga Khan Hospital.</p>
      <p>The appointment ignited backlash with the ICT CS taking a u-turn and giving the job to the dead man’s widow, Charity Kochalle for a period of three years.</p>
