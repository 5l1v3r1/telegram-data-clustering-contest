      <h3>New 3D printer tech inches closer to holy grail of multi-material printing</h3>

      <p>A fresh innovation looks set to allow for much speedier 3D printing with multiple materials.</p>
      <p>As you may well be aware, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-3d-printer">3D printers</a> which can work with multiple materials already exist in a number of forms (including dual-extrusion models among others), but the problem is that whatever method is used to switch between materials is currently slower than ideal.</p>

      <p>That’s where a new multi-material multi-nozzle 3D (MM3D) printhead comes into play, as Nature.com reports. It is capable of printing with up to eight different materials from one nozzle – and there can be multiple nozzles – plus it can switch very quickly between those materials.</p>
      <p>All of which makes for a much more seamless and faster method of multiple-material 3D printing, while still maintaining a suitably fine level of detail.</p>

      <h4>Superfast switching</h4>
      <p>Or as the creators of the invention put it: “Our MM3D printheads exploit the diode-like behaviour that arises when multiple viscoelastic materials converge at a junction to enable seamless, high-frequency switching between up to eight different materials to create voxels with a volume approaching that of the nozzle diameter cubed.”</p>
      <p>As you can see in the video above, the folks behind the printhead have already used it to create a flexible origami sheet, and a ‘millipede-like soft robot’ capable of movement, the latter of which was printed using multiple epoxy and silicone elastomer inks of differing levels of stiffness.</p>
      <p>The eventual hope is that this printhead technology will be able to swiftly create flexible electronics or the likes of rechargeable batteries.</p>
