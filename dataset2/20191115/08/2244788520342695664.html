        <b>PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has issued a stern warning against the continued violence in Bayelsa and Kogi States a few days to the election, urged all agencies involved in the election process to be fair.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Elections in the two states scheduled  to hold on Saturday have been trailed with controversy and violence.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://frontpageng.com/just-in-buhari-speaks-on-kogi-bayelsa-elections/">statement</a> issued by the president through his media aide, Mallam Garba Shehu,  he urged law enforcement agencies to do their works to ensure a successful and violence-free election in the states.</p>
      <p>While he admonished politicians on the need to accept election outcome, he also said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has to be non-partisan</p>
      <p>His words:  “I call on voters in Bayelsa and Kogi states to exercise their franchise in a peaceful and orderly manner and in line with the law in all situations. Law enforcement officials must ensure that citizens are allowed to vote without harassment and intimidation and any attempt to steal or hijack ballots must be stopped using all legal means.</p>
      <p>“In all democratic elections, there are bound to be winners and losers and the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi will not be different. All candidates should be ready to accept the outcomes and wherever they are dissatisfied, they should follow the due process of the law in seeking redress. There must not be a resort to self-help.”</p>
      <p>Buhari wished the two states and their peoples a safe and credible exercise as they vote in “these historic and suspenseful elections.”</p>
      <p>However, in Bayelsa,<a href="https://www.icirnigeria.org/anxiety-brews-in-bayelsa/"> anxiety is raising</a> amongst the citizens as there is fear that there might be attacks and violence between contending members of the two major parties in the states-People’s Democratic Government and the All Progressive Congress due to the suspension of Lyon David the APC gubernatorial candidate.</p>
