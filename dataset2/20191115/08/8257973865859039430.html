      <h1>Brett Kavanaugh addresses legal group in first public speech since confirmation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:21:06+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">Darryl Coote</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 15 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/supreme-court/?tps=1">Supreme Court</a> Justice <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Brett-Kavanaugh/?tps=1">Brett Kavanaugh</a> was greeted with a standing ovation by members of the Federalist Society in Washington, D.C., as he gave his first public speech since being narrowly confirmed to the nation's highest court last year.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh said repeatedly during <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/kavanaugh-to-address-the-conservative-legal-establishment-that-championed-his-nomination/2019/11/14/81fb2aa6-0719-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">his address</a> Thursday night to some 2,000 members of the conservative lawyers network in attendance for the society's annual black-tie gala that he was grateful, optimistic and appreciative.</p>
      <p>"I will always be grateful," he said. "I will always be on the sunrise side of the mountain. I will always be not afraid."</p>
      <p>During his<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/brett-kavanaugh-address-conservatives-1st-public-speech-justice/story?id=66994462"> half-hour speech</a>, he spoke of his eight Supreme Court justices fondly, calling them "patriots" who "love our court and our country."</p>
      <p>In particular, he spoke highly of former President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bill_Clinton/?tps=1">Bill Clinton</a> appointee <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg/?tps=1">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, saying she is an "inspiration."</p>
      <p>"I'm grateful for Justice Ginsburg for being so generous to me," he said.</p>
      <p>The speech at the society's <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Antonin_Scalia/?tps=1">Antonin Scalia</a> Memorial Dinner as part of its 2019 National Lawyers Convention came a year after the Yale alumni's chance to sit at the high court was nearly dashed by <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/09/17/Kavanaugh-accuser-to-testify-on-sex-assault-allegation/2031537190803/?upi_ss=%22Christine+Blasey+Ford%22">allegations of sexual misconduct</a> that delayed his confirmation for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hear testimony from Kavanaugh and his accuser, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Christine-Blasey-Ford/?tps=1">Christine Blasey Ford</a>.</p>
      <p>During his speech he addressed the lengthy and public hearings, stating he is grateful to those who stood by him.</p>
      <p>"I signed up for what I know would be an ugly process -- maybe not that ugly -- but my friends did not. And yet in the midst of it all, they stood up and the stood by me,"<a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/470591-kavanaugh-hailed-by-conservative-gathering-in-first-public-speech"> he said</a>.</p>
      <p>However, not everyone was as receptive to his words as protesters inside Union Station and out continued their objections to his confirmation.</p>
      <p>Protesters with Demand Justice, a group aimed at reforming U.S. federal courts, <a href="https://twitter.com/WeDemandJustice/status/1195176489416822784?s=20">interrupted his speech</a> with whistles and yelling of "We believe survivors" before being escorted from the building.</p>
      <p>Outside, the group erected a large screen, blasting Ford's testimony from the confirmation hearing.</p>
      <p>"The Federalist Society is trying to rehabilitate a credibly accused sexual predator and we will not allow them to forget Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh's other accusers," Demand Justice Senior Counsel Katie O'Connor said in <a href="https://twitter.com/WeDemandJustice/status/1195130547619737600?s=20">a statement</a>. "Kavanaugh is not the hero of this story. We still believe Christine Blasey Ford and we won't let him forget that. Putting on a new robe can't be allowed to erase credible accusations of sexual assault."</p>
      <p>Alliance for Justice, a progressive judicial advocacy group, accused the Federalist Society of spending millions to get Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court because it was "confident" he would rule in their favor.</p>
      <p>"The wealthy and powerful members of the Federalist Society spent millions of dollars supporting Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court," said Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron in <a href="https://afj.org/press-room/press-releases/sen-whitehouse-and-afj-decry-kavanaughs-federalist-society-appearance">a statement</a>. "... How could anyone who enters the Supreme Court believe that Kavanaugh will rule fairly and without bias knowing how invested he is in the Federalist Society's extremely partisan mission?"</p>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Sheldon_Whitehouse/?tps=1">Sheldon Whitehouse</a>, D-R.I., an outspoken critic of the court, said the White House has "in-sourced" the society to select President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>'s justice nominees, calling it a machine run by its executive vice president, Leonard Leo, to turn "hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money into federal judges."</p>
      <p>"A private organization funded by anonymous donors having an improper role in the selection of judges and justices is bad enough," Whitehouse said in a statement. "A Supreme Court justice returning favors to that organization is even worse."</p>
