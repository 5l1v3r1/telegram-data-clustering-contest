        <b>Great Britain curler Eve Muirhead has admitted that continuing hip trouble means the next Winter Olympics in Beijing could be her last.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Scot, who took bronze at Sochi 2014, says she will push for an Olympic spot in 2022 then "see what happens".</p>
      <p>Despite surgery in 2018, she told BBC Scotland it is "difficult to play with this pain".</p>
      <p>"You have good days and bad days; I can't really control it," she said.</p>
      <p>Muirhead will take part in her 10th European Championships in Helsingborg, Sweden, starting this weekend.</p>
      <p>She has gathered eight medals for Scotland from her nine previous visits, including gold in 2017 and 2011.</p>
      <p>"Every day I do rehab and try to keep on top of it," she said of her condition. "But I would rather be tired and pain free than be all jolly. There's a lot of pain. It's a lot of time and effort. Being a full-time athlete, its always going to be hard.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I'm getting old. I'm 30 in a few months and I feel like I'm getting to the mid to end of my career, so I really want to push for that last Olympic spot and from then on, who knows what I will do."</p>
      <p>Muirhead was just 19 when she made her Olympic debut in Vancouver in 2010 and went into the 2014 Games in Russia as world champion.</p>
      <p>After narrowly missing out on another bronze medal at Pyeongchang 2018, the skip had keyhole surgery, similar to that undertaken by tennis star Andy Murray 12 months before he had a form of hip replacement.</p>
      <p>"The next few years I know I'm in a good spot and can still play well, so I will buckle down, keep working hard with the physios, the coaches, and see what happens," she said of her quest for a fourth Olympic appearance.</p>
      <p>"When I went through my op and off the back of coming fourth at the Olympics, it wasn't a great year to be honest. It was a bit of a struggle. I dealt with it quite well and I asked for help when I needed to.</p>
      <p>"Every athlete goes through good times and bad times, that's a fact. It can be very tough at times, but then at others, its great. I try not to let anything get me down."</p>
