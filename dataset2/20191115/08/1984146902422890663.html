      <h2>Tyneside village will be first in the UK to use new type of gas supply which includes hydrogen, in effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Henderson</a></address>
      <p>The gas could always be greener under a project which will see households in the North East helping to tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>A total of 670 homes and businesses in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/winlaton">Winlaton</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a>, will become the first on a public UK gas network to use blended hydrogen for heating and cooking to cut climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
      <p>Winlaton will be the location for the next stage of HyDeploy, a pioneering energy pilot exploring how by adding 20% zero-carbon hydrogen into the natural gas network, the UK can reduce emissions without changing customers’ appliances or behaviour.</p>
      <p>Mark Horsley, chief executive of Northern Gas Networks, said: “The North East has been a hotbed of innovation and engineering achievements since the 1800s, and we’re very proud to join this roster by bringing HyDeploy to Winlaton.”</p>
      <p>The first phase of the HyDeploy project is about to start at Keele University in Staffordshire, where customers on a private gas network will be using blended hydrogen for heating and cooking. The technology used in both phases is identical.</p>
      <p>When burnt, hydrogen only produces heat and water, making it a realistic solution for tackling decarbonisation as the UK looks towards its Net Zero emissions target of 2050.</p>
      <p>From December 2020, 670 homes and businesses in Winlaton will receive gas blended with 20% hydrogen, in a demonstration lasting 10 months.</p>
      <p>The pilot will require no disruption for customers in terms of their gas appliances, or the way they use gas at home.</p>
      <p>Backed by £22.5million of OFGEM innovation funding, HyDeploy is led by gas distributors Northern Gas Networks and Cadent, in partnership with the Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive, clean energy project management specialists Progressive Energy, and a consortium of industry experts, who jointly, will lead the safe management of the pilot over the next two years.</p>
      <p>HyDeploy is also supported by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead-council">Gateshead Council</a>, as part of its commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
      <p>Coun John McElroy, Gateshead Council cabinet member for environment and transport, said: “We all have a duty to act to help prevent further climate breakdown, which is already causing serious damage around the world.</p>
      <p>“Gateshead Council has committed to being carbon neutral by 2030, and by taking part in innovative pilots such as these we can further help ensure Gateshead is making a positive contribution to reversing the effects of climate change.”</p>
      <p>The Winlaton demonstration will help inform how hydrogen could be used more widely in a practical, affordable way, and will be the first time most customers will have experienced using it for energy in their homes.</p>
      <p>The hydrogen will be produced by an ITM Power electrolyser, powered by renewable sources. This technology uses an electrical current to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
      <p>Ed Syson, Cadent chief safety and strategy officer, said: “Gas networks have a role to play in the UK’s future energy needs, alongside wind and solar. We believe that using the existing network to deliver greener gas is the most cost-effective way of heating homes in the net zero future.”</p>
      <p>Heating homes and industry accounts for nearly half of all energy use in the UK and one third of the country’s carbon emissions. More than 80 per cent of homes in the UK are heated by gas.</p>
      <p>If hydrogen was blended with natural gas across the UK at a similar level to HyDeploy, it could save around six million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions every year, the equivalent of taking 2.5 million cars off the road.</p>
