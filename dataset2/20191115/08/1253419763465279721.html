      <h1>Script Hook &amp; Native Trainer released for Red Dead Redemption 2, allows you to do A LOT of things</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Alexander Blade has just released a script hook for Red Dead Redemption 2. As the modder noted, Script Hook RDR 2 is the library that allows you to use RDR 2 script native functions in custom *.asi plugins.</p>
      <p>In case you aren’t aware of, Alexander’s ScriptHook for GTA5 was used as base for big part of all released script mods. In other words, this release opens up the road for script mods.</p>
      <p>This mod only works with Red Dead Redemption 2. When players try to connect online, Script Hook closes the game. As such, modders – and all other gamers using it – will be safe, and won’t receive any penalty.</p>
      <p>As the title suggests, this mod also comes with a native trainer. Via this trainer, players can reveal the whole map, add unlimited horse stamina, and make their horse invisible. Not only that, but they can also teleport to wherever they want.</p>
      <p>This trainer comes with A LOT of options, so I suggest downloading and having fun with it.</p>
      <p>You can download the Script Hook/Native Trainer mod for Red Dead Redemption 2 from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/56">here</a>.</p>
