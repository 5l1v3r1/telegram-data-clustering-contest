      <p><b>NEW ORLEANS – </b>Paul George expected to shoot well in his Clippers’ debut because his surgically repaired shoulders felt great.</p>
      <p>It was the rest of his game — from ball handling to defense — that concerned him.</p>
      <p>Jrue Holiday scored 36 points and stole the ball from George three times in the final minutes to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 132-127 victory over Los Angeles on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was terrible,” said George, who was limited to 24 minutes by early foul trouble but still scored 33 points.</p>
      <p>“That’s the best my shoulders have felt in a really long time, so I knew coming into tonight shooting wouldn’t be a problem,” George added. “Just playing basketball is what I’m lacking right now.”</p>
      <p>George was playing for the first time since signing as a free agent with the Clippers because he’d been recovering from procedures in May on his right shoulder and June on his left.</p>
      <p>“A lot of breakdowns happened because of my lack of being out there with those guys,” George said. “I’m here to win games and I didn’t get a win. . . . We had a chance to win tonight and a couple bad possessions in a row that we have down the stretch and we lose. That’s what I gauge good games and bad games on.”</p>
      <p>Holiday, who had six steals in all, intercepted of Lou Williams’ attempted bounce pass in the final seconds to seal the victory. The play capped off a night in which Holiday scored 12 in the final 4:20, including a pair of pivotal 3s.</p>
      <p>“It felt good,” said Holiday, who hadn’t scored as many as 20 points in any of his previous eight games. “It’s all about timing and rhythm. I felt like I got a little bit of that back tonight.”</p>
      <p>Derrick Favors, in his first season with New Orleans, had 20 points and a career-best 20 rebounds in the first 20-20 game of his 10-year career.</p>
      <p>“I’m starting to get comfortable now and just try to keep it going throughout the year,” Favors said. “It was a great game for me, a great game for the team, and we came out and played hard, but we just have to stay consistent.”</p>
      <p>Teammate Frank Jackson added 23 points in a reserve role.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles played without Kawhi Leonard, who was being rested for the third time this season to ease stress on his sore knee after playing a night earlier in a loss at Houston. But the Pelicans were hardly sympathetic with starters Brandon Ingram (right knee) and Lonzo Ball (groin) sidelined, as well.</p>
      <p>George’s 3 cut the Pelicans’ lead to 126-123 with 42 seconds left. But the Clippers left Jackson unguarded on the perimeter on the other end, and he took his time squaring up and connecting on his fourth 3 of the game to restore New Orleans’ six-point lead with 30 seconds left.</p>
      <p>J.J. Reddick, who started and scored 19, hit two free throws with 11.4 seconds left to help wrap up just the Pelicans’ third victory in 11 games this season.</p>
      <p>Williams scored 31 points and Rodney McGruder 20 for Los Angeles, which has dropped two straight.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Suns 128, Hawks 112</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Phoenix, Kelly Oubre Jr. scored a season-high 30 points, Devin Booker added 27 and the Suns routed Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Phoenix (7-4) is off to its best start through 11 games since 2009, when they started 9-2.</p>
      <p>Dario Saric added 23 points after shooting 9 of 12 from the field, including 3 of 5 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>Jabari Parker led the Hawks (4-7) with 24 points. Trae Young had 21 points and 13 assists two nights after a 42-point, 11-assist performance in a win over Denver.</p>
