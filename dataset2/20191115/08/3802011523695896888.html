      <p>Mr Farage also said his candidates received “thousands of phone calls and emails” trying to get them to withdraw ahead of next month’s election.</p>
      <p>He made the claims shortly after candidate nominations closed before the 12 December poll.</p>
      <p>The Tories denied offering Brexit Party candidates jobs or peerages.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage has confirmed his candidates will not contest seats won by the Tories at the 2017 general election, but will stand candidates against the party elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Conservative figures have urged his party not to run in Labour-held marginal constituencies, fearing his candidates could divide the Brexit-backing vote.</p>
      <p>In a video posted on Twitter, Mr Farage said that he, along with eight “senior figures” in his party, had been offered peerages to stand down.</p>
      <p>He said the offer had been made by people “deep inside Number 10 Downing Street” – although he did not think Prime Minister Boris Johnson was involved.</p>
      <p>“As you can imagine, I said I do not want, and I will never have, anything to do with this kind of behaviour,” he said.</p>
      <p>A Tory source has told the BBC the Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough was offered an unpaid role in education in the hope it would convince him to stand aside.</p>
      <p>Mike Greene is standing for the party in the Cambridgeshire constituency, which Labour held narrowly at a by-election in June.</p>
      <p>It is understood friends of Mr Greene had indicated that the role could be enough of an inducement.</p>
      <p>Mr Greene’s team confirmed the offer of a role had been made to him, but said their candidate would definitely be running.</p>
      <h3>‘Calls, emails and threats’</h3>
      <p>Mr Farage also later said his candidates had been “subjected to thousands of phone calls, and emails and threats all over the country” to get them to stand aside.</p>
      <p>He said candidates had been offered jobs “in the negotiating team, jobs in government departments and hints at peerages too”.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: “We don’t do electoral pacts – our pact is with the British people.”</p>
      <p>“The only way to get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential is to vote for your local Conservative candidate”.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Question Time, Conservative party chairman James Cleverly said allegations that his party has offered peerages were “completely unfounded”.</p>
      <p>“There are a number of people who went to the Brexit Party, who had been up until very, very recently Conservatives,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I have no doubt that Conservatives will have spoken to people they know locally and said ‘if you genuinely want to deliver Brexit, the only way of doing that is with a Conservative majority government’.</p>
      <p>“I have no doubt conversations like that have been happening up and down the country.”</p>
      <p>But he added: “I’m telling you that I have no truck with a pact or agreements. Nigel Farage has asked for one for months. We said no.”</p>
      <p>Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: “It looks like Boris Johnson is trying to stitch-up this election by offering jobs to Brexit party candidates to get them to stand down.</p>
      <p>“This gives a whiff of the corrupt way the establishment works. We can’t allow the Tories to run the country a minute longer. It’s time for real change.”</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said the Conservative Party had seen a “hard-right takeover” that “has now been endorsed by both Trump and Farage”.</p>
      <p>“As Nigel Farage has admitted, the Liberal Democrats are the only party at this election that can take seats from the Conservatives, stop Brexit and build a brighter future,” he added.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50426535"><b> BBC News</b></a></p>
