      <p>Newcastle United fans are all saying the same thing after Miguel Almiron netted the winning goal for Paraguay last night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/miguel-almiron">Almiron</a> scored the only goal of the game as La Albirroja ran out 1-0 winners over Bulgaria in a friendly win in Sofia.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old picked up the ball on the edge of the box, shifted the ball on to his left foot and whipped a fierce effort past Bulgaria goalkeeper Georgi Georgiev to give his side the lead.</p>
      <p>It was his second goal in three international games for his country - in stark contrast to his goalscoring form at Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Almiron arrived on Tyneside for a then club record fee in January and his form helped Newcastle transform their season.</p>
      <p>Ex-Magpies boss Rafa Benitez and current Newcastle manager Steve Bruce are both big fans of the former Atlanta United star, particularly his work rate, pace, and ability to create a chance for himself or a team-mate in difficult situations.</p>
      <p>The one thing that has been lacking is a goal for the Magpies. He has had a glut of huge opportunities this season to end his duck and for one reason or another it just hasn't happened.</p>

      <p>Almiron boasted an impressive goalscoring record for Atlanta, finding the net 22 times in 70 games for the 2018 MLS Cup champions.</p>
      <p>But after a goalbound effort struck team-mate <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/allan-saint-maximin">Allan Saint-Maximin</a> before ballooning over an empty net against Bournemouth last weekend, fans started to question whether he just wasn't meant to score for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>But a well taken goal for his country on Thursday evening has offered hope and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> fans are now desperate for him to transfer his form in front of goal for his country to club level.</p>
      <p>'Squashy' took to Twitter to joke: "Put a Paraguay top on Almiron and he might start doing the business for us."</p>
      <p>Adam Beckett added: "Miguel Almirón has scored a goal. It’s happened. Not for Newcastle of course, but still. He can do it!"</p>
      <p>And Murray White tweeted: "Almiron got a goal for Paraguay. Hopefully gives him some confidence in front of goal and can get off the mark in black-and-white soon."</p>
