        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 15 – Sebastian Vettel has responded to Max Verstappen’s controversial claims that Ferrari were guilty of “cheating”, saying the Dutchman’s comments were “not professional”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ferrari have found themselves at the centre of controversy with rivals questioning the legality of the Scuderia’s power unit.</p>
      <p>That led to the FIA issuing a Technical Directive relating to fuel flow, which was almost immediately followed by a drop-off in Ferrari’s pace.</p>
      <p>Verstappen told the media that’s “what happens when you stop cheating”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Vettel was not impressed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Well I think it is a sign of our times that a lot of people have something to say,” the German told Autosport when asked about Verstappen’s comments.</p>
      <p>“I think the big difference to the past is a lot of people are being heard, whereas maybe before they were being ignored.</p>
      <p>“Everybody is free to say what they want, and if that’s what he thinks, that’s what he may think, but obviously we have a different opinion.”</p>
      <p>He added: “As I said, everybody is free to say what they want.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anybody in the team took it personally.</p>
      <p>“I think it is not professional, or mature, but I can also see that you are probably interested in me answering back, and I don’t have much interest in that, other to say that for us, the best way to answer is to go back to normal.</p>
      <p>“We are not proud of how we performed in Austin on Sunday. After Saturday nobody had the need to complain.</p>
      <p>“On Sunday we probably struggled with more than one thing, conditions, tyres, set-up, which are things we need to work on, but calling it that far is just not right.</p>
      <p>“But again, live and let live, so if that’s what he thinks, that’s what he thinks.</p>
      <p>“If next week he thinks something different, in the end, we don’t care so much.”</p>
      <p>As for Verstappen, the Red Bull driver was a lot more cautious in his comments when questioned in Brazil on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I prefer not to comment on it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s much more important we look ahead and focus on the last two races, and just fight it out on track.”</p>
