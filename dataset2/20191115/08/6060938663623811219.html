      <p>NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the path for steelmaker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ArcelorMittal">ArcelorMittal</a> SA to take over <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bankrupt-Essar-Steel">bankrupt Essar Steel</a>, following a legal tussle that has dragged through multiple courts for over two years.</p>
      <p>The top court allowed Arcelor to make payment for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Essar-Steel-India-Ltd">Essar Steel India Ltd</a> and said operational creditors cannot be treated on par with financial creditors of a bankrupt company, in a ruling that provides relief to lenders and sets a precedent that could speed-up the resolution of other insolvency cases.</p>
      <p>The lenders’ panel of a bankrupt company has discretion in the distribution of funds in insolvencies, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, banks had moved the SC after an appellate court judgment put the claims of Essar’s operational creditors on par with those of its lenders.</p>
      <p>The acquisition of Essar Steel India Ltd will make Arcelor the fourth-biggest producer in a nation where the government is investing trillions in infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The verdict is likely to be the final approval in a more than year-long battle by Arcelor to take over Essar. While companies can seek a review of decision by the same bench of judges, the success of review petitions is rare.</p>
      <p>Essar Steel, with debts from banks worth nearly Rs 50,000 crore ($7.01 billion), was among the so called dirty dozen - twelve large steel and other infrastructure companies which defaulted and were referred to the bankruptcy court in 2017.</p>
