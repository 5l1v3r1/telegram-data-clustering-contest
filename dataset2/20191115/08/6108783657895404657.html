      <h1>Final Fantasy XIV coming to Xbox One, says Phil Spencer</h1>

      <h3>Alongside a large chunk of the Final Fantasy and Yakuza franchises.</h3>
      <p>At X019 today, Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed that <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/final-fantasy-xiv/"><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></a> is heading to Xbox One.</p>
      <p>The news came as Spencer confirmed a number of popular Japanese titles from the <i>Final Fantasy </i>and <i>Yakuza </i>franchises would be available on Xbox One very shortly.</p>
      <p>“One of the things I’m incredibly proud of is the third-party partnerships that we’ve been able to announce and we’ll be announcing here today to all of our fans,” Spencer began. “As some of you might know, I have an affinity for going to Japan and building relationships with the Japanese publishers — something that I thought we missed earlier in the generation as Xbox.</p>
      <p>“Now we’re here at X0 and what are we talking about? We’re talking about <i>Yakuza</i> coming to Xbox for the first time, not only coming to Xbox but also as part of Xbox Game Pass. <i>Yakuza 0, Yakuza Kiwami </i>and <i>Yakuza Kiwami 2</i> [are] all coming to Xbox, all coming to Xbox Game Pass.</p>
      <p>“<i>Final Fantasy 7</i>, <i>8</i> — all the way through you’re going to see the full collection of final fantasy coming to Xbox, coming to Xbox Game Pass. So those Xbox fans that maybe have heard of these franchises and not thought that they were franchises for their platform, they’re going to be able to play those games. They can buy those games, or they can play them as part of the subscription,” Spencer continued.</p>
      <p>“The astute people out there might have noticed that there was one <i>Final Fantasy</i> that’s missing in our list which is <i>XIV</i>, and <i>XIV</i> is one that I’ve been dedicated to working with Yoshida-san to find a solution to bring that game to Xbox. And while it’s not all in the news today, I wanted you to know rest assured that we will be bringing that game to Xbox. We have great relationship with Yoshida-san, and we’re working through what it means to bring a cross platform MMO that they’ve run for years. But it will be one of the games that’s coming and it’s something that I know that our Xbox fans will be incredibly excited to see.”</p>
      <p>We’ll have more on <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/final-fantasy-xiv/">Final Fantasy XIV</a> </i>on Xbox One as information becomes available.</p>
