      <p>Amazon India is hosting ‘Mi Days’ sale on their platform from 14th to 18th November <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/14/amazon-india-kicks-off-apple-and-oppo-products-sale/">similar</a> to ‘Apple Days’ and ‘Oppo Fantastic Days’ Sale. The e-commerce giant has partnered with HDFC bank to offer a 10% cashback up to ₹500 on selected products. Additionally, buyers can opt for exchange offers and no-cost EMIs to further lower the price.</p>
      <p>To begin with, the ‘Mi Days’ sale by Amazon India does not offer much except for the instant discount via HDFC band debit cards and a few no-cost EMI options. The devices on the sale include Redmi 7A, Redmi 7, Redmi Y3, Mi A2, Mi A3, and POCO F1. We have listed the price of these models along with offers in the table below.</p>
