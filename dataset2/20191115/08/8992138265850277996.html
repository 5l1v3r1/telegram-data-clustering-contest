      <p>Founded in 2011, Blockchain.com is one of the oldest companies in the crypto arena and is known for it’s free to use Bitcoin wallet. According to its website, it runs over 43 million wallets, which have transacted over $200 billion with “the lowest fees in the industry.”</p>
      <p>Despite the impressive numbers and popularity of the platform, the company faced harsh criticism due to chaos in its management. The company laid off dozens of its employees amid crypto winter and also faced the departure of <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/blockchain-com-to-see-departure-of-two-more-top-executives/">several reputed executives</a> within months of their joining.</p>

      <p>The jump of the wallet and data platform into the digital asset lending business is reasonable, given the massive demand for such services in the industry. According to Bloomberg, the crypto lending industry significantly surged in the last couple of years, touching $5 billion.</p>
