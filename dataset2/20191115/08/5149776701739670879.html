      <h1>'Shop window' - Former Nottingham Forest youngster hoping to end West Brom nightmare</h1>
      <h2>Oliver Burke has struggled to live up to the billing since leaving Forest a little over three years ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Oliver Burke hopes his move to Spain will see him find the form which will put him firmly back in the shop window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/i-didnt-chuck-over-there-415654">Since leaving Nottingham Forest</a> for £13m in 2016, Burke has endured something of a nomadic existence, moving to Germany then Scotland back to England and finally to Iberia for the remainder of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old made three appearances for West Brom at the start of the season, including in the 2-1 win at the City Ground before moving to La Liga and has since played nine times for the Basque-based club, the most recent coming in last weekend's 3-0 win over Valladolid.</p>
      <p>“I’m really enjoying it. We had a good result at the weekend, so it’s going really well,” Burke said while <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/oliver-burke-scotland-nottingham-forest-3420217">on Scotland duty</a>.</p>

      <p>“I’m learning a lot each day – the coaching staff speak English very well.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of video meetings, they talk to me one-to-one and it’s really nice to know somebody wants to help you and get the best out of you.</p>
      <p>“I feel really happy there and I’m developing as much as I can.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/i-lost-confidence-oliver-burke-680438">Burke’s big money move</a> to Leipzig came to an end in 2017 when he moved to West Brom for £15m, before being farmed out to Celtic on loan last season, a switch which didn't really work out.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international has played just 24 times for the Baggies in total, with Burke admitting his journey since leaving <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the City Ground</a> has been far from ideal.</p>
      <p>“For me, it’s been really frustrating.</p>
      <p>“Not staying at one club and cementing a spot.</p>
      <p>“I think this is part and parcel of my career right now, it’s the way it’s going for me.</p>

      <p>“I’d love to be at a club and be the first name on the teamsheet every week – I think it will come with time.”</p>
      <p>Despite being largely restricted to coming off the bench in Spain, Burke says he’s doing everything within his power to improve.</p>
      <p>“I’m still at a good age and I’m doing everything I can now to learn the game.</p>
      <p>“When opportunities do come, I hope I'm able to cement a spot, stay in the team and get a good run of games because that’s what I need right now to get as much confidence as possible.</p>
      <p>“Good times are coming.”</p>

      <p>What will become of his future at West Brom remains to be seen for Burke, though as it stands, it would appear his stay at the Hawthorns is coming towards a conclusion.</p>
      <p>“The situation at West Brom is very difficult right now because I’ve been there for so long, but haven’t played many games for them.</p>
      <p>“You feel that you’re not so much part of that team because I’ve been to other clubs, it can be difficult.</p>
      <p>“The lads are great with me when I go back, it’s a really good environment to be in.</p>
      <p>“For me now, I have to focus on this loan, take it all in and hopefully good things come from me going on loan.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it puts me in the shop window.”</p>
