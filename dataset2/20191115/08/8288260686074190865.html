      <p>A dog miraculously survived after being impaled on a SPIKE that cut right through its stomach.</p>
      <p>German wire-haired pointer Angus was out for an afternoon walk with his owner when he jumped into a ditch.</p>
      <p>Angus was caught on a metal stake hidden in the undergrowth.</p>
      <p>Vets raced to the scene of the freak accident in in Enborne, near Newbury, Berks. to try and save the stricken pooch.</p>
      <p>They gave him fluids to bring bring his blood pressure up while staff back at the practice in nearby Thatcham prepared for life-saving surgery.</p>

      <p>He was then put under the knife for four hours and spent eight days recovering before being allowed home.</p>
      <p>And an x-ray taken at the Donnington Grove Veterinary Group showed that the stake had entered Angus’s chest near his armpit, through his diaphragm into his abdomen but amazingly missed all of his vital organs.</p>

      <p>Lucy Mapplebeck, a veterinary nurse at Donnington Grove, said: “It is very unusual for us to have to go out to the animal where it is injured. We do see serious conditions, but a complete freak accident like this is very unusual.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The dog was in shock so needed a lot of fluids to get his blood pressure back up and we quickly realised the only way to save his life was to go ahead with surgery as we didn’t think he would have made the journey to a referral unit.</p>
      <p>“He was in surgery for four hours and it was one of the most complicated surgeries I have ever seen.”</p>

      <p>Vet Will Hodge and trainee veterinary nurse Lindsey Morris treated him at the scene while fellow vet Emma Pritchard and a team of nurses, from both the day and night shifts, were also involved in the complicated thoracotomy operation.</p>
      <p>A chest drain was put in place to remove the air and fluid from the dog’s chest and he spent a number of days in intensive care and on very strong pain killers after the incident.</p>

      <p>Angus spent a total eight days at the vets, being visited twice a day by his worried owners, before being allowed home.</p>
      <p>He is still having regular check-ups but is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>“It was a complete freak accident and we are really proud of the outcome,” Ms Mapplebeck added.</p>
