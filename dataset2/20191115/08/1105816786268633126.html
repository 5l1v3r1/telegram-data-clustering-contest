      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Opposition parties in the National Assembly on Friday announced withdrawal of a no-confidence motion against Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri after the government acquiesced to the their demand for a review of the bills passed by the house a little over a week ago.</p>
      <p>The rare compromise came after extensive discussions between lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. The laws cleared by the lower house of parliament in its November 7 sitting will now be tabled in the relevant standing committees, while the opposition will not pursue its no-trust motion against Suri.</p>
      <p>“Consensus has been reached between the opposition and the treasury that the ordinances passed by the house the other day will be withdrawn and will be passed later with consensus, so we also withdraw our motion against the deputy speaker,” PML-N leader Khawaja Asif said.</p>
      <p>He said the opposition had moved the no-confidence motion against the deputy speaker in protest after the treasury bulldozed the ordinances through the house. “It would have been much better if the deputy speaker had allowed the opposition to speak on the ordinances,” he added.</p>
      <p>Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak said that government officials and opposition leaders have agreed in their meetings over the past few days to move forward together to ensure smooth functioning of parliament.</p>
      <p>In the November 7 sitting, chaired by Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, the house had passed a record number of government bills in a little over an hour, amid a vociferous protest from the opposition lawmakers who were not allowed to speak.</p>

      <p>The treasury had introduced a total of 15 bills; of which 11 were approved with majority. The bills also incorporated nine presidential ordinances, including seven recently promulgated ones. The house also gave a 120-day extension to three ordinances.</p>
      <p>Giving details of the agreement reached between the treasury and the opposition, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Swati said the Benami Transaction (Prohibition) (Amendment) Bill and the National Accountability (Amendment) Bill would be referred to the relevant standing committees.</p>
      <p>Similarly, he added, more discussions would be held on the Medical Tribunal Ordinance, Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance and the Whistle blower Protection and Vigilance Commission Ordinance, and consensus would be developed on these bills.</p>
      <p>He also said that the Letters of Administration and Succession Certificates Ordinance; the Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Ordinance; the Legal Aid and Justice Authority Ordinance; and the Superior Courts (Court Dress and Mode of Address) Ordinance would be withdrawn.</p>
      <p>Defence Minister Khattak said the government has “decided to improve the assembly’s atmosphere”. He thanked the opposition for showing flexibility. “The house will conduct its business with consensus,” he added.</p>
      <p>Former speaker Ayaz Sadiq, who belongs to the PML-N, said that debate on proposed laws would improve the stature of the house. Former prime minister and PPP lawmaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf praised the ruling party for withdrawing the ordinances.</p>
      <p>Former finance minister Asad Umar of the ruling PTI said that smooth proceedings of the house was a collective responsibility of both the opposition and the treasury benches. He lauded the opposition’s decision to withdraw the no-confidence motion against Suri.</p>
      <p>“All of us have come here [in the assembly] with public vote and we should focus on solving their problems,” he said. “Legislation done by parliamentary committees is more effective. After five years, people will say that Speaker Asad Qaiser strengthened this house.”</p>

        <b>November 7 session and its fallout</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MQM-P lawmaker Aminul Haq urged the government to allow ailing former premier Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for treatment of his critical ailment.</p>
      <p>Grand Democratic Alliance’s Ghous Bux Khan Mahar endorsed Haq’s demand and said that the government “should not do politics over Nawaz Sharif’s health”. He added that the government’s condition for Nawaz to submit an indemnity bond in order to travel abroad was “ridiculous”.</p>
      <p>During the question hour, PTI’s Aslam Khan and PML-N’s Ali Gohar raised the issue of dual nationality of certain advisers and federal secretaries. State Minister Ali Muhammad pledged to present a report in the house soon.</p>
      <p>The minister said that he hoped the opposition members would also raise the same question within their respective parties. He also told the house the government was endevouring to recover the laundered money. “It is not just the politicians, ordinary people also laundered money,” he revealed.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question from Sohail Ayaz, Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari admitted that the PTI-led Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government should have run a background check before hiring a man as consultant, who was convicted for pedophile sex offences in the UK.</p>
      <p>PPP’s Abdul Qadir Patel demanded that a committee be formed to look into the matter. “Who hired [the suspect] and over whose recommendation?” he asked. Mazari said she “condemned the incident”.</p>
