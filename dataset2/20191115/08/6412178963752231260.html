        <b>Inter Milan have formulated a plan to keep a £95m Man Utd and Man City target at the San Siro, while Everton are keen on signing a Nottingham Forest winger – all in Friday’s papers.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>INTER PLOT MOVE TO KEEP MAN UTD, CITY TARGET</h3>
      <p>Manchester United and Manchester City are set to battle it out for <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/lautaro-martinez"><b>Lautaro Martinez</b></a>, but Inter Milan reportedly have a plan to stop them.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old striker has been in fine form for Inter this season, scoring eight goals in 15 games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The Argentina star has also netted eight times in 11 appearances for his country in the calendar year and is regarded as one of the hottest properties in European club football.</p>
      <p>That has led to strong rumours of a move to the Premier League next summer, with United and City both showing an interest in the attacker.</p>

      <p>But <i>Calciomercato</i> have now revealed how Antonio Conte’s side will try to retain the services of their forward – by doubling his salary.</p>
      <p>The former Racing Club forward has a mammoth release clause of £95million that is open between July 1 to July 15 for clubs outside of Italy, but his current side want to increase that by tempting him with a deal worth £1.2m a year.</p>
      <p>United and City are not the only clubs keen on Martinez, however, with Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona also admirers of the young hotshot.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the report adds that Barca are ready to use Ousmane Dembele as part of a swap deal in the hope that will put them at the top of the queue for the player’s services.</p>
