      <p>A PERTH man has been fined $2500 for tearing the head off Kevin the kookaburra at the Parkerville Tavern last month.</p>
      <p>The man has been issued the maximum infringement for the offence of “the unlawful take of fauna” that occurred on October 25 in front of horrified children.</p>
      <p>The Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions said it was the first time a person had been fined the maximum amount for the offence since new laws came into force on January 1.</p>
      <p>Even though kookaburras are not native to Western Australia, they are classified as fauna under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 which means people must not take or disturb them without lawful authority.</p>
