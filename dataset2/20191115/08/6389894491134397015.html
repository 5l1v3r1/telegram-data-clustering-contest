      <p>Talk Talk revealed a £4m half-year profit today amid reports that it is close to a deal to sell its Fibrenation sister company to Cityfibre, the UK’s largest alternative broadband network provider.</p>
      <p>Sky News reported that although sources warned that the deal had not yet been finalised, there was a chance the agreement could be announced this morning.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p>It was a strong first half for Talk Talk, with rapid customer growth in fibre driving earnings to a 14 per cent rise year on year for the six months to the end of September.</p>
      <p>A new 300,000 fibre customers in the first half of thew financial year turned a £4m loss this time last year into a <b>£4m profit before tax</b>.</p>
      <p>The company was responsible for 33 per cent of all new Openreach fibre to cabinet lines installed in the period.</p>
      <p>But <b>revenue slipped</b> 3.6 per cent year on year to<b> £792m</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Net debt increased</b> to <b>£830m</b>, from £760m in 2019, driven largely by capital outflows from accelerated fibre growth, the cost of switching headquarters, and continued investment in sister company Fibre Nation.</p>
      <p><b>Basic earnings per share dipped </b>0.3 per cent to 1p. Talk Talk <b>maintained an interim dividend</b> of <b>1p per share</b>.</p>
      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>In its results Talktalk said that it was undertaking “ongoing advanced negotiations with interested parties” regarding the sale of Fibrenation.</p>
      <p>Cityfibre’s offer would see the Goldman Sachs backed company, which has set a target of connecting five million homes by 2025, take full control of Fibrenation.</p>
      <p>The news comes after the Labour party announced plans to nationalise BT’s Openreach infrastructure division, a move it said would cost £20bn.</p>

      <h3>What Talk Talk said</h3>
      <p>Tristia Harrison, chief executive of Talktalk, said:</p>
      <p>“We’re pleased that our clear strategy to accelerate customer growth in fibre broadband while also reducing costs has led to a significant increase in profitability in the first half, with a 14% year-on-year increase in like-for-like EBITDA. We now have over two million customers taking a fibre product, adding nearly 300,000 customers in the half.</p>
      <p>“Fibre broadband is good news for customers and Talktalk. It offers a faster, more reliable service whilst also reducing churn and comes with a materially lower cost to serve. In addition, our soon to be completed HQ move and shift to a self-service model is underpinning our cost reductions.”</p>
