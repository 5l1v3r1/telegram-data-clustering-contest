      <p><b>McCarran International Airport</b> (LAS) travelers can now get a taste of Shake Shack, the modern day “<i>roadside</i>” burger stand that got started in New York in 2001 and continues to build a devoted fan base all over the world. Global restaurateur HMSHost, with partner MB Concession, is now serving Shake Shack to McCarran’s Terminal 1 in the Rotunda Area that connects the A and B Concourses.</p>
      <p><b>Shake Shack </b>is known for its 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers and flat-top Vienna beef dogs (no added hormones and no antibiotics ever), 100% all-natural cage-free chicken (no antibiotics ever), spun-fresh frozen custard, crinkle cut fries, craft beer and wine (available at select locations) and more. Shake Shack’s fine dining heritage and commitment to premium ingredients, coupled with its fun and lively environment, has earned the brand a cult-like following around the world. McCarran’s new Shake Shack takes advantage of the spacious Rotunda and features an ample seating area where guests can enjoy expansive runway views with a signature Chick’n Shack or ShackBurger. The standalone restaurant mixes angular rooflines, reminiscent of the original Madison Square Park location in New York, with a modern desert palm tree motif.</p>
