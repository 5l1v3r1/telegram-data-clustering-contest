      <p><b>About Open Banking Nigeria:</b> According to its <a href="https://openbanking.ng/about/">website</a>, it is an initiative working with banks, seasoned industry professionals and fintechs to define an open and non-partisan set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to design the API standards. Its objectives include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>analyzing the need of the industry for common API standards among banks and other financial institutions;</li>
        <li>developing the common API standards;</li>
        <li>providing a sandbox and other testing tools for certification;</li>
        <li>promoting adoption of Open Banking standards with stakeholders across Nigeria; and</li>
        <li>enable further innovation in the financial services industry.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>What is API?</b> Application Programming Interface is an approach where your website, application, or software program can interact directly to an ordering interface without having to visit another website first.</p>
