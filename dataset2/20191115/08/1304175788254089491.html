      <h4>Biometric technology will reinvent the industry and drive transformational growth.<br/> </h4>
      <p>NEW YORK, NY – <b>The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council</b> (WTTC), which represents the global Travel &amp; Tourism private sector, released a new survey that found that eight out of 10 Americans boarding domestic or international flights are willing to submit biometric data to enhance their travel experience. </p>
      <p>As part of WTTC’s work on the <b>Seamless Traveller Journey</b> (STJ), the organisation conducted the survey in order to further understand consumers’ willingness to share their electronic photograph with governments and travel companies, in advance of their international travel. </p>
      <p><b>Key Findings include</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>81% of Americans who travel internationally and 79% who travel domestically are willing to share biometric data in order to speed up their traveller journey</li>
        <li>Eight in 10 of US travellers say that they are willing to provide a photo to organisations that might require seeing a passport or photo ID in advance of travelling</li>
        <li>25-34 year olds are both among the largest travelling group and most willing to share biometric data (87%)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <br/><b>Gloria Guevara</b>, President &amp; CEO, WTTC said: “<i>According to our survey, more than 80% of travellers would use their faces to effectively replace their IDs, their boarding passes and even their passports. From booking to destination city, biometric technology will transform the way we travel - creating a safe and seamless experience</i>.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, WTTC convened at the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium for a critical workshop, bringing together public and private sectors with technology providers to agree on models which are globally interoperable, technology neutral and cover the end-to-end journey in an effort to advance the vision of a Seamless Traveller Journey. Findings of the EU-driven biometrics survey were also released at this event.</p>
