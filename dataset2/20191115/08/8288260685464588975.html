      <h1>'Amazing' - Marvelous Nakamba sends brilliant message to Aston Villa fans</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes midfielder's tribute to AVFC supporters following summer move</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Marvelous Nakamba says he is ‘honoured’ to be playing in the Premier League for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> – as he paid tribute to the fans who have helped him feel at home.</p>
      <p>The summer signing from Club Brugge has adapted to life in England seamlessly, playing in every league game since his debut in September's goalless draw with West Ham United at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>“The fans are very friendly, they are amazing, even if we walk in the streets, they are very supportive,’’ Nakamba told <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/nakamba-feeling-at-home-among-epl-stars/">The Herald</a> while on international duty with Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>“I am feeling at home and enjoying the experience.</p>
      <p>“I am giving everything, it is a new league and I am trying to adjust to the new environment, now I am more mature, I have played somewhere and it is a bit easy to adapt.</p>
      <p>“I am 25 now and I think I can handle the pressure. For me it is an honour playing against the best players in the world week-in-week-out.’’</p>

      <p>Playing for Villa means Nakamba is Zimbabwe's most high-profile player - and although he recently turned down the captaincy - he's become the poster boy for his national side.</p>
      <p>Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Botswana and Zambia take place this week and Nakamba added:  “Every game is important for me and, playing at home, with the support we always get, we need to do well and give our supporters something to smile about.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I am very happy to be representing my country and we are training hard to start the qualifiers on a good note.</p>
      <p>“We are pushing each other, giving everything so that we get a (positive) result.’’</p>
