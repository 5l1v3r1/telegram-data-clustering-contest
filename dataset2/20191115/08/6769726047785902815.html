      <p>CONNOLLY Primary School students took their textbooks to the playground for Outdoor Classroom Day last week.</p>
      <p>Now in its third year, the worldwide initiative sees school lessons held outside to celebrate and inspire outdoor learning and play.</p>
      <p>At Connolly PS, activities included yoga, measuring water with cups and containers, an I-spy treasure hunt, painting, gardening and listening to stories.</p>

      <p>“The weather was beautiful and the learning was rewarding,” corporate services officer Chris Richards said.</p>
      <p>She said outdoor learning improved children’s health, engaged them with learning and led to a greater connection with nature.</p>
      <p>“Play not only teaches critical life skills such as resilience, teamwork and creativity, but is central to children’s enjoyment of childhood,” she said.</p>

      <p>“With increasing pressures on childhood, children today are too often overprotected, overscheduled, and overly attached to screens, which is why it’s more crucial than ever before to help get children outdoors.</p>
      <p>Ms Richards said the school had “rich play-based learning experiences” offered specifically to students from kindergarten to Year 2, but Outdoor Classroom Day was celebrated by all years.</p>

      <p>This year, a record 308,000-plus Australian students took part, which included more than 45 per cent of WA’s primary schools.</p>
      <p>The Australian campaign is coordinated by Nature Play WA.</p>
