      <p>The movie, now starting to finally take off after years in the works, is scheduled to begin production next summer before hitting cinemas in December 2021.</p>
      <p>Basically, we’ve got to wait an entire two years until we see The Rock taking down his enemies as the rebellious superhero. Luckily though, he’s given us a sneak-peak of what he will look like doing it.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/?s=the+rock">Johnson</a> shared a picture of himself in the role on social media in the form of a ‘first time ever bad ass’ collaboration between digital artist BossLogic and DC Comics artist Jim Lee.</p>
      <p>Alongside the concept art, the 47-year-old actor said he was ‘honoured’ to join the DC Universe while sharing with his fans his enthusiasm for the role and the movie itself.</p>
      <p>He also expressed how grateful he was to be able to portray an unconventional hero, and one that doesn’t necessarily follow the rules in order to get what he wants.</p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>Like most kids growing up, I dreamed about being a superhero. Having cool superpowers, fighting for what’s right and always protecting the people. It all changed for me, when I was 10yrs old and was first introduced to the greatest superhero of all time – SUPERMAN.<br/><br/>As a kid, Superman was the hero I always wanted to be. But, a few years into my fantasy, I realized that Superman was the hero, I could never be. I was too rebellious. Too rambunctious. Too resistant to convention and authority. Despite my troubles, I was still a good kid with a good heart – I just liked to do things my way.<br/><br/>Now, years later as a man, with the same DNA I had as a kid – my superhero dreams have come true.<br/>I’m honored to join the iconic #DCUniverse and it’s a true pleasure to become, BLACK ADAM.</blockquote>

      <p>Johnson went on to say Black Adam ‘doesn’t toe the mark or walk the line’, describing him as a ‘rebellious, one of a kind superhero who’ll always do what’s right for the people’. However, there’s one big difference between him and Superman, he says: ‘He does it his way.’</p>
      <p>He also said the role is ‘unlike any other’ he’s ever done in his career, before unveiling the release date as December 22, 2021.</p>

      <p>The film’s producer, Hiram Garcia, previously told <i><a href="https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/11/14/the-rock-black-adam-movie-photo-dwayne-johnson-release-date/?fbclid=IwAR0XWND5TE8YiFcRi5soDqLEEsNh10-9piJ9nEfXb3bthtO3x3VCnSR3Axw">ComicBook</a></i> viewers should expect a character who is ‘going through a journey’, stating that although Black Adam was created as a villain, he evolved into an antihero that ‘we always loved and responded to’.</p>

      <p>The Rock added that fans should expect an arc from the character, saying: ‘Black Adam, how he starts, he starts off as a villain.Then, he becomes an anti-hero. And then he might become a hero or we might not.’</p>
