      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/modest-mouse">Modest Mouse</a> have returned with ‘Ice Cream Party’, marking the band’s third new track of 2019.</p>
      <p>The new track from the Washington rockers<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-poison-well-the-first-song-from-modest-mouse-in-four-years-2468986"> follows on from their 7″ single ‘Poison The Well’</a>, although it isn’t as cheery as the title might suggest.</p>
      <p>Instead, it sees frontman Isaac Brock pleading for friendship as he sings: <i>“Well my father doesn’t bring the belt no more/ It’s all right, would you please come over.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i> “Sure you’ve heard that he mom are separated and he’s gone/ He won’t be around/ An ice cream party at my house.”</i>

      <p>The release comes after the band appeared to be  teasing <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/modest-mouse-tease-something-new-is-coming-this-week-with-mystery-countdown-clock-2567251">something new with a mysterious countdown clock earlier this week.</a></p>
      <p>Modest Mouse’s last full-length studio effort, ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-modest-mouse-15974">Strangers To Ourselves</a>‘, arrived in 2015. In a three-and-a-half-star review, <i>NME</i> said: “‘Strangers…’ doesn’t pack the emotional punch of their classic albums, but there’s something laudable about its genre-hopping loopiness.”</p>
