      <h2>Ross is reportedly putting the finishing touches to his contract as he prepares to return to management</h2>

      <p>Former Sunderland manager Jack Ross is set to be named as the new manager of Hibernian.</p>
      <p>That is according to our sister title, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jack-ross-wins-hibs-race-20880439">the Daily Record,</a> who have exclusively revealed the Hibees have chosen the 43-year-old to succeed Paul Heckingbottom, who was sacked earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The report claims <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> also interviewed for the vacant hotseat at Edinburgh rivals Hearts but he has now agreed to take over at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>His first game in charge of Hibernian will be at home against Motherwell next Saturday before he will make an emotional return to St Mirren three days later.</p>
      <p>Ross, of course, guided the Buddies to the Scottish Championship title in 2018 which convinced <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> to make him their new manager.</p>
      <p>Sunderland sacked Ross in October after an indifferent start to their League One campaign. In his first season in charge at the Stadium of Light, he guided the Black Cats to two Wembley finals but failure to win promotion to the Championship proved fatal.</p>
      <p>However, he was keen to get back into work as soon as possible and the report claims Hibernian chiefs Leeann Dempster and Graeme Mathie were 'bowled over' by Ross during his interview.</p>
      <p>It will be the first time Ross has managed in the Scottish top flight and it is said he saw off competition from Raul Caneda Perez, Harry Kewell and John Hughes for the job.</p>
