        <b>S&amp;P 500 3096,63 +2,59.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a brief selloff intraday, the stock market recovered and closed slightly below the 3000 mark, helped by positive comments regarding the US-China trade deal. We observed some conflicting signals among our indicators : our buying/selling index pointed out to some selling pressure whereas daily sentiment indicators indicated some speculation in the option market and the weekly investment survey among active professional portfolio managers showed a rapid decline of optimism from one week to another. These observations put into evidence the nervousness of market participants at this stage of the cycle and an ambivalent position between the fear of being out of the market and the fear of being caught in the next correction.</p>
