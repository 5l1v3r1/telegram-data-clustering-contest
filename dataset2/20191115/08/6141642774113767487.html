      <h2>THE St Martin's Bonfire – which had been postponed until Saturday – has been cancelled as the ongoing wet weather has left the site waterlogged.</h2>

      <p>The popular event was due to take place at the start of the month but was put off for a fortnight due to forecast high winds and heavy rain.</p>
      <p>But due to persistent wet weather – which has seen Jersey Met record 121mm of rain at the Airport already this month – the event has been cancelled. The average monthly rainfall for November is 106mm.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted on Facebook, organisers of the event said: 'It is with great regret that we have made the decision to cancel this year’s bonfire event.</p>
      <p>'The extreme wet weather we have experienced recently have left our car parking fields totally waterlogged. With no other alternatives for parking we had no choice but to cancel.</p>
      <p>'We are sorry to disappoint everybody who comes out to support this event every year. We’re also saddened that we won’t be able to donate money raised at the event to Headway Jersey, our designated charity this year. We will however be supporting Headway Jersey next year.</p>
      <p>'The organising committee would like to assure everyone that we do not take the decision to cancel lightly. We would like to thank our helpers for all the work they have already put in up to this point.</p>
      <p>'We look forward to seeing you all next year, hopefully with some drier weather.'</p>
