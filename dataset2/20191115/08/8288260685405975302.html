      <h1>Iain Lee's blistering attack on I'm A Celebrity over show's aftercare</h1>
      <h2>The DJ appeared on the 2017 series of the show, which begins again on Sunday night, and has spoken about his depression</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:40:03+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Former I'm A Celebrity... star Iain Lee says the aftercare for celebrities who have been on the TV show is "inadequate".</p>
      <p>The DJ appeared on the 2017 series of the show, which begins again on Sunday night, and has spoken about his depression.</p>
      <p>His comments come after shows like Love Island beefed up the mental health care they offer contestants.</p>
      <p>"The mental health care that you get before you go in is probably inadequate (and) when you come out it is definitely inadequate," Lee told the PA news agency.</p>
      <p>The broadcaster, 46, said not getting enough sleep, along with I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here's gruelling challenges and lack of food, was "torture".</p>

      <p>Lee, who has spoken of his own depression, wants the Government to recognise sleep as a fundamental human right.</p>
      <p>He said of the jungle: "Sleep there was a nightmare. I'm a 6ft 4in man and for the most of it they put me in a hammock....</p>
      <p>"You'd get to bed late at night if you were doing a midnight challenge... and then they'd wake you up ridiculously early to do the live show with Ant and Dec. You'd always have to look busy."</p>

      <p>He said a lack of sleep made the celebrities "ratty, miserable and upset".</p>
      <p>Lee, who is working with Eve Sleep on a campaign to highlight social and environmental factors which impact on sleep, said: "I get that that's part of the show... but not having sleep is dangerous. It's a form of torture...</p>
      <p>"I'm not complaining about the jungle. I had a great time. It turned my career around, I loved it but let (this year's contestants) Kate Garraway and Ian Wright have a decent night's sleep."</p>
      <p>The DJ said of the show's aftercare: "There certainly could have been more help."</p>

      <p>"I think they paid for a couple of sessions to see my psychiatrist which I would have seen anyway and I had a phone call asking if I'd like to come in and I said I didn't want to go in and that was that...</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile I'm going off the rails and going nuts. Not as a direct result of the jungle but immediately after the jungle I went a little bit nuts."</p>
      <p>Lee fell out with Rebekah Vardy during his time on the ITV show and she was accused of bullying him, something which Lee denied.</p>
      <p>Vardy has since made headlines around the world after Coleen Rooney claimed her Instagram account was the source of leaked stories about her private life.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lee said of their feud: "I know I didn't like her (Vardy) and I didn't get on with her (in the jungle) but I also don't like Twitter pile-ons....</p>
      <p>"Seeing a whole country pile on to a pregnant woman in that way that people do, made me very, very uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>"Whatever I thought about her. I didn't get on with her and I didn't like her, I still wouldn't wish anybody attacking a pregnant woman like that."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for I'm A Celebrity... said: "The safety and wellbeing of all of our campmates is our number one priority.</p>
      <p>"All campmates have 24-hour access to both medical and psychological support during their stay in camp."</p>
      <p>Iain Lee is working with wellness brand Eve Sleep, as part of its Right To Sleep campaign, to lobby the Government to recognise sleep as a fundamental human right.</p>
