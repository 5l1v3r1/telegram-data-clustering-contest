      <h1>Samson Mow: Stablecoins Are a ‘Mid-Step Towards Hyperbitcoinization’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:59:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/stablecoin">Stablecoin</a> Tether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tether">USDT</a>) is clearly the preference among investors but will not see a retail use case, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/samson-mow">Samson Mow</a> says. </p>
      <p>The Blockstream CSO, who was speaking at Cointelegraph’s ongoing <a href="https://dlive.tv/blockshow-stage-one">BlockShow</a> conference on Nov. 15, noted that Tether’s first-mover advantage placed it in another league from the increasing number of other stablecoins on the market.</p>
      <h3>Mow: Tether won’t be big in retail</h3>
      <p>Mow made the comments during a panel dubbed “The progress of stablecoins — if any? Can I use it yet?” It featured representatives of several stablecoin companies, along with Chia Hock Lai, president of the Singapore FinTech Association. </p>
      <p>“Tether is controversial because it’s the king of stablecoins,” he summarized, wearing a Tether T-shirt. “So it’s no surprise that everyone is trying to come at the king.” </p>
      <p>Continuing, Mow noted but dismissed the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-refutes-paper-naming-usdt-manipulation-as-cause-of-2017-btc-bull-run">public struggles</a> USDT’s issuer is facing, including a United States lawsuit:  </p>
      <blockquote>“Daily trading volume is $20 billion per day — 100 times larger than the next biggest stablecoin. So we see stupid things like theories about one whale manipulating Bitcoin price — billion-dollar lawsuits etc.” </blockquote>
      <p>Nonetheless, for all its success, Tether is unlikely to find a home among everyone consumers, as its utility lies elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think stablecoins will be adopted in retail use cases. They’re used mainly for traders to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities,” Mow added.</p>
      <h3>National digital currencies could kill off stablecoins</h3>
      <p>The panel also discussed the impact of national <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/digital-currency">digital currencies</a> issued by central banks on stablecoins, as well as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/facebook">Facebook’s</a> Libra. </p>
      <p>Going forward, Mow said he envisaged no threat from Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), but national digital currencies such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-of-china-starts-trials-to-restrict-large-cash-transactions">China’s</a> could disrupt stablecoins’ use case. </p>
      <p>“Stablecoins are a mid-step toward hyperbitcoinization. They’re a temporary thing. The main threat they face is from the national cryptocurrencies. How open will those national cryptocurrencies be? …But stablecoins will then have no reason to exist with a national cryptocurrency,” he continued.</p>
      <p>He additionally foresees more USDT — and other stablecoins — migrating from the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum</a> network to Blockstream’s Liquid <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sidechains">sidechain</a> to avoid <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-talks-scalability-ethereum-blockchain-is-almost-full">well-known congestion issues</a>. </p>
      <p>Mow added that Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar stablecoins are currently being developed to launch on the Liquid network in the near future. </p>
      <p>As for Libra, he said, it is already too late:</p>
      <blockquote>“I think Libra is doomed.”</blockquote>
