      <p>Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Washington was not right to propose that Ankara get rid of the Russian S-400 missile defenses it purchased, calling it an infringement of sovereign rights, according to Turkish media.<br/><br/>In a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump urged Erdogan to abandon the S-400 systems that began arriving in Turkey in July despite threats of sanctions from Washington.<br/><br/>Asked after his meeting whether Turkey would consider not activating the S-400s, Erdogan told reporters Ankara cannot harm its relations with Russia. <br/><br/>He also again held out the option of buying US Patriot defenses, Reuters reported.<br/><br/>“We said, ‘We see the proposal to remove the S-400s completely while buying the Patriots as an infringement of our sovereign right and certainly do not find it right,’” he was quoted as saying.<br/><br/>“I cannot abandon the S-400s because of Patriots now. If you are going to give us Patriots, give them,” he added.<br/><br/>Erdogan also said that he saw a much more positive approach to the F-35 issue from Trump.</p>
