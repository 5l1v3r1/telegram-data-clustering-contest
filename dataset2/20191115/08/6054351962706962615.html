      <h1>Run The Jewels &amp; Shaq Team Up With Volcom For Wild Snowboard Ad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-15T08:00:00+00:00">15 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44471/title.rtjs-killer-mike-el-p-want-you-to-call-out-the-bullshit">Killer Mike and El-P</a> — the colorful Hip Hop duo better known as <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51640/title.run-the-jewels-post-up-at-rick-rubins-studio-to-work-on-rtj4-album">Run The Jewels</a> — have teamed up with Volcom and the U.S. Snowboard Team for a new ad to announce the clothing brand is the U.S. Snowboard Team’s official apparel partner through the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games.</p>
      <p>Written by comedian/musician and El Producto’s wife<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.23254/title.killer-mike-f-emily-panic-anywhere-but-here-prod-el-p"> Emily Panic,</a> the ad features a phony press conference starring Killer Mike as a coach and El-P as an overconfident “snowboarder” who actually has no idea how to shred but is determined to be on the team.</p>

      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/videos/id.23407/title.shaquille-oneal-goes-undercover-as-lyft-driver">Shaquille O’Neal</a> and comedian Tim Robinson also make appearances — with the former starring as a skeptical fan and the latter playing the “United States Commissioner of Snowboard” whose scene ends with his signature line, “I am Kazaam!”</p>
      <p>“I just know the guys really well and I’m familiar with their comedy dynamic so I wrote for that,” Panic tells HipHopDX. “I thought it would be funny to have Mike speaking in platitudes and Jaime [El-P] being overly confident about competing in a sport that he has no experience with.</p>
      <p>“I’m a big fan of Tim and Shaq too, so I just wrote something I thought would be fun for them and overall funny and surreal. And Volcom was cool and ran with my weird script.”</p>
      <p>The 2020 Winter Games begin on February 4, 2020 and wrap up on February 20.</p>
