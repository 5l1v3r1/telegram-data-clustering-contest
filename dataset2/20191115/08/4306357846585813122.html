      <h1>‘Unbelievable’: Pat Nevin raves about Chelsea FC star Christian Pulisic</h1>
      <h2>Blues legend Pat Nevin is impressed with Christian Pulisic's performances for Chelsea FC in recent weeks</h2>

      <h3>Christian Pulisic is the player to watch at Chelsea FC given his unbelievable talent, according to Blues legend Pat Nevin.</h3>
      <p>The United States international scored in Chelsea FC’s 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge last weekend.</p>
      <p>Pulisic has netted five goals and has made three assists in his last nine games in all competitions for the west London side.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old scored his first Chelsea FC hat-trick in a 4-2 victory over Burnley last month before Pulisic netted at Watford.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC manager Frank Lampard initially used the American playmaker sparingly following his arrival at Stamford Bridge in the summer.</p>
      <p>Pulisic moved to the Blues in a £57m deal from Borussia Dortmund after Lampard’s predecessor Maurizio Sarri oversaw the transfer.</p>
      <p>However, the American’s performances have left Lampard with no choice but to play Pulisic in the Chelsea FC team.</p>
      <p>Former Blues midfielder Nevin believes Pulisic is a big prospect for Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>“Pulisic is the one to watch,” Nevin told Irish radio station <i>Newstalk</i>.</p>
      <p>“He could be unbelievable. I keep saying it every week. He has got stuff I haven’t seen for a long time. He can play on both sides – right and left, unbelievable pace, natural finisher and he’s a sweet kid as well.”</p>
      <p>Pulisic has scored 19 goals in 127 games in all competitions during his four-season stay at Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea FC No22 won the German Cup in 2017 but missed out on the Bundesliga crown during his stint at the Westfalenstadion.</p>
      <p>Pulisic will be hoping to feature in the Chelsea FC team against defending champions Manchester City at The Etihad on Saturday 23 November.</p>
